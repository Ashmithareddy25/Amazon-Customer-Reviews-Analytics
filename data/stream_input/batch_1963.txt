0307592731|4.0|Wild is Strayed's memoir of her 1,100-mile solo hike on the Pacific Crest Trail. However, don't be fooled into thinking this is a travel narrative or a serious backpacking story. It is not. Strayed basically went on the trail with very little preparation and information. In fact, she was so ill-equipped for her hike that I imagine serious outdoorsman grimacing in displeasure and judgment whilst reading it. If you take your outdoor literature seriously, you will HATE this book. With that out of the way, let me tell you what this book IS about. It is about Strayed losing her way after her mother's death and the break-up of her marriage and her somewhat misguided attempt to find herself by undertaking a ridiculously difficult physical challenge. There are those of you (I'm looking at you, Jill and Ti) who hated this book because of Strayed's behavior (on-trail sex, drug use, lack of preparedness, whining), but I'm not one of those haters. I see Strayed as a damaged, confused young woman who had reached the end of her rope and didn't know how to find a way out. Rather than heading down the bad path she was on, she chose to step out of real life and take on this quest. The fact that she succeeded is a testament to her strength and perseverance. I think this trip was a crucible where Strayed entered a confused girl and came out a woman. If you like blisteringly honest memoirs about people doing foolish things but with a big and honest heart, then this a must-read. If however, you can't stand the follies of the young and foolish or people who venture out into nature without knowing what they are doing, then steer clear as this book will annoy you to no end.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|I really loved this book.  I am 8 years old.  It was funny.  You should read it.  You will like it.
B000002OTK|4.0|I love the movie and if you're a fan you'll enjoy the record just the same. The only thing is i kinda wish the album cover didn't look like a dull photocopy as i was looking forward to framing it.
B004Q7DQLS|4.0|Call me superficial, but my main reason for putting off this book is that I wasn't drawn in by the cover art. I read this series completely out of order; although I enjoyed each book, I would have appreciated the character development and nuances if I had read the books in order. I have a great appreciation for the author's long-range plot development. As a full body of work, Thea Harrison's series is very complex and the books interlock well without taking away from each set of characters' individual stories. Like all the books in the series this book was really well plotted and well written. I think this was the third Elder Race novel I read, and it was due to wanting to know Pia and Drago's story that I finally grabbed it at the local library. I am happy to report I enjoyed the heck out of the book! Its playful and fun and the idea of stealing a dragon's treasure (she snagged a penny) was very original.<br /><br />This is a wonderful series, and this is a very well written book; my personal dislike of the female character may not be an issue for others and this book is worth is as a continuation and blending of the ploy lines that seem to work somewhat concurrently, not so much as flowing from one to another like many series do. This type of plot weaving is the main reason I give this author kudos for being able to manage such a complex infrastructure.
0345479092|4.0|There is no one book for every baby, but I like what this book has to say. It's a big wordy, so if you're not the reading type it may frustrate you to work through, but it has some good ideas.

B000JIHP88|5.0|I bought this for a friend's shower and she absolutely loves it. It looks good, sounds good, and the baby loves it.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|good game a little unrealistic when infantry with guns blow up tanks.  each unit should have strengths against some and weakness against others. example hummer strong against infantry but weak against heavy armor. I apologize if that's in the programming but I just don't notice it.

B0051ANPZQ|4.0|I found this book offered online and have not regretted my purchase. I loved both of the standing ovations scenes.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|Not as good as Gone Girl.  It was OK . I don't enjoy book reports, so I'm not going to go into it.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Love the book. Love the show. Love everything. Can't wait for season 2 to come out on video and season 3 on tv.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|11/22/63  No time to write an essay right now, but I liked it a lot.  There's already 11 words.  Why so hard?
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|I can definitely see the appeal of this book to teenage readers.  It's got a handsome, selfless male lead, a misjudged, sweet heroine and angst galore.  I KNOW I would have loved this book when I was 15.  That said, now that I'm the mother of a daughter who will be 15 soon, I worry that fiction like this will have her believing that there are 18-year old boys out there who will be as kind, patient and introspective as Holder.<br /><br />Girls, Holder is just not possible.  18-year old guys are physiologically incapable of being patient and selfless for an extended period, as Lovely Holder was.  (Short periods, maybe.)  Will many of these guys mature into considerate, thoughtful and wonderful potential mates?  Definitely.  But in those early years, hormones are still their puppet master.  As a mom, I have serious issues with the Holders and Edward Cullens of the fiction world.  I worry that my daughter will have unrealistic expectations of male-female relationships during her teen years.<br /><br />So, while \\"Hopeless\\" was fairly well written, the unrealistic male protagonist really put me off.  In addition, the first 50% of the book dragged.  I felt like I was treading water and not getting anywhere.  When the storyline did pick up, there were some HEAVY issues that needed more than the cursory treatment they received.  Both Holder and Sky were going to need some major therapy after their shocking discoveries, but none seemed forthcoming.  It irked me that love was going to be their salvation.  Love and a strong relationship with your partner certainly count for a lot when weathering emotional storms, but sometimes it's not enough.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't put it down and loved the twists and turns in the book.  Made me really want to see how it was going to end.
B008602KQI|5.0|After reading the book, I thought the movie was a must see. I was impressed with the visual and special effects. My whole family very much enjoyed it, and would highly recommend it to over 13.
B003O86FMW|2.0|Sorry I got into the Hunger Games and won't be getting into any more trilogy books.  The second and third are always a disappointment.
B009369Z8A|5.0|Instantly one of my favorites. As with any movie that is &#34;based on true events&#34; I'm sure there is some stretching of the truth, but who cares?
B0027MJU00|4.0|I liked it but it wasn't as exciting as Gone Girl.  What the heck is a word?  I keep writing.
B005LAII1C|5.0|As soon as I put this movie in and sat down, I thought to myself, &#34;This is ridiculous. A talking teddy bear? What am I watching?&#34; It started a little slow but once it got going I found it to be very entertaining. I watched the unrated version though? If you're in to comedy, I'm sure you'll like it. AND it has the digital copy(iTunes or Flixster/Ultra Violet - I believe you can only choose one?)/bluray/dvd action.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Jodi Picoult is an amazing author! The Pact had me laughing and crying. This is a page turner. The only part I didn't love was the flashbacks. Although I do though they were necessary.
0765325950|1.0|I will wait for the Kindle version, but I am not happy about it, hence the single star.  If it were out now, I would happily pay the hardback price for it.  Why don't the publishers release the ebooks at the same time as the hardbacks with the same price, and then drop the ebook price when the paperback editions come out?
B005HSG3VK|5.0|Protects my new Kindle Fire & it's much easier to hold & read the Kindle .... basic, non-fancy, & easy to use.

The smoothness of movement of each animation of all these genius animators are an excellent reminder for everybody interested in improving even more their own animation techniques!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Excellent!  I have never been an avid reader but this book along with my Kindle Fire HD make me want to just read and read.  Getting ready to start the next book in the Hunger Games Trilogy!

B002BSHWUU|5.0|the set is awesome but the box was smashed when it arrived which is very unfortunate because as a box set, it would be nice to keep it in the box which is high gloss black as seen in the pix but it was broken and had to be thrown out.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Captivating- really couldn't put it down. When I was forced to put it down I was still thinking about it. Nicholas Sparks has done it again.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|Delicada y sutil, simplemente extraordinaria y todo el material extra esta muy bien cuidado.<br />Una edicion que sin duda alguna vale la pena tener en casa.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Very entertaining and addictive. I watched 2 seasons within a week! I hope they film a lot of seasons in the future.
B00A80SHFM|3.0|Ok - first off let me clarify that while I saw the movie in a high quality theatre, I did not actually listen to this recording. But you can't improve mediocre singing simply by transferring it to CD or mp3. (That said, that latter voice of Eponine was great and Gavroche was outstanding as well - interestingly both of them sounded much like the voices in the recording I'm noting below - they must have listened to that when making the movie.)<br /><br />There are many fine recordings of Les Mis out there that cover the entire work. My personal favorite is:<br /><br />Les Miserables Complete Symphonic Recording<br /><br />If you have your heart set on what you heard in the movie I guess this one is ok, but if the music speaks to you at all, get one of the other ones.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|Tommy Lee and Meryl Streep are hilarious, just short of a PG movie.  Didn't really need the sexual aspect, I believe less of it would've been more.....
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|Although I did enjoy the book, I thought the story went a little to far over the top  for believability.  I enjoy Pendergast when he is closer to Sherlock Holmes instead of James Bond......
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book, although written well, just didn't keep me wanting more.  I was simply frustrated with the relationship between the two main characters.
B00A6N8F4Y|3.0|I liked parts of the movie but I think they just added juicy scences just to keep us from falling asleep. If you have nothing to do this would be an okay way to pass the time.
015206057X|5.0|Mem Fox has a way with the cadence and expansive vocabulary that support a simple idea in a playful and novel way.  I love her writing.  Check her web site as she reads and sings this lovely story.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|This was far more touching that I ever thought it would be - although it moved slow in some parts, it was well worth the wait. My husband forced me to watch this and I am so glad I did, I love K!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Quick, enjoyable from the beginning to the end.  Reads more like Grishams earlier books, bringing the reader in quickly with a complex character.
B002BJGYTY|5.0|my little sister loves this show and without cable she couldn't watch it so this was a great gift idea for those whom have releatives who like this show
B004GJXQ20|4.0|Great novel. Great for those who haven't yet seen the tv series, but also good for those who have!<br />Would recommend to people who have an interest in the politics behind the drama and also a bit of love for fantasy themes.<br />Rated 4/5. Only dislike is because at times it is difficult to read due to grammar being used and also the use of many italics.<br />Aside from that a very satisfying un-put-down-able book :)

0784011710|5.0|Just as excellent a film as I remembered it being,  This is the film in which Meryl Streep proved her unbelievable acting ability and established herself as the best actress of our age.  And, for those who haven't seen Kevin Kline in a non-comedic role, this will show you drama is an important part of his repertoire.
B004K4AVAG|5.0|this was a good cd with great music my niece loved it says i'm her favorite uncle, just a gag
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|What a great story of honor, chivalry, courage and fear.  Well written, easy flowing, and yet insightful to the bone.  Having had the actual pilots to interview, Makos had a tremendous challenge to weave together the story of two pilots who for only just a few, yet life-changing moments, met over the skies of Germany.  Mission accomplished - the reader will be lost in the lives of these two boys who grew to be men while sitting in the cockpits of their respective airplanes!  Highly recommend!

B00005JMFQ|1.0|The first DVD I ordered took about three weeks to arrive.  Amazon kindly sent me a replacement.  The first one then arrived the day after the replacement and was totally damaged so I kept the second one which I would have returned in thanks for their sending me a second one at no cost.<br /><br />Half of the movie on the DVD was unwatchable.  I have not watched the second DVD and can only hope that it is okay.
B004H83IFA|5.0|as a fan of kirsten dunst from day one,i am very happy to say i have enjoyed every single film she has been in,as i cant say that about everyone,with jim carrey and adam sandler in mind,even though most of theirs are in my all time favourites. a lot of kirsten dunsts films take someone to really want to follow a story and this is why sometimes they might get bad press and negative reviews.especially true stories,just like marie antonette,anything with a story based on rea llife just seems to be too much for some people who would rather just watch a comedy with a few jokes and no story or james bond with no story but loads of explosions.some of kirsten dunsts films i personally would never watch if she was not in them,the same can be said for other actresses i see every film lik daota fanning and kristen stewart, the indie films and obscure films are often the best and people need to give them a chance andn ot just the big blockbusters

1594487154|5.0|The best business, personal growth, and educational book I read in a long time is To Sell is Human: The Surprising Truth About Moving Others by Daniel H. Pink.<br />Pink's thesis is that in the new information driven economy we are free agents and spend most of our work life selling. Survey after survey shows that most think salespeople are smarmy, slick, and have a con or two up their sleeves.  This is not so and Pink points to new research on the impact of selling in the United States, it is a significant part of our entrepreneurial DNA.<br />As in most of Pink's book, the text is in simple non-jargon language without hooky phrases or methods.  The examples used and exercise given make common sense.  To sell is to be human because as social creatures we strive to get along and get our way.  He shares how to make the right pitch and how the extroverts are not always the best sellers.<br />Pink weaves a lot of emotional intelligence into one key ingredient to becoming a better seller or simply a better person who will in essence make us all get better along and as Steven Covey coined the phrase make a `win-win' situation possible.<br />This book should be required reading for all of us as we fumble around in trying to regain our mojo and get out of this funk cause by the great recession. America has always been the shining city on the hill and that is partly in our belief that we can sell our ideas that make for a better world. Pink clears a path and gives you the tools to take charge.
B007T9UIMA|5.0|My granddaughter had asked for items of One Direction.  She loved this.  I'm sure she will enjoy watching it over and over.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|My only complaint is that the picture quality felt like I was watching it on VHS. Other than that... What a surprise! Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones have not missed a beat. And Josh Brolin may actually do a better job of playing Tommy Lee Jones that Mr. Jones does himself! Jemaine Clement is excellent as Boris and Emma Thompson plays straight and silly to a T. Great turn by Bill Hader too as a surprise MIB agent. The special effects and make up effects have not lost a beat either. Amazing that it's been 14 years since the original!<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|It was what you would expect from a Stephen King novel. Well written and a very unique plot. It is a long novel, yet the plot keeps you engaged and curious to find out what is going to happen next.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|This romance captures you right from the beginning.  Miss Austen, though never married, understood true romance.  She describes both Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy so vividly the reader cannot fail to have a pure picture in mind.  I would fail to see how anyone could read this novel and not want to start a new romance.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Just like a good soap opera, the thrill moves on. I have enjoyed the Jack Ryan<br />activities, and it is good to seen his son and nephews move into the breach.
0307951529|2.0|I appears that this book is another idea of making money.  Write a book that targets the \\"normal\\" person looking for advice on how to start up a business for a small amount of money and then sell it to them and make a fortune by not really helping them.

Clearly, a con.

0345803485|3.0|It came as a revelation to me that women are interested in the feelings, the emotions, and the inner life of the characters in these tales, as a necessary background to the distasteful sweaty objectification of the women and men in the usual BDSM genre of soft porn. When I compare this with Ann Rice's Beauty series, replete with whips and chains, and nary an introspection in sight, I finally understand why women find most male-style porn disinteresting and distasteful.<br /><br />The woman, Anna, is concerned with the WHY of Christin's perverse needs, and actually would like to SAVE him. The foreground is the battleground of Christian's tormented emotional life; the juicy sexuality lies in the background. Anna sees him as a full fledged human being whom she cares for, and is willing to put up with this BDSM nonsense in order to try to understand him. The book was in such good taste that I felt embarassed to be reading about this young woman and her \\"lover\\". Ann Rice goes with a traditional \\"smell the leather and sweat\\" approach. It is what it is, and you know going in what is coming up.<br /><br />The \\"problem\\" with Shades is that it is so damned civilized that I must read through page after page of Anna's feelings about what Christian must be feeling, and her empathy for poor Christian, and oh yes she DID just orgasm, but only after parsing so many emotions that the poor male reader is left dumbfounded. Is this what women are really going through as we poor males go about our erotic business? Now I think I understand why it must be so exhausting to be a woman in an intimate relationship with a (usually) clueless male, and why a man can watch TV, have a romp duing a commercial, and return to the game without missing a beat. He REALLY DOESN'T KNOW the depths of introspection that women experience in these moments. Perhaps \\"50 Shades\\" is the precurser to a new wave of erotica that will finally bridge the still poorly understood gulf between the male and female experiences of the erotic. All I can tell you is that these seem to be interminable sex scenes without sex, and I was truly lost in Anna's mind. For anyone interested in a guided tour of the landscape inhabited by Anastasia and Christian, I recommend [[ASIN:0679769560 Different Loving: The World of Sexual Dominance and Submission]]<br /><br />The movie [[ASIN:B00BW6SOIQ Secretary]] is another example of the almost post-modern approach to erotica, which women found interesting and men puzzling.nces of the erotic.

B008OOYALE|5.0|Now that I've played it awhile, I'm very happy with taking the chance downloading it. It's not very hard to level up, but it is difficult to upgrade items or expand your land. You really don't have to have gold to get dragons, because you can breed what dragons you have to get rare ones. But you do need coins to expand your land and way more coins to clear that land to be able to use it. You also need a lot of coins to upgrade your habitats and farms. Time is really all you need to play and enjoy this game. Time to grow food, time to get enough food to feed your dragons, time to gain enough coins to upgrade your farms and habitats, time to breed dragons, time to hatch your Dragon eggs. Time is how you play this game, gold is how you can play it faster. (expensively) Still a very enjoyable game.

0316069434|5.0|I think we have read all of the Bosch novels and this is one of the best, if not the best.  Unlike other detective series which seem to evolve into a set formula, Connelly always surprizes with well thought out plots.  Don't care that much for the Lincoln Lawyer series, but will read Bosch as long as there is a new one.

B004TTHLBE|5.0|This book blew my mind. It's no wonder Gaiman got so many awards for this book. Groundbreaking. I know I'll return to it again and again.
B005LAIISU|5.0|Although I loved the Shrek movies, Shrek 3, was not quite up to the standards of the other 3 movies in the series. The same can not be said of the Ice Age series! All of the movies are as good as the rest, and this, the fourth movie of the series, is no exception. It is well worth getting to add to your movie collection.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|Awesome app like the capability to download video and play later. I recently downloaded a 1 hour video and watch it in my car without wifi or mobile network.
B008D37J6O|1.0|Whenever I tried opening it, it said it quit working. I didn't even have the app for more than a couple minutes.
B006LSZECO|2.0|The 3 chapters I read were written in first person. I really don't like this kind of writing. I never buy books written this way. Sorry, I know it has been on the best seller list for a long time. I really tried, but couldn't get past the 3rd chapter. I won't be finishing it.<br /><br />Linda Parsons
B005LAII80|5.0|Dredd was one of the best action films of 2012. It bombed in the states, so here's hoping that it sells well on home video, because there are more stories to tell. Buy it!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Typical of Vince's works.  Plenty of action, intrigue, torture, murder and mayhem.  The cast of characters is mostly unchanged except for the addition of the new bad guys.
0765325950|1.0|As I have previously posted on Tor's website, Tor's facebook page and on amazon itsel, I leave here my personal protest for the lack respect of Tor/Macmillan/Harriet for their customers.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|Without some kind of viewfinder on the Kindle, the camera function is practically useless.  Imagine holding the tablet over your head pointing backwards to see what you are taking a picture of and trying to tap the click area with out moving the camera.  Pretty difficult and stupid.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It has a lot of ads, but it`s free so I can't complain. Definitely a good way to pass the time.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Proof of Heaven<br />It was written from a different point of view on an age old subject of heaven. If you have read others on this subject of heaven you must read this one.He returned to stand true on what he felt, saw and remembers from a science view point.
B006LSZECO|5.0|While the book was slow to start, I was confident in this writer because I loved her other books.  Stick with the story because it is a twisting concept that boggles the mind!
1439102724|5.0|Jodi Picoult is simply the best author; touching on subjects others would fear to tackle, and she does it so well.  Fair and balanced in all cases.  I have not yet read a book of hers that did not dredge up a well of emotion that had been pushed down for many, many a year.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Coreys one-liners become repeticious, tiresome and annoying.  This character needs a facelift, if not major surgery?  The<br />Lion with different stripes
0345803485|3.0|Purchased for a neighbor at her request.  She seemed to enjoy the book.  I did not read it, so don't know what more I can say.
B005IQZB14|4.0|This was a great novel. Very captivating and relatable - I read it over a 3 day course. I would have given it 5 stars but it left me wanting more and unfulfilled.
B007UQRW62|5.0|This movie never seems to loose it's self in time, one that will always I feel be around for years to come, great movie for any generation to view.  I just loved the whole package, so very well done indeed and would say right now please purchase this gem, wonderful to add to your dvd collections it's great!.  Barbara Petersen - Australia.
B0033VUH6A|5.0|The Hurt Locker is one of those movies that transports you to a part of the world that you haven't experienced unless you've been an armed soldier in combat.  Intense and filled with anxiety and tension as well as humor and realistic interpersonal relationships. Interesting that a woman director made such a male oriented movie.  Extremely realistic we'll made movie.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Enjoying this read. As a believer in heaven and our life thereafter, I find it interesting to ponder the transition stage.
B005LAII1C|5.0|If you haven't already seen in theaters i highly reccomend this movie. Its one that will make you laugh over and over.<br />I ordered this and had no problems at all with the shipping. Infact i ordered before Christmas and was able to get the free super shipping on it so i cannot say anything that went wrong. Love it
B00633W614|4.0|I have been a fan of Archer's for many years and his latest books are a treat.  I can't wait for the next installment of The Clifton Chronicles.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|Everyone i know loves puzzle games and i got it for my mom on Christmas who thought it was great!
6304490119|5.0|We had seen this movie before and it was good.  We purchased it to watch and put into a library for future watches.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Who doesn't have a pinterest?  I love this app and it works great! Super easy to figure out too. R
B006LSZECO|1.0|I debated for months if I should buy this book.  i know every book has good and not so good reviews, however I wish I had gone with my gut and passed on this one.  Without spoiling the book, I will only say I was so disappointed in the ending that it made me angry that I paid twelve dollars for this read.  I felt I was ripped off.  I don`t know how this can be considered a best seller.
B0086700CM|4.0|this game is adfictive and fun. but it CAN get a little bit on the boring side. it can also get very twitchy. but its fret and it is worth the zero cents.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This  book is really touching and sweet , Charlie's characters  is amazing and thoughtful , the characters were really like high school life just alittle . The quotes in the book make you think I love  it. The child hood memories are wow. In that moment, I swear we were infinite. Another one pleease!
B008HK3XKO|5.0|Case fits easily on the Kindle Fire HD. Installation is very easy. Some reviews indicated it is difficult to charge the Kindle with the cover on. I have been able to charge the Kindle with the cover open. I have not had to remove the Kindle to charge it. The cover is sturdy and makes a great stand for the Kindle when viewing on a table or desk. It does add some weight to the Kindle, but it is minimal.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved it. It's a must read  no matter what age!! It really makes you think of all the things going on in your life.
B005DD7MH8|5.0|Bradley Cooper & Al Pacino make an excellent pair.  I really like the unique twists in the film.  To be honest I liked this movie better than Inception with Leonardo DiCaprio.  For reasons I can't quite figure out it really makes you feel good at the end. Not too many of those anymore.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|The third wheel is another great book in the series<br /><br />Can't wait for the next book<br /><br />You should also get the other books in the series
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Ordered this for Christmas and it arrived extremely quickly! Purchased it for my son who is a big fan of the show and was quite happy to receive another season for Christmas!
B007XIC1GI|4.0|Both halves of this book are interesting in their own ways. The stories throughout his childhood and tour days are out of this world.
B000024C7W|5.0|I have been aware of this piece of work since its release.  Stevie Wonder is simply a master at what he does.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I thought it as a great book, so many emotions. I cant wait to read the next book. It was just wonderful
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|The acting is bad.  Let's get that out of the way at the beginning.  There are SEALs, not actors, they aren't going to act well as a rule.<br /><br />Everything else is awesome.  The fights scenes are amazing, the infiltration scenes even better.  I highly recommend getting it, watching it, then watching it with the director's commentary as you get to hear about the parts that are based on real events.  I hope they make a sequel and with the wars winding down maybe the SEALs will have more free time to work on it.
1423124111|5.0|and the present.  What a gorgeous publication!  Besides the beautiful pictures,  take a second look and read about the history.  A great addition to any Disney Fan's collection!
B000KIPT30|3.0|I have lots of audio coming from my computer. I wanted to use digital audio output to quiet the feedback from the computer itself. Then I convert it to analog. The signal is clean. I bought converters to take everything in and out of this as quarter inch plugs and hooked it all up. The great part is being able to control the volume on each individual item from my computer chair. The bad news is sometimes in order to quite the feedback I have to unplug one or more of the other plugs to get it quiet on the channel that I am interested in. But I'm still reasonably happy with my purchase. There was another brand I had been looking at along side this one that was about the same price. If I had the disposable money I would buy that one and compare/contrast but I'm broke so I'll live with what I got.
B00A8Z6KN8|5.0|Howard Shore did not disappoint and delivered another excellent soundtrack. The themes from the previous trilogy were beautifully woven with the new. It was money well spent.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|simple game, yet somehow very addicting.  it reminds me of going to beach arcades and playing the quarter machines.  the bonuses are decent, good to have something to work toward.
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|A new character, an insane, one-eyed weasel named Buckminster, or Buck (Simon Pegg) for short, is introduced in this film.  Of all the Ice Age characters, he is now my favorite.  This film was just enjoyable to our friends that have seen it, my wife and myself.  As usual, Sid and Scrat are up to heir usual adventures.  The Scrat and Scratte interactions regarding love and the acorn are really enjoyable.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was the best book by far!  I love how it jumped to different future dates quickly in the epilogue.
B005LAIISA|4.0|This one is not as good as the Dawn of the Dinosaurs.  My wife didn't care for it as she said it reminds her too much of Pirates of the Caribbean.  I think the film is a 6 out of 10; but, I think children under 12 would probably really like it.
145210655X|5.0|A must-read for anyone with a four-year-old! I laughed when I saw it, and bought 2 copies for my sons to read to their boys. They both agreed that this is a great book.
0785162348|4.0|This is a great book. I like the concept art and I love the storyboard sections, really fun to see the original vision vs the outcome.<br /><br /> I feel however, like most movie books, that there is too much final movie content in it. I've seen the movie, I don't need lots of full page glossy splashes of scenes I've watched. If you're going to show that stuff, it should be for a purpose, like to demonstrate the final product of the design process. I bought the book to see the behind the scenes thought process that went into bringing what I saw on the screen to fruition.<br /><br />That said, there is a good number pf pages dedicated to that process and you will be happy with your purchase!
B0050DIWFC|3.0|The trick with books on the digital era is that the beginning has to be good. Because at least I test the books before I buy them.<br />This is the classical book you're hooked to because you want to know who is the killer. It starts well. It plays with the timeline, and the characters are realistic. But then, the writer got tired or bored, and the pace got irritatingly slow.<br />So, I wouldn't recommend it, but also, I've read worst books.
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|There are many great things going on in this film, but there is also something missing that should've brought it together. Pierce's character seems to be trying too hard to make you hate him, not because of his performance, but that fact that his hatred of the moonshiners is never fully understood, therefore falling short in justification.<br />Great ending, Tom Hardy takes the film to the level of greatness it achieves. Some people give Shia Labeouf crap, but I just don't see why. He is a good actor and doesn't disappoint in this film.<br /><br />Worth a looksie fer sure.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|i love my kindle fire hd, but i had this app.  i never got to looking at the pictures or video i took because i was too busy trying to figure out how to take a pic of something besides myself.  if you want to take a pic of anything besides yourself you have to turn your kindle toward the subject, then angle it so you can see the screen, and take your pic.  are you kidding me? very poor way to take pics these days.  kindle fire hd is made for things like skype and taking pics of yourself, not for taking pics of others.
B005LAII80|5.0|I wanted to see this in the theatre but was kind of hesistant, so just decided to wait till it came out. Hate that I waited to see this, it was an awesome movie that I could watch again. Great action and story. Amazing graphics and Blu Ray quality. Glad to own this!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love spending time each day on Pinterest - the application was entered on my Kindle for easy access and it's also easy to sort by category or view all interests.
141694737X|5.0|I bought this for a friend who has a new baby.  I read this book many times over to my grandchildren who loved being able to lift the flaps and see what is underneath.  Great book.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|haven't had a lot of chances to use it but what I have looked at made it appear to be a worthwhile app to have
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I watched it 4 times. Wish i would of bought it than rent it. My son and I thought it was so funny.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|It was recommened by a couple friends and I am so glad they did.  Can't wait for Sunday night to see more.
0765325950|1.0|Like everyone else, I'm giving this book the lowest rating for there being no ebook version. I suspect, like the last book that wasn't released with an ebook version, I'll end up with the book from an alternate means, despite the fact that I have been throwing money at my screen for this book for two years.<br /><br />If you don't want my money, that's fine by me. Someone else will take it, I'm sure.
0060235152|5.0|The words and pictures are great for the kids. My kids love reading and re-reading this book. We read at least one Eric Carle book a day.
B009D5VPTI|4.0|This movie worked really well over all. The storyline was great. There was a good transition from beginning to end, where it was neither missing information to the story, nor had excessive information. It had the laughs, the action, and the emotional connection with family. Great movie to watch with the family!
0439023491|5.0|I think my daughter read this in about a week and that was because she had to go to school during the day. Great for the preteen crowd.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|It would be easier to tell what I didn't like about it......zero. Fantastic movie. Great acting. Incredable production. wonderful history lesson about one of our founding fathers
B0031QUTBA|5.0|Bought this for my wife, now I love the series, price was a bit high (In my opinion), but would purchase all over again.
034580404X|5.0|hey girl sup girl dang my momma liked dem books but they were a little raunchy and cray bye girl
B009OYSFDM|5.0|This show is full of action and it has a good story to go along with it and the actors that play the characters do a wonderful job.
0545265355|5.0|I enjoyed these books. The triology was a quick read. If you liked the first movie, you'll enjoy the book even more.
0440237688|5.0|BUT I wish I had. This was a great book and such a great idea of how to describe a dystopian society. To imagine that certain talents that a child has, which is only one talent, is a job for the rest of your life. But to not have any emotions or feelings and learning how to manage that and what to do with it given you can feel has been written incredibly in this book. Love it and would recommend to others. I recommended it a friend who continued to not want to read it but when she did, she could not put it down and wanted to read the rest of the quartet!
B0015DROBO|5.0|Very fast paced, leaving the reader eager to read more. Hard to put down. Looking forward to reading the next :&#34;The Girl Who Played with Fire&#34;.
B007HACDLK|4.0|This a very enjoyable book to read.  All the characters are intriguing to read about.  I am looking forward to another book by Vince Flynn.
B006P96PAO|5.0|great movie!!!!!! changed our life! Everyone family should own this movie! we have so we can watch it many more times
0545265355|5.0|They arrived quickly and they are good quick reads for the whole family to enjoy with drama, adventure and romance.
0810989956|5.0|My 8 year old daughter spent Christmas day and the next three days with her head in this book.  One of her favorite presents.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|The price is excellent for this collection. I would recommend this not to only fans of the movies but to anybody. If you can enjoy sci fi this would be a must they are classics. They just don't make them like these anymore and they live up to their name even to this day. So all in all I would say for the value an on blu ray buy it.
B008Z9YLV2|1.0|I thought it was disturbing that people could find entertainment in something like this.  The story was sad.  In a world where we have violent school shootings and we find those things so terrible it is amazing to me that people could sit down and find enjoyment from children in the same age range brutally killing each other.  I also had a hard time with the enjoyment the people had while they watched the killings and how worked up they got over it.  Maybe I missed the point of the whole movie?  Maybe I was just distracted by the brutality and far fetched costumes.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game is weird but fun. Its addicting and exiting to see what puzzles are next. Also it has good graphics.
B009329Y30|4.0|This was a good story and had pretty decent acting in it.  It had enough mix of suspense that my husband even enjoyed it.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|Every one in the family likes this game. The kids love it. Even my five year old  has no trouble playing it.My husband and i have trouble getting the kindle back from the kids.
0316227706|5.0|loved it.  it was a gift and she loved it.  great pix of dogs. they look so happy.  also loved the book and web sites
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was a really cute book,I enjoyed it & plowed through the pages. It would have been even beter had it been longer!
B003LQMZS0|5.0|~BACKGROUND~<br />I purchased this toy for my 2 month old son to entertain him and aid in his motor skill development.<br /><br />~PROS~<br />- Bright, bold, contrasting colors.<br />- Each leg on the giraffe has a different stimulator - mirror, rattle, teether and beads.<br />- Different textures on the giraffe.<br />- Velcro loop/strap on top makes it easy to attach to many places - strollers, carriers, cribs, activity mats, etc.<br />- Can be used independently without attaching simply as a toy.<br />- Good price.  Comparably priced toys in local stores are much less entertaining.<br />- Appears to be well made.<br /><br />~CONS~<br />- None so far!<br /><br />~TIPS~<br />- When washing this or any other baby toy I strongly recommend using a baby-specific laundry detergent such as [[ASIN:B004HCUMAA Dreft Baby Laundry Detergent Liquid, 32 Loads, 50-Ounce]] or [[ASIN:B005W2MVJ4 Dapple Fragrance-Free Baby Laundry Detergent 2x - 50 oz]].<br />- Keep an eye on the small mirror.  As your baby gets older and stronger and the more the toy gets used and washed, he/she may be able to dislodge the mirror which can obviously be a hazard.<br /><br />~CONCLUSION~<br />Overall I am very pleased with this toy.  It is definitely one of the better values and interesting toys we have purchased.
B003UYUR10|2.0|I had already seen Prince of Persia before buying the blu-ray/DVD/Digital version through a 3rd party Amazon seller. The movie appealed to me enough that I (a recovering pack-rat and gadget/media hoarder) wanted a copy. Item was delivered early and exactly in the condition as described, so I have no issues with the seller I got the movie from.<br /><br />What really disappointed me was after I opened the item packaging and tried out the blu-ray and digital discs. I can't get the digital copy to work. Blu-ray disc seems to have a poor quality play-back, not like other blu-ray discs I have viewed.<br /><br />The digital discs comes with a Disney Digital activation code that can only be used once. Fine, I figured, and ran the auto-play feature to use that code so I could copy a digital file to my computer. You get a choice of either transferring via iTunes or Windows Media Player (not both). Chose the Windows Media Player (WMP) option, it prompted me to update my WMP security, so fine, I did that with no problems. After the disc tells me transfer is complete, I go to my folder and try to run the movie file with WMP and it gives me an error. Tried several times.<br /><br />Emailed Disney Digital support, and they came back with a reply to go ask my audio or video card manufacturer instead.<br /><br />Long story short, I would have never bought this 3-disc edition if I had known the digital copy doesn't work. I would have been happy owning a digital copy through VUDU or something.<br /><br />I will update if I ever get the digital copy working. Otherwise, do not buy this 3-disc version.
B004BSFC46|4.0|~BACKGROUND~<br />I purchased the same ones, but different colors and part of a set - [[ASIN:B000I2Q0C2 Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle & Foot Finder Set]] for my 2 month old son to use in aiding his motor skill development.<br /><br />~PROS~<br />- Cute and colorful eye catching designs.<br />- Wrist rattles can be used for more than just the wrist - they can be attached to carriers, playpads, etc.<br />- Works as a chewing toy.<br /><br />~CONS~<br />- The wrist rattle cuffs are a bit on the small side.<br /><br />~CONCLUSION~<br />Similar to other reviews on Amazon regarding the Lamaze wrist and foot rattles,  my son does not really pay attention to any of rattles. This is strange because he loved looking at and touching similar looking toys. But he does enjoy chewing on the wrist rattles - I just wash them every few days.<br /><br />Definitely stay away from the [[ASIN:B004BSFC6Y Lamaze High Contrast Foot Finders]] as they are designed very poorly.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|This thing keeps my pc air cooled. works like suppose to. Be sure you get the right cooler for your CPU/ Processor. The Higher the CPU Wattage the Cooler you have to keep it. Air cooling is alternative to water cooled. High AIR Flow is best with a LARGE ful size and Mid siz case.
B004BSFC6Y|1.0|~BACKGROUND~<br />I purchased the set that includes these foot rattles, but in different colors - [[ASIN:B000I2Q0C2 Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle & Foot Finder Set]] for my 2 month old son to use in aiding his motor skill development.<br /><br />~PROS~<br />- Cute and colorful eye catching designs.<br /><br />~CONS~<br />- Foot rattles are hard to put on initially and then remain stretched out and too big.<br />- Foot rattles are not designed like a sock with a curve to them. The are merely tubes of fabric. Perhaps this contributes to why they do not stay on very well?<br />- Foot rattles keep coming off. There is minimal elasticity in the socks and they keep sliding down. Even over socks they just keep sliding down. When my son starts moving his feet around the rattles are hanging off or just come off altogether.<br />- Rattles are a bit too quiet.<br />- The foot rattles are a bit on the large side.<br /><br />~CONCLUSION~<br />I think the it is a great concept, but definitely could be executed better.<br /><br />Unfortunately, my son does not really pay attention to any of rattles. This is strange because he loves looking at and touching similar looking toys.<br /><br />I would not recommend these and would recommend spending your money on something else.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|Considering that this didn't do that well at the box office I was stunned at just how great this movie was.  I am a very harsh critic of movies and I am rarely impressed with them, but this one was very well done, had consistent action throughout, and was steadily engaging throughout.  Just the right amount of sparkly slo-mo death.  You'll see.
B003ZZAXFO|4.0|This album placed on the world stage an has so many classic tracks that I cannot select one as a favourite. The quality and detail in his music never ceases to amaze , especially when revisiting after all this time. Recommended for any one wanting to try some Peter Gabriel for the first time.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Enjoyed every minute of the suspense.  Watching the relationships grow/change is interesting; the desperation of no hope for the future followed by the characters pulling together to survive is enlightening.
B002PL8SWY|5.0|You cannot surpass this for a live album , the best of the Stones era and carries so much of the atmosphere in the recording . The vinyl seems to produce so much more quality in the live sound . I have been a fan since the 70's of this album and I cannot stop playing it now . I now have a new fan in my 16 year old son . If you like live recordings then this is at the pinnacle.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I'm a casual gamer, so World of Warcraft-style games don't have much appeal for me. This game has a great little story line, wonderful sound and graphics, and is totally absorbing. I'm the kind of person that likes Scramble, Bejeweled, Angry Birds, Mahjongg, so that gives you a sense of what appeals to me. This game has absorbed me for many more hours than I like to admit, and is currently my favorite. I got it as a FAOTD, but knowing it now, I would happily pay for it. Kudos to the developers.
B007IJK8XU|4.0|Great to revisit this classic album , loved it then and even more now.Classic beginnings of heavy metal. Long live vinyl
B008CPZNL6|5.0|I'm a news junkie. I used to have BBC, AP, etc. Flipboard pulled all those into a very attractive format and groups the different feeds well. I'm as well-informed (or more) than before; using a single app cuts the battery usage, and I'm getting the same news in shorter time. I've deleted the other news apps as unnecessary now. Highly recommended. The newest revision really takes advantage of my tablet's larger screen. Running it on a Galaxy Note 2 and an Acer A500.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|This was a gift for my Aunt. She really loves the series and she was more then happy to receive this.
B009LK6JS2|3.0|I played with it for awhile, and it's OK. It's not physics-based, so no stalling, etc. The landings are fun and absorbing, but after a few of them, I tired of the game.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|The story is allegorical in nature and it complements the theme such as 'transcendental unity of religions'. The part where Pi is compared to the tiger Richard Parker may be alluding to the fact that through the suffering of hunger starvation and isolation at sea it enabled Pi's nafs ( the tiger ) to slowly die ( Die before you die ) until he reach nirvana at the sea shore and gain wisdom.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|we just love to play thiis game, kids even sit for long time playing try to see who can beat
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a fun game once I got the hang of it. Looks great on my 8.9\\" Kindle Fire. It's probably intended for a younger crowd, but fun just the same.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Here in the boonies, satellite TV is just way too costly; so, I have to wait to view series when they are released to DVD. The wait is worth it for this second season of The Walking Dead. I love these characters, and the makeup artists for the &#34;walkers&#34; need to be nominated for awards. I can hardly wait for the release of the third season and already have it preordered.
B0041QSZJM|5.0|I gave this CD 5 stars on the simple fact that China Forbes covers these holiday classics to perfection. There is not a lot of extra &#34;personal interpretation&#34;. Pink Martini has a unique sound in today's world. True talent from everybody on their CD.Anybody who wants to add something to their music collection ,but NOT main stream noise , should consider this CD , or anything from Pink Martini.
B0072OFM28|4.0|Some of you may disagree, but I believe the second season of the Spartacus series is not as great as the first season. Liam, though buff and energetic, is just not Andy. The scene stealers this season are Lucy Lawless as Lucretia and the actress who portrays Glaber's wife.
B009A87ZQU|4.0|I saw this movie in the theater. It is a great Bond movie, no doubt. However, this page advertises that the movie in this combo-pack is WIDESCREEN. I just opened the packaging. The BluRay probably is widescreen, but the DVD is labelled FULL SCREEN. I have a BluRay player, so I will probably give away the DVD without verifying the format, but since it is labelled FULL SCREEN, it likely IS full screen. If not for this, I would have rated it 5-stars. If you are someone like me who really does care about seeing the full wide screen instead of pan-and-scan full screen, you might want to think twice about buying this.
0783225733|5.0|Definitely one of Tom Hanks best movies ever. It's definitely worth re-watching. Also makes a good Christmas gift for anyone who loves historical dramas.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Does what it says and even more. Very good app. Keyboard sometimes is cumbersome, but that could just be a result of my rooted device. Other than that, this app works great.
1423136802|5.0|This item was picked out by our grand daughter for a gift. She loves to read and this was her choice. It was priced fairly priced and arrived on time for xmas.. It comes nicely packaged .
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Really Great and Useful App. Does all it says it does. I especially like how it tracks usage. Awesome App.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I would highly recommend watching this series. We love watching these after we get the kids down to bed. I give this a 4 out of 5 becuase as much as I love this series I don't see myself watching them over again.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This is my game. All of the TeamLava games are on point. They are entertaining and ever changing which keeps them new and exciting.
0786962984|4.0|Dungeon! is a classic game that I played when I was a boy, it's very easy to learn and play. My daughter age 8 didn't have any problems learning within a few rounds. The game take around 30-40 mins to finish, and it's a good introduction to these type of board games for your children.  You basically pick a character ranging from a fighter, rogue, mage & cleric, each class has an amount of gold needed to win the game, so the rogue needs 10,000 gold but is fairly weak so it would be hard for him to fight higher level monsters which drop better gold, unlike the mage who needs 30,000 gold to win the game but it better at fighting higher level monsters. You move around the board going into rooms beating the monster to gain gold until you meet the gold requirement then you can leave the dungeon to win. This is a very simple and straight forward game. I would suggest ages 5-12 would love this game.
B008OOYALE|1.0|I am a big fan of TeamLava, but not this game. Dragons are not my thing, so I deleted this one right after they gave me the free gems for downloading it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I enjoy having everything I need in one small package. With Kindle  on my Android tablet which also includes my financials and personal information.
B0070YDOT8|1.0|Crashes and does not work at all on my rooted pandigital. Too bad too, because I really enjoy playing Big Fish on my computer.
B000085RPU|2.0|Not really sure how the whole region thing works, or which region I live in. It's obviously not region 2, because this disc, although in great condition, refuses to play in any dvd player around. Will be returning it if possible. Shipping time was excellent though, it arrived two weeks ahead of the expected arrival date.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|This is a wonderful album. If you liked Phillip Phillips on American Idol, you'll love this album. All the songs are pleasing to listen to. Buy and enjoy!
B00081U7HC|5.0|I purchased 4 DVDs in the order, they came packaged together and were received in excellant condition. Since they were gifts it's always a concern.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The second installment of any series can seem like filler information until the big finale; however, Catching Fire is simply riveting.
B007UXSPK2|4.0|Not bad for the MI series. I think I like the previous one better. Seemed to be more climactic as compared to this flick. Definitely like Jeremy Renner and the dude from Shaun of the Dead. Thought the woman in the group was average.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the series when it first aired; hence my purchase of the DVD set!  Nicely packaged, with tons of excellent extras.  Well worth the cost -- which was not much, when you think about it!
B005EHQGTS|1.0|This app uses only about half of available space on the 8.9 tablet and is imposable to use as advertised without a magnifying glass which was not supplied. There is no way to zoom in on the display or use the whole area of the 8.9 tablet. If they redesigned the app to use the complete display it might be usable. As it is, it is a toy and unusable.<br /><br />I have used other remote desktop programs on other computers and they worked well. Without changes to the software, I could not recommend this to anyone.<br /><br />Because of the short fall, I would give it a zero star but that is not an option.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I have used this app several times to help my baby fall asleep or stay asleep during the difficult nights.  I love that you can combine the different sound tracks to create the exact music/white noise effect you need for different situations!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|but I don't read Sci-Fi and this felt like that to me in the beginning. Once I got past the first couple of chapters (which I struggled through)...oh boy. I was hooked line and sinker! Tore through all three....
B00280LYIC|5.0|It was a really good book. I would read it again if I wasn't reading the series. I would tell anyone to read it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|As my other feedback stated, had to read them all RIGHT NOW! I made sure I had them lined up and ready after being surprised by the Hunger Games.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|The first time I watched it, there were things I didn't notice, and it made me feel a little strange afterwards.  The second time I watched it, it made much more sense.  A fun movie.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Very descriptive yet mindful of &#34;too much information&#34;.  It was written well for someone like me who has the interest of the subject but not knowing military terminology that well. Quite a story...emotions are there.
B000001GX5|4.0|I love Respighi's music on this CD - the Pines of  Rome & the Fountains of Rome. A beautiful, evocative and powerful modern take on  classical music, my only problem with this CD is the inclusion of some true \\"Classical\\" pieces on the same disc. I suppose it is an interesting study to hear the similarities between Resphigi and Boccarini but I would rather have more Resphigi included since I much prefer his modern sound - I suppose the editor assumes if I like Respihgi I must like old music too? If I want to do a study of musical comparisons I would rather borrow the old masters from the library and then decide if I would like to buy the same. Still, no regrets on getting the \\"Pines & Fountains\\" - a must-have!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|but had to keep going just to see where it went. It was good as far as making your imagination work.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is probably one of the best books I have ever read. It is one of those books that you just want to read right after you finish because it is so good.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|with the &#34;way his pants hung on his hips just so&#34; and other lines but it certainly woke up some housewives apparently!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|couldnt put it down, witty sexy a must read along with the two other books in trilogy a yes yes yes give me a christain gray
B003O86FMW|5.0|I said I wouldn't read the series but after getting into the first book, I was hooked!! Had to read all 3 in voracious succession
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Perfectly sized and sharpens well.  Works well on both flat and serrated blades, Sharing this with the team on deployment to ensure all of our knives stay sharp
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was absolutely fantastic with lots of surprises.  It was one of those books you did not want to end.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This boxed set of Downton Abbey is most enjoyable.  The setting, characters, and plot is so engaging, one counts the days for season three and four to come.
1579129129|4.0|Skulls by Simon Winchester is  a gorgeous book. I love the informative sections on the culture and history of skulls, but I'm a bit disappointed with the photos of the collection. I'm not asking that they be life size, only that there be measurements so that we know what we are looking at. For example, the tiny skeleton of a sea horse fill an entire page of this coffee-table sized book, with no size reference whatsoever. On the other hand, for those of us interested in skulls, the book is fascinating. I was particularly interested in the bird skulls (again, no size reference) and how the beak or bill related to the rest of the skull. I found the fish skulls other-worldly and pretty creepy, and something you don't get to see very often. I don't think this book can be used as a reference for someone collecting skulls, but for someone just interested in looking at them, it's a treat.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|This is an easy read that will inspire one to take on the world.  I think it is great fodder for anyone looking to start their own business, or need a pick-me-up.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|The movie was excellent for a spoof on monster movies.  So, if you aren't a fan of monster movies I can see you would not understand the humor. Otherwise, it it very funny!
B0026HKO2E|3.0|I love the look of the movie.  But the scene with Mr. Smith was a bit too long for my taste making it very boring.
B00A9X9ORI|1.0|I'm a geek, true, but let me attempt to put myself on the continuum.  I think I can name 3-5 people from star trek, and couldn't name that many from Star Wars.  Honestly I don't give a big flip about either of them, but would gladly watch them again and again on basic cable despite their insane number of commercial breaks.  I enjoy a good sci-fi no matter how low budget, from Godzilla to Moon - to me it's all about a good story.<br /><br />I regularly enjoy a good sci-fi movie and had high hopes for Looper.  Sadly it was just terrible.  There are more plot holes in this movie than swiss cheese.<br /><br />Without giving away some spoilers, Looper suffers from a truckload of problems.  It attempts to be part thriller, part sci-fi, and succeeds only at being part piece of crap.  When they trot out the strippers you know the movie is grasping at straws.  With extremely few exceptions strippers are the halmark of the director knowing they're running low on ideas to keep butts in seats.  The movie attempts to throw so much at the viewer only to leave them all open as loose ends.  For instance he's heavily addicted to drugs, but his recovery is some sweating, a good puke, and then he's good to go.  No convulsions or montage of recovery here.<br /><br />Story is just not important here.  And the rare instance it is, they screw it up.  Every twist is forecast, every side story left underdeveloped, and every character left shallow and unmemorable.<br /><br />And then there's the coup de grace.  One of the main characters chops at a stump with an axe. All. Movie. Long.  They were clearly out of ideas at this point and just couldn't afford some extra CGI to wrap things up nicely.  My two cent is to definitely skip looper and go watch a good movie.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Good story, can't put it down, except for that the book took too long for the amount of story that was it it
B008HK3XU4|5.0|love it! didn't know how well it would work since  I got it on sale but it works really well... mainly got it bc of the color.
B009PK9SB8|4.0|The camera and BacPac arrived promptly.  Was unable to log onto GoPro for the required software upgrade for over a day. Once on the upgrade download went just fine until the last step where, as a non-nerd, I was stuck. The directions may have crystal clear for someone with more technical background and experience but not for me so I resigned myself to waiting for my son to visit and do the deed.<br />On a later try to upgrade the procedure had gone from download and pray to plug and play, that I could do.<br />The memory card recommended by Amazon had a minor problem- it was the WRONG size for the camera which requires a micro size unit. NewEgg was able to provide the right card in short order and now all is well with the GoPro world. Any future recommendations by Amazon for the &#34;also bought&#34;, &#34;go with&#34; items will be treated with great distrust and suspicion.
B002CW4K7S|5.0|My 27 y.o. son was thrilled when he opened this on Christmas morning.  And since then he says he has played it a ton and LOVE it!
B005HSG3TC|3.0|No, it won't kill them and if your pet is eating your Kindle you probably weren't properly supervising or need a behaviorist,the problem with this case is the felty liner.  It is a magnet for pet hair.  And because it is a closed loop kind of felt neither a pet hair roller nor those 3M pet hair grabber velcro like things are able to remove the hair.  If you are only ever using your tablet in your own home alone then I guess it's ok, but trying to go in public with this repulsive hair covered thing is embarrassing.  And I'm a clean person and clean after the pets regularly but I like to read in bed or on the sofa and the dogs are usually there with me and every time I hair gets onto this felt it is basically there forever.  I managed with the tweezer and a lint roller and the 3M velcro sheets to get about 80% of the hair off of it, but seriously who has time to do that constantly.  I wish I had known this when I bought this case.  I would have probably bought a different case.  Also, it only holds it horizontal.  Some of my brain game app's only run upright.  That is kind of annoying too.
B006AX6ONI|2.0|You get the impression that someone approached Cuban about how he could make money off this book without no effort, and he just greenlit the project. It is full of cliches and very forgettable.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|i love how it saves everything to cloud! I used inkpad notepad before and lost all of my notes when a virus hit my kindle... but not with evernote!
0670023329|5.0|A good price for a Christmas gift. It cost quite a bit more in our local bookstore and they were out of it anyway and had to order it!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I rate this book five stars because it's funny and it's recommend for all families it's one of the best books I've ever read!  I hope you read and enjoy it!
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Didn't care about the end... too much of bla bla for nothing! maybe next book will be better than this... second book the best
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The overall setting of Downton is spectacular. The costumes are beautiful, the drama  is not drawn out, its extremely gratifying to have things go your way instead of moaning in frustration. I love the servants end of the story more than the Crawley family. Most of them are so likeable (most but not all) I am so glad to have found this and I yearn for more!!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I really liked this story and I can't wait to watch the movie. It is very intense, so read only if you can handle a complicated harsh story.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Beautiful presentation in one case with a nice diagramation.<br />Intuitives menus with easy system.<br />I love this bluray from a surrealistic series.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I love Tom Clancy but this one was a little drawn out and far fetched. It was still an interesting read.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This movie can make me feel great even though when I feeling down or upset.  A lot of stories and good ending, wish they can bring back Agent Coulson on the next movie.
0393327345|5.0|I picked up this little gem a friend recommended it (along with MASH and American Psycho). I must admit, I'm not an avid reader, but I try. Well, two days later I was done, and I had experienced greatness. Yes, the movie is one of my all-time favorites, but the book puts you in the mind of the narrator. You can't help but go a little crazy as you think the way he thinks. A quick read, an enjoyable read, and a book that refuses to let go of your brain, from start to finish. Enjoy.
067144901X|5.0|Afer reading previous reviews on this book, I couldn't wait for it to arrive and read it to my Grandaughter....she loves to r make all the animal sounds while I'm reading the book.  Great book for 8 months and up!
B008OOYALE|5.0|A lot of people say that it takes money for this game. It doesn't. You just need to be patient but if you don't have the patience, this game isn't for you
B007712XAU|5.0|My niece had not watched the first two series of Dowton Abbey so I had to &#34;catch her up&#34; .  She is now ready, as we all are, for season 3.  Now she knows the characters and is &#34;hooked&#34;.
B004MMFBQU|3.0|After deciphering the awkwardly diagramed instruction manual, the pieces did not quite fit together properly and we had to do some tweaking. The 2 front doors still do not close correctly and the shelf inside is warped. Toddler is loving it, though, so I guess that's the important part.  I don't think it's worth $99. Maybe $49.  I also can't rate its durability because I just put it together, but I have a feeling it won't be great.  Also, the age suggestions are inaccurate.  This is a small and limiting kitchen, suitable for a 2-4 year old.  I cannot imagine an 8 year old getting anything out of it.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Great app works great and the info is right on target. It's. easy to read. and all the info you could possibly. need is there! !
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This was a gift for my daughter. She has watched over and over since she got and she loves it. Dr. Seuss movies are some of the best children's movies available.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|Great CD. My favorite song was O Come, O Come Emmanuel. It sort of has that same ethereal feel as her Lord of the Rings songs.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was a really good book. will start reading the other ones soon can't wait to find out how it ends.
B000JCSBU0|5.0|Must see movie. Beautifully raw, disturbing insight into addiction. The four main characters are skillfully rendered, the depth of their persona emerging as the movie steadily picks up pace to the inevitable spiraling finale.
B0065GC0BA|4.0|I was surprised by this book having come across it in a rather round about way. It is enjoyable and well-written and beautifully, unsentimentally sad.
1400031001|3.0|Boyd's novel is in the form of a journal kept by a minor English writer and art collector, Montstuart, and as such includes both engaging scenes with reflections and dead-end experiences and minor details that fail to add to the reader's interest in the journal keeper and his world. Spanning every decade of the twentieth century, Montstuart's long life stretches credulity given his round-the-clock alcoholism and often desulatory life. Near the end of this life, he reflects on its richness; for this reader it was a life of constant sensory explorations without any moral compass. Perhaps his alcoholism prevented him from feeling strong emotion or making thoughtful judgments most of the time, including when his son dies, which hardly registers with him at all,and the times he cheats on his wives without regret.<br /><br />The philosophical position reiterated several times throughout the novel is that life consists of a series of accidental encounters - chance happenings that add up to both the good and the bad, with little pattern to any of it. And so I suppose we should judge the novel accordingly: it comprises a series of events of random occurrence that often have little relationship to one another and,in the end, do not suggest any meaningful sense of a purposeful life for the keeper of the journal, Montstuart's ruminations at the end notwithstanding. If our lives are like this, then why expect a novel about the life of one of us to add up to more?
B0052CK5PQ|5.0|I read the s*** out of this book and will read the s*** out of it again and again. How to be a Woman is funny and clever and timeous and necessary. The very best kind of book!
B00AKEMHCA|3.0|Update 10/6/2014:  After going back to this game and playing a decent 5 - 6 hours more, I found that some of my initial complaints were not entirely valid. However, some other problems kept persisting that definitely needed attention! So in essence, I still feel this game deserves the same review, but I'll go over my initial dislikes and see how they hold up:    1) \\"the balance of the game is seriously bad! there is no true way to tell what types of balloons will arrive at what times, so it's tough to plan out your strategy in advance. also, there are so little balloons in the start that it's only bearable to play until around level 25 with the fast forward activated. also, when you move to level 50+, the balance becomes WAY too hard for some reason. it doesnt warn you at all, it just throws a ton of balloons your way and the only way to win is with fast firing towers, not at all good.\\"       Update: Well, yes and no. The game IS unbalanced, but not for these reasons. On the contrary, you know EXACTLY what's going to happen, rather than not at all, which I got completely wrong! The game also gives you lots of fore-warning on the initial difficulty spikes about to come! However, let me list some of the other issues I had with the balance:       * One of the units, I believe it was the Minigun that you unlock later that is manually controlled, is absolutely overpowered! It can be upgraded to destroy any balloon with any stat boost, and doesn't care for camos because it NEVER stops firing! I can point every gun on the screen at one point and it will do all the work for me. It doesn't matter that they are manual, because you don't require any input to actually use them. They are actually so powerful, that near the 100th or so round, I didn't use a SINGLE Super Monkey, and only used those manual turrets. Super broken weapon!     * Because the rounds tell you exactly what is coming up when, it becomes routine and very stale. Each round has a specific text coming up on thebottom of the screen before the round begins, which never changes. Which balloons come at what times never changes. And the strategy to defeat each round, once you find it, never changes. This, in turn, makes the progression of the game become a snorefest, and takes away from the pleasure of beating the game! One of my favorite Tower Defense Games, Chalkboard Defense, has it to where you build your own maze, and figure out a strategy that is most effective based on the type of enemies and level in which you are at in the game. Here, since all the maps and routines are all laid out for you, it's all about finding that one killer strategy that always works, which is never fun. Plus, this is far easier to do with the OP turret mentioned in the beginning of this response.     * Some of the later levels feel genuinely impossible to beat without some of the support classes that cost REAL money for expendable resources that you can never use again! It kind of shocks me that the game nearly requires you to pay more money in order to win at a game that ALREADY costs money to begin with! If the balancing was more fair, I'd pass it off as an option; but it doesn't sit well with me knowing that over an hour of work per 50 or so rounds is wasted if I loose because I couldn't afford to buy some of those support classes that cost those ridiculous amounts of in-game currency! Definitely feels like a sham to me.     2) \\"the music is not very catchy and extremely repetitive. While there is a decent level by level amount of songs, they are no less boring and repetitive. you can always shut off the music and play your own, but it's just worth noting.\\"       * While the music IS catchy, it's not very pleasant hearing for over an hour straight! Not a major complaint like I thought it was, but I still recommend having some music stored on your phone playing rather than the initial soundtrack.     3) \\"you won't receive a single penny from playing any round unless you go past a certain amount of stages on a certain level. it's never detailed how many levels you need in order to earn that said profit, it's kinda ridiculous you dont get a single dime for loosing earlier than they want you too.\\"       * I wish this wasn't true, but it is. You don't get jack-diddly squat for playing any of the levels if you don't beat them! Each level can take up to an hour, so it feels so wasted knowing that if you loose, you get NOTHING or so close to nothing that it wasn't even worth the endeavor! It's frustrating and down right boring! It genuinely feels like a grind just because of this faulty mechanic.    On the plus side, the graphics look very crisp and clean. the art style is very poppy and enjoyable to look at, while the sound effects don't annoy you very much. the amount of towers and how each one affects game play is very unique to any other TD game I've played, but it still doesn't fix the balance issues. overall, great for children, but frustrating for any TD veteran out there.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The book amazing just as I thought it couldn't get better I reccomemed it to all the people who love Suzanne Collin s
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I have owned the original 5600 and the Astro3 and unfortunately had one stolen, the other lost.  This is the perfect size to be able to keep track of, yet still delivers a FAST charge (or 6 without recharging Astro).  This comes with Apple and many other adapters to be able to charge just about any device.  The description is 100% accurate with the instruction manual, so if you see your device listed, then it will charge it.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|The Dark Night Rises  In my opinion one of the best in the series. Hopeing for continuing story. Thanks for the entertainment
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is one of the best books I have ever read. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves action and adventure stories.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|I love this show. It feels more realistic than most sci-fi's, with no sound occurring in space, and no warp drives. The characters are incredible. My wife doesn't like Sci-fi, but watched a few episodes when we were dating ('cause... you know... we were dating!), and that got her hooked on the characters. We're bummed that the show got canceled...<br /><br />If you've seen Serenity, the show is way better. You get to see mor of what the characters are really like.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|I've like most all the Pixar stuff. Watching the trailor on Brave I knew it would be good and I was right. Awesome CGI, good story...funny.
B00A4YVHXQ|2.0|I thought it would be a little more fun. The music stops until you hit the right key, so it never even sounds good while you're playing.
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|I purchased the series because all the gals at work were raving about it.  The books are sooo good.  Looking forward to the movie!!
B009MCRHH6|3.0|It looks like a puzzle game or engineering game, but plays like an action game, where speed and luck play into whether or not your tower collapses and you have to restart. The puzzle part isn't very hard to figure out, it's just a matter of building it fast enough so that it doesn't start swaying in the breeze (which it will do regardless of how wide you make it), and still being accurate enough to make a decent tower.
0425252868|5.0|I got this for my FIL for Christmas after my FIL was telling me about an article he read in our local Sunday paper about it.  My FIL had to tell me twice, once when he just started reading it and then again when he finished it, about how great it was and how he enjoyed reading it!

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Don't get me wrong, I love a good love story, but this book I  so much more. It has unexpected turns and a lot of depth. Great job, so different from Slammed and Point of Retreat. I'm still a fan.
B0097EWK3A|2.0|It wouldn't let me download the full version to my kindle after I bought so I only got to play the free version which only lets you get to a certain point which is why I'm giving this such a low rating. That really needs to be fixed! Really!

B0063GORYU|4.0|The game is fun but addicting. I love the fact that there are not ads between every game.  Have fun!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Keeps us guessing until the last page. Not you're classic love story but an amazing love story. A look into a subject that isn't written about often:suicide. Definitely recommend this book.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I wasn't tremendously attracted to the title or the cover of this book, but I read the reviews and decided to take a chance. I am sooooo glad I did! It was really great, definitely worth buying. One of those books that you can't put down and can't stop thinking about when you're not reading it. Great characters and plot that keep you guessing. Well written too.

All in all, I am very pleased with this Explorer.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|this series is one of my favorites. i have read all the books and this the best so far. So buy it now!!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a great book that I would highly recommend.  I will read more books by Hugh Howey and can't wait to see what happens in silo 17.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Touching, simple, reflexive, emotive. Perfect for a young reader or a grown up one. First book I read on kindle, I couldn't have started better.
0765325950|5.0|Sour grapes from some regarding the ebook not withstanding, A Memory of Light is a superb end to the Wheel of Time. Much as with life, not everyone will get everything they want. But we do get Jordan's mythical &#34;final scene&#34;, finally. That alone is worth the price.
B007HGPBRC|5.0|It is so good to have something more from Mr. Hitchens.  It is also helpful to those who have serious illnesses.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|If you like Seth MacFarlane, you'll love this movie. The cursing Teddy bear is hilarious for the first hour but starts to get a little old after awhile. Thankfully, the movie ends just before you get tired of the jokes. I'd recommend this for a good laugh, but I really hope they don't do a sequel ... they used up all the good gags.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Andy Weir has done a wonderful job writing this gripping story of a stranded astronaut.  The story made me laugh often, but I was also riveted and could not stop reading.  Mr. weir's writing is excellent and the story is clever -- also, the science seemed credible. Loved this book.  Loved the ending, but wish the adventure wasn't over.  Please write more books, Mr. Weir!
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|With a little help my niece who is almost 3 can play this game and loves it. Feeding and playing w the animals. I enjoy myself. Haha
B000FA5TTW|4.0|Sometimes there were sentences that seemed to be references to things I wasn't clear about. The characters would say elusive hints that I didn't get. Interesting story and characters though good read.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Very entertaining, thought provoking and yet humorous. I laughed and cried my way through this lovely book that tackles a difficult subject with incredible grace.
B0050PYNP8|4.0|The DVD arrives as said and on time with no damage.  I enjoyed the movie and had to have it in my movie collection
1451695195|5.0|This book was excellent and I really enjoyed reading it twice!!! I am sharing this book with my friends and<br />family!!
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|The DVD arrived as stated and in excellent shape.  I really like science fiction movies and I had to have this for my collection.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it is free and entertaining for a while so worth the time.  just gets monotonous after the first page of games.
1609611543|5.0|NOT ONLY GOT IT, I AM FOLLOWING IT AND SO FAR MY HUSBAND LIKES THE THINGS I HAVE MADE.  I SAW THE DR. ON TV AND AFTER READING THE BOOK, KNOW HE IS TELLING THE TRUTH.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I thought the second book of the Hunger GAMES , Catching FIRE was very good.  It held my interest  from the first page to the last .
0446554995|4.0|I love Preston and Child's books, and this is no exception. I must confess that I am still in the thick of it. What I can say is that it involves Nazi genetic secrets, the return of Agent Pendergast's long dead wife, people running scared, Pendergast almost taking his own life, genetic doubles,  people who mysteriously live beyond their normal life span and more. One main character even becomes a father! I like the fact that several of the regular characters return to help each other out. Is this another nail biter? You betcha!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I like the Flow Free game.  It operates well on Kindle Fire HD.  The game solutions make me have to concentrate in a really good way.
0007466064|4.0|A little more exciting than the previous. Got the pages turning faster. Seems a waste of page turning just to have Jon Snow killed(Sorry). But then I thought Arya was on her last legs a couple of books ago. Lets hope Jon is a warg. I enjoyed the character.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Very hard to give a review on this one. I really connected or felt connected with the characters. This is a great book and I highly recommend it!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This  book was so informative that I couldn't believe it. I got the book free on my Kindle and because it was free, I thought that it would be a bunk bok or something. Instead, it was a great tool for me.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Started off as a great relationship...then marriage...then...Twisted. Jealousy. Marriage. Then she is gone. READ it. This was recomened to me to read and I so WAS NOT interested...I was way wrong. Gone Girl blew my mind! What a great book.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book is what have started me reading Rick Riordan's books; the Percy Jackson series and the Kane's series. Rick Riordan writes his stories in where you can actually picture it  in your mind. It is just like watching a movie without seeing but making your mind plow into the stories.  It is very interesting. I do love it.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This app was good every where I went it was there and it open up fast I like it<br />:)))
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Great movie with a great message.  I have 4 daughters who say this is their favorite movie...that says a lot!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have this all on my MacBook, PC laptop, iPhone, iPad, and Kindle Fire. Write a note once and you've got it on all devices. Easy to organize your notes into notebooks. Elegantly simple.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|I couldn't put this down, it was thought provoking, riveting and a real page turner.  Stayed up very late finishing it up at the end and found myself wishing for more when it was over.  Another wonderful story from Jodi Picoult.
0634089358|4.0|I started playing my Fender Jazz bass 4 months ago, and also started listening to blues.<br />I picked up this book to give my practicing with the Hal Leonard Beginner Bass book a little variety. I also take lessons once a week. First, this book is exactly what I need. Without any appreciation for the styles (shuffle, rhumba, boogie...) or the keys, it was time consuming and frustrating to pick out the base line of songs I listen to. After learning a few of the songs in this book, I am faster at picking up the bass lines using the intro, turn arounds and progressions in this book.  Also, the skill level in the book is accessible to most bass players. I've been playing for about 3 months and have learned (as in don't have to look at the music) about half the songs in the last month. The ones I can't play require a finger spread of 4 frets (like 3 to 6 in tab talk). But, I will get them! This book makes me want to play and to get better -  so it's good in my book ... shelf.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I look forward to watching the big bang theory when ever it's on. I can even handle a rerun if I haven't seen it more than about 5 times. Raj, is a grate character, and I'm constantly amazed at the &#34;in character&#34; (as well as creative and consistent) wardrobe selections made for Howard, and Sheldon.<br /><br />Some times Penny's character kind of wears me out. I find her and Lenard's on a gain off again attraction getting kind of hackneyed.<br /><br />With all this said, I'll still have to say that this is one of my favorite shows and I look forward to watching it every time it comes on.
B003QP4BJM|5.0|The author makes a compelling, erudite and compelling argument for an exciting future for the human race. At a time when doom and gloom is so fashionable, this is so refreshing.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe Haven<br />Very much a Sparks book once started you can't put it down, the characters are so real, and the plot so realistic you forget it is fiction, and your feeling's about the characters are defined.  Wonderful, fantastic book.  I will be afraid the movie won't eve come close to the book.  Must read.
B002ECJZ76|5.0|Very uplifting. I watched it twice the first night it arrived.It is the kind of movie that Hallmark would like to make.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Read this book in two days, absolutely a must read. I laughed and cried. I felt every emotion of both characters. Love it.
1881273628|3.0|The idea is good and worth exploring but I don't this book satisfied what I was looking for. The author writes well, but after reading I felt that I could have absorbed the same information after reading a 3-4 page summery and a quarter of the time it took me to read this book. I have spoken to people that have read it and they say it helped but I didn't really get an &#34;a-ha&#34; moment during or after reading.
0765325950|1.0|How do I get this book onto my Kindle? It won't fit into the DVD tray of my computer, let alone the USB port of my Kindle? Should I get my nephew to undo the screws on the case and put it on the hard drive? Wouldn't it be easier if it was an ebook? It's not doing me any good as an object.
B009RI4FRU|3.0|Wes Anderson movies are like eating only cake for dinner. The first piece is delightful. The second piece is good. The third piece is really just too much. By the final piece you think &#34;now why did I like that first piece so much?&#34;
B005KELW26|4.0|keeps it safe and cleaner. one issue : magnetic closer seems to be losing strength.five more words huh, it's alright.
B004H1V5RU|4.0|This is our second Perplexus. The first one has been such a success we had to get another. Both are used by adults as well as children. They have been dropped a number of times on hard wood floors with nothing breaking. The Perplexus Epic is quite a bit harder then the Perplexus Original.
0071752854|5.0|If you have a business and want to close more deals for bigger amounts, this is the book for you.  My closing percentage was down.  My coach recommended this book. I read it and closed an additional 12,000  more in sales in a matter of 2 weeks.  Best investment I have made in years. I recommend it highly. In fact, I'm going to read it again.
B004SIP8OI|5.0|Great action scenes, unforgettable soundtrack, memorable characters, a neat photography. There isn't one single thing I would complain about Kill Bill.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|its a great read just like the tv, plenty of blood and guts.find out for yourself. thats if you like this sort of book
B0051GOB26|5.0|I have always loved this movie but when I opened this blu-ray edition I was really amazed. Great way to honor this film!
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I am a long time fan of Green Arrow. The CW has taken a classic character a treated the storyline with respect and put some AWSOME twists in the stories. I enjoyed Smallvilles G.A. However, Arrow's version is stronger in some ways. I anticipate this show will go nowhere but up in the future.<br />Keep up the good work CW, cast and crew!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a pretty cool app cause you can keep getting more and more games that you can play over and over again!  it is awesome!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas sparks does it again. I've never been in so many directions from a book and loved every moment. What an incredible journey!
B006LSZECO|2.0|Addictive read but once you reach the end you can't believe it's just OVER. If you like closure this book isn't for you.
0930289528|5.0|Thought Not the best edition of the book, its nice just having it.<br />The pages are not glossy like a paper pastic mix but are more like a newspaper texture.<br />Pages will rip and will stain if handled clumsily. But we dont care about that!<br />V is V!!<br />Nothing Else matters!!!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Somewhat predictable story line but a very easy read with fair dose of humour.  Likable characters and to me the author giving the reader some insight into their backgrounds, added to their characters.  I enjoyed it. Good story for the price.
B0048KXRR6|5.0|Just as funny and entertaining as the first Nanny McPhee Movie. I enjoyed it and would reccomend it as a great family flick.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Works wonderfully on my iPod Touch (through Generations 2 through 4).  Settings for background and font size which is great for my aging eyes.  Almost endless selections of great reads from Amazon.  Once the book is downloaded to the iPod Touch, it can be read anytime and anywhere.  This is probably my favorite app as I love to read.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Exciting.  Best if the batman series. Would recommend to people who like superhero movies.  Blue ray is a good version
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|Got this one for $1.49 and is so worth it, there are so many levels and different restaurants you can keep going for ages.  truly a lot fun!
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|this app works wonderfully on the kindle fire. but if you are a person that needs a more high tech calculator, this would not be the one for you. it has the basics like add, subtract, divide, and multiply, but it doesn't really have much more than that.
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|This is a great free app. I intend to get the full version. It not only works perfectly and smoothly, the app itself is so helpful and useful. It shows in detail how to perform so many different excercises. I use this app everyday, its a perfect little excercise for everyday.
B00AGOGOLE|1.0|I was looking for something that I could use for taking pictures with the Kindle -- this didn't work either (I got several products trying to solve that problem - yuk on all of them!),
B00A9C3RB8|1.0|I liked the trailer for this movie and looked forward to seeing it.  I ended up checking it out from our local library instead of renting it.  I am so thankful that I did!  I would have felt horrible if I'd wasted $4 renting this movie.  I expected a funny and fun movie.  Instead, this movie is slow and very uncomfortable to watch.  I didn't like watching or listening to the counseling sessions (which weren't funny) or the physical scenes that played out afterwards.  I'd definitely recommend finding something else to watch.
B00AFWEPVI|1.0|I wanted something that would take pictures - that did, but only if the Kindle was facing you.  Maybe I didn't understand how to work it, but that is a problem that should be handled by the product.  If it is too complicated, it isn't usable!!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I really think this is a great app! it helps me fall asleep like its supposed to. for me, at first when I put it on; the most random thoughts come into my head..then I start to feel sleepy and peaceful. I think I will tell everyone I know with difficulty sleeping about this app. What I really love about this by the way, is that you can costumise the ambience according to what you're used to so that wherever you are, it can sort of be a home away from home!  I would also reccomend this for babies and children. -A somewhat normal 14 year old<br />][_, {[]} ][_,
B005LAII12|5.0|It's adult humor and it is awesome! I bought this as a gift for my brothers after seeing it. Hysterical!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't stop reading this book.  Excellent imagery and suspense.  I am looking forward to reading the next in the series.
B009VB97EY|5.0|Besides seeing gorgeous strippers, this movie had more of a plot than I'd expected. Channing Tatum is PERFECTION! Happy for he and his wife.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Now that I've had my Kindle for a good long while I've got my reader's rhythm going.  I keep a tight budget, LOVE to read, and especially love to read new authors and outside my comfort zone.  Prior to my Kindle the tight budget was kept largely by utilizing my local library.  Unfortunately, I'm in small town rural area and the library system is severely lacking in breadth and depth.<br /><br />So, what does this have to do with \\"The Martian,\\" you ask?  Kindle's awesome, fabulous \\"sample\\" option, especially combined with bargain-priced and free books lets me search the written universe for hitherto unknown authors.  I load hundreds of samples each month and whiz through them looking for hidden treasure.<br /><br />If I read the sample and cannot wait a single solitary minute longer to see what happens, that book is a buy, regardless of price.  This doesn't happen often, so I like to take time to review the books that capture me and my dollars.<br /><br />The Martian was one of those books.  I ate this book up in two sittings, and would have been one had I not started it at midnight.  Imagine my surprise and delight to find it was only .99!  I'm still trying to figure out whose writing style Weir is reminiscent of, but it hasn't come to me.  And I like it a lot.  Next to Hugh Howey's Wool series, this is my favorite surprise book of 2012.<br /><br />What is so odd is that I loved everything about this book when I absolutely shouldn't have.  I don't care much for gratuitous profanity and this book is liberally laced with it.  I don't like my sci fi so \\"fi\\" that it is absolutely unbelievable, yet I loved this book and it's completely implausible hero and his journey--mythic, epic completely wonderfully unbelievable yet gripping!  I absolutely do not like my sci fi heavily loaded with too much techy \\"sci\\" either.  I don't care for lots of technical jargon, but I love some nice clean science.  Weir made the science and engineering feats totally engrossing and I actually read every word instead of glossing over the minutiae.  I don't care if it's real (yet), it felt real to me as I read the book.<br /><br />As I write this I realize that frequently during the book I considered that if my husband the mechanical engineer, mr. fixit extraordinaire were abandoned in the same scenario, he would have extremely good odds of surviving (and without a single curse word for bonus points).  So perhaps that is why the story really spoke to me?<br /><br />I encourage anyone who likes scifi/fantasy to splurge .99 and get this great book.  I genuinely hope the author is hard at work on his next book because I am so ready to read it.read every word instead of glossing over the minutiae.

B007ZGBZHE|5.0|It always amazes me how seamlessly these two writers (Lincoln Child and Douglas Preston) stitch together their wonderfully researched and exciting stories.  The only real problem I have with this latest effort is the basically irrelevant, but nevertheless suspenseful, storyline involving Corrie Swanson and her long-absent father.  A word of advice: do not attempt to read this book if you haven't read all previous ones in the series.  Books in order can be found on FantasticFiction.com, and every one is well worth time and money spent.
B009YU6FJM|4.0|I'm admittedly a casual Deftones fan. I've had White Pony and their self titled album. Neither captured my attention through and through. Koi No Yokan is the absolute best work I've heard from them. And it's probably on of the best metal albums I've heard in the last 10 years. It's not normal for bands who've been around as long as Deftones to produce something this quality. The instrument play is tight, the vocals are good, the tone is atmospheric and at times unsettling, and it all sounds very nice. Chino has developed his vocal range well, creating breathy and dreamy tones, while still throwing out an occasional screech. Each song is solid, and I highly recommend for hard music fans. Take some Tylenol and zone out.
B00571F26Y|5.0|interesting and thought provoking i'll try it and see how it works..i'm hoping to lose some weight with this program
B00A3AUGEW|3.0|Others see and hear Phillips differently, and that's fine. But to me his voice is so close to Dave Matthews, I find it irritating. Not that the song arrangements come anywhere close to Matthews; these are simple tunes. I don't mind an artist being reminiscent of others who've come before them. But when their work plays out like they've plagiarized their influences, then meh, blah. There's a few standout tracks here (Home, Can't Go Wrong). The rest is just ok. And I'm glad I nabbed it for only 2.99.
B007SGM084|5.0|I was told to buy the trilogy rather than buy the first book  individually and I was really glad I did.  To truly enjoy the book series they really need to be read consecutively.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|This twitter app gets the job done, nothing special about it. I like the convenience of having an app for twitter.
B005LAII8A|3.0|This is an enjoyable movie with some good acting. Good to see Emily Blunt in a heroine action role.<br /><br />It starts slowly and I found I was struggling to concentrate. However, by halfway through the pace had picked up and then was a thrilling ride to the end. Good special effects, clever concept using time-travel and very good acting.<br /><br />One key issue for me was I didn't believe Old Joe and Young Joe were the same person, just 30 years different in age. I think the director should have aged Gordon-Levitt so he could play both the old and young Joe. Would have made it a little crazier too, seeing two similar looking dudes shooting it out.<br /><br />Liked the idea of Emily Blunt's young son and the power he possessed.<br /><br />Good ending, if a little predictable.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|This was one of my favorite Stephen King books. Great characters, engrossing story. Never felt bored(which usually happens at some point in a SK book). Fun time travel, made 1958 come to life.
B003INBNXO|5.0|I loved this movie. Exciting, intriguing, with a good story line, and some awesome Kung Fu. I had never seen a Kung Fu movie but my friend was excited about this so I watched it and I'm glad I did! Sick movie.
B003L7DK74|5.0|It's Flight of the Conchords, what more can I say? I wish they were still making them...It made a great gift.
B004X4QW42|4.0|The first IP Man is a classic. I didn't even know if I would like a Kung Fu movie but I loved it. The second one is good, just don't expect to see anything like the caliber of the first...
B009JNXK88|4.0|I like the gameplay on my kindle fire. The jump button doesn't always work when I press it, this can be frustrating at times.  It takes no time to get back into the groove though. keep them comming noodlecake!
0525958002|5.0|I'm not one to stop and write a review, but I had to acknowledge this incredible story. I grew up on MTV, first concert ever was Duran Duran (I became a musician because of them), and as a teenager I was paying serious attention to DD throughout the 80's. I was pulled back in to the memories of my youth reading this book as DD played a major part in providing the soundtrack to my upbringing. Anyone into the mythology around a band will appreciate this read. It's real, its awesome, and it's very human. I boarded a plane from JFK to LAX with the book and could not put it down, I read it it in 24-hours. If it were a movie it's one part 'The Doors' and one part 'Blow'... it would make a great film. Respect to JT!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a brutally honest, meaningful, and truly captivating book. Written in letter format, a 15 year old boy is struggling with high school and not having friends. Stephen tells the boys story with such emotion and honesty, this book will be one you remember.
1419705849|5.0|My son loves all the DOWK books. He read this right away and loved it. 5 more words required yay
B005LAIISU|4.0|Our grandson requested this movie for Christmas.  He was extremely happy when he opened the package.  My husband watched it with our grandson.  My husband didn't like it as much as he had liked the original one but that is normal.  Our grandson loves it and watches it often.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Its a no brainer  needed a new cable for my kindle as the original one just dried up and cracked into many little plastic pieces. Bought new as i wasn't sure what i would get with used product.

B002RI9ZPY|4.0|Great 3rd book of the series. Full of suspense. Pity the author passed away when writing the 4th book of the series
030758836X|1.0|The first third of the book drew me in, the next third had me trying to hurry through to get to the end because I wanted to just cross it off the list of read books.  I figured it couldn't get worse.  It did! I hated this books ending.  I think she just didn't know how to wrap up the characters so she just leaves it.  Horrible book!!
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|Complete and utter awesomeness! A must buy for everyone. Especially if you have children! Awesome awesome awesome awesome!  Yes yes yes yes yes yes
B006K2WXOI|5.0|Takes you to a warm, cozy place from your childhood when reading to your children or grandchildren. Captures your imagination and allows you to dream of the possibilities in the magic of Christmas.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I can't really see what the big fuss is about!  I've read a few novels like this in the past, but none received the notariety that this one has.  Those other novels were advertised for what they were - sexual novels with a so-so story to go along with the sex.  Somehow it doesn't seem fair that E. L. James will make many millions off the &#34;Fifty Shades&#34; trilogy, while many other novelists who have written just as interesting a &#34;sexual escapades&#34; story have not.  She must have a great agent!
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|This movie was actually better than I expected it would be.  A cool new twist on the time travel theme.
B008SOSBJM|5.0|This is an incredible album! I love it so much. And the artwork on the record is stunning. I can't really list my favorite tracks because I love them all! This is an album you can listen to all the way through over and over again. Beautiful. No Doubter for life!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was hard to put down. It keeps you interested and always wanting to know what 's going to happen next! If there was a second book I would read it.
B008H6GH8I|4.0|The animation on this movie is visually some of the best I have ever seen. The story is great and involves fan favorite Ada Wong in a cool core plot role. If your a fan of the resident evil series then get this movie, you wont be disappointed.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Lovely weather app!  Wanted such a thing for my kindle fire and this app is pretty nice. The multi-day forecast feature is very handy indeed.
B009K0P10K|5.0|We thoroughly enjoyed watching 10 of Revenge Season 2 episodes and can't wait to see what's around the corner.  We watched all of Revenge Season 1 on Netflix.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The book is so much better than the movie was.  The movie left way too much detail out and it cut too many events out of the actual prepping and games itself.  I am glad I read the book first, this is my second time reading it and will be reading the whole series again.  The plot of this story really makes you think about a possible future if our world comes to this type of war.
B00A757EFW|5.0|I love this game!!<br />im getting really good at it and if u are thinking qbout getting it its totally worth it!
B004U8VWIM|4.0|Nice twists, kept me interested. Not something I would watch several times, but I'm glad I decided to watch it once.

0316227706|4.0|Wonderful, unusual pictures. I would recommend this for anyone who enjoys dogs. It is an attractive book to display on the coffee table.
B003F5NSTW|4.0|Will make for great discussion at book club. Very heavy themes. Has suggested book club questions at the end of the book.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was so fascinating and entertaining (just don't read it if your questioning your marriage or your partner).  I couldn't put this book down and I'm hoping for a sequel.
6305077630|1.0|I bought the movie as a gift for my husband.  We just tried to watch it a few days ago and the movie skips. We tried to skip it forward and it still didn't work. :(
0470901071|5.0|I first heard about this book back in 2010 during a deployment.  A civilian contractor for the military recommended the book to study for the CCNA and I can say this is the best investment I have ever made in a book!  I actually owned the 6th edition for my first purchase and after having it for a year it start falling apart.. but this isn't an issue or a negative comment about the book.  When my 6th edition fell apart I purchased the 7th edition which had lots of new information.  I was excited to learn what was left out!  I read the book front to back and back to front and I can say after all the reading I took my CCNA exam December 3rd, 2012 and passed!  I recommend if you purchase the book and are new to Cisco or networking then you should read the entire book in order!  Do all the tests at the end of the Chapters and review questions... make note of the questions you miss and insure you understand the technologies and material discussed!  If you follow the book as it states, this is the only study material you will need to pass the CCNA exam, I promise you!<br /><br />I wasn't able to use the extra material on the CD because both times Amazon sent me the book I received the book with a cracked disc due to mishandling, I guess!  But if you need a router sim I recommend GNS3, it can't simulate the Catalyst IOS.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|Very easy to use & it works great.  It looks great on the Kindle Fire HD.  Glad I purchased this app.
B007K3JFUQ|4.0|love this movie! Even though anything with Robert Downey Jr. is good The Sherlock Holmes series is still a favorite of mine. Would definitely recommend.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Facebook is the worst app I have. I have full connection and my web and other apps work perfect but I cannot get my news feed to load/refresh everyday. Please fix this asap. It's only on my kindle also, I do not have this problem with my phone!
159562015X|4.0|The only reason I give it a 4/5 is because you have to buy the book to get a code for the test. In other words, if you wish to take the test a second time, you'll need to buy a second book. Great gift idea, especially for anyone applying for a job (college grads, etc.)
B0063IH60K|5.0|First game I played on this Kindle.  Very easy.  Love all the different choices of playing.  This is one of my favorite card games.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I love strategic games such as this one. It takes some patience to figure out where to go, but it is alot of fun..I would recommend it!
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love this game a lot, first things first, but I found 2 bugs. 1 I have invisible zombies....I have looked every where I hear the noise(even digging) but there are not any to be found.......I can't see them, they can't hurt me, I can't sleep, but I hear them and its getting annoying 2 things around the edges of the world get blotchy in general....right now I have 2 pigs and a chicken that can't move no matter how much they splash around or get pushed. Please fix and I can bring it back up to t stars!(also on another note, it's hard to get animals attention with wheat)
B0051QIGP4|2.0|I prefer my albums to be thought of as a single large unit. This is really a collection of singles. For what I paid, not bad, but I would have been upset had I spent $10.
B008OOYALE|5.0|do not listen to the bad Revues thay are wrong this game is awesome olive it so much 15 !!!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I am stuck on one spot right at the minute but I WILL figure it out.  I know there is an answer to each puzzle.  I just can't picture it at this moment.  It will not conquer me!!!!  Love it!!!
B009G7ZYPY|2.0|I hate writing a critical review of an album I wanted to love.  To start with the positive, Ms. Boyle is obviously talented, with a lovely voice.  Her take on \\"Over the Rainbow\\" is fresh, understated and original.  Alas, the rest of the material.  Overall, this album leaves me wondering, \\"Where did that scrappy broad go, the one who shook her hips on Britain's Got Talent and made everyone take notice?\\"  I would argue that almost no one cover the songs on this album, so my bad for purchasing it.  That said, many of these songs are among the most overly-sentimental, overly-covered show tunes of the last few decades. It would be hard for anyone to add anything \\"new\\" to much of it.  The lush orchestration of the album only makes is sappier.  I couldn't help but think the unstated subtitle for the album is, \\"I am a sensitive artist!\\"  I realize that mine is the minority opinion, but I fear that a few more albums in this vein will kill the career of this talented songstress.
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|Angry Birds are still angry.  I got this to entertain the grandsons and it worked.  They are too young to get the whole Star Wars theme but thought it was fun to play a different version.
0765325950|1.0|I have read Sanderson's blog where he mentions that this fiasco (my word) is Harriet's fault.  For some misguided reason she felt that the NY Times Bestseller list was more important than the loyal fans who have been following this series for decades.  For everyone that is upset with all of the one star reviews, all I can say is this is how we are expressing our displeasure and we basically don't have any other way.  Personally I believe a three star rating is more damaging to the legacy then whatever a bestseller list would say, and let's be honest, it will be #1 anyway.  If anything I think Sanderson should come to our defense as the three stars make him look bad.  This was a horrible decision and they should reverse it ASAP.  If they do so and it is possible I will gladly change this review to the correct rating it deserves.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Did not want to read this set but it was what our book club wanted to read.  I was very pleasantly surprised at the story and the twists and turns.  WOW!
B006MW3V6U|4.0|then you should love this series too.  Well acted, it's an engaging British drama series set in the early 1900s.  High production values and interesting characters, even if it is pretty much a soap opera. And who doesn't love the irascible Maggie Smith?
B009LL4LMM|3.0|I got it for my grandson and he had fun bouncing the Jellyfish around but never really attempted to play the game.
B00571F26Y|4.0|I bought this book because it got so many good reviews. I think it has merit and plan to follow it-mostly. After he finishes about the downfalls of eating wheat and gluten and getting them out of your life; he starts in on all the other things you should avoid. That's when I lost interest. By the end of the \\"plan\\", you're not eating any wheat items, no other types of grains such as Quinoa and amaranth; no rice, brown or otherwise, no potatoes, no corn or products of corn, no fruit juice (natural or otherwise) and minimal whole fruit. So that leaves you with protein, veggies and cheese.That's when it sounds like every other low carb book you've ever read.
B004CR5TD0|4.0|The Wilhelm Scream intrigued me by the title. When I heard it, I fell in love. Blake is soulful, earnest, and knows how to mix a variety of genres to create a wonderful piece. It's not a dance album for sure, but his voice and lyrics make him a true talent. If you like slow, love-as-lost music, pick this up.
B005LAII1C|5.0|Seth McFarlane hits a home run with his first movie...funny as hell! Walberg and Kunis are gold! This is a must have movie!
B0076DELIG|3.0|The book held my attention but I thought the solution and ending were weak.THe way Bosch was censured for his visit to the jail was throw in out of left field.
1426209584|5.0|Beautiful photographs of incredible birds. A must have for any bird lover or lover of strange and unusual things. Highly recommend.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I found certain passages in &#34;LIfe of PI&#34; tedious but over all it was a good read.  I would recommend this to most of my friends with the proviso that I found some passages too descriptive.
B004TJ1H3C|5.0|I chose this rating because the series was intriguing. It kept my interest the entire time it was on television
B007HACDLK|4.0|vince flynn keeps you interested all the way through and  the ending leaves you thinking  about what mitch rapp will be doing in the next book
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Great book! Very exciting seeing how he would end it. The love story was wonderful with George and Sadie too.
B001AEF6C2|5.0|love it, exactly what I was looking for and was unable to find in the stores. Good value and great price
B005LAIIQC|5.0|The Bourne Legacy...fits perfectly with the Bourne series.  I see Renner and Damon getting together for a great co-starring movie.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Very entertaining. Can be challenging. Worth the dollar. Decent replay value. Fun for all ages. Great symphony music that works with gameplay.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|toataly the best<br />very good combat ang graffix<br />play all of the time... i cant wait for part two to come out on i-phone

B008SOS63S|5.0|excellent music ,Beth Hart WOW! The song Bird On A Wire really shows the power of Joes voice. Really great cd.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved every moment of reading this book! I seriously could not put it down! The last 100 pages took me through a whirlwind! Definitely worth the purchase! Can't wait to see the movie!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|It's music to my ears- heheh!<br /><br />This app provides rest and serenity to my brain. It's great!  I use it while reading, writing, or just \\"tuning out\\" from the real world for a while. I even sleep using it sometimes.<br />Get it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a very fun game,there can be moments were you make embarrassing mistakes but you can get better especially with the hover boards.
1439170916|4.0|This book combines my love of history and interest in medicine. I would recommend it to anybody wanting to know just how bad is the cancer situation today, compared to centuries ago? How much progress have we really made? Read it before you get a mastectomy, ladies.

B003Y5H57E|4.0|I really liked Carrell more after seeing him in this movie. He plays sensitive and loving very well! This is a movie for adults, about adults trying to work out issues during the breakup of their marriage. Sometimes funny, mostly sweet.
0316044695|2.0|As an Iraqi Army advisor in Fallujah from 05-06--I found Luttrell's description of SEALS as people that I did not know. Really. I thought that they were cool, laid back, smart professionals who knew close-order urban opns better than anybody I knew. I got them to operate in our battle space for their credit card, target lists, and professionalism. I read his book with interest but quickly got turned off by his unsolicited right wing politics. I think I just stopped reading when he mentioned that his team, when flying to Afghanistan, may cross into Iranian air space. But have no fear...he said, because we had a president who would stand by us! Nobody really says that stuff. I'm sure that Luttrell does and did, but I would have been far more interested in his actual interactions with politicians. The two times I had to drive my Iraqis to brief a Congressional delegation were either neutral or negative. That's what I would have written about. If you want \\"right-wing Christian\\" justification for the war, this is it. If you want his side of the story...this is it. It's there, you simply have to wade through the other stuff. He has full right to publish this but know that most people who served \\"over there\\" did not hold GW \\"a fellow Texan\\" (his words) in the same esteem. The book disappointed me...Sorry, my brother. If I ever write about my experiences, you can bust me on my political neutrality or questioning of lack of forces in theater...
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved it, just like I loved Slammed and Point of Retreat :) I can't wait to read another book by Collen Hoover
0375507256|2.0|I thought the book might be better than the reviews said the movie was.  If it was, then the movie was really bad.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I have watched this series from the beginning and happy to see it again from the start.  I am getting ready to watch season 2 again.  I know I will watch this over and over.  If you like period movies, this is the one to get.  The Brits do a good job on their productions.  Buy it, you will like it!
B008EK91XU|3.0|Good read to understand his feelings, too many statistics. Unless you are involved in swimming, it is hard to understand all the times required for him to swim.
B009WJX10G|2.0|I have watched, rewatched and purchased every episode/season of Supernatural to date. I've had a few that were not in my favorites list, but \\"Bitten\\" is the first episode that I have EVER deleted from my pc library. We have had episodes in the past where the Winchester brothers were not central stage (Ghostfacers, Weekend At Bobby's, etc.),those episodes had other qualities that made them very worth the time to watch. \\"Bitten\\" is, in short, a waste of film. Yes, the brothers do appear in several shots and give a short analysis of what they think might be happening. This episode however, does not stand up to the quality of the Supernatural brand. I am voicing my own oppion on this, watch it and evaluate it for yourself.  I already have season 8 on pre-order.
B009T3AHDE|1.0|Absolutely horrible, worthless film.  Complete waste of time.  I refuse to waste another minute on this review other than to say you have been warned.  Complete GARBAGE. This movie could have been summed up with an abstract painting and viewed in 30 seconds. Even if this movie was made into a single painting with a limosine, rats, a riot, and complete morons, I doubt you'd want to buy the painting either.  I'm not contributing a dime to this piece of garbage.
B002OSXDAU|5.0|I enjoyed Atlas Shrugged a little bit more, but this is a great book and has the same important message and warning. It is particularly pertinent given current events.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This is a really entertaining and thoughtful movie about older folks who are trying to make the best of poor situations. Fun but also thought provoking. Excellent acting.
B0053TMP24|4.0|It was interesting enough to keep reading but not my favorite book It set up the next book Mark of Athena well which I have high expectations for It also tied up a lot of loose ends nicely
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I've bought this on Kindle Deals knowing nothing about Hugh's work (thinking \\"why not, $1.99 isn't that much\\") and it turned out to be one of the best deals ever. The story, the pace, the characters, the style - it was all just brilliant. It was hard for me to stop reading and when I had to (my wife took Kindle from me), I figured out I could continue with my Blackberry app... Now I'm reading this once again (on iPad, sadly), slower this time. And getting ready for the prequels (and the final piece when it's ready). Hugh Howey is a great author and he's getting close to my top of the top (Terry Pratchett and Ray Bradbury, if sci-fi is concerned). If this is going to be turned into a movie or - more probably - a TV series, I'm going to watch this for sure. Waiting for more from him!
B000CNFC76|5.0|We bought the movie for our brother/brother-in law,  he like to play golf.  He loved the movie.  During Christmas,  he wanted us to watch it with him.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|love it! this game is a lot of fun and you'll enjoy it a lot! I cant put the game down!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|So, I play this app every day, and I would of give It five stars. But, I was just playing, opening a mystery box, and it shut down my kindle fire? I turned it back on, and EVERYTHING was deleted!!! I was really mad, because I got really far an it. Then I wrote this. ( by the way, If your thinking it was just a update, well, it was not.)
B0055PGUYU|5.0|As a student and teacher of psychology, I was intrigued by the title. This book gave me a new perspective on not only my life and habits but also those of others. Beautifully written with real examples to back it up-to-date a must read!
B004SBQAN8|5.0|love this movie  love Alex have all his movies this was a good story funny and sci-movie for all,you will definately like it
B001BR3P0S|5.0|Always a good movie to show your children once they are old enough  good memories and to see how young the actors are that are now old enough to have their own children
B002ZG975Q|5.0|very good movie not seen by many but its there loss,i love Alex and Vanessa  was perfect for her role
B000C20VPA|4.0|was in the condition that is was described and works great, this is a classic movie my husband loves it thanks!
B00979JSZ8|5.0|This  show never falters.No doubt series four will be as impressive as the  previous  3.Where else in the world can  you see a television series that  has the very best in writing,acting and direction? One  word of warning  when watching this  Highlands episode: DO NOT  watch the  only extra on the disc  before seeing the  episode. I made that mistake and and was extremely disappointed  to find out  what happens to one of the main characters. the question is - why did they  include a major spoiler  in the  extra.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Most entertaining!  I wish I had read the author's note before reading the book!  It may have changed my outlook a bit.  Regardless, I highly recommend it and am looking for more works by this author.
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|Progression was a little slow but great recovery!  The setting of context was a little flat and almost turned the movie off but it picked back up.
B000UZNSWM|5.0|This book reveals thie ineptness of General MacArthur in his handeling of the Korean War.  It also reports of the hardships and heroism of the men of the U.S. Army.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|I will admit I was never one to follow Batman since most of the movies were never able to grab and keep my attention but this version is so much diffrent! Heath Ledger is AMAZING as are the other actors! Ive lost count of how many times ive watched this, and i dont think ill ever get sick of it!!!!!!
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|There is too much vulgarity and bad language to make this a movie worth watching.  The  premise is so cute -- a talking teddy bear that stays with its owner into adulthood -- its just too bad that the filmmakers had to spoil it. Watch the preview and you've seen the best of this movie.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks did it again. Another romantic masterpiece! If you haven't read some of his other books go read them, ALL!
B00AE2IJIE|2.0|We found this movie to be a little scary for our kids. With the zombies and the creepy witch... it was just all a bit too much.
B009K0P10K|5.0|If you haven't kept up with Season 1 (available on Netflix or similar), this video really does a comprehensive summary of the entire season.  Enough to bring someone up to speed without watching the previous 22 episodes.<br /><br />Nice preview of what's to come in Season 2 after summarizing Season 1.<br /><br />Price was nice - but this one should be free as it is intended to be a teaser or recap for gaining viewership for the current season.<br /><br />Would like the volume to be a bit louder since I struggled to hear some spots using headphones and volume settings at max for both computer and video player.  Shouldn't need an amplifier.  At least the background music to speach volume is balanced unlike other tv shows where the music blasts and the people whisper.<br /><br />Thanks for the free episode, watched it twice now just in case I missed something.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This is such a good game. It is fun to play and easy to learn and catch on. I like this game a lot.
B005P5TQPU|5.0|Huge fan.  This got me caught up and made me more of a fan. Castielle is an assest to the duo of Jensen ackles and Jared padelecki.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's thin and compact, easy to use, has all the functions I need and it is very accurate.  Love it!
1594481717|5.0|description fit the product, very fast shipper, professional, courteous, will use again in the future when looking for great used products
B0007TKNL0|5.0|This movie and it's music haunted me for days and I will watch it again when I wish to be haunted for days.  A good movie and great story....I recommend it to everyone.
B003L77GH4|5.0|I bought these DVD's as a gift for my friend and they were in amazing condition.  This is an excellent show!
6301978587|5.0|This movie is more for adults and there is a moment of innocent nudity in a bathing scene in a pond. This story takes place in the another country in another time and in an age of innocence. Young children who wish to see it should watch it with their parents.  I am from the old school where one does not need to interject profanity in every sentence to make a point and This movie did not have any. A good story worth it's 5 stars.
B0058O84G0|5.0|i could not put this book<br />Brilliant brilliant brilliant<br />factual and entertaining<br />a read for all age groups<br />i cannot wait to start the next book
B006BAEQB2|5.0|Philippia Gregory has become a favorite author of mine. Her historical facts mixed in with fiction makes me want to be in the Queen's court.  But, which queen?
B007KZY1YY|4.0|not for the faint hearted or for under 18 years of age<br />it has a good story line and readable<br />i enjoyed this novel
B00APUYWYA|5.0|With no plans for New Year's Eve, we decided to watch this based on several recommendations.  It was absolutely perfect.  We loved it and would easily watch it again if we owned it.  And I may still actually go and buy it.  It's definitely one of those films that leaves you satsified and smiling.
B007KOYEOC|3.0|very predictable<br />certainly not great english<br />not as entertaining as the first two novels<br />i would not have read this novel as a matter of first choice
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was a funny book great for anybody with kids who don't like reading it was a little short for me though.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|If you liked Bridesmaids you will love this movie!! Too funny! Only problem was I could not get it to open to watch it the next day through Amazon, even though I rented it for at least 2 days, would have been worth watching twice!
B007N8RULO|2.0|Would rather pay a few bucks up front for the app than getting it free but having to face an ad between each round.
B009369Z8A|4.0|I watched this movie with a couple of friends and it kept us riveted to the screen the whole time. The pacing of the story didn't lag and the music soundtrack fit the mood of the movie very well.<br />The movie is obviously different than the book, but it seems like it was a pretty decent adaptation.<br />All in all this was an enjoyable movie and worth a watch.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Don't know how much of this Tom Clancy actually wrote but he does a good job of putting together a team that again and again produces a journeyman, consistently enjoyable read,  This book gives an eye opening look at what a not so distant future war would look like, both a cyber and military action.  Very realistic.  Four stars.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|it's based on an absolutely gripping series of novels.  All the major plot points are there.  Some points that are very important in subsequent books are highlighted even more in the TV show than they were in the book.  I'm not a movie critic but I really enjoyed this series.  When I have time I will watch it again.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Story too short but interesting. Might make a good B movie. A lot of padding, but the characters were okay.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Kids love it 9&11 and now they have me their mom addicted to,,lol<br />Only thing bad it runs my phone battery down fast :(
B0038M2AZA|5.0|This is an inspiring film.  Temple Grandin, though autistic, was awarded a doctor's degree.  She credits her Mom and others who took time and interest in her.  Well acted.  Loved the movie.  Gave it away as Christmas gifts to the significant people in my life.<br /><br />Dorris M. Schulz, Ph.D.<br />Director for Missionary Care<br />Missions Resource Network
B0042KA4VO|5.0|Vampire Diaries is my favorite TV show.  I don't think I have ever enjoyed anything as much as I have enjoyed having all four seasons in my Amazon Video Library where I can pull up any episode, any time and watch until my heart's content!!!!
B0028RXXE8|5.0|Excellent quality, good story line and acting, well cast, good character development.  I was disappointed it was only two seasons in length.
B0096HIEE2|5.0|This is a fun movie to watch through once...then from then on just fast-forward to the 'good' parts!!!  It is worth watching just to see Channing Tatum dance!!!
B007TNS6JI|4.0|Over all a good game, the extras are a little annoying sometimes. And it takes a while for the update to downlaod
B008ETOSYI|5.0|Such a great movie for a cozy restful afternoon!  Zac Efron does a great job and helps you remember how appreciative we should be to our military troops who sacrifice so much for us while they pay the price!
B009VB97EY|2.0|This movie had no direction and was very choppy.  The acting was horrible.  I gave it two stars for the dancing.
B003O86FMW|5.0|My favorite<br /><br />This is my favorite book ever I've read It 56 times and I've . Read monkingjay 78 times
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I will buy anything that Colleen Hoover writes.  Seriously, this is the best book I have read in a long time!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved the book! Can't wait to read the other books! I'm not sure it could get any better, but we will see!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I bought this CD for a friend and she absolutely loves it! I listened to it is pretty amazing! Way to go, Piano Guys! Keep up the good work!
0374214913|4.0|I am an older person and keeping up with the latest technology isn't easy.  The main character in this book is, I believe, named for the god Janus who looks both forward and backward, the god also of doorways and new beginnings.  I was intrigued by this aspect of the book.  I thought the characters could have been more finely drawn, with more depth.  Although it isn't a page-turner, I'm glad I kept with it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I liked this book read it after I watched the movie, book was way better! I hope the next movie is better
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Very thought  provoking, comforting and encouraging.  The scientific approach he takes adds validity to his experience and and he gives a glimpse of something so powerful we can all experience.  I loved it!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I hated Travis I loved him. I hated Abby I loved her. So many emotions i was sad when it ended.....
B00AMBH70S|5.0|This was a pleasant, action packed, surprise considering the main star of the other Bourne films was not in it. I was very happy with my pick and would like to see more of the same quality
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I loved this game but then on like the third day it all started over. Like I had bought two characters and earned two characters (which is kinda hard to do) and I had a bunch of coins and was about to buy another. Then, when I got on, it restarted, even the missions.
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|I absolutely loved the movie, however the album is strange to listen to at times. The music for the film was all recorded live - which allowed the actors emotional depth and freedom the lip-syncing doesn't allow. This album takes that live recorded movie soundtrack and clips certain songs to fit time constraints. It would have been a much better album if the cast had recorded a separate soundtrack album versus the movie soundtrack. All that said, I have still listened to it repeatedly in the car! 😊
B001AITH50|5.0|Classic film,  I love the selection and prices on Amazon.  Blu-ray is the way to go and you can't beat the deals on Amazon.
1451695195|5.0|You have to read it; maybe not just once. This is so well-developed it truly whets the appetite. I consider no one can doubt its veracity.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I like this app because there are so many options.  You can mix lots of different sounds at different volumes.  You can save different mixes that you have created for quick future use. Great app!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I would recommend it to anyone who believes in love and fate and happiness. Well done Mr sparks
B006LSZECO|3.0|Loved it.  I highly recommend it.  Ridiculous that you h ave to  write a review.  Kindle is not user friendly.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Typical fast moving Clancy novel and interesting technological detail.  The cyber warfare aspects are auspicious if accurate and, I suspect they are at least close.  Should be on the Pentagon, State Dept and CIA reading lists.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Clear, quick, nice to look at, and very much worth the two bucks!  I can certainly recommend it for general use.
B0000AC8LR|5.0|...of all time.  Great movie.  Great music and soundtrack.  Started out as an underground indie film and became a cult classic.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The story continues, it's hot and steamy, and well written. If only life could imitate literature, until then we read.
B001DJLD1M|5.0|...of all time.  I watch these movies about every year and still enjoy them.  If you haven't seen them, you must be living in a cave.  But it's never too late...
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was a very sweet and well-written book. Read it in a few days, and kept thinking about it afterwards.
0688156819|5.0|I am such a huge Tim Burton fan. I love all the work that he does. This is such a great read and a book to have in the collection. It is great to have such a great collection of short tales from Tim Burton.
B003PIUC02|5.0|A+ all around thank you awesome show i still watch it it,s sad they say this years shows will be the last RIP andy
B007TK77QE|5.0|Sure. Darker, sadder and more 'real' than Harry but if people were honest - the sheer brillance of this womans writing shines through here just as much if not more. Extraordinary.
B000O77RLE|5.0|A+ all around thaks this is one of the best movies i seen in some seens it shows just how bad world war 2 was
B006M4RN3U|5.0|\\"we are young\\" and \\"some nights\\" are major hits you hear on the radio all the time. The rest of the CD wont disappoint either! All Alone is easily one of my favorite songs on this CD. Usually CDs only have one or two songs of any value but this CD there isn't a single song I don't like.
B008LC8TJI|5.0|I bought this for my mom for Christmas.  She loves to watch The Voice and is always talking about Adam Levine.  So I made a last minute decision to get this for her.  A BIG hit.  She absolutely loves it.  They recently went to Florida and she said they played it the entire drive!  Wow. I think that says it all.
B00ADS90EQ|4.0|These ladies rock it! Their moves, the comedy, the songs stay with you long after the movie is over. The rolling commentary from the rogues gallery of supporting cast is spot on, and the love story at the center rings true despite itself. Perfect Pitch is a modern day classic comedy for young and old alike. It would be great if it were updated in the next couple of years since it is perfectly set for a sequel!
B005LAIHSG|3.0|I liked this movie but with all the hype about it before it was released, I expected a much larger story.  It seemed to end shortly after it began.
044654146X|5.0|What a fabulous book.  This should be required reading in all the schools.  Other nations should take lessons.  Fast reading.
B005LAIIQC|4.0|There were mixed reviews for this one, and its understandable after the Bourne series has reached iconic status in American film culture, and to re-work the series with a new turn can lead some viewers to ask for a U-turn.  Bourne has become the epitome of an understandable spy that we have grown to admire:  super-spy and car-chase finisher extraordinaire, yet with emotional empathy we can see how the consequences of his life go out of control.  We love the tale of his amnesiac state that moves forward to finally divide the moral blur that he has had to work under for several years as a Treadstone operative into reconciling his professional and psychological state.<br /><br />So when the Gilroy brothers decided to go with a new &#34;Bourne&#34;-like character, it would be a huge feat to keep the momentum going while retaining the fans for future installments.  They insert rising lead-role actor Jeremy Renner as Aaron Cross, another operative under a new program of operatives (called Outcome) who are enhanced through a regime of drug-treatments that enhance their physical and mental abilities.  When the events of The Bourne Ultimate (2007) break out, one of the heads of the program, Colonel Byer (Ed Norton), decides to shut down the entire thing, including implementing the morally disastrous decision to end the lives of the Outcome operatives who are serving their nation and unknowingly have no access what will happen to them.  Byer believes that the Bourne events will not only exploit the CIA's hidden deep cover programs, but theirs as well, so he seeks a complete &#34;burn to the ground&#34; of Outcome and re-build of it.<br /><br />Cross is targeted, as well as Dr. Shearing (Rachel Weisz), who is one of the main scientists in R&D of the implementation of the drugs.  Cross goes on a Bourne-like hunt for Shearing as his body will have an eventual breakdown from the lack of medication (&#34;chems&#34;) as he is totally dependent on them for survival.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie for what it is, a new direction in the Bourne series. I believe that many people were not as happy with the film was because, and rightfully so, it is a Bourne film, so we expect a similar themes, action, and drama that we saw in the first three.  However, as a standalone movie this movie brings something fresh to the table with a new intelligent twist in the spy genre- the implementation of super soldier status among field operatives.  What is the moral, emotional, and physical price of creating spies for the field who are deemed expendable?  Bourne was traversing Europe and America for his memories.  Cross becomes a new hero in his own right because he is left out in the cold by his former employers and is now racing against the clock to get his body and mind back.<br /><br />In terms of action, it is not original Bourne-like where there are frequent fight and car chase scenes.  But as a movie itself, it does a good job of using the similar themes of the Bourne franchise and going somewhere new with it.  It may not be for everyone, but it does a good job in my book nonetheless.oyed this movie for what it is, a new direction in the Bourne series.

B003Y5H5HO|4.0|Had to order this after I received the original Swedish version of this film as a gift for Christmas. My only complaint is the style of the case it comes in. You have unfold it about 4 times to get the disc out, and then you have to reverse the process when you put it away. All in all, I'd recommend this to a friend, just wish they'd put in a normal DVD case.
B008KOTNVA|3.0|What I liked about this kit was the different bits it offers. The driver and extension work well with the bits included.<br />However, the quality of the materials is not very good. At least not what I would expect for what I paid. I bended the driver extension a little on the 2nd use without forcing it.<br />I guess this kit suffices if you use it occasionally for some repairs or maintenance, but I would pay a little extra for a kit with better quality.
B0053O89Z6|5.0|we buy &#34;how i met you mother&#34; dvd every year since the first season, and always grateful for the delivery and product
B0095ZQ36G|3.0|Reads like a college level attempt at literature.<br />Style improves as it progresses, but one suspects gullibility on the part of the author. Generally, a good tale.
B006YTTVHO|5.0|This is a really good book. I thought it was very clear and easy to read. I enjoyed this immensely.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|I purchased this app for my 7 yr old. Does not run on the Nabi 2. The app would not open after a successful installation. Very disapponted!
6305603847|5.0|Even though you have watched it before, you find yourself catching something new that you missed last time!  First time viewers saying &#34;it's weird.....but I can't stop watching so I can see what happens next!&#34;
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Hunger Games<br /><br />My spouse and I really enjoyed this movie. We still haven't gotten to the &#34;extras.&#34; The society depicted in the story is extremely frightening/\.
B003TSEEDY|1.0|SOOOO BORING!!!!!! Seriously one of the worst books I've read...extremely disappointed. I was really thinking this was going to be a better book than what it was.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved it!!!!!! original, sexy and extremely romantic, i fell in love with both characters!<br />hope that part 2 doesn´t let me down!!!
B008J05EL8|2.0|Save your money on this application. The $5.00 you save will be better spent on a frap from Starbucks. I was disappointed in the package and sorry I wasted the $5.00. Do yourself a favor and save your money.
B003B02O0U|5.0|I could not wait for free time during my day to get back to reading the Pelican Brief! John Grisham is my all time favorite author of legal thrillers. This one was a real page turner!
B00785P2QC|5.0|o love this game so much I am willing to go through school this trouble to get credits to pay this game(:
B003L77GRO|5.0|The DVD series came still sealed in its plastic packaging so I knew this wasnt a used product, which is reassuring (You never know with online transactions) and came within the week of my order placement.
B0083Z614S|4.0|I really liked this story about children and how they grew up and the problems a child sometimes has to deal with.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Graphics are great and the game is really fun to play. Check skis Nanak is no lap . His jerk Kris Jones for Iowa.
B0049J0CTM|5.0|Quality was amazing! Such a fantastic, fun, and colorful movie!!!  This was my daughters favorite movie as a child, and it still delights the entire family again as young adults!
B003OUXECE|5.0|Wow. Just wow. This book is absolutely amazing. There's never a dull moment and so many things that are explained in the book that you may have missed or not understood in the game. The book gives the entire Bioshock experience a whole new meaning.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Five stars for the hunger games!!!!! I love this book so much<br />I recommend this book to anyone who likes the Harry potter series and the series of unfortunate events books
B007FEZQF8|5.0|LOVE IT!! Love to it the differences from the show and the novel over I really liked it!! 5 stars
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Beautiful darkness the sequel to beautiful creatures was so utterly amazing. Mostly I read memoirs and things along that line but this series has just pulled me in and I loved it.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Great product! when i took it out of shipping box I didnt even want to open it further,the box itself feels like leather or a rubber compound. Inside it comes with a book of pictures from the movie. Just a cool collecters item,recommend it to all Batman fans.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|We almost didn't rent this because of all the bad reviews warning of a terrible ending and that it was hard to follow but decided to anyway because we like the two leads. While I don't think it deserves all the 1 star ratings, it definitely isn't above a 3 star in my opinion.  They cheesed up what was an interesting story line with the usual degrading of women, strip clubs, some woman straddling a guy in her panties while topless, etc.  Usually they only throw that stuff in when the rest of the movie is crap, but it was backwards with this one...the rest of the movie was pretty good and they threw that in and knocked it down a notch in credibility. It deserved better than that because the story line was pretty interesting.  On top of that it went way over the top with glorifying gun violence.<br />But I didn't find it hard to follow at all and the ending made sense to me so I wasn't sure where all that was coming from with other people when watching it. It was however very slow at times and they easily could have shaved 20 minutes at least off of it.<br />What I will give 5 stars to is the acting by the little boy in it, really good job.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a pretty good app. Although it would be cool if the buttons were neon colored. Because who doesn't LOVE neon?! I hope that this review didn't help at all. :)<br /><br />Isabella Victoria :)
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|im totally addicted to this game!!  I wish there was a way to earn more peanuts instead of just buying them but still very fun to play.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A fun mystery...Kept me interested the whole way through.  I found the ending a little unsatisfying, but still creative and intriguing.
B001CTDH4Y|5.0|We purchased this movie after adopting our own Chihuahua. It was funny and entertaining. My family watches this movie about twice a week since purchasing.
B0090EKRKU|1.0|Being a fan of Dr. Seuss, I was looking forward to watching this animated film.  It was a huge disappointment.  I contrast this experience with re-watching a Charlie Brown Christmas, which was made in 1965.  Although some of the animation was interesting, they went way overboard trying to make this movie into a in-you-face, fast action film.  Maybe this is the current status of animation?  Anyway, as a result, the filmakers of The Lorax completely lost the subtlety in Dr. Seuss's message.  While I understand they need to stretch a short book that you can read in minutes into a feature length film, they probably shouldn't have tried.  In my opinion, they just killed the entire book.
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|Maybe my expectations were too high for this film. That, combined with the poor streaming video quality made for an unsatisfactory experience. I've streamed other HD movies from Amamzon and this by far had the poorest video quality.
0765325950|1.0|I'm sure it has been said before, but no e-book means no sale.  I am very disappointed that a desire to manage the best seller list is more important than providing willing customers a way to purchase a product.
B008Y76A5A|5.0|Very funny with a twist of romance. I love how two people from two states can come together and find out how alike/comfortable they are with each other. Def a must see!!!
8866130915|4.0|Thought this would have a little more room for writing notes, but it is true to the product description. I should have gone with the larger red one, as I did last year. Still good quality, and fits nicely in my purse.
B008OOYALE|1.0|TeamLava has always been my least favorite gaming company. This game is plain copycat of DragonVale.  And stupider! Nintendo will always be the best gaming compand in the universe. Go get a Wii instead
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I did not want to put it down. A very well written book. Looking forward to the second book to see where things go.
0061992860|5.0|This book is great, very compact size. Has many diagrams and is very informative. I would recommend buying this book for sure.
B00APUQMD4|1.0|Really bad. always liked Milla but you can only go to the well so many times. I hope they do not make any more it is done.
B000FC1CF0|4.0|The paperback had lots of footnotes explaining terms that are not familiar to most readers.  These do not appear on the Kindle version.
1451695195|5.0|I highly reccomend &#34;Proof of Heaven&#34; for everyone.  Reading this book completely convienced me that it is a true story.
B000050HTO|5.0|HEY HE WAS A GREAT POET FOR THE WORLD AND THE UNITED STATES, I HAD FORGOT HOW GOOD HE IS THIS IS A CAN'T MISS BUY
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Pathetic, I cant believe I ever thought this was a good idea to read this trash. The first book was ok but they just became more and more like bad romance novels of the early 60's.
B006MOW98E|4.0|An adorable set of Christmas stories that made my freezing cold, stuck-in-the-middle-of-winter heart all toasty warm. And I find that I'm ridiculously proud of myself for having read this on/for Christmas.
B00APUQRPC|2.0|I found this to be quite boring and the leading actress in this flick sucked!  I know she was playing a type A up tight lawyer, but I really didnt like her and didn't find her character to be believably knowledgeable in the area of the sport.  She had a cockiness about her that wasn't easy to embrace.  It sucked and Justin is way to good an actor for this flick.  BOOOO!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Although repetitive, I was addicted. I couldn't put my kindle down and had to keep going to find out what happens next.
B005I6EVUG|4.0|It is nice quality and price but when I saw the same thing at Walmart I assumed that it had a magnetic closure or a snap back. it doesnt. That was just for the display purpose. Over all I like it
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham did not disappoint. A page turner in his true style. I usually don't purchase new releases but I am glad I did this one.
B00005JL96|5.0|I bought this movie for a gift and it was in excellent conditions.  Really like the product and the movie.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|Although I didn't read closely enough to realize that this was the black & white version, I've been enjoying the original format.  Received delivery very quickly.
034580404X|3.0|I bought all 3 to have it at my book collection, but the case came all smashed-up and look pretty bad, like a used product.  It did not came with a plastic cover, just the 3 books inside a cover, inside a box. No protection at all
B007THA4FI|5.0|I work in social service and this book is right on the mark!  The world isn't always pretty. The story compelled me to keep reading till the very last page.  I enjoyed it tremendously.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|It is good game lots of fun. The puzzles are difficult but not to difficult to solve. I have liked all the games from this developer.
B0076NAVNA|4.0|I like this album, I really do. But it didn't quite blow my mind, so I didn't give it 5 stars.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I love this digital version of cross stitching; in fact, I probably love it too much.  The pictures range from ridiculously simple to maddenly difficult.  It's simple to learn and is quietly entertaining.  It works great on my Kindle Fire; although, recently it's forced close on me.  Despite the crash, my work is not lost and doesn't occur frequently enough to be a problem.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone who likes a good romance.  Everyone has baggage, finding someone who accepts it is the key.
B0083F5JE6|5.0|Another Christmas gift for my daughter.  She loves this cd, can't wait to hear it myself.  It's ok to play with the kids in the car.
0316236535|5.0|The simple words and fun story are perfect for early readers. My 5-year-old enjoys reading this story to his younger siblings before bed and has requested a second copy.
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|My daughter requested this cd for Christmas.  She loves it, but says that there are lyrics that are too vulgar to play when her children are around.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|the large buttons make it very easy to use.  I do not worry about hitting the wrong button. My son likes to use it as well.
1449417051|1.0|Ordered it on Jan 1st.  Still hasn't even shipped yet as of Jan 10th.  What's the point of a 2013 calendar if you don't have it in 2013?
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I downloaded the first book for free. After reading it, I was hooked. There are times I was bogged down with some of the details but over all it is one of the better scifi books I have read lately.
B000067QMD|3.0|While these discs will still fit on the top of an Avent Natural bottle and hold a seal, they don't fit snugly in the nipple hole like they do with Avent Classic bottles. So milk won't leak or spill, but when you unscrew the ring, you have two pieces to mess with. Unfortunately I wasn't able to find a sealing disc for the Natural bottles- hopefully they're coming soon!<br /><br />UPDATE: I did, however, learn that the rings for [[ASIN:B000EH2I18 Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Bottle Screw Rings, 4-Pack]] fit on Avent natural bottles, so I just ordered some rings and now the seal fits nicely in the ring on my Natural bottles!!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Love it! Looks awesome. Can't believe it looks and sounds this good. Not disappointed at all. And all for a great price!
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Good movie. Our son was one of the extras in the football stands. Continues the tradition of previous movies and introduces some new characters that you might remember from the comic books.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is one of the most gripping and BEAUTIFUL novels I have ever read! This is a book that takes a hold of your heart and does not let go.  Thank You Colleen Hoover for writing this amazing book!
B00846TRHY|5.0|I didn't care for everything that this preacher did or said or the way he did it, but if I were in that situation and saw what he did I might have reacted the same way.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The book starts out with a sheltered teenage girl and the bad boy she tries to avoid falling for and the secrets to their past.  Little by little the story unravels & just when you think you have the story figured out or that it's just another drama filled teenage love story you realize it's more than that...it has a more  sensitive subject matter to it & things really get crazy! I found myself wanting to cry for both characters who went from hopeless to hopefull.  Definitely not what I expected & in a GOOD way!!!!
0345803485|1.0|As a spanish native speaker living in Canada, usually buy my books at Amazon Spain. I was curious about the big success of this book here in Canada, so I decided to check some reviews before buying it in the spanish version. Well, the reviews of most of the spanish readers are basically the same as the ones I´m reading here, they agree that the book is merely crap, porn for moms and tons of other negative adjectives. Of course I did not buy the book, and will never do. Romantic/erotic genre is not my favorite anyways.<br /><br />Im just surprised of how this book has become a bestseller, having such poor reviews in its original english version, in spanish, and probably in many other languages.
B00979CS50|5.0|For any Neil Young fan- great cd. I bought this CD for my dad for Christmas. He is a huge Neil Young fan and recently went to his concert. He said he didn't know many songs at the concert but he popped the CD in and listened to it on repeat blaring through the house. (sorry mom). Most of the songs on the CD were from Neil's recent concert. Too bad my dad didn't have the CD before he went to the concert! Either way- the CD was a hit!
B0013USZHG|5.0|This live concert showcases the considerable skill and enthusiasm of this remarkable youth orchestra in a program that finds them very much in home territory.<br /><br />The program, with the exception of the encored Bernstein 'Mamba' is all original Latin American and is obviously completely natural to these players. The orchestra is a very large one with doubling of the woodwind and brass sections as well as an accompanying increase of the strings so the textures we hear are slightly inflated and not the same as those one would hear with a standard professional orchestra. This is of no concern in this concert as the atmosphere generated counts far more than worrying about such niceties as size of orchestra and the inevitable sonic consequences. It is doubtful if this very festive concert could be reproduced by any other ensemble with this level of sustained excitement.<br /><br />The final 'Mambo' steals the concert as it often does with this group, having become something of a party piece. Fortunately the recording does the occasion full justice.<br /><br />Comparisons are pointless in this case. For anyone interested in the program, or indeed the players, I would suggest that this disc must warrant very serious consideration indeed. It is truly a unique experience.<br /><br />Two further considerations for purchase:<br />There are two outstanding Euroarts DVDs which I would suggest would appeal to anyone interested in the Fiesta disc as above. They are:<br />1 Gran Fanfare played by the Venezuelan Brass Ensemble - equally exhilarating<br />2 Sao Paula 'Samba' - the 2008 New Year's Eve concert, Brazilian style!
B002T9H2LK|5.0|The special features disc was amazing!! I bought it mostly because it was a good value but we popped in the features disc first thing and were just blown away by the stuff they offered.
B006LSZECO|1.0|'Gone Girl' started out well but descended into a silly book.  To be fair, I only read 1/2 of it.  I just couldn't get through it.  It got some good reviews but I did not think it was well written or imaginative at all.  Just silly.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This is a fantastic movie. My children love it, my husband and I love it, it's just fantastic! I love the break from new-traditional fairy tales where everything is happy and perfect. Brave feels real. And who can help but love impulsive but good-willed Merida? The movie itself is graphically beautiful. Her hair is incredible, the mystical feel of everything in a time when myth and magic were part of common life, all of it lends itself beautifully to this amazing movie. Thanks again, Pixar!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I cant say anything more than everyone else! It is one of the funnest games I have played yet. I have played 30% and am looking forward to the rest...
0765325950|5.0|It's a great conclusion to a most epic series. The last battle had all the excitement that I could hope for. The ending left things vague enough to keep us imagining continuations of what happens afterwards. The only con that I can think of is that my favorite character seemed a bit off in the last three book. Brandon tried to do a good job, but his Mat just didn't feel the same as Robert Jordan's Mat.
B003PBB4ME|4.0|If you can imagine yourself using this and having awesome footage, then youre right!! Cant beat this for the price!
B00936A0RU|5.0|Went n seen the movie at the theater, loved it! To know that a lot of the events r true is amazing.
1609611543|5.0|Loved reading this book... so enlightening and informative... I think I have finally solved my issues with food allergies from reading this book. By eliminating wheat, I have increased my energy, health and got rid of bloating... GREAT BOOK! highly recommended!
B00931JMRE|5.0|I'm a big fan of ZZ Top n always have, haven't found anything on this cd I didn't like. Although it was downloaded to my mp3 player n has a ways to go before I can hear it again. They r good so will wait for it to come up again.
B0084BMUFA|4.0|It's wonderful to read the story the way Dickens saw it. Today, far too many movies give their version of this classic, leaving out much of what the story really shared.
B003AYMZO2|5.0|If your not already hooked on this show,  strap yourself in for a wild ride!!!! You will love it too!!!! AAAAAAAA++++++++
B006PW0F52|5.0|Some great insights into what triggers can drives honest or dishonest behaviors , writing flows well and simple to follow examples
B003L77GG0|4.0|I'm almost done with my collections.  Only need seasons 6 and 7.  The product was delivered on time but the only thing was that when I opened it the case kind of well apart on the inside.  I think its more of a manufactuer problem, but it would have been nice if it came intact.  The videos look fine (although I haven't played them yet) and that's the most important part.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Castle is one of my most favorite shows ever. I love watching the chemistry between Castle and Beckett each week and their minds work so closely together
B0065GC0BA|5.0|This book is one of the best books i have read in such a long time, i have read a few books since and this one is still on my mind, it is a very touching and heartbreaking book :)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have to admit I wasn't so sure about all the five star ratings when I first started reading this book. By the middle I was so interested I couldn't put it down. By the end I was absolutely blown away. I don't understand why a few people have said this book is predictable because I don't agree with that at all. Not only was the story itself amazing, but the author's writing style was incredible. This is one of the very few books I've read that didn't have me sidetracked by all the grammar mistakes. This is my first book from this author, but I definitely plan on reading more. Please take my word and read, read, read!!
B003M7BLOW|5.0|i can do everything i need to on my pc and then some thanks the speed now is amazing 5 stars from me
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was really entertaining  an  I loved it almost better then the movie I like how the book  is always different then the movie.
B00AECGQF2|4.0|I absolutely LOVE this app, and it was so worth buying, but I wish there were more charecters, or ideally a way to make one of your own. Still, not a reason to pass this app over!
B0063GORYU|5.0|This was a quick and easy read.  Good story, flows well, and was most exciting.  Will get next book now!
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I thought it was a good book and I loved the idea of Santa's scout. Likened that Manny turned.off the power just for him to be stocked up on heat.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I am looking forward to season 3 - but have to catch up and watch season 2 first!  Wonderful series!
B00003CXBH|5.0|A great movie about a very controversial historical event.  The cast is excellent and the music is hauntingly beautiful.  One of my favorites.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|I have Led Zeppelin media going back to LPs purchased in college.  They have always been my number one rock group.  There was no way I wasn't going to purchase Celebration Day CD & DVD.  And it did not disappoint!
0765325950|5.0|Before reviewing, I must admit a great bias that I hold. I love the Wheel of Time. I have read many books, many series in my fairly short life (I've still yet to graduate high school), but none compare to it. I also have not been waiting so long as many others for this. What has been a 20 year journey for many, has only been my high school journey. That being said, I don't think I will be as sentimental as other reviewers, as I am most certainly not as dedicated to the series as many.<br /> I believe A Memory of Light to be the greatest possible ending to the greatest epic to so far grace us. It most certainly has it flaws, and fans of the series will likely be disappointed at the exclusion of certain plot devices that were used heavily earlier in the series, and were seemingly ignored, or forgotten. Instances of this were my only problem with A Memory of Light, and its strengths greatly out weight them.<br /> I would greatly recommend this book to anyone, and everyone as a MUST read. Those who gave up on the series, either tiring of waiting for the end, or growing bored, will find it to more than live up to expectations.
B0062O85IW|5.0|I am not great at Excel and was working on a workbook I just wanted to get finished.  I wanted the book and I wanted it &#34;now&#34;.  Well, don't you know it comes in a Kindle Fire version and I bought it immediately.  It answered my questions and more.  I worked on my desktop with my Kindle Fire right next to me.  This is a great resource!
B0042FZOFU|5.0|The item was new, still sealed.  I would have spend over $70 for this set and here I got it so much cheaper. Cant beat the price :) Thanks!
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|I watched this because I like Bruce Willis, and he's always entertaining and I was bored.  I was surprised that the premise of the film made a certain amount of sense to me and easily followed after the first ten minutes.  It is science fiction and concerns time travel backward in time.  The show is built on hit men who have completed their contract and given 30 years to live until they are eliminated.  Bruce Willis really gives the movie substance with his flair for action films and the little boy in the film does a very credible job.  All actors did a good job.  I enjoyed it in spite of myself.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I like reading the Bible...what is not to like.  Reading God's Word is reassuring that this world is His creation and He is in control and wants to bless us, but He will not bless a disobedient child, family, city, country or world.  He gave us His Son, Jesus, as Savior and Lord...a gift that when we accept it, we individually and collectively can change the world for a better place for everyone.  Later, I will purchase other versions of the Bible, as well.  Try reading it, and if you allow it, the message will change who you are and those around you.  I suggest reading the book of John in the New International Version or the New English Version which I will purchase later if you have them.  Thanks
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Couldn't put the books down. Great read. Will read more from E L James. I'm glad they r available for the the kindle.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Well-written story that keeps you guessing & entertained.<br />Interesting cast of characters & strong knowledge & foundation for the criminal enterprise.
B0063IH60K|5.0|easy to play- the graphics are decent as well. I like that it has different play options as well. don't like the little ads though.
B006T3RM08|4.0|Paying $30 for a piece of plastic molded to fit a keyboard and trackpad was not exactly ideal, but if you're using a Mac Mini for an HTPC, as I am, it might be worth it.<br /><br />The keyboard power switch is cleverly done, but in a bit of an awkward position. The trackpad power switch is a different story. I don't know if it's my unit or a general design flaw but I find that to get it to function I have to press fairly hard and pretty precisely at the center of the button -- when pressing toward the edge it doesn't activate the trackpad's power button at all.<br /><br />All in all I'm fairly pleased. I would have hoped that for a $30 piece of plastic that slightly more attention to detail would have been put into the design of the trackpad power button (or just leave a hole so I can reach in and press the real button). But at the end of the day I have what feels like a solid kb/trackpad combination that is comfortable to use on the couch and adds almost no extra weight.
B0015DROBO|3.0|It was really hard to get into this book.  If I hadn't paid money for it I would not have made it past the first chapter.  It did get better after that though.
B000JMKSE2|2.0|not intersting very boring still haven't read this whole book yet hope to get it over with soon so I can go on to some thing better
B000002NCW|5.0|Was received in new condition. Very happy the case was also new and not damaged.  Gift was for my son.  He is very happy with it.  Thank you.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|Our 5yr old daughter loves this film so we bought the film for her as well as all of the toy characters for her to act out the film. The film has very likable characters and a a lovely story line in fun Rio!
B00006D295|5.0|I received the movie in great condition. There were no scratches and no skipping, better than renting a movie. It was a great movie as well.
B007FIY3VW|1.0|It doesn't do what I need.  I got an excel file into the program but that is all.  No way to enter info. or at least I didn't have any luck.<br /><br />Of course I know the way to really go and that is purchase a Microsoft Surface or something with Windows operating system.  So don't waste your money.
B0091REZMW|3.0|pretty fun except after you get through a few rooms there is no way to refuel your energy. Instructions not very clear on what you should do.
1449410243|5.0|Very cute and funny.  Even my stoic husband laughed.  I bought it as part of a (late) xmas gift for my cat loving friends as well.  I've had cats all my life and it is pretty much dead on with the cat-isms.  Wish I would have thought of it!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|First off I must say what I shove in there in the end of the day.<br /><br />- Canon T3i Rebel EOS<br />- 18-55mm lens<br />- Rode VideoMic<br />- Flip Video Camera<br />- Duct tape (No Hate on the Tape)<br /><br />And with all that i still have room to shove a few other lenses in there, but I've only had it for a day now so we shall see on its first outing. It feels sturdy the straps look well attached and the buckles don't feel like cheep plastic.
0061974307|3.0|This book was neither wonderful or horrible. I read it all the way through but would have picked something different if I could choose again because of my limited time to actually read.
1452111014|5.0|This was a gift for my husband and I expected a nice book; but, this was so much better than either of us ever could have imagined. I love the quality of the paper and it shows you a lot about how they thought up the characters and their world. For a true &#34;Wreck-It Ralph&#34; fan this is a must have!  :D
B00478CFAE|5.0|Great people with great music.  These two are my favorite artists right now. I plan on buying more of their music in the future.
B009IF7V2S|5.0|Its not for kids . One of the funniest movies I have watched in a long time. ! ! !
B007SGM084|5.0|The first book took me back to my first love. I felt how Ana felt and that feeling is the best feeling in the whole world. Hard to put down. Thank you E.L James.
B000WAEJZ0|5.0|Perfect Whitney! Clive Davis is awesome!<br />Sing alone, dance, decades of hits.<br />Can play on repeat all day for an uplift.
B005BY3XHC|4.0|Great read so far if you are into self help books and you may have to read certain parts more than once so you get it.
B006LUCV4Q|5.0|A dark and beautiful album that lulls you into the deeper emotions.  Wonderfully composed piano and she has a great voice!
B004UNX1LS|5.0|Love Vevo. Would recommend to anyone. Very easy to use, navigation is easy, even my 8 yr old love to watch Michael Jackson and The Black Eyed Peas. Great App.
B008EQIEWS|4.0|it was good  . i love this movie . in 3d was even better . i recommend this movie.<br />barnd new
B000VHMF0A|5.0|A great compilation. Obviously one could wish for additional tracks to have been included. I love &#34;Trenchtown Rock...&#34; the live version which ain't here...and don't love some others that are. That's the fun of compliations.  On the other hand...this is a lousy mp3. I hate files. This is a nightmare we will never wake up from I always say. These tracks DL @ 256. I'm glad we only paid a buck!  Nonetheless, Bob Marley music is priceless. And there is such a range of messages, clearly one comp cannot capture it all.  For folks who want to discover a Marley ovrview this is a great way to do it. Although please, please, get the &#34;Live&#34; (London Lyceum) set next!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|this is a great game. I am on the second level of the black dragon. game compares favorably with other mahjong games that I have bought or played Ianthe past.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|First as a Christian and aspiring ultra runner I thought this was quite a good read. I disagree theologically with  the ideas of Buddhism and transcendence, however looking past that a very good read and look inside of the mind of a running legend.
B006O6F932|3.0|I bought this playset for my 6yr old daughter for Christmas. Monster High dolls and the like are extremely popular with the younger kids, so to say this toy was a big hit with my daughter is an understatement. That being said, this toy is just like every other toy made these days, cheap and unsturdy. As soon as my daughter opened the gift she had to take it out of the box and set it up. I felt bad for her as she tried to set one part of the set up only to have another part she had just previously put together fall apart. I stepped in and put the thing together for her, but it was still flimsy at best. Definately not worth the price tag, but if I take into account the joy it brought my daughter on Christmas Day and beyond, as well as how happy that made me, I more than got my money's worth. If your child loves Monster High, you will  probably be purchasing this somewhere down the road.
0765325950|3.0|I have not yet purchased this book and I will be doing so in April when the eBook comes out (hopefully sooner). I just wanted to make sure people are aware the reason its not out on eBook has nothing to do with profits. Harriet wants to safeguard her late husbands legacy and make sure the book reaches number 1 on the best sellers lists. Some of them do not factor in eBook sales, or separate that to a different category. Still disappointing, but at least its not just about money.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|you Can only get so far before you have to pay to move forward in this game.  SO frustrating.<br />dislike!
B005IU1OMA|5.0|Best snowboard movie made in a long time. I've watched it at least 20 times so far. Buy it now!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use Evernote on multiple devices and store both my business information and personal projects there. If you use it for nothing but note taking, it's wonderful, but it can do so much more - storing information in PDF's and Word and Excel files if you go for their premium (paid) service. The interface is very user friendly. You can't beat this app - especially for free. Try it, you won't be disappointed.
B000002AGN|5.0|I enjoyed &#34;Take Five&#34; in college and finally have it as part of my collection!<br />The other selections are a bonus.
B000V39KDO|4.0|It's not that this isn't a well done movie, but it wasn't exactly my cup of tea...However I ALWAYS have been, and ALWAYS will be in love with the VERY talented and INCREDIBLY sexy Gerard Butler, so he saved the movie in my opinion!
B008JF8O9M|1.0|I have an Epson NX430.  The list of printers it works with has everything except my printer. That's is disappointing.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|I ABSOLUTELY LOVE &#34;Pitch Perfect&#34;!!!! I saw it twice in theaters and have watched it another half a dozen times since purchasing it!!!!
B008DW6VOQ|5.0|I use this app on all my devices, both Apple and Android based. Bloomberg again has done a great job of getting the information you need.
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|LOVE the movie, LOVE the soundtrack! The only downside (in my perspective) is that they didn't record &#34;Titanium&#34;. Other than that, it is PURE PERFECTION!
B005EGXTEE|4.0|I chose this rating because the series was interesting to read and adventurous.<br />I would recommend this book for kids from 11 years and older.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I use Yahoo everyday.  I check my mail, everyday, first thing in the morning, on my Kindle Fire HD. It gets me going in the morning!

B00A0SQBDM|5.0|Great game my favorite so fare can't seem to out it down. At least until I need to charge my Kindke
B000001EL7|1.0|The first six Kiss albums (Kiss, Hotter than Hell, Dressed to Kill, Alive, Destroyer, and Rock and Roll Over) are the only legitimate Kiss albums from the original members.  I speak as a true Kiss fan from the age of five.  There are many Kiss fans (even the knowledgeable, die-hard Kiss fans) who want to include Love Gun as being of the same caliber of the first six albums, but they are dead wrong.  This album is shlock, pure and simple.  Kiss always walked a fine line between musical brilliance and cheesy sleaze rock.  Well, this album is a face-first belly flop into the cheesy sleaze rock category.  Plaster Caster?  Almost Human?  Got Love for Sale?  Really?!  There is an original 70s era review of this album floating around on the Internet which nailed it.  The review mocked the superficiality album--even by Kiss standards--for example, noting that Tomorrow and Tonight is an obvious and failed attempt to recreate Rock and Roll All Nite.  Rock and Roll All Nite is an explosive and exuberant expression of youthful energy; Tomorrow and Tonight is an efforted and utterly forgettable studio attempt to mimic it.  On the first three albums, Paul's lyrics spoke of love and lust in a sincere, playful way.  However, after a few years of living the life of a rock star, his ego grew a notch or a thousand, and his once clever and earnest lyrics became jaded and crass.  And I quote (from I Stole Your Love): \\"How does it feel to find out your failing your test?\\" (pregnancy test).  The song is about Paul taunting a girl after having his way with her.  Paul, circa 1974 (Comin' Home, Hotter Than Hell): \\"I've been to east and west, but baby I like best the road that leads to you.\\"  Paul, circa 1977 (Love Gun): \\"No place for hiding baby.  No place to run.  You pull the trigger of my love gun.\\"  Nice.  That's some rock and roll poetry for you, huh?  I dare anyone who professes to be a fan of this garbage album to first listen to Mr. Speed on Rock and Roll Over, then please find me ONE track on Love Gun that compares.  There are none.  Kiss was done by 1977.  Fact.E track on Love Gun that compares.  There are none.  Kiss was done by 1977.  Fact.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I don't play this program much because my 10yr old is always playing. She loves it! She's had a little trouble with the free version locking up, but not often enough to discourage her.
0765325950|1.0|I Already added a review to the Canadian side of Amazon but seeing as how two days after release and I was the third person I figured my opinion wouldn't have much weight. I think better to be a number her. I'm insulted that I have no ebook option. The closest thing I have to a book store is a grocery store. I refuse to pay more and weight longer for a large book I can't pack with me everywhere. No, I'll be pirating this; if I can't find a pirated copy, I will give TOR the last $25 (that's how much it is in Canada) they'll get from me and I will scan the pages in and distribute them through torrents.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I enjoy playing this straight forward solitaire game. It's addictive! I don't mind skipping past the ad at the beginning of a new game,it doesn't slow the game down at all.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Fantastic ending to a fantastic series. Could not have asked for a better ending. Felt like Christmas morning with Suzanne Collins as Santa surprising me with everything on my list.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This is a powerful drama with an original theme.  No wonder it garnered several awards. Clare Danes is impressive, but the male lead is even more so, with (usually) an &#34;ice-water-runs-in-my-veins&#34; mentality.  Every one in a while he softens, and that is believeable.
0060531053|5.0|Great book and gift for my husband who is just getting into home brewing, came higly recommended by a few friends!
B004Q9P72C|5.0|Bought this book for a friend and ended up reading it myself.  It is a positive book and easy to read.  Buying from Amazon is a plus.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Note: we didn't grow up watching  A Christmas Story. In fact, we never learned of it until about three years ago. This may be why we don't get why *that* movie is a tradition for so many.<br /><br />I guess it's like Miracle Whip. If you grew up with you don't realize just how lousy it is compared to, say, mayonnaise.<br /><br />I'm just sayin'....<br /><br />:-)
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Loved the book.  Bit slow to get going and you can definetly tell there's a new writer as part of the mix.  Great plot, great development and awesome ride!
B00271HAK8|5.0|we forgot what a good &#34;How To...&#34; it provides for mischief. We are now eyeing our youngest (and wiliest!) warily. :-)
0446554995|5.0|I gave the book &#34;Two Graves&#34; a 5-star review.  I love the main character Pendergast, who has more lives than a cat.  The book is fast-moving and catches your interest from the first page.  Preston and Child, my favorite team of authors, always come up with an exciting plot, but this book is one of their best.  You won't want the book to end.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I love this book because all the gods and goddesses just make the book more interesting Sadie I have  to say is my favorite character and how she comes so close with Isis and Bast. I made my choice with a 5 star rating because you should just get this book just saying clear off your schedule because you are going to read this book all day and night. I recommend this book to anyone who likes myths and gods and goddesses. ON TO 2 BOOK THE THRONE OF FIRE YAY!!!!!!
B00004Y6O9|5.0|Well, what can you really say about one of the great rock debuts of all time?  This is the album that changed everything and marked the end of the '70s guitarist with a taste of things to come.  In Eddie Van Halen you have the best guitarist the world had ever heard, coupled with an absolutely amazing rhythm section in Alex Van Halen and Michael Anthony, and of course, the front man to end all front men - David Lee Roth!  Add that to killer, classic songs with production that has stood the test of time, and you wind up with one of the absolute must-have albums of rock.  And things just got better from there, peaking with 1980's slab of sonic perfection, Women and Children First (although really, the first 7 albums are all jaw-droppingly good.  And yes, that includes 5150.).
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|A great book for 10year-old children and up it is the best book I have ever read<br />Yay a great book skydoesminecraft skydoesminecraft skydoesminecraft skydoesminecraft slamacow
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think this is a pretty good app for someone that is looking to kill a few moments while waiting on an appointment or something. it has some cute games for time killing but not something you would spend hours playing.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I read this book in 3 days. It's an easy read. I felt like I knew these woman & could relate to, on a small scale, their emotions.I loved learning more about the Aphgan history & culture. I really enjoyed reading this book.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved it sad it will be the last<br />The ending in the capital was unexpected .... poor kattniss. And absolutely love peeta
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Another great story that reels you in from the very beginning. So sad only one more left to read. Freed is next
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This game was surprisingly fun. After playing a couple of rounds I found that it was very addicting. I enjoyed the challenges that it possessed.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|My first app purchased for my kindle. The graphics, and storyline are very attractive qualities of the game that drew me interested. I played the demo version and had to continue for more!!!! I would recommend, if you are a game player with a  need for a little mystery and treasure hunting with a twist. GET THE APP!!! :)
B001EN71CW|5.0|This is a sci fi series that completely rocks.  The writing and the delivery are stellar.  You have to watch the series in order or you miss a lot though.  I don't know what the station was thinking to cut this series short.  Great to watch.
B008JFLWLE|5.0|The developer calls MyScript Calculator a \\"handwriting calculator.\\" I call it the most addictive productivity app I've seen since I discovered Wolfram Alpha a couple of years ago. It's almost magical to draw numbers and arithmetic operators on the screen of my Kindle Fire HD and have the app convert them to digital fonts and display the answer. Using the app is pretty intuitive, but there's a tutorial that shows how to use it (it's actually a link to a short YouTube video).<br /><br />This is one the few apps I use where a stylus is helpful. I imagine that on a smaller smartphone screen, it might be a necessity, especially for a left-handed person. The app appears to be fairly tolerant of poor handwriting, unlike some other handwriting apps I've seen where you have to be precise. If you need to change something, it's no problem. Just scribble on a number or operator, and it's erased. Or press the trashcan icon to erase everything.<br /><br />The app supports the following functions:<br />* Addition<br />* Subtraction<br />* Multiplication<br />* Division<br />* Fractions<br />* Square Root<br />* Pi<br />* Parentheses<br />* Exponentiation<br /><br />In the Settings menu, there are two unexplained settings:<br />1. Palm rejection<br />2. Palm rejection: Left handed<br /><br />The first of these was checked by default. Being left-handed, I checked the second one as well. I'm not sure what these settings do.<br /><br />I'm just beginning to explore the possibilities of Myscript Calculator, but what I've seen so far is very impressive.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|This was a great movie. Very interesting in its ability to tie together the past and the future. Great action.<br />We watched it twice!
0446554995|4.0|I am a long-time fan of Preston and Child. Their CABINET OF CURIOSITIES has always been a favorite of mine, presenting unusual characters in a fresh setting that immediately hooked me. Most of their efforts since have been well done and enjoyable reads, but the previous Pendergast novel was a disappointment to me.  I would also recommend that you take the time to check out their individual novels, most of which are just as entertaining as their joint efforts.<br /><br />They are obviously back on the right track with TWO GRAVES.  Agent Pendergast's character has been well fleshed out and he has been made more human, somewhat more 'normal'.  He is not portrayed as the always right, untouchable superman as he has been in the past.  Yes, the Pendergast stories continue to be a stretch, but you would have seen that coming a long time ago if you read and enjoyed THE RELIC.  Millions of us did.
1419553429|4.0|I bought Kaplan 800 for advanced preparation of GMAT. The book has nice collection of questions and it gives you what it promises, but the overall language of the book is unnecessarily verbose in its many parts, which is not the case with GMAT real questions. Apart from it, book is good.

B000TXR1GO|5.0|After reading a couple bad books in a row I took a chance on this one.  I have very little interest in cooking or the restaurant business yet he made this book still entertained.  It turned out to be one of the best books I have read in the past ten years!  Its not only about cooking and restaurants but also about a man finding his way through life.  Bravo to Mr. Bourdain well done!
0399160450|5.0|835 pages, the largest Jack Ryan novel in years, This novel ties up the thirty years of the Jack Ryan story, From Without Remorse to Threat Vector it has been a wild ride. I hope the Jack Ryan series has a few more novels to go
0062082353|2.0|Not a horrible book but could have been so much better.  The book went from a cool book describing what our young troops are going through in the Middle East and the journey of this  young man to get there into a pat myself on the back extravaganza.  He over did it a bit at times bordering on nauseating.  However he did have some insightful moments buried in there.
B005ZTFPFQ|5.0|love love love it. reminds me of what playing fun and easy games used to be like! still looking for ms pacman though.
1579128149|5.0|Very nice and well made book. Built to last. My son wanted a poster of elements but I got this instead, he loves it.
0385535147|4.0|I bought this book for my sis-in-law for Christmas. We live a distance apart. My husband and I were invited to lunch with them on Dec. 21st, but Iowa got a snow storm the day before. We decided the roads might be too icy, so we did not go.  So....I started reading the book and am hoping to finish it before my sis-in-law sets a new date for us to visit them. LOL<br /><br />John Grisham is one of my favorite writers.  As far as I have read, The Raceteer is just as great as his other books.<br />Joyce
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I LOVE this series!  It has captivated me like very few TV shows can do.  I would highly recommend it!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I read Hunger Games on the flight home for Christmas. I couldn't wait to get to the second book so I bought it online. It stands up to the first in terms of story. And yeah, I got the third one and devoured it as well.
B00526ZKYS|5.0|This book is filled with emotion and is written in such a beautiful way! Props to Lauren Oliver for this gem!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The tone turned in this book quite a bit. Bleaker and darker. Collins is not afraid to throw a wrench in the works. A must read if you've finished the first two.
B000W91RUG|5.0|Ordered this for my son for Christmas. He really likes it. Will order Season 2 for his birthday gift later.

0374275637|5.0|Very well explained with real life examples and own experiences.. &#34;Intuitive is nothing but knowing&#34;.  Many golden nuggets.<br />Useful for everyone.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This was a very enjoyable relaxing read and made me want to read more of this authors books. The author wrote the book from the dogs point of view as if the dog where telling the story. It was not corny, but covered a very touching family story of love, and heartbreak viewed by a dog that could not communicate to his master but certainly figured out who the good guys and the bad guys were. I won't spoil the plot by revealing the story but do believe anyone who likes a story with a wring of truth, good racing knowledge and a nice love story, that involves heartbreak, a wonderful child and the fight to keep her will want to read this book. It does have its twists and turns.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved it!!!! I was on the edge of my seat the whole book. I'm a mom and I love sleep...I didn't get much until I finished this book.
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|This is a very active Film.<br />Dispite the Fact that the People for the Most part All speak English.<br />This Film has so much depth that I had to watch it 3 to 4 times; to get the Full spectrum of the situation Presented.<br />First time is a thriller. Then- It becomes a scrutinizing look over.<br />To see the normally unnoticed Detail.<br />Very nicely done.
B0049985XW|5.0|An American classic.  Great performances and very good special features.  The take away iconic line?  &#34;Badges?  We don't need no stinking badges!&#34;  Now that I own it movie I'll be watching it often.
159420411X|5.0|Silver is brilliant, bringing you into the world of prediction and the inherent challenges in separating the wheat from the chaff.  Whether you love baseball, politics, are a business person or a math geek, Silver makes the science of prediction engaging, insightful and entertaining.
B00ARF92HK|4.0|I was hesitant to watch a remake, but this was high quality, cinematic.  There was a certain beauty to the special effects regarding the drug of choice in the movie.  Also, and this was startling, there were some graphic violence effects/results I had never seen quite like it before.  Dredd's rookie named Anderson added greatly to the depth of this film.  So, as a stand alone piece or as a part of the Dredd legacy, I'd have to say I recommend this movie.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Very fast paced and easy to read. Found myself needing to find out what happens next. Great character development for Ender. I understand they will be releasing a movie about this later this year which is what prompted me to buy the book. Well done Orson Scott Card.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Very interesting characters with lots of good twist and surprises to keep you reading :) I couldn't put it down!
B005WTR4ZI|4.0|I found it fascinating. Good data to back up their claims. I'm happy I bought it and would recommend it to all if you are wondering how far can technology take society. I'm not sure I agree that we are still only starting the 2nd half of the chessboard as the author's say we are. That would imply exponential changes still to come. It does make me wonder what happens to our society if the computers are doing all the work in our society, how do mere mortals like us make a living? Communism/socialism?
B005V4FJC4|4.0|This is an eclectic holiday album, pleasantly surprised with it. Fun twists on old favorites. Zoe really has a unique voice.
B0048IMZMG|5.0|I've loved Taylor Swift since day 1. Great voice with meaning. This is a great album. Every song is good. Listened to this album over and over. Will bye anything Taylor puts out! Well worth the cash.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is an amazing book! I would highly recommend this book to everyone. I'm not an everyday reader, but I was attached to this from the get go.
B0041D843M|5.0|I was told by a friend that this book would change my life-- she was correct.<br />You will seriously evaluate all of the beliefs you have held about healthy eating.
1400052173|5.0|I found the book hard to put down and gave it to a friend in the medical field.  She was thrilled to receive it as she had heard about the book and had earmarked it as a &#34;must&#34; to buy.
B001PPLIEG|5.0|This video came quickly for the holidays! It was a great gift and it has already been watched over and over.
B00006GA48|4.0|Different from the original LP, unfortunately.  At the time, it was one of the best albums of the decade from an American band.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator does the job!  Not a scientific calculator but for everyday calculations, it is perfect!  It is worth giving it a try!
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|Can't hit the growling thunderous lyrics that drew fans to them in the first place, but still very inventive and enjoyable music.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|Great book!  It gives you a very clear and practical guide to turning your life into the life you have always dreamed about!  I have been using it for a few weeks now and am already experiencing excellent results!  If you buy it, definitely use it and do the exercises--it is really worth the effort!
B007S3S8HO|5.0|They liked it and play it often.  If you like angry birds it is a great game.<br />Would buy again
B005QUQ99K|5.0|Can't fail with NINJAGO toy products for 7-8yr olds. Lots of selection offered and it was shipped in time for Christmas.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I've read all over the place that this book is fantastic and while I wouldn't rate it that high, it certainly disappoint. Fast pace, interesting characters and unusual plot line. There were several places where the book did drag, which is the only thing that kept it from 5 stars!
B00068ULLY|5.0|The DVD box set arrived promptly and although gently used played perfectly with no skips or pauses. I am very satisfied.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I could not stop reading this book!  I would stay up until early hours in the morning reading!  I read it faster than any other book I have ever read. The Enid really left you wondering what happened.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book and cant wait to see the movie. It was a book a just couldn't set down.
0765325950|5.0|I've spent over half my life reading this series and the book is finally the end of the series, it's not as good as if RJ had still been alive, and I do slightly regret that the other two prequels look like they won't be written (or the outrigger Novels, based in Seanchan), but I don't really know the state of those books. Just really looking forward to the Encyclopedia being released.<br /><br />Also to those reviewing the book badly, do you realise that that it has been well established and advertised that the ebook would be delayed so why complain now, yes it is akward for some people to get the book, but the hardback edition will keep its value fairly well if you want to sell it a couple of years down the line. I currently own 2 hardcopies of the book (an intention to keep one pristine and hopefully geta an autograph) and I still will buy the ebook for portability of the entire series.
B000000XB9|5.0|This truly is a greatest hits album.  There are so many catchy tunes.  I am very satisfied with this CCR greatest hits album.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Great cute puzzle game. If you enjoy cut the rope and those block sliding puzzle games you will love this! I always let my gf test games before I play them and if she likes them they are keepers lol.
B000002GF8|4.0|There are some really good songs on this album, but some of them, I was just not into.  This was a breakthrough album for the police and should be in anyones Police album collection though.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Whether this is your 1st time seeing this series or you've followed it from the very beginning, you're going to freak over Season 2!! I didn't think that they would/could do a comparable season from season 2 to season 1 but let me tell you, season 2 is JUST as freakin' awesome as season 1.  Get the entire series if you can. It will definitely be the most watched of all shows!
B000001F3C|5.0|I still have the songs in this album in my head constantly.  I have this in my rotation of CDs I play on the way to work, and it is an enjoyable listen.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Will never tire of the Big Bang. I watch it every night especially when there is nothing else on television
B006O6F932|5.0|es mas grande de lo que nos imaginabamos y el precio mejor que en tienda, lo recomiendo para niñas de 8 años en adelante
B0076DELIG|4.0|I have read all of Michael Connelly's books and this is another good Bosch mystery.  Hard to put down.  Can't wait for another one!
B000O8OTNC|4.0|I haven't had the privledge of using this tool yet.  The tool is made with quality materials and I expect it to last.<br />UPDATE, I have used this tool several times and I highly recommend it.
B0031RS2XG|5.0|I don’t usually write reviews of books, even good ones, but Made to Stick is so good I feel the need to make an exception.<br /><br />It is, quite simply, one of the best non-fiction books I have ever read – definitely in my top five, possibly top three.<br /><br />I won’t reiterate the main content: I can see other reviewers have done that. But I will say that the power of the book’s ideas combined with its clear, readable and lively presentation (“let’s skip now to another timeless and beautiful domain of expression: accounting”) make for one helluva package. This is one of those few books where I’ve bought both the hard copy as well as the Kindle version. That’s how good it is.<br /><br />While it’s still early days for me in applying the very practical lessons in Made to Stick they hold great promise in yielding high impact in thought leadership, providing learning, and marketing effectively. One example: I recently drafted an article for submission to a training magazine that has previously published half a dozen of my articles. Before I submitted it however, having just finished reading Made to Stick I ran the article through the author's checklist and made some changes (notably, creating some story-like case studies on which to hang the article, filling out my examples more concretely, and ensuring the core, simple idea came through clearly) and then submitted it. The editor’s response - on the same day I submitted it - was “…I wasn’t going to edit this today but once I started reading I could not stop…”  As I say, very promising…<br /><br />There’s tremendous breadth in the areas you can apply the lessons in from Made to Stick: my interests range across learning and development, strategy, and marketing, and Made to Stick applies powerfully to each of these. But there are applications across all of business, government and not-for-profits, as well as if you’re a parent, an employee or anyone wanting to make an impact!<br /><br />One of the book’s real gifts for me was in sensitising me to my audience’s ‘higher’ motivations, rather than just baser or more selfish appeals (the authors refer to this as ‘getting out of Maslow’s basement’). This nicely reflected my underlying – but hitherto undeveloped – approach, enabling me to speak more authentically and forcefully, with greater resonance for my readership and clients.<br /><br />Another of the book’s great gifts for me was in teaching how to correctly use mental visualisation to solve problems and improve performance, in a nice and much-needed contrast to the pop-psychology and self-help gurus (The Secret – this means you!). This is a good thing to get at any time of the year, but especially when setting goals for the new year. And all of Made to Stick’s assertions are soundly backed by credible and solid academic research. Who would have thought you’d get all this in a book about communicating more clearly!<br /><br />The other terrific aspect of Made to Stick is its legacy in inviting people to look for stories in their own lives and experience. Stories play a key role in making ideas sticky - they’re concrete, credible and more memorable than straight facts: ‘facts tell, stories sell’. The authors emphasise that you don’t even have to create stories at all; rather, become a story spotter: just recognise when life is giving you the gift of a story to use. Nice.<br /><br />I may sound like I’m on commission for sales of Made to Stick (regrettably this is not so) but I am very enthusiastic about what this compact and considered book has to offer.<br /><br />Here’s my sticky recommendation: buy not one, not two, but three copies of this book: one for work, one for home, and one to keep in the glovebox of the car (so you can read it at the red traffic lights). And then join with me in lobbying the Gideons to place a copy in every motel room…/><br />One of the book’s real gifts for me was in sensitising me to my audience’s ‘higher’ motivations, rather than just baser or more selfish appeals (the authors refer to this as ‘getting out of Maslow’s basement’).

B0036EH3XE|5.0|Five stars because it is the best show ever and the DVDs came in perfect condition. LOST IS AWESOME!!! I NEVER watched ANY Lost episodes when it was actually ON TV. I didn't &#34;buy into&#34; the hype at all. I didn't watch a SINGLE episode EVER until 2012 after two years of my new husband begging me to watch it. He had season 1 and 2 already on DVD so I told him &#34;I'll watch it someday&#34; and I just never did until last fall. I told my daughters ages 13 and 16 to watch it with us which they REALLY didn't want to do but I told them to watch just a few episodes and if they hate it then they don't have to watch it ever again. Well, they got hooked by at least the second episode and now we're on Season 3 about halfway through so we haven't gotten past that yet but we will. My 13 year old BEGS me to watch it so we usually have &#34;Lost&#34; marathons until it's time for bed but since my ex husband and I have shared 50/50 custody I don't see my kids but every other week so that's why it's taking so long to watch them. We LOVE it SOOO much and cannot wait to watch more of season 3 tomorrow night. My 13 year old actually has started watching them over again because I won't let her watch any episodes we haven't seen yet until everyone is together and has time to watch them. It's everyone's favorite show even though it's over now. We will be VERY very depressed and sad once they are over. We watched all three seasons of Kyle XY too on DVD and they LOVED that too. I recommend that show also...a very different show but still VERY good...horrible ending though since they didn't know they were getting cancelled when they filmed it. Anyway, I cannot recommend LOST highly enough!!! You will LOVE it!!!!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|As with 2, mom loved this book also and is sad the series is over (shhhh I know there are others). As a non-reader, she plowed through this series in a month. Now to get her hooked on Game Of Thrones...
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Beautiful songs and sounds. Lovely duets with some of the most popular singers today. This album is a great addition to your Christmas collection.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It was well written, humorous, and the action was above par. It's not a 'Keeper' like the first but well worth 2 hours of your life to watch.
B002CPD5LC|5.0|Great products. I would recommend these to people everywhere..  Thanks for the opportunity to order on line.  Look forward to more good buys.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved this book, a little slower than the previous 2 but great ending to this awesome series. Worth the buy
B00628RVV0|5.0|I had to stop watching the movie to go to the dentist and another appointment, but resumed to see the last fiv minutes as soon as I got home.  Despite the subject matter, this was a very well made film that really drew you in and kept you riveted to see what happens to the main character.  I didn't want it to stop when the end came, but I understand why the film makers did what they did.
B00005JPCF|5.0|Very informative film concerning the plight of penquins, It was very enjoyable viewing entertaining for kids and adults. One of my favorite movies.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The perfect second book of yet another great book (The Hunger Games), well done Collins! Can't' t wait for Mockingjay!
B009CPJHY4|3.0|its  an okie dokie movie..not so great ...can be watched just once....or may be my choice is  not so good
B0054X3FQO|4.0|\\"Just living is not enough,\\" said the butterfly, \\"one must have sunshine, freedom and a little flower.\\"<br />  ~Hans Christian Andersen<br /><br />Beauty is more than skin deep for Miranda Kerr, supermodel, activist, wife, mother and now author of the book Treasure Yourself.<br /><br />One word about the book - awesome!  Why?<br /><br />Have you ever met anyone you felt was an \\"old soul\\"?<br /><br />Kerr is just that, an \\"old soul\\".  She is someone who seems to have wisdom, knowledge and advice beyond her years.<br /><br />She is a mere 27 years-old, absolutely grounded, and someone who has discovered the key to empower herself and others.<br /><br />She reminds us, like flowers, each woman is as unique as a new bud flowering into bursting colors of red, orange, white and pink.<br /><br />Kerr is able to excel at simply wrapping her arms around many other souls with her own words and affirmations.<br /><br />As an \\"old soul\\" beauty, I find Kerr's affirmations are like a graceful flower filled with fragrant clusters of  humbleness and gratitude.  You can easily sense how she's accomplished this beauty and grace with one of the several affirmations she created:<br /><br />  \\"i am an incredible human being.  everyday by my thoughts and feelings i create who i am for myself.  i create `me' today and tomorrow and i am happy with my creation.  i am whole, complete and perfect just as i am.\\"<br /><br />Throughout this book, Kerr respectfully honors current inspirational teacher's works.  Their work has provided her a safety net to blossom on her own.<br /><br />Yes, she's a model for high-profile runway shows and fashion beauty shoots, but she reminds us that she didn't get there overnight.<br /><br />She had to grow up faster than most of us and this affirming book is an example of her survival.<br /><br />Experience the insight Kerr provides in this table-top or carry-in-your-pocketbook reusable affirmation guide to blossom where you are.<br /><br />To an \\"old soul\\" beauty like a butterfly in flight, fly, Miranda, fly.<br /><br />I send you my love, blessings and wishes for a prosperous and abundant life!<br /><br />(I was not financially compensated for this post.  I received the book from Hay House for review purposes. The opinions are completely my own based on my experience.  I am also an affiliate of Hay House Publishing and Amazon.)
B003UPPO2G|5.0|The whole process was painless from start to finish.  The DVD came in no time and was in great shape.
B005LAII8K|5.0|...are there so many negative reviews on such a stellar movie?  I've seen lesser films receive better treatment.  Also, what's with the insanely positive reviews and *only* 4 stars?  If you are that sold on a movie, then just give the thing a 5.  I guarantee you won't lose any sleep over it.  Trust me on this.<br /><br />Anyhow, Prometheus this is not.  It's one of the rare sci-fi gems that stand out as being both coherent and something you can identify with; it runs the gamut of human emotion and nature while still presenting us with a collage of fictional events that, when all put together, seem believable.<br /><br />Joseph Gordon-Levitt delivers an impeccable showing as a young Joe, realistically depicting the simultaneously gritty and prosaic life of a Mafia hitman in the future, and the consequences that such a profession entails, namely when he meets his future self (Bruce Willis).  Of particular note is Pierce Gagnon, who manages to deliver in a stirring and somewhat unnerving role as Cid, a child with extraordinary telekinetic power.  It is this performance that will cement Gagnon's place in a line of up-and-coming child actors.<br /><br />Overall, a seemingly perfect blend of gunplay, thematic elements, and great acting comes together to make this feature a staple in any movie connoisseur's collection.
B001GCUNWQ|4.0|This was bought for my two grandsons to watch while they are at our house.<br /><br />They watch these when they come over to visit.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great book, I couldn't put it down. Suspenseful and not predictable. I gave it four stars instead of five because the end left me unsettled, without going into detail!<br />I will read more of her novels
B005LAIISA|4.0|This was bought for my two grandsons to watch while they are at our house.<br /><br />They watch these when they come over to visit.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This book is deep at times but in the end it has one important point to it throughout.<br /><br />Read it and your doubts may just disappear.
B004DM0UII|5.0|I'm not much for internet radio, but a free one that give you TONS of options?  Pretty awesome!  Thanks for making it free Amazon!
B001NHNG64|5.0|I read a different Jack Reacher story first. I enjoyed the style and characters so much, I Goggled the author and started reading the series from the beginning.  I have not been disappointed.  These books are about an ex-military guy who finds himself in odd situations where his training is paramount to his survival.
B003K16PFU|3.0|George Orwell paints a picture of his time in Spain during the Spanish Civil War so vividly that it feels like a fictional narrative.  I felt the book was self-indulgent and dragged on at times, but few authors could have detached themselves from their situation enough to give such an unbiased picture.

B00571F26Y|5.0|Very well-researched and excellent information. After having my twins, I found that the ONLY healthy (& effective) way to lose the pregnancy weight was by ditching the grains.<br /><br />Didn't know all of the issues with wheat specifically, but so glad that I do now. As soon as I finished this book, my twin toddlers and I became wheat-free . . . and to tell you the truth, it really hasn't been difficult. Since we eat primarily whole foods anyway and are very careful w/ our diets, the only issues we have are when we go to a family member's house.<br /><br />It's been a couple of weeks and I've lost the extra 5 lbs I put on during the holidays--and my head feels clearer. Not sure if the twins have experienced any positive effects yet (they are 2 years old), but it makes me feel good to know that by ditching the whole wheat in their diets, I'm no longer feeding them such inflammatory foods . . . foods that can potentially lead to dozens of chronic health issues.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I cannot believe how much  I loved this book I couldn't put it down. I would recommend to anyone. Absolutely amazing.
B00456PKG4|3.0|A fairly enjoyable film, especially considering the poor quality of most video games come movie. Worth the 2 dollar rental.
B009G7WUME|4.0|This review is about the vinyl only since you already know you like the music if you are buying it nearly 20 years later.  The TL;DR is that you should buy this because it sounds great.  For more in-depth info:  There is the typical RTI silver circle sticker for HQ-180 Premium Vinyl Pressing, and a hype sticker including \\"180-Gram Vinyl Cut from the Original Analog Master\\".  It comes in a loose, perforated and reusable outer bag.  The record sits in an unlined inner-sleeve (not in a nice poly sleeve like most RTI HQ-180s), which means that it got quite scuffed up on the journey to me.  It didn't help that the packer at Amazon decided to put this in a giant box with no packing material instead of their awesome LP mailer, which resulted in bent and crushed corners (I'll be exchanging)! There are also the typical QC issues from the past few years like the spindle hole was drilled slightly off-center causing some pitch problems on the last 2 tracks of side B, and the vinyl had finger prints and surface scuffs, and a half-inch scratch all the way down You Oughta Know (which turned out to be inaudible).  To nit-pick the mastering, there is a fair amount of sibilance and some pre/post-echo in quiet parts and between tracks.  Like I said, however, all of this is just nit-picking because it sounds so amazing both with headphones and speakers that you don't really notice.  One last thing- this does NOT include the You Oughta Know remix that is a hidden track on the CD.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It stinks<br />B<br />ryce joke about the party of Canada and Mexico city council and Mexico city council and pick up the party of Canada and pick up the good work with the party of Canada and pick up the good work with the party of Canada and pick up the good work with the party of Canada and pick up the good work with the party of Canada and pick up the good work with the party of Canada and pick up the good work with the party of Canada and pick up the good of a backdrop to James Coneythe call to action in the party
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Very predictable, glad it was a short read as I felt at times it would never end. But it was a good chick flick that I rarely read so I enjoyed it for that reason.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Flynn doesn't disappoint. When most authors have run the course with their characters, Flynn continues to keep Rapp, et al, fresh and timely. I will continue to read the series and I look forward to the next chapter.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Spys, safe houses, terrorists on the loose! Even better than Clancy if you can imagine that. Be glad that Mitch Rapp is on our side. Vince Flynn books keep me up all night. I love reading them.
B00000K2W1|3.0|I very much like two songs from in this CD but I guess I really don't like her as much as I thought.  Not the CD's fault.  Some of the songs are kind of low grade.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|These 3 books kept me wanting more. Im so upset there is no more. E l. James your amazing writer. I sure hope she writes more.
B000V8A95C|5.0|I'm assuming you're here because you've either seen or heard Wicked, so you don't need to be convinced about how awesome it is. I don't really know what to review for this product. The sound quality is great. Just get it.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|Got this for Xmas and it is incredible! No damage to the box and fast shipping. Sister is scared of it but I love it.
B0047WJ11G|4.0|I bought this on a sale that Amazon was having, and it was my first Amazon instant video. What I didn't know is that the ONLY way to watch it is through Amazon Instant Video. You can't download it to your computer, you can't burn it to a DVD, and you can't access it without an internet connection. Feels like you're not really &#34;buying&#34; a product, but &#34;renting&#34; access to it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is the first app that I love but can you please tell me how to  get the cheet to make my guy different
B001I45UFC|5.0|This book will forever hold a special place in my heart. It was one of the first books I read and now I just read it to my 6 year old son 27 years later. He loved it!
B003O86FMW|4.0|This is a wonderful sequel to The Hunger Games.  It keeps you turning the pages and connecting g with the characters even more.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|absolutely love this game it is sooo fun I play it more than my kids the only issue I have with this app is not getting updates and it continues to erase all my stuff coins characters everything there has to be a way to fix that it has happened to me like 3 times already other than that i love this game
B008LVCKH6|5.0|Lots of black humour! This is a wonderful romp through history as well as a comical story set in the current time. Very clever writing and plotting. I look forward to seeing the movie version.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I can't believe this is a best seller. It truly is the biggest wast of money. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|Emma<br />I enjoy Jan Austen, reading these books over and over.  You can never tire of a truly well written book like her writing of Emma.

0345803493|5.0|Ur going to love it!! I did!!! I read it twice!! I just couldnt get enough og christian and anne
B007IK44CK|5.0|This movie is the best Tom Cruise movie to come out in a long while. It never takes itself too seriously and yet has the chops of a good action movie.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|Loved the way that this movie was so faithful to the original series and graphic novel. It took me back to the first time I read it and brought forth all the same emotions. Great job all round and I highly recommend it for any fan of the Dark Knight.
B0058YPL66|5.0|I loved watching the first season of Once Upon a Time and wanted to review it before the start of the second season.  It is fascinating to watch.  I have always loved fairy tales, but this one has a modern spin to it and is meant for older children and adults.
B009GIPDQS|2.0|This was the weakest of the maybe six John Grisham novels I've read so far. The very elaborate scheme drawn-up by the main character works too perfectly to be credible while the government officials whom he targets end up looking like clueless fools.
B0088XXCZ6|3.0|No song stands out, nor does the album have any memorable songs or meaning.<br />I say skip it and let's see what she does next.
B000V39KDO|5.0|If you like action movies this is a great one. Its a good action movie that's not overflowing with all kinds of mushy stuff like most are. Just has a lot of fighting scenes with lots of blood and guts.
1932100660|5.0|You will forever change your eating habits after reading this book .  Americans eat way too much meat, and the body just functions better eating less meat, more vegetables.  The price of prosperity brings a lot of benefits, but  there is a way to have the best of both worlds by making smarter choices.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Wish it could go on for ever.it was so good and the acting was perfect, believable, and the visuals are a site for sore eyes
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Good read. Keeps you entertained as well on the edge with the intriguing and confusing lifestyle of Mr. Christian Grey.

B003ODIZL6|2.0|Thanks for the great book, but I don't think that I'll be trying to read it all. Thanks anyway for this book.
B0031RS2HC|5.0|Lee child just gets better with every read the story was fast and full of action. It was a great read which filled in some of reachers past family once again.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Great book. Highly encourage you to read it. I could not put it down. If your looking for a good love story check it out.
B001VLXNLU|5.0|I gave this book a five star rating due to the fact that it's just an astonishing book. Every aspect of this book/series is amazing and completely drags you in. I got hooked with in first chapter which incredible because it takes a lot to get me interested p.c. cast and Kristen cast did an outstanding job writing the series that I definitely recommend it to everyone!
B007SGM084|5.0|I can't put it down...Ladies, this really gets you going in so many ways (if you know what I mean).  It leaves nothing to the imagination.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Anyone who wants a different perspective on life, read this book. It's inspirational. Charlie is the greatest character and so dynamic, do yourself a favour and buy it.
B003K16P3M|5.0|I devoured this and was instantly hooked. *****! (FIVE STARS) The relationship between Katsa and Po was very well developed and I loved the book.

B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Diary of a wimpy kid is hilarious.  I nor my brother can put it down. I was very absorbed in its detail
0143119419|4.0|I've been looking forward to reading this book for some time and I think any serious student of stock market history should enjoy this read. Basically it's a summary of the conquests from history's movers and shakers in the hedge fund world. If you watch the markets at all some of these people should be quite familar to you. This book doesn't really come up new information about the hedge fund manager's techniques but it's a great summary. In summary, this is a very good summary of biggest names in the hedge fund world and worth your time to read if you are really into stock market history.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I'm not all the way through this one yet but I love all his books in this series.. He really keeps your attention..
B00AA7O22U|1.0|Lots of bad cameos and bad acting by old action heros.  So bad it was if they did not care. The only plus was lots of action.
B008BIN9EW|5.0|This is my favorite android game.  Playing it is more fun than humans s hould have (I always play as the robotic race TITANS).
B009MO57H6|5.0|This movie was great!!!  We are a fan of the series, this was really intense and exciting.  You can watch this over and over again.  I hope they keep these movies coming!!!!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This story is not only facinating but is an example of human decency as well as an influence of God
B009MF5BXK|5.0|I love seeing all the old action heroes.  It was weird that Mickey Roake wasn't in it.  Jean Claude seemed to forgot how to act or his lines were being fed to him. But everyone else was funny and really kept you interested.  I hope they come out with Expendable 3.
B0045LSIRM|5.0|Anything by Bryan Adams is great.  I attended his Bare Bones concert in Sioux Falls, SD at the Washington Pavillion.  It was an amazing night.  This CD brought back some great memories of that night.
B0083DJWGO|5.0|Antifragile is a brilliant essay on how randomness shapes our lifes, how any prediction is vain, and develop the very interesting concept of antifragility, contrary of fragile to handle situations in which what do not kill us makes us much better.<br />Must read !
B007QPFGJW|5.0|An excellent addition to the continuing saga of Harry Hole, one of the more human principal characters among the many series I enjoy.  I eagerly await the next installment.
034580404X|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my wife. She loved it needless to say. To all the guys out there, if your wife is reading these books, there is a good chance a certain aspect of your life is going to get better......... or weird, depending how your partner takes the book.
1469273802|5.0|Awesome book and well done. Another great book in this series. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys Tom Clancy novels.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|this is a cute game,nothing like angry birds it tend to be confusing because there are no instructions on how to play
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This book makes history interesting and instructive for us today.  I think of my grandparents who were children during this time and my grandfather who was injured fighting the war. I think about our soldiers fighting for us now and the many innocent people around the world who are victims of political unrest.  I look forward to reading all the trilogy.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I really enjoy this game. quite time consuming but fun to play. I like the way you are actually able to see what's going on. That makes it more interesting.
B009NQLT0M|5.0|I replaced a 3 year old stock 40mm fan with this one, and WOW! The other one was so loud I had to unplug it until this new fan came in. When I powered up this new fan, pure silence.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Read the book in one day- I bought all three of the Hunger Games books for my Kindle and loved it. Go Suzzane! Fantastic books.
B0063IH60K|1.0|I deleted this game from my Kindle. There were way too many advertisements to have to watch get to the game.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Read the book in one day- I bought all three of the Hunger Games books for my Kindle and loved it. Go Suzzane! Fantastic books.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It definitely had a strong \\"Harry Potter\\" like feel to it in that there is a whole other type of people that have unique abilities.  I did like the author's writing style and the thing with the old-fashioned pictures was fun.  I would highly recommend reading this for fans of the genre.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Of course, I had to read this book because everyone was. I suppose this was supposed to help women find out different ways to have sex, but the books was slow and dull. I felt like I was reading a contract over and over again. I didn't find it thrilling-- just another raunchy porno for women. Sorry, guys. I wasn't impressed. Back to reading Nora Roberts and Danielle Steel.
B000SEGUDE|3.0|This is an interesting book and a couple of the characters really grow on you.  All the hype from the movie based on the book talked about \\"everything is connected\\", but it's kind of a stretch on how everything is connected... it's sort of like playing 6-degrees of separation from Kevin Bacon and using that as the means to conclude that he's in every movie.  The main problem I had with it was the strange narrative with cryptic language from different time periods for some of the characters.
0375850864|5.0|This is a textbook that I needed for class. I haven't read the book yet, but the book I did buy was in perfect condition and it shipped quickly. I supposed I'll edit my review once I read the entire book. It looks very interesting.
0060825456|5.0|This book has been a huge hit with my students---okay, with myself, too. Even my kids who &#34;hate to read&#34; like this one.
B0018RFLN0|4.0|Had watched this movie back when it was first released and enjoyed it. I was a fan of the old TV series and this was a good takeoff from that series, starting with \\"Mr Phelps\\" a character name taken from the TV show. By todays standards the technology was a bit dated but the story line was good. Worth watching especially if your a Prime member as its free for now.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|One of the best post apocalyptic stories I have read. I would recommend this book to everyone. Please write more of these.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|I recieved this movie on time and in great condition! An Awesome movie, very funny!!  Will Ferrell is hilarious! Few innapropriate parts for young children, but otherwise a good family movie.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|The soundtrack is great.  The songs are perfect and the timing with the new season is even better! Thanks !
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Never thought I would love romance novels but this book had me hooked in the first chapter. It reminds me of the \\"fifty shades\\" trilogy. Not as kinky but definitely the same love story. Good book regardless!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Fantastic book! It's one of those books that you don't want to put down, and when you have to, you can't wait to pick it back up again! Excellent!
0765325950|5.0|I have to say that it was worth the wait. I don't know that all the strings were tied up, but the major ones were. I'm going to re-mourn Jordan's death though. I'd like to ask him a question or two about the futures of some of the characters. Another review said that it would have been nice to have more of an epilogue, I can see the point, but the quotes you find at the end tie in very well with how Jordan started his books. It's more akin to \\"happily ever after\\" than something telling you what happens to everyone.<br /><br />If you've been waiting for this book since the beginning it's a reward for your faithfulness, if you abandoned the series during the more meandering volumes, then the end is a good reason to pick them back up.
B000N7KTBU|4.0|Worked and was discovered immediately by Windows.  My only gripe is that I have to remove both ends to get the drive out.  I needed to use this as a temporary housing to recover some data off a failing hard drive.
B00003CX9W|1.0|This was a gift for Xmas. I am now informed that it is not recognized by a DVD player or a computer. It appears to be a defective product. Would you replace it with a working product ?
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Good quality amazing price.<br />No bonus just the movie.<br />So if you like the extras this will not be the best Harry potter collection for you. But if you're like me, this is amazing!
B008602KQI|5.0|This pretty much is awesome.  Fun and not too bad for the whole family to watch.  I look foward to the rest of the series.
B003E1D54K|5.0|I purchased this book for my daughter as a Christmas gift. She loves it. It is nice to have an original volume in such good condition.
0811806405|4.0|I bought this book because I wanted to learn how to make guitars. It is a great reference to it and some of the techniques are helpful. However, it seems to assume a lot of things. It assumes that you are not new to wood working, or that you have access expensive tools. I also wish that it covered more about types wood that could have been alternatively used like maple for necks or red cedar for tops. Overall, it is a good start for beginnners.
B0085TKAW6|5.0|Another brilliant story from Ken Follett. Only downside is having to wait another 2 years for next installment!!<br />I always get completely absorbed by the characters he creates.
B004T3AUE0|4.0|I bought WWZ first and loved it so much I bought this which is a prequal. There is some good practical advice on here,hopefully we never have to use it!
0765325950|4.0|Deep breath, I am done! This was a sixteen year journey for me, and I can't count how many times I have read and reread this series. I went from a high school teenager to a dad in the time it took for the final book to be published. My reasons for liking the series have changed drmatically over the years as well. Characters I vehemently despised when younger are now seen with new eyes. This was an odd realization, and I think it has also warmed me to the last book in the series. Anything that lasts this long, and touches so many different areas is bound to have some ups and downs, but this book tied many things up for me, and was done, as well as could be done since the creator's passing.<br /><br />I wish there was more closure on many plot points, but I am happy with what I got.
0739366408|5.0|This is great entertainment. I listin to audiobooks at work and I couldn't get enough of these short stories of post zombipocalypse  experiences. You will also here some very familiar voices reading the stories,I won't spoil it for you,just buy it if your thinking about it,its the best!!
B00867GHS8|5.0|Finding Nemo is a story that everyone would love. Makes my Hubby and I feel like kids again. 3D makes the underwater adventure so much better.
B000OCZD5G|3.0|when this came out  it was uncut and the old vhs was uncut, but for some reason when it was put on dvd it was chopped up to get an R rating and plot and violence was cut from it and this master has been used on every dvd on the planet although there seems to be a japanese version that was the uncut print but dont know if this story is true,  so its up to you buy this cut version or wait and find out  if a definitive print comes along using an uncut version of the film, who knows with this new movie coming out they may release the full unedited print
1423124111|5.0|If you are any fan of Disney, I can't recommend this book highly enough. I just got this book today in the mail and I'm extremely impressed. The book is a large size so as to best present the poster art. The posters themselves cover Disney parks throughout the world and through the decades. They are printed in vivid colors so that the posters seem to almost jump off the page. Each chapter, which covers a different land or park begins with a short introduction. The book itself begins with a very nice introduction as well. The posters of the Disneyland Railroad on pages 18 and 19 are just fantastic and again jump off the page. I'm very happy with this book. If you've ever visited a Disney park and admired the posters advertising the various attractions, I'm sure you'll like this book too.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|So as I was reading the reviews I kept coming across a few recurring themes as to why people don't like this game.. Let me save you some time and I'll sum it up for you now..<br /><br />1. This game doesn't work on my kindle or I can't make it work.<br />I don't know if this was before it came on kindle, if it has a problem downloading on some people's kindle or if it's a user error or not, but it's fine on my kindle..<br /><br />2. I don't like this game because my kid spent $200 in gems, food, and the coins that you get like every 5 mins in the game anyways.<br /> Well, there's parental controls that you can enable to avoid this, it isn't the game's fault. Personally I feel you're a fool if you allow your child to play unsupervised with your credit card unchecked. Really guys?? Parent! Watch your children! Use common sense!<br /><br />3. This game makes me wait if I don't want to buy gems.<br />I have over 50 dragons, 35 different varieties, and probably about 10 rare ones and all I've spent is a $2 credit kindle gave me soon after I got my kindle fire. So wait. It's a game of patience and chance. It's fun because you don't know what you'll get. While you're waiting decorate your park. Go outside. Watch tv. Parent those children that are dipping into your bank account unsupervised. Or spend the money. Personally I believe that Backflip (the developers) deserve $2-$3 for such a great game.<br /><br />I have the kindle fire hd and I think this game has great graphics, it's a very cool concept, and its just a lot of fun to pass the time here and there. I've played it quite a bit, I'm level 18, and I also love their Army of Darkness game.. 5 stars, 2 thumbs up, whatever saying you need to know this is a great game!!!<br />Hope this review helps everyone. Happy breeding!
B0060MYM3S|5.0|If nudity offends you, you probably should not watch it. Because not an episode goes by that does not contain some. But the story lines are great. You always want to see what happens next. All the characters cause you to either love or hate them.<br />Peter Dinklage is hilarious as Tyrion Lannister.
B0085TKAW6|4.0|Great sequel to Fall of Giants, can't wait til book 3 is released.<br />I was disappointed that the book had to end.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|wasn't as good as the first two, but enjoyable to watch with the great effects throughout this movie.  would recommend to watch.
0316069434|3.0|As other reviewers have noted, this is a book for Harry Bosch fans, because it is the \\"same ole Harry.\\"  As usual, Harry wants justice for victims and he takes a 20-year old case from its beginning to finally its end.  Harry Bosch fans will recognize how he  picks at a small thread until the case finally unravels.<br /><br />As usual, Harry finds himself in political trouble which is not a surprise since  he is a nonconformist and abhors authority.  In addition, he again ends up with trouble in his love life because he always chooses women with issues.  As a reader who lives Harry's life vicariously, I was, however, pleased to observe that the relationship with his teen-aged daughter is developing very well.<br /><br />If you like to visit with an old friend, this is the book for you.  Hopefully, you have read THE DROP prior to reading this book as some of the events dovetail from that novel.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|loved this movie, highly enjoyable throughout the movie. would recommend this movie to anyone that is interested in buying this.
B0084AZXKK|4.0|A nice good short read. Not at all challenging but still fun. A adventure for a younger crowd I suppose.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|highly enjoyed this movie from start to finish. I would recommend this movie to anyone who has watched all batman movies.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book. I wasn't able to predict the ending which made me appreciate it all the more.
B009MF56GC|1.0|for some unknown reason this movie wouldn't play for me. I order blu-ray movies on line all the time, and this is the first time it has asked for &#34;check region&#34;.  Not recommended for australian viewers.
B009V3KKXY|5.0|This book is great with lots of a good pics!! Great for anyone interested in paracord crafts and for any outdoors man or survivalist!
1426308469|5.0|got this book for my son's 5th birthday. Their are so may pictures and it's very colorful. he sits with this book and just flips through the pages and makes up his own stories, but we read it to him at night before bed. He loves dinosaurs! a great buy for a dinosaur lover.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|My kids can't put this down.  My son is six and he is enjoying it all, every day.  Thank you~
6305388458|5.0|Not as funny the 2nd time around because there is lots of slapstick, but still worth seeing again. xxxxx xxx
B007M45PMU|5.0|And at 5 bucks. Got it!! I had just been listening on YouTube, but it transferred right into my iTunes after purchase!!
B0039208JE|3.0|Tim Burton's \\"Batman\\" was undoubtedly the film that started it all.... It was not just a groundbreaking film...but a film that set the tone and mood for what many consider to be the essence of Batman as both an established character and a pop culture Icon. It also green lighted the astonishing Batman: the animated series which dominated the ratings through the early to mid 1990s. It has great performances from the ensemble cast, great set design and use of backlot, but fails to deliver an intricate and complex plot and story that are worthy of the Dark Knight's reputation as a film hero and well known comic book character.<br /><br />The Good:<br />-Excellent Visual Effects (The Batmobile, Bat-Suit, Bat-Wing; Anton Furst's Gotham City---which gives the view a feeling of being in an dangerous, vile, retched and scary place)<br />-Excellent Performances (Keaton's Batman is subtle and mysterious, Nicholson's Joker is hilarious and sinister, Basinger's Vicki Vale is excellent and optimistic)<br />Jack Palance gives an excellent performance as Carl Grissom, a feared mob boss<br />Billy Dee Williams is great as Harvey Dent (He should have been Two-Face)<br />Robert Whul's Alexander Knox provides good exposition, and some comic relief<br />Pat Hingle's Commissioner Gordon is good (despite his lack of screen time)<br />Michael Gough's Alfred is subtle and noteworthy in the film--provides stability and balance to Keaton's reclusive Bruce Wayne<br />Gough's Alfred is very consistent with the comics--especially with his subtle use of emotion in his performance<br />Great songs by Prince!!!!<br />Burton's Film as a whole establishes and maintains that dark, gritty, \\"gothic\\" feel that we all know and love from the comics and the beloved animated series that came after it.<br /> Despite all of those great things that this film gives viewers and its ablity to stand the test of<br />time (this film is 22+ years old and I still find it entertaining), This film does have its flaws.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />-Several Plot Holes!!!<br />-Why does the Joker Fall hard for Vicki Vale? (yes, she's gorgeous, but still....WTF?)<br />-Why does it take Batman So long to figure out that Axis Chemicals is the base of Joker's operations?<br />-Where was Alicia's Body? (She threw herself out of a window, right?)<br />-What was Vicki Vale's Photography/Journalism Background? (Yes, she did the Corto Maltisse, but that's it?)<br />-Why doesn't vicki have any reaction to Bruce Wayne being in the Bat-cave, and thus operating as Batman?<br />-Why does Batman show up at the museum, and then take off with vicki? was he just there to rescue her?<br />-Where did Joker steal $20 Million from? (It wasn't like he robbed banks? Right?)<br />Despite Michael Keaton's great performance, Burton and co. missed the point of his character. Batman operates as a non-lethal character, so why is he using his car to blow up Joker's factory with all of Joker's thugs and factory workers inside?<br />When Joker confronts Vicki Vale in her apartment, how is the cosmetic tray that Bruce uses able to block bullets?<br /><br />Overall, I'll try not judge this film too harshly, but invite you the viewer to draw your own conclusions. While this film is still entertaining and fun as it has always been--it is not the perfect \\"Batman\\" Film by any means.<br /><br />A solid, ground breaking film, not to be missed (if you haven't seen this film, you need to!)<br /><br />3 out of 5 Starsr /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />-Several Plot Holes!!!<br />-Why does the Joker Fall hard for Vicki Vale?

B005GTLPPY|5.0|This is NOT an advanced book, is for newbies. But if you're like me (a non-biologist) and want to find out the last theories on genetics, inheritance and the like this is a pretty solid title, not too dense, not too light.<br />I suppose there's a lot of speculation here and probably most of this stuff is still under review and discussion in cientific circles, but is good to know where we're standing in this field right now.
B009CPES4I|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this movie but my husband 'liked' it less than I did.  I wanted to see it - it's a light, fluffy movie, the type I like and the cast with Judi Dench and Maggie Smith, etc., included some of my favorite actors/actresses,
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Absolutely Wonderful! I loved the whole series. Captivating from beginning to end. I am very hopeful go out the movie.
B00979CS50|5.0|Another great album from Neil Young. Sound, no frills, honest, hand made guitar music. Every song is good on this double album. Looking forward to the next release!
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|I ordered this to complete my trilogy. Great quality product as well. I was very pleased with what was advertised and what I receivied.
0307720950|5.0|Crhis Anderson cross the lines of web, from bits to atoms!<br />It's a must have guide to anyone who wants to be a 21th century entrepreneur.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I love this story. The plot is unique yet the wit and humor are a signature of this author. Colleen Hoover is one of the best modern authors!
0316017930|5.0|There is not much to say about the book. .Condition was perfect. Shipping was ok. The book itself was pretty good reading. it opened up a new window to view success.I liked the book..
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|this is a great game very fun for a free app<br />you have to have jewels to purchase some things and to<br />  complete goals you can buy or earn jewels but they're<br />  kind ofbhard to earn
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I've tried a few different ones, but this one blows them away! Simple to navigate, cut, copy, etc. I would definitely recommend this app.
B002GIBVWA|5.0|Esta película es sencillamente adorable... Una de mis películas favoritas por toda la eternidad. El envío y la calidad del producto fueron excelentes...
B000VDDDY6|5.0|It is everything I hoped it would be I love Star trek,this brings back so many memories of went it was first shown on TV,hope to enjoy it for many years to come
B0021L8UPS|1.0|He comprado esta película 5 veces!!!!! Esperando que llegue bien. la caja, al igual que la portada siempre llega arrugada y rota... Pésima calidad.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Cute kids movie. My 4 yr old loves it. I really like dr Seuss. Came fast, and it was new. I have no complaints
B00006EXDM|5.0|My favorite Stones compilation,has all of my old time favorite hits. Went thru several of these vinyl albums in college, now i have it on CD.
0765325950|5.0|This has been the book I have been waiting for since I was in 9th grade, 10 years ago.<br /><br />It was great. Yes there are some loose threads not neatly tucked in, but I think RJ wanted it like that. Leaves more to the imagination and that breath of life of a real world...Also I think the outriggers were supposed to tie a few of those up buuuut we'll prolly never see those. But there is much we can assume.<br /><br />I highly recommend this novel, and this series. I had been an inspiration to me so many times and taught me more lessons than I probably will ever truly be able to count.<br /><br />I want to thank Mr Jordan, Mr Sanderson, and Mrs Harriet for creating and finishing this World of Dreams.<br /><br />My only complaint is from my greed of wanting more.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's perfect for all my basic computations, and has all the functions needed for my son's math class.  I like that it fills the screen with generously sized keys - fewer mistypes when entering numbers.
B009XY97VC|4.0|This isn't the best album from Two Steps from Hell, but its pretty good and definitely worth getting. What sort of detracts from this album is the singing. For some reason, its a distraction from the flow of the music. Its not that the singing is bad but to me it just seems through the flow off. Maybe because it is more than cinematic trailer music. In any case, I enjoy listening album and definitely shows that this group can create something more than just movie style music. I'm already looking forward for their next album.
B002LFAHBO|5.0|i love this movie and the condition was great! The picture is perfect and I am really satisfied with my purchase.
B001BPQT8A|5.0|Excelente la calidad y sonido para esta joya en BluRay, la edición es impecable y hermosa. Contiene bastante material adicional para una película ya de culto dentro del género. Un deber.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|I absolutely love pride and prejudice.  Of course I saw the movie first which I loved so I gave the book a shot and it is so much better then the movie though I will admit a bit hard to read for me.  Definitely glad I read it.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I would consider this book a must read for anybody who may be considering publishing a book for the kindle. First off, it's free so the only thing you might be out of is time if you don't like it. I found the tips in here extremely useful.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|What can one say - the Beatles. E\All the songs and memories wrapped up in a great collection - superb

B001GKJ2FW|5.0|We have watched the movie more than once. I am amazed at the talent of the stars of this movie.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book was absolutely enchanting. It makes me desperately want to run away with a circus! A must read! .
B0000C4LXG|5.0|Sharp beats and crushingly overdriven guitars puncuate this record in a way that almost defies you to like this record. Its dark and heavy and bleak and harsh and fantastic. It's also very interesting to see what bands followed the early black metal pioneers Bathory and Celktic Frost and what elements of their early sound helped to define the next generation of black metal bands.<br /><br />There is a lof of negativity that surrounds Mayhem, with one singer committing suicide (Dead) and Varg (Burzum) killing Euronomous, but their output speaks for itself without the drama.
B009JBZH54|5.0|The set arrived within the expected time.It's everything I had hoped for so I would recommend it to anyone wishing to purchase this product!
B0037VIBGY|5.0|Basically a one man acting showpiece, and Tom Hardy nails it. Bronson is the best British film I've seen in years.
B007MDB6L0|4.0|This movie was purchased for my young daughters.  They both loved it. Not surprising considering it is about tinker bell.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really liked it. The characters were interesting, there was lots of action. I loved the characters I was suppose to love and hated those I was suppose to hate.
0547884591|4.0|Have read the 4 Hour Body and am working on 4 Hour Work Week. Trying to glean what will work for me and my family.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I  liked this book. The characters were familiar. Katniss was a little whiny at times, but that is to be expected.
B003YL4KS0|5.0|It is really helpful on how to care for curly hair. To me , probably the best book out there. I'm African American and to me all hair need tlc and this book shows you how to care for, trim, and maintain curly hair. Frizz free!!:-)
B009YP9L7U|3.0|As far as free goes, not bad. All in all a fast,easy read for anyone looking for a little extra smut in their lives.

159420411X|4.0|It provided examples of why some models work and some do not. It performed as advertised. The author used personal examples which made a potentially dry topic interesting.
B00746O3X8|4.0|I love the Opteka system. I am a hiker and this thing saves the neck and shoulders.<br /><br />It would be nice if they would sell extra camera attachment screws so that I would not have to continuously be moving them from one camera to another. If they did I would rate a 5.<br /><br />The biggest bonus for me since I use the LowePro S&F harness and belt system is that both camera holsters can be easily adapted to the LowePro harness. Simply remove the Opteka harness strap and belt from the holster then clip the holster to the LowePro shoulder harness with a couple of S-biners and loop the bottom strap around the LowePro Harness to secure the bottom of the holster. There is no modification needed to either the LowePro S&F Harness/Belt or the Opteka MCH-25, you just need a couple of 25lb. Niteize S-biners. The second-camera holster can just be looped over the S&F belt in much the same way as it attaches to the MCH-25 belt. I don't know why LowePro didn't think of this as it is an elegant solution to an especially a heavy camera/lens situation such as the 70-200 f/2.8.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Fast read and hard to put down. This book was disturbing but wonderful.<br />Can't wait to read the next one.
006135323X|5.0|I got this book so I could learn more about marketing. I learned a lot. It is good for non-marketers, too. I would never have guessed that more choices actually turn customers OFF, for instance. This book explaines a lot about why we behave the way we do. It is very readable and hard to put down.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was really funny! Especially when the people laughed at Greg Heffley for wearing mom's winter coat! Can't wait for the next book to come out!!
B004EBZX6W|5.0|I use this on my phone and my Kindle Fire. I show people what networks are nearby and how strong they are. It helps in finding free channels for configuring networks and for choosing the best access point. It is simple to use and I have recommended it to friends and colleagues.
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|Never thought I would be so enthralled by this series.  Way to go Masterpiece Theatre. I'll order Season 3 asap.
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|Selling is integral to so much of our lives. Daniel Pink writes well and uses good stories to back up his points. He uses research to back up the stories and shows *why* things are true. I have learned a lot from this book and it is a fun read.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|Really grips you and keeps you coming back for more.  My husband and I talk about this series a lot.  Love it.
B004H4XI5O|5.0|This is NOT a &#34;how to win a memory contest&#34; or a &#34;how to remember everything&#34; book. It doesn't pretend to be either. It is a great story of Foer's journey. I learned a lot about Foer, Tony Buzan and others, as well as about learning how to improve my memory. I have not desire to participate in a memory contest, but it was fun to learn about Foer doing it.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|fawnda was go glad to receive this gift, she wanted the whole collection and loved the idea of it coming all together
B007V4530A|5.0|I have seen some amazing TED and TEDx talks (If you haven't, go check 'em out!). I teach and speak as part of my work. I want to improve my craft and I wanted to learn how those TED speakers did so well, so I bought this book. I bought it for my Kindle so I would have it available even when I was on the road. Good choice. Any speaker will learn from this book. So will anyone who just wants to give a good presentation at work. Do the &#34;Look Inside!&#34; and you will see that this book really does start at the beginning. It is encouraging while giving practical advice.,
B000ZOXDFA|5.0|I've shown this numerous times in my high school World History classes.  It makes a great transition between the Age of Discovery and Absolutism.  Students can identify her absolute powers and the influence that the race for new lands had on monarchs.  It is an engaging piece with drama, some action and superb costumes and settings.  I highly recommend.
B007FJFDXS|1.0|Display terrible on Kindle Fire.  Looks like 1980's lowres graphics.  And the game is boring.  On the other hand, it was free.
B005NJU8PA|2.0|There are a few good suggestions, tips, tricks, and pieces of advice in this book....but in order to find them, you have to suffer through Ferriss' grating ego, vague hand-waving about his ill-defined and probably fabricated system for learning things really fast, self-aggrandizement, and weird humor.  Perhaps others find him more charming than I do, but if you really want to learn the principles critical to becoming a self-reliant and expert cook, you can do so without the BS - buy Cooks Illustrated's The Science of Good Cooking, take a knife skills class, and read food blogs.
B008M36EEI|4.0|very enjoyable movie.  good chemistry for the 2 actors.  its light fare, but a nice romance.  learned about salmon and Yemen too
B008HK3XKO|5.0|Manware Vibe Standing case for Kindle Fire<br /><br />: Works great. Not too heavy either. i am very happy with this purchase.
1442353279|5.0|Arnold had everyting going against him after he landed here.  For him to go against all that and create such amazing success, is testament to this man and the power of believing in yourself.<br /><br />There really is not much I can't add that others havne't added. Don't be offput by the length of the book.  Arnold does NOT babble on. He simply has had an amazing life.  Honestly you can read half the book if you wish.  The real magic is the first half, where Arnold takes you along for a ride from his beginnings to how he made it in America.  It's almost like two books in one.<br /><br />DEFINATELY worth reading.  I am so glad Arnold wrote this book.  He is truly an inspiration and I now count him as an idol.  One man CAN work against the odds and achieve the American Dream if they believe in themselves (and have a great likeable personality too!).<br /><br />Must-buy.
1592537251|5.0|I did not what this book! But when I got it and was looking at it I love it! And get a lot of idels
0765325950|5.0|Great job Team Jordan.  5 stars!!!  For all those crying about the delay of the eBook.  Take it up with Tor, do not rate the book low.  It has nothing to do with the actual book.
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|I'm glad we finally found Goulding on this side of the pond.  I love her voice and the album plays well.  It's a consistent album on my mp3 player.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Although a little slow moving at times, a nice piece of historical fiction all the same.  Very well written and researched, believable characters and a satisfying ending.
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|Will this movie when Oscars- no, but overall, it was entertaining, intriguing in the ideas it posed and left me thinking, which I like in my movies.  Glad I added it to my collection.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|This book is very well written.  It is about a boy starting Junior High that has Severe Cranial Facial anomalies. I will not reveal the story are even how it is written because that will just take away from the element of surprise.<br /><br />I gave the book four stars because there are some things that are just not realistic. But then it is fiction so you can't expect perfection.<br /><br />My son has a cranial facial anomaly and it is nice to see something out there from this day and age. I appreciate Cher and her efforts and help with the cranial facial world. But the Movie  She was in is dated and we need to get material besides just information out there to help parents.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|and was very sad to know it is over.  The whole series was well written and had wonderful talent in the actors involved.  I know I will re-watch the triology many times.

B009VLX8FS|5.0|but after actually listening to her music, knowing she writes her own material, there is a honesty and beauty in her songs I find I really like.  It took me a while to warm up to her, but now, I listen to her regularly.  Keep up the good work Taylor!

B00A3AUGEW|5.0|I was happy when Phillips won American Idol.  He has a clean clear voice and AI for once didn't over do his vocals on the album.  Just plain, sweet singing.  I will look forward to his next album.
B000ICZD4I|5.0|It still never gets old! A great murder mystery and time flash back movie. Makes you realize that life is also precious!
B001FB0WBK|5.0|This is a must-see concert Dvd. When I tell people about Tommy Emmanuel, they often ask, \\"Who?\\" Once they've seen him live or on Dvd, they are instant fans. I've had the privilege of seeing him perform live and on several concert tapes; there aren't words to describe how good this guy is. I also met him backstage at two of his concerts and he is one of the warmest and most generous people I've ever met. A remarkable individual and talent.

B00914JWSW|3.0|I am a big fan of Barbara, but not crazy about this CD.  Also was not able to download on computer to add to iPod.<br />Just as well.  Not crazy about songs.  Disappointed about songs and the fact you can't download the CD.
B002OMZTSU|5.0|This really made you see what he had to go through to get where he is. He's a very good writer and his story telling makes you want to read more.
B00645LFA4|3.0|Just watched Shrek in 3D. Better than in 2D but I'm not sure if it was worth the extra money<br />being I already had it in 2D. It had vary good depth but nothing that jumped out of the<br />screen like you would be looking for in a 3D movie. Buy it if you like 3D depth but don't<br />look for any great out of screen surprise.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I would recommend this book to everyone who likes suspense and shocking discoveries this book is truly amazing very well put together but best of all had the most amazing story line ever  I was truly very well pleased with the whole series this series is something I would read over and over again and never get tired of it

B0085P2Z6E|3.0|Magic Academy :Hidden Castle is a game that had the potential to be fabulous.  Unfortunately it fell short.  Way, way short.  True, the game loaded with ease, and played without locking up, but after the first hour it began to feel like groundhogs day.  You keep returning to the same rooms to find the exact same objects!  SPOILER ALERT: keep track of where the green envelope, the scales, the glasses, and the hour glass are because you WILL be looking for them again....and again...and AGAIN.  My other major complaint about this game is that the story line was pretty much useless.  At no point in time are you given any option on where to go next or who you should seek out.  The creators could have saved themselves a lot of work and just gone with throwing together a bunch of hidden object games without a story. And while I hate to dissapoint the guys out there, I feel its only fair to warn you that the hot looking chick with the green eyes who is shown on the ad does NOT appear in the game,  but a bunch of butt ugly guys do. I suspect most of the creative team behind this game are of the male persuasion!  Anyway, I give the game 3 stars because I paid $2.99 for it and it definitely was a 99 cent game at best.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|THE PICSHOP App is one great photo editing and photo managing app. I STRONGLY recommend (if you love your photos) getting the free app and then upgrading it, it truly is worth the price.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|It works exactly how it should. Just a twitter app for kindle if you need one. Seems to work just fine.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I've been watching The Walking Dead on AMC and have become a big fan. I purchased this first volume to see how good the graphic novels are. I was impressed and very satisfied with the artwork. I don't normally read comics/graphic novels but I did enjoy it. I look forward to continuing with the series.
B000R7PYU2|5.0|I have buying the Rumpole books ever since I began watching the series with Leo McKern, therefore it's even easier for me to follow the books because I hear and picture them in my head.  Mortimer's stories have always been enjoyable and I will miss him.  Note:  The publishers forgot to take note that the first Rumpole novel was &#34;Rumpole's Return&#34; which was made into a film.
B001992NUQ|5.0|unopened fight club blue ray i bought everything was perfect...very happy with it thank you very much! Very excited to give this to my boyfriend when he gets home in a week...his fav movie!
1451695195|5.0|I love the fact that this is a temporal life - that we DO have a 'future' in spirit, and our connectivity to each other transcends this mortal coil...  It makes the struggles of this life... bearable.
0670026603|5.0|I was, to put it simply, blown away by this novel.  So strong, heart-felt, and amazingly well-written.<br /><br />I'd read an earlier novel by JoJo Moyes - \\"The Last Letter From Your Lover\\" - and thought it was good, but this book was outstanding.<br /><br />I've searched on Amazon and found a number of other books by the author available through used booksellers (some only outside the U.S.) and have just ordered a few of those titles.<br /><br />What I loved about \\"Me Before You\\" was that the characters are real and very, very interesting.  Also, I loved that the author didn't use cliches or take the obvious route in developing the story.  Plus, I learned so very much about what life would be like confined to a wheelchair, able only to move your head and one hand.<br /><br />This would make an amazing movie (Bradley Cooper to play Will?)and I'd be first in line to see it.<br /><br />If by any chance the author looks at these reviews, PLEASE write a sequel!!  Louisa Clark is a wonderful character and I'd love to see what happens to her...does she go to university?  Does she go to meet Ritchie?  Does her family come to terms with her decisions?  How does her life turn out?<br /><br />If you want a really great book to start off 2013, this is the one.
0765325950|5.0|The final book in the series is amazing thus far. The characters are at their absolute best, and the writing is top notch. Unlike the self entitled individuals down rating this excellent title, I've actually read its first few hundred pages...<br /><br />I can't fathom the mentality of the individual who petulantly whines about the format of this book...it's a book. A satisfying hard cover. The idea that the author, or a publisher, Owes you information in some format other than that which they choose is absolute nonsense. Buy it, don't buy it. But giving an ultimatum that you'll steal the content out of protest for the lack of an ebook makes you a thief. Hope you are happy with that, one star folks.<br /><br />Hopefully the one-star \\"reviews\\" will be removed, but I think it's a testament to the fairness and impartiality of the \\"evil corporations\\" that they stand. Hopefully other readers will read the one star reviews with disgust and buy this book for its excellent content. And give it the rating it deserves. Protest elsewhere you glorified trolls.
0307361012|5.0|First book in the Harry Hole series and really an great read. I am now going through all the books in the series and each one is excellent. My favorite US author is James Lee Burke and now Jo Nesbo is my favorite international author. Both Burke and Nesbo create plot, characters and locations that bring you right into the middle of the action. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Note: I only listen to books on tape and there Robin Sachs is the best one doing Nesbo books. Work through the other readers until you catch up to Robin Sachs who adds much to the enjoyment.
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved this book, they are troubled and damaged but yet perfect for each other!!<br />Amazing writing and story!! Loved it!
B0072GPQNG|5.0|This is a beautiful story that demonstrates that beauty and emotional connections can coexist with the most horrific of circumstances. The horse isn't a panacea to all problems, but he sure does bring out the best in everyone he touches.  That's inspiring.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was so funny and the artwork amazing.  I would recommend this book to anyone.  The Third Wheel (Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Book 7) is a must-read.

B0041KBWM0|5.0|Great film (if you want to call it that) and the best adaptation I've seen. The score is also beautiful.
B003EV6DBW|5.0|The series gets better and better.<br />Each Doctor brings something new to the story.<br />Great for snowy or rainy week ends.
B0027MJU00|5.0|This book was amazing. It was delicious. I couldn't put it down. I love the twist to the story. You will be pleasantly surprised. It is dark and disturbing. My kind of book. You won't want to put it down. You will never guess how it ends. Gillian Flynn is an amazing author. Read her book &#34;Sharp Objects.&#34; That is a dark and disturbing book with a delicious and fabulous twist.

B000KJT8IG|3.0|I'm only rating the quality of the Blu Ray here (the movie is a true 5-star classic!), as I found the video quality on the Blu Ray to be quite poor.  Very grainy and you can really see a lot of the flaws in the original film recording.  I know the producers can only do so-much to improve upon a movie that was not filmed in Hi-Def, but there are movies from the same era (like Planes, Trains, and Automobiles) that are superior in video and audio quality on Blu Ray.  I think they needed to spend more time remastering the original film for Blu Ray.
B000YEUUCK|5.0|Impressive, is a first-rate artist, highly recommended, a show of such magnitude that one not to be missed. Nothing to waste!

0425263908|5.0|I love to read and enjoy all books!!! Especially fun to read on a cold rainy day. And snuggled  up in a blanket!!!!
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|I loved the game and i couldnt hardly put it down it i had it won.  I loved the extra scenes it gave you in the chest on the main menu too.  One thing is though this is just a free trial - then after you have played it, then it asks if you want to buy it.  So beware if you think this whole game is for free.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|i love love this game. I wish I could get my husband off the friend part so.that I can get my own friends
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Good game I hope you will make more games like this because they aren't coming out with good games and I will make more reviews
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This works very well with cloud documents. It is nice to have access to skydive documents on my kindle. Try to catch it on sale though ;)
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|What can I say that other 5-star reviewers have not already said? So many things make this album great. I will say that I loved Creed back in the day, but I think Alter Bridge has taken the musical element of Creed much closer to its full potential. Here and there you hear snatches of Creed, but that's not a bad thing. Scott Phillips still plays slower-tempo rock better than just about anyone else out there. Mostly, all I hear is original sound combining exhilerating instrumental elements and a singer who is a perfect compliment to the group. \\"Pop\\" is not in Alter Bridge's vocabulary; the signature of the group is the music, which all four band members contribute to. And as a fan of rock MUSIC (as opposed to rock singing with pretty generic musical accompaniment), this album is immensely satisfying.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|nice to be able to hear local radio when i'm not near one. plus can get local police scanner as well!
B007MDB6L0|5.0|My children loved this movie. It is so cute with how everything was made. My husband even sat down and watched it with us the second time!
B00APUYN0I|3.0|Ordered the HD movie, was the exact same as the non HD movie.... Very poor quality... Movie itself was very funny I loved it!!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This show is absolutely one of my most favorite pieces of horror ever created. The acting is amazing and the sets are too.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I bought this for my 11 year old granddaughter and she is very pleased with it. At first she was interested in something bright and colorful but now likes that fact that it protects her Kindle Fire from the damage of every day use. It is simple, but effective and very durable.
B00AH8VU0Y|2.0|I really wanted to love this show, honestly. It had a great plot and interesting development, but the gratuitous gore and forced depression when the characters die is the making of a gore-porn, watched to get those \\"sick\\" feelings in your stomach when watching it and craving for more because it's different. This goal of the writers is to bring people in that way and not so much a straight up good story by itself. So many characters die stupidly when all they literally needed to do was turn their head or pay attention. Re-watch the deaths and see what I mean, almost all are related to unnatural stupidity that normally would not be an issue in the real world, which this is trying to simulate. I guess you can make a case for \\"Darwinism\\", but as soon as enough characters die, more are introduced into the story to \\"fill the gap\\".<br />So much more potential, too bad it got hung up on the shock factor routine.
B0013YPEMG|4.0|Can't download to a Mac either.  Amazon is a good option for things that show up at the door, but they useless for streaming and downloading.  I spend thousands each year with Amazon, but have only had three (all bad) experiences with their digital video product.  I'm going to give them another couple of years before I try again.<br /><br />Still a Kindle fan.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Threat Vector. One of Clancy's best books. Very informative on an extremely contemporary subject<br />confronting this country. Couldn't put the book down.
0765325950|1.0|I've been waiting for this book to come out for ages. It made me wonder why Amazon or B&N didn't have an e-book pre-order. Now I know. I imagined reading this in e-book format in my commute to work, during breaks at work and generally in everyday situations that see me doing a lot of walking. I did not want to carry such a heavy book hence, my desire to buy the e-book.<br /><br />With the e-book unavailable I caved and went to a local book store to buy the hardcover even though I loathed the idea of carrying around a doorstop book.<br /><br />It's not available. I looked for it in another big bookstore and they don't have it either. In fact, it's not available in the entire country...<br /><br />I dreaded this possibility. I've noticed fantasy books seem to have a small market in my country judging by the small selection of the genre bookstores here would carry. This is why I was relying on the e-book being available on Amazon or B&N.<br /><br />It is very frustrating and extremely disappointing to have to wait even another day (much less the four months for the e-book or however long before we get the hardcover in local bookstores) after having waited so long to read the last book in an epic series. Sanderson said that Harriet decided on this in a bid to guarantee that her husband, Robert Jordan's legacy will end on a high note with the last book hitting the top of the best seller's lists. Instead, her decision caused precisely what she wanted to avoid. Ending the series on a down note. Sales-wise, this may not matter ( the book will probably hit the best sellers in both formats) but to the fans and readers denied the opportunity to read the last book on the day of release, her choice to delay certainly left a sour note.<br /><br />Let me repeat that. It is frustrating and disappointing to be unable to read a book that is not yet available in my country when there is a format (e-book) that would have made it available to me if only the publisher (or in this case the editor) had more foresight and trust in new technology.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|What can you say about Downton Abbey that hasn't already been said?!! There's a reason why people LOVE this show. From the first episode you're hooked. I can't speak for others but I think about the characters and their lives throughout my day and in my dreams. They are that captivating. Everything from the writing, to the actors, to the portrayal of tradition and society during the period, to the beautiful location and stunning costumes, this show is hands down the best series to come along in years!
B004SUDQE0|5.0|Great characters with good acting.  A different but fun story line.  Totally enjoyable from start to finish.  Hugh Grant is in his element in this movie.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Good fast read. Perfect for a beach vacation. I found the Vanessa character a little far fetched. She played such a crucial role with little background information on how she got so motivated to take such risks.
B009B0L324|5.0|when you hear of ac dc , is only rock n roll to me, best live album yet, for acdc .................
B001P5HI4A|5.0|So thrilled to actually and finally find this available.  This has been one very difficult DVD to find and it is wonderful to have a copy.  This is one of my all time favourite Barbra Streisand films and it is awesome to have it in my collection!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Simply excellent. Very well done and very believable. This book has make me into a movie written all over it. Read it now and catch th flick in another year...
0446554995|2.0|Okay, I am an addict for the Pendergast series, but this one will break me of that.  What a long winded disappointment.  This book marks the turning point where these two have stopped creating compelling Novels, and started writing novels only to fulfill some publishers contractual requirement.
B0064T6LV8|3.0|The only drawback on these games is the lack of instructions.  That being said,  these games are very true to the original table game, including the fact that you can tilt the machine.  Playing on a tablet, the movement of the tablet is like shaking the machine and you can tilt it pretty easy.  Probably not something that will keep your attention  for very long, but still good to give you that pinball experience.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|In my day job, I'm an editor of science fiction. I have no connection with this book, save that my husband read it and strongly, strongly recommended it to me. My pleasure-reading time is precious to me, and it's so rare for me to find a book that bypasses my editor-brain and lets me ignore a stray typo or two and devour it as a reader. I read WOOL 1 in a single sitting, and then I was hooked. The pacing is perfect, allowing the reader to build suspicions about the way the world works, without making the next twist predictable -- giving enough information for you to figure it out for yourself, but enough ambiguity to make you doubt your conclusions. Beautifully written, tense, and powerful from start to end.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Great solitaire but the ads are awful...truly mystefied why Mobility doesn't let me just pay for this. I would also like to track the games by number...if that is do-able I cannot find it![[ASIN:B0063IH60K Solitaire]]
B004YM6JLO|5.0|Love this season and have all the others seasons, so of course when I saw the price of this one online I got it. Fast shipping and no damage.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I LOVED this story. It's so well written and the characters are very dimensional that you wind up caring about them!!!
