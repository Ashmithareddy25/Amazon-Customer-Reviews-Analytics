So if the director of teen age mutant Ninja turtles is reading this I think u and your bunnys should take a bus!!!! Written by pre-adolescent.

B0074D3CAQ|4.0|I loved the writing - spare, clear, potent.  I loved the evolution of the characters.  Very poignant and thoughtful.  Certainly makes you reflect on your life and relationships.  Would highly recommend this book!

B004XQYBA2|5.0|I love this version! I also like that I am learning other ways to solve the puzzle. Outside the box!
B0071AKB38|5.0|Got the speaker so I could listen to music/news while I was getting ready in the mornings.  It syncs up to my computer/android phone or iPad in seconds and sounds really good for its size.<br />Just a quick tip: The sound quality CHANGES depending on the where you put it.  If I keep it on a laptop case or folded shirt and in a corner I get more bass for music but if I just stick it behind my monitor I get more treble/surround for news.<br />You'll be happy with the sound but the microphone isn't really conference call quality.  You have to be directly infront of the mic so you cant walk around and talk as advertised.
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|Entertaining but did not enjoy Season 3 as much as the first two seasons.  I would recommend Season 3 to anybody who had watched the first two but not necessarily otherwise.  The plotline seems trite at times.
0756407915|5.0|I have read the first and the second days. I can hardly wait for the next one in the series.
0062059963|5.0|Is it next year yet? I need the end!! I love this series so much. It's adorable. Team Maxerica or whatever.

B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Perfect amount of challenges without really having to use the hints, or get frustrated and look for a walkthrough. Good for anyone :)
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|It is one of the best games I have played. I wish there it was where you didn't have to pay for it.
B007R21JJK|5.0|The thing is marked wonderfully, has many ports, and works so well. Obviously, the onboard video card is low end, but still not bad enough to warrant a negative reaction. I would highly recommend.
B00CISC244|5.0|In case you're wondering, the vinyl release *does* contain a download code.<br /><br />Other than that, Boards of Canada. Does what it says on the tin. Does it very well as far as I'm concerned. You're mileage may vary.<br /><br />It is amazing to play Boards of Canada on a turntable.
B003IEJZUG|5.0|#1...book I have ever read.......wow......to really see the TRUE MEANING behind this book......GOD.....1 GOD...... the storm...his faith....religion is a title......I am beyond n love with this book n the TRUE meaning behind it.....get out of the religion box.....bottom line....is1 God threw christ......
B0058Z4NR8|5.0|This book is about why some nations are rich and others are poor.  I don't feel like the authors' theory is perfect, but it really makes sense as far as it goes.  They seem to succeed in avoiding some of the over-generalizations that weaken other theories.  They emphasize the way economic and political institutions develop and maintain themselves.  One way to summarize their position is: sustainable wealth comes from broad inclusiveness of the population in political and economic power.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game for kids and even adults!!!!!! U get to take care of your own hoses and learn to care for them!!!!!!! Minnie games to horse shows, this game is great. You even have the choice to talk to real people!!!!!!! And compete with them!!!!!!
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Very hard not to become fascinated by the portrayal of the characters, good ones and bad. Settings are brilliantly detailed. Not your average pretty Fantasy story.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved this book. It was so so refreshing to read such a unique and interesting point of view. I definitely recommend!
B0039TD826|5.0|It's Exile on Main Street (duh) - who wouldn't love this?  This is a must-have for any classic rock collection.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is addictive, fun ,a time passer, and its great don't think twice about getting this game it is just awesome
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I wasn't sure if it was going to be too hard but it turned out really fun! You have to try but, it's not so hard that you just give up
B003G4W49C|5.0|Some parts were a little dry but most of the book was awsome.  It really makes yiu think about human kind and the things we do.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|This is a good book.  But, keep in mind that it is different than the movie in almost every way except the core concept.  This book, in my mind, is a sequel to the movie.  This is one of those rare instances where I suggest watching the movie and then reading the book.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I originally put off reading this book because I thought it would be too sad. Now I am just sad I did not read it sooner! This is a book that weaves together beautifully all aspects of life; disappointment, beauty, pain, tolerance, grief, love, peace, and appreciation for the present. The characters are intelligent, funny, and real. You will continue to think about them even after you finish the book. Enjoy!
B000SEI230|5.0|What a nice story.  Like the author said at the beginning - it will make you laugh and make you cry. It did!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|One of the best shows on TV.  Can't wait for season 4.  I can't wait to see what happens without Mathew in the cast.
B0047WJ12K|2.0|I'm sure it's loaded with good acting and filming and writing.... but for someone sensitive to life I could not get beyond the blasting of energy on my being.  I would love to see a movie about the concept of this without being energetically attacked.......
0142418471|1.0|This novel is just too much. It's hard to find novels with LGBT themes that are good literature, and although they are out there... this is not one of them. The characters are completely unrealistic. Especially Tiny: the obese, majorly flamboyant, gay jerk that apparently nobody can resist. Trust me, if you read this novel and you have a brain, you will grow to hate this character more and more every page. If half the book weren't written in chat IMs and didn't read so fast, I wouldn't have finished it. I believe the authors tried way to hard to make a book every teen could relate too and it resulted in 336 pages of crap.<br /><br />Save yourself the money and the time.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|I like Bryan Singer and was hoping for a better movie.  I didn't think it was very good and kind of disappointed.
0061474339|5.0|I really enjoyed finishing this book. I thought it was a good end to the trilogy especially because Lirael was totally a lead up into this one.
B0091REZMW|4.0|It's very fun. I like it a lot, but I wish that it wouldn't give you somuch pop-up's with other games.
0425263924|5.0|Well, since I am working on my endless to-read pile of books, I didn't have a hard time waiting for this book to come out.... Although now I can't wait for the next book \\"Captivated by You\\"! I'm in love with Gideon, what can I say? He's melted my heart..<br /><br /> The chemistry he and Eva have with each other is something I think we all either have/wish we had with the loves of our lives.  If not, then that's how it should be.<br /><br />-They're truthful with each other thru out the book, it didn't have a lot of \\"leave you in the dark/ cliffhanger moments\\" and if it did it didn't take long for Ms. Day explain what was going on. Unlike some other books that go on and on with the drama while you pound your fist in the couch cushion waiting for some sort of resolve...<br /><br />- They talk about everything with each other, something every couple needs to survive.<br /><br />- The sex life that they have is O.M.G. . . I'm completely jealous over it. Pretty sure this book alone had double the sex than the previous books had lol!<br /><br />\\"I know it's not fair to ask you to be with me\\" - his head tilted back - \\"when we can't even sleep in the same bed, but I'll love you better than anyone else could. I'll take care of you and make you happy, I know I can.\\" Gideon Cross<br /><br />I melted.<br />______________________________________________<br /><br />There are a lot of certain things that I want to share in this review but I don't want to spoil anything too major for anyone. I do hope that people give it a chance to read and fall in love with it as I have. I know a lot of people are bummed out that this series started out as a trilogy and is now going to be 5 books total.. I swear I could be a part of one of those AA groups for people who fall in love with fictional characters and never want their stories to end. . . .<br /><br />I really like Eva's character as a whole. She's strong, built to succeed in anything she sets her mind to, carefree to a certain degree,and smart. I love her wit that she has about her, I kind of get the feeling that after reading how she handles some heated situations with people she couldn't give a rats ass about, that I could be like that in a similar setting if need be. We've all been in one of those situations where someone will say something to you, it escalates into something nasty for a minute or two, and after it's over you come up with the perfect thing to say right back at them. Yeah well I need to learn how to be more like this chick when that happens again, because she has some spunk.<br /><br />Also a lot of other women who have a rich and powerful man in their lives would love nothing more than to just sit around eating bonbons or chewing gum all day without a care in the world. Not Eva, this girl is like the energizer bunny. Juggling everything in her life, while maintaining a full- time job, her Krav-Maga classes, etc.. Hopefully she'll stay this way in the coming books.<br /><br />I do feel bad for Eva's dad, the man loves an unobtainable woman... The only thing she will ever love will be money followed closely herself. Sad way to live. :( She and Eva have a difficult time with each other in this book. Trust is a H-U-G-E thing with Eva, so glad that she and Gideon didn't that issue. That can get really old with the, \\"What did I do wrong this time, What did I do wrong this time again, etc..\\" LOL!<br /><br />Oh poor poor Cary, still torn between choosing over Tatiana and Trey. I seriously hope that he chooses Trey over that snarky B***, altho the author has made some interesting changes in all of their lives thru the pages of Entwined...<br /><br />I thought it was great that this booked picked up right where \\"Reflected in You\\" left off.  And that it ended without a, \\"Why, What, or Huh?\\" cliffhanger kind of moment, makes it easy to wait on book 4 knowing that it had a happy ending.<br /><br />The plot thickens...<br /><br />Alsooooo, seems we have some mystery with some of the characters. Or maybe it's just me thinking too much into them...? Megumi mysteriously calls in sick for 3 days at the end of the book and she's impossible for Eva to get a hold of so she can see if she's alright. That just seems fishy to me. Also, Will, just seems to sort of show up wanting to go to lunch with Eva a lot. Wonder if he's truly being friendly and just wanting someone to sit thru lunch with him, or if he's working on another agenda?? Do they have something to do with a certain article of jewelry that ended up somewhere it wasn't supposed to be? Or could it be Cross's brother? Maybe even the nosy reporter Deanna?? I could just be watching/reading too many mystery movies/shows/books and they have me thinking too much into it all, LOL!
B004SUWR2C|5.0|Love playing this game.  It is on of my favourite. You never know who is going to win. I know if you like playing the card game you will love it.
0316789720|5.0|My 8 year old loves this book.  It's very easy to follow and has tons and tons of drawing examples.  I think he's getting better at drawing though how much this book has to do with it I don't know for sure.
B009MYAQK4|4.0|I enjoyed The Alchemist and was recommended this book.  Short Chapters on great topics that you should read slowly and think about.  I recommend it.
1439102813|1.0|Sometimes a novel comes along that makes you want to stand up and exclaim, \\"Boy, what a waste of time that was!\\"  Still Alice is one of those novels.<br /><br />It's about a neurobiologist from Harvard who develops Alzheimer's (Oh! The irony of it all!).  But that's not the half of her trouble.  Her biggest problem is that her family (with the exception of one daughter) is a horde of selfish nincompoops. By the way, did I mention she's from Harvard.  Don't worry if you didn't catch that fine point because it's mentioned ad nauseam throughout the book.  Apparently Lisa Genova doesn't have a word count feature on her computer, otherwise she'd have noticed that the word, \\"Harvard\\" appears 8,924 times (I didn't actually check but it sure feels that way).<br /><br />The rest of the book is about as exciting as watching and productive as watching champagne bubbles fizzle out in a flute, because nothing happens. (Things happening are an essential feature to stories, by the way).<br /><br />She gets worse (boy, I didn't see that one coming) but little else happens and by the time she's pretty fully demented readers like me will have lost all interest in her.<br /><br />I suspect that this book received many favorable reviews simply because of its subject matter.  That's fine.  One thing I wish I had checked into before I purchased it was the claim in the author's biography that the book was the 2008 recipient of the Bronte prize.  I tried googling that and all I found was a cruddy Facebook page that states:  \\"The Bronte Prize is an esteemed literary award founded in 2007\\".  (Whatever.)  It had a link to bronteprize.org that seems to no longer exist.<br /><br />If you want to read a far better novel of a doctor fighting to stave off his own dementia, read The Art of Forgetting by Peter Palmieri.  Stuff actually happens in that book.
0786888628|5.0|I am so happy to have found this work and I have to add a rave about it along with the other 200+ reviewers. Now I remember why I majored in History in college. Thanks to David for writing on this era so recently as there has always been too little attention paid to the history here, especially to the mind-sets, as we learned in the similar, repeated mistakes made around the Vietnam struggle, featuring many of the same players. I am so grateful to the author for bringing across as real the soldiers whose courage and determination make this an epic war story. It is the common soldiers who pay the price for a politically split nation with a schizophrenic foreign policy (sound familiar?)! Halberstams' clear, folksy analysis of the common soldiers' ground-up, back and forth experience of the battles as well as describing the all too human foibles of leadership (especially MacArthur) on all sides helped me to understand both the Korea conflict as well as shining a light on today's world situation. My criticism is that there is not enough on the UN part played in the conflict. Also, his approach is a little too focused on the major players like MacArthur and Truman, sometimes very repetitive. I read Kissingers' book on China, I wish Halberstam had done an analysis of Chinese recent history (or maybe even the China lobby - traced to today) to complement his Korea and Vietnam works. Thanks again for a worthwhile read!
B00785P2QC|4.0|I just got this game yesterday and I've been playing ever since! I recommend giving it a go! I know I'm hooked, and you will be too!
B008OOYALE|4.0|I thoroughly enjoy playing, visiting neighbors and seeing what is possible in this game. Lots of fun. Lots of surprises.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|Even though I'm a 40-something viewer, I love this show.  If you don't want to get addicted, don't start watching.  Some of the life issues were a little racy for the age group, but after discussing this with my teenager found that these are actually what is going on in high school. SCARY!  Anyway, loved Season 1...  Even more so, Season 2!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Loved reading this book. Would have given it five stars if ending wasn't so abrupt. Will be following this author from now on.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's a fun game for me and my girls. They fight over who gets to feed her or brush her
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I think Sylvia Day did a great job at getting and keeping the reader's attention. It was definitely a page turner, and you couldn't wait to read what happened next. I wish that the next book in the CrossFire series was already waiting for me to dive into. The way the story ends makes you ready for the next chapter with Eva & Gideon!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|There is no need to review the movies, the movies are great and have always been great.<br /><br />The Blu-ray is done very well, all of the movies are at least very good, the newest two are of course perfect. the first two are very good. Just remember how old the films are. If you bought them all on DVD and now have a 1080p TV, buy these, you will not be sorry.
0425263991|3.0|First off let me say that the price of this book is completely ridiculous. What is up with these authors charging 10-15 bucks for an e-book? But never having paid that much before I bit the bullet and bought it and how I wished I would have waited. This book has no heart. I spend the first 75% of the book disliking Kaleb. That has never happened to me before. I usually find something redeamable about a character. Even for a psy, he was cold, angry, and vendictive. And you're always left with the feeling all the good stuff he does is to suit his purpose. If it didn't help him in some way then he wouldn't care. I felt sorry for Sahara because she had to be around him. I was hoping Kaleb's story would be a bit like Judd's and he would start to feel and be able to manipulate his Silence to keep what he needed. But no, he stays the same cold person all the way through the book. Who wants a man like that? And he was so child-like, and in a bad way. He wanted to kill everyone because they took his girl away, really? So he can act angry, vendictive, and even sorrowful (for what he was made to do to his girl) but the author couldn't thaw him enough to act happy? Even Sahara left me a little cold. She seemed so mousey. Not at all a woman who could live with someone who had such a crushing personality as Kaleb. Ya, the story answered some questions but I didn't really enjoy it. Neither did I enjoy the book before this one. I wish I would have waited until the price went down.
B00AEUPOVQ|5.0|Love all of Jane Austen's classics! Persuasion is a story depicting a woman's struggle in finding her lost love.. Choosing between the ways of society  and her heart.. A common theme as seen in all of Austen's books. If you like period movies, this is one you should see!!
B00CV5ZPA2|1.0|The beats are good and I wish that was all this CD was. Too bad we have to withstand Kanye's nonsense lyrics, delivered in such a way that they are nearly incomprehensible. Note to Kanye: you're not God and nobody cares what you have to say. About anything.
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|This is a great movie no matter how many times you see.  Cant go wrong with DeNiro.  Enjoyed the movie.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love the story of Gideon and Eva.  I was a little disappointed at the abrupt ending of this book, but I have heard that books 4 and 5 will come out later.  While I am impatient to have to wait to continue the story, I am glad it is not over.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Really enjoy using this.  I like to use it when in the kitchen or doing my hobby.  Great for helping you get to sleep.  Very easy to use.  Being able to adjust the volume for each individual sound is a plus.  I paid for this version so that I can listen to it when reading a book or playing a game.  In the free version, you had to stay in the application to listen.  :) :) :)
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Well here is another bomb for kindle fire..  Doesn't load let alone work.  Developers need to really work on their stuff before trying to launch apps on Amazon.  AND Amazon should really test stuff like APPLE does before allowing it on the site
B008N1LL42|3.0|It's a lot like Independence Day actually.  The effects are very good and the movie is exciting.  The beginning is almost campy, kind of strange.  On the other hand, it's ridiculous, again a lot like Independence day.  If you don't expect any sort of reality or consistency and you like special effects, you might like this movie.  Add the usual popular feel good themes and you have a ridiculous movie with great effects.  Kind of a Hollywood standard now.  Three stars for the entertainment of the effects and decent acting.  It's probably really 2.5 stars for the ridiculous part where they use an old battleship.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I of course had to read the book before it came out to the cinama. Glad i did; very good book! MUCH better than the 1st !
B009LRE040|4.0|Great action, awesome story, some nice twists and turns of the plot.  Some great effects, some stupid gun sparking effects that pretty much all Hollywood movies have now.<br /><br />Biggest flaw, Bruce wayne needed a special brace to walk.  His self-rehab in the prison would not have been possible without the brace and how would he have had the brace?<br /><br />2nd biggest flaw, Bruce was broke, how could he have started over in a cave with a huge platform that rose up and implied millions of dollars worth of equipment?<br /><br />Third flaw, the bomb should have killed him, maybe he dropped it in time it didn't look like it, they said it was over the bay not in the bay.  This one could somehow be explained I guess, I can't explain it though.<br /><br />Four stars for action, effects, interesting story, and how Anne Hathaway looks in that cat woman suit.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|Its a nice funny movie that everyone will like! I  think it was also very heartwarming them being in love.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|It just ended so abruptly. But overall great addition to the series. I can't wait to get the next book. I'm hooked.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|It is great to have a charging cord of convenient length.  All others were too short to even check when the item is plugged in.
0439023513|5.0|Came.  Its been a good book to read.  Even I could see the diffidence in this book as the first two book.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|There are so many twists and turns. You will not skim this story. Some of the characters seem detached. Over all I enjoyed the story and the history/culture lessons.
B006TF6WAM|4.0|A vey thought provoking book! A lovely story, I am thinking of similar trip myself butthewife won't let me go!
1594746036|4.0|Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children has experienced a, err... well, peculiar marketing campaign. Look up and down this Amazaon product page and you'll see creepy, moody, atmospheric pictures, a description that reads from something like a horror movie, and a bunch of reviews praising it's quality. When you get the actual book in your hands, the first thing you'll notice are the thick, full color pages. And from there, it only gets more... peculiar.<br /><br />Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, by Ransom Riggs, tells the story of Jacob Portman, a 16 year old American kid who happens to be rather connected with his Grandfather. Over the years, Grandpa Portman has told Jacob countless stories from when he fled his native country of Poland to live in Wales, hiding from the Nazis. In these stories, he told of other strange kids hiding from the \\"monsters\\" and even shows pictures of them. After Grandpa Portman is attacked and killed, however, Jacob goes on a journey to decide whether or not Grandpa's stories were a thinly-veiled metaphor or truthful facts.<br /><br />This book is not a creepy/horror book. It's not even remotely a mystery. Instead, this book is much more similar to [[ASIN:059035342X Harry Potter]] or [[ASIN:0142414166 Groosham Grange]], with a dash of X-Men in it for good measure. That being said, the whole \\"mysterious school for gifted children thing\\" has long been exhausted since those novels debuted in late 1999, and by the time you finally reach Miss Peregrine's home, it won't truly be that much more of a mystery. In addition, there are like, maybe six main, named characters that start from the beginning of this novel that are still mentioned by the ending happens, so there really isn't too much to shock you when it comes to twists about people 's \\"real\\" motives, because they've been hinted at for pages upon pages.<br /><br />The most notable part of this book, however, has to be it's presentation. This is a love-it-or-hate-it type of thing, meaning that each time this particular gimmick is used, you;ll either love it or hate it. As a whole, I find the system working but flawed. Here's how it goes: Jacob rambles on for chapters and chapters about Grandpa Portman or the home, and then suddenly, spliced in the middle fo a chapter, area  bunch of creepy photographs that were written into the narrative. While I found that I liked the photographs and that they were creepy, overall, I found them distracting from the plot, disruptive to flow, and implemented clunk-ily. Jacob would describe four or five pictures for about two pages, and then we'd see what he described, with no added benefit to the reader. They say a picture is worth 1000 words. With this novel, you'll get both.<br /><br />This all begs the question: was this book written for the pictures or vice-versa? There are a few points where it is very clear how a rudimentily a picture was inserted into the plot because Riggs had a nice picture he wanted to use. What starts out as a necessary and intriguing plot device is already tired and over-used by the last page.<br /><br />At the end of the day, I had a lot of problems with this book. It was way too YA-ey for me, and it was too easy to predict. The pictures enhanced the story in only the most basic of ways, and the writing was tight at best. I give this book 3.5 out of 5 stars, because some younger kids will like it, but my advice is to stick to Harry Potter.<br /><br />In other news, apparently a [[ASIN:1594746125 sequel]] is coming out soon, so if you are looking to start a series, this might be it.thing, meaning that each time this particular gimmick is used, you;ll either love it or hate it.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love to hate this game!  It's so difficult to get the hang of, but I love playing this game.  It's hard though!
B00CDT41RY|2.0|Thought I would enjoy it immensely but it turned out to be a bit heavy on the racial side. (yes I know its about the slavery but Samuel Jackson went overboard in the portrayal of his character)The special effects were less than stellar as everyone seem to be shot with the same caliber exploding bullet. People being shot and flying backwards and sideways making it stupid. Like the lady being shot at the end from up stairs yet she fly's off to the left. The angle was completely wrong and you could tell they pulled her mid section with a rope. (DUMB!)
B008XG1X18|5.0|Now I can keep up with my pinteresting on any device.  It's easy to view and repin items.  Grateful for the App.
0345529057|5.0|I saw a few episodes of A Game of Thrones on HBO.  I had missed the first part and bought the books so I could catch up.  I am on book 3 and love it.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love how I can &#34;draw&#34; on any device now!  It's been a great addition to my Kindle!  I can keep up with my games anywhere now!
B005LAIIQC|5.0|I was surprised at how much I enjoyed The Bourne Legacy. Wasn't sure how I'd like a Bourne film without Matt Damon, but the script did a really fine job of continuing the series without him.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Hokey but I read it in three days and cried at the end.  I hate myself for the moments I enjoyed this book because much of the plot was predictable, contrived, and fantastical but the characters were well developed as was the setting.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|A most interesting novel with vivid images that take you across many countries. New characters introduced that have you wondering and wanting to read on. An excellent book by a brilliant author. I can't wait to read yet another book by Mr Hosseini.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  It was a bit different from the book, left a lot out, but still great!
B005OECSNE|5.0|After watched the TV drama, I love this show so much. Every single actor/actress acts so professional and good.<br />I am so glad after reading. More detail are shown in the book. I cannot describe how good it was.....well....I just say &#34;Good TV Drama, Good Book & Good Author!!!&#34;.
B000LXV9ME|4.0|The author/speaker successfully expands the Japanese \\"Kaizen\\" philosophy to a manifesto about achieving big results with small steps that the mind doesn't find intimidating. Great to keep in the car and listen to.
B00969PR18|4.0|Works just fine, even opens the adresses from contacts. Would even pay for it. It exceeds my expectation for a free app. Get it now!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Faithfully read a text every day.  It takes very little time but it is SO rewarding!  I also finish feeling good and in awe of our wonderful God!
1781162646|4.0|I don't understand those that didn't like Michael Kelly's performance.  Having both read the book and listened to the audio version, I thought he was spot on, particularly his Lane Hardy.  Snarky but likable and wasn't that the whole point?  As for the hard copy, this book is fun and reads more like a short story even at 288 pages.  It was interesting learning the carnie lingo and understanding the mechanics of a counter-clockwise Ferris wheel.  The author does a great job of capturing the imagery and feel of a fledgling small-time amusement park in the early 70s and I found myself wanting to go back to Joyland even after finishing the book (without the ghost or killer of course).  I'm personally not a fan of big-time theme parks and can appreciate the guilty pleasure of down-graded amusement parks right down to the low-class staff and heart-choking food.  This is what you visit when you read Joyland and the nostalgia that goes along with it.  Let's be clear, Stephen King is not known for writing hard-boiled crime novels.  He's not Elmore Leonard or Robert B. Parker.  Particular of the latter, I think of \\"Umney's Last Case\\" and, while Stephen King does a great job of taking on the voice of the murder-crime noir, even that story ends in such a surprising way that only he could discover and write.  The point is, if the reader expected hard-boiled crime detective murder-mystery when jumping into Joyland, then the book should be a welcomed change of pace, because it doesn't spoonfeed that type of mood.  Yet, all the traits of a crime novel are there.  Unsolved murders.  Killer on the loose.  The pivotal point where the mystery is solved.  Finally, the face-to-face stand against the killer.  These things are there, but layered within a great story of a young man's discovery of life outside the illusion of first love.<br /><br />There are parts where I had to give in to the \\"machine\\" of the story.  The psychic boy and his crackshot mother both play puzzle pieces that fits too well to round out the ending.  But that's minor to the greater denouement and, after all, I still kept turning the pages all the way to the end of the book.  As for the passage concerning Cheney's heart, well I was still reading from the perspective of the narrator and not the author.  It's fiction and if a little of the author's political ilk trickles in, it's still fiction. Why downplay the enjoyment from the journey of a good novel because of some slight against your personal belief system?  I do not personally share the author's political stance, but is it really that big of a deal as far as the story is concerned?  If a reader happens to be athiest, should that reader shun a great novel like \\"The Road\\" because there is a passage concerning the father's adoration for his son stating: \\"If he is not the word of God, God never spoke?\\"  I say focus on the story for its enjoyment and if there's a portion of that story that feels like an attack upon my personal morals and beliefs, it's that author's freedom to write whatever he wants and I remind myself my name isn't anywhere in the contents of that story.too well to round out the ending.

B006YW52Y2|5.0|Really moving film. Loved the rapport between Eastwood and the young man he befriended. Very much the kind of film you want to spend some quiet time with. It also made me question how i interact with my own father. That's a good thing. I can't say i've enjoyed many of Eastwood's films in recent years, but this was truly a wonderful movie.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|A must see! Great performance by Ben! Highly recommend it. Whether it is for date night or a movie with your friends.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Really loved this movie!  Riveting and exciting!  Just had to turn up the volume to strain to hear the normal voices, but other than that, it was wonderful!
B00AIBZLVY|5.0|This production pleasantly surprised me!....There is some old saying about Simplicity is Elegance...well, the special effects in this are not over-done with over-the-top complexities, which is a huge plus for the feel and effectiveness of this story.  While it does have the special effects it needs to draw you to the supernatural conclusion,  it affects the heart and leaves a lasting impression, rather than bombarding the visual senses with shocking blasts, making it more believable.  And, thankfully, it was appropriate for any age level--although there is a bit of profanity in a couple of scenes, and some sexual intimacy, it was not riddled with either throughout, nor was there obvious violence or bloody scenes.  I will not spoil your experience by giving you more details, but I really, REALLY appreciated the classiness of this production.  Very well done!
B005FDXT32|5.0|Movie was sipped fast, and new as promised. The quality of the Blu-ray experience was stellar. Thanks for the disc, definitely made for a great movie night at home!
B009GEEMLY|4.0|Very enjoyable movie, was looking for a Friday night movie to watch came across this and enjoyed it very much. Helps I'd you've seen other superhero movies first though.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  Telling the story of WWI, though each family, each bringing a very different prospective to the book.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I have read all 3 books in this series and I do love them but was frustrated to find out after I waited so long for the 3rd book to come out that now there's a 4th book we have to wait on!!!! I feel like the writer didn't consider her readers when writing the 3rd book the way she has, ending it the way she did is so unfair! ofcourse I will still buy the next one as I want to know how it ends with Gideon and Eva....but geez how long to we have to wait????
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Lots of entertainment ... tough to put down... always trying to beat my last score... give it a try, works well on a tablet
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|This book was a complete waste of time. It is leading up to a fourth book. Nothing happens skip it.
B00821OX98|4.0|Falling Skies sets forth an engaging story line that combines plenty of action with solid and likeable characters.  It does so without succumbing to the simplistic plots of  built-in up alien flicks. Both seasons I've viewed so far have been fully enjoyable.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun to play. Needs to save progress during any given level so that in case the game it would pick up where you left off.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|A great follow up to The Kite Runner, A Thousand Splendid Suns was both beautiful and tragic. Once I started, I couldn't put the book down until I'd read the whir thing.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really enjoyed this game and I think this is a wonderful game for people who love animals. Thank you.
1401225756|5.0|This is a unique and beautifully drawn graphic novel. It does, however, have adult content and themes. It is just the first volume of many, but I am glad I finally started it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I believe this is a very fun game. I always wanted a horse and now I can have one for free!!!! Everyone should get this game.
B009FZHYKU|1.0|Excited to watch season 3. Finally decided to purchase it, just to find that it doesn't play on any of my devices. Cannot return it.  No customer support in this department. Really?!? I can't believe that Amazon does not work with Android.
B009LE7AU4|4.0|Good book. John has a very friendly way of telling a story-you feel at times like you are listening to an okd friend tell a story. He doesn't try to paint himself a perfect person though, he's very real with his stories and descriptions of past events in his life and in the band.  He's also very careful in telling what he see's as the truth without dragging anyone else down or throwing anyone under the bus. He hints at the problems and struggles in tge band but I think in his desire not to point fingers he leaves out some details and it almost feels like theres something missing.  But is still a very interesting story and it's so nice to read about how he didn't give up in his career or on his self.
B00BV2M9LO|3.0|Wasn't as good as Jurassic park. I got hooked in the beginning bc of all the science stuff, and enjoyed all the other scientific facts that was throughout the book, but the plot didn't get me addictive to the book.
B009MF5BXK|4.0|I thought this movie would be like the 1st one and it was to a point but with all the stars in it, it became funny. I still like it and recommend it to others.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Suffers is a really cool game. You have to like survive to get los OF kind to get some awesome characters!!!!
B009MF5BXK|4.0|I thought this movie would be like the 1st one and it was to a point but with all the stars in it, it became funny. I still like it and recommend it to others.
B00555X8OA|5.0|Wow, this book blew my mind.  I need to read it slow to absorb and apply each chapter.  This book will really change the way you view the world.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|This was a nice addition to my collection and Igot to get the 1st one to go with it. Amazon is great and the movie got here when they said it would and I will continue to use this site.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I like Daniel Craig. He does a good Bond character. &#34;some people are coming here to kill us, but we're going to kill them first.&#34; The movie started off with hard action. Love it!!!
B00AF6B22E|5.0|I was slow to watch this movie but quick to buy it because I heard it was a good movie. The price was good and so was the movie. I even bought a 2nd one to give as a gift. I received it in a timely manner and will continue to use Amazon.
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|I thought it was a very unique way of showing a type of re-incarnation of the human soul. I really enjoyed the way the actors were used for multiple characters in different times. It was an interesting pattern showing how people can be inter linked through time showing that some hidden memories exist after death.<br />I also very much enjoy Tom Hanks and Hallie Berrie as actors. I can't say that I enjoy all their movies but I have seen quite and I do like most of them. They made a good pairing playing both opposite and in tangent with each other.<br />There were moments of confusion when the movie flipped from one time to another but in the end I liked the way it all came together.<br />I would and have recommended this movie to several people.
B004I9G486|3.0|Just received and installed in 2010 VW Golf.  Definitely not OEM.  Had to cut away on my iphone 4S protective case to fit; also was a little tight getting attached to car outlet.  But it charges my phone and played music over car speakers.
B000MD9UJC|5.0|I love the bright light it give.  I  should odered before I  did.  I  well  oder  more of these in the futtuer
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I loved it. Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman a d the others were great!  I can't wait for part two to vome out.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game was probably the the best game I ever played in my whole life I totally loved it.Creatives good but it doesn't have all the blocks I expected.Survival is awesome I just love it!!!
B00COHAUD4|2.0|What a waste.  The two child actors in this movie do a spectacular job and could really have made a great movie.  The screenplay, however, is terrible.  What \\"mama\\" is, is poorly designed and not explained very well.  Her motivations are....stupid.  This could have been a really great vehicle for a story about a supernatural entity that adopts two little girls and then comes into conflict when they are \\"saved\\".  Could have.  Unfortunately, \\"mama\\" is barely a one dimensional character who doesn't so much as utter anything intelligible let alone show any motivation that makes any sense.  The adult actors aren't much better.  The main protagonist ends up in a coma for no particular reason for much of the movie.  His girlfriend is borderline despicable but the writers seem not to understand this.  The doctor shows some real promise of an actual plot development, with the revelation that his interest in the case of the two girls involves some research into the supernatural he seems to be doing.  And then he dies senselessly, cutting off that plot development instead of actually going anywhere with it.  Even the special effects were crappy.  The parts where you don't see Mama are far better (due to the acting of the two child actresses) than when you actually do.  By this I mean, there are scenes where you can't see mama but the girls are interacting with her in some way.  Her presence is implied rather than seen.<br /><br />All, in all....a waste of time and a waste of talent.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Love this pack so glad to get all the movies in one pack  on Blu ray...VHS was getting so worn out
0307917509|5.0|This is the novel that hooked my wife and I on the Harry Hole series. We've now read 5 of his books. I believe this has been the best of the 5 we have read.<br />We have read The Snowman, Phantom, The Leopard, The Devil's Star, and The Red Breast.
B0052GACNM|5.0|The first track with Lady Gaga really shows the clarity of her voice and her clever mind.  My favorite cut.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Quite simply I'm addicted.  Period.  I need help.  Walking dead is some messed up stuff but if you are into post-apocolyptic<br />genre there can't possibly be any better.  And man, oh, man, do I want to whack some biters.  My suggestion to anyone thinking<br />about jumping in is do so head first and be ready to squirm a little because it's pretty graphic but extremely well written, well acted and WELL DONE!  Annoys the heck out of me that I had to pay for season 3 because it was free on AMC, but I' guarantee I'll be<br />in front of the tube when season 4 starts.
B006ZXZWP4|5.0|This book is laugh out loud funny. I love Tina Fey's humor. I would definitely reccommend reading this book soon.
B00B7HQ1DA|5.0|You could easily see Al Green singing many of these songs. To me, that is a compliment about the material that Boz chose and his performances.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Every Ken Follett book that I have ever read has been an epic! They capture your attention...it's hard to put the book down...so interesting with lots of historical facts included! Love this book and look forward to the sequel!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|this game is awesome.yes it takes a long time to hatch a dinosaur or remove something but its a really fun game.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|The game is great and interesting. You get to build your own village.<br />I double dog dare you to download this awesome game.
0307276902|4.0|This book is one in a million. It is very unique, but also very dark, deep, complex, and very different. A lot of people bash on the writing style, saying the structure of the book is due to little knowledge on how to write and how to write a story well. In my opinion that is just ignorant, I mean, he is the one with a published book, right? The way the book is written is on purpose, and adds to the experience of the book. The majority of the book is written in choppy, repetitive sentences, but is done so in a way that it adds to the story. James is a drug addict, an alcoholic, and a criminal. The book is written the way it is to make a point, to show his inner-self and to show his personal side when it comes to the situations that arise in the book. I really don't think it would be the same read if it was written any other way. I liked this book but do agree it could have been better. Either way, I was glad I read it and finished it.
B005ETA5K2|1.0|I just sent the device back with an RMA.  I make my living repairing, configuring and supporting all manner of network gear. Especially wireless networks.<br />This device was configured every way to Sunday and it could see but not associate to the Access Point. Even with encryption turned off it would try but fail to maintain a link. After considerable research I was able to find the latest Realtek device driver and still no luck. It was time to contact tech support to get another look at what the problem might be.  I wrote three emails to tech support, got answers to 2 of them stating that I needed to contact them again. I did and still no follow up on their side so I decided that's enough time wasted and returned it. Was it hardware or software or my interpretation of their installation procedure? I'll never know but I won't go back to find out. Hope this helps someone. The rave reviews I researched were for the pea-green colored adapter. This one was silver (important I guess because TS asked what color the device was.)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is fun. Would recommend it to friends. One of the best games I have played so far. Thank you
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|its a awesome game for good recorces of game playing. It is a awesome fun game to be playing yeah.
B0061S0A64|5.0|This is an awesome app! More fun than most game. It allows you to be creative and is beautiful to watch.
B000JVT09C|4.0|Yes, this was a tribute to the Superman presented to us by Christopher Reeves and Richard Donner, but it worked.  Kate Bosworth was well cast as Lois and, Brandon Routh was a superb pick for the role of Superman.  Kevin Spacey's Lex Luthor was ok but I just didn't like the character...I didn't like Gene Hackman as Lex either.  I very muched liked the twists and turns. In fact, I went back through the DVD version last Saturday with my son...I skipped about 50% of the Lex Luthor scenes (kept what I thought were the value-added ones)and I really enjoyed it!  The CGI Superman shots were weak, and I found them to be a distraction, otherwise, the action sequences, the plot, the pace, the cast, and the script all worked for me. I have the movie poster of Superman and Lois Lane,framed and on the wall - the movie is that good.
B00003CXA6|4.0|enjoy it, but after playing the CD 3 times the last portion of the movie could not be seen. Not sure why
B005544V6A|5.0|It is a new show to me, recently have had time to watch TV. Funny, sharp, witty and holds my attention which is not easy. 5 stars.
B007SGM084|5.0|I am sure it is not for everybody but I will read it again.. The movie will have to be x rated
0345536886|5.0|Although I had seen \\"The Rainmaker\\" and \\"The Runaway Jury\\"  before,  this is the first John Grisham book I have ever read.  In general,  I am not crazy about reading fiction because I find most of them having predictable, similar, and  boring story lines with characters or events you can't relate to.<br /><br />On the other hand, reading this book was so pleasurable not different than eating candy or chewing bubble gum. The story line was so original,  unpredictable and  full of surprises with each twist and turn, I couldn't wait to turn each page to find out what happened next. The main characters,just like the rest of us, were less than perfect with issues of their own. Not only I could relate to these people, I wondered and cared about what was going to happen to them next.<br /><br />The author  obviously is very observant and has an amazing insight and understanding of human nature/ condition.  Personality traits of each person, their actions and events were analyzed and described in a consistent way.<br /><br />The best part of the book was the light-hearted  and gently writing style. Not only I was absorbed in the story line while reading but I had a great time since I  couldn't stop laughing especially reading the last two hundred pages or so...
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I loved this book. It was fast paced and was different from other books I have read.The plot was definitely original in my opinion. I loved the characters and was completely hooked until the very end. I can't wait to read the rest of the series!!
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|Even though I got this app as the free app of the day, I would absolutely pay the $1.99 that is being charged for this beautiful app..You can change the settings easily anyway you like. Then, you can create swirling images like smoke whirling off a brightly colored inferno, or a  uncoiled viper ready to bite. The result is so majestic and pretty that all I really want to say is I love it!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game keeps me entertained for long periods of time, however I get quite frustrated with it when I can't figure it out. Great game for those who like to solve puzzles!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I think this series was better than 50 shades. I like both books but this series was a little more realistic.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|I would recommend this product and the service.  The price was great and the item was exactly as described great
B00CDT41RY|1.0|Someone is boosting Quentin Tarantino's ego so high to where he feels he doesn't have to put out quality, the only movies I really feel he put his magic touch on were the 'Kill Bill' films, 'Django Unchained' was a long drawn out affair which should've had 30-45 min cut and was pretty boring when there was no action, then when there was action it was this over-the-top blood splatter fest which was laughable, this was not a western, I don't know what is was but Tarantino missed the mark on this highly overrated movie which was western done wrong. I recently purchased it and gave it away immediately, Tarantino needs to come back down to earth and make films worth watching, a star goes to Jamie Foxx, Chris Waltz, and Leo Dicaprio's acting which was ok but everything else was a waste, 165 min of my life gone down the drain.
B00C81LYH2|5.0|I have been a collector of dolls off and on for about 40 years, but never got around to adding a Barbie to my collection. This is a lovely doll that is just as pictured in the photograph on the product page. Because it does come in the toy category, I did complete the star rating, but for an adult collector it is probably meaningless. I intend to keep the Holiday girl in her collector's box at least until December, but I did take a good look at her outside the box. The dress is lovely and appropriately festive. Barbie's hair is long and blond with a great curl that I can only dream of! She has the typical Barbie regular features and makeup -- although I do think her neck is too long, we can't go by the human body to judge Barbie. The box says the age range is 6 and up, but I don't think that this is a doll to be played with, but rather one that should be displayed, even if it is given to a child. Keeping that in mind, the giver needs to know his or recipient pretty well. If this is for a child that likes to make Barbie into an action figure, I think there are less expensive alternatives, as the doll retails for about $50.00. Good edition to an existing collection or to start one from scratch.
B00152VWJA|3.0|Greatest Hits Compilations do not work very well for some Artist's. At Least they don't until all the pieces of The Puzzle are found and put in place which usually comes at a later date....if ever! This \\"ALL THE WAY...A Decade Of Song\\" Greatest Hits compilation gives us a portion of the cream of the crop from Celine Dion in The 90's but this gal had so many great songs then: it's hard not to purchase: at least: 1 or 2 of her Studio CD's from that Decade to go with this CD.<br /><br />Of the 16 Songs here: only 1 of her Hits from \\"The Colour Of My Love\\" CD is to be found and that Song is \\"The Power Of Love\\". Where is The #23 US Hit \\"Misled\\", The #93 (and Very Underrated) Semi-Hit \\"Only One Road\\" &  The Sleepless In Seattle Duet \\"When I Fall In Love\\" (performed by Celine and Clive Griffin)? All 3 of these are on that Studio CD. Also.....how can they forget to put The #4 US Hit \\"Where Does My Heart Beat Now\\" on this CD? That's also a Great Song from Celine's even earlier (and 1st English) Studio CD called \\"Unison\\". There is more but I believe you get the message! I am Not Condemning this CD. As a matter of fact: I own it and will probably keep it but I also own Studio CD's by Celine Dion to help fill in the Void. This Disc misses several of her Well-Known Songs from The 90's and The 90's is what this \\"A Decade Of Song\\" Compilation was suppose to cover in the first place & the same problem still exists because roughly 14 years later we can Fast-Forward to today and there are other more-up-to-date \\"Greatest Hits\\" & \\"Best Of\\" CD's of Celine's on The Market but everyone of them I looked at also had at least one of her High Charting Songs missing. In 2001: Sony Music Entertainment/Columbia Records put out a 2-CD Mariah Carey Greatest Hits Package and for many Mariah Carey Fan's:<br />it's perfect! It's focus is mainly on Mariah's 90's Material and it's Great! I think one Song is from The Year 2000. I wish they would do the same for Celine.<br /><br /> Speaking of Mariah: during The 90's I sometimes would compare Celine Dion and Mariah Carey. Not because I thought they remind me of each other (and they don't) but because they both had Great Voices and they both had their 1st Big US Hit's in 1990. Mariah's 1st Big US Hit was \\"Vision Of Love\\" and in June 1990 it Topped The US Charts at #1. Celine's 1st Big US Hit was \\"Where Does My Heart Beat Now\\" and in December 1990 it Peaked at #4 on The US Charts. Both ladies are Highly Talented and The 90's Music Scene wouldn't have been the same without them!.....When The 80's & 90's Both are concerned: Mariah Carey, Whitney Houston And Celine Dion all three were Stunning. Just listen to Mariah's \\"Anytime You Need A Friend\\", Whitney's \\"Where Do Broken Hearts Go\\" and Celine's \\"Where Does My Heart Beat Now\\" and you can hear & feel the Power & Resemblance in their voices!<br /><br />My Package is the completely eco-friendly Package. 1999 Sony BMG Music (Canada) Inc. and it's Manufactered and Distributed by Columbia Records. There are no Liner Notes at all.<br /><br />My Final Thoughts: My daughter worked for Blockbuster in 1997 when The Motion Picture \\"Titanic\\" hit The Theaters and she was also working there when The Movie came out on Video in September 1998 and I gotta say: That was a Very Special Time not only for us but also for The Entire General Public! The Stat's speak for themselves! As most of you already know: Celine's \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" was the Love Theme for that Movie and they Both were \\"Huge\\" to say the least and That Ballad IS on This CD...Along with \\"The Power Of Love\\", Beauty & The Beast\\", \\"Because You Loved Me\\", \\"Love Can Move Mountains\\" plus a few other Mega-Hits! \\"Because You Loved Me\\" was Another Beautiful Theme Song to Another Great Movie being The Pfeiffer/Redford Classic \\"Up Close And Personal\\"! So was \\"Beauty & The Beast\\". It was The Theme Song to The Movie of the same name. As I said above: Celine Dion helped Define A Decade and whoever put this Compilation together did a decent job but they could have went \\"ALL THE WAY\\" and made this a Classic \\"Decade Of Song\\" Package.....For Real!
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|Having been a huge fan of the 'Ryche since I saw them open for Ozzy on the Rage for Order tour, I had all but lost any hope of enjoying any new music from the actual band because outsiders were writing most of the songs and they sucked to be honest.  Fast forward to the firing of Tate and all of a sudden the band is just that, a band again, and it shows on this album. It is easily the best I have heard from them since Promised Land. LaTorre (the new singer)is not a Tate clone, and while he does hit some 1985-ish Tate notes, his voice has a rougher edge to it that fits perfectly with the sound of 2013 Queensryche. Sometimes there is addition by subtraction and that is exactly what has happened with Queensryche.  Welcome back guys!
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Beethoven meets Skrillex....soothing, yet I wanna jump on the treadmill at the same time. heck even my son likes it!
B0015XAT3Y|4.0|CD arrived quickly and there were no defects.  sound quality was fine.  brought back memories of the first time I saw them tour.
B00124PXW8|4.0|When I first saw this movie I was scared to death with the horror. It was great then and although I didn't get quite as scared this time it was still a good movie and I'm glad I watched it.<br />This is certainly a good movie to watch during the SD thunderstorms snuggled up with your honey.
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|I enjoyed the movie. My brother thought it was kindof cheesy, but i enjoyed it. The Quality was good too.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|Harold's pilgrimage made me sad, made me laugh and made me look deep inside myself.  We tend to be so into ourselves that we forget those nearest and dearest to us.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|I love this whole book. The beginning middle and end all have action and a great plot that develops into a deeper message. I would give this book a million stars if I could.
B006LSZECO|3.0|At first I thought this book seemed to be ripped from the headlines, but then the twist came which I loved!  I really thought it deserved a more thrilling ending, though.
1781162646|5.0|This is another solid and entertaining story from Mr King, it's also fairly short which makes for a quick read. It's not the Stephen King who wrote It and Cujo but the one who wrote 11/22/63, the story is more real and less super natural but does contain elements of the super natural. The characters are interesting and the story flows nicely along and for me at least never got boring. If you're looking for a quick entertaining read I think this one fits the bill. Enjoy.
B0089LOG02|5.0|What a heartbreaking and uplifting story at the same time.  So inspiring.  I was a foster parent and this hits a cord with me.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I'm not a person who normally cracks a book open on a regular basis. I really got into this book for the first time in awhile. It was interesting to see what turn it would take next. I would recommend to friends.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Very good read. Hopefully when the movie is made they will stick closely to the book. Otherwise, it'll be boring.
B00D2ZF3GQ|1.0|I am not reviewing the DVD at all, I just wasted $10.50 watching this mess. Not the directors fault, the acting is SHAMEFUL. I guess if you have a rich father this is a vanity project :(
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like how you guys put that you can switch cloths for certain players and that you guys give out new players that you have to buy but they are awesome
B00A44HRG2|2.0|Not only poor coverage but no way to find specific areas.  I didn't like it.  The subjects they covered were of NO interest to me, and I can only imagine others viewpoint.  Don't waste your time.
B00CO52NLI|5.0|My daughter love this game it a fun game I told her I'd she can take care of the animals on this game she can get a pet she did I got her q bunny dog cat snake
B000TXNDUW|2.0|Most of the reviews for this film stated that it was excellent.  I can't recommend it.  It seemed to drag on forever.  The long conversations - for the sake of only conversation - made the movie seem really long.
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|this is an awesome app! It's so fun to play when you are bored and have nothing else to do
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Painful, beautiful, complicated, poignant, sexy . . . This one has it all.  A difficult subject tackled with grace and realism.  Great book.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game is one of the best games I have on my kindle Fire HD. Right now I am ranking up on multiplayer. There are different classes and specializations try out making it easy to become the best player ever
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Very good and good story line. They were not trying to keep the story going but it was just natural flowing.
B0029LCJJS|1.0|Very bad writing, mostly bad acting, weak direction. Music and visuals ok, though. Can't imagine why anyone would watch it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Amazing! Totally absorbed in this book. Very well written. Moving on to 50 shades darker...I can't wait to see what happens.
B0011NVCSO|4.0|I've got a horrible pressing of \\"For Emma...\\" wobbly and noisy. Totally unplayable but Amazon is willing to replace it quickly and I don't even have to send the bad copy back! Their customer service is top notch. Too bad about the vinyl version of For Emma... I heard it's just a bad pressing overall. I hope my next copy is playable at least.
B004LPLU4K|2.0|We got about about 45 minutes into it before my daughter was hi-ding her face and crying hysterically for me to turn it off. Not for sensitive children.
0385349947|5.0|THIS WAS AN A VERY INSPIRING BOOK FOR BOTH HUSBANDS AND WIVES, EVERY YOUNG PERSON STARTING OUR SHOULD HAVE  A COPY.
1118026470|5.0|Excellent purchase..... I liked and I buying other in the future.... Excellent....!<br />Me gusta muchas veces, muchas veces, muchas veces.......
B008AWBQGW|3.0|Here you have a Skynyrd album, and it sounds like all the other Skynyrd albums since 1997. It is perfectly listenable, but if we've learned anything since 1977 is that no one can write songs like Ronnie did. The songs are good but nothing is particularly memorable.
B004EPZ070|5.0|Excellent purchase..... I liked and I buying other in the future.... Excellent....!<br />Me gusta muchas veces, muchas veces, muchas veces.......
B008G59IKO|5.0|Put it in your CD player and it won't come out for two weeks. In an era of filler, this album is solid from start to finish.
0553805371|5.0|Not the easiest reading I'v done but extremely interesting.  It has me really thinking in terms of bigger and bigger ideas.
B008C1O8CA|5.0|Put it in your CD player and it won't come out for two weeks. In an era of filler, this album is solid from start to finish.
080701429X|5.0|Order it now, read it immediately when you get it :) Great book that I will be reading over and over again..
B008G59IBI|5.0|Put it in your CD player and it won't come out for two weeks. In an era of filler, this album is solid from start to finish.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is one of the most addicting games I've played. My whole family enjoys playing against each other. It's fun for all ages
B008PE9GSA|3.0|The album is ok, I've only listened a few times because they seem bored and it is a boring album. I have almost their entire catalog and this is not their best by far.
0070511136|3.0|I'm just glad it was not too expensive. I just needed this for a class. It had some great strategy for selling but if it was not for the class I wouldn't have bought it.
B000002KDS|5.0|This is one of my favorite Alice albums and one that really started his career. I would highly recommend and you won't be disappointed.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Word and phrase lookup as well as chapter and verse. Great for those who have memorised a lot of scripture, but don't remember the exact addresses (so to speak).
B008KZVNFS|5.0|I loved this series - and it gets even better with repeat viewings.  If anyone were to delete this from my DVR between now and the time the Region 1 Discs ship I WOULD kill them.<br /><br />Rebecca Hall is a force, and the rest of the cast is fantastic.  Yes it's a bit uneven at times but just go with it - it's worth the ride.  This is not a comfy \\"sit back and be spoon fed\\" piece by any means.  The characters are so layered and complex that you really feel you know them.<br /><br />After watching Parade's End I saw Benedict in Star Trek - and he was no where NEAR as impressive/appealing without Ford/Stoppards beautiful words and clear motivations. True - he's an actor who can make just about anything he says sound good - but why should he have to?  Parade's End is in a word - DELICIOUS!!<br /><br />The physical changes in Cumberbatch's character over the 10 years of this are at times a bit jarring, but it is 10 years, and he is playing a fat, clumsy, ugly, blond Yorkshireman - if you can imagine.  (He does get \\"prettier\\" as it goes on - if that's important to you).<br /><br />After I watched this - I picked up the audio of all 4 of Ford's books (42 hours).  The detail, stream of consciousness content, backstory, and follow up are whip cream with a cherry. I highly recommend it!  Tom Stoppard did a masterful job of capturing the books in his script - as I could NEVER have figured out what was going on in the books had I not seen this first. Talk about jumping around...<br /><br />Personally, Parade's End is my clear #2 (for Cumberbatch) - right behind 2004 BBC's Hawking - with the dazzling Sherlock at #3.  It really is that good.<br /><br />Also note - that the 6 negative reviews right now are all technical/operator problems that have nothing to do with the content.  This should have more stars.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have never read a whole book before this and it was pretty good. I would recommend it to anyone.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|Originally got this app for my kids to use, but I must admit I am a little partial to this one as well. Good for some mindless fun.
B004A8ZWVK|2.0|not only was I bummed that it was a used item when I thought it was new and then it does not work in my dvd player&#62;<br />good thing I did not pay a lot for it,
B0058VW36U|4.0|Originally purchased this one for the kids and they really enjoy it, but I admit it I have played on occasion a few times.
0060516070|5.0|I would highly recommend this as a foundational component in the education of any manager or executive, and the first book to read of Drucker's body of work.  The material in this book is easily applicable at any level of management and poses questions that ask the reader to think critically about what they do and how they do it.  I found Drucker's exposure of common fallacies particularly enlightening, especially since he provides sound logic and rhetoric to substantiate his position on topics.<br /><br />A perfect gift for the newly promoted manager or graduate business student.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|We rented this one and had a family movie night, we all really enjoyed it. It also played well on our Roku box nice and smooth without any problems.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is an addicting ocean of munching and crunching that I love to play with my brothers. I can't wait to upgrade to the next shark
B0087EACJK|4.0|I like the challenges of this game. I haven't played enough to master this one, but my 6 year old really enjoys the challenges.
0385349947|5.0|I really love this book. It is a fast read and very insightful, and the book itself is good quality.
B0059WTMLW|5.0|I am new to Sudoku but have been interested in learning to play for a while now. Got this app and have really enjoyed using it. It has been easier to learn on verses using paper.  As I am new I am using the very easy skill option but there appears to be levels for every skill type.
1423140605|5.0|Very good. Loved this follow-up to &#34;The Son of Neptune&#34;. It wrapped up all the loose ends from previous 2 books and started us off in new directions. Riordan keeps the pace moving and gives us more to look forward to in future books.
B00CGPPMKU|4.0|I like this app for adding a new element to my drawing ability. Although I am not a professional artist, I do like drawing and find it relaxing and fun.<br /><br />I would love to see either the addition of, or a new version that can take advantage of the Samsung Note line of products with the S-pen (active matrix fine tip stylus). While it does allow you to use a stylus, the result is the same as using a finger and it would be nice to get the additional fine tip ability for even better usability. However, I think this would increase the cost for everyone, but I know Note lovers like me would enjoy it!<br /><br />It would also be nice to see different \\"tips\\" such as smoke, liquid, etc.<br /><br />Otherwise, for the price, it is a pretty cool app!<br /><br />Oh, and my toddler loves it too. Saves me a lot of money from having to buy paper and finger paints! :-)
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I could not put this book down.........I felt like I knew Katie and Alex. I loved the ending too! Great Book!!!!
B009PNQUXO|5.0|I love your tube the app it is cool......:) this app is like a little bit better than the real youtube.......
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Neat clues and interesting ways to find them. Can't wait for next levels. These free ones were pretty easy so hope future levels put more brain power to use.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|The one bright spot was Sally Fields great performance as Molly Lincoln. I'm sorry, I found this movie a bit boring.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Every part of this book had me wanting more the story was every well told couldn't believe how the book turn out
074322454X|5.0|Band of Brothers is a fantastic telling of the history of Easy Company from its training stateside and its heroic exploits fighting the Germans.  The author expertly lays out not only the history but also the men behind the history.  Much of the story revolves around the leadership of Major Dick Winters and the non-commissioned officers of Easy Company whose efforts led to success in battle after battle.  A tremendous read and important book to memorialize the actions of all those who fought in WWII.
B000P0J0EW|5.0|morgan freeman and tim robbins were great and the co-actors helped make the movie alot more interesting and worth the time to watch and buy the movie
B005LAIIJY|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  It's nice to see a movie where the Black man is the hero AND gets the girl in the end!  I hope Quentin Tarantino does &#34;Django - Part 2!
B00004WG2F|5.0|loved the country side-actors-story and all around a great movie and i know you'll like it to,  buy the movie, it is worth the money
B00499NHLC|5.0|The show is very entertaining but doesn't take itself too seriously. Story seems to flow well and doesn't leave you wondering when it will finish.
034580404X|5.0|it was an amazing trilogy and miss reading it now i have read it all!!! hope she will write more of these!!!
B006AZZPCM|2.0|Requires a shutdown of kindle fire on a frequent basis as the app freezes but audio continues to play. I would delete this app, but it is better than others available. It is hard to believe amazon does not offer a suitable non-crashing app for YouTube considering its popularity.
B00AF6MF9I|2.0|Graphics are good. I play using my kindle and my droid and it appears that mobile phone users can only war with other mobile phone users. And kindle users can only war with kindle users.<br /><br /> I have also discovered that patches and updates are first issued to mobile phone users and then kindle users a few weeks later. I think these two things are lame. Aside from that it is a good game to play.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I was a little unsure of how this story would pan out as it is a little fantastical, but it's told in such a refreshingly quirky manner that it only takes a few pages into it before you're hooked.  The use of such creepy photographs serves to add a level of mystery that become a foundation for some excellent storytelling!
B0029ATTAQ|1.0|If you are familiar with this particular movie, and you are one of those people who are sensitive to speed and pitch, then you should definitely not buy this Korean edition. I have watched this movie dozens of times before, and I also have the original Dominic Muldowney soundtrack on CD. I noticed immediately that something was wrong. The movie runs slightly faster than it is supposed to run. It is especially noticeable when the Muldowney parts of the soundtrack music are playing, and it is even noticeable during the dialogue. Everything is too fast, and therefore at a higher pitch than it should be. I know a lot of people could get past this, and some people may not even notice it, but it is so distracting to me that I want to return it. However, Amazon's return policy states that they will only refund 50% of a DVD purchase if it has been opened. I guess asking how you are supposed to know whether or not there is something wrong with a DVD without opening the box is a stupid question. As I said before, I'm sure some people will not even notice the speed error, but others will, so I think it's best to avoid buying this Korean version. In this high-tech world of digital precision, it is difficult to understand why this transfer could not be done at the exact speed as the original release. The runtime for 1984 is listed as being 1 hour and 53 minutes on IMDb, and 1 hour and 54 minutes on my VHS copy. This DVD is 1 hour and 45 minutes.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|I think this is the best of the series and Chevy is in top performance as Clark! Cousin Eddie is just the best cousin anyone would want to have!
1781162646|5.0|When Stephen King is able to control his propensity for long-winded books, and keep his narrative arc to a tight crisp line, his books can be terrific.  In 'Joyland' King delivers his best edited yarn in memory, with absolutely no wasted space meandering here or there.  This story whisks the reader back to the early 1970s, and brings us into the world of the summer amusement park.  The main character and narrator has taken a summer job at one, and through his eyes we learn secrets of the trade, and find out about a ghost in the haunted house...a ghost whose murdered is still on the loose...and wouldn't you know it, our narrator wants to solve the crime.<br /><br />This is a mesmerizing read that had me hooked from page one, and disappointed when I had to put it down to go to work, coach baseball, go on a date...This is a great book by one of the all-time masters.
B008X9Z37A|4.0|This case is not anything great but it protects my kindle.  It would be better if it had a closure of some sort and the cover slides when it is open.
B008KE3960|4.0|Wasn't what I was expecting but it's very addicting. Fairly typical tower defense type game where you draw lines for our planes to attack the incoming tanks on the roads. I love that it saves where you were at in the game when you exit. Not just the level, but exactly where you were at. Nice touch. I enjoy games like this one as it is challenging, but not mentally taxing. Simple to learn and simple controls. (A finger is all you need.) I'm sure I'll enjoy this one for a very long time.
145470246X|5.0|I love it. Projects are amazing. Some are for more talented people than myself. Always make sure you have supplies available in your area before starting a project.
B00340ESIS|5.0|Great book.  It is well worth the price and it an excellent book to keep on hand for script writers.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a neat puzzle game but levels are a little repetitious. They could change create different challenges. But overall I enjoyed the game.
B00D5O7BPU|3.0|Good app wish it had more weapons and at least had targets to shoot or something. But for the most part it is not bad for a ww2 weapons app.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|THIS GAME IS SO FUN. I PLAY IT DAILY! I can't live without it.<br />I haven't found any other bingos as good as this one.
B00D8OHPF8|5.0|The new Joe album....... %^$&&&! I said to myself that this must be weak. Wrong! Joe, I have much respect for you! Not only did your change up your style you place it in a way that you knew would benefit your vocals. Double Back is perfection! I can't put it in any other way! He took an old vintage sound twisted it up with a flavor that you must hear. While using live instruments and smooth vocals, he recreated in my opinion a new sound. He has a classic duet with Fantasia that will be played for a long time. He took the 70's atmosphere and placed you into a time museum of R&B utopias. That is the only way I can explain it. The only cut that I didn't care for that much was Magic City outside of that this album will be played in my radio for a long, long time. If you liked the Signature album, this album will definitely have you shaking your head again!<br />Joe, I have heard a lot of artist and I will say that you are in the elite top 5 bar none! I just wish that you and R. Kelly could put aside your differences and make a duet album! I would call EASY NIGHTS! This album is another classic!
B004X75RK4|4.0|This movie was fun and entertaining.  It had some quirky and funny twists  Sandra  Bullock and Ryan Reynolds had great chemistry
B0067AC5KA|5.0|Good character and good plots.  Can't wait to see the movie version.  If you read the first book, you have to read all 3 books, each book gets better.
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|Fun dynamic between our sister and brother heroes.  Very cheesy, with almost no character or plot development, but still a cute movie.
B0054SMID0|4.0|This movie was great. The characters were much more complex than from initial introduction.  The plot development kept us interested and engaged...
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|Not as good as the last one, but a fun evolution of Bruce Willis as mentor in addition to bad ass.
0740797719|5.0|When my son was young, we got him the Gurney book on dinosaurs.  It was a fantastic book that opened his world to black and white art as well as supported his love of dinosaurs.  He has used this book to enhance his video game design work.
B00243FQFA|5.0|great use of the personality mix, plenty of plot, and a fun ending that brought the series home with a great conclusion.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|The album I would not necessarily buy for the other songs, though I've grown to like t hem.<br />But MIRRORS is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard.<br />Congratulations to him for writing something so wonderful.  Jessica Biel should be a happy girl!

1118488768|5.0|What's the difference between the 1st and 4th edition of David Meerman Scott's \\"The New Rules of Marketing and PR?\\"<br /><br />In 2006, Scott predicted the emergence of a communication environment where \\"big\\" no longer conferred inherent advantage; where instead sincere and compelling content would resonate, no matter where it came from. He theorized why the weasel-word tone of corporate comms would no longer cut it. Before Twitter and Facebook were even on the radar, he envisioned an era where social media would lead to lightning-fast changes in reputation: obscurity to fame or fame to notoriety overnight. Not everyone believed him.<br /><br />Now the world that Scott predicted is undeniably here, and the 4th edition powerfully outlines how to thrive in it. Steal it if you have to, but read this book -- especially if you're still spitting out weasel-speak like, \\"this call may be monitored for quality assurance purposes.\\"
B00BIRRDZ4|4.0|This collection of songs showecases the remarkable talents of Dawes with a<br />solid effort. It took about three or four plays (of the whole album) over a few days<br />before the &#34;earworm&#34; factor set in and I found myself waking up with Dawes lines running through my head.<br />The writing is tight and the melodies are pleasant. I think we'll see this as a kind of plateau<br />for Robbie Goldsmith and I'm sure he'll be doing more and better. It's been said way too often, but if you're new to Dawes<br />you'll likely hear vintage Jackson Browne in tone, cadence, melody, creativity and sensitivity -- and that's all to the good. Goldsmith<br />brings Browne into the next century with no loss of quality, purity or character. And if you get the opportunity to<br />catch Dawes live in concert, don't miss it. Some energy,emotion and electricity are meant to be appreciated in person. Go for it.
B000FBJFSC|3.0|McCourt writes in a fashion that flows with no quotation marks and a style that is that of a storyteller sitting next to you in the room by the fireplace.  I found the book interesting to a point but somewhat depressing.
B00C81AVNU|5.0|Wonderful CD with a talented cast that brings the material to life.  Cyndi Lauper did a great job with this musical!  Plus, Lola's songs are pure show-stopping numbers!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|It's a good read. I hear the movie is really dark. It's nice to see something so well written and discuss how a family deals with mental illness.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Easy to use, just log in and enter my password and user name. Can do the same on the go as I can at home.
B00847KFDS|5.0|A great mix of music and performers. John Fogarty shows his great songwriting and performs classics with some great vocalists.
B004UJTG6Q|3.0|At first I didn't in now what to expect, seemed pretty dull filling after reading further, Tom's adventures were too curious  to just give up on
0425263924|5.0|I loved all three books.  I would definately recommend all three to be read.  Not a disappointment at all.  very good
B00CE03UOC|4.0|This is a new twist on the original Flow. Not as challenging as Bridges, but still fun. Can't wait for the next version.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|I've done the 28 days, and I will honestly say that this book has changed my life.  It's worth a read!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Good,fun, addictive, good graphics, makes you think, little complicated, keeps you brain working, passes time by, you can play with other people.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I found myself constantly suprised by twist and turns in the plot but i must say i was highly frustrated by the lack of justice in any form with this story! It haunts me but honestly it reminds me of real life where there really rarely is true justice.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Excellent story. Didn't want to put the book down. Can't wait to start the next one. Suzanne Collins is a great author.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Had a good time playing this game!  Can't wait for more levels to come out! Will definitely play this game again.
0552769762|1.0|The book I received Is old and not the same edition! totally different with the image in the web page!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love it<br />Highly recommend watching this show to learn more about the history of Europe<br />My favorite movies are \\"period\\" pieces and this was like watching 7 movies!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|free easy and works that simple check it out ! works great bla bla bla you still reading this you need help its a calculator it works its free test it out!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game that's not too easy but not so hard that I get frustrated and stop playing. I really like solving the puzzles to get the clue or object to move from level to level.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|its an awesome game.  It gets you to think about things and how to do them. I just love this game.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Cooper, Lawrence and De Niro make a great lead cast. It's not your run of the mill story or romantic comedy. It brings to mind Benny and Joon from a decade ago, but more real, raw, and relatable. It's got family dynamics and relationship truths, along with a little bit of dancing. The movie may hit home more so for people who have had a partner pass too soon, who are bipolar or have some uniqueness that sets them apart from society or their family, and it is to this audience that the movie speaks the most, though everyone will benefit from the message of hope, triumph self-acceptance, opening up and moving forward. Great for a weekend movie night. I'd buy it if it were $10 and I think it should be cheaper than a $5 rental.  I'd give it 4.5 stars, between &#34;like&#34; and &#34;love.&#34;
B008220BLG|5.0|I read the book after seeing the previews at the movies and I loved the book. When I saw the movie I loved it. I thought it stuck to the book pretty good, there were some changes but they were minor. My sister, who has not read the book but saw the movie, loved it. We were both cracking up throughout it, a great zombie rom-com (two words I thought I would type). EDIT: I have now seen this movie two more times, it is still funny. The bonus features are great also.
B00B29J0I6|3.0|Ok when it was free app if the day.  Found it to be buggy..  Sometimes in the middle of playing, the screen will go black and lock.  Had to unlock device.  Also, on the third mission set,  sometimes the bomb boxes disappear when pressed other times not.  There are also times iI either of the two characters were pressed,  they would disappear.  Normal?  Don't know.  But wasn't consistent from game to game playing the same level.  Not a horrible thinking game,  but I won't be keeping it on my device.  Galaxy s4.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|Great for parents as well as kids. My wife and i needed a laugh and the minions provided just that. I would recommend to all.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|It's Indiana Jones. What's not to love? I've been wanting to own the whole collection for a while now and it was a such a great price I couldn't pass it up.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Quartet<br /><br />Steeped in royal-like grandeur, retiring to Beecham House is like spending the rest of one's days living a carefree lifestyle of grand opulence (fresh country air, vast grounds for gentle strolls and quietude), surrounded by like minded people, doing what one so loved doing all of one's life -- in this scenario, music.<br /><br />\\"Beecham House is abuzz. The rumor circling the halls is that the home for retired musicians is soon to play host to a new resident. Word is, it's a star. For Reginald Paget (Tom Courtenay), Wilfred Bond (Billy Connolly) and Cecily Robson (Pauline Collins) this sort of talk is par for the course at the gossipy home. But they're in for a special shock when the new arrival turns out to be none other than their former singing partner, Jean Horton (Maggie Smith). Her subsequent career as a star soloist, and the ego that accompanied it, split up their long friendship and ended her marriage to Reggie, who takes the news of her arrival particularly hard. Can the passage of time heal old wounds? And will the famous quartet be able to patch up their differences in time for Beecham House's gala concert? \\"<br /><br />Quartet is absolutely Charming, with a few gentle twists! :)<br /><br />Does Quartet sound like what you may be looking for? :)  Highly Recommended!  --Katharena Eiermann, 2013
0316017930|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell gives his readers a brand new and better perspective on phenomena which we thought we already understood (but didn't).  I really didn't know that geniuses also have to work hard to perfect their areas of genius. Gladwell shows us that anyone who wishes to do great things must put in his or her 10,000 hours of sweat.  Bravo!!!
B006WXHJVC|5.0|What can you say about a guy who has sex with<br />an apple pie! Great movie...loved it. After this one you<br />have to get the rest of them.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|A funny and charming adventure in physics with lots of surprises. Unexpectedly 're-playable with multiple characters plus multiple levels plus athletic powers to won to ramp up the action. Try it out!
B0041G67YW|4.0|The movie is great start to finish, The more you watch the more you see.<br />4 stars ,a classic! Must have for collection.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|This is a fast-paced and gripping story that lures you in from page 1. You don't want to miss it!
B004ZJZPWA|3.0|Thought it would be better than it was. It was okay<br />Its like he had to do so many movies quickly.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|GREAT, GREAT. GREAT.  EXCELLENT ACTING AND STORY TELLING. DO NOT MISS UNLESS YOU CAN'T YOU CANNOT WRAP YOUR YOUR BRAIN AROUND SOMETHING INNOVATIVE,
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Truly a great app.  All the information you need about your batteries condition plus estimated run times for many applications.  I too believe in paying for work well done and this app definitely qualifies.
B004LDLCDG|5.0|Please don't ask me to write at least 20 words when I don't want to take the time to even do the review.  Cutting and pasting into all my reviews.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|It was a fun game to play with my son. I thought the game was going to be longer since you pay $4.99 after the free session was over.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Story line continues to impress with period clothing, vehicles and way of life.<br />The family and servants portray a portrait gallery of emotions, backstabbing and plain drama.<br />Love every moment and cant wait for the next.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I am a 14 year old girl and I love this game I think more girls should play this game
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|I liked the last one better, (how can you beat crashing into a helicopter WITH A CAR?), but this DIE HARD also lived up to the series name!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is amazing. It's like I have my own live horse<br />Love this game<br />You all should get this game
B007IK44CK|5.0|Loved it. His equipment failed,  his plan went awry,  there was infighting on his team. Really an action comedy.  The suspense was excellent.  This group of actors aced it.
B003QCCS36|4.0|There aren't a lot of musicians better than Ray LaMontagne. This album is a pleasure from start to finish. Highly recommended.
B008Y7N7JW|2.0|As my husband said at the end of the film &#34;That's another two hours of my life I'll never get back!&#34;<br />There had been so much hype about this movie and the novel on which it was based.  When we found it available on Amazon prime, we decided &#34;Oh, what the heck! Let's see what all the fuss was about.&#34;  Further,  Jennifer Lawrence at the head of the cast made the film seem worth watching.  But this film is not even in the same universe as &#34;Silver Linings Playbook.&#34;<br />&#34;Hunger Games&#34; falls int the same adolescent genre as the &#34;Vampire Diaries.&#34;  It's just not for mature movie tastes..
B0002S947K|5.0|It's hard to argue that Ray LaMontagne is a master musician, and this album is his best in my opinion. Highly recommeded!
B006OAB432|5.0|This album is awesome on vinyl and the record came new, just as expected. No scratches, cracks or breakage during shipping. It came in the amount of time I expected as well. I'm very very happy with it. :)
B002VRZEYM|4.0|It's unsurprising to see the entire food industry controlled by only a few giant corporations. The film takes you deep inside how and what they feed us every single day though, and that part of the story tends to leave quite an impression.
1451696191|5.0|After looking at all the reviews and positive feedback for this book, I want to make something clear. Often times, people may find that a book is talked up so much that it becomes overrated, and once you read it, it's not everything you hoped it would be.<br /><br />This is not the case.<br /><br />Believe me when I say that this book will change your perspective on the meaning of love, how to approach love, and how to learn to love. There is a love that is more powerful than a romantic love. Friendship.  After reading this, it made me realize how underrated \\"friendship\\" actually is.  In this day and age, people's significant others are everything.  And don't get me wrong, they are important too, but friends will always be there through thick and thin.  This book will open your eyes while at the same time allowing Charlie to tackle the underlying demons that the past has granted him.<br /><br />Whether you are a high school student or an adult, Perks of Being a Wallflower won't disappoint. When you flip through the last 10 pages you have an epiphany like none other.  READ IT! (:
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Had a ton of fun playing this game with my daughter.  I recommend this game to people of all ages.
B004SBX112|5.0|I like ad-free and the speed and ease of playing this game. As it's predecessors, this is just as addictive and fun to play. Highly recommended for anyone who likes any version of Angry Birds!
B008OM0EDO|4.0|I'll admit , it was a bit offensive to some ethnic groups but once you get past all that , the laughs are nonstop !
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I really love playing diamond dash ,it is so much fun. The extra bonus attractions is great,the bomb,the time and the color splash. I am waiting on more.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Pretty fun. You get to make the park however you want. The code red button is pretty cool too. My son loves all the dinosaurs I just wish it was easier to get more.
B0066WJLU6|4.0|This is a neat app, but since the Kindle Fire does not have a flash it uses the screen as the light source. It lights up a dark room, and you can change the color of light on the screen.
B00CDXOXB4|5.0|I'm usually not into sappy love stories, but was stranded on a sixteen-hour flight to Hong Kong with limited options, and the flight attendant recommended this movie. So glad she did.  I LOVED it!  Watched it twice on the plane and purchased it on Amazon Instant Video when I got home.  It's not overly cheesy or melodramatic, the characters are quite relatable and the end is fantastic. Certainly not earth-shattering, but it is very, very good.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like this game for my daughter it keeps her quite so no complaints from me lol.....the only thing now is that she wants a real horse...................................<br />But in all its a pretty good game for kids
B00AREIAI8|4.0|very good ecsept for energy. that is what I think about my houers. this game is very fun totack epics of my house
B006AZZPCM|4.0|This app is nearly perfect except for one small detail. Whenever you watch a video in full screen mode the kindle option tab stays on the side of the screen, and becomes a real eye sore. This is the only flaw with this app, and if it is fixed the app will no doubt be the best YouTube viewer that I have ever used (even better than the original YouTube app). Please developers, if you read this review I hope that you will fix this problem and make the app perfect. :)
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love pinterest but if you have a small screen it is not practical. I have it for my Kindle fire and it works well with that. I can make the pins bigger if I like it I can pin it with ease. The only problem I have run across is it takes a while to load new pins.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|Not the worst action movie ever made, even though Tom Cruise appears to have phoned it in. He could literally do this role in his sleep, and may have. He's the Punisher minus the bulletproof car and oversized weapons.<br /><br />Basically, it's a good action flick when there's nothing else to watch and you can't muster up enough motivation to attack the &#34;to do&#34; list.<br /><br />Don't spend it all in one place, Tom!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|If you are on the go and want to update status or add a picture this is a good app. On my samsung galaxy it is set up for easy use.
B000KKPN5C|4.0|So far works great!<br /><br />Easy to work with it, very handy, you could have some problems with vertical shots, just use a good diffuser and problem solved.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|One of the best movies I have had the pleasure of watch in my Kindle Fire. It had all the emotions . I was told by a friend about this movie and so I just had to see what all the raving was about that she did about it and all her ravings was spot on.  If you have never seen it, buy, rent it whatever JUST SEE IT!
B00APJLFEG|4.0|I ordered this movie so I would have something to watch on my plane rid.  It was so cute and very entertaining
B001VU1NJ0|5.0|This movie was not purchased but I watched it on my Kindle Fire while I still had a Trial of PRIME.  It was such a great movie it was worth a second viewing.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|The 10 dollars for the full version was worth it because this game is one of the best card games I ever played.
B008OOYALE|3.0|Pretty good.  I just don't like when the games require help from others.  It would rock if you didn't need help from others.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|Good graphics, fun to play, seems to have quite a few levels (I'm still on the first<br />campaign.) Surprisingly free! Well worth the download time.
B0050DZN4K|3.0|I do like the reader, but Google at least showed how many pages were left. I think I need a tutorial on how this works vs Google Reader. I also have no way of knowing if all of my pages transferred over. I guess I will get used to it!
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Well written, and paced. Took me only the pages to get kicked in. I want more from this author and this world
B003B02OOG|5.0|There is such a ring of truth in these stories!  You can feel everything and everyone that Grisham describes.  As much as I enjoy his novels, it is here, in the short story format, that he not only excels, but that he surpasses and transcends even himself!
B000TU16GS|5.0|I think it was awesome so many cool gadgets I wish I had them barely a lull in the action
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I was very surprised by this movie. I know it won some Academy Awards but usually I don't like those movie but this one, very good!
B003YL4KS0|1.0|Way too complicated, do not buy. Don't waste your time. Taking care of my curls the way I have been (:
B009XIXVU6|4.0|The characters were richly described.  The one flaw was that I wanted to know more about what happened to each of them.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|For all of you who have been wishing - nay, craving - for a feel-good zombie movie, this one's for you: WARM BODIES scavenges several genres to bring you just the right touch of supernatural sentiment. It's a comedy wrapped in a romance wrapped in the slowly revitalizing flesh of not-quite-too-dead zombies.<br /><br />As you might have learned, WARM BODIES concerns the story of young R (get it? Arrrr-r-r!), who narrates his tale of transformation and rebirth with a little whimsy thrown in. It seems that some zombies - well, those who haven't yet reached the stage of skeletonization - are starting to notice changes in themselves. R (played by Nicholas Hoult of [[ASIN:B00CISAPJS Jack the Giant Slayer]]) and M, his friend (Mmmmm....get it?) are beginning to realize they are experiencing thoughts and the desire to express them, though their mouths are not cooperating...just yet.<br /><br />It's in the midst of a minor zombie vs. humans battle at the start of the movie that an interesting thing occurs: not only is R's life spared by the woman looking at him through her gun sights (apparently due to his moonpie eyes...natch), but his consumption of her boyfriend's brain sparks romantic thoughts in HIM, and these tender thoughts drive R not only to want to get to know her better, but to protect her as well. When he escorts her to his [[ASIN:B003QTSMXE Wall-E]]-like airplane home base, where we find he's been wrestling with the humanities for awhile: the plane is full of little human trinkets like snow globes and old vinyl LPs that he gathers along his semi-staggering wanderings.<br /><br />Well, of course, complications ensue. Most notably, it turns out Julie, the girl he has rescued (played by Teresa Palmer of [[ASIN:B002ZG99KO The Sorcerer's Apprentice]]) is the daughter of the leader of The Human Army (or something LIKE that, anyway) played by a very humorless John Malcovich. Since the humans are hiding behind a rather HUGE wall in their efforts to stem their seemingly hopeless losing streak, it's going to be up to Julie and R to convince her dad that the \\"warm\\" zombies are changing, and worthy of saving.<br /><br />None of this really has to make sense; what does matter is that this pleasant movie just misses being a whole lot of fun. Director and writer Jonathan Levine, who based his movie on the book of the same name by Isaac Marion, has a lot of good comic stuff going on, but it tries so hard to be just a little violent, and just a little romantic, that it lacks just a little humor. It wouldn't have taken much to make it an off-the-wall comedy or an equally zany romance, but unfortunately it is just too little of each.<br /><br />For instance, having R and Julie meet under her balcony (R and Julie-t...get it?) is a nice, subtle touch, and having Rob Corddry co-star as M is good, too - but not much is done with those assets. Hoult has a great face, and some good comic sensibilities, but I felt he was being held back...probably unavoidably, as zombies can't really show much expression. But his airplane lair never really developed into anything, and there are other little moments similarly missed throughout: one funny when R teaches Julie to walk like a him in order to blend in with his pack he actually has to tone down the zombie in her. Again, it's good for a laugh or two, but goes no further.<br /><br />Regardless, even though WARM BODIES is more cute than comic, it's still fun, and I did enjoy it. It's a sweet, loveable movie all around, and great for a nice evening together cuddled on the couch.hopeless losing streak, it's going to be up to Julie and R to convince her dad that the \\"warm\\" zombies are changing, and worthy of saving.<br /><br />None of this really has to make sense; what does matter is that this pleasant movie just misses being a whole lot of fun.

B009ZXT4BY|3.0|It needs more time! It only let play play for like 10 min!  If it had 45 min for time It<br />Would be 5 stars instead of 3.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Could not wait till I finishes game 1just to see what game 2 would be like. The levels are very challenging-but fun. Great job to the people who developed such a fun and challenging game. Can't wait till next set of free games. Thanks MoblGrow for making this a free game.
B005LAIGN2|5.0|Used copy was in excellent condition. No issues with it being a used copy. Case, art work and, most importantly, the DVD disc were excellent.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This was the 3rd book of a series and I truly enjoyed reading it.  I would recommend this book be put on your reading list!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging fun addictive can not wait for more updates. Love it. Tricky when not all tools found are used hurry with updates please
B00COGY2P2|4.0|In all, his was a pretty typical police procedural. While the methods of Jack Reacher (the man) are anything but typical, that was really the only thing keeping this movie from getting 3 stars from me.<br /><br />Having never read the books, my perspective is a little different than some other who say Tom Cruise surprised them in this role. I wasn't too surprised with his performance. While his presence doesn't make me want to see the movies he stars in, he generally does well with his acting. This film was no different. I found him to be a cross between Vincent (his character from 'Collateral') and Ethan Hunt (a la Mission Impossible 3).<br /><br />The plot was a form of what we've seen many times before, but it worked okay.<br /><br />I don't know that this is one I would pay to see again, but if it were on TV and nothing else were on, I'd watch it.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|Great cast, great movie. Lots of action and suspense. Continues in the Mission Impossible tradition. I highly recommend this movie.
B003MC5N28|5.0|Love love this book!! First time reading it (most people read it in school and I am in my late 20's)! The book makes you think about life, emotions, and many other things.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Seriously, amazing book. As long as you have some nerd in you, you'll love it. Tell all your friends about it.
030789701X|5.0|From character builds to maps of the smallest area, this guide has it all.  I would recommend it to everyone.  There is so much knowledge and advice that you shouldn't be playing this game without it.  I seems overwhelming, so don't try and read it.  You don't have even following it.  Just play the game and if you get stuck on something, have a question, or are curious about something in the game, just look it up!  Awesome.
B006FTC6ZC|5.0|It is a great move. I really liked it. It all so was shipped fast. Was happy when it came got it a day a head of time.
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|The product arrived quickly and works like a dream. Others have not taken in to account that this is not cutting. You are scoring and then control breaking it. I collected a ton of wine bottles because you will have some that will not break even. I sat down and cut 20 at one time and only 5 broke uneven the others were perfect. A little tip. Go around the bottle twice. Use the boiling pot of water and ice bucket method. Only swirling alternating for about 10 seconds and alternating. Only submerge to the score line. I tried to use the method where you slowly pour hot and then cold water and I had a terrible time with them all breaking. Here is the YouTube video that I followed and I had better luck with this method. If you are going to use the pouring method it's hard to do by yourself because you need to be able to turn the bottle quickly, which is why when I tried I failed. The product is easy to assemble it comes labeled and has pictures. Good luck with your crafts everyone. For the money this product is a steal and reliable.<br /><br />[...]
B002RI9YCI|4.0|A fun and well written romp with the Queen of England. A good afternoon read or for a plane or the beach.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This bag fits my need to a &#34;T&#34;. It can hold one DSLR body with a 18-55m lens attached as well as hold my 24-70mm, 70-200m, a 60m macro, flash unit, extra batteries, and filters. It has ample pockets for miscellaneous items to keep pens, a small note pads, lens cleaning tissue, hand wipes, etc. The construction is built to last and comes with a great price. I would recommend this backpack to other photographers who has the same equipment and lenses or who is starting and looking into adding on. The only item I see is that it can use is a water bottle holder.
B00A1OZBSQ|5.0|So revealing how we are all eating much more salt, sugar and fat than we realize and how we are manipulated by the food industry. It is no coincidence that Kraft, one of the largest food conglomerates is owned by Phillip Morris the cigarette company. Although there are some signs of corporate responsibility now in their policies, just like the results of smoking these large corporations should be held accountable for the related health costs including diabetes and obesity. Also a wake up that we should eat food we prepare ourselves and not processed by others. Buying locally produced food would be beneficial as well.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I was surprised by this game.  It was a refreshing change of pace.  I am looking forward to more rooms.  This game kept me busy for days.
B0007TKNII|5.0|Great story, great music, superb casting. Only opera my 8 year old will watch with me. Though in &#34;movie&#34; format, this stays true to the stage play.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another great Grisham novel.  From the start you can not put it down and has all the little twists and turns throughout the book.  Read this book, you won't be disappointed!
B006GHA9QQ|4.0|Good, not great. But then again how many sequels are? Music is beautiful (of course), casting was ok. Liked it over all.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I liked this game a lot. However the instructions for play could be better and it sometimes took multiple \\"touches\\" to pick up items or open doors, etc. Not too easy so it actually took some thought to get through. Pretty good game for free. I would recommend it.
B0007939NO|3.0|the quality of the movie was great!<br />this could have been an animation in this day and age !  the music and acting were good!
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|After seeing this movie we simply must own it!  The action was awesome.  The story was awesome.  The graphics and special effects were great!  Everything went together quite well to make a wonderful movie.
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|there's nothing bad to say about the dvd, movie, music and acting~ it was ALL GREAT!  i love all her movies!!
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|My husband and I had been wanting to see this movie, and once we did we were every disappointed in the ending.  There needed to be a little more clarification.
6305320802|3.0|the quality was great and the movie was good...the story was a bit predictable, so i wasn't that amuzed, however, i love the music!
B00ATPVA78|5.0|Simple point and click interface without ads or being pestered to buy things. The game has a hint system so its easy tomoce forward if you get stuck.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|A must for the Indiana Jones fan.  Though, the movies were released several months as individual movies; I wish I would have waited as I don't care for the last film.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I watch Game of Thrones on HBO, yet there are some areas that leave questions.  These books fill in the answers and go into more depth of the characters.
0062014536|4.0|I was really excited for this book to come out. I was completely hooked on the first 2 in the series. The book overall was great but the ending was very disappointing. There wasn't really a conclusion and I felt like it left me hanging as much as the second book did. I was honestly pretty upset over the ending for a few days.
B000KIPT30|3.0|I purchased this to monitor incoming vinyl transfers into Protools through Sony 7506 and KRK headphones. It did a very good job, but it does have some sound degradation when listening to 24/96 hi res music. (mostly in sound space and dynamics-things people who grew up with MP3's have no clue what I'm saying). For 90% of people this will be excellent-it's quiet enough, very compact and seemed built well for a $20 item. But I ended up returning it and getting the Presonus HP4 which (for 5x the $) obviously blows this away.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very addicting!  Each level is unique and interesting.  A fun way to keep your brain sharp.  Puzzles are creative and challenging.  Love it!
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Several years ago, I decided to pick up running again. I used to run 1600s in high school but was never particularly good.<br /><br />I decided that I would shoot for a half marathon, checking of smaller goals of a 5k and 10k along the way. I went to the running store, got some nice light running clothes and a few pairs of shoes that they recommended for my foot type (super flat feet, over-prorater).<br /><br />I never was able to break past 8 or 9 km runs. I would get severe knee pain that would make even walking difficult. After trying even more extreme stability shoes and physical therapy, I renounced running in favor of biking.<br /><br />When I talked with my physician though, he recommended this book to me. It changed everything for me.<br /><br />It pushes natural, edging on barefoot, running. I started to run barefoot for a week in soft grass. It went very well. Then, I laced up my old running shoes and ran in that style on pavement.<br /><br />Within a few weeks, I am racking up ~10 km every day without problems. We will see how this goes in the long term, but for now I am sold.<br /><br />This book is fantastic. I fully recommend it to anyone who is somewhat interested in running but has run into issues based on motivation, injury, or age. It will tackle any and all of those concerns.
B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|Could be more challenging.  More for kids . Cool graphics.  Could have a better way to shoot the marbles then having to pull the bow back.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|Fun for a while.  Instructions not in depth for someone who has never payed Mahjong before.  Figured out most of it.
B0067R0APK|2.0|I LIKE THE FREE ONE! Much better.It is easier to read and visually better, the weather is alright I guess.
B00821OW8K|5.0|I am completely unbiased. Check my reviews. This is the best post-apocalyptic show out. Better than Walking Dead. Amazing show with deep plot lines crossing multiple areas but realistic. Check it out
B0064MPXFA|4.0|They managed to find a way out of the weekly crime drama with way-too-young hot shot lawyers who manage to upstage their elders on the bench and in the office..  They still have that, but as the backdrop to the ongoing story of a marriage destroyed by distrust and infidelity, and a state's attorney whose career has been torpedoed by his enemies, and who is simultaneously trying to stage a political comeback, find out who set him up, and save his marriage.  The crime and trial of each episode allow us to learn more about our heroine, well played by Julianna Margulies, and about her colleagues and the inter-office competition at the law firm.  Well recommended.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|It's great to read a book that shows that to all love is normal. That your aren't supposed to have the happily ever after like in the movies. It's okay for things to go wrong. And that no relationship is perfect, and if you look for that, you may never be happy.
B00BLSJI80|5.0|This was everything I wanted and nothing I was expecting. She has grown so much since her first album and I love the product of DEMI. If I had the money, I'd buy it again.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it's fun and addictive but what I love most about it is that you can actually learn how to train a horse!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Loved the story line and plot is great.  Graphics was amazing. Love it, love it and love it! Yes yes
159562015X|3.0|I ordered the StrengthsFinder 2.0 for a continuing credit class for my County Treasurer's Association.  The book was easy to read and understand, and I found the self-test to be pretty much on target.  It gave me some food for thought.  In the big picture, it is simply another way to come at the same old question of personality differences, how to recognize them, and how to work with them, but it was more user friendly than most.
0071373586|5.0|Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind, by Al Reis and Jack Trout, is a classic how-to book for marketing with timeless lessons. It wasn't until a ways into the book that I realized how old the book was. Some of the examples used truly date the book. These dated examples may date the concepts, but not their worth. It is interesting to note the successes and failures of companies, politicians, and products predicted in the book and how the history for each played out.<br /><br />I had not realized how important positioning was in business and ones personal life until reading this. This book was an easy and fun read, but still packed with enlightening information that reigns true despite the changes in the world. It uses history and \\"current events\\" to express and better explain theories and practices which can be extraordinarily useful. It also explains what not to do and why.<br /><br />Though long, and somewhat redundant, their message is clear and heard throughout their book. Various examples assure that every possibility is explained and expounded upon. I highly recommend this book for those beginning in not only advertising or marketing, but any business.
B004KBSQBA|4.0|When I purchased this collector quality version of Graceland. My concerns were sound reproduction from vinyl to CD. I am satisfied this version was worth the money. The sound is close to vinyl. A few tracks, such as  Diamonds on the sole of her shoes. Seems to be a little faster tempo and more pronounced vocals. Unlike the original vinyl offering the slower tempo and more pronounced African instruments . However. It is still very close.and far better than later reproduced versions I have heard. I am glad I was abke to get this collectors copy.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Very good game I love the big monkey and the mine shaft's.The gems are hard to get  I love the saying like &quot;lucky I have a hard head&quot;
B006VGGAC4|5.0|Awesome man he is really motivational. I would love to meet him someday and talk to him about his life.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I did like this book greatly and would definitely read again!<br />One of the best books I've ever read I loved the story line and the author left no questions unanswered! Can't wait to read the next book! Hoping it will be just as good!
B00DCX08MW|3.0|Um I guess it's a pretty cool game the graphics are good the plane fly awesome and the sound is nice
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun and at times challenging game. It makes u think. I like that u have to solve puzzles to get clues. Over all great game. Can't wait for more rooms to escape.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|wife wanted to see and I thought it would be a simple chick flick but it was much more. Bradley Cooper's character was much more complex. You could see the ending a mile away but still there was a slight surprise at the end.
B003TH2LYY|5.0|I recently discovered this show (after 5 years on the air), and I'm hooked. I love the characters, and the stories usually keep me guessing till the end of the show, which I love. Streaming the shows to my computer from Amazon is fun because I'm not used to watching TV on my computer. And the quality is very good. As I said, I'm hooked all the way around! (-;
044024613X|5.0|Mr. Landay's novel not only touched a raw nerve with me, it was plucking away at them like my nerves were harp strings. The protagonist, Andy Barber, and his family's background was disconcertingly similar to mine. My wife and I have also been married for thirty years, have a 14-year-old son, and live in a New England suburb. Heck, we even drive a Honda Odyssey like the Barber family. Mr. Landay's description of suburban life rings very true. The dialogue between parents and son felt like I was listening to our own family. I lost count how many times it sent a chill up my spine to read the dad's thoughts about his son. Also, the nature of school bullying and cliques is very much the lay of the land.<br /><br />Most of the story is written in the first-person narrative of Andy Barber and some portions are court transcripts. It jumps back and forth between what occurred from the point of the murder until its resolution as well as a year later during another grand-jury hearing involving another incident. Andy Barber tries to explain his rational for certain actions he took during his retelling of the events. His hidden animosity towards the prosecutor (a man Barber groomed while he was a district attorney), Neal Logiudice, adds a great deal of tension within the courtroom. There are a few sarcastic observations by Barber that add a modicum of levity, but mostly this mystery is tense as hell.<br /><br />The book spends a great deal of energy covering the social and emotional effects of having a family member accused of murder. The financial, physical and mental toll of defending yourself, guilty or innocent, is at the core of this novel. It is an extremely well-done work that any parent with a soul will find absorbing and frightening.
B0073XORCY|5.0|Although not as favorite as the original...and re-borrowed melodies from other works....I still really enjoyed this CD and look forward to seeing it live this Saturday.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Emotionally trying and devastatingly beautiful story of a girl with a life full of lies and heartbreak but a heart the size of the universe. I love Holder & Sky.
B005T87QCI|5.0|I saw  the note for Xbox and it was a lot better than this won but now<br />they added paint and now it is just as good.
B002KAJ0AO|5.0|As a BSB fan from the beginning, I was definitively not let down by this album.  I really like the songs &#34;If I knew then&#34; and &#34;Shattered&#34; the best.
B006N0YWGY|4.0|The racing is fun and hard to get a perfect score. The trading is fun but to random. Great game overall.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  A great read for people to understand the struggles some people have to go through in life.
0307277887|5.0|It's a fun book that is a real page turner, I'm a big fan of the show ! Love it !
0812984412|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. It has a remarkable structure, with<br />intertwining stories taking place at different times. Fortunately, a<br />friend who had read it told me to, whatever I do, stick with it past<br />the first section, that it would take a bit to figure out what the<br />author is doing, and when I figured it out, I would love it. That<br />was good advice that I would like to pass on.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it but I wish I could install free nods for this game I would so get the weeping angel or dalek mod
B00BJ8SXFG|4.0|Easy to use, but I would like to know how to graph multiple variables..  x and Y.  The equation is always stated as F(x)=
B0062QRTKA|1.0|this game is offensive to christians I didn't even download it all I did was look at the pictures! it isn't even how the bible goes! this is some bull**** and I don't offer it to anyone who is a christian!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I loved the app so much that j can't get off of it and I spend so much time on it can't go bed in time to get up in the mornings.
B009AMANBA|3.0|Daniel Day Lewis is spectacular as always and trying to portray true history while keeping viewers entertained these days is a tough act. I do recommend the movie but I would not set your expextations too high.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This premise was a lot of fun!  Just wish the sex was not so explicit.  I loved the characters and ll the angst!
B000002LQR|4.0|Of course this album is great and for a great price. My only issue was that the case was slightly cracked when it got hre, but since I am not a collector type music junkie it was okay. This probably happened in shipping however.
B00847KFDS|5.0|I use this music at the gym as I exercise.  I especially like the Proud Mary song.  It was a good idea to have different musicians combine with the songs.
B0043ZDU1E|5.0|This CD is great my father loves it. It got here promptly and in perfect condition. Not much more to ask for!
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|I'm really finding that I enjoy this game. It's pretty much just hidden objects which is just what I want. The few other puzzles are a little more challenging but not impossible as I have found in some of the other designers games. With no hints for them it's a game stopper. When that's the case I might as well have just burnt the money. I'm glad this one continues somewhat along the same level increasing only slightly in difficulty. It really is for everyone. I like that I can sit back and relax with this game and just enjoy the search. Thanks for a great, fun, interesting, relaxing game!
B0093BUVPG|5.0|There is nothing like hip hop jazz. The best of both worlds and the best of young confidence within such a powerful arrangements. This LP makes one love music and God for giving us such ears to hear so much beauty.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Loved seeing the bad guys from my favorite video games from when I was growing up. Cute story. great animation. Highly recommend.
B0064SVOTS|5.0|This is much more than a jazz album. This is the epitome of music eternal. An instant classic that will continue to sound new each time one plays it. Complex and yet comfortably relaxing this is the must have of the decade.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|If you have been injured trying to run, I urge you to read this book. Thanks to this book, I gave it a shot and changed my life.
B000003N7F|5.0|Every serious jazz lover must have this in their collection. Especially in vinyl! One cannot say they love jazz without having this album in there collection.
B00BNWWVFG|2.0|The movie started for me about half way through.  Fast forwarded through the set up scenes of depression until the Jude Law character started to get his life back and the movie finally got interesting.<br /><br />Mara's character unpleasant.  Zeta-Jones character unpleasant.<br /><br />But fun to watch the noose tighten around Law's character and then for him to get out.
B00CCEHR80|5.0|As was the case with all JGB shows, Jerry and the band romp through sets of his favorite old time songs.  But the versions are all standouts.  Listen to Jerry's voice on Evangeline, you can hear his love of the song; it's great hearing him in such good spirits.  Set two is the standout set for me, culminating in a Tangled Up in Blue in which Jerry and John Kahn trade licks that will give you chills, maybe even a tear to your eye and leave you in awe.  I can't get enough of this CD.
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|First things first: this is not the Kanye you're used to. If you were expecting this to be just like his other albums, then you might walk away disappointed. This is Kanye at his most raw, his most minimalist, his most experimental. And this album draws heavily on techno themes, almost sounding industrial.<br /><br />This album is some sort of artistic masterpiece, I'm just not quite sure what yet. It's more than an album, it's an experience. The sum is greater than its parts: this is the kind of album that you want to start at track one and listen straight through. It's best to let the music envelop you, played loudly via a surround system or in a car.<br /><br />It might take some time to get used to, but once you do, it's hard to go back to more \\"normal\\" music. This is something brand new and evolved, the next progression.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Perfect addition to the Hobbit Series and was wonderful to watch, don't know if there will be more but will keep looking.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|...for &quot;The Room,&quot; I'm hooked.  Great graphics and as sound effects, clever puzzles.  Need more apps like this for Kindle. I can't wait wait for the next incarnation of &quot;The Room.&quot;  I'm going to give it to my 11year old to play next. He kept trying to steal it from me.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Season 1 was the start of several more great seasons.  Too bad it ended. A few more seasons would have been welcomed.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This game is very challenging and simple at the same time. it is very addictive. It is great for all ages
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I was so excited to hear when the classic movies came out on Blu-ray and that Amazon had a amazing deal on all four movies.
B007SGM084|5.0|If you can skip through all the sex parts, which I did when I read it through the second time, there is a great love story.  This has been the only book that I have read several times.  Love, love, love it!!!  Now just waiting for the movie.
3836538725|4.0|Great book. Would not expect anything less from Salgado. Said this i thing the images are too manipulated. Some more than others.
B003YCI1PM|5.0|Daugher loved it! She's almost 11 now and still listens to this CD. I love everything that Selena Gomez does, she just has a wonderful voice.
0763644765|5.0|I read this book at least a few times a day.  My daughter and I both know it by heart.  Great pictures, great &#34;story&#34;, I would definitely recommend it.
B007EC27QM|5.0|This is one of my apps that I don't use a lot but is there when I need it!  Easy to use and looks great!
B005LAIGW8|4.0|This ghost rider is a sequal to the previous one, but I prefer the other hell cycle that he had in #1, the graphics and special effects are awesome! Me, I don't know much of ghost rider, maybe to comic book fans it wasn't great, but for me that just watches it for the action, its a good one to have.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game, very addictive, easy to understand and play, glad I installed this one. Would highly recommend. Great fun. Great graphics and sound, good range of tasks and activities. Provides many hours of fun. Good for adults and kids alike.
B0013LL2Z2|5.0|This movie was good, a fururistic time where everyone is young. But when they reach a certain age they must \\"renew\\" (sacrifice). That was their tradition, but they get to learn that you can live as long as you want.
0307716554|3.0|The whole idea of \\"Out of Body\\"  knowing what is going on and unable to do anything about it turns me off!!<br />After plowing through several chapters , I find I really do not care what happens.<br />However I will finish it , because I am a little curious!! LOL
B007FROH4G|4.0|Wonderfully written from the first person as it gave great reality to the story, with believable feelings and emotions. Hard to put down.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|This series is much darker than I anticipated (was thinking it might be more like Weeds), but I thoroughly enjoyed it. The acting and writing are superior to many other shows. Reels you right in and keeps you hooked! I've already watched the first two seasons, and I am looking forward to starting the third! Excellent!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a awesome game. If you are a horse lover you should get this game. BEST GAME  YOU SHOULD GET THIS GAME!!!!! :)
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love the game, can be tricky in spots, but highly entertaining. Recommended to friends..extremely addictive, hard to put down.
1417734027|5.0|We need to get more of these, the kids love them. Wish I had one of these books when I was a kid!
B00479SVBU|5.0|This product is worth it, and i would recommend it to any interested buyers. There is no static at all and the sound quality is very clear. I have had mine for more than a month now and I cannot complain about anything
0763619612|5.0|this book is great for you to read aloud to show your students that drawing is a matter of perspective.  It will stop the &#34;I Can't&#34; the &#34;I don't know how&#34;
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Every Rollins book I've read intrigues and enthralls. He brings elements of science and history and possibilities of both that make a person think about what is real and what is not and &#34;what if&#34;
1595826971|5.0|Amazing art book. defiantly recommend for anyone who loves creepy dark art work. Lots of different designs, just wish there were more concept art for the different dresses.
B004R13U6Y|3.0|This app is good but the layout is worst.. Has been a beta tester for PDF Max, it was truly impressive. I am waiting for PDF Max.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|I believe I have read all of Kathy Reichs' novels on Temperance Brennan.  Her attention to detail just fascinates me.  This novel was particularly good as it contained much information on the Indians in the Canadian Northwest Territories. Fascinating!
0307455378|4.0|He leido las primeras 160 paginas del libro y la lectura es una gran aventura. El trama es complicado pero vale la pena explorarlo.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I have read all the Harry Bosch novels and am waiting impatiently for the next one to come out this year.  &#34;The Black Box&#34; grabs you from the first pages and doesn't let you come up for air until the last page.  If you're really into Harry Bosch (as I am), you feel like he's a friend you will never stop caring about. I love intelligent men, so naturally, I love Harry!
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|If your a Mario bros fan this is just as fun and challenging and is similar to Donkey Kong as well. I enjoyed this game very much.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Short but fun! I hope they add more levels! I finished the first ten levels in an evening. Kept a pen and paper handy for writing down clues.
B007UXT6T6|5.0|When Tom is on he's on. Great Performance by Jeremy Renner. I hope he continues to make more in the series.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I watched this movie for the first time about three months ago with my boyfriend.  Since then, we've watched it at least five more times.  I highly recommend this  wonderful and inspiring movie.
B009FAQ9JW|5.0|This is a superb western placed mainly on California's coast at Monterey. The dramatic scenery is great, the acting is great. Brando is the named director though I suspect the director of photography helped out a bit. This is the old revenge story, but is done extremely well and it is much more than that. The subtext, and the arc of this script is this: Brando plays the Rio Kid, who has never been anything but a gunslinging bank robber, liar, and woman chaser. So he falls for the daughter of his arch enemy and it changes him. The love story unfolding is moving. Pina Pellicer is excellent as the daughter, as are the other cast members, Karl Malden, Katy Jurado. There is some violence, though not as excessive as movies today. It is difficult find a good copy of this movie; Paramount gave up the license and lousy copies abound. Amazon's version is better than most, though the color fades a bit. All in all, if you like a good, uncommon western, and you like Brando, this is a very good movie.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|When I first played this game on my iPhone I thought it was going to be the kind of thing that I played a few times and got bored with, but very quickly I wanted to beat levels &amp;  play more and more. It's nice for times when you want something to play that's not too difficult but can be challenging.
B00A8MGIZG|2.0|Ok characters, Muddled story line.  Too much back and forth. Despite top notch actors, just should have been clearer. Sorry.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|My 5 years old daughter requested this app without my authorization. It happened when she was playing another game in to the Kindle. Unfortunately when I saw was too late and I could not cancel...
B00BLF9FOK|4.0|Good watch.  Love the team play.  Good cast and characters.  Had a nice story line. Interesting.  Just the right length.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Its hard to see the pictures and have to go to other page to have more information about the item. But I open this app every day.
B00CRS88IO|5.0|For lovers of nostalgia inspiring, World War 2 era spy novels, The Ian Fleming Files: Operation Armada by Damian Stevenson is your next must read. Whether you are a fan of James Bond, arguably one of the greatest franchises in history, or spy novels in general, you will not be disappointed. Mr. Stevenson definitely knows his subject matter, beginning the novel with a short biography of Ian Fleming, then quickly accelerates into the action. Starting with a morning run to clear his head from a night of alcohol fueled intelligence gathering, the story deftly gathers English intelligence officer Ian Fleming, ruthless Nazis, resistance militia, and a rogue French Armada and sets them against the backdrop of the powder keg of 1940's Europe , where the lines of enemy and ally are blurred. The details of the era are richly described, the writing is riveting and the pace is adrenaline-charged.  Wise cracking spies, beautiful women, inventive gadgets and eccentric villains populate the writing, the usual and beloved suspects for this type of story. Operation Armada had me reminiscing about the first time I watched a James Bond movie, and had me reliving that first feeling of wonder and awe. I highly recommend this book, whether you are a fan of the genre or not.
B004GJDQT8|4.0|Like in the desktop runs good. but in some items are missing information and pictures  if you compare with the full site
B003K16P3M|5.0|The characters are believable, the plot progresses well throughout the story and the world Kristin creates is very imaginative.  Unlike some books, it is easy to picture what is going on in the story without getting lost in an exhaustive explanation.  One of the most enjoyable reads I've had.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This escape game is fun for people who like puzzle games, regardless if you've never played this type before. the first levels were simple for those who have experience in escape the room/level games, but get steadily more difficult. l can't wait until they add more levels!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|An amazing tale of the myriad of human interactions in a harsh reality; the intense emotions that accompany life with a variety of characters.
B00B2TTVNU|4.0|Valentina Lisitsa has been working on this project for a long while and has finally brought it to fruition in this wonderful CD.  She has a good feel for Rachmaninoff's music.  Nonetheless, I am not as fond of her performance of these concerti as that of some other performers I've heard along the line (Olga Kern, Stephen Hough, Nikolai Lugansky).  Still worth the price of admission.
159463176X|5.0|Hosseini, as usual...a perfect story teller who explains the essence of the emotional relationship between eastern siblings, parent and child, the importance of belonging and the value of reconnecting with one's roots. emotional and different. covering different aspects of life and human relations and conflicts. I loved it, and his last page is a masterpiece to finish off his amazing work. I just wish I knew more about Abdullah throughout his life and less about Greece.
6305754969|5.0|Been looking for this for years at stores with no luck. Not only did I find it but shipping was fast. It made it in time for Father's Day.
B00AEFYVUQ|5.0|This was Woody's only movie that he honed first as a Broadway play, and it shows.  I saw it in theaters four times as a double-bill with Catch-22 (which made a surprisingly good pairing.)  Always my favorite Woody Allen movie, until Stardust Memories came along, I bought this for my son to see, and it immediately became his favorite Woody film too.
0007466064|5.0|Awesome; just what you would expect from George R. R. Martin and his epic series. You can forget the spoilers ... You won't be getting any from me. Buy your own copy. :P
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Reading this as the mother of a son upon which I dote, this was a sad topic at times, but it poses a question that I've wondered about when I've seen horrible things on the news:  what do you do when you think your child is not only capable of something horrific, but guilty of something horrific?  The parents in this story have two different views of their son and of each other.  I don't want to say too much because there are a few twists, some that you can see coming earlier than others.  The twists are what make the book interesting.  It's well written, although slightly longer than I would have liked.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|A drama revolving around the '60s but set to view in the modern world. It is sick, twisted, demented, infuriating ... and I cannot stop watching it. Forget the spoilers; you won't get them from me. Get your own boxset. :P
B006LSZECO|5.0|Did not like the novel.<br />Ending very upsetting<br />Lead characters had no redeeming qualities<br />The plot had a good twist
B0014I4KH6|4.0|That's the song. I love that song. Maybe I should have purchased that song alone. Maybe I should buy a type of device that would allow me to do just that. For fans of country music, you should really enjoy this album. I just happen to be a hardcore girl who became enthralled with a song: 'Teardrops on my Guitar.' :P
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Quartet is a great movie set in England about 4 famous opera singers who find themselves in a home for musicians. They are delightful in this sweet story. There is not mystery, murder or theft to solve, just older performers trying to keep on performing for a very different audience. The cast members are suburb and I really recommend it to all who love a story in a British setting.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Absolutely great read. I read it in one day.  Well written and the characters and plot came alive on each page. If you enjoy historical fiction you will love it.
B004WDRT1Y|4.0|Great purchase for someone who really enjoys the Lion King.  I purchased this item for such a person and they really have appreciated this gift.
B001I45UFC|5.0|This is a children's book, but even as an adult, I enjoyed it! On to The Horse and His Boy!
B00BWJARHO|1.0|First, let me say that I have watched all of the Lord of the Rings Films many times and would rate them five stars.  On the other hand, this is a stupid movie that involves a lot of senseless action and overuse of animation.  The acting is good and the animation is impressive but the movie doesn't hang together as a whole and sucks overall.  If you've actually read the book, you'll hate this movie because it completely butchers the plot (and not for the better either).  Certain characters are made into jokes for comic relief.  It was bad enough when they did this to Gimli in a few scenes of LOTR (one of the few flaws in LOTR) but this is much much worse than that.
B008WHTFL8|3.0|I'm still not sure if these guys are an act or they take themselves seriously. I still havent heard an album from them as good as Permission to Land However.
B00CSSS2V6|5.0|best paul mccarnty album ever. takes me back to the good times in the 70's . good old rock n' roll
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Very enjoyable gameplay. Would like to have more info added after you complete the journey each time.Loved the graphics and the history lesson.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|My husband bought this, and I have played it a couple of times.  I enjoy it, but he definitely loves it.  He is always asking if he can borrow my Kindle so that he can play this game.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game is a way to connect with our childhood memories of this memorable movie. This game also gives us stoning graphics and bright color`s
B009T8XBBO|5.0|Great game! I didn't know how much I would like a time-management game, but this one is awesome! I have spent literally hours playing it, now I have to call the pizza guy to deliver.
B000683VI4|5.0|I'm not much for writing reviews but I just had to say this movie is one of the best romance based movies I've ever seen, highly recommend this one to anyone looking to have a romantic night with their loved one.
B003IWRE3I|4.0|Pretty much everything we have to look forward to. Very good movie and excellent acting. I can't believe this movie didn't make the big time. Then again, Hollywood want touch anything like this or martial law.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|This game has a lot of ups but one downside. The money system, I have spent money on it in one place to get rarity because, I didn't want to wait forever to get there.<br /><br />This is overall a great game. Play it wisely and you will not spend a dime.
B004ELSDZK|4.0|Haven't completed this game yet. The challenges get harder and harder as you get further into the game some levels seem impossible to figure out and there are no hints
B00BC24NT4|4.0|I liked this story.  I am not sure why I have to do a review.  That is all folks.  DVK
B00594XOZU|5.0|Kik me at penniesymone13 I'm a 13 year old female 13 - 16boys only if it over 16 i won't talk to you . I'll probably not trade pics but you never know .other than that I just want to talk .My opinion of kik is it is awesome<br />&lt;3
0547848412|4.0|Great story, weird story, what really happened????  No, I won't spoil it for you, I'll be careful not to give anything away.  It was slow going at first, you're not really sure why you're being told all the info on his family or his teachers.  Once the story really starts you wonder 'who would have created something like this'?  But intrigued you continue until the very end trying to imagine what could happen to this boy.  I will say that the ending left me wondering, but I've chosen to go with the story.  It's masterfully told, thoughtful and mysterious.  I can see why the critics loved it enough to make the movie.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this app, sometimes it can get on my nerves with the freezing up, the wrong movements, and ect
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|Everybody seems to be playing this, it seems to be the game to beat.  I found it boring.  Click on the pile of 3 or more blocks to wipe them off the screen before your time runs out.  Hurry, hurry, hurry, get all of them, the clock's ticking.  I should have paid closer attention before I downloaded it, after all it is call Diamond DASH!
B002ZG975Q|5.0|I chose this rating because of the great quality it has come in . The dvd was brad new and absolutely fabulous !
B004PGAQMW|4.0|I have 2 little kiddos, so we watched this 3 times in one weekend.  It's a good movie, because it held up (was still fun and interesting) each time.  Good dialogue, it's smart, it's good.
B005WLQQ4Q|5.0|even though the Cd came a day late .....I love this Cd to death . It was perfectly sealed , and brand new . The Cd was loud and the voices were very clear and distinct . Also The little booklet in the front where all the songs names are and everything else . If you unfold the whole thing and turn it around it's many different pictures . It's a poster !!! I was like . &#34; Where's the tape !! &#34;  I recommend anyone who loves or even likes BTR  or Big Time Rush to buy this CD !!!!
B0076DELIG|4.0|There is something about Detective Bosch stories that keep you coming back for more.  Michael Connelly has done it again in a twenty year old mystery that seeks to be solved by LA's favorite cold case detective.  Kudos!
B004SBQAN8|5.0|I chose this rating because it came in the best condition possible . The box was brand new and completely sealed . I would recommend this movie to anyone who like a little bit of teenage action and some interesting things . Most of these would be classified as a syfi movie but it's not . It has some aspects of syfi but it is very intruging . I would recommend this to anyone .
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Great Family Movie. High level of action and this movie keeps you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. Loved it.
B001NVIZ3E|5.0|the love for ones country and loyalty ones true king has never been more true  than for robin of Sherwood who fights for justice and those that can't for no reward or glory save that of maid Marion will understand way this movie is old not as flashy or dark as recent ones but its as epic grand and still the best robin hood movie ever
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Even though Clary and Jace are related, I can't help from hoping they get together! Simon is nice and everything, but if Clary can't have Jace, I think she should be with Simon and not Maia! I can't wait to see what else is in store for these Shadowhunters!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like to play solitary. It's fun to play and fun to kill time. You have so many different ways you can play the game.
B00CV5ZPA2|1.0|I was looking forward to kanyes Album to Drop but sadly preferred J.Coles...<br /><br />I know kanye like to try new sounds n' all but he should have kept this to himself!<br /><br />Hope he releases a part 2!
B00A7W29BE|3.0|I have some issues but I believe this is due to the camera on on my RAZR rather than the Genius Scan application.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|very challenging. love the way it makes you think! plus not extremely difficult to solve the floors.would recommend to anyone that loves brain games.
B00499K9E0|3.0|Really, writers?  The writers of this program seemed to have looked for opportunities to insert gay chatter.  Why?  It was forced and awful.  The straight sexual innuendo was uncalled for also, but less obvious and less frequent.  The writers should know that Doyle's characters and ideas will succeed without these strange embellishments.  If not for these extraneous comments in the scenes, I'd give the show five stars.  They do detract from the quality of the performance.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I personally love this app and recommend it to everyone. I only wish that some of the prices could come down.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|down loaded good no problem got my cities that I needed on it ...they send up grades for it at times...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Its amazing game and I love it, but I have one question how do I update the game? Every time I visit a friend it says my friend has an updated version.help anyone?
B004SRPXWQ|2.0|did not like it every time you picked some thing they wanted you to pay for that option so good by I deleted it...
B00181JGI2|5.0|the discourse is wonderful. All types of hilarious words of severe laziness. I would recommend this movie to anyone intelligent.
1416550550|5.0|Nice summer read. Really takes you to the English countryside and gardens. Takes a while before all the twists start to emerge
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Was doing great until I got to the 9 x 9.  I still have two that I can't get and refuse to buy hints.  I will keep working at them.  Fun part is that after you finish the harder ones you can come back a while later and won't remember how you did it the first time so you get to work on it again.
B00CWV8X04|4.0|Pay close attention as the plot unravels very slowly--still a good movie.  Rooney Mara is very talented and the rest of the cast was very good.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This is a great game, keeps you entertained for hours. Easy to catch on but can be addictive. It is also FREE
B001PPLJIQ|5.0|The Reader is such a great movie.  I love the characters and the actors are superb.  Kate Winslet, Ralph Fiennes and David Cross are all wonderful in this film.  It's a provocative and suspenseful movie.  Loved it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is very interesting! Not like 100 floors at all and it makes you think outside the box. Hoping they update soon so I can continue to play!
B000TEVFPQ|5.0|I was glad I came across this in the $5 section.  I already have the CD but I purchased the download because of two song &#34;Who Can I Be Now&#34; and &#34;It's Gonna Be Me&#34;.  I never knew these songs existed.  I guess they were left of the original album due to time limitations. But I really liked the songs and glad I made the purchase.  Great for Bowie fans.
B0063GORYU|5.0|like how many variations are available in set up.  can play fast on easy or make it challenging.<br />good brain workout
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|fave game to played before sleep. helps unwind ur mind. some games r challenging.  stays interesting and it can take a few times trying to get under 5 minutes..
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|It is a wonderful movie. It is funny and heart warming. I think both children and adults can equally enjoy this movie. I am looking forward to Despicable Me 2 to be released.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|It is a good romance to watch and a nice developing story, which at the end ties the movie with a bow.
B00785P2QC|5.0|so fun you earn money pretty fast and it has cars like no other virtual city I love it download it now!!!!!
B00BU8RNCE|3.0|I was disappointed and expected more from Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor. The special effects were very good and you were with them during the tragedy.  I liked how it brought the reality and horror to your tv screen.
B001GCUO1Q|4.0|I love the X men movies and this one gives you a good background story where Wolverine came from and why he is the way he is.  It is pretty violent in parts so not recommended for kids.
B00CBKVGGY|4.0|This is a very entertaining movie and is well made. The heroism is brought to life by Hollywood and they did a good job.  The costume and cast are great.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I love playing mgt on xbox live been playing since stainlesd dropped the first mtg plwkrs and had been wishin forca mobile version up to par for android and stainless has done it!!! Awsome port... Wish there was a way it could recognize all my work on xbox version and mirror it on this app but its cool luv it so much willing to grind it out on this version... 100% worth the purchase
B00563K3DA|2.0|This is one book I could not finish, the dialogue seemed so un-natural that despite my desire to hear the message, I could not get thru it.
B00AEFYBGU|3.0|After watching more recent Adrian Lyne movies this one doesn't stand out! I wish this movie was more sophisticated and up-to-date!
B0092S4WLY|1.0|I read the reviews and thought that this  was a good game but truth is it isn't. the game CAN YOU ESCAPE is wwwwaaaaayyyyyyy better. don't waste your time.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game wasn't just one h.o. scene after another like some of these products. It was a good mix of story, visual, and logic puzzles. One little flaw in these games is the amount of back tracking and revisiting rooms begins to become a bit tedious. But all in all a fun and creepy romp under the sea.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is really fun!!! I couldn't put it down. the higher you go in the levels. the more difficult. I cant wait for more levels!!!!
B00CF34B2I|4.0|Really enjoy this app. It really helps teach you how to play and helps me stay in practice. I love the choice of playing with other people or just the campaign. I would highly recommend this to anyone wanting to learn how to play out people who like to play. It's worth the $10 it costs too
B004GJ1XU2|5.0|I would recommend this movie and I watch at least twice a year. It's always good to see good actors, like Glenn Close and Kevin Kline
1401322786|3.0|This is not a book you would expect from Mitch Albom, but it carries a strong message indeed. Dor is the man who created time and he is cursed to learn a lesson and teach two others a valuable lesson as well. If you think about it, no other animal pays close attention to time as humans. We have as many sayings about time as there are minutes in a day. Time is on our side... there's no time like the present... turn back the hands of time... Both Victor and Sarah have to deal with their own immortality and Dor allows them a glimpse into their futures. The moral of the story is that God gave us limited time on earth so that we value our days and understand that each one is very precious.
B008US4PBY|5.0|but this thing works wonders to give a ps3 life by letting me play with my 360 controller. I did have to turn to Google to figure out how to use... Too bad a crappy company owns such a great device. This company will not answer any calls, emails or texts. if you look at their Facebook you will see more hate from customers than any company ever.<br /><br />If you buy this and can't figure it out on your own, just know you are on your own.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoyed this game. its easy yet challenging. sucks its only 10 levels. be nice if it was more. good way to waste some time.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This is an interestig movie that is definately an original. It will hold your attention. Very well written and acted. Special effects are pretty good. Give it a try.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I think this is a fun game and my kids like it too. I like to eat the people when they are not looking.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This book was read prior to seeing the movie. I hope the movie is as good as the book. Thanks!
B004LZFWJO|4.0|I enjoy this game, I also play Candy Swipe 2 and I do like the added ability to spell CANDY and make extra points.  I enjoy trying to beat my previous scores.
B00BNZN27E|5.0|I've used this headline before - in a review of Otto Klemperer: [[ASIN:B008YKRRIQ Otto Klemperer: Romantic Symphonies]]<br />It applies to both men, but even more so to Bruno Walter, who was nine years older than Klemperer.<br /><br />Bruno Walter began his conducting career in 1894.<br />Johannes Brahms and Anton Bruckner were (just barely) contemporaries. Bruckner died in 1896, Brahms in 1897.<br />Gustav Mahler was very much a contemporary.<br />He hired Bruno Walter as an assistant in 1894, and Walter was part of Mahler's inner circle until the composer's death in 1911.<br />[Klemperer was part of the inner circle from 1905-1911].<br /><br />Bruno Walter was a Nineteenth Century musician who survived into the Modern Age.<br />A true dinosaur.<br />Thanks to the forward thinking of Columbia Records, the 82 year-old conductor was brought out of retirement in 1958 to record his core repertoire in modern stereo sound.<br />This continued until his death in 1962.<br /><br />I first started listening to classical music when I was fifteen - in 1964.<br />My first big crush was Herbert von Karajan.<br />I think I may have been influenced by the sheer look and feel of 1960s Deutsche Gramophon LP records.<br />They were twice as thick as American records, came in extra-wide plastic-lined sleeves, and didn't snap, crackle and pop like American records.<br /><br />The infatuation with Karajan lasted about five years, until I discovered Bruno Walter and Otto Klemperer at my college record shop (what's a record shop?).<br />The American pressings were still pretty awful, but the music-making was revelatory: Walter was warm and comforting; Klemperer was imposing and majestic.<br />Still my two favorite conductors of the stereo era.<br /><br />Young Bruno Walter could be tough. &#34;Old&#34; Bruno Walter was warm and fuzzy. Musicians loved him.<br />I loved him.<br />Dynamic conductors are a dime a dozen. Old Bruno Walter was something special.<br /><br />Bruno Walter seated his second violins stage right.<br />This was the custom in the Nineteenth Century.<br />Composers took it as a given.<br />You hear a lot of contrapuntal stuff which is absent when all violins are massed together on the left<br />(Karajan, Bernstein, Solti, and nearly every other modern conductor). *<br /><br />[hint: for ease of navigation, read the review though to the end, then come back and click on the links.]<br /><br />Walter's early European career is documented in an 8 CD box from EMI: [[ASIN:B006MO0O0Y Icon: The Early Recordings]]<br />His middle career (1941-1956) was based in New York.<br />The New York Philharmonic mono recordings were done by Columbia Records.<br />Many of them are in this box.<br />Aside from a few New York PO stereo sessions, the late stereo recordings were done in Los Angeles with the &#34;Columbia Symphony&#34;.<br />The &#34;Columbia Symphony&#34; was the Los Angeles Philharmonic under another name (the pre-1958 Columbia Symphony was mostly the New York Philharmonic).<br /><br />This new Bruno Walter Edition is a straight re-issue of Sony's mid-1990s Bruno Walter Edition.<br /><br />SOUND QUALITY:<br />No recordings were newly re-mastered for this box:<br />&#34;These recordings were mastered using 20-bit technology for &#34;high definition sound&#34;.<br />This was state of the art in 1995. An improvement over 16-bit.<br />They sound fine to me.<br /><br />A few of them were reissued after 2000, using &#34;Sony's Direct Stream Digital (DSD) System and SBM Direct&#34;.<br />I own the 2004 &#34;Masterworks Expanded Edition&#34; of Bruckner's Symphony 9.<br />I did an A/B comparison with the 1996 Bruckner 9 included in the Bruno Walter Edition.<br />The 2004 CD remastering sounded a tiny bit more impressive, but it was also transferred at a higher level which could affect my judgement.<br />One thing I noticed is that the timings are absolutely identical, which implies that Sony tweaked the 1996 digital master in 2004, instead of starting from scratch with the 1959 analog master tape, which a true re-mastering would have involved.<br /><br />BAD NEWS:<br />The mid-1990s Bruno Walter Edition did not include all of Bruno Walter's stereo recordings.<br />His stereo Mozart Symphonies 35-41, Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, Masonic Funeral Music, 4 Overtures, and Beethoven's Violin Concerto with Francescatti were bypassed in favor of the mono New York recordings (Szigeti was soloist in the Beethoven).<br />I though this was a mistake at the time, and Sony has not corrected the problem.<br />It would have meant only three additional CDs.<br />These stereo recordings have been issued separately: [[ASIN:B0056K4VRM Bruno Walter Conducts Mozart]] - or - [ [[ASIN:B00000DSDC Mozart: The Last 6 Symphonies]] - plus - [[ASIN:B0000025PL Mozart: Eine kleine Nachtmusik + Overtures K 486 588 492 620 477 (CBS Great Performances)]] ] - and - [[ASIN:B0000027OR Violin Concerto]]<br /><br />It would have been nice if Sony had also included the mono New York Beethoven and Brahms Symphonies, and Mahler Symphony 1.<br />The performances are quite a bit more dynamic.<br />I still prefer the warm and fuzzy stereo versions, but it would have presented a more rounded picture of Walter's accomplishment.<br /><br />The packaging is kind of dumb.<br />A 12 by 12 inch box, just like LP records used to come in.<br />Very retro, but it doesn't fit on my CD shelf.<br /><br />No texts or translations for the vocal works.<br />Inevitable with these budget boxes. Sigh.<br /><br />GOOD NEWS:<br />All the rehearsal recordings are included: Beethoven Symphonies 4,5,7,9, Mahler Symphony 9, Mozart Symphony 36, Wagner Siegfried Idyll.**<br />Even his rehearsals were warm and fuzzy.<br />When I want to hear the Siegfried-Idyll, I actually prefer this rehearsal to anybody's performance of the complete work.<br /><br />A gorgeous booklet is included, with lots of well-produced photographs.<br />A new and excellent biography of Walter (slightly gossipy), plus detailed history of these recordings.<br /><br />The price is incredibly low.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />* Leopold Stokowski is credited with devising the modern seating plan with massed violins on the left.<br />Stokowski liked the richer string sound that resulted when the f-holes of both violin sections were facing the audience.<br />This is not as lewd as it sounds.<br />The f-holes are two f-shaped holes on the top of the violin.<br />They serve to focus and project the sound coming from the interior of the instrument.<br />Violinists seated to the left of the conductor hold their instruments at a 45 degree angle toward the audience.<br />Those to the right hold their instruments at a 45 degree angle away from the audience (unless they're left-handed, then no problem).<br />Sacrificing clarity for fullness of tone: the &#34;Philadelphia Sound.&#34;<br /><br />This new system also made it easier for musicians to stay together, and Twentieth century conductors came increasingly to adopt it<br />(bot not Toscanini or Furtwangler, both of whom passed away before stereo could document their divided violins).<br />Contemporaries of Walter who remained loyal to divided violins in the stereo age included Klemperer, Monteux, Boult, Bohm and Kubelik.<br />[Fritz Reiner's earliest Chicago Symphony stereo recordings had divided violins, but by 1957 he had given up and adopted massed violins on the left].<br /><br />** A few very hard-to-find rehearsals were omitted. Thanks to pclaudel for this information:<br /><br />&#34; Apropos your comment on rehearsals, are you aware that there are several rehearsals that have never appeared on CD? The most important is the entire second movement of the Beethoven 5th, from the same group of sessions in LA whence the first movement rehearsal emerged. I have it on LP, as does everyone else that bought the first thousand or so copies of the repackaged single LP containing the 5th and the Schubert Unfinished on the flip side (MS 6506). (Note that even Erik Ryding and the two colleagues of his who prepared the fabulous online BW discography make no mention of the second movement rehearsal.)<br /><br />There was also a ten-inch LP containing a 16-minute rehearsal of parts of the first movement of the Brahms 2nd and another 3+ minutes of the first movement of the Brahms 3rd, both taped in December 1953 at the time the NY Philharmonic recordings of these works were made. The catalog number was LP 32785, with the label marked &#34;NOT FOR SALE&#34; (it was evidently produced as some sort of a promotional premium). Sony may not even know this material exists, although Ryding et al. do indeed include it in their discography!<br /><br />I got the Brahms disc at auction on the well-known Bay site right around the start of the present century. It must have been a slow week there, because I was the only bidder (I paid about ten dollars, perhaps less) and the seller openly voiced his surprise and disappointment at the lack of response. I can hardly blame him, since the only other time I saw this LP turn up on the Bay, it went for over a hundred! &#34;, plus detailed history of these recordings.<br /><br />The price is incredibly low.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />* Leopold Stokowski is credited with devising the modern seating plan with massed violins on the left.<br />Stokowski liked the richer string sound that resulted when the f-holes of both violin sections were facing the audience.<br />This is not as lewd as it sounds.<br />The f-holes are two f-shaped holes on the top of the violin.<br />They serve to focus and project the sound coming from the interior of the instrument.<br />Violinists seated to the left of the conductor hold their instruments at a 45 degree angle toward the audience.<br />Those to the right hold their instruments at a 45 degree angle away from the audience (unless they're left-handed, then no problem).<br />Sacrificing clarity for fullness of tone: the &#34;Philadelphia Sound.&#34;<br /><br />This new system also made it easier for musicians to stay together, and Twentieth century conductors came increasingly to adopt it<br />(bot not Toscanini or Furtwangler, both of whom passed away before stereo could document their divided violins).<br />Contemporaries of Walter who remained loyal to divided violins in the stereo age included Klemperer, Monteux, Boult, Bohm and Kubelik.<br />[Fritz Reiner's earliest Chicago Symphony stereo recordings had divided violins, but by 1957 he had given up and adopted massed violins on the left].<br /><br />** A few very hard-to-find rehearsals were omitted.

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Best two dollar game on kindle. I used very few hints to extend the game. Now I just want more!
B000065V42|5.0|How old is this movie?  I don't really want to know... but my elementary level kids absolutely loved it and we've watched it more than once.  Pure family entertainment.  It's a wonderful classic that entertains and makes you laugh.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This order arrived on time in a nice package.This is a great bag for a carrie on, It holds Nikon D300, four lens, one flash and a few other things. Its nice and feels good on the back.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Easy to apply, works great, gives heat sink maximum contact &amp; lowered temp in extreme gaming 5-7C.  Just order &amp; keep on hand.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|It was okay, but I am glad I didn't pay to see this one in the theaters. Maybe I would have enjoyed it more if I was a kid.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Phenomenal writer.I marvel at his ability to not only describe the various sciences  and to develop each character as he unravels each plot in the development of his story.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|Yes, it is another vampire romance book, but I will admit it was a fun summer read and that I plan to read the second book.
B005G5PPGS|5.0|This is a really well written book.  I had heard about Moneyball in the media when it first came out.  It was good to finally read it and understand what it was all about.
1781162646|3.0|I have a lot of ridiculous habits. I'll spare you details (and me the onslaught of shame) by keeping most of them to myself, but there is one in particular I think would serve this review well, so I'm going to share it with you.<br /><br />Because I read so many books in such a short amount of time, I have to quick-fire decompress between them.  I obviously don't have the luxury of waiting a week (gorging out on reality TV and cold pizza - as depressing as THAT sounds) to start a new book, so I have to find an easy, quick (and effective) way to zip up the previous book, and move on.<br /><br />Most of you might think this is easy. And for some...it might actually be. But I (as most of you probably know by now) tend to get emotionally attached to books. I disappear into their world, and (more often than not) find it hard to find my way back out. I used to try TV. Watch a show here, a crappy informercial there...and tada. All's well that ends well. But, like most things...that became old (and incredibly ineffective) very quickly.<br /><br />So one night (and by night I mean 3am) I picked up my little black book of quotes and began reading. Honestly, I didn't think this would work. It was after-all a book fill with quotes from other books. How in the world would this ever help me? But the more I read the more I relaxed. Instead of focusing on one book, it reinforced my love of reading ALL books. And, if I read ANOTHER novel...maybe, just maybe, I could find another awesome quote for my book.<br /><br />The first time I did this I read 27 pages of my scribbly handwriting before stopping. The second, third and fourth times didn't fair much better, but I did realize (after the fourth time....don't judge me, I'm a slow learner) that I always flipped to the same page (to read one specific quote) before putting it down.<br /><br /> \\"there's no harm in hoping for the best as long as you're prepared for the worst.\\"<br /><br />Now, ironic as this may be (considering what I'm currently reviewing) this is a Stephen King quote (from his novella collection \\"Different Seasons.\\") and it is the first time I have EVER had to go back (while in the middle of a story) and read it again.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />Well...because this is Stephen King, and I ALWAYS expect the best...it's just that THIS TIME, I didn't prepare for the worst.<br /><br />\\"Set in a small-town North Carolina amusement park in 1973, Joyland tells the story of the summer in which college student Devin Jones comes to work as a carny and confronts the legacy of a vicious murder, the fate of a dying child, and the ways both will change his life forever.\\"<br /><br />To be fair, this is not the worst book I have read. Hell, it's not even the worst King book I have ever read. But it also...wasn't what I wanted or expected.<br /><br />To sum things up, \\"Joyland\\" is 85% coming of age, 15% hard crime. Most of the time I wouldn't have a problem with this (hey, I was young once...I can relate.) but this time it just rubbed me the wrong way.<br /><br />For those of you that have never read a \\"Hard Case Crime\\" novel let me explain what it is. Hard Case Crime (in their words) brings you the \\"best in hardboiled crime fiction, ranging from lost noir masterpieces to new novels by today's most powerful writers, featuring stunning original cover art in the grand pulp style.\\"<br /><br />In short...novels whose plot revolve around wit, violence and the ability stage cheap thrills.<br /><br />\\"Joyland\\" had all of the above. Unfortunately, it was overshadowed by Devin's need to pine over a (less than intriguing) ex girlfriend, or his need to learn the local \\"carne\\" lingo. (For the record...I got tired of the \\"language\\" about 5 pages after it was introduced.) In the grand \\"coming of age\\" scheme of things, his inability to except reality and move the hell on was entirely appropriate. The problem arose when it dominated the bulk of the story line leaving very little room for the actual \\"crime.\\" Each time the \\"ghost/murder\\" was mentioned it was quickly swept under the rug and replaced with a four page monologue on how to fly a kite, or the best words to use when playing Scrabble.<br /><br />I enjoyed the characters. They were very well developed, and equally as interesting. I just wish they could have seen more action. I wanted mystery (not predictability.) I wanted pulp, noir, blood in the backseat of an old beat up truck. NOT crime \\"lite\\" if you will.<br /><br />And speaking of the crime (which finally found it's focus at 90%!) it was just a little too tidy for my taste. For a ghost that has been haunting an amusement park ride for so darn long, you'd think it'd take more than a little wave and a wink (not literally) for it to move on.<br /><br />I will say that when the action DID hit, it hit hard. But by that point I had all but given up on that aspect of the story. Chocking it up to what it was instead of what it was supposed to be.<br /><br />I know what you are thinking...\\"Misty, if it was so bad, why did you give it 3 stars?\\" Well, there is a fairly easy explanation for that. Devin's story was an interesting one. It was introspective, and ultimately sweet. If I hadn't been tainted with hard crime expectations I probably would have enjoyed this book more than I actually did. But as it is...it was just ok. Slow in places and too quick in others.<br /><br />In the end, I think if you are looking for hard crime, you need to look else where. BUT if you enjoy the cadence and complexity of King's writing, without the expectation of violence (like I was) then chances are you will enjoy it. It all boils down to understanding. Understanding what the book is about. Understanding your preferences, and understanding your expectations. If you have all of those under control...then I think you are educated enough to make a wise decision.<br /><br />Happy Reading my fellow Kindle-ites and remember: \\"Come to the book as you would come to an unexplored land.

B0097GVJWQ|5.0|The game is great! I don't think I would ever get tired of playing games as good as the ghost of maple creek. The game is well worth the money.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|We received the Downton Abbey Season 3 DVD set quickly and have watched every episode of the set. We are Downton Abbey fans now and look forward to the new season coming up in January 2014.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I had it on my old pc, so instead of replacing it on my new laptop I have it on my kindle, that way I can take it anywhere.
B00CE03UOC|4.0|If you like Flow Free, then this is very similar with neon colors. Just passed the first set and so far it is fun.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|Now I can use the power from my coworker's Thunderbolt display on my MacBook Pro after he's gone from work for the day.  I love it.
B004EPZ00C|1.0|Unfortunately I was obliged to give them one star or the system wouldn't work.  I would have loved to give them more, but as i was sent dvd's in the wrong format for the UK, and have returned them, i haven't seen the films, so although I've heard they are very good indeed, I cannot personally comment.
B00CL1SR7O|5.0|my daughter hasn't stopped listening since she got it. the product came on time and as described. recommend this cd.
B004UID2LC|1.0|So the first time I downloaded this like in January it worked completely fine, but since the latest update for some reason my music, photos, and videos sometimes wouldn't work and everything stopped responding and shut down....I had to repeatedly restart my kindle for it to start working again, then realized where it was coming from and was forced to uninstall this app....this thing has a virus I guess :/
B00CRS88IO|5.0|The Ian Fleming Files: Operation Armada' is a James Bond story with a twist: it happens to be about James Bond's creator, Ian Fleming. The setting is June 1940. With the collapse of France, Admiral John Godfrey at the Naval Intelligence Department dispatches Ian Fleming a.k.a. `17F' to meet with the head of the French Navy, the megalomaniacal Admiral Darlan (who suffers from the \\"Small Man Syndrome\\") in an attempt to negotiate the purchase of his battleships before Hitler can get his hands on them. Of course, nothing goes according to plan and the future author of `Casino Royale' (to name one of many) finds himself stranded in occupied territory with only one drop dead gorgeous French Resistance agent to help him. Needless to say, romance ensues but there's nothing predictable about the narrative: twists and turns abound and there are not one but two dastardly villains, Darlan and the vicious Wehrmacht officer, General Bock. Peppered into this World War II narrative are many 007 references, from the Miss Moneypenny-like Paddy Blythe and the `M'-like John Godfrey to the meals Fleming orders, the slick suits he wears, the beautiful women in his world and of course the overall notion of a sophisticated gentleman battling a madman to save the world. This is not a copy or an homage but its own fully realized story inside a unique, living, breathing universe. There are over a dozen unique and fascinating characters and the adventure Fleming goes on is original and compelling. There is a slight excess of action, as if the author was trying to cram as much in as possible, but it makes the pages turn fast and I found the ski chase and the heist on Bock's compound to be utterly thrilling, and loved the descriptions of all the hardware, weapons and battles. The ending was a real shock and was actually rather moving, tying up the emotional underpinning to the story. I recommend this book for anyone interested in the origins of James Bond, World War II or just a solid, entertaining thriller. I could easily see this book become a movie of its own!
B0001I562I|5.0|Its always fun to share the movies with them.  It's interesting to watch and listen to their comments during and after the movies. Thanks for the intertainment!
1781162646|5.0|This is more of the &#34;modern&#34; King who tells great stories without as much gore or horror. Good to see a master take on another genre of book. Perfect summer read, whether you're a King fan or not.
B0053FANS6|5.0|Its always fun to share the movies with them.  It's interesting to watch and listen to their comments during and after the movies. Thanks for the intertainment!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I ordered the set for my son to watch after he read each book.  It was in great shape, and at a great price!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Lots of fun when you have some spare time. Enjoy solving puzzles and some are a little tricky. I think the first few levels should be a little harder though.
B00C061I3K|5.0|This is the album that can mellow me out after a long day, or keep me going through a busy one.
1623420148|5.0|I loved this book!! It was quite refreshing to be in the guys POV, and he was talking directly to the reader!! Fantastic!!
B0030IIYWA|5.0|This one is a classic.  We like having the Blu-ray / DVD combo to be able to use the Blu-ray at home and take the DVD with us on trips.
1592332803|5.0|I love this book!  I have been a baker for years, and after choosing to follow a vegan lifestyle last year, I wanted to incorporate more compassion into my baking without sacrificing flavor.  I found Colleen Patrick-Goudreau through her podcast, Vegetarian Food for Thought.  I also explored her website and decided to buy this book based on some recipes after trying her 30 Day Vegan Challenge.  I'm so glad I did!  I love referencing this book when I bake, and have found it useful in converting my own recipes to be vegan.  The book is well written, easy to follow, and has some delicious recipes that everyone can enjoy (both vegans and non-vegans alike).
B0036TGT3E|5.0|This one is a classic.  We like having the Blu-ray / DVD combo to be able to use the Blu-ray at home and take the DVD with us on trips.
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|Excellent writing and acting. Totally hilarious. Just the part with Melissa McCarthy is worth it by itself. I highly recommend this comedy
B004G6009U|5.0|The kids love this one.  We like having the Blu-ray / DVD combo to be able to use the Blu-ray at home and take the DVD with us on trips.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|This app is the worst hair salon game ever. It's so cheap. They try to copy Toca Boca's Hair Salon #2. (which is so much better.) I don't know why some people enojoy these cheap apps. The graphics are horrible. It's a waste of space.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|We love the Toy Story movies.  We like having the Blu-ray / DVD combo to be able to use the Blu-ray at home and take the DVD with us on trips.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It's frustratingly awesome! I have a hard time putting it down. I love the different rooms and the puzzles are great!
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|I really liked this book, I read it in about 3 days while on vacation. It's an easy read, even the &#34;hard&#34; parts were difficult to read, but Jaycee discussed it and moved on. Very good book.
B001LPWGE6|5.0|Absolutely love all of the movies and my boyfriend was very pleased with it as his Christmas present! We also like the box that the DVDs come in.
B003THJA1G|5.0|It was great to see the very first episode. I look forward to seeing the rest. My service from Amazon.com - even with forbearance, since I by mistake first ordered a download of episodes. This was forgiven and credited back to me and then  - more joy -my wanted order of a DVD of the first Castle series came in 2 days -arriving July 1, when I did not expect it to arrive before the 4th of July.A very pleasant experience in these recession days.
B009LDXQGW|5.0|Bought this for my boyfriend.  He is very Happy with the trilogy and is enjoying it! It is a great price for 3 Cd's.
B008EKON56|5.0|This will be short and sweet.  You have NOT HEARD YOUR IPOD until you have listened through the line out jack instead of through the mini plug jack.  The sound is so much richer with a wonderfully impactfull bass response.  Don't debate this with yourself.  Buy it and really listen to your music.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|It takes a while to get into this, but before you know it,you are hooked. The orphanages of that period were accurately described, and the plight of those poor children was awful. This story has layers of character development and is worth exploring. By the time I got to the end I was glad I persevered. I was left with a profound desire to find a child to rescue, to love and nurture, to prove that our world is not uncaring , and that every child has the right to be loved.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I love all the Percy Jackson books and I only have three more to read. Don't listen to all the bad reviews, I'm nine and I can handle all the death's and monsters. But just in case I would recommend this book 8 and up. But I wouldn't think a six or seven year old would enjoy reading this.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|I hate this game not everything is unlock you would have to buy it or get one of a game from this company that made the game! I would recommend to a toca Boca hair salon instead of this one does cost money but it's better!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this was very fun and a bit of a challenge.  I can not wait until they create new rooms because I like these types of logic puzzles.
B008UX2UIO|4.0|open the first page and read, you won't stop till you hit a reasonable stop which is half way in
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like this game because  I can't seem to put it down until I have figured out the key to get out. Some are very challenging, but makes you think that much harder on trying to escape.
B00BHNQ5XK|3.0|Good acting and a reasonable story. Why the lead male character, the writer played by Ethan Hawke , would put his family in harm's way by moving into a house where people were murdered and always keeps the lights down so low that it gives the creepy little critters such a big advantage never made any sense.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Cool game but have to waste money on the investment points in my opinion there should an update and take that away
B004JN1CW4|5.0|I really liked this series. It was a new twist in an apocalyptic style writing. The characters were great and the author did a great job keeping the story going with just enough excitement. I highly recommend this series.
B00AZMFO6I|3.0|Quartet is a story about life that will appeal mainly to older people and artists. As an artist I can relate to most of what was portrayed here. The acting is top notch. I think the reason why I didn't rate it higher is because it doesn't ring true. The story focuses on a group of talented, vibrant seniors living in a very nice home for the elderly. Why aren't they with their families or living independently from the wealth they created as famous people? The themes are relatable. The story is really not. The reality of it would probably be that you wouldn't have so many in a home, the home would be a dump, and they'd be more debilitated. Of course, that doesn't make such a great story either though. ;) I think if I were in a different frame of mind or maybe just older, I'd enjoy it more.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is awesome.<br />Everybody loves the minions.<br /><br />Great fun (and much better than other similar games).<br />It is highly recommended.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This novel is not what it seems, you just start to form an opinion and, another twist takes it somewhere else--a great read!
B000FC1MM8|5.0|As usual Connelly is entertaining as ever and keeps interest throughout. Another  highly recommended read in a series of good reading.
B00CHRB9RM|2.0|This work just emphasizes what a loss duane was to the band, if the live fillmore record was a 9.5 this is a 3.5. the packaging is the most impressive I've seen but what a waste of four discs. the song titles are all top notch but the versions are mediocre at best. I've heard numerous bootlegs of these titles that are better recordings. highlights- most of the drums in these songs sound fabulous as usual with these two seasoned pros, midnight rider sounds really fresh and crisp. lowlights blue sky is the worst version ever like half the band is sleeping, horrid versions of eliz. reed and Jessica. an eve with the Allmans at the beacon #1 blows this set away i'm just sadly surprised that after 40 years of material this is what they came up with, very disappointed!! t.r.
1608955702|4.0|This book really helped solve a lot of the questions I had around camera and flash working together. It illustrates great insights into exactly what the title says ... Direction and Quality of Light. Neil's a great teacher and has a firm grasp on many principles as well as the eloquence to relate them to the reader. Good read.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Terrific movie with all the elements that I like as mentioned above. I like scifi and I like good stories! Terrific entertainment!
B0035G0U2O|1.0|WORST MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />WOULD RATE IT 0 STARS IF I COULD...WISH I HAD NEVER WASTED MY TIME WATCHING THIS MOVIE,DO NOT SPEND YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS HORRIBLE FILM!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it. It is good for kids, also addicting for adults. It is easier then temple run. I love being able to compete people on Facebook.
B004AKCME8|4.0|This was a gift, so I did not see the movie, but I was told it was enjoyed very much.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like this game<br />the way how everything is so realistic and entering into competitions to go against other horses
B005COO1X6|5.0|Story captures you and impossible to put down. Well worth the money and time to read. Do not miss this one.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This was truly a great book.Well worth the time it took to read it . The character development was excellent . The interaction between characters was also very well designed.
0140449337|4.0|The book arrived landed at my doorstep in excellent condition. Now time to sit back and enjoy flicking through its pages :)
B000W453KQ|5.0|I'm a young women and I will tell nothing compare to this movie. I love this movie so much no words could describe the way this movie makes me feels.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|Loved this movie!  This was an excellent study in characters, and the actors who played them did a fantastic job.
B004W1GCQO|5.0|I loved this series. I'm only to sorry they canceled it so that they're is only two seasons. But I totally recommend it. Especially if you love Downton Abbey.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The puzzles in the rooms are challenging and keep you into the game, wanting you to get to the next room.
0345535421|5.0|I first started to watch the series on HBO and continued to read the second book and watch alongside it. I had my doubts about this the first episode in season one, but I'm addicted.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|I really enjoyed it however However, I am glad I didn't spend the money to see it in the theater.
0756405890|3.0|This book is a wonderful tale about a man telling a tale. Got that? The main protagonist, who's name can only be pronounced with early onset lung cancer coughing, is awesome. Super awesome. The best thing to ever happen. He is boss. He invented the internet, air, Nike, the common cold and love. He is made from real tiger blood and everything he does he is WINNING. It gets annoying. We get it dude, you are the real deal. The story surrounding him is fantastic if he had just a wee bit more humility. The basic gist is everything the boy does he immediately becomes better than any of his peers resulting in a situation where he demonstrates his fantasticalness. If the book would dial it back a bit this could have been one of the best books, but alas it falls short.
0770437400|5.0|#1: It's not really a book about zombies, it's a book about society and how people respond in crisis.<br /><br />#2: It's a badass book about badass people doing badass things.<br /><br />#3: Max Brooks takes you on a journey, he gives you an experience. And his most generous act-he's invisible. He only writes what the character would say, not what he wants to say.<br /><br />#4: So much fact and history is woven into this book it's hard to tell where fact ends and fiction begins. You'll probably start to embarrass yourself in conversations by giving bits of history and fact that are from WWZ, not an actual war.<br /><br />#5: \\"Fiction is the lie through which we tell the truth.\\" -Albert Camus - A lot of truth about our species is told in this book.<br /><br />#6: Scenes in this will make you proud to be human.<br /><br />#7: Scenes in this will make you ashamed to be human.<br /><br />#8: It has a Japanese ninja warrior zombie slayer. A blind Japanese ninja warrior zombie slayer.<br /><br />#9: It holds a mirror in front of you. It makes you ask important questions such as:<br /><br />-who am I without my family?<br /><br />-who am I without my job?<br /><br />-who am I without my society?<br /><br />-what offering do I bring in a crisis?<br /><br />In Arthur Sinclair Junior's chapter, he says, \\"We needed carpenters, masons, machinist, gunsmiths.

This book shows the before/during/after effects of our world in crisis. How prepared are you?
B0094K1WZE|4.0|Well, it's Mission: Impossible. Of course there is plenty of action. Sometimes Cruises character seemed to be having a Nathan Drake (Uncharted) day, which brought the humor to the movie. I was able to watch this from the Amazon Prime app on the Panasonic LCD i bought at Christmas using Samsung active 3D glasses which made it much more entertaining. It turned out to be an Amazon-provided afternoon since all parts but the cable connection came from Amazon. Thanks, guys!
B00BPWDMP2|4.0|My first Lady Antebellum album; and it is great. Good choice of music and terrific sound.  Lady Antebellum rocks it
B0091REZMW|5.0|I just started playing it have not gotten too far. I like what ive seen so far. its interesting game.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's the best game I have on my kindle!! It so much fun! I recommend it to anyone who loves addicting games! Survival mode is the best. But I also have a mansion on creative. It's just too easy on creative
B005LAIH2C|5.0|I bought this for our DVD/Blue Ray collection.  I always look for interesting movies, or movies that my wife likes.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I happened to just watch &#34;Nemo&#34; last week and had forgotten how cute the movie was.  As an adult, that's a hard thing to admit, but so be it.  When I ran across this game on my Kindle, I just had to see it.  It is addictive and fun.  And yes, periodically you will learn something about the ocean from Nemo, his dad, or one of his friends.  It's a cute was to pass some time.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|I can't believe I JUST started watching this show. Great characters, entertaining plots, and plenty of science!!! Couldn't ask for anything better.
B0015AARJI|3.0|It's a pleasantly designed and functional device, but in my 33-year-old man hands it feels like a toy for children, little people, and ladies or gentlemen with shorter fingers.  I just don't like how the analog sticks are so close together that my thumbs brush against and tickle each other while I'm trying to operate movement and camera controls in a game -- it's a feeling that annoys me and takes me out of the experience.  So it's an aesthetically pleasing thing that isn't nearly as functionally/physically pleasing to me as the Xbox 360 controller.  On that note I resent having to spend any money on replacing these things should my controller break.  If that happens I'll most likely be looking into 3rd-party options.  Here's hoping the PS4's controller feels a whole lot better in my hands.
B008YI91HS|2.0|We won't be watching this movie any longer due to the bad words and a few other parts that were just not necessary for the movie to be a complete success.  The foul language was not necessary.  It is very intense and filled with action.<br />Could have been excellent.
030758836X|4.0|This is a well written book with interesting characters that you love and hate. It's not your typical crime novel.  Good summer reading!
B00470TOV0|5.0|A classic, introduced my son to it for the first time, he loved it to.  We need more movies like this!
B00004Y6NX|5.0|I got this one because I had heard this version of &#34;Romeo and Juliet&#34; on &#34;Pandora&#34;.........Dire Straits at their best in my opinion. I would highly recommend this one for your collection.

If you're in the mood for some &#34;take a break from it all and chill out&#34; kind of music???......then I recommend you get this one.
B00466HN6S|5.0|Ok, so I love cartoon movies. Very cute, and a nice story line. Perfect for all ages of children, even for some of us adults that like to watch these all American, g rated movies.
B007SOQBCM|5.0|Love Twitch. I have no complaints of their services at all. Well maybe one, they sure reduced the amount of free time to sit around and contemplate deeper things like whether the cake really is a lie or perhaps the mere thought of it brought it into a form existence . Now I'm lost in the world of twitch streaming. I guess it's well worth it. Almost as addictive as the games themselves.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|This game is a little hard to play. It kinda gets my finger movements but not really. This game is fun but horrible. Sometimes it puts me in a bad mood. But I still play it and sometimes it's great.
B00AE4OGCU|5.0|I saw the movie on tv and thought I would read the following two books. I enjoyed the books much more than the movie so I went back and read the first book when I finished the other two.<br /><br />Quite a &#34;hard&#34; story and not really what I would normally choose but I thought the books were well written. You felt drawn in to the story and its twists and turns. I felt quite angry at the injustice of the story and gratified by the outcome.<br /><br />Thoroughly recommended.
B0031R5K68|5.0|This is Dan Brown as I know it. Thrilling, keeps you excited all the way through and I simply cannot put the book down. No change in the style, nothing really really new. It's like reading Angels and Daemons or Da Vinci Code for the first time again.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Wow! I learned so much about myself! I have a much better understanding of my childhood and I understand why I felt so loved by my mom and why I didn't 'feel' as loved by my dad. My son felt very loved by me because his love languages are very similar to mine. This book helped me to understand my relationships with others much, much better as well. A must have book!
B000BTC5LW|5.0|What can i write about the best band in History !!!<br />Just listen and enjoy what it will do to you !<br />Never seen nothing like this before !!!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|These books are fantastic. Book 2 is as good as 1 so far, maybe better because we already know all of the characters so well and have a history with them.<br /><br />The quality of this e-book is great. Also, I wasn't sure if it would have the maps and family descriptions that the hard-copies do, but it does, so worry not that you might miss out on having those if you go with the e-book.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|I really just love Sam. I love Grace and Sam's relationship. It's adorable! I didn't like Isabella at first but towards the end of the book she grew on me. Such a good book.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Super fun! Excellent for testing your memory. Passes my time wonderfully. In my opinion, much better than 100 floors. You use whole rooms with this app. I highly reccomend it!
B0070ZLZ1G|4.0|Tough shares the research and work that has been happening in education and what children need to succeed. And it's not gadgets.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|I really enjoyed all the other flow games, so I was very disappointed when I finished them. But now that I have flow free, I can have hours of enjoyment with this these all new puzzles.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Best I have seen on TV.  Something everyone would enjoy.  will be watching it and enjoying it for years over and over again.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Recommended to me by a friend to whom I will be forever grateful.  Few books have touched me as this one has.  I'm sure my next dog will be named Enzo.
B007T99ENE|5.0|Tight plotting, great twist in the end brought the story full circle. Very evocative of the period. Loved the MI5 detail.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I read this because I had read the other two.  As an adult I found it boring, but I can see why a teen would enjoy it. Quite simplistic in writing style.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|Funny, action packed and entertaining, probably not to go the movies but yes definitively recommended to watch it at home!!!!
B00AEFY66U|5.0|I like this the best.  Saw the new one but thought the special effects just distracted from the story.  The book is beautifully written; great characters.  This movie does more subtle justice to the novel.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|This book was a little flat.  Not much intrigue.  Guess I'll have to wait for the next episode and hope that it's more riveting.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|A CD you can put in a enjoy every song. Only problem is that some of the songs are mislabled but that's easy to do just edit.
B00CW6DAKC|4.0|Used to play this on fb so happy to have it on kindle now. Seems like it is good, but just started playing game so we shall see.
B0041OT9W6|5.0|Ever since I read this book it has been one of my favorites.  Definitely worth it.  I love this book!!! A must read!
B001EBYMB2|4.0|This film has a similar format as 2001 and that fact helps illuminate the problem with this and why 2001 worked so much better.<br />There's little emotional connection with the stars of this. All the acting is good, the plot somewhat lacking, but entertaining, but you sit back and watch this as though through a window. The viewer is never drawn in. In 2001 that worked to the benefit of the plot: computers, people in spaceships millions of miles in outer space. We were watching waiting to see what would happen. This film was the Viet Nam war, we know what happened and need that connection. But it's not fully developed.
B0045HCJGC|5.0|I have watched this movie dozens of times. Love the story and all the action. The humor really breaks up the tension. So listening to the director I found out that Wesley Snipes ad-libbed a lot of the scenes and dialog. He is a karate black belt so he did his own fights. Stallone wanted to do his own fights too. Sandra Bullock was brought in to add a softer, human face to the future that was very cut politically correct and sterile. A different set of actors were originally scheduled for the leads but I won’t tell you what changed that.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|Cool special effects, great actors. The action and CG effects were clearly where the money went. The story itself was a little two-dimensional and flat, culminating in Hollywood's current favorite moral message: if you dont like the rules, get them changed so you can do whatever you want.
B00AO2P3GA|2.0|the update dosent work. it is not possible to have a enoughf space for it can someone help me please thanks help<br />please pleaseeeee
B00957T6X6|3.0|The books themselves are great but putting all five into one eBook is a dumb idea. I had thought I was going to get 5 separate books. By jamming them all into one it makes it very difficult to move between one book and another.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I couldn't put this read down. Really looking forward to seeing the movie and reading the third book in the series.
B001SZ8Y72|5.0|Humorous parody of the way corporations work(although it is sad because such things are true). Tim Robbins was perfect for the lead.
B006DJ2JSI|1.0|it freezes my kindle then it made me restart my kindle! It was stupid cause it makes my kindle die on full battery! It sucks.
B000UX6THK|5.0|but does anyone know when (or if) the Blu-Ray version of this is coming out? I don't want to spend $60 on this only to have a Blu-ray version of it come out less than a year later...
B00CGPPMKU|4.0|because of how this \\"drawing\\" app works, I would describe it more of a doodling app. the way each brush works, even drawing a simple line expands it out beyond what you draw with your finger/stylus. there are two modes of drawing included with this app: 1)touch-where the line you draw will stop from beginning to end, but still expands slightly on the sides, and 2) continuous-where what you draw will continue to flow out from all sides. you have the option to change the percentage of how far the expansion is depending on the type of line you are drawing (zig-zag, straight, or rainbow shape).  there are several different \\"brushes\\" you can choose from, but since they are all basically the same with the exception of color it doesn't make sense to call it a change of the \\"brush\\". the another option you are left with is the background color. there is an undo (seems to be unlimited as to the number of strokes you can undo), and an option to save or delete the entire picture (not found in the same spots). there is an option to upload photos, with the option to upload from a computer, facebook, or a phone. I do have photo's in my kindle fire hd device, but they show up as an option to use for this app (unless I missed something, if I did I'm sorry). I didn't try to upload anything as you have to enter e-mail/facebookID/phone number, so I'm not sure how well this option works or not.  the app description lists IAP's but I didn't see any of those, so this seems to be the full app (instead of a trial version that a previous reviewer stated). this isn't even close to \\"the best drawing app available\\" as one reviewer states (my choice is sketchmobile), but this would be a nice and simple doodle app for yourself or anyone with younger children who can't draw yet and enjoy making lines and swirls (or any age in between for that matter)
B00BY1F8UQ|5.0|I chose this CD because of the artistry of Keith Jarrett and cohesiveness and power of the group. Geat sound.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Loved first two novels, story lines built quickly. This third edition reveals much of the same scenario over and over again.
B007C94XG4|5.0|I wanted to watch this with my 2 grandsons. They are 3 and 6. Not only did they enjoy it so did I. We watched this movie on three different occasions. I remember The Chipmunks from when I was growing up and I'm so glad that I can share it with my best boys.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is an awesome game that helps your eye hand coordination while<br />letting you have fun! #2 has curves unlike #1 ,I hope you LOVE this app as much as I do.
B00005ONMP|5.0|Mendelsshon was never very satisfied with his own works,  I however feel that he was a genius and I love his music.<br /><br />This recording is well performed by the orchestras and is done with extremely good fidelity.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|this was a fantastic book. it drew me in and held my attention. i am looking forward to the second book.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This game is a lot of fun for kids. I would recommend this for any parent wanting a fun game for there kids.
1846573793|5.0|wish there was more, but enjoyed the story.  I think the sex could settle down a bit once she is expecting and a mother but guess that is all part of story of them.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I have been watching The Walking Dead from the very beginning and it gets better every season. I am the ultimate fan!!
B000FA5TTW|4.0|This book had me hooked from the very beginning. The only think I did not like was the cussing and sex at young ages. I would recommend this to teenagers my age 14 and above.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|A challenge for the mind and senses, these kind of games are definitely some of my favorites. Kudos to the brains and imagination behind the g5 games.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|I really enjoy a good mental challenge and Floors Escape really gets the muscle moving.  It starts out easy enough, like any workout, and moves up from there! I really do appreciate apps like this that are offered for free, and don't find a few well placed ads to be that annoying in return. Very challenging, but doable app. I have seen other people that complain about no &#34;hint&#34; button, so if your not up for that kind of challenge, you could just take the stairs I guess :)
0064431789|5.0|This is a heartwarming classic story for boys and girls of adventurous spirit and their parents. It is very imaginative and well written and illustrated.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|I haven't read a book like this ever. Twisting, turning, frightening , it's hard to find words.<br />Read it. Now
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book was a huge eye opener for me. It explained so many health issues which are effecting me. I highly recommend this book to anyone suffering from IBS, diabetes, and other related diseases.<br />I am going wheat free!
B00884GR0W|5.0|this game is awesome just get it. its not minecraft though so don't get your hopes up for a copy of minecraft-pocket edition. block story is a sortof story based game with cool old fasiond rpg aspects. buy it
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Charges our cell phones faster than other chargers, and has the added bonus of being compact. I like that it's universal.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This book was the best in the series so far and I can hardly wait for the next installation. Sylvia is an amazing writer she pulls you into the lives of the characters and keeps you in thralled through out the book. The CrossFire Series can be compared somewhat to the 50 Shades trilogy but there is so much more than just sex in these books. I would recommend them to anyone who enjoyed 50 Shades as I did, they will not disappoint.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I seriously don't understand what all the hype is about. I found the book laborious to read, and a chore to get 'into'.  Unfortunately it confirms what men already know about women, that they will do anything to have a husband who is rich and powerful. Yawn.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|I don't like the fact that you need to be near an WiFi connection in order to play it. I got it for my grandson to play while traveling and this is not possible
0393317552|4.0|The way he described the history of our civilizations is interesting, amusing and very coherent.<br />However, the explanation of the particular development of China didn't quite convinced me.<br />Even more, the extrapolation of at the very end into a kind of capitalist evolution of corporations is definitely too far away the deductive process taken the premises explored throughout the body of the book.
B00821OX98|5.0|I hope it can make it to a logical conclusion. Nothing worse than getting invested in a show and then &#34;poof&#34; cancellation.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Great game. I use to improve my hand eye coordination. I love how the rate of progression builds your mastery of the game. Recommended to all friends.
0880796863|5.0|I bought this as my first deck despite some of the negative reviews. The colors look fine despite what some people have said and the trademarking is so small you can barely see it without a magnified glass. Seriously, when I first got it I couldn't find the trademark! I expected it to be a lot bigger. Either way this is a great deck I'm a beginner and wanted to go with a classic to learn on!
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|This is so unfair at least select some stuff for my the demo and make a lit a lite version
0061906220|5.0|My granddaughter loved this book she want to read it all the time. sing along while i'am reading the story
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun you can go on Bridges and buy new people it is so awesome it is way better than timple run
B0071XO8RA|1.0|No use of pronouns the story drags on and on.  I will come back and finish it later.  I don't care for Juliet, the people from IT aren't evil or present enough to be bad guys.  The sheriff the deputy and the mayor all die in the first 30 mins of the book before you can build any empathy.  I will come back, try again.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|The great thing about this game is that with a little work you can upgrade your way to the top by purchasing new suits and improving the ones you have.. and arguably it will not take a ridiculous amount of time. I have not made a inn app purchase yet and I already have the middle tier suits. They are all unique with diff strengths and weaknesses, making a great payoff when you have enough credits to get the next suit, which in turn makes your runs a tad bit longer.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|I love the show and it was great to see that prime members can watch the entire series.<br />The quality is fantastic, depending on your media player and TV of course
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It's good for your kids and family members to help them to learn about the bible and they will love it
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Nothing but the story of Jesus gives a better more uplifting tale than this! I read this story every year.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I loved \\"The Ocean at the end of the lane.\\" I found the characters and the plot engaging, some genuinely scary characters (imagine an evil Mary Poppins!), and was sorry to see it end. I'm looking forward to reading more of Neil Gaiman.
B004J4XGN6|5.0|This lecture will expose you important tools that will help you thrive under contexts of extreme uncertainty.<br /><br />Nice approach, and a framework easy to understand with a lot of applications.
B00BPWDMP2|4.0|I bought this CD because of the song, &#34;Downtown&#34;.  But, I have enjoyed all of the CD.  Lady Antebellum is a top notch act.  This CD is recommended for anyone who likes country music and Lady A.
B009R5GR1K|3.0|I really like the dictionary and even bought the pro version because the ad implies that you can download the medical dictionary if you buy the pro version, but you can't. You can only use the medical dictionary with an Internet connection, not offline. It's still a good dictionary for $3.99.
B00005N5S2|5.0|Gregory Peck does a super acting job of one of our greatest general's. The special affects with a good script does justice to Hollywood.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is great fun for horse lovers like me! I have it on my kindle fire and play it all the time!
B001FVD65O|5.0|Starts out so nicely and then once your comfortable you begin to realize Christmas was not going to be a fire-place and toys.
B0009U5DD0|5.0|Bought it as a gift for someone that loves this group and she has been listening to it everyday since
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|this is a very good game that is why I gave it 5 stars this is a great game awsone
B00766CLPI|5.0|Barbra Streisand is the queen of music.  This an all her other cds are fabulous!  I love the music on this cd
B006IGZWB2|5.0|Awesome movie and must watch.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|They go on and off easily so they can be moved around. My princesses love decorating their room with them.
B006YXTRHY|3.0|Tipical Twilight......good to watch.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Love the game<br />Just wish there were an easier way to earn gold<br />LOVE THE FACEBOOK LINK<br />Thanks to my th friends for getting me hooked
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|Movie pretty good, action packed. Wouldn't recomend to children, not the fairy tale, and not fairy tale language. Enjoyed watching it.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|Great way to blow time, only you can not save the game when you need to upload a newer version you lose it.  This is my 3rd time.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Really like these guys! Look forward to a new CD. Their music is any where from relaxing and peaceful to plane out fun and punky. I also like how they take modern songs and add section of classic music to them, it's very cool! I give them a five because they know how to peak your interest and all the music isn't the same thing.

B00BWLKTOS|5.0|I really like this CD. The Piano Guys are really good. The thing I love is their style and arrangements. They take a lot of modern artist songs and show you the beautiful side of their music. It is also amazing the different things you can do with instruments even just one. They know how to add some spirit to their music without going overboard.
B00B4VI8MQ|2.0|Hard to find clues but good graphics. Would prefer to have levels of difficulty and easier to maneuver when changing direction. When you click an area game doesn't respond at times.
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|He is such a good actor, you have to like this kind of Action which I do. Better than Die Hard
B004G5VFOU|5.0|I bought the album when it first came and loved it. I love the alternate take of John Barleycorn and the live material.
B00CHILW64|5.0|The fact that this is a true story is amazing and to be recaptured in a movie was amazing. I don't think I could have been that strong to survive such a horrid experience.
B000056JYB|4.0|I was hoping for better material to fill out the extended/deluxe version of this cd. The booklet helps explain a lot about the choices of material.
B006R1T40I|5.0|I've been waiting for something new from Bonnie and was thrilled with the lyrics and music on this new CD.!  Bonie is as good as ever!
B000H0MKO2|5.0|I had to watch clips of this movie for school  When I purchased it just for personal benefit, the whole family likes it.<br />It's humorous with an underlying theme of rhetoric, manipulating people.<br />Different than most movies.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|It was a fun little movie and a creative re-imagining of the tale. The biggest let down is that Eleanor Tomlinson's character sadly never really lives up to her aspirations to be more responsible and instead goes from needing to be rescued one scene to another.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Don't let the Zombies put you off.  This book is very, very good.  This is one of the best reads I have had in quite a while.  It is not about the zombies but the personal views and coping of many people all over the world with the infection.  The author is interviewing people and giving us their stories.  Some of them are beyond excellent but all are good reads.  I did not want this book to end in fact I am re-reading it as it is so good
B008X9Z37A|3.0|This product lives up to its billing, but has one problem I didn't expect.<br />When 'tenting', the edges are so smooth that it just won't stand up on a smooth surface.<br />Almost have to stand it 'on-edge' to get it to tent.<br />Okay for protection, but that's about it.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I think this game is very addicting. GET THIS APP!!! WHO EVER RATED THIS APP ONE STAR IS A NOOB! :3
B008FRFN7A|5.0|I found this product promised a lot and delivered it all!<br />Couldn't believe how fast my new HP banged out a page, after sending it via my Kindle Fire.<br />It couldn't have been more satisfactory.<br />Strongly recommend this one.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|This book is very thought provoking. The plot is a little over the top but exciting and intricate. A little contrived but well put together.. I am a Christian but found myself agreeing with most of the underlying philosophy. I highly recommend this book.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Big fish games are always a blast. They hit out of the park with this one.<br />Really good game play. Easy to learn. Tons of fun.
B00CH87HF4|2.0|this was a ok game at first but when I tried to undownlaod it all the memory stayed on my kindle this is a rip off and it takes more than. 93 Gb of space
1451695195|5.0|I was the first to get to read the book, and could barely wait to get through it.<br />I was more than happy to pass it on to my guys for them to enjoy this book as well.<br />Next it goes to our rent lady. It will be shared with everyone we can think of.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest I use it every day its a great way to show other people what you like good job I'm not unhappy with this app at all.
B008M4MB8K|5.0|I love Blade Runner, it's one of my favorite movies from one of my favorite directors. I will say, though, that the US theatrical cut isn't great. The voiceover is just unbearable, and it has a lot of the more violent scenes cut.<br />Good thing is, though, this box set comes with 5 different cuts of the movie AND the unfinished Workprint version. I'd highly recommend watching 2007's Final Cut, which removes the Deckard voiceover completely, along with a few other changes. Then you can go back and watch the other cuts in whichever order you'd like.<br /><br />Definitely worth buying for any Ridley Scott or Blade Runner fans
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I don't think you shoud get it if you have a kindle fire because it won't install it is a terible app don't get it
B00D2K40WY|4.0|The game is really cool. My daughter enjoys designing outfits and doing makeup and hair. I didn't think it was going to be this good.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Easy access to usb ports<br />Easy to open and close with magnet to close Kindle down<br />Would buy again for the price
B002MQYOFW|4.0|That book was amazing. I loved every word of it. Even the ones I didn't quite understand. I totally recommend it.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Actually I will go crazy waiting for the next two parts...I am dying (no pun intended) to know what is in store for them especially knowing someone knows their secret...and who is it? I hope it doesn't take forever to get the answers
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game. it made me think of creative ways to use the hidden objects in the room to get the door open. I recommend it highly.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This application works very well. I have had no problems using it at all. It works just like a handheld.
B004H8GLXQ|1.0|The premise sounds promising...a popular author, who is nearing the end of her life, asks an amateur biographer (a young lady from a local used bookstore) to write her biography. The bookstore angle dragged me in, but I should have not taken the bait.<br /><br />Ms. Setterfield writes in a manner that should make readers of fine literature cringe. She beats an idea to death, and then when one finally thinks she is moving on to something else, she beats it some more. She will also spend a page or more describing an event or an object that is completely irrelevant to the story at hand.<br /><br />In 400+ pages, she provides not one, not two, but four different narrators to try to make some sense of the story. As a result, many of the sub-plots are repeated ad infinitum. If that, and the inability to maintain any type of chronology, don't annoy you, her equal inability to stick to a first or third person point of view, even within the narrative of a given person, will have you grinding your teeth.<br /><br />Also, one gathers that Ms. Setterfield expects us to be as excited and interested in the story of the author (Vida Winter) as her make-believe biographer (Margaret Lea) is. The subject of the \\"biography\\" has pathologically lied to every interviewer to date, and after 300+ pages, it is revealed that she is, if not lying, skirting the truth to Ms. Lea, as well. So the reader has spent over 75% of the book, listening to one person NOT tell the truth to another. I realize that it is a work of fiction, so there is no \\"truth\\". But it is akin to having a person read chapter after chapter of a story line, and then telling them that it was just a dream.<br /><br />In addition to Ms. Winter, and glutton-for-punishment Ms. Lea, all the other characters presented to the reader are boring in the least, and despicable at the worst. (Only Aurelius garnered any sympathy from this reader.) Ms. Setterfield must think that her \\"talented\\" writing will overcome disdain for the characters. She is sadly mistaken.<br /><br />Oh, if only I had back the hours I wasted on this junk. To paraphrase from the book.....\\"But I [have] never read any [Diane Setterfield]. Why should I when there [are] so many dead writers I still [have] not discovered?\\" This phrase was on page 29. I should have heeded the phrase and thrown the book aside.<br /><br />I suggest you do so....long before page 29.
B0015AARJI|5.0|excelente
B0042XA2U4|4.0|Took me a while to get through it, but the book overall was good. Haven't seen the movie in years but now that I've read the book I think I may give it another try. :)
B0034DGPEU|5.0|More than engaging, this book draws you in as if it's taking place in your world. The reader is not merely a spectator, but one of the characters. You want to reach out and help....
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I loved it! Once I started reading, it was hard to put down. The characters were real and the book extremely engrossing.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Useful, sleek, easy to use, always available, love that it's free. I need to do some reading up and maximize my use out of it
B0065UF2ZM|5.0|One of an excellent series. These books are great, read them all. I certainly am working my way through them.
B005LAIIN0|3.0|This was a great movie, however they should not have called it World War. It does not follow the book although there are a few refeances to stories from the book. They could have eaily made this more like the book had they just made Pitt a reporter who goes around and interviews people after the zombie outbreak. Still a good flick and worth seeing, especially if you are a zombie fan.
B00B1OWEVC|5.0|First off, like many have written. This is not a NIN album.<br /><br />The concept behind this album is the progressive loss of one's humanity in a world being taken over by machines due to technological progress outstripping our ability to cope with it. Individually these song are somewhat lacking but listening to the whole album you start to see the story and the world Trent and all the others are trying to create. Maandig's vocals provide a perfect offset of humanity trying to hold out as technology tries to take over. Throughout the album Maandig's vocals fight against the glitchy encroachment of technology, occasionally winning for a brief period before losing ground again. By 'Ice Age' you get the feeling of desolation as humanity is slowly losing the battle. By 'How long' you get the sense of humanity trying to make it's last stand. By the end of the album it is clear almost all humanity has been lost due to Maandig's vocals being relegated to brief repeating mantras while the glitchy sounds take primary focus with only the smallest glimmers of hope.<br /><br />It should be noted that there is very little sharp payoff. This album tries to stay very even toned to create a certain atmosphere. So you will not here much of Trent's classic rage, He mostly lets his wife have center stage while he provides some backup vocals. I personally think this fits with the theme of the album well.<br /><br />As a lover of post-apocalyptic stories and dreamscapes I found this album to be an amazingly atmospheric and moody album and wish I could learn more about this world HTDA made.
B009LGO88E|5.0|This thing works so well, I can't comprehend why &#34;N&#34; didn't make this standard with the 3DS XL. I absolutely love this peripheral. Nano Assault works flawlessly. Can't wait to try it with Monster Hunter Ultimate.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this ap because it is quick and easy.  I can also have a list of family and frien's cities so I know what their weather is.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|When I finally upgraded to an HD tv I just couldn't stand how terrible the PS2, Gamecube and Wii games looked. Sure the 360 and PS3 look fantastic but I still like to play my old library of games. Thank god for this bundle. 2 of my favorite titles from the PS2 era.
B002ZNJXP8|5.0|Good book - I'm not always a Tom Wolfe fan, but this did a good job of sharing with the reader the backstory of America's space program, with a cast that includes a group of test pilots &#34;pushing the envelope&#34; across the high desert of Southern California, a team of &#34;de-Nazified&#34; German rocket scientists who preferred chimpanzees in their capsules, various American political & cultural icons of the era jockeying for a moment in the spotlight, and (of course) the seven men who became America's Mercury astronauts.  She liked reading it, and I was glad to share it with her.<br /><br />The book also has the added benefit of giving needed context to the film of the same name, especially with regard to Chuck Yeager's story; a true American hero.
B002TXZT7A|5.0|Once again we have an entertaining read full of homespun wisdom African style. It takes the western reader back to a time when elders were respected and life was much simpler free of all the electronic devices that now rule our world. At the same time this novel demonstrates the maxim that human nature stays the same regardless of time or race. There is still jealousy and greed and love and envy as well as all the other vices. The motivations which drive these characters are the motivations which drive us all and that is the appeal of this book.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Not too hard but tricky enough to be fun. I enjoyed playing and will look out for new levels. Liked it
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Great story, great writing and the beginning of a great series. I just read the book a second time and still loved it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is a great way to pass the time.  It is not to hard and not too easy. More mini puzzles in each room would be the only improvement I would suggest.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I have trouble falling asleep and the white noise makes it so much easier! Haven't had any trouble sleeping since I have been using it. The great thing is that it can run all night and doesn't take up too much battery energy.
0425252868|5.0|If you're a WW 2 buff,a plane buff,you should read this book. The author did a tremendous job printing the lives of all the men involved in this particular odd real life episode. I was surprised that the book took such an in depth history of the Luftwafe pilot. His life story could be a book unto itself. Every once in a while I buy a book that's hard to put down. This is definately one of them. A few tears flowed at the end.<br />I highly recomend it.
B00274EYKY|4.0|I liked it, with many qualifications.  I was totally turned off by the language and sexual scenes (which I hurriedly fast forwarded through), but the sad story of a man so emotionally dependent on his &#34;image&#34; brought tears to my eyes.  I was able to see beyond the decadence to a man who destroyed himself and the genuine love he could have had, by his apparent need for the adulation of the crowd.
B000VHXD7O|4.0|This movie was good and I would recommend it to others. It was entertaining, enlightening, and educational. Add to your \\"to see list.\\"

B00CU0UE0E|5.0|I saw these guys when they opened for Imagine Dragons in Kansas City on June 28th, 2013 at Starlight Theater.  I had never heard of them before and I wasn't sure what to expect.  I got to say, if it wasn't already an outdoor venue with no roof they would have blown the roof off of that place.  I was hooked after the first song they performed. By the end of their performance there wasn't a single person in the place that wasn't jumping around going crazy dancing like a 70's disco star living in the 80's. There were 5 bands that night and in my opinion they were the best performance of the night (yes, even better than the main act). None of the other bands were bad, it's just that Capital Cities was in a totally different category all by themselves.  After seeing them live I came home and immediately bought the album from Amazon. If you love well written lyrics and music with a funky groovy techno beat then this album is a must buy.  If you ever get a chance to see Capital Cities live in concert then you should drop everything and go! Only thing I'm upset about is that I paid $6.99 for the mp3 album just a few days ago and now it is only $5! Whatever, it was a steal at $6.99 and $5 is a no brainer.  They really shouldnt be selling it for only $6.99 or $5.  I would have easily paid way more for this album.  It's just good music and that is hard to find now.
B008Y73940|5.0|Just rent it or buy, your choice. You'll like it. For both male and female, together, should enjoy. Action, suspense and Drama

B006MW3UZW|5.0|I had this series recommended to me, and I found myself immediately absorbed.<br />It's very well written,  and the actors make the characters come to life.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|No review necessary. Just read it and weep.<br /><br />Easily one of the bet books out there. No matter age or gender, this book means something. Something beatiful. Something ou never get tired of seeing. I hop you love it. because I do.<br /><br />I do.
034580709X|4.0|The Bat is was my introduction to Jo Nesbo and his series detective Harry Hole.  I'd heard some good things about the series, and having read the Wallendar series by Henning Mankell, I fully expected another excellent, bleak and moody Scandinavian mystery.  I was only partially right.<br /><br />The Bat, even though it is written by a Norwegian author and stars a Norwegian police detective, takes place in Australia (mostly in Sydney). I hadn't realized this was the setting, and I found it an interesting place to start a series.  That did away with the bleakness I was expecting.  However, The Bat was both moody and excellent.<br /><br />Harry Hole is a fascinating character, and in the vein of Harry Bosch, he is ripe for further development.  There are layers to the character that are slowly revealed, deepening the intrigue and adding to the mystery.  And like all great protagonists, Harry Hole is a flawed individual; he is a recovering alcoholic, amongst other personal problems.<br /><br />The mystery is involving, with many twists and turns.  Harry and his Australian \\"partner\\", Andrew Kensington (an Aborigine), track every lead and run across many colorful people in their investigation of the murdered girl.  A cross-dressing clown, an Aborigine boxer, a drug-dealer, a homeless man, and a beautiful Swede (whom Harry falls for) are among the strong supporting cast.  Interspersed with the investigation are tidbits about Australia's complicated social history, which add to the atmosphere.<br /><br />Finally, Nesbo's writing style was quick and crisp. There were never any large info-dumps, and the chapters moved quickly.  The dialogue was sharp and believable.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this novel and will definitely be picking up other books in this series. Like Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch series, the mysteries run a close second to discovering more of the unfolding life of Harry Hole. I highly recommend this book to mystery lovers.<br /><br />I received a review copy of this book from Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group and Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.
B00D8WJ9JK|4.0|J. Cole finally lives up to the hype with his latest effort. It's He's truly at his best when he isn't reaching for that #1 song. He's always had the kind of potential that would get him to a #1 song and/or album without trying so hard. That kind of talent is hard to come by. Therefore, I'll speak for all Hip-Hop fanatics and say; Good job Jay-Z.
B0091REZMW|4.0|the graphics are great. there seems to be a lot of puzzles and games built into the story. a fun way to pass the time.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I normally try to avoid these novels of those in horrible situations but truthfully they are the most exciting novels to be read. This one being exceptionally amazing. A good book will have you smiling, an amazing one will have you feeling emotions you never thought you contained and that's what this one does, rocks you to the very soul. If you can't handle gruesome scenarios such as rape but only romance then this isn't your book, this is a story about love and the life of a person you wonder how she's still standing.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Very good quality.  Item arrived fast and was packed very good.  We had searched for this movie for a long time and are very pleased with our purchase.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|You constantly have to refresh your notifications because the light will not come on right away. And if you press the &quot;see more button on a page, it will cause it to turn gray and blue and you can't interact with it. But other than that it's fine. They just need to update it.
B004J64QSI|5.0|This is how Les Miserables is to be sung! Alfie Boe is absolutely spectacular! Sheer perfection! He BECOMES JVJ. When he sings Bring Him Home, you can feel his prayer so powerfully. He is communicating with God. It is so beautiful! I have never heard anything more heavenly. Once you think it's all over, stick around for the BHH encore. Alfie takes it to the moon!

B0099Y2MYK|5.0|It was great to work my way  through Season 3.  All caught up and anticipating the beginning of  Season 4.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|Visually engaging and entertaining. Pretty standard &#34;fantasy&#34; fare with few novel ideas or images. A new take on an old story.
B004GJXQ20|5.0|If you love fantasy read this. If you like political thriller, read this. Wonderful piece of writing, delivered to my kindle touch within seconds of purchasing. Lightning fast service from amazon.
B002W7J3SO|5.0|This is classic.  Can watch over and over again. Bravo another great one from Hitchcock.  I would definitely recommend this one.
B009ANP4F4|5.0|Bought this as a gift for a friend and it turned out to be a wonderful movie that we both loved watching together. It didn't disappoint and had a pretty good plot.
B009NX409M|4.0|The actors were young so it was fun to see them back then. I liked how there was a moral reluctance for getting involved in an affair. That is missing in almost every movie these days.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME U HAVE TO GET IT!!!!!!! I'm like totally addicted to this game I play it all day everyday it's a good game for everyone even my great grandma loves this game so GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1781162646|5.0|I read all of Stephen King's books. This one was very different. A good book to sit down with and just read it as an entertaining book. I didn't have to put a whole lot of thought into it. The book was one of those books that you would like to read for pleasure and simple enjoyment.<br />Once again, I am a forever fan of Stephen King. I hope people would like it just for a different kind of read from his usual.
B0053JJLLC|4.0|An interesting story of a world that is both amazing and terrifying. I really enjoyed reading this book. Check it out
B00A2H9PLG|5.0|Seriously, folks. If it wasn't incredibly obvious from the previews this is another PG-13 Die Hard with a different protagonist. It's got all the hilarious quotable quips, loud explosions, elevator climbing, crashing, bullet-flying, popcorn action you'd expect. It's smartly written, well-acted, and entertaining from beginning to end. Is it ridiculous? Absolutely. Is it silly? Very. It's absolutely what you want and expect from a Die Hard movie. It's also the most likable Channing Tatum and Jamie Foxx have ever been in my opinion (yes, I actually sat through Step Up, She's the Man, Ray, and Stealth, slightly more traumatized with each new film).<br /><br />If you are expecting Independence Day or Stargate levels of over-the-top sci-fi battle-royale-with-cheese you will be disappointed. If you just want a rollicking good time with a Die Hard flick set in the White House you're probably going to love this movie. It doesn't have a SINGLE annoying character and I actually laughed at the jokes. The performances by the superb cast are uniformly excellent. The sound, effects, camera-work, and overall direction of the film do not disappoint. Highly recommended to action fans who like things on the over-the-top entertaining side you can crunch popcorn to and wash down with a Slurpee.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Great book to take you away from the real world for a short time. I look forward to reading the next one.
0307341550|5.0|great murder story with a crazy and unexpected twist at the end. giving you chills on the murders and decription of the killings. must read.

B00CF34B2I|3.0|I'm just getting started, but this game looks like a winner.  I used to play a lot of MTG:Online but stopped for quite a few years.  It's nice to see it on a tablet. I'm gonna get hooked, all over again.<br /><br />EDIT:<br /><br />After running through a few of the tutorials, I'm having to downgrade my review.  Why?  Because in the tutorial on Instants, the game froze at one point when I tapped the pause timer control.  It was completely borked.  Pressing the power button caused the screen to go black, but the music kept on playing.  I had to reboot my Kindle.  This does not make me happy.
B0067TQQI8|4.0|I've only had the this Anker for 6 weeks now and this is my findings. The good is you have portable power anywhere for any device which needs 5 volts and a USB cable to charge it. It weighs only about 8 ounces and is very compact, about one inch smaller than the iPhone 5 in length, same width but twice the depth. it has two outputs, one at 2A and one at 1A. Using the 2A charges an iPhone 5 twice as fast as the 1A output but I am not sure if this degrades the iPhone battery over time. The 2A output must be used to charge Tablets. It comes with a USB piggy tail curled short cable and three adapters which snap on the other end of the USB side. One is a micro USB which can be used to charge the Anker, one is an Apple 30 pin adapter for the iPhone 3's or 4's and the other is a mini USB adapter. If you lose the adapters the included cable is useless. You can use any micro USB cable to charge the Anker. If you have an iPhone 5 you must use your OEM lightning cable for charging.<br /><br />I have used the Anker to charge the iPhone 5, various iPod's, the Blackberry Playbook and Bluetooth ear bud type devices. One issue is the Anker will show 3 led's left in reserve and then cannot even charge my iPhone 5 to full. It is supposed to be 50-75% charged at 3 led's and `100% charged at 4 led's. Essentially you have to know the battery capacities of your electronic devices and re-charge it once you have used about 5,000 to 5,550 mAh of the Anker 8,400 mAh rated capacity or once it drops to 3 led's charge it up. Anker states this battery pack will consume about 30% of it's capacity in heat loss and power conversion. I'm thinking it's more like 35 to 40% loss. Anker claims it will provide 400% in charges for the iPhone which have 1,420 mAh to 1,440 mAh batteries depending on the model but that is overstated in my opinion. At first it was hard pressed to push 2.5  to 3 full charges of the iPhone 5 but seems to have gotten better after more use. I typically get about 3.5 charges of the iPhone 5 before the Anker is exhausted. I usually am using the iPhone while charging so that may contribute to less than 4 full charges as Anker claims it will give you.<br /><br />When you charge this Anker from 0% it takes about 6-7 hours to fully charge it using an Apple sugar cube 5V/1A charger. If I use my Blackberry Playbook rated at 5V/1.8A it takes only about four hours to fully charge. But the led's showing charge status are misleading. It will jump from one to two led's after about only 15 minutes of charging. Logic would dictate it should be one for the first hour then two thereafter so if you disconnect it before it is fully charged you may be surprised how quickly it goes dead.<br /><br />I have a New Trent IMP50D rated at 5,200 mAh and it would fully charge my iPhone 3 times with a little in reserve when it was brand new. But after about 1 year it was only putting out 2 full charges and then only 1.5 after 18 months. So the New Trent consumed only about 20% in heat loss/power conversion when new vs. about 35 to 40% for the Anker. And the three led's showing charge capacity on the New Trent were much more accurate vs. Anker's 4 led's. I paid $45 for the New Trent and $35.99 for the Anker with free shipping on both.<br /><br />The bottom line is you can't beat having the Anker with you when you are out and about to charge your USB 5 Volt electronics. If I am at Six Flags Great America, Chicagoland Speedway for 12 to 14 hours using 4G/LTE, surfing, listening to internet music, twittering and taking photos or watching the race on my phone for re-runs it keeps me fully charged all day. Otherwise my iPhone battery is exhausted in about 4 hours. No need to throttle back usage for fear of a dead battery. You can't beat the price and my only real complaint is the led's do not accurately reflect the charge status you have on the Anker when charging it or after you have used it to charge your devices.
B00AFEY354|5.0|This is a movie I can only compare to the Breakfast Club in a around about way its about the kids that go through a heap of stuff
B000NY12LO|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing. It is my favorite Jodi Picoult book and she did so much research for it. It's a great read about school shootings from the judge's, lawyer's, teens at the school (living of course) and a friend of the killer. You really see the truth about violence and bullying in schools as well as a bit of teen pregnancy and relationship abuse. Twist ending is great!
B00A81MV3U|5.0|This movie is a  great movie for mental health. I think that it shows people that you can beat the odds.
B005URRCUY|5.0|The Black Keys are a super fresh breath of air in this oversaturated pop market.  The \\"male\\" bands and \\"female\\" bands all sound the same; even the \\"rock\\" bands end up all synthed and whiney.<br /><br />Enter TBK:  real rock, real bass, real drums - passion.  This CD is in heavy rotation right now and it is one you can listen all the way through without skipping a song. If it is the first time you listen to it or the 75th, hearing the album, start to finish as a whole is never old or tiring.  Rock is back.
B00006JI11|5.0|This movie is so so funny there is no comparison I've never seen a movie like this one before ever.
0061122416|1.0|This is one of those books you keep reading and hearing about and you wonder if it's any good. I found it in a post-yard sale \\"Free\\" box outside a house yesterday: guess no one wanted to buy it for 25 cents - and now I know why!<br /><br />Yuck, yuck, yuck.<br /><br />I struggled through it in a few hours, and became increasingly annoyed as I went along. This book is 177 pages of trite self-help garbage, not-so-cleverly disguised as a novel. And this is the most translated book of any living author?!  Well, you know what they say: thousands of flies on a pile of cow dung doesn't mean the cow dung is any good!<br /><br />And the dude doesn't even have the decency to credit the sources he blatantly ripped off - see the Wikipedia entry for more info. Ouch!<br /><br />What a hack.<br /><br />Read 'The Great Gatsby', folks: it's sheer perfection and the only American novel you need to read if you just read one in your lifetime.
0988262592|5.0|So many reviews have already hit the mark on how great this book is that I simply want to add my agreement that this is a \\"must read\\" for all IT and DEV/Ops leaders.
B00BSN0K1C|5.0|A really nice figure of man of steel. Mattel has done a really great job. It shows perfect the new costume.
B005MVIF7M|5.0|I think I was one of the few Wilco fans who was not disappointed with Wilco (The Album) so maybe I'm just a fanboy.  But I really liked this one.  It's nearly a masterpiece and has, to me, one of the greatest songs they've ever done in One Sunday Morning.  They prove, once again, that you can make catchy, interesting music based in simplicity.  They have rarely done anything Earth-shattering in terms of song structures (keys, modes, meters, etc) but always find ways to embellish the simplist pieces to make them transcendant.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|interesting,not so hard that it is discouraging but hard enough to be challenging. a bit addictive I like it and recommend it
0307476073|3.0|While it is certainly an accomplished feat to say the least....this account of Ms. Strayed's hike is so self-indulgent and frankly quite boring that I wished for the hike to be over at times as much as Ms. Strayed at times yearned for it to be done.  It is an interesting read and one does learn alot about what NOT to do when undertaking an adventure of this nature but I kept shaking my head at Ms. Strayed's naivity and poor judgment.  I only thought the book so-so.  Call me judgmental but I was really expecting something a bit more insightful of the larger aspects one would ponder on their \\"spirit walk\\" other than when of if they would need the condom they packed.
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|Justin Tiberlake is back! Not that I ever doubted him! Justin, you belong in music! This is a great album! And my MP3 sounds great! I love it! Thanks, Amazon
B00BR0SGN0|3.0|Thats what I said, after giving this a spin.<br />Not sure what the goal was here, but I was<br />not impressed.  After reading various reviews,<br />I felt sure this would be better Its true that<br />the production is bolder than Rapture of the Deep, and<br />the songs are a little harder. Also, there are a couple of<br />decent tracks on this offering.  However, this album seems to<br />have too much keyboard, and not enough guitar for my liking.<br />Maybe it will grow on me.  Time will tell.
0988262592|5.0|Having spent the last ten years studying ITIL and similar IT management frameworks, I was impressed at how much was brought into this book. It flows well and IT practitioners will identify with some of the anecdotes, while IT process geeks will recognize many of the fundamental concepts that make IT work for consumers.  Well worth the time.
B000KIPT30|4.0|I purchased this because I am going to be starting a podcast with a couple of my friends and we all needed to be able to monitor the sound as we do the podcast.  My mixing board (Zoom R16) only has one monitor out, so this HA400 seemed to fit our needs.  When reading the product description it said incredibly clear even near full volume.  Well, first, let's put this into perspective - this is a $20 4 way headphone amplifier.  Here's what I can tell you from my brief trials so far (used a set of Audio Technica M50's as well as some Beyerdynamic DT-990 Premium 250 ohms just to test out the power output and clarity) - this unit will be perfect for monitoring levels and ensuring we keep our faces in front of the microphones.  Same could be said of people wanting to use this with some sort of band setup - it will be good for monitoring levels...HOWEVER, while the clarity is fine, it definitely gets muddy and busy when there's a lot going on - in other words, this is not made for listening to music or even for doing studio type edits on music.  Honestly, if I were doing something along the lines of playing in a band, I would likely invest quite a bit more money into the headphone amplifier just to get pristine sound.<br /><br />Again, wrapping up here.  This product will do what I want it to - allow us to make sure our levels are good and keep us from straying too far from the microphones while doing our podcast.  For $20, the fact that I can individually control all four headphones with separate volumes and the fact that it pushed both sets of headphones I hooked up to it without much of a problem (the 250 ohm set had to be turned up quite a bit, but it still worked), then I'd have to say this is a bargain.  It sounds a bit like listening to a 64-80 bitrate MP3.  Not bad but not great.  Perfect for what we're going to use it for.

B00BPA6XUK|4.0|I enjoyed the movie and only vaguely was aware of the music. After hearing several tracks at B & N, I ordered it. I was amazed to find it is basically put together by one person electronically. I find myself playing it very loud in my Z on the freeway when there is no traffic. Love it.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|I thought I'd love this.

B000NY12LO|5.0|Jodi Picoult is a genius/artist when it comes to writing novels.  I don't know how she does it.  Couldn't put this book down. This story had a couple of characters who were also in a previous book of hers, which took me by surprise-in a good way.

B000NQRE9Q|4.0|Although the 2nd and 4th movies weren't very good, the price and quality of the item made it well worth buying all 4.  It comes in an adventure book that looks like a hard back comic! Cool!
B0000714BP|4.0|Lots of fun, good performances. Best quote:<br /><br />Noxeema Jackson: When a straight man puts on a dress and gets his sexual kicks, he is a transvestite. When a man is a woman trapped in a man's body and has a little operation he is a Transsexual. When a gay man has way too much fashion sense for one gender he is a drag queen.<br /><br />It loses focus here and there, but is well worth watching!

B004HWYTP4|4.0|For some mindless entertainment, it was a relaxing movie to watch! I think it was more the humor that they used in the story that made it entertaining. And maybe some of us can relate to being older and considered out of it!

B00005Q45W|4.0|I like his music, but I figured out after listening a few times that most of them sound exactly the same, so I get sort of bored with it.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Great movie with eye opening scenes. I recommend it to anyone looking to understand the culture of the south back 200 years ago.
B0002S947K|5.0|I just love this guy!  The lyrics, the music, the voice....easy on the ears all day long!  Just love me some Ray LaMontagne!
1466401885|5.0|loved this book and finished it in a week, just couldn't put it down. I would recommend this one as well as Travis' version, Walking Disaster.
B001AX9DT0|5.0|Just found this man, and I plan on getting a lot more of his music.  He has such an easy manner and wonderful lyrics.
B009GED3HS|5.0|This is a great show representing the transition from your 20's into your 30's and realizing you haven't accomplished everything you set out to do. Well written show with great characters, with awesome references to 80's and 90's culture.<br />Your left wondering every week, when the hell is he going to meet their mother!!!
B004W1GCNC|4.0|as a fan of Downton Abbey, I was drawn to watch this.  I am fascinated by the lifestyle and traditions of the<br />British, and this series provides a glimpse into that lifestyle.  It seems to be a more lighthearted series, with Season 1 ending on a happy note.  I would recommend it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I just love it!<br />Great escape from modern everyday life ~ I am captured by all the characters and although saddened every time by the dramatic twists, I can't get enough.<br />Refreshing!<br />Due to a very erratic schedule ~ so grateful I can watch at my leisure!
0736083863|5.0|Explanations easy to understand.<br />Step by step instructions.<br />Explains the correct posture as well as the incorrect posture, so you can check your exercise pose.
B00BBI9WD6|4.0|This book has one of my all time favourite 'girl power' moments. Honor Harrington is definitely not someone to be messed with.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Enjoyed this game but I need more levels, asap!  I was disappointed when I came to the end of the game.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very fun! Can't wait for more rooms!! Some people complain that its too easy, but I really enjoyed it because it did get too hard but it was definitely more challenging that I anticipated after reading some of the reviews.
0316228532|1.0|i found this book tedious to to the extreme, i am an HP fan and i will admit a bias but that does not change the fact that it is as entertaining as reading a 13 year old girls diary. the characters are incredibly well developed and feel very real and very believable but there is no story.
B00AJLHUA8|5.0|This movie is hair-raising. It has a dark film noir look to it that adds to the creepiness of the overall story. Especially creepy is the actual old film projector used and the times the main character gets caught in the projection area are chilling. I have watched this movie twice now and shown it to most of my family members.
B00CDT41RY|3.0|Too much fighting and violence, story line could have be enhanced with less blood special effects.  Enjoyed the story and the era.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Visually stunning; fine acting; intriguing plot.  Not perfect, but one of the very best programs on TV.  Mads is great.
B006N0YWGY|4.0|A little difficult to control at first, after play for a while it's a fun game.<br />I like it<br />Tom
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Fictional charters who portray the desire, emotions and fears of a world in revolution.  Decaying aristocratic royalty giving way to free thinking working class also troubled with how best to governed without slipping into total anarchy  a realistic story how the Great War to end all wars was unavoidable.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I bought this for my son and had it shipped directly to him.  He posted that he had the best mom ever so I'm thinking it was a big hit!
B00499NHLC|5.0|I have many friends who are fans of the show, and honestly they have gone on and on about it so I was concerned that they where building it up to much. I am happy to say that it lives up to all the hype. It is worth watching and hard to not enjoy.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|I love this camera connection kit!!  I haven't touched my PC since i got my iPad 2 last Christmas and love that all of my pictures from my iPhone sync automatically.  However sometimes I enjoy using a regular camera as well.  This little kit makes importing pics simple and easy either using your memory card or usb cable.  All of my videos uploaded too, which is great since I plan on starting a youtube channel and need to be able to upload quality videos easily.  I highly recommend this product!
B00CGPPMKU|4.0|Its OK...you draw your finger around the screen....plus...its way behind the Google play version....but for the free app of the day I guess why not?
B007KZY1YY|5.0|It's again a very crisp book...enjoyed it totally...can't wait to read the last one in the series!!cheers..downloading the 3rd book right away!!
B00425S1H8|5.0|My old Belkin serial to usb adapter never had offical windows 7 drivers, but the chipset did. Not sure what changed but it would not allow me to send a break command on cisco routers.<br /><br />This one works right out of the box. I was able to reset the password on my test routers within minutes.
B001XUPGLY|5.0|This movie gives us a glimpse of why everyone should respect our natural resourses. Take care of and respect our world for generations to come. If we don't take are of this world where will we live.
1594488886|5.0|I finished this novel in 2 days- it has been a long while since that last happened.<br /><br />This novel is a story about two women in Afghanistan. They had very different upbringings but they both displayed strengths that are very admirable.<br /><br />When I picked up this book at the airport I was a little apprehensive because a part of me didn't think that the experience would match up to the one I had with The Kite Runner a few years ago. It did.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like the challenge the game presents to me. And it is great traveling. You can use it on planes or in cars. Also it is a nice game used to pass time.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I absolutely love this show. Can't wait for the new season!!<br />WWHD? (What would Harvey Do?)<br />Probably one of the best Shows on USA
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it. It's a great time waster and a lot of fun. Like a copy of temple run, but better.
B0090KZDSK|4.0|I liked the book a lot, though the ending was pretty disappointing... When I found out there would be another book I was relieved but still, the ending could be better! In some way it seems as if the writer was in a hurry to finish it...<br /><br />othet than that it was great!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is a game that almost everyone can play and enjoy because of the obstacles that need to be dodged and all the new characters that can be bought in the store.
B0017VG69U|5.0|I have to admit- I only became a Trekkie recently, thanks to the 2009 Star Trek and the new Into Darkness. I know that there seems to be a lot of the original Star Trek fans that dislike the new version, but I got into Trek thanks to Abrams.<br /><br />I love the Reboot version. Thanks to meeting the characters in the Abrams!verse, I wanted to learn more about the original Spock and original Jim, so decided to give TOS a try. I'm glad that I did. I can now say that I actually like TOS better than the Reboot... and that is coming from a person who got into Trek THROUGH the Reboot.<br /><br />The character interactions are beautiful. Jim and Spock's friendship is heart-warming. Spock and McCoy's bickering, but clear admiration for each other, is beautiful. Add in the plot of each episode, the (remastered) effects, mix well, and you have the perfect concoction.<br /><br />Quality television, plain and simple. They just do not seem to make television like this anymore.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game its so fun cause u get to. take care and play and have fun with our horses
160774273X|5.0|I look for artisan bakeries as the first step in finding out what is good about any city I am visiting if only for a day or two.  I found Ken Forkish's  Ken's Artisan Bakery in Portland many years ago and have obtained  his bread since then through the kindness of anyone I know who was traveling to or through that city, since he steadfastly refused to sell through the mail.  I have been baking with leavening made from the yeasts and bacteria in the air we breathe for 40 years and never achieved quite the results I wanted until I received my copy of Flour, Water, Salt, Yeast.  Not Robertson, Silverton,nor any other authors in the shelves full of bread baking books were able to give me quite the techniques nor comprehension needed to achieve what I am finally able to produce.  My so very patient SO finally said, without prompting, that she is totally spoiled and all other breads available here are simply not worth eating.  Mr. Forkish deserves my great admiration for the story he tells and the results I have finally produced thanks to him.<br />I have sent copies to all my home baking friends and they have all expressed their thanks for this wonderful teacher's book.
B0037WP83M|5.0|This movie was absolutely perfect for a road trip of plane ride if you have the means I highly recommend it.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|It just doesn't get any better for drama, dialogue, or great acting.  Clearly the best BBC production ever.  The social history is accurate and the production simply superb.
B007ZXK08C|1.0|I hated this book; the characters are not well developed and are not in the slightest way, believable.  Despite reviews that said I would be surprised at the outcome, I was not.  The plot development is slow and laborious, it is clumsily written and could do with some thorough editing. I could go on by why waste my time?
B008OOYALE|5.0|This is a great game to play. Its highly addictive and easy to follow for someone used to console games. Worth inviting friends to play and enjoy!
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|Love this game.  Started playing and didn't want to stop. Found it hard to put down. Reminds me of the old school galaga, which was a blast. Can't get past the boss in level 80 though, any hints?  Glad I downloaded it when it was free. Well worth it if you have to pay.  Works great on Kindle HD
B0058SNIC6|5.0|These are great! Stylish, comfortable, water proof, cushy. everything you need in a summer shoe!<br />My feet are VERY HAPPY!
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|Full of depth , intensity and brooding emotion. Though not without the dark humorous , double edged witt that composer Josh Homme has so finely honed. Overall The new Qotsa Sounds great and the music feels good.<br /><br />So sit back and listen. You will be glad you did !!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|challenging &amp; fun,  I haven't played games like this since I was little. some clues are obvious some are more clever.
B004GYY714|5.0|I like tune in radio, and now I can listen to it anywhere with my son's kindle fire.  The price was right too.
0920668372|5.0|Such a classic story. I often give this book as a part of a baby shower gift. It is precious.
159463176X|2.0|I am so sad to say that Khaled Hosseini's new book, And the Mountains Echoed, did not meet my expectations of a good or even somewhat good book. Having read his first two books and liked them very much, having looked forward to reading this new book for a long time, I met frustration when reading Hosseini's book. I had a hard time following the stories of all the characters that are introduced in And the Mountains Echoed. I kept wondering how the characters could/would come together and meet in a logical and/or emotional way, how the author would develop the relationships so that the excellent beginning of the book would make it through over 300 pages to a sensible and hopefully, powerful conclusion. There were times when I did not know who was speaking or even if the person was a male or female doing the speaking.<br />It is  true that there is some beautiful writing in the book, but what were the themes of the book? What did Hosseini hope to achieve in this chopped up book? I wondered if the author took separate short stories and hooked them together based on the theme of people finding each other, one story after the other?<br />I almost never write reviews when I do not understand the author's intent in a book: I blame myself for misunderstanding the author's intent. But with this book, I took my time reading it and ended up  feeling frustrating. Our book group WILL NOT  read this book. So Sorry to say that. NanS
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|A reely cool game and I like it a lot I mean a lot!?!?!<br />I give this game a five star rateing!
B00004Y6NU|5.0|I heard some of the songs on classicrawk.com and was real happy to hear some new to me songs by Dire Straits.
B001BANK32|5.0|OK, so I'm a few decades behind here. Of course, I've seen the movie several times, but, though a long time SK fan, I'd never read this particular novel. I'm so glad I finally did!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a very well done app. I especially like the charging graph. The voice alerts are also very handy. It's configurable in lots of neat ways. 5 STARS!!
0141192453|5.0|I loved the binding and printing, very good quality paper with boomark-tassle inside. It was a gift so I'm not sure about the story specifically...
B002NT3B52|5.0|Excellent, if you want to know how a dog thinks.  Down to earth writing, easy to understand for the lay person.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Take that reputation of darwinism, religion and all of its crazy denominations. Way to chop it up Ridley can't wait to see what's next.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|Loved the story lines, working together to create an emotional experience it was a sweet and endearing look at the strength of love and the bonds we create
B004X6PRO6|5.0|I have never read a book quite like this one!  There are parts that are terrifying, gruesome and hard to get through but other beautiful,  moving philosophical statements that mark this work as a massive must-read.  Somehow both parts are necessary in achieving the rollercoaster ride of a story that captures both what is beautiful as well is almost unspeakable in life.
B007N0REX6|5.0|I could listen to this music for hours. Slash's playing is so awesome to listen to. Lots of solos. Myles Kennedy is an awesome vocalist.
0989524116|4.0|I received a copy of this book from the author and enjoyed it thoroughly. The characters draw the reader in and the plot keeps one on your toes. However, I was disappointed that this second book did not wrap up as nicely as the first in the series as it left it on a much larger cliff with many things still in the air. On the other hand, this is the same reason that will keep me looking forward to the final book in the series.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Like it so far,  been playing for two days. Better than most building games, just have to build up game coins to get things moving, patience.:-)
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this game is simple yet fun. it will keep you trying for hours to beat each course. very fun and additive game.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|Good movie - my only critical comment is the sound -- often the main character (christopher waltz) is soft spoken and even with my surround sound setup you have to adjust the volume to pick up his voice (annoying).  I don't think it's the DVD, its just the overall sound editing of the movie
B008NW67E0|5.0|I will plan to get previous albums based on this CD. Very cool music for every part of my day.
B00ADS98FC|4.0|This movie has more of an emotional tie for me than anything else.  However, with that aside, it is a decent movie and the music is pretty great as well.
B009P5S11G|5.0|This is my 2nd Rihanna CD and it starts off with the typical Rihanna style. From the 1st song to the last it has a perfect flow and rhythm. I just love Rihanna's kick ass style.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|this app is spoon fun but the computer hallways skips moves that a actual person would do like they don't take my free queen or move their queen. if that gets fixed 5 stars.
B008J34466|3.0|...but this CD could have been much better. It is broken- the flow sucks and some of her songs are still immature. I am a steadfast Pink fan, I think she is amazing. This CD showcases a few beautiful ballads that are familiar, but I wanted to hear more unknown songs that really make you fall in love with her music and her powerful voice all over again. Disappointing, though this will not be my last Pink purchase... a fan forever! She is awesome!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Makes you think. Great for problem solving skills. Can't wait for more levels. The only thing I would have liked is the option for a hint. Not sure how that would work, though. That said, I'm glad in the end I had to figure it all out on my own, without hints.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|Just as advertised , this is a well made toy Sonic Screwdriver.  I am really happy with it.  Looks good up close and far away and it is just fun.<br /><br />Well worth it if you are a doctor who fan.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Amazing book, i read this in one shot. Author has done amazing job at giving important Message with creative writing.
B00CKJ2KK2|4.0|This game is extremely fun but needs some work.  First of all it takes up way too much space on your device which makes it take extremely long to download.  I suggest that most of the app be housed inside gamelofts main computer at their headquarters such as the gamelofts game &quot;world at arms.&quot; Second, there are not enough maps and classes in the game.  If they can extend the variety of maps and classes, I would give the game a five star rating.
B0049J3QF4|4.0|I really don't like that this movie has a &#34;G&#34; rating.  It has several words in it that are objectionable to those with young kids.  For example, Lightning McQueen says he's stuck in &#34;Hillybilly Hell&#34; when he gets to Radiator Springs.  There are some other objectionable things like name calling &#34;moron&#34; and &#34;idiot.&#34;  There is another scene in the courtroom where Mater says that another character &#34;just likes me for my body.&#34;  The last objectionable thing is where McQueen is talking about Hudson Hornet winning &#34;Piston Cups.&#34;  Mater says &#34;He did what in his cup?!&#34;  Ok, the last one made me laugh hysterically and a toddler wouldn't get the joke.  It's just the point that a &#34;G&#34; rated movie has any objectionable language at all.  Otherwise, really cute movie.
B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|J Cole comes with lyrics and creativity as usual, Great CD to buy. You see clearly that Cole has grown in Born Sinner.
1400069807|5.0|And take notes. I'm still in sugar shock to find my favored healthy yogurt, 6 ounces has almost 5 teaspoons of sugar. As another junk food commercial might paraphrase, \\" I could have had a Dove chocolate bar!\\" Least I wouldn't eat the whole thing at one sitting.<br /><br />This book actually has changed my life, leading to writing about a blog about it under Bon Bini Ya'll. and FREE rice mixes my husband was given at a recent convention in Chicago that have one quarter to one third of recommended max amount of sodium a day; gone. Trashed. As was a famous canned tomato..and pasta sauces.<br /><br />Even flu doesn't try to KILL its prey, what it lives on.<br />It's time the food companies learn the same.
B000RPCK1U|4.0|I have not had a chance to watch and or review this movie as I've not had the time yet. I'm looking forward to it.
B00BHAT2AQ|1.0|It took me over 2 hours to watch an episode less than an hour long due to buffering and stuttering audio trying to catch up, even with Amazon's own meter telling me I have a great connection rate.  Never have this problem with Neflix, and I don't have to pay by the episode for that, on top of my Prime subscription.  Last time I will...ruined my experience of an otherwise good show.
B001PPLIEG|4.0|Have not had a chance to watch / and or review this movie as I have not had the time. I am looking forward to it.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Up until now, my favorite works by Stephen King have been The Stand and The Dark Tower series. While I still love both of those, this one really hit me hard. I'm actually tearing up slightly while I type this, just thinking about the story! The research was very well done, and while I realize much of it was dramatized, it was done in a realistic way. I could almost see the sites mentioned in the book, and the time period in which they took place. If you are into Time Travel or Stephen King, or even just History/JFK/Oswald, then this is a must read!
B00005ABTT|4.0|I have not had a chance to watch and / or review this movie as I have yet to have the time.
B00CELB94E|5.0|Different Gear was more my gear, but I like this one too.  Is it just my copy, or does the CD have problems with skipping?<br /><br />Somebody didn't like my review.  I don't blame them because I did make it very brief.  It doesn't rock like their first CD.  It may be more mature, as another reviewer has said, but rock and roll has no business being mature.  Keep it short, sweet, simple, with riffs and hooks, and leave them wanting more.  To be fair, they weren't aiming for that.  This album has more of a Pink Floyd influence, and I think something like Apples in Stereo, and the Zombies.<br /><br />I'm just saying to potential buyers, that if you want something like their first album, that rips the joint like the Stones, you are going to be disappointed.  I love the third song, and a couple of the others will grow on you.
B000M53GM2|4.0|I have not been able to view this DVD yet as I have ordered so many. I look forward to it though. It arrived very quickly and in very good condition. Thank You.
B001NAT05W|2.0|The only reason I gave this two star is because it has Halle Berry in it wearing outfits that dont leave much to the imagination.<br /><br />I've seen more realistic fight scenes in Disney cartoon. The plot could have been somewhat tolerable if they'd stuck to the Comics and not made it some teenage bubble gum movie.<br /><br />booo
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This app is great for your brain! You have to remember numbers, colors, etc in orders and such. Great app!
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|The gods of cinema and of film restoration blessed film and Blu-ray enthusiasts when &#34;Lawrence of Arabia&#34; was released first on truly large theatrical screens and then on home screens last fall.<br />The new 400K process has created the most richly detailed and densely textured version of this truly epic film that this film lover has ever seen across 51 years and multiple incarnations: big screen, videotape, laser disc, DVD, and now Blu-ray. &#34;Lawrence&#34; was the centerpiece of my film class unit on epic/war films so I saw it twice a day on some occasions. Factoring in theatre, school and home viewings in 5 different formats, I estimate that I've seen &#34;Lawrence&#34; over 60 times; thus I can truly say that the new Columbia Blu-ray is among the best in the format and worthy of purchase in either the stand alone version or as part of the box set. If there were seven stars available for an Amazon rating or even ten, &#34;Lawrence of Arabia&#34; the Blu-ray would be worth every one.<br />Initially,  I was impressed by the complex brilliance of Peter O'Toole's characterization ( for me, the best of the decade and of his career) and Robert Bolt's and Michael Wilson's fine compression of Lawrence's &#34;Seven Pillars of Wisdom&#34;, rendered through Freddie Young's superlative cinematography and Maurice Jarre's haunting score, all unerringly supervised with consummate vigor, taste and grace by David Lean at the peak of his career. Lean, Young, Jarre and editor Anne Coates won well deserved Oscars, as did the film itself.<br />In recent viewings, I have also come to realize that &#34;Lawrence&#34; is a crash course in contemporary Middle Eastern politics, especially those of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Syria and Iraq. Claude Rains's elegant chess player of a diplomat emerges as the prototype of the British and French imperialists who carved up the remains of the Ottoman Empire into the unsteady states afflicted by tribalism and factionalism that we see today.<br />In an all male cast anchored by Alec Guinness's supremely intelligent and smooth as silk Prince Feisal, Omar Sharif of the elegantly liquid eyes offers the possibility of parliamentary democracy and Anthony Quinn, Hollywood's all purpose ethnic brawler, is his opportunistic and tribal-centered adversary.<br />Anne Coates's razor sharp and always judicious editing is even more notable in this majestic Blu-ray iteration: from extinguished match to rising desert sun, from apparent mirage to black clad enforcer (Sharif) of desert water-based justice, from accelerating motorcyclist (at the beginning) to Lawrence viewed through a glass darkly (the dirty windshield of a jeep) at the end, the work of the hundreds of artists and artisans who made &#34;Lawrence&#34; is honored and immortalized by &#34;Lawrence of Arabia&#34; the Blu-ray. Behold it and wish that you could step into the screen; behold it and be amazed by filmmaking and video restoration at its finest.day.<br />In an all male cast anchored by Alec Guinness's supremely intelligent and smooth as silk Prince Feisal, Omar Sharif of the elegantly liquid eyes offers the possibility of parliamentary democracy and Anthony Quinn, Hollywood's all purpose ethnic brawler, is his opportunistic and tribal-centered adversary.<br />Anne Coates's razor sharp and always judicious editing is even more notable in this majestic Blu-ray iteration: from extinguished match to rising desert sun, from apparent mirage to black clad enforcer (Sharif) of desert water-based justice, from accelerating motorcyclist (at the beginning) to Lawrence viewed through a glass darkly (the dirty windshield of a jeep) at the end, the work of the hundreds of artists and artisans who made &#34;Lawrence&#34; is honored and immortalized by &#34;Lawrence of Arabia&#34; the Blu-ray.

B0047Y0FGY|4.0|This lady's humor shines thru.  Reading about her early years puts a prospective on her current life.  Her view on life is just plain funny and full of insite.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|It's funny to young kids, older kids, and adults. But the adult humor doesn't make you wonder and hope the kids don't 'get' it. Don't tire of seeing it on while they watch...yet anyway.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A frustrating but absorbing and compelling<br />game. The background music adds to the gameplay but may not be everyone's cup-of-tea.

B009HXG9UQ|5.0|Plus Bill Murray, Bruce Willis and Frances McDormand are in it, some of my favorite actors. I enjoyed this immensely.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I was really excited i got this game but i really didn't like the quality at all the animals looked wierd  also it was short no good  i prefer survival craft
B00992CF6W|3.0|You could barley do anything but move around. And I got stuck in most of my worlds. I think they could make this app better. And relly $7.00 for an app :(
B0014VQGX4|5.0|Bought this for my son who is really into backhoes.  He absolutely loves it!  So realistic looking and a perfect size.  He is two years old and has broken this smaller bucket off of the back but it is still quality, he is a little rough on toys.

B00CF34B2I|5.0|If you always wanted to try Magic, and wanted a cheap way to get into it, you're in luck. It has good tutorials and even an introduction to the Limited format. For people who have already played the previous installments,  they've expanded upon the deck building even more. You can now adjust land amounts.
B005LHOKFS|4.0|This app is pretty helpful.  You have to pay attention to where the reviews come from as people from different cultures have differing criteria from which they base their opinions.  This app is only as good as the input provided by its users.
159463176X|5.0|I love Khaled Hosseine's writing. I read his last book and consequently was anxiousto read this one.I was  not dissapointed.
B0000793ZA|5.0|As obnoxious as it is to some people to base ones opinion on a bands music based solely on how neglected they were in their day, Simple Minds would seem to be a genuine example of that. Very unfairly dismissed by all too many as a bit of a one hit wonder due to \\"Don't You Forget About Me\\" from the iconic [[ASIN:B000002GD4 The Breakfast Club: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]]. Fact was however,Simple Minds had a popularity of another kind. And it had nothing to do with hits. That might've had to do with the fact the new wave/new romantic world was flooded with dozens of unique and vital musical voices raising themselves,especially in Europe,during the late 70's and early 80's of Simple Minds' heyday. Musically however this 1984,produced by U2's paramour Steve Lillywhite  tells its own unique story.<br /><br />  Okay so...Jim Keller's voice is not particularly different than any baritone range male new wave/synth pop lead singer of his era. In a way,that's part of his appeal-the way he weaves throughout the songs like a needle through thread. What really makes this album is the music itself. \\"Book Of Brilliant Things\\" and \\"C Moon Cry Like A Baby\\" are two personal favorites of mine-exquisitely crafted numbers showcasing a perfect hybrid between post punk and post disco-two entirely different musical ethics occurring at roughly the same time frame. \\"Up On The Catwalk\\",\\"Speed Your Love To Me\\",\\"Waterfront\\",\\"White Hot Day\\" and \\"Shake Off The Giants\\" have this unique take on a stadium rock sound with a strong psychedelic wall of sound-where huge washes of guitars and synthesizers creating these swelling yet very basic melodies.<br /><br />  The lighter electronic pulses of \\"East At Easter\\",the heavily melodic march of \\"Street Hassle\\" and the fiercer guitar rocker of \\"The Kick Inside Of Me\\" round out this album. While apparently a significant change in direction for Simple Minds, this album is far from a copy of U2's sound. From what I hear on this album guitar player Charlie Burchill has a guitar style easily equal to The Edge-a heavily reverbed ringing quality and a strong ability to improvise rhythmically. Their huge sound that was presented on this album was very theatrical and ideal for the film soundtrack work this band (and members of it) would very soon become strongly associated with. But for those looking into a good introduction to Simple Minds and the more ambitious end of their elastic sound, this wouldn't be a bad place to start.rlie Burchill has a guitar style easily equal to The Edge-a heavily reverbed ringing quality and a strong ability to improvise rhythmically.

B0000793ZB|5.0|Musically both important post punk bands in Europe, Simple Minds seem to be diminished in many ways by their comparisons to the more commercially popular U2. Of course in terms of location its the difference between Ireland and Scotland. Individually Simple Minds with Jim Kerr projected a more aloof tone than the emotive Bono. So I'm not going to compare them anymore than people already have. Its the individuals music that matters. And Simple Minds sound really isn't as much of a clone of U2's or anyone else's as one might think. On this 1985 album, the band were poised for bigger pop success with producer Jimmy Iovine. For starters,it would be hard to describe this as a musical clone of its predecessor.<br /><br />  The opening title song,\\"All The Things She Said\\" and \\"Ghost Dancing\\" are all strong uptempo numbers. These are songs based more heavily in rhythm and very groove centered dance/rock type numbers. \\"Alive And Kicking\\" is a very heavily harmony based number with one of those strong 1-2 kicks on the drum breaks and a very well arranged and memorable vocal chorus. \\"Oh Jungleland\\" is another very strong groove centered rhythmic number-same goes for \\"Sanctify Yourself\\". Both \\"I Wish You Were Here\\" and the closer \\"Come A Long Way\\"? Well they are very strongly in the U2 vein I suppose. On the other hand even bigger things were about to happen with Simple Minds' career-for better or worse.<br /><br />  On this album,the more rock oriented new wave sounds of even their previous release [[ASIN:B0000793ZA Sparkle in the Rain]] gives way to a more groove based dance/funk sound that is often based in layers of poly-rhythms as opposed to big sounded stadium rock style drumming. There's a heavy percussive flavor to most of the uptempo numbers here, and only on a few numbers to I hear anything relating to the heavy stadium rock most other reviewers seem to hear on this. Of course most people reviewing this,even myself likely review it through the listening filters of our own musical tastes anyway. Regardless this is an excellent Simple Minds album,and one thing I can easily agree with the other reviewers on is that its also one of their most fully realized. At least of what little I've heard of them. A worthwhile 80's era album to hear.own musical tastes anyway.

B000WMFZMY|2.0|I really wanted to love EL CID. But somewhere in the ongoing and laborious pomp and circumstance of the Spanish court sequences in the first act it dawned on me that there wasn't much behind the facade. It was watchable, somewhat entertaining, but unfortunately introduced audiences to 1960s Charlton Heston -- while always superb whatever film, whatever scene -- that would see other movies like THE AGONY & THE ECSTASY and MAJOR DUNDEE, far cries from THE TEN COMMANDMENTS and BEN-HUR.<br /><br />There have been comments about the fluctuating sound in the restoration print and rightly so. This may not be entirely the restored version's fault, since the film's director, Anthony Mann, later oversaw a similar bombastic earache, THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. Here, though, everything feels fairly by the numbers when it should have been magnificent, especially in 70mm.<br /><br />Finally, a word on Sophia Loren. Is she miscast? Certainly many would argue her merits to the film, but the misfire may more be in the lack of chemistry between her and Heston. Indeed, a quick scroll thru IMDb trivia for EL CID reveals a strong dislike the two leads harbored for each other. There's a lot of star wattage to go around in big budget epics like these, but something had to give -- and here it was the integral chemistry between the two that needed to carry the emotion of the film. Because it fails, so does this movie.

B009MO5G90|5.0|I'm fan of the Resident Evil saga, so I always expect the next episode very content with the outcome looking forward to the next part.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|After reading this book I am very glad that the whole series is free because I would not be able to read this one and not read the others. I have a feeling that the author was not planning on making a series when he wrote this book and meant it to stand alone.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I love hidden object games and this is another one that did not disappoint me. The makers of the G5 games are probably the best in this category and I love to play them all.
0061992860|5.0|This pocket-sized volume is tremendously helpful for all types of scenarios in the wild.  It is worth its weight in gold, especially if you are an avid hiker/camper/outdoorsman.  It neatly packages tons of useful information into one convenient little book that won't take up too much space in your rucksack or cargo pocket.  Do yourself a favor and pick this up now.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|I bought this movie because I love all of the Harry Potter movies. Me and my brothers and my mom all love harry potter. All of the movies in the series are fantastic. I think everyone should give them a shot.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|High definition gloriousness and adventure you best not miss.  Purchase this for one heck of a time, then write a review and make it rhyme.
B001CQONKY|5.0|This Is one of my favorite shows. CSI is fast hitting and always has a good twist at the end of the season. If you like any of the crime shows you should try this one.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|happy with my last season of dexter and can not wait for final season, just started so i have a while to wait.
B00AEBBA72|5.0|This movie is great. I love Johnny Depp. Johnny is very good in this movie but what movie is he bad in? maybe the rum diary. This movie is one of the good ones. Johnny Depp plays Ichabod Crane he is very good. This is definitely a new spin on a old classic.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Not as action packed as I expected, but still kept me interested and made me laugh at times. I liked the romance part, and the older spy woman kicking butt!
B00129I5SM|5.0|I love all of the Resident Evil Movies. This one is the 3rd in the line. It is a great movie. It has a lot of new stuff in it that the other movies did not have. I have to say this is the last really good one before they started going down hill.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Wonderful book with lots of insights about the healing power of love and how our beliefs create problems for us. Loved it. Recommending to everyone!
B004P7CNUY|4.0|Granted not the best of the halloween franchise but not the worst (halloween 3). I have all of the halloween movies. I love all of them but 3. this one is about jamie lee curtis's character all grown up with a son of here own. This movie is not bad it has llcoolj in it. give it a try.
B002DOSBMK|4.0|This was a fun beginning to a story. A strong and good hero who stands by his values through a corrupt world. He is unlike most Drow who look out only for themselves and the gain of their house. He has feelings and keeps with his morals. Can't wait to read the second.
B004EPZ08O|5.0|This movie is great. I hope this is not a spoiler but it is a prequel. I love all of the Final Destination movies except 4. The 4th movie was horrible. The only thing that made me be able to sit through the whole thing is that i saw it in 3D. It was like the 3rd Halloween movie. It really had nothing to do with the others. This movie redeems the series. It ties everything in 1,2, and 3 all together. If you liked any of the movies I recommend that you give this movie a try!
B006YTTVHO|4.0|I wasn't a where of several things that was brought up in the<br />Book. I guess your never to old to learn something.
B003OF3R0S|5.0|This is a good album. I love Avenged Sevenfold anyway but this is one of there best cds. I think Nightmare is an album you should try.
0375842209|5.0|I'm not a literary genius, but this book is friggin' great. All kids should read this book. A couple friends and I discovered the book when an English teacher Senior year in high school (2010) recommended it to us to read. I got to read it first and I will say I do not regret reading this. The way the book is told from Death's perspective is really, really something and really unique. Buy it! You will not regret it.
1558908498|5.0|I love all of the scream movies. I own all of them and they bring back great memories of my high school days.

B00004UEDQ|5.0|This movie is great! It is one of my favorite movies. When I got the movie in the mail it was not like new like it said. They also did not have a replacement for it. I had to buy the movie from another place. The movie it self was very enjoyable.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love this game, after completing all levels I am going back through to get them right on one try... my only complaint is that there isn't another free version now that i am done with this one.
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|This is the 4th underworld movie. I think all of the underworld movies are all different and all great on there own or as a movie series. All of the Underworld movies have great soundtracks. I will warn Michele lovers He is not really in this movie.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This is my favorite game. I love how it makes me think outside the box and challenge myself. I am so glad they made a mobile version of this game.
B001DJLD1M|5.0|All of the Matrix movies are great! I love most of the movies that Keanu Reeves is in. There are all four movies in this collection. This is a very good buy.

630521610X|5.0|This is the orignal scream. I love all of the scream movies but this is the one they all came from the classic. I love this movie. It has scary parts, funny parts, ironic parts. all in all a great movie.

B0058YPGL6|5.0|I got this show for my brother for Christmas. He loves the show. I have never seen it but he says that it is great.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I've been playing this game for a while now, and it's amazing. If you love iron man, then you'll love the game. Not to mention the superb graphics! Getting new suits (i.e. Iron Patriot or Mark 35,aka the Red Snapper), is the best part because you're motivated to play more to make more stark credits. If you seen the movie, you'll be able to point out some of the scenes where a certain suit were. It's a little hard to get accustomed to when you first play it, but after a while, you'll breeze through it and unlock all armors.(including the Mark 38 aka IGOR!)
B0059WTMLW|5.0|I downloaded this game the other day because it was the app of the day and was free. I figured what is there to lose? Well absolutely nothing! This is a great sudoku game with a LOT of different puzzles for fans of this game. It not only has normal sudoku, but also asterisk, hyper, color, jigsaw, percent, x, and center dot. Definitely plenty to keep you busy! It also has many different levels of difficulty as well starting at very easy all the way to nightmare. Even if it wasn't free, I would have downloaded this anyway.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a great game for those who like acting fast and nice graphics. The only thing I would personally change is less ads.
B00AF6MF9I|2.0|This game is too good to be run so poorly by its developers. Its a good looking fun and addictive social game that has become nearly unplayable. From resetting players hard earned units and medals to the freezing game after a hard fought war to the 3 % loading , no server  connection this game has lost alot of its players and its playability. Too bad such potential to be a great game. fix all the bugs and get a real server and a 4 star game easily.  What a shame.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is so much fun and I love how they add new things and keep it fresh and interesting! Really like it
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|All you people who loved the first one this one is even better because of the new heroes and bosses it is really fun plus it is free.
B0019IB0II|5.0|A fascinating view into how one side of our brain dominates the other, and our lives.<br /><br />What happened to the author was a tragedy but her courage and scientific observation of what she was experiencing and feeling are remarkable and made me think about myself and who &#34;I&#34; am in a new and profound way.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|One of the best puzzles I have played.I was disappointed that the game ended so soon. I can't wait for the next ROOM. I hope it is soon! This would get more stars if it was an option!!!
B004UPALT6|5.0|This is not Shakespeare, it is the Evil Dead 2: essentially a remake of the first Evil Dead indie horror film with something approaching a budget. Big on laughs, this is a standard bearer for the genre.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|In Berkeley recently for a probing interview conducted by Berkeleyside co-founder Frances Dinkelspiel, best-selling novelist Khaled Hosseini spoke about his craft much as any storyteller of our pre-literate past might have done.<br /><br />\\"I just start writing and hope something happens,\\" he said. The interview took place June 23, 2013, before a capacity crowd in the chapel at the capacious First Congregational Church of Berkeley under the auspices of Berkeley Arts & Letters.<br /><br />Hosseini starts with characters he cares about and sets out to tell their stories. \\"You should be really excited about writing when you get up in the morning,\\" he insisted. If he loses interest in the characters, he'll throw out as many as ten chapters and start all over again.<br /><br />\\"I spend years with these characters,\\" Hosseini explained. \\"There's an internal dialogue that goes on\\" as they develop in surprising ways.<br /><br />And the Mountains Echoed began as a \\"linear novel\\" about a young brother and sister, Abdullah and Pari, born in an Afghan village in the late 1940s. However, as Hosseini started to write, he began to wonder how some of the minor characters that had cropped up would fit into the narrative. For example, the children's uncle Nabi \\"became central to the story\\" as the writing proceeded, and Nabi's connection to a Greek doctor working for an NGO in Kabul subsequently took the story to a small Greek island as the doctor, too, emerged as a major character.<br /><br />The result of Hosseini's organic writing process is a novel that is at once intensely personal and broad in scope -- a story that captures a half-century slice of Afghan  history as it relates the lives of Abdullah, Pari, and their family from the peaceful era of the mid-20th Century in Afghanistan to the present day in the South Bay below San Francisco. Compared to Hosseini's previous novels, which verged on tear-jerker melodrama despite (or perhaps because of?) their universal appeal, And the Mountains Echoed is more ambitious, more nuanced, more insightful, and engages Hosseini himself far more.<br /><br />This book firmly establishes Khaled Hosseini as one of the finest novelists working today. He belongs among that handful of post-colonial writers -- including V. S. Naipaul, Chinua Achebe, and Nadine Gordimer -- who were born within cultures unfamiliar to \\"the West\\" and serve as our interpreters of the intercultural experience.<br /><br />Khaled Hosseini, now 48, has lived in the United States since the age of 15, when his family secured political asylum and moved to San Jose. (A Communist coup had just toppled the Afghan King, and Hosseini and his family were fortunate to be living in Paris, where his father was a diplomat.) A physician, Hosseini practiced medicine in the South Bay for a decade until shortly after the runaway success of his first novel, The Kite Runner, persuaded him to turn to full-time writing. Collectively, his three novels -- A Thousand Splendid Suns was the second -- have sold more than 38 million copies.<br /><br />Late in her interview, Dinkelspiel asked the author what plans he had for his next book. \\"I have a few ideas,\\" Hosseini said, \\"but I really won't know what will happen until I sit down at the keyboard.\\"ountains Echoed is more ambitious, more nuanced, more insightful, and engages Hosseini himself far more.<br /><br />This book firmly establishes Khaled Hosseini as one of the finest novelists working today.

B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I doubt one could read The Hunger Games Trilogy carefully without being confronted with the parallels between &#34;The Capitol&#34; and our current-day American self-absorbed preoccupation with the most trivial subjects: fashion, gourmet foods, cosmetics and plastic surgery.  And how the demand for such a lifestyle depletes the resources of the outlying &#34;districts&#34; (colonial countries and states) which seem to exist solely for supplying the Capitol.  I find the writing very strong for this dystopic genre, the action gripping, the emotional ups and downs of the teen characters very believable.
0385736002|5.0|an insane potpurri of al religions and mythologies i expected this to be a flop. the beginning is quite boring but then i just hits you, and for the next 5 books (6 in total) you'll just sail upon it's pages, stopping only to sleep and google the mythological heroes, gods, monsters to make it even greater. an incredible series, challenges you and makes you think!<br /><br />loved it!
B0001V6ZJ8|2.0|I was hoping to be charmed by this old story about the Moulin Rouge.  Sadly, it just didn't hold my interest.
0307949508|4.0|I really liked the book - it's been a while since I read the first one, but it was necessary to remember the first one otherwise you have no idea of what's going on.  I'm going to start the third one which is a direct continuation of this book.  If you think of the trio as one book then it all is great.  This one does not stand alone which is why I gave it only 4 stars.  But I really, really enjoyed it.
1899618740|4.0|Interesting and fun. I wish the overlay, that is moved over the pictures, had a pocket to keep it with the booklet.

0743243153|3.0|The author first defines what is discipline (see note Page 18, the 4 tools of discipline: 1. Delaying of gratification 2. Acceptance of responsibility 3. Dedication to truth 4. Balancing (being able to adapt our instincts to the situation at hand)): what prevents us from embracing discipline is our own laziness.<br /><br />Then he talks about what is love, for him love relies on discipline, what we call 'falling in love' might actually be something else than real love. He then goes on and talks about miracle, grace and serendipity, he has an interesting theory that he links to the evolution on earth (man being the top of this evolution - according to him -) that goes against the flow of the physical law of entropy, then would be moved forward by a godlike being. He gives curious examples as possible manifestations of a godlike entity, for instance the fact that often people are magically protected against harm in a car accident, I have a hard time to follow him on this point, specially because so many people die of car accidents every year, not to mention how many casualties from the 20th century world wars. But as for explaining evil, he comes back to his original idea of the ultimate sin for man: 'sloth' - one of the catholic seven deadly sins - (cf. page 271 \\"Ultimately there is only the one impediment, and that is laziness\\"). Even the original sin is not any more, as I was taught, Eve plucking out fruit out from the Tree of Knowledge, but Eve (and Adam) failing to ask God an explanation of why eating from this tree would have been forbidden (i.e. their own laziness of simply asking). What I find also debatable is the view of the author, who is psychiatrist and therapist, is his idea all along that therapy is an act of love (e.g. Page 176 \\"The job of a parent is to be of use to a child and not to use the child for personal satisfaction. The job of a therapist is to be of use to a patient and not to use the patient to serve therapist's own needs.\\"). Well parents do not get money for loving their children, psychotherapist do for handling their patient, I will add - for the sake of being mean - like one pays to buy 'love' from a prostitute.<br /><br />As for religion, he criticizes Freud for his atheist views but in the same time acknowledge the fact that the Catholic Church is for him the best provider of patients. In my view, he is preaching a little bit too much for his \\"own church\\": psychotherapy
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie. Well acted and filmed. Could have titled this one &#34;Great Balls of Fire&#34;. Wink, Wink.Watch it.
B00847KFDS|5.0|Fogerty did a great job of re-imagining his own material! I wasn't that big on the title track way back when, but the new version with Miranda Lambert really brings it to life. I like every song on this cd. Really love the cajun influence on Proud Mary. Bob Seger on Who'll Stop The Rain. It's all good.
B004NELBPC|5.0|It's nice to have an alternate place to hear another version of what's happening around the Globe. Need more alternative places to hear what other people say and think.
B007KCG7MQ|4.0|It's good to hear new stuff from Joe Walsh. I really like the title track and the rest of the cd is also great to listen to.
B005G4TJUC|4.0|This was a nice add to my collection. The movie is much better the a 2nd installment. Worth buying used.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Ok so I hadn't played minecraft on the pc or xbox when I first started minecraft pocket edition. I had heard awesome reviews, so I got it. It is with way way more than $7.<br /><br />  It is a game where you use your creative skills to create your own WORLD. In the new update they added water bucket, lava bucket, bucket, and spawning animals. All my friends love it. YOU SHOULD BUY THIS GAME.

B001NLKT60|5.0|Another thrilling book with one of the coolest female characters around.  This story delves deep into Lisbeth's past and paints the picture of who she really is.  Can't wait to read the third book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app so much i  play it all the time i would totally recommend it to anyone  it is worth the money
B000YHG72E|5.0|This is a surprising movie. I am not usually a fan of Will Farrell movies, but I really enjoyed the goofiness and the heart. It is definitely silly... not a surprise there.
B0082Z1CVQ|4.0|This is a charming novel I should have read earlier so that I could have discussed it with my mother!  It's a keen look into the historic experience of young women, but speaks beautifully of the idyllic values we wish we could practice every day.  A very good read into a simply kind and wiser world than today.
0545405777|5.0|Is a good history and I can be expected.<br /><br />The characters keep us attentive to what happens.<br /><br />100% Recommended. Good Book.
B00A83075M|5.0|We love Disney movies but I wasn't to sure about one about a video game character.  But this an adorable heartwarming movie and the kids have watched it over and over again.
B0098VXBIA|5.0|Maybe i'm biased because I have a baby and I love her, but I died when I watched this movie. So funny. So cute. So perfect.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is an addictive challenging game that can provide a ton of fun and thinking for anyone of any age.
B0059WTMLW|4.0|It was free, that's about it. Nothing special about the app. It works well on my android tab and has not crashed yet.
B004GJNFHG|3.0|I am the type of person who can watch anything- no matter how dark, twisted or disgusting but this movie really unnerved me. I was expecting to be a viewer but wound up seeing things from the prisoner's perspective. The long, still shots highlighted the isolation of being locked up. In fact, it felt so weird that I actually skipped ahead, then had to go back and see what I had missed. The limited dialogue and grayed out colors added to that feeling of isolation, monotony, and the sensation of being trapped. These scenes were peppered with sudden violence, then an abrupt return to that same nothingness of prison life. Despite being imprisoned, the inmates rebelled in every way they could while maintaining solidarity and commitment to their cause. The actual hunger strike doesn't occur until the end of the movie and is portrayed brilliantly by the lead character. This was a very moving and powerful film but I can't say I liked it any more than I can say I disliked it. It accomplished its goal almost too well and even now, I still have that sense of unrest.
B000002J29|5.0|The only Gensis album I have. It's that good. All their best is on this CD and they did a wonderful concert. Love CD 2 - an hour and only 4 songs. Very well done
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I had fun playing it kept me thinking. I look forward to playing more levels. Definitely on my play list!!!
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|All in all this game is great (since it was free), the only problem I have is I keep getting Facebook has stopped messages constantly, interrupting game play.
B003L77GRO|5.0|awesome brand new!  wasn't expecting it brand new as it was advertised used but in great condition... was brand new what a deal!
B007ZD17XO|5.0|This game is easy to learn and fun to play. I played the casual level and was able to win almost all the levels on the first try. There is an expert level if you want more of a challenge.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This is the second of these I have bought, the first rides in my vehicle emergency kit and this one will go into my survival kit for my kayak.  Light weight and it keeps all blades sharp and ready to use, including serrated one.  Great unit for any type of bush blade.  From belt knives to machete's, to ax's.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|My seven year old loved this demo and gives it five stars.  We had to purchase the Survival Craft game after playing the demo.
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|I don't understand the great reviews... This book dragged on, and on, and on.  Abby and Travis encountered one ridiculous obstacle after another, this jumped the shark multiple times.
B00190KZUU|5.0|Great movie, different! It's a very vivid imaginative film with a great ending ! Would re watch it and recommend it
B00138J234|1.0|It's a great album actually, unfortunately the download failed repeatedly and i have as of yet to be able to get my download...I hate the process not the music. PS: It seems to me that since Amazon started it's affiliation with I-tunes, the download process is unreasonably difficult, fails frequently and I-tunes tries to hijack my computer. Very disappointed Amazon!!!
B0011TQLA2|5.0|Innovative all around.  Within the music, they regenerated their unique sound; and went all the way to re-envisioning the way their music is distributed.  If in doubt, check out: House of Cards music video and the making of [...]
0679721037|5.0|Amazing book.  Once I opened the book I couldn't put it away.  Great journalistic work but reads like a fiction novel.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It is similar to 100 elevators,  but has a few more clues. Frustrating because some events have to happen in sequence, but a good game never the less
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really enjoyed this little game. I can't wait for them to add more rooms. I only rated less than 5 because I would have liked more than 10 rooms to start.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book was an excellent read. The characters are developed well and are easy to identify with. Many authors have attempted to visualize a post-apocalyptic World. Few have done it with as much creativity as Howey.
B0090KZDSK|5.0|wow could not stop reading... wish the book never had to end. it was a good series for sure thanx
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|One of the better of the ones i've seen...disclaimer:  i am not a real 007 fanatic, but it was definitely non-stop action and held my attention.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Very good.  Would recommend to others.  Easy read an very informative.  Also recommend \\"Heaven is for Real\\" also very good book.
B0029EDMEG|4.0|Jesse Stone shows usually involve a violent crime, but it's more the solving of the crime than showing the violence as it happens.
B00847KFDS|3.0|I really wanted to love this album. What with all the collaborations with famous artists I was surprised to find Kid Rock on Born on the Bayou but that is probably the best song on here, Bob Seger was good as well. REALLY wanted to love this album but it just didn't work for me and I love Fogerty. Was hoping for greatness with Tom Morello but it could have been anybody playing. Not one of his better works.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|Always a good time, when you can sit and visit with Elizabeth and her Darcy. One to read again and again.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I am now hooked on this series.  Characters you love, characters you hate and characters you love to hate.  They are all contained in this series.  I highly recommend you read the books before watching the HBO series, however, if you don't you will still enjoy every minute.
030759565X|5.0|I love cookbooks. Let's be honest. But this woman's approach to deliciosity is lots of fun. Why not have fun with food.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|not mussey just a good read.  I enjoy these books so much, I can't wait to read the next one.  Thank you
B0088T3B0G|5.0|I doubt I will ever see another film as well done as this one. It is brilliantly told with an incredibly unexpected conclusion. Although I could live without the &#34;f&#34;'s every ten minutes, the story overcomes even that distraction. Intense and action-packed, this story unfolds twisting and turning until it takes you where you never thought you would go.
0307895475|5.0|LOL this game is awesome, and this book saved me on more than one occasion!! A must have for any fan of the game who has a habit of getting stuck with no way out!
B0094K1WZE|4.0|After 3 movies I thought I would struggle to get through this movie, but the movie kept me entertained and I made through the whole film.  I would never watch these films in the theater but on video it is worth watching.
B00CGPPMKU|1.0|How is this a paid app' it still wants more money to use it to its full potential. Sounds like a ripoff to me.
B00DGN51O8|3.0|The movie was entertaining and the special effect were great. I enjoyed the modern twist at the end of the movie.  I like to be entertained and this movie was good at it.
B00B19DMUE|5.0|We watched this movie 4 times! It was very creepy and scary! It is very worth buying and not just renting!
B00CL66FEQ|1.0|Not good enough to waste any precious evening even though am a big Streisand fan. Borg and very flat humor
1416914285|3.0|I really did not want to read this book. After hearing the controversy surrounding Cassandra Clare and the aftermath of the claims, I was determined not to. But my sister is a fan and has been telling me to read it. Now that the movie's coming out soon, I decided 'What harm could happen if I found it at the library?' I did find CoB at the library, I pushed my thoughts of Ms. Clare to the side and read.<br /><br />Don't say I don't do anything for love.<br /><br />I've read 500-plus page books before, but this truly felt like a chore. Whether it was the flowery prose or the endless characters, places, actions, and descriptions of who is who and who does what and what goes on here and this does that, I was putting the book down frequently to digest everything. Okay, the world is fully fleshed out. That's great. However, the information dumps don't stop. It's enough to make the head spin.<br /><br />Then there are the characters. Clary...oh my, where do I begin? She's not really the protagonist or the main character. She's a casual observer who needs to be saved all the time, then makes dangerous decisions which lead to more saving. There is no personality to her at all. I agree with some of the other reviews where it's stated she's purposely set up this way so readers can imagine themselves in her place. And what is better than having a hot guy \\"flirt\\" with her, have aforementioned hot guy declare his love for her, and then have her male BFF also declare feelings for her. Multiple love interests is a fantasy many girls and guys have. I used to have them myself--used to. All part of the fantasy, still.<br /><br />It saddens me that the trope that if a guy is mean to you, he really likes you, is still used. Tragic past or not, Jace is a jerk who can only manage snarky remarks. And what really makes me sad is that the \\"nice\\" guy is painted as safe, which means boring. What's wrong with nice? Nice does mean boring.<br /><br />And if you are familiar with STAR WARS, the twist won't shock you. I was aware of this twist, but once I started reading it, my anger broke loose. After reading more reviews citing other works which had been reworked into this novel, I am truly dumbfounded.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this book 3 stars is because of the visuals that were created. Which, if I think of it, were probably taken from other works. Now that I've finished this, I can move on to new books, hopefully with more creative ideas.ist won't shock you.

B00BHMF578|5.0|Tight script unpredictable thriller that was well edited clean and just right in terms of length of film. Very good work
006226303X|4.0|I have a strange love/want to like relationship with Neil Gaiman's work. His fantasy novel [[ASIN:B000FC13Y0 Stardust]] had so many beautiful images yet was simply \\"okay\\" for me. His work American Gods still remains unfinished on my bookshelf. Then I picked up his audiobook for [[ASIN:0060530944 The Graveyard Book]], and I finally found a piece of his I absolutely loved. Three really was a charm. If you get the chance to hear his wonderful narration of that book, please do so.<br /><br />This influenced my choice to get the audio version of THE OCEAN AT THE END OF THE LANE, his latest novel--which he narrates with as much enthusiasm as he did with TGB.<br /><br />In this story, a nameless narrator remembers an incident from his past. At its center is a girl as wise as she is mysterious. It's a short work, but it's beautiful in its imagery. Mr. Gaiman manages to create so much with so little. It feels like a fairy tale: there's danger, magic, good and evil. But if you're wondering what is what and who's who, that's left for you to decipher.<br /><br />My favorite character was Lettie. She's crafty, brave, and steadfast. Her world was perilous yet extraordinary. Her claim that the pond by her home is really an ocean may sound crazy, but it feels right. She will stay with me for a long time.<br /><br />I can't say much else because I might get spoilery; however, this is a wonderful work to listen to. It is truly magical, and one I will get lost in many times.
B00BB8SKPW|1.0|Not good enough for Denzel Washington who was completely wasted in a B rated film in my opinion. Had good storyline that could have used better script and screenplay
B008FPOIT6|5.0|This is a fun, quick read. It was recommend by multiple friends and they were right! It could have easily gone the way of a Dan Brown, but thankfully it didn't and stayed original.
B00C1BUYX4|1.0|Not sure what the fuss was All about... I didn't get it and could have cared less for this dark movie with slow complex speech..
