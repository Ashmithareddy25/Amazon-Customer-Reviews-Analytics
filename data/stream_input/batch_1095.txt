B003EY7IRC|5.0|I was worried about how well everything would be explained and ends tied up - not easy to do in a story so complicated! I have to say that Ms Moning has delivered with a BANG! I could not put the book down and when I was finished I had all the answers I wanted. I felt satisfied, content. It is however a conclusion to a tale. Do not read this book as a stand alone if you have not read the other Fever series books. It just will not have the same impact.<br /><br />P.S. Shockingly expensive at $13.79 for the Kindle version!! But I enjoyed the book so much (and it was a longish book) that I am not complaining too much.

0312330871|5.0|And Then There Were None by Agatha Christie is one of the greatest murder mysteries ever written. Putting aside the various updates of racially offensive wording within the pages (including the original title), this story remains a timeless classic.<br /><br />Ten guests are invited to a secluded island vacation home, all under false pretenses. When the island's mysterious host never appears and people begin dying one by one, the remaining guests realize they are caught in a sinister trap.<br /><br />Once you begin reading you won't stop until you discover whodunit.

B002ZG98Z0|3.0|Ricky Gervais had it exactly right: there should be an award for the air-brushing done to the cover photograph for \\"Sex and the City 2.\\" Make that \\"air brushing\\" for the story as well!<br /><br />The first film was about friendships, relationships, and served as a popular way to promote those themes. This time, however, those themes totally get lost in the trashiness of each situation.<br /><br />Spoiler alert: Nothing is as offensive in this movie as the final beach scene when the focus is on Samantha's personal satisfaction which she did not get on the beach in Abu Dhabi. What was denied in Abu Dhabi is allowed in America. Such a scene might be a promotion of freedom here, but it certainly makes Americans look slutty. Not only that, but the focus is totally on Samanths's satisfaction.<br /><br />Sarah Jessica Parker. There simply is no excuse for the empty, vapid life of this aging prima dona. Clothes, clothes, clothes. Oh, good golly, how much does she pay for each outfit? Enough to feed and clothe a dozen poor children in America for how many weeks? And, no, she is not liable to feed them (but I wish she were). Her husband (the handsome Chris Noth, or Big) wants to stay home and not go out every night. Oh, how boring! His dullness makes her want to go to a Middle Eastern country for exotic traipsing.<br /><br />Carrie? You've got a good thing with Big. Life is not a fairy tale. Move on. Accept the little boring moments that inevitably spring up in a long-term relationship and be thankful you have that man who loves you.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I've been with this series since it's start.  I was a bit skeptical to start it because I'd read all the Highland series and saw that the Fever series was a different style of writing.  I'm so very glad I went with my gut and didn't skip this.  Thank you Karen, for letting your fans adore you and for being so involved with us.  You are an amazing writer and couldn't have finished the series better.  Thank you for an invigorating and wild ride with Mac and Yummy Barrons.
B004DIPLMC|5.0|There is little question in my mind that the most glorious music qua music in Wagner's Ring cycle resides in the sumptuous orchestral 'accompaniment'. Indeed, like many I have enjoyed the orchestral portion of the Ring much more than I have the entire theatrical production itself. Others, like Stokowski, have felt the same way; Stoky made a condensed version of the Ring for orchestra alone [[ASIN:B000000WO0 Music From the Ring]]. Loren Maazel did, too, (at the behest of Wieland Wagner no less!) and that's what we get here with Maazel conducting the magnificent Berliner Philharmoniker, a live concert in 2000. (Actually the DVD is taken from TWO live performances from October 17 & 18, 2000.) One big difference between Stokowski's and Maazel's arrangements is that Maazel's is played straight through with no pauses, whereas Stoky's treats each section as complete in itself and with some additional music for endings and the like provided by Stokowski. Maazel has not added a single note of his own. Sometimes this makes for awkward transitions between sections, but this does not in itself ruin the whole. Further, Maazel has provided, in the booklet, a kind of synopsis for each section so that one has an idea of the action as one goes along.<br /><br />Of course Wagner was a genius of the orchestration and there are few orchestras in the world who can do his music as much justice as the Berliner Philharmoniker; their playing is simply marvelous, rich and voluptuous. One is struck, in this neatly filmed DVD, by how young many of the players of the BPO are and how much enjoyment they are getting from their own participation. Of course, by 2000 the orchestra had undergone massive personnel changes. It's amusing, for instance, to see the marvelous principal oboist, Albrecht Mayer, as a practically baby-faced very young man.<br /><br />One could wonder whether having a visual record of what is primarily an auditory experience, namely the performance of an orchestral work, is worth having. I submit that it is. This is an endlessly fascinating experience, or at least it was for me. But best of all, we don't have to deal with all those tiresome singers and all that bothersome stage action. And it only takes 75 minutes to get through the whole Ring!<br /><br />Scott Morrisonth having. I submit that it is. This is an endlessly fascinating experience, or at least it was for me.

B0040QYROK|5.0|A must have for any true aficionado of film.  This is as close to Fritz Lang's vision for Metropolis as we will ever see considering it was made 84 years ago!    For the rest of the population who just like watching movies ;) this is still very worthwhile.  Even though there are no \\"special effects\\" the robot remains an iconic image.  The story is WELL WRITTEN (compared to a lot of the tripe being produced today!) which accounts for a lot.  And it will actually be a BluRay you can be proud to put out on the shelf. LOL    Even the extras are compelling and worth watching.
1594202842|5.0|I just couldn't stopping reading the book until I finished it. Parents must motivate or push kids hard before they can motivate themselves. That was the tiger mom did for her daughters. She might go too far. I suspect she wrote the book this way in order to attract readers and sell books. Everything was 100% true literally in the book? I doubt it. But who cares?  More important, no matter American or Chinese parenting, it is not which one is right or wrong. It is how well it fits your kid. Just imagine that Bill Gates' mom were Chinese, he would not have made Microsoft, although he might be able to go to Harvard. As a parant, you'd better be flexible to change if one seems not working. Maybe the combination of both is the best for most of kids. I have two little ones(2T and 5m). I have time to try something new like that. Like, I am cooking American Chinese food for them. I hope my kids will like it. The bottom line is, however, they must eat it, like it or not.
B003TXKSWK|5.0|Kicks off with 2 killer tracks. From the first beat it makes me smile like I'm watching my favorite movie or a perfect sunset. Slows a bit at times but always dazzles.

B003N7GATM|1.0|Bought this by mistake, thinking it was the Coil release BY THE SAME NAME, originally released decades earlier. Needless to say, the instant I saw Trend Reznor in the liner notes, I gave it to a pop music fan rather than keep it. I would have returned it if possible. Seriously, it was bad enough that Down in It is the same basic track as Dig It by Skinny Puppy, but this is an even more blatant rip off which, though only in name, is sure to have his former mentor, the now deceased Sleazy of Coil and TG fame, rolling in his grave.

0385341679|5.0|How many times have we read a review and wondered \\"Was I reading the same book they were?\\"  Because while they wax rhapsodic over the beautifully written prose, you're struggling with the poor editing, unbelievable plot points and the multiple holes.  (or you loved it, they hated it) This is especially true with a series. You want resolution for that secondary character you've come to love. Or there's a question since book one that's been burning a hole in your psyche that never gets answered to your satisfaction.    So, for me? It gave me the resolutions I wanted, but holyguacamole did it drag me through Hades to get me there.  There is A LOT of angst in here. Not just peeks but guided tours through some seriously tortured psyches.  KMM really put her characters through the ringer not only in this series but in this book.  The Who? What? Where? How and Why?? were so tangled and intertwined that I do have one cautionary note, read it on Kindle at your own risk.   I had to do a lot of jumping back to clarify some going's on. It would have been easier with a book.  There was also too much extraneous (read tedious) information that didn't matter in the story that I can only assume (hope) will tie in somewhere down the line in another book    My main complaint with the first book in the series was the annoying amount of descriptive detail that's used to describe how pretty, arrogant and shallow Mac is when she arrives in Dublin (she's completely unlikable IMO)   But over the series the world KMM has created chews her up, spits her out, leaves her for dead, pushes her to the limits, and forces her to ask herself over and over.  How bad do you want to live? Want to win? How bad do you want answers and vengeance and what price will you pay to get it, what will you sacrifice?  And most importantly, what won't you?  And just when you're sure what she's going to do...well you'll have to read it to find out.  From beginning to end, this was Mac's journey, and unlike some protagonists, her voice was clear.   Was she a Mary Sue? Over the course of the series yeah, she had quite a few Mary Sue moments.   But you got the feeling KMM knew it, and poked the title with a stick. Too many authors who make the Mary Sue take it so seriously.   Mac had more of a \\"I'm speshul?..BFD..no seriously stop with the speshul already, well ok that speshul is cool, but no more..really. I'm speshul enough now. STOP\\"       And hopefully without giving too much away - the love story buried under this whole thing was amazingly poignant. The raw feelings between them, the layers of emotion and sacrifice? By the time they reach their HEA, you know nothing else would have been acceptable.

1594202842|5.0|I recommend this book to learn from her mistakes and learn what it takes for all these child prodigies to become professional musicians, athletes, artists, etc.  All children in hard core music/athletic circles live like this.  I see ordinary American coach/parents yelling and screaming at their children at baseball games, gymnastics etc., in hopes to make them recipients of college scholarships...even when it is evident their kids have no talent or possibilities. Isn't this child abuse?  The kids in sports are crying all the time.  At least Amy's children did succeed and have talent.

B0042FZWC0|4.0|This book is basically a collection of Chris' blog posts, but the fact you can have them organized for you is a plus. I felt very motivated after reading this, and if that was all I got, it was worth the $8 I spent. I had a friend who read this not too long after me, and he also felt a kick in the rear. The ideas in this book may not be practical or feasible for all. Not everyone can will travel all over the world, but whatever your \\"it\\" may be, Chris shows you that you can get there. You don't have to follow the cookie-cutter style of life most of us Americans lead in their education and occupation. Chris' thoughts provide a bit of a challenge to get out and make the changes you want to see in the world.

I had just started reading [[ASIN:1400064287 Made to Stick: Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die]]and was able to get an advance copy of this. I devoured both books. This was slightly more impactful to me, because like most people, I am always looking to improve or change something about myself. The perspective of the elephant and the rider really clicked with me. With some of the ideas from this book I was able to quit a few bad habits as well as pick up a few good ones. The Heath Brothers nailed it again!
1439133948|3.0|Well, knock me over, I've finally discovered a Bujold book that didn't totally enthrall me.  In fact, it took me nearly 75 pages before I became at-all involved in the storyline.<br /><br />The problem for me was that while the political and economic commentary was fun and funny, that the characters weren't all that engrossing.  In fact, I continued reading more to enjoy LMB's writing than to discover what shenanigan's the corporations were up to, or how Miles and Roic and Raven made out.<br /><br />By the way, this isn't a book that would stand alone well, in my opinion.  Lots of back-story references.

1577314808|2.0|Before I read this book, I had an unusual experience. After a night full of the world's worst nightmares, I woke up, and to my astonishment, I was floating in the air over my bed, and every detail in the room glimmered with a magical light. I saw  stars on the walls. Everything smelled  wonderful. My cat suddenly had gold-teeth and eye pupils of diamonds. My  hair had turned into silk. I heard angelic music playing through the window. I decided to go outside.<br /><br />I then walked out over red cashmere carpets now covering the sidewalks that used to be faint and unsanitary. I walked to the neighborhood park. The grass was now gold colored. I sat down on a park bench whose mundane wood material had turned into a heavenly mahogany. I did not work or eat for 2 years, as I sat and admired the shiny diamonds in the pigeons eyes, and the wonderful music, reminding  of Slayer's Raining Blood.<br /><br />I had found my \\"being\\". I felt liberated.<br /><br />I finally decided to fly home, as now had developed wings of beauty never seen on earth. I could reach the speed of light without problem.<br /><br />That's how my own journey started. Food and sleep have become optional. I do no longer even depend on oxygen for survival.<br /><br />-Eckart Trolle
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Highly recommend this book. As many have stated, could not put it down once started. Very gripping and entrancing. Great book to discuss with friends after reading due to the many issues that are brought up in this book.
B000XUFPJS|5.0|First of all, Fernando and BHALL both have great in depth reviews of this album, so check out their reviews for the full story.  This is my first Baroness album and I am totally blown away!  This is a great album for those who love the technical proficeincy of Metal and the creativity of pyschedelic rock (Mastodon fans).  The thing that has gripped me the most is how unpredictable the songs are.  For many bands you can tell how the entire song will progress after the first 45 seconds of the song.  Not with Baroness!  I think  I had a permanent grin during my first listen as the sound scapes continually changed throughout the album. Baroness are really carving out their own sound and it's a beautiful thing to behold. If you enjoy exciting and creative rock/metal I highly recommend this album.
B0034G4P7Q|3.0|i've been a fan of david fincher for years, along with trent reznor and justin timberlake<br />and although this is a perfectly good film, i think they took the cheap way out by distorting reality to make it seem more compelling<br />there could have been more creative ways to do so besides mis representing zuck<br />and by no means is this a film worthy of receiving an award for best picture - especially in the same year as inception
0739366416|3.0|This purchase was originally an action of my curiosity, in that I had heard so much publicity about this book,(most critical) I was just really curious to read what it actually did say.  I believe we should know what all is entailed, have a thorough knowledge on a topic, before we begin speaking about something. Being interested in politics, I felt this was \\"important\\" in my reading selection list. I haven't gotten through the entire listening but thus far I'm finding it most interesting.
1416550550|4.0|The Forgotten Garden was a great historical mystery read. After her grandmother passes away, Cassandra is given the task of following leads that her grandmother had found 30 years ago while trying to figure out who she was. The story is a bit long-winded, but well worth it in the end once the truth is revealed. The Distant Hours by Kate Morton is next on my list.
B004G6009U|5.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said by the other well-written reviews? Probably nothing, but I felt I should say something anyways (and perhaps to prove Disney wrong about young girls not liking fairy tales anymore). I won't repeat the movie synopsis; others have done it already, and better than I could. It's almost impossible to think of enough adjectives to describe this fantastic movie. Let's start with the animation: it is, without a doubt, the most realistic animated movie I have EVER seen. Some shots (especially of people from the back) looked so real I thought the movie had switched to live-action. I didn't see it in 3D, but I didn't have to to be impressed with the very well-executed animation (no wonder this is the second most-expensive movie ever made).     Next, we have Rapunzel herself. I think something I really liked about this movie is how she was portrayed. She's not the typical female you usually see in movies nowadays. She's not the Angelina Jolie action-packed I-can-do-anything-and-don't-you-say-different; she's unsure, somewhat shy, and innocent as a lamb. Yet these qualities are not brought across as something to look down upon, which many movie companies would have you believe. She doesn't flirt once with Flynn (or Eugene, if you prefer), which is unbelievably refreshing.    Then there's Flynn Rider. I just love how he was transformed over the course of the movie. In the beginning, he's a selfish, snarky thief who cares only about himself. As the show goes on, Rapunzel slowly (and quite unintentionally) changes him. By the end of the film, he's learned to care about someone else, to the point where he's willing to put his own life on the line to protect her. The change is gradual enough that it's made fairly believable, so don't be sitting there thinking, \\"Oh brother, how unlikely is that?\\"    And of course, we can't forget Maximus and Pascal. As someone else said, the horse really steals the show. Every time he was on the screen, I ended up laughing. His quick, jerking movements and facial expressions evoked laughter from our audience every time. Pascal is funny as well, with lots of sly looks and a bit of attitude.    I agree with others who have said the music isn't as knock-out as some of the songs from the Disney Renassaince. But they're not terrible, either. I actually found myself humming \\"I've Got a Dream\\" the other day. And \\"I See the Light,\\" when coupled with the beautiful floating lantern scene, could almost bring tears to one's eyes.    \\"Tangled\\" is the perfect blend of plot, laughter, and just down-to-earth good-old-fashioned Disney magic. They really out did themselves on this one; I know it's going to be a favorite of mine for years to come.
B004IM14RY|4.0|Umm well I I don't wanna spoil the ending but.....I wouldn't recomend this movie to anyone. Ever....the movie is good but the story is tragic....no one wants to see this....its just plain depressing.
B0049OSQ18|5.0|\\"The King Is Dead\\" is excellent new music by the Decemberists. My favorite tracks are \\"January Hymn\\" and \\"June Hymn\\". Colin Meloy's vocals are very pleasant to listen to.  These two songs are truly a celebration of the winter and summer seasons.  My other favorite track is \\"This Is Why We Fight\\".  This song is about the fight for freedom and justice.  John Moen provides a good  beat on the drums on this track.  \\"Down By The Water\\" is a song that features a singer named Gillian Welch.  I like Colin's harmonica playing on this track very much.  \\"Calamity Song\\" is an upbeat track with a spirtual quality.  The guitar playing is worthy of note here. \\"Rox In The Box\\" is a track that features band member Jenny Conlee playing the accordion.  I like the happy tone she creates with her instrument here.  \\"Dear Avery\\" is a slower song in tempo.  This song is a song about missing a special friend.  \\"Don't Carry It All\\" is a reminder that people need to work together to ease each other's burden at times.  \\"Rise To Me\\" is a song about some things can take a person's breath away.  This is a very pretty song. The Decemberists will make more people fans of folk music with this album. I enjoy it very much.

0345441184|3.0|It took me about one third of the book before I became hooked on the story. Lots of preliminary stuff to get through-- the foundation for the real story had to be laid, with the plot finally taking off about halfway through.     The basic story is very good, with the women of Arthur's wide circle taking center stage. I especially liked the conflict between the \\"pagans\\" and the Christians; I suspect that part had some basis in history. Provided some interesting discussion at book club about whether we all really worship the same deity, just using different names for the deity.     The biggest problem I had with the book was it was heavily overwritten; too much repetition, too much expository writing \\"inside the character's head.\\" It got to the point that it seemed like some characters were doing/thinking things that didn't jive with what they had done/thought previously. One scene with Morguase veered way off what I thought she was capable of and didn't add anything material to the plot. Characters sometimes seemed to flip-flop on their opinions. Like I said, needed better editing, in my opinion. But for those who just can't get enough of Camelot, it will probably be an enjoyable book.
B0049OSQ18|2.0|How the mighty have fallen.  I started listening to The Decemberists when The Crane Wife came out and immediately dove into their back catalog, enjoying Picaresque, Castaways/Cutouts, and The Tain dozens of times. (Her Majesty was good, but not my favorite.)    This newest album is the most disappointing and unremarkable Decemberists album yet.  While the lyrics retain some of the complexity that you'd expect from the band, the music itself sounds like average folksy/country rock.  There wasn't a single track that arrested me like \\"The Island\\" or \\"The Infanta\\" or \\"The Mariner's Revenge Song\\"  The most any song on this album did was elicit some tapping feet.    If you buy this expecting some refreshing and interesting music, you'll be disappointed.  It's formulaic and, for lack of a better word, \\"boring.\\"

B0018AT7M8|2.0|I've been a Rush fan for many years and am biased to like anything they do. This CD, however, is unlistenable and a huge disappointment. The crowd noise throughout overpowers the music. I give it two stars only because the set list is great.    If you enjoy listening to live music on a subway platform with a train approaching, or if you think the problem with most live records is that it's too damn easy to hear the musicians, you might enjoy the acoustics of this release. Otherwise, you will indeed be disappointed -- despite your best intentions to convince yourself otherwise.

1935251740|3.0|On the plus side: Quantum physics reveals some very strange things about the very basic nature of `reality'. I think it was Niels Bohr who said something like \\"if quantum theory doesn't shock you, you haven't understood it\\". This book does a very good job of explaining some of these strange results, including detailed descriptions of the experiments used to confirm the `shocking' theoretical propositions. The book is also very interesting early on when the authors discuss the limits of science. The book is worth buying on these fronts alone.    However, I only gave the book 3 stars because of it has shortcomings. First, I couldn't quite follow some of the logical leaps the authors made. For example, one of the early critical foundational arguments is that a tree falling in the forest doesn't make a sound if no one is there because the tree only makes vibrations in the air, but sound is a cognition so if nobody is there, there is no `sound'.  I wasn't very convinced by this argument, nor by many of the other segues into the 7 principles of Biocentrism. I think they also stretch quantum physics a bit too far at times. Thus, in the end, the book failed to convince me of its central argument (which, despite the authors' claims, seemed a trite bit `new-agey' to me).    Overall, there is some merit to the book, and I would give it a higher recommendation if the authors cut its length in half by getting to the point quicker and cutting out some of the protracted stories about personal experiences.

0786868724|5.0|I was read about the rev henry covington had pass, I wanted to know who he was it was something about this man of God. When I found out mitch albom had wrote a book on rev covington and his friendship I had to read have a little faith, to see how God work into these to men life's was so good and how they became good friend's and the different in there faith's a trouble man that went to God to save his life, and the other one who and unusual request was ask of them. This was a good read now I know about my brothers keeper.
B002NF1ZI6|5.0|My 9 year old son is the fourth boy in the family and has inherited massive amounts of Legos, most of which were already assembled. He's his own guy and disassembled them and now has a big bin full. I like to build things with him and noticed that he makes structures but didn't have the pieces to complete his creations. I don't know who was more excited to open this toy on Christmas, he or I. Some kids go for the structure of having a kit and instructions. Others, like my son are free building spirits and are happier with their own creations. So for the structure kind of kid, this would be good for them to experiment with their creativy and for the latter type it's a builder's bonanza! One last word of advice - make sure you have a baseplate to build upon.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|I received my DVD series about a week after ordering. I found them all to be in immaculate condition! Thank you for the awesome price and service! This was my very first purchase from Amazon and a very good experience :)
B002E5RZHK|4.0|A wonderful cookbook. I have not made any recipes yet but I am looking forward to try some.  Some of the recipes look very time consuming.
0792839730|5.0|A very powerful film, realistic and gritty, it tells the story of Operation Market Garden when the Allied forces try to knock the Third Reich out of the war with one blow.  The idea is simple - grab a bunch of bridges in Holland, using airborne units, which would then be linked up by a massive ground assult.  The result would be a pathway right into the heartland of Germany, straight into their factories and workshops.  The real result was more casualties for the Allies than suffered during the D-Day invasion.<br />It is a great movie, full of drama, humor, and movie stars.  Gene Hackman, James Caan, Sean Connery, Robert Redford, and Michael Caine to name a few.  It was based on the book, A Bridge Too Far, but I am not sure how authentic it is to the facts.  But it is a must see, right up there with such films as [[ASIN:B000EHSVSC Tora! Tora! Tora! (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]], [[ASIN:B000EHSVS2 Patton (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]], and [[ASIN:B000EHSVRS The Longest Day (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]].
B00005ASGG|5.0|I am a fan of realistic westerns that let you identify with the Old West and the lives of the people who stuggled to make it their home.  This is one of those.     In many westerns the story line doesn't ring true or seem plausible. The setting, props, etc. are not reflective of the time line of the story.    This is one of the few movies that sets the standard for western movies. Others would include High Noon, The Searchers, and the original Monte Walsh.  Lonesome Dove comes close.    A great story, whether set in the West or not.
B0044430H8|5.0|Soundtracks are not something I think of when I consider great music. They are monotonous, dull, and do what they are told, be background music. But this my friends, this is the start of something wonderful. Not even Daft Punk could make a soundtrack worth buying, but Mr. Reznor and Mr. Ross sure did. This is music at it's finest, and I would be bold enough to say this is one of the best albums of the year. If it doesn't win best score at the Oscars, someone deserves to be shot.
B0042AEOG0|4.0|My mom loved Mariah's last christmas CD so I decided to get her this one as well. It was a great idea. She was so excited and played it all Christmas Day. When I pushed the excitement aside to really evaluate the CD, I found it to be ok for Mariah-- not amazing. She really made the perfect Christmas CD the last time around. I give this CD 4 stars because even when Mariah makes a mediocre Christmas CD by her standards, she is still better than most of the pop act's out there who try to do the same. It's worth a listen.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I really like the point of view from which this book is written.  It's a powerful, but disturbing story.  I am currently online looking for more like this.  This story reads like a nonfiction account of a real event.  I was drawn into this book and couldn't put it down from the first paragraph.  Great read!
B00338QENI|5.0|This was superbly written!  When a book has the magic, intrigue and storyline of fiction, but is actually nonfiction, it's a masterpiece.  Or at least Rebecca Skloot's version is.  I was as glued to this as I am a phenomenal fiction book, and for a nonfiction book based on science, that's pure magic.  She's an incredibly gifted writer, and I'm glad my book club finally read this after I'd eyed it for a few months.  So compelling and full of emotion.      If I could voice any criticism, some of the sections related to Ms. Lacks extended family were a bit dull and didn't add much to the story.  Still, a great read and one that I recommend highly!
B0042U94UQ|4.0|I watch this movie with my nephew while he was visiting for the holidays, and it was so funny it is quite a family movie.

0312370830|5.0|This was a fantastic book. I could not put it down. It makes you realize how lucky we are today and helps us to remember and never forget what happend during World War II.
B002ZG981E|4.0|If you can figure out the plot of \\"Inception\\" and follow through its excruciating steps, you deserve a tee shirt prize. People are put in various dream states and strata or levels of dream conditions. One is Limbo, and in one dream state you can never get out and can be trapped there forever. One person's subconscious directs another person who may be the architect of the dream world or the inceptor. Sound like a lot of gobbledegook? Well, it may well be.<br />Leonardo Di Caprio is the lead inceptor, but he is a poor one, because he's too wrapped up in his wife's death, a death he may have caused by putting her in a dream state in which she killed herself. An elevator in a dream takes him down to a beach site, and his reality dreaming conflicts with the mission he is supposed to be conducting. He keeps seeing his dead wife over and over. Get it?<br />There's a lot of action, a great deal of destruction of buildings and street scenes created by computer enhanced technology, something we're getting way too much of in movies these days.<br />Michael Caine has a cameo role in the film. Di Caprio assembles a team to go with him on his dream missions. It reminds me of other team movies like Munich or Mission Impossible or Topkapi. A leading member of the teams is Eames, a very athletic guy, actor Tom Hardy, who is able to defy gravity and walk up walls and on ceilings. Di Caprio is this sci-fi action thriller is a crook who doesn't steal objects; he steals ideas from people's minds and dreams.<br />It's an interesting premise, but the producers should practice the principle of KISS which is Keep it Simple, Stupid, so moviegoers can more readily follow this type of dream creation. Di Caprio is very earnest in it, but I'm not sure he has figured out the plot either.<br />There are interesting visuals, some good special effects, some unique dream sequences, and good cinematography. It's a tricky subject but one which can be conveyed better through movies than in any other medium.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I had no idea how the author was going to wrap up all the loose ends that had been left in the first four books. All I can say, it was beautifully written and had more twists and turns than I could keep up with. I couldn't get enough and can't wait to share this book with others!
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I have really enjoyed both of her seriers, this last in the Shadow Fever Series was not disappointing!  I would highly recommend it.  It is edgy, dark, hopeful, and engrossing. I couldn't put it down.
B000PC0U1W|4.0|I feel this movie went beyond what movies in it's genre did for the time it came out. You had a good run on very awsome movies that came out in the couple of years before and after this one. I feel that is well written and dirtected. as well as devolvped.
B004HAG40O|5.0|Well I love it. Right up my alley. Decemberists with some alt-country influence from 2010 touring with Gilliam Welch.  You can pick up hints of Tom Petty riffs, gobs of REM fruit, a little melancholy Springsteen on the nose, notes of Knopler storytelling on the back palette. Drink now, but will only benefit from cellaring.
B000002GAF|5.0|Having been a Gino Vanelli listener since the mid 70's, I think that Brother To Brother has to ranked with the best work that Gino has done if not as the best.I own Gist Of The Gemini,Black Cars, & Powerful People also, so I'm not a casual Gino fan.To me his music covers a lot of different genres rock,jazz,some R/B.Having said that,when you put this on and listen to Apoloosa & The River Must Flow,then realize that this is a CD that you just cant stop listening to after the 1st two cuts,you know you're listening to something very special.I probably sound like a broken record, but Amazon deserves a lot of credit for making music like this available for the prices that they do.THANKS AMAZON!!!!!
B003R0LBVW|1.0|Don't waste your time or money.  If this is what makes a classic american novel nowadays, it shows how low class, unintelligent, and shallow we have become.  I think that's the point of the book, but Franzen doesn't make that point very well.
B001E75QH0|4.0|I'll reserve judgment on the films themselves... I bought this for the kid, who loves them all (even the fourth one), and he's very happy to have them.    I was skeptical of the quality of the DVDs considering the reasonable price, but found the packaging and picture quality to be quite adequate. Kingdom of the Crystal Skull comes as the 2-disc special edition, which is a nice touch. However, we are somewhat reliant on closed captioning and the implementation here is awful. Only about every other line shows up in text, which is distracting and makes the dialogue hard to follow. All four DVDs suffer from this flaw. I've only knocked one star off for it since most people would not be using this feature, but for us it was a big disappointment.
B003S897U0|5.0|When I first truly heard and listened to the Black Crowes two and a half years ago, I couldn't express my excitement.  'This,' I thought, 'is American rock and roll.'  I bought their albums, learned their songs, and felt their meaning.  They'd become, like so many other groups, a part of my life.    At the same time I heard the group was going on an indefinite hiatus, I learned of a revamped greatest hits album that was soon to be released.  Finally, I bought it for my mother to get her interested.  We listen to it together sometimes.  To her, it's an introduction to one of the finest American rock and roll bands in existence, and to me, it's a testament to all the fine work that they've done, and still put out.    You won't regret this purchase.
B000HWZ61Y|5.0|Wow, what can I say.  The original release was so far ahead of its time in production quality that it remains relevant today, so I really had high expectations with the remastered tracks.  Anyone who has spent time listening to the layers and complexity that always seem to provide new discoveries on the original knows what I'm talking about.  If not get yourself a pair of headphones and check out the spatial depth on any one of these tracks, although I am partial to \\"Love Bites\\".    I've always wondered about the exchanges with the musicians and producers while recording, something along the lines of (insert British accent here) \\"Ok, so you want me to record this one chord just one strum, and it only goes on the 17th bar and nowhere else?  And I just did three just like it but at different octaves...I'm starting to see why we're 3 million over budget.\\"  But it's that obsessive attention to detail that is the equivalent to a master artist under-painting his canvas.    If you have the 1986 original on CD or in MP3 format, do yourself a favor and spring for the deluxe.  And when you import it to iTunes what have you spring for the higher sampling as well.  While you're at it notice how fast your computer samples the studio tracks, like a knife through hot butter!  If you are an audiophile I'm preaching to the choir.  However (and this is the beauty of this CD) if you are not doing so might just make you become one.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|It would be no big deal to put the original versions in this set. I have no problem with them cleaning up the prints, fixing some bad mattes, or adding color. But don't mess with the edit!  The pacing of the first movie was EPIC and speedy. The added scenes and special effects take AWAY from the movie.  I will buy a blu-ray player when Mr. Lucas decides to give us the originals.  In other words, I won't be buying these or a blu-ray player anytime soon.

B000005KQT|5.0|If you love harmonica blues, you must have this collection.  Many of the early and best blues bands used Little Walter's harmonica - because he was one of the very best there ever was.  He died way too early and tragically after a street fight.  Blues music lost a lot...which is ironically essential to its essence.  Buy this.
B0026GGCMG|4.0|Why does this (absolutely terrific) album cost $9.99 to download, when you can individually download each of the six tracks at $.99 each? What am I missing?
B003G4W49C|5.0|I loved this book.  I looked ahead though, and decided I didn't like the direction the story takes in the subsequent books, so I decided I would not read them.  This author is an amazing story teller.
B003YOMNCM|5.0|I am still getting used to the Higdon piece, but Hahn's playing throughout is as precise and burnished her brand would lead you to expect.  Hilary Hahn fans need not hesitate.
B000MXMS4G|5.0|What is there to say? This album is a classic, and even today these songs are as relevant and enjoyable as ever. Maybe some of the best group vocals in music history? The harmonies are still as mesmerizing as they were in '77.
B0049VGTGA|5.0|Genesis singer and drummer Phil Collins' first proper solo album Face Value was released in February of 1981.<br />Phil was the last member of Genesis to do a proper solo album (the Brand X albums were not real solo albums but an outside project for Phil when Genesis was not recording). When Face Value hit the streets, people were in awe over the excellent production, Phil co-produced with Hugh Padgham, and engineering of Hugh Padgham and listeners were immediately aware that this album was a collection of letters to his first wife whom left him during Genesis' And Then There Were Three Tour in 1978 and would divorce in 1979.<br />Also, the Face Value album has a collage of musical styles (running the gamut from Genesis' atmospheric music to Motown to jazz to funk to soft rock to regular rock to art rock).<br />The opening US Top 20 hit (which was the second single here in the States from the album) \\"In the Air Tonight\\" was a classic that used the metaphor of a drowning man as the demise of the divorce of his first marriage. The track, like all the others features Phil's superb vocals and drumming but also showed he could play keyboards and write great songs. He wrote ten of the album's twelve tracks himself. Also, Genesis touring guitarist/bass player Daryl Steurmer's guitar here is phenomenal. \\"I Missed Again\\" was the album's other US Top 20 hit (and was the first US single) and is another highlight featuring the Earth Wind and Fire horn section and famed British sax player Ronnie Scott giving this track a Motown feel. \\"This Must Be Love\\" is an optimistic song about Phil rebounding from the demise of his first marriage to find peace with a new love in his life (whom would be his second wife Jill). \\"The Roof is Leaking\\" is a great country blues number with some killer slide guitar from Joe Partridge (interesting that Eric Clapton did play on an earlier take with the dobro but was scrapped) and banjo from Daryl.<br />The two instrumentals \\"Droned\\" and \\"Hand in Hand\\" are superb as well (the latter is his most well known instrumental). My favorite track on the album is the ballad \\"If Leaving Me is Easy\\" which is a very sad song and will bring a tear to your eye after listening to the lyrics and the melody and orchestrations on the track. If this doesn't do the trick then you either are insensitive or a robot.<br />The Genesis track \\"Behind the Lines\\" was re-done as a disco/funk tune after Phil played the original recording back at double speed during the Duke sessions in 1979 and a new version was born complete with horns. His cover of The Beatles' \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" (the album's closer) is the best cover version of the song I ever heard and a great album closer. He slowed the tempo down and made this song as it was his own. Ironically, the track turned into a tribute to John Lennon who passed away two months before this album was released. Then this is Phil's only album with a hidden track of him singing \\"Over the Rainbow\\" at the tail end of \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\".<br />The other tracks the sweet piano/orchestra ballad \\"You Know What I Mean\\", \\"Thunder and Lightning\\" and \\"I'm Not Moving\\" (with Phil on all instruments save John Giblin's bass guitar) are great songs as well but people overlook these.<br />When released, the Face Value album shot straight to #7 here in the US (outcharting every previous Genesis related release up to that point) and sold four million copies (which was more than any Genesis album up to that point) here in the United States alone.<br />I first discovered this album when my dad had the cassette when I was a child. Then, in late August of 1997 I bought the CD and played this album constantly and was the soundtrack to the fall semester of college for me that year.<br />In 1994, Atlantic Records released a limited run Gold CD of this album which is now LONG OUT OF PRINT. For those who want a Gold CD of this album, I recommend you buying this. The mastering on this new CD is much superior to the original 1980s CD issue. Most re-issues out now of albums are compressed to sound appealing to the MP3/iPod loving sheep (which I do not apply as I don't own either an MP3 player nor an iPod). If people are waiting for a \\"COMPRESSED TO HELL\\" remaster will have to keep on waiting but those who want a Gold CD issue with excellent sonic quality and also all the original artwork (save for the gatefold pictures but does have photos of original vinyl LP Atlantic labels) and with lyrics and some misspellings of credits fixed, go for it!<br />Highly recommended!t now of albums are compressed to sound appealing to the MP3/iPod loving sheep (which I do not apply as I don't own either an MP3 player nor an iPod).

B0009P5YXO|5.0|I purchased this toy for my friend for Christmas because he is a Dr. Who fan just like me. He loves it!!! I love it too, but wish I bought myself one. It came in excellent condition and it is durable.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|This is a great movie. It has some small scenes of humorous violence but besides that it has a nice story.
B0001XAPY2|3.0|I appreciated the clarity and authenticity of the political atmosphere, the masculinity of Porco and his relationship with the girl. The movie has solid production, but I often found myself wondering where it was going. In the end I discovered it wasn't really going anywhere.    Heroes in movies need to grow. There's not a lot of growth or introspection on the part of Porco. He is who is is, he's surprised a bit by the young girl's talent, and there's little else.    The Girl Who Leapt through Time, in contrast, presents a lot of lessons for the protaganist. There is a definite journey with trials that lead to a wiser and richer character. That metamorphosis is lacking in Porco.
B002KKBV8I|5.0|This may be the best toy ever.     The parts are well made. The box is pretty small, but when I started working with them, there were plenty to have fun with. The magnets are strong enough to make structures, but you have to build the structure carefully, so it is well braced.    This size set gives you plenty to get started with, but you will need more to satisfy your craving for larger structures. There are some videos on YouTube which are great, but have monstrous size sets.     I suppose that when my 6 year old granddaughter comes over, I will let her play with them...
B000001GQB|5.0|Mozart's late symphonies are some of the finest ever. From the classical period, Nos. 35-41 were composed in the 1780s. The 41st is the last symphony Mozart wrote. This is a great recording by Karl Bohm and the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra.
B003Y5H4SO|5.0|I loved this movie, it was really different and keep me interested.  You are trying to figure it out through the whole movie, who might the devil be? But I am a serious horror fan of thriller and mystery horror, not gore horror and this was one of the best I have every seen.  I was glad to purchase this after waiting until it got on DVD, it was well structure and the acting was believeable.  Very good movie.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I took a day or two to settle after finishing this book to write a review. I had anticipated it for so long and made so many hypothesis about the ending that I needed to see if my own personal hype had colored the experience of reading the real ending. I must say that it was a wonderful ride! Some of my hunches were correct, some a bit off the mark, many surprises and the plot twisted and turned and definitely kept my attention. It was a definite page turner as I find all Ms. Moning's books to be.  I will definitely re-read it because there were so many stories to wrap up this book was just jammed pack with information. It was also a sort of mini reunion of many characters from the Highlander series and little flashback reviews of some of the most memorable Barrons/Mac moments. I loved getting more insight into \\"Barrons Men\\" but I suspect from the fact that we never really find out what they are and without writing spoilers, I think that there is a lot of story left to develop in the future.
0061777250|5.0|There is nobody as superstitious as a scientist. They know what they want to prove and they reject anything to the contrary. They believe that consciousness is a result of brain activity, i.e. chemical and electric events in the brain. There is absolutely no evidence of this, but they believe it anyway because they want to. When you believe in things you don't understand then you suffer from superstition.<br /><br />Consciousness is not a result of brain activity. Someone who is brain dead can still be conscious. Someone who is dead as a door knob can still be conscious. Read the book.<br /><br />Your soul is immortal. It temporarily is joined to your body. When your body dies, your soul is set free of it.

B0006ZFQNA|5.0|Carmen is one of the most famous operas ever. By Georges Bizet, it was first performed in 1875. The Hanbanera and The Toreador Song are very popular arias. The overture is also very famous. This recording has great singing and music, with Claudio Abbado and the London Symphony Orchestra. After hearing Carmen, you will be an opera fan forever. It is one of my favorite operas of all time.

B0030E1XJU|4.0|I ordered this toy just because my son asked for something from Toy Story and it turned out to be a better gift then just a last mintue thought. My neice, who is 16, and my nephew, who is 13, have both grown out of the toy stage...so I thought, until they saw the stunt set, that is. They played with both sets none stop Christmas morning. My sister came in the room and said,\\"Who Knew!?!?\\". She could have saved money by buying them toys instead of all the electronic nicks and nacks they were ignoring to play with my son's toys. Great Gift!
1563894696|1.0|I honestly can't imagine how this tripe can be so popular and positively reviewed.  If this were a novel, any reader with common sense would find it hackneyed and obvious.  I can spot at least three films that Loeb steals directly from (although kinder reviews call it an \\"homage\\" to The Godfather) and the \\"mystery\\" is simply a cobbling of confusing scenes with the occasional murder and two or three clearly red herrings.  The reveal at the end could have been picked with a dartboard.  Not unlike \\"HUSH,\\" Loeb infrequently references a seemingly innocuous character throughout the story and then, suddenly, in the last few panels of the last issue, shoehorns motivation and malevolence into said character to explain why they are the antagonist.  There are no clues throughout the story to indicate the killer nor does Batman use any of his storied detective skills to ferret out the culprit.  In Loeb's world, the killer is just delivered to our doorstep like a shabbily wrapped present with a rumpled bow slapped on it to distract us from the complete lack of logical storytelling.    Critique of artwork can be a very subjective thing.  Basic anatomy and proportions, however, are not.  Tim Sale is an atrocious artist who uses \\"style\\" as an excuse to avoid learning the dimensions of the human form.  Eye placement is generally not three eyes apart, bones aren't made of rubber and, last I checked, we all don't have 137 teeth in our mouths.  I know that his fans will tell me that I just don't understand his interpretation of the characters or whatever...but I'm here to tell you this:  Jack Kirby had a style.  John Byrne has a style.  Jim Lee has a style.  Mike Mignola has a style.  Sale is a sloppy, lazy artist using thick brushes and India ink to hide his lack of skill and detail.  If the story had been incredible, I still would have been distracted by a disjointed Catwoman with enormous hips and pencil thin ankles, her entire body contorted to the point of an apparent spine injury.    I have to admit, this work was so awful that I probably never would have written a review of it.  But it was recommended so highly by the comic shop guy and then the scads of reviews here and elsewhere singing its praises, I feel more than a little slighted by my purchase.  It's this kind of praise of a truly unworthy piece of work that gives comic fans a bad name.  This is a work of sub-par intelligence, a contrived story with no backbone or direction.  It reminds me of the Phantom Menace in that you could take out the middle and just read the beginning and the end and come away with the same experience, just with a lot less wasted time.    If you're interested in actual story telling, try some of the following:  Planetary, Preacher, Concrete, Usagi Yojimbo, Ultimates (v1 & 2 only...3 is by Loeb and Madiera and it's really terrible), Old Man Logan, Powers, Fables, The Boys, Astonishing X-Men (Whedon/Cassaday), The Walking Dead, Ex Machina, Y: The Last Man, 100 Bullets and Invincible just to name a few.

More emotional tug o war. If you expect and want these, then you will be happy. But the problem with this otherise good story is that the plot is structured so the reader anicpates and hungers for Katniss to be the active participant in a crucial event at a specific moment. Without giving anything away I will just warn you to expect the story to shift out of active and engaging scene when you don't want it to. Collins has her reasons (integrity of story and authorial purpose I suppose), but I am afraid those reasons deny the reader a more satisfying read. This type of ending is the epitome of conflicting desires: the author's and the reader's.
B002ZG977Y|5.0|I must say that I have every kind of movie there is and love the original version of Clash of the Titans.  This was a very good remake and very entertaining with the visual and special effects.  I enjoy it very much, this was a great purchase for me.  The characters were great especially Sam Worthington, which did a great job in Avatar.  This is a very enjoyable movie.
B004ID52YO|3.0|I'm finding this effort by White Lies to be less sing along, toe tapping and head nodding than \\"To Lose My life\\". There is a noticeable increased reliance on electronics on this album. Sometimes it works and other times not so much. The album lacks a certain cohesion. At times they sound like an 80's synthpop band and other times, a rock band who effectively uses synths to accent their sound. Too much electronics can render a sound very generic if not done right. What comes off on this album is a darker sound which at times buries any hooks in layers of electronics and processing.      At times, this release sounds over-produced (effects and electronics).    This is still a good album and the more I listen to it the more I like it. It's not nearly as fun or memorable as their previous work. This is one of those cases where you wonder if the band is happy with the new songs or if they were pushed in a certain direction by producers?    Looking forward to future material from White Lies.
B002ZG994U|4.0|Great movie as far as a true action movie. Plus, you can hardly go wrong with deep actors like Liam Neeson.
0439023491|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing! I loved it so much! I thought that it wouldn't equal up to the first Hunger Games but it actually built on it and made something better!
B002PLALCE|5.0|All of the American Recordings cd's are just amazing.  Even long time johnny cash fans will be startled by the emotion and starkness of these recordings.  While Johnny's voice is not as it was when he was younger, it is still very recognizable.  The cd starts off with \\"Help Me\\", in which Cash is asking the Lord to \\"help me walk just one more mile\\".  These recordings are just incredibly moving, especially when you know that they are among the last ones that Cash would make.  I also recommend \\"Cash Unearthed\\" - a 5 cd set which includes one volume of the best of Cash on American plus 4 other cd's of \\"outtakes\\" not on any of the other 6 American Cash releases.  This is great stuff - it's like Johnny's autobiography in song written during his last days.

B002JVWQSW|5.0|First time I have ever bought TV series on DVD - there are not that many shows I feel like anyone would watch again, but this one was too good of a deal to pass up and it is funny even after multiple viewings!
1882723007|5.0|This is the most excellent book I have read in years. What a blessing that Betty was allowed to live to tell of her wonderful heavenly experience. We can all learn from it and be blessed. It has changed my life forever.
0439023513|5.0|I couldn't believe how much action was in this story! Usually the last book in any series is slow and winds down the series but ot this book!! I just hope that there is a fourth one coming out T_T I know I know it's supposed to be a trilogy but I still can't help but hope...
B0043RSE2M|5.0|Bought this for the kids who loved it.  They keep laughing and laughing.   They watch both the 3D version at home, but then have taken the DVD copy with them in the car and airplane.  I found it well worth spending the extra money to get combo pack.
0312600844|2.0|I read this book because it was on the \\"Year's Best\\" lists, and I was deeply disappointed. I feel that Franzen bites off more than he can chew, causing the story to lurch and go off track on several occasions. Characters appeared and disappeared, and their inner changes seemed forced, and not a natural consequence of the story's movement. Others show up for no real reason that I can tell (Walter's grandfather, who gets a lot of page time late in the story, interrupting more interesting stuff--why?).<br /><br />I felt that the political aspects of the story could have been woven in better, rather than just going on and on and on. It got so tedious that I almost stopped reading it, and only determination and a hope for a decent ending kept me slogging through.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|Loved it!  Can't say anything negative.  Great twists, turns, plots and there are at least four(4)HUGE \\"I-didn't-see-that-comings!\\"  Gonna read it again!
030746363X|4.0|I purchased this book when it came out and after reading through most of it I thought I'd see what the review boards had to say on the subject.      It appears that there is a suspicion that people are artificially inflating the ratings, that this book is just a collection of Tim's blogs (which I don't read), that this book is full of fluff, and that this book contradicts itself.    I liked the book, and while it IS full of fluff, its also large enough that there is a decent amount of good information in there as well.  Furthermore, yes, Tim strikes me as a jackass, but who else would pour as much time into himself as this book lead me to believe he did?  Do you really expect anything less than the confident, narcissistic individual that he comes across as?  In regards to criticism that this is a collection of blogs, that doesn't bother me because I don't read the blogs and would prefer to have them all bound together nicely even if I did.  This book was pretty cheap, and for what I paid, I'm pleased with what I got.  As for the criticism that the book contradicts itself, well that is both true and not true.  It IS physically impossible to follow everything in the book at the same time.  You can't do it for the same reason you can't both make significant strength gains and lose a significant amount of weight at the same time (assuming your already fit, this example does not apply to people with a large quantity of fat to begin with!).  If you have a specific goal, you can follow the advice Tim gives in regards to that goal.    My major gripe with the book is that it is dis-organized and as many others have pointed out, it has no comprehensive plans for any of the chapters or goals.  Many of the chapters are a bit vague, or present only a portion of the plan you'd need to follow. This doesn't bother me personally because I've been reading fitness books for many years now and am an avid fitness enthusiast.  I've tried many different exercise plans, diet plans, etc. (most recently completing the P90X program) and so I've plenty to draw from to fill in the holes that Tim leaves.  For me, this is a book from which I can cherry pick interesting facts and tidbits, thus, for me, it works.    I would not recommend this for a novice.  Someone trying to get into fitness would do well to start with a book designed for beginners.      This book is ideal for someone who   1) already knows a lot about working out and dieting,   2) is looking for some slightly wacky and different things to add to their routines, and   3) doesn't read Tim's blogs since apparently this stuff is all online.
0312370849|5.0|I really don't understand why there are so many negative reviews.  I think perhaps people expect too much: this was meant to be an \\"oprah\\" type book, not the next Diary of Anne Frank.  To me, the author's use of alternating story lines worked well.  I don't think they were meant to be different points of view, really, but Julia sharing Sarah's story (though, of course, there were parts that Julia couldn't have known).  I imagined the whole thing as a sort of memoir/novel that Julia might have written years later.  And I was happy with the ending.  Sarah's part of the story ended appropriately, it somehow wouldn't have been realistic for everything to have ended happily.      Anyway, I just think people might expect too much out of this NOVEL. Someone stated that it was unrealistic for Sarah to have escaped at all...but I'm pretty sure that there are some children who really did escape, and there is nothing wrong with an author imagining what might have happened.  I think the main theme of the the Julia part of the book was to teach that such horrors should not be forgotten, or ignored, but mourned and acknowledged, so that they don't happen again.     I was fully absorbed by this book, and I certainly didn't find Julia to be an unsympathetic character like others did...I think that she focused on Sarah's life so much (to the point of obsession), so that she didn't have to face the reality of the end of her marriage.  And I thought the ending was sweet, even if it was a bit cheesy.  There is nothing wrong with adding a bit of light, easy (even if somewhat trite) hint of romance to balance out the horrors of what happened to the Jewish people of Paris.
B001GGWFFA|5.0|I just got this 5 disc set as a gift.  I have \\"On An Island\\" and this is the entire album live and more.  Incredible performances, David Gilmour gives a beyond 5 star performance.  The sound is phenomenal.  I can't recommend this enough.  You can lose yourself and forget you are at home watching this with the lights off and the surround sound.  Just wonderful.  This is the most glorious gift, I have thanked the person that got this for me.  I LOVE IT.  For Pink Floyd fans it's an absolute, I mean absolute must.  No matter how much it costs, I can tell you it's worth every cent.  It is very intimate for such a huge concert, the orchestration is great.  Top notch in every way - the entire packaging is brilliant.  Entirely enjoyable.  Will watch and listen endlessly again and again.  Perfect.
B004AHNIGM|4.0|This is a very different kind of Gregg Allman album. Laid back and most definitely not too slick. The instrumentation and arrangements are loose and live sounding. T-Bone Burnett produced it in his inimtitable style. It sounds like they just opened a mic in the room and played. No overdubs, no frills, no multiple takes, and stripped down playing. Sonics are in the same vein as a 1940's or 50's recording which sounds like it was recorded with analog tape and run through tube equipment. If your playback system is not up to snuff, it can sound a little thick and muddy through the bass. And Gregg sounds like he's 8 feet away from the mic. Very enjoyable altogether though. Old and rootsy blues with a broad selection of covered material which is not too mainstream or well-known. I rank it up there with Gregg's finest, although I wish he had played a bit more B-3 organ on the album. This album grows on you and it leaves you wishing for more. A good sign I would say.
0375851569|5.0|Almost everyone knows that Dr. Suess has written some of the best, most entertaining books for children.  The selection of books in this boxed set is wonderful. My favorite, Green Eggs and Ham, is included.  I bought these books as the first Dr. Suess books for a new baby in the family.  Everyone was pleased with the collection.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|The beauty of our planet, the awesomeness of the variety of life, and amazing shots taken by the crew. This series makes you step back and simply say, woah I live here. My only gripe would be the quality of some scenes noise wise seems to differ, not only with very dark scenes where noise is to be expected.

B0041QSZJM|5.0|We became fans of Pink Martini after experiencing their infectious music in the Disney concert hall in Los Angeles on New Years Eve.  We have all of Pink Martini's albums. Each one adds new musical ideas while keeping the best of their previous releases.  This Christmas album keeps up the good work.  There are a few familiar selections, but more new songs appropriate to the various celebrations of the season.  The energy is there, with China Forbes' great voice and a few wonderful new twists.  Add it to your seasonal collection, but pull it out in July for a treat.
B0034G4P7Q|5.0|Among other things, this film is the story about the birth of the empire. Whether or not you actually use it, you know what facebook is unless you've lived under a rock for the last five years. As a user of this wonderful social networking site, I was surprised about how little I actually knew about the founding of this juggernaut. The film is beautifully shot (as always) by Fincher, has a wonderful ensemble cast and has one of the best scores of any film I've heard in ages. This is not even mentioning the wonderful script that truly breathes life into a film that many would have said unmakeable a year ago. Now it's a Golden Globe winner and sure to pick up some top honors at the Oscars. What I found most fascinating about this film is the apparent rift between generations in our world. Most telling of this is the scene with the Winkelvi and the dean of Harvard. His dismissal of their idea of something intangible such as digital ownership of an idea shows how clueless the older generation is of the younger's potential. Simultaneously this potential is devestating in how it effects the creators. A multi dimensional and layered masterpiece that is sure to become a touchstone of American cinema, I'm looking forward to the \\"kids\\" cleaning up at the Oscars.
B003B13QQU|5.0|Not my favorite Goldfrapp album, but still an excellent disc.  I understand why some people think it's not their best work, but it captures exactly the sound and style they intended it to. If you want electro-glam, 80s style, this is the disc to have.  Lots of other groups trying this sound right now, but it usually comes off as forced.  I think, for whatever reason, it seems a natural fit to Goldfrapp's musical sensibilities, and vocal stylings.  Favorite tracks are Believer, Head First and Voicething.

B003UESJH4|5.0|The King's Speech is an outstanding movie, and it should win an Academy Award for Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Supporting Actor.    Even if you never go to a movie because you're disgusted with the quality of movies these days, do not miss The King's Speech.  The audience actually applauded when I saw it.    Many people dread going to the multi-plex movie theaters today because of sky-high prices, mobs of teen-agers, and no atmosphere.  I saw it at one of the remaining art-deco theaters that were built in the 1920's.    Look around in your area for an historic theater that still survives and support it.  I drove 35 minutes to get to this particular historic theater, and it was well worth the effort.
061891868X|4.0|Smolin presents the development of different theories of unification and their relation to laboratory results. Some, especially string theory, cannot be proven as yet, so he does not see the need to give it the importance that it has in the physics community. Surprising ideas given that he had worked in the area. Regrets, but overall very good.
0374158460|1.0|I got about half way through this, but found it quite rambling............too many things going on. I decided to take it back to the library when Joey described loving his girlfriend so much he would eat her poops, and they would tasted like chocolate.  I can't go past that point. It is an image I wish I didn't read about.  This book has had a lot of hype, but I really cannot understand why.
B0041T7FS6|5.0|Having grown up in the 70's and 80's, this box set is essential listening either purely on a groove level or as a timepiece for how classic disco music existed and was created.  Nile Rodgers, Bernard Edwards, Tony Thompson, Rob Sabino, Fonzi Thornton, Luci Martin, Michelle Cobbs and the rest of the Chic Organization all helped to create a new sound (how many artists can make that claim!) based on soul, blues, jazz and then expanded it to the dancefloor.  An amazing listening experience just to listen to Bernard Edwards' bass, Nile Rodgers guitar, turn this baby up loud, and you will MOVE.<br />Famed remixer extraordinaire Dimitri From Paris handled six remixes and there are unreleased outtakes, and even more exciting are three of the eight songs Chic did with the legendary Johnny Mathis from the 1980 unreleased album, \\"I Love My Lady\\".<br />It took 30 years but to have these three collaborations with Johnny Mathis makes this box set a complete joy!  Johnny Mathis holds a note (for approximately half a minute!) on the soulful, \\"I Want To Fall In Love\\" that took my breath away.  I really, really hope that Sony does go ahead and release this album sometime soon (most of the other songs from that album can be heard on line).<br />A huge shout out to Warner Music France for putting this box set together for the many, many fans of this music taking it's rightful place in our modern music history.<br />And, of course, thank you to those magicians, those men and women who's music will truly live on, on the dance floor and off.

B0044XV3R8|5.0|I know there is a lot of controversy surrounding this release. Yes, a DVD was released last year, a bare bones DVD at that, and now they're releasing this. Big freaking deal.<br /><br />Personally, I don't care about all that crap. I didn't buy the original DVD, and if I had it may somewhat alter my opinion, but I didn't. This is the first Avatar DVD I have bought, and to be honest, originally I had no desire to see Avatar. I had an ex girlfriend who ruined the movie for me and I just didn't want to see it, but one day I was bored and ordered it On Demand. And I loved it.<br /><br />This set is fantastic, it's got three versions of the film. The first is the original theatrical version, then there's the re-release version with eight minutes of new footage, and THEN there's the collector's edition with 16 minutes of new footage. Epic doesn't even begin to cover it.<br /><br />The documentary is great too. It covers all the aspects of filming and is probably 90 minutes long. Very interesting.<br /><br />If you liked Avatar and bought the bare bones DVD, I suggest you sell it and buy this one.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This movie is beautifully produced and acted.  The personalities of the characters are believable. And the only word to describe moody Mr. Rochester is *swoon*. A definite staple of a movie collection.
B0015DROBO|1.0|This may have been a good read in its original language but it is not tranlated well. It reads more like a transliteration than a translation.
0553801473|1.0|The weaknesses of this installment have been well documented by others.  Basically I think that George has just lost his passion for this series.  He considered this project a burden, and it just seems like he pulled an all-nighter to turn in a term paper hoping for a C-.  Unfortunately for his readership, this all-nighter was 11 years in the making for Jon, Tyrion, and Dany, and the grade he gets from me is an F.<br /><br />Nothing works in this installment.  Everything is severely disjointed with many of the characters over 3000 miles apart with very little overlap.  Also now with 16 points of view, the plot completely stagnates.  There just not a compelling story for many of these characters, besides how much can you really do with just 40 or 50 pages devoted to Cersei, followed by 40-50 devoted to Bran, then 20 to Jaime, then 50 to Arya.  You get the idea.  The book gets bloated really quick when you have so many characters spread out over so many different locations.  The story is just suffocated, or maybe it's just not there anymore.  I'm leaning toward the latter.

B002HJ9PTO|5.0|I needed a small lapel mike for a very specific purpose, i.e., for monitoring my singing practice using a small Tascam voice training device. Unpowered condenser mics just won't work in this context; I needed something that supplies its own juice. This small Audio-Technica lapel mic is really the only item in its price class that will work for me. And it does work! Certainly the audio quality is not stellar, but it really does not have to be. It amplifies my singing (I monitor through in-ear monitors) and I then can evaluate whether I'm hitting the notes, have proper diction, timing, etc. And I can do this hands-free, while walking my dog (I do this in largely people-free places :-)).     The device goes through the LR44 batteries fairly rapidly, but that's to be expected for a tiny, powered device that uses a button-type battery. I can't complain.    Overall, I'm grateful that Audio-Technica has marketed this marvelous little microphone. It's a fine product, considering its modest price.

B00275EGWY|5.0|This movie didn't feel like a movie but like you were really there in the war zone and feeling all the fear, intense emotion and crying at our human failings especially when the young kid gets injured.  You root for them, with them and cry with them.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was an excellent book, I would have never been interested in a post apocalyptic  story, however the reviews of this book led me to try it. I found it to be an  extremely well written page turner.
B0034G4P7Q|5.0|It's interesting to read the negative reviews of this movie, because immediately I begin to wonder, who (from the FACEBOOK staff) is writing it? The bottom line is this: We are fascinated with the lives of people who create ideas that have world wide appeal, before we actually thought of them! This kid was (no doubt) as depicted in the movie...arrogant, insecure and hungry for recognition and attention. On top of that, he was steadfast in his mission to work hard to achieve his goals, and do whatever was necessary to make them a reality. It's easy to sit from the cushy comforts of ones couch and judge a man based on his documentary, but I challenge anyone who has the opportunity, to get as far as this kid has gotten without Fu**ing someone over.  I don't think it's possible, although I wish it were.  Aside from my personal opinion of this movie, there isn't a better writer in the business telling the story...and that's just a fact. The movie will win the Oscar, and it will be deserving.
B000024D4R|5.0|Although maybe not as well known as the others, it definitely should be, because this is the best Pink Floyd album. It is perfect...the composition,the layers, and even the lyrics..which I think are Waters' best. But it is the music that really sets it apart from Pink Floyd's other work (all of which is awesome; especially the exceptional Dark Side of the Moon, Meddle, and Wish You Were Here). This is a much harder, straight forward rock album...Thank you David Gilmour.
B00328R21C|5.0|I purchased this toy for my nephew, who is interested in Star Wars. Being of a certain age, I can really relate to the original Star Wars figures.  I saw the new movies, but didn't love them and remember them - not like with the originals.  So I was pleased to find this landspeeder to tie the generations together.  Very cool, fun characters - it's a great set.      As for the price - many reviewers are complaining how Amazon has jacked up the price by over $10.  I agree this unfair, and am disappointed in Amazon - free shipping isn't that free when you pay an inflated price for the product.  That said, I did order this from Amazon instead of Lego.com, because once Lego added the shipping and tax, the Landspeeder was only $3 cheaper than Amazon, and I also needed by buy something for my niece, so in the end, I did come out ahead on the 2 items.  Amazon used to be my go-to site, but now I don't trust them, and never order something without first confirming the retail price from other sources.    Bottom line - love the Legos Landspeeder.  Amazon, not so much.
B0046UGSNS|3.0|I rented The Kids Are Alright because I had tried to no avail to see it in the theatre since it was so acclaimed by everyone. I usually like Indie films like this, and to be fair, this one started out pretty good. Mark Ruffalo definitely has not gotten the proper praise for his acting chops. He is far more talented than half the pretty boy actors on screen. But I digress. The combination of Ruffalo, Benning, Moore, and Mia Wasikowska had all the making of a brilliant cast. However, Moore and Bening's talent is squandered on painful stereotypes. Moore plays the \\"mom\\" role and the hippie, granola lesbian, whiike Bening plays the masculine provider head of the household role. It almost felt like a set back to have two women fall into gender roles in a relationship. Also what could have been a flawless, organic story about two children needing to know their father was ruined by Hollywood's need for sex and scandal. That aside, some parts of the story did work well. The overall concept of the movie is one that will speak to any child or parent who has used the same methods to create their family.  I only wish that the story coukd have been told without giving in to it's need to sell tickets or receive an award. Furthermore, it is not a comedy. And I am positive there were better comedies up for a golden globe.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|What's the selling point of RED? Stars you like doing stuff you like, mainly shooting things. At this, the film does very well. And fortunately, the things it doesn't do very well don't detract from the film that much.<br /><br />Granted, the plot is incomprehensible, and the supposed twists at the end will have you thoroughly scratching your head, but most of the main plot points at least have an interesting action setpiece surrounding it. Also, I had a big problem with Morgan Freeman in this film, as he gets second billing, but is in the film a grand total of 10 minutes. He's good during those 10 minutes, but it's little more than a glorified extended cameo, since he doesn't really factor into much of anything very much. I mean, was he too busy filming Thick as Thieves or any of the other myriad straight-to-dvd trash he's been involved with in the past decade? Sorry, just had to get those off my chest.<br /><br />Still, RED mostly makes it up with a great cast and creative action. It's hard to tell what Bruce Willis phoning in a performance is anymore, but here he's just Bruce Willis, and the results are pretty nice. He's still believable as an elite assassin type who can best men half his age, and he pulls the romantic aspects of the plot fine as well. Which brings me to Mary-Louise Parker who while I've never been a particular fan of, does a good job as the cute government customer service girl dragged into this crazy conspiracy. She's charming and funny, and while she isn't exactly asked to do a lot, she does a very good job with what she has. Helen Mirren and Brian Cox are appropriately cute together. Karl Urban sounds exactly like Dr. McCoy as a CIA agent, but he's actually quite likable despite some of the more cliched aspects of his character.<br /><br />Still, none of them quite reach the level of John Malkovich having a helluva good time as the LSD-dosed paranoid agent who serves about 85% of the comedic beats of this action comedy. He really gives a lot to the role, giving the appropriate amount of crazy to make this character, who at one point charges at the Vice-President with a fake bomb strapped to him, really funny and memorable. He has a lot of great lines, he has some good action beats, and he's given a lot of great stuff to play off of, mainly his pink pig.<br /><br />As for the action, it has a lot of creative over-the-top sequences, never too far apart, to keep you thoroughly entertained throughout. There's the awesome Bruce Willis stepping out of a moving/spinning car while shooting a guy scene, but the scene taking place with a bunch of cargo crates probably takes the cake. It's fairly short, but it exemplifies everything to like about the movie.

It's pretty accessible to most anybody if you want a good date movie, action movie or comedy, and judging by the reaction in my theater audience, it's also quite the crowd-pleaser. So, if you want a bunch of Retired, but Extremely Dangerous people to invade your screen for a good time, put in RED.appropriate amount of crazy to make this character, who at one point charges at the Vice-President with a fake bomb strapped to him, really funny and memorable. He has a lot of great lines, he has some good action beats, and he's given a lot of great stuff to play off of, mainly his pink pig.    As for the action, it has a lot of creative over-the-top sequences, never too far apart, to keep you thoroughly entertained throughout.

B002KSPKRS|5.0|I bought these headests for my birthday and have been using them for some time. They are an awsome set of headsets if you have the money. I have had one problem and that was not even with the headset itself. The cord connecting the headset to the controller is a little cheap and I accidentally pulled on it a little too hard, heard a snap, and I lost voice communications. But then i just bought another cord and it works perfectly fine, so great headset but be careful with some of the cords.The other problem concerns the trasmitter. I am not all that tech savvy so sorry if I get some things wrong, but i believe that the way the headset and the transmitter communicate blocks the connection to xbox live sometimes. Easily fixable if you just turn off the transmitter until you sign-in then turning it back on and I do not mind doing this all that much. Other than those concerns, this is a great headset and I highly recommend it.

B003YFIUW8|5.0|This book is unlike any that I've read and I absolutely loved it. It is a simple story and concept, but told from a perspective that will keep you both laughing and considering your own view points of \\"reality\\". It is inspirational in the same tone that \\"Life is Beautiful\\" was to me - in that story a father chooses to have his son believe that they are in the middle of an elaborate game, while in reality they are placed in a Nazi concentration camp. The mother in \\"Room\\" makes a similar choice - and for those of you that enter \\"Room\\" - consider what choices you would have made given the same scenario.

0312323867|4.0|Personally, I prefer Something Blue over Something Borrowed. I must admit, I never cared for Darcy in Something Borowed because she was just another one of those stuck up rich girls who never knew how to care for anyone else but themselves. However, when Something Blue actually took me to a tour inside Darcy's real views, I started to understand her. She was not stuck-up self-centered rich girl. I almost began to adore her for her ability to be so true to herself and others. We tend to always unconciously lie to others out of intendity to be polite (so-called white lies) but this girl does not know how to fake herself. I never knew I would love Darcy over Rachel, but here I am. The same story that we read from Rachel's point of view is a lot different from what Darcy tells us, and it sure is more exciting.  Darcy may seem harsh, mean, and even immature at times; but her way of loving life and actually knowing how to enjoy it, amused me throughout the whole book!
1594202842|3.0|I reviewed this book for Bookbrowse in November of last year.  This is the most subjective review I have ever written, but I cannot be objective about this book.  I find it very hard to relate to Amy Chua.  She is a fiercely driven woman, and as such, she is fiercely driving her two daughters.  The elder seems able to go with it, but the younger is rebellious.  The author paints a picture of a household in perpetual upheaval, with acrimonious shouting contests between her and each of her daughters, mostly Lulu, the youngest, contrasting her methods as a \\"Chinese mother\\" to the comparatively passive and permissive style of western mothers.  Yet she is a Chinese woman born in this country, married to a Jewish man, and almost psychopathic about being a \\"Chinese mother.\\"  There is a disconnect here that I have a hard time grasping.<br /><br />When I first started this book, I wasn't sure I would make it through; I couldn't believe what I was reading.  Can any woman really, honestly believe this this kind of behavior is beneficial to her children?  Is she really so disillusioned as to be able to convince herself and the reader that her way is the right way?<br /><br />I managed to finish this book, since it is an engaging read;  but I was shaking my head more often than not.  Her husband is a saint, or an idiot, I'm not quite sure which.  Both of them are extremely high achievers, yet somehow he seems normal and you wonder how he can stand by and watch this behavior toward his children. She has created a seemingly dysfunctional environment for her very talented girls. One wonders why she would \\"put it all out there\\" as she does in this book.  To what end?<br /><br />Interesting book.
B0041T52S6|1.0|I understand all those people who liked it or over loved it.    I thought it was original and kind of fun. But there was absolutely nothing that I loved in this movie.    In the end... I was just bored to death. Actually, even before the end, right from the beginning, but somehow I was expecting something to actually happen in this movie. Nothing happened. It's just a loser who's 22, going out with high school girls he won't even kiss, and who \\"kind of falls in love\\" with a weird girl who's way too cool for him...    I guess this movie was way too cool for me. Eventually, it kind of sucked... :-/
B003X7MCGW|5.0|I honestly thought this was just a greatest hits album, and so I bought it for $5 on Amazon.  Then I listened to it on a recent trip and I haven't wanted to stop since.  They absolutely improved on the original album versions of their songs.  I feel like I'm listening to classic southern rock at its finest.  I have a newfound respect for these guys - just some good good music!

I'm sure we will be seeing her in future movies. Her voice is one of a kind. Speaking of one of a kind I could listen to Christina and Duffy all day long. They are unique and can really sing. They both could have been huge hits in the 60's right along with the greats.

0131480057|5.0|I encountered the first edition of this book in the early 90's when I was first learning Unix.  It was the textbook for a college Unix Admin course.  It moved to my desk when I started working as a system administrator, and was a constant reference whenever there was something concrete I needed to set up.    Over time, as Unix evolved, each new edition immediately replaced the prior addition as my #1 reference.  The fourth edition is the most changed, reflecting the rise of Linux, internet and the Web, and coexistence with Microsoft Windows.  It remains the first book to look into when you need to get something done, or want to know how something works.

B001QOOCTE|5.0|Ever been happy and sad at the same time? I bought this CD just so I could have the 5+ minute version of \\"Stand By Me.\\" I received an email video of the song right around the time that my wife died of cancer in June 2008, and I added the song to the other 14 that are on her memorial website [...] I am a DJ and will continue to play this version of the song in her memory for as long as I am able to play music. The CD and the DVD and the whole project promote the spirit of peace on earth through music. That is a pretty strong and powerful tonic for the grief that comes with losing your best friend. Don't trust just me - go on the Internet and listen to the music and watch the performers. It is both moving and comforting to know that great music will live forever. And so do our loved ones, wherever they are.

0316776963|3.0|On the recommendation of a co-worker, I picked up a copy Me Talk Pretty One Day and I was pleasantly surprised to discover a very hilarious and entertaining book. Author David Sedaris is so full of intelligent humor and sharp wit.     Through a series of essays, Me Talk Pretty One Day painted a vivid and insightful snapshot of the author's family dynamic, his struggle back with drug abuse and personal redemption. There were so many laugh-out loud moments in the book, especially stories involving Sedaris' brother Paul and some of my favorite chapters were the author's time living in France.     Sedaris is a wonderful contemporary storyteller, especially when he is describing everyday interactions with other people. The stories of his personal development were quite hilarious, sometimes painful but always interesting to read.

B004APVI1G|4.0|The Legend of the Guardians is a strange tale- and I'm not even talking about the actual film.  Hyped during its theatrical run (which began on September 24th of 2010), Warner Brother announced that it was scheduled for a mid-February DVD/ Blu-ray release.  Then suddenly (presumably in effort to capitalize on the spend-happy Holiday shopper scene), the DVD & Blu-ray were released and with virtually no hoopla on December 17th.  I nearly completely overlooked it as a result except for the fact that when preordering Despicable Me, I was recommended Guardians with the sub text \\"available now\\".<br /><br />Going into the film, I was aware of the fact that the material would be joining an ever-growing list (a list that includes Shrek, Meet the Robinsons, How to Train your Dragon, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs to mention a few) of animated features based on popular children's book series.  This one was done up by the studio responsible for Happy Feet (Village Roadshow), distributed by powerhouse Warner Brothers and represents Zack Snyder's (the man responsible for such works as Watchmen and 300) directorial debut in animated feature film.<br /><br />On the whole, Warner Brothers has been lagging behind in the highly lucrative animated feature market; a place dominated by Disney/ Pixar and DreamWorks.  Other studios in similar positions have begun to realize the potential in this segment and are putting in serious work to catch up (Sony with ImageWorks, 20th Century Fox with Blue Sky and so on).  WB hasn't proven quite as eager as the competition so converting Kathryn Lasky's series of young reader fantasy books into CG is about as good a place to start making up for lost time.<br /><br />Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole' uses personified owls to weave its tale in a completely fantastical world (seemingly devoid of humans).  The plot works on the fantasy template on nearly a point-by-point basis:  A young, inexperienced (eventual) hero is introduced from the safety of his picturesque home.  Innocence and security are whisked away by invasion of a powerful enemy army, complete with a weapon of incalculable advantage.  The only force in the world capable of keeping the rising threat at bay have long since retired to the recesses of memory and myth.<br /><br />The quest begins to not only prove the legend true, but to convince the Guardians to come out of their self-imposed retirement to once again rise up against this evil empire (The Pure Ones) to restore peace and harmony to the whole land.  Along the way there will be requisite betrayals, family division, advice from goodhearted heroes, training from hardened warriors, a better understanding of the horrors of war and why freedom is worth fighting to preserve.<br /><br />If this all sounds familiar, that's because it's a story archetype that's been told countless times throughout the ages.  Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Eragon; you can find this precise tale in various forms of entertainment spanning literature, film, poetry, folklore and so on.  However, don't be mistaken into believing that because its formulaic, Legend of the Guardians comes up short.  But we'll get to that.<br /><br />Notice the apparent lack of names included in my above story summary?  That was a deliberate homage to the actual experience in that upon the film's conclusion, I was confident only in the names of two of the fifteen main characters.<br /><br />Names like Otulissa, Strix Struma, Ezylryb, Eglantine and Allomere were made clear to me only in post-viewing research and even then I was quite unsure which were which. Australian accents and little scripting effort to embed faces with the names results is a definite \\"so that's the main guy's brother there?\\" experience.  Fortunately, somehow, the film suffers none as a result of this little snafu.  A marketing disaster, sure, but the entertainment value endures.<br /><br />And speaking of entertainment value, Legend of the Guardians is a visual feast! It can truly be said that Pixar and DreamWorks have absolutely nothing on Village Roadshow.  Lighting is spectacular, settings are rich with background detail and the character models are so well textured/ animated that they often border on photorealism.  The flight sequences, particularly when viewed in high-definition, are breathtaking.  I can only imagine what the experience must have been like in a 3D theater.<br /><br />There are a few complaints to be voiced however.  The weapon of the enemy (an energy field that somehow captures owls and renders them helpless) is kept a complete mystery to the viewer for the duration of the film.  Whether or not it is better explained in the source material books, I cannot say, but aside from requiring tiny little pieces of metal to function, it is nothing more than a one-dimensional plot device here.<br /><br />Also the PG rating should be taken quite seriously as, though animated, this film contains some pretty intense sequences that will surely unsettle the youngsters.  Additionally, even if the kid in question is desensitized to such things, the plot and themes would likely be a bit heavy/ hard to follow for younger tykes.<br /><br />In all though, despite what surely sounds like multiple complaints, Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole' is a surprisingly solid piece of computer generated film.  The story is a bit clich&eacute; yet it still manages to engross, the character and location names are a venerable mystery, yet the story manages to shine through, the 3D revolution may be a fad but the visuals here simply refuse to stop dazzling.  At the end of the day, the movie is 97 minutes of sheer enjoyable adventure: a classic tale of good versus evil, told with animation of absolutely epic proportions.  The fantasy element is quite strong throughout and offers fans of films like the Harry Potter series, Lord of the Rings and Star Wars a fully CG feature to relish.olutely nothing on Village Roadshow.

B000PMLFRA|1.0|Lucas is only releasing the bastard versions of the origonal trilogy, not in combination with the origonal theatrical versions as he did with the DVDs.  Thus I will not buy them on Blu-ray and simply rent them from Netflix to view the extra non-movie content.<br /><br />This is from a nerd that bought a Laser disk player 1992 simply because they released SW on disk.<br /><br />I'm hoping that some day Lucas will learn from his mistakes and realize that the fans (over age 10) want the REAL versions of these movies, but that day seems like it will never come.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Star Wars was the first movie I ever saw in a theater and I remember it to this day.  All I want to do is relive that magic in high definition.  I don't want to see his original vision or any such nonsense, I simply want to relive a fantastic movie in the format we all originally saw it and fell in love with it, and I'd like to relive it in HD.
076115678X|1.0|I read this book in 2 hours and am going to return it. This book is nothing more than 180 pages of filler (probably the most inflated-pamphlet-like book I've ever read--there's even a couple pages dedicated to curly girl \\"horoscopes\\"), and what's worse, it reads like an advertisement for author Lorraine Massey's shampoos and conditioners. The following bits are regurgitated constantly:     2) Use sulfate-free shampoo--detergents are the devil    3) Use \\"botanical\\" conditioner    Both of these are blatant attributes of Massey's DevaCurl line.     Sure, there are a few pages that explain in the simplest, vaguest terms the different kinds of curls, how to do a couple dated-looking hairstyles (the wet-look of many of the photos is so 80s), and a few recipes (12, to be exact), but mostly this book is a broken record, repeating the same information page after page.     The book has a very \\"we shall overcome\\" tone. There are more than enough sob stories (called \\"Curl Confessions\\") where curly girls describe how they had to get past the pain and sadness caused by their curly hair growing up and how they had to finally accept and love their curls. If you were traumatized because of your curly hair when you were younger, you might enjoy these. If, like me, you simply wanted to find some info on how to take care of your particular type of curls, you're going to find many more dedicated self-help pages than you bargained for.     As other reviewers have said, this book encourages an almost obsessive maintenance routine for your curly hair, telling you to throw away all your brushes and that if you decide to \\"blow-fry\\" your hair even once, all your \\"progress\\" on the road to perfect curls will be lost. Don't expect any suggestions for low-maintenance girls in this book.     The most annoying thing? Pretty much all the information in this book can be found for free on naturallycurly.com. Overall, not worth buying.
B000VUQ4HW|5.0|I don't buy many DVDs and especially not old movies. However since I was a kid I always knew about this old movie. Probably since some clips of Nosferatu have been used and referenced in many other videos. So I went looking at DVD releases of the original film but mostly the reviews weren't that good. Either they had poor video or sound quality. This one is NOT like that. I loved it! Even though it is a silent film (admittedly the only one I have ever watched) it is a great horror movie. If you like vampire movies you should definitely check out this version of the original vampire.
B000063DIH|5.0|This album has 5 really amazing songs and some other a little bit average but good. The classic good Iron Maiden -> riffs , solos , rhythmic melodic guitars and very good vocals by Bruce. The general feeling you got by hearing this album is very nice -> they play lets say <<soft>> heavy metal. The melodies are hypnotic and all the chorus are very memorable. Unfortunately this is the last good album...............after this...the chaos.

B003XMKMTQ|5.0|Great DVD. Fantastic music by some of the world's best! Eric put together many styles so there is something here for every guitar fan. Contains several mini interviews with players and friends. This one is the first in the series (see also 2007 and 2010) and I believe contains the best music of the three. Also, again different from the subsequent two, there is no emcee; the music just sort of transitions from artist to artist. Filmed in Texas.
B0000024W3|5.0|This is the first Bob Dylan album I bought (after the first Greatest Hits package). I bought it when it came out because it was the new one, it was a double album, I already had the hits and the price was right. It is still my favorite Bob Dylan album, even though I know it's considered by most to be sub par. The songs are great; his performances are spot on; it isn't over produced; the backing is inspired genius; he doesn't appear to be trying to be mysterious or preachy; he doesn't try to squeeze in fifteen rhymes for \\"orange;\\" the harmonica is kept to a merciful minimum (if he even bothered blowin' the cursed thing at all); and it appears to be about as honest an approximation of what he was having fun listening to and playing at the time as you're likely to find. \\"Nashville Skyline\\" is also a real treat!!
B004ECFW94|1.0|I dont know why anybody has not told Pl&agrave;cido what a disastrous role he is playing as a baritone in the autum of his career, a good one that should have ended more than a decade ago.  All principals here are a disaster, Morris is wobbly and never has been a true bass; Giordani bleats his way around and Pieczonka is not in a good night.  The Covent Garden DVD at least had a superb Fiesco in Furlanetto and the other two principals were good.  Please Mr. Domingo, let go of the idea of singing as a baritone which you are not, your baritone experiment is a complete failure.

B00192IV0O|5.0|So, I've always kind of liked the Black Eyed Peas & have enjoyed how their sound has evolved over the years.  I figured I'd like this album too, but I honestly LOVE this album.  I enjoy every single song on it & probably listened to it more than any other album over the past year.  It's upbeat & fun.  Most of the songs are great to work out to.  I like the robotic, futuristic type of theme to this album & the songs were really fun to hear in concert when I saw them in San Diego this last April.  I highly recommend this album.  Great job BEPs!
0060936223|4.0|While not a huge fan of Patti Smith, I picked up this book mostly because I was interested in hearing about NY in the 60's/70's. The story she tells is really fascinating, both about the \\"old New York\\" but also about her relationship with Robert Mapplethorpe and their development as artists. By the end of the book, when she writes about his death, I was sincerely moved and on the brink of tears. You really feel the connection between them, but what left me a bit cold was the fact that she basically just skipped over the time after she left NY and when he became sick. At one point she says \\"I hadn't seen or spoken to Robert in many years\\" and I just thought--really? Why? I know she got married and started her own life but it just seemed odd that they lost touch. But then again, such is life and I think that is why the book was so succesful. We can probably all relate to someone that we once had a deep connection with in our younger years who we eventually drifted apart from, but always felt a connection to.     My main complaint about the book is that it is at times a bit too \\"poetic\\", but that is to be expected considering the author. There are times where it feels as if she is trying to hard to impress the reader with an overly creative description of what should be a simple matter. But again, she is a poet so it should not be surprising. I also felt certain sections just seemed \\"enhanced\\". The story of Robert \\"saving\\" her from the creepy guy who took her out on a date just seemed a bit far fetched; as did a few of the stories about celebrities, notably Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix. And one disconnect I felt was when she became \\"famous\\"; specifically when she & Robert heard her song w/ Bruce Springsteen playing on the radio and her discussion of it making the Top 40. I never got the impression that either one of them wanted to be famous, if anything I would have thought they would have rebeled against being accepted in the mainstream as they so vigorously wanted to be \\"artists\\".     Ultimately my complaints about this book are minor and really reflect the fact that she and Robert were human and imperfect. It is a really personal story and very well told. I enjoyed it.
030746363X|5.0|Both practical and pragmatic this book is also  lot of fun to read. The energy of a younger generation can inspire us of the \\"older generation\\" and jump-start improvements we may have been procrastinating. Hope to read more from this very intersting young author!
030746363X|2.0|I found the book to be interesting, with some good take-aways but in summary it's just another diet. The great majority of diets work if followed as directed.<br />This one would work as well. It's easy to remember but that doesn't mean it's actually practical to execute.<br />For example: Rule #1: Eliminate all white carbs, including all bread, pasta and rice. This is very common in many diets since Atkins. However this is not a very convenient or easy to achieve change. At least for me, I'd rather worry about counting calories than not being able to eat a sandwich.<br />Also, I found the book very self centered. Tim Ferris definitively loves Tim Ferris. That's fine and I find him a great guy with amazing experiences. However, if the book got rid of most of the useless details about his life it would be an easier read.<br />The worse part of the book is that the actual things one must do to follow it's advice are not really summarized anywhere. They are bits and tips scattered around the book, mostly among anecdotes and justifications. This is fine but it would be better if at the end of each chapter there was a concrete summary of what to do. I guess the author is too concerned about people pirating the essence of the book.

B004HWT6DO|5.0|There's not much to dislike about this movie! It's a little confusing at first, but it has a GREAT storyline.
0385341679|5.0|I can not express how satisfying this book was. My expectations were exceeded many times over. I was engrossed, surprised, horrified, and delighted. Some great reviews already here that sum up how I feel.
B000001FXX|5.0|Probably my favorite overall Bob Marley album; toss-up between this one, Exodus and Kaya.  Actually, you can't really go wrong with Bob, but this one is outstanding.  Not a mediocre track on here, all are great.  I love the \\"older\\" sound and vibe on this one.  Any fan of Bob Marley specifically or reggae in general should have this album in their collection.  Fantastic music!
B000FBJAGE|4.0|He reveals the murderer in the second line, spoiling the plot with no warning. Like the previous reviewer, i have not read this book and will skip it for now in the hopes i forget this review in the future. Amazon please remove his review!
B002OEBMN4|3.0|As a Slayer fan since the Reign in Blood days, my favorite Slayer albums are from the period comprising Reign in Blood--> South of Heaven--> Seasons in the Abyss--> Divine Intervention.  The immediately preceding album, Hell Awaits, is quite good too, but not quite up to this level.<br /><br />I felt they lost their way a bit after this; not a lot, just a bit.  In my opinion, Diabolus, God Hates Us All, Christ Illusion, and now World Painted Blood are down a bit from that \\"classic\\" 5-star Slayer period.  Overall these most recent 4 albums seem to lack the staying power of the earlier ones (with the possible exception of Christ Illusion, which is pretty outstanding).  I can't put my finger on why I feel this way because there are some excellent individual songs on these albums.  Maybe I'm just getting older and more nostalgic...who knows.<br /><br />On a side note, I find it interesting that a lot of the Amazon reviewers complain about the production of this album and then in the same breath praise the low-budget poorly produced 80's albums like Hell Awaits, Reign in Blood, and Show No Mercy.  Doesn't make any sense.<br /><br />Finally, from reading the reviews here, it's obvious that Slayer fans are a diverse lot that possess many varying views on what they like about the band's direction and what they don't like about it.  To me, World Painted Blood is pretty much a standard 21st century Slayer release.  Not bad, but then again, not outstanding either...there are a handful of memorable tracks on here that will stand the test of time.  I give this album 3+ stars.  I want to give it 4, and maybe it will grow on me and obtain that 4th star one day, but it's not quite there yet...
B000AP04NI|5.0|I recently saw Oklahoma the Play in Washington DC and decided to get a copy of the original movie. The 50th Anniversary edition is a spectacular color copy of the original movie. I couldn't be more pleased with the image and sound quality of this CD. I gave it 5 stars and so will you if you see it.
031603438X|3.0|The die-hard Rolling Stones fan will buy this book no matter what. For everyone else, ask yourself if you have the time to wade through lots of fluff to get to the good stuff.    There are plenty of gems within this book. Some passages are laugh-out-loud funny, or delectably dishy, or genuinely insightful. But I found myself skimming large portions to get a juicy nugget. It left me with the feeling that whoever edited this was too intimidated by Keith's star power to whittle out the boring parts.    Also, as a guitarist myself, I was excited by the prospect of what some editorial reviews referred to as \\"Keef's Guitar Workshop\\" - passages in which he explained the secrets behind his technique. Unfortunately, there wasn't as much of this as I had hoped.
B002ZG980U|5.0|I loved this movie when I first saw in theaters, when I saw it again in theaters, and now that I own it on DVD. I know some people who had trouble following it, but that was part of what made it so great for me; each time I watch it, I catch more and understand more. Thus, I don't think it's a movie I'll ever tire of re-watching.   Were there some parts that didn't quite make sense and could've been explained better? Yes. But I didn't think it detracted from the overall piece at all.  If you haven't seen it yet, the only advice I can give is what I told my aunt the first time she saw it with me (after I got it on DVD), don't worry too much in the beginning, it won't make sense at first. You just have to keep watching, absorb all you can, and then watch it all come together at the end.   I, personally, love stories that twist around every which way before finally coming together and making sense at the very end, so perhaps that's why I love this movie so watch. Regardless, it's definitely a movie I think everyone should see at least once.
0783229526|4.0|The book upon which this movie is based was a classic of American 1960's literature. If you're interested in the time period and like to read, run out and get the book right now. If you prefer movies to books (no judgements), or already read the book, then this movie is a worthwhile adaptation.     Director (& screenplay co-writer) Terry Gilliam is a genius in his own right. Watching him interpret the book is a joy. The movie captures the intensity and mood of Hunter Thompson's work: hilarious in places, terrifying in others, and always surreal. It will make you want to get back in touch with your inner drug-addled anarchist.     Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro's performances are outstanding. If nothing else, the movie can be savored for those alone.
B0034G4P7Q|3.0|I don't understand all the hype that surrounds this movie.....Social Network is definitely a three stars movie. Watch it one time and forget about it.
B002H3EUA4|3.0|My husband loves this movie and was excited about getting the collectors edition, but when he opened it Christmas morning there was no hat :(
0316098337|4.0|I wasn't sure how well my attention would be held when I read that this book is told entirely from the point of view of a five-year-old. But it was so well done, and even more compelling since the voice was so innocent. I was sorry for the book to end, since I wanted to know how the future played out for Jack and Ma. But I felt the ending was exactly right, and a sequel wouldn't have the power and sense of discovery.
B000R7HY0K|3.0|Only 3 stars because the DVD did play back right, but Zoverstocks was immediately responsive and getting a refund was incredibly easy. I would definitely buy from them again!
B003UJUO54|5.0|This is another great book by Lee Child. If you are a Lee Child fan, as I am, you will enjoy the fast pace and great storyline of this book.  It was hard to put down.  Don't miss reading this great book.
1594202842|5.0|Really an excellent read. Don't let the hype scare you off. The book is honest and real and captures the author's unique cultural perspective on her own personal child-rearing experiences.
B002O1TMI4|5.0|It has been a long time since I sat down and just listened to a new album purchase all the way through. There are only 11 tracks on The Resistance, but they are simply amazing tracks. Beyond the occasional air time play on the radio, I had not heard much from this band from England. But I am most definitely a fan now. This album is a hard rocking and orchestral masterpiece. There was not a single song I did not like. Cheers to Muse for creating audible art and also to HBO for using their finale track on this album as the soundtrack to the finale of 24/7 Penguins Capitals: Road to the NHL Winter Classic which led me here.    Bottom line is if you like great music, pick up your copy of The Resistance by Muse.
B001FD5KJM|3.0|This is not a movie that you should be really pressed to see.  It's just ok.  It doesn't live up to the hype or expectations of Iron Man 1.  There's not much action, it's more about Tony and his problems...(like we all have).  Even the actions scenes are just ok.  All in all it's just OK!!  See my pattern here...(OK).
B00138CYG6|5.0|Anyone who isn't sure if they should buy this album, don't hesitate anymore. BUY IT!! Lifestylez Ov Da Poor & Dangerous is one of the best hip hop albums ever. L had such a unique lyrical style that you can't help but smile or even laugh when your brain registers what he has just said.     I listen to music excessively, and some of my favorite albums get worn out after a while; causing me to set them aside for a few months.  Lifestylez Ov Da Poor & Dangerous however is one of those special albums that NEVER gets old. I can listen to the entire album, then have it repeat and not get bored with it (I've done this many times by the way).    I've talked to people that have told me they were turned off by the production of the album. I always tell them to listen again, this time, soak up all of the lyrics and let the beats be purely complementary. When you do this you will appreciate just how lyrical L was.
1594202842|3.0|One acquaintance of mine referred this book to me as an example of how all Asian mothers raise their children. She said she would not sacrifice her children's childhood for the so-called their school success.    I hope readers will not make the same mistake as this acquaintance of mine by assuming all Asian mothers behave this way or assume this as the explanation of Asian children's success in school.    Just as you see different trees in forests, you also see different parenting styles among Asian parents. In my own experience, I talked with my children a lot more than the average parents. I reasoned with them, making them understand their status is that of a students and their main responsibility is to study well so that they can make it in society when they grow up. I have never used any harsh methods described in this book. In fact, among all my Chinese friends, I have never encountered one that ever force their children to study well but their children all excel in school.    I am afraid this book might send an inaccurable impression of Asian parents.
B0034G4P7Q|4.0|I saw The Social Network and when the movie was over, all i could think was, 'This is what the critics are freaking out about?' Now let me just say that the movie is a great one, the acting is top notch, but this movie is being very badly overrated. I can think of 5 movies off the top of my head that were better than this movie. Inception, The Kids are Alright, Black Swan, True Grit, Hell, even the latest Harry Potter was more enjoyable. Now let me just say again that i didn't completely hate the movie, it was great, but it is in no way the best movie of the year. The fact that it is being so overrated is what is making me angry.<br />Anyway, to quickly highlight the good and bad things.<br /><br />Good:<br />Jesse Eisenberg, top class acting, he stole scenes easily.<br />Score, the score was surprisingly perfect for the movie, very nicely done.<br />The rest of the cast, Justin Timberlake was awesome as Sean Parker and even though her part was small, Rashida Jones was perfect. Andrew Garfield was very good as well.<br />Screenplay, wonderful.<br /><br />Bad:<br />The movie got boring at times and I found myself yawning every once in a while, I found it hard to pay attention. Even though Jesse was acting beautifully as Mark Z, i found his character surprisingly hard to like. He acted like an ass that would make TV's  House proud, but House is funny and likable at least while he is being an ass, Mark is not. I also found that Andrew's character got on my nerves for some reason, I just found that he seemed almost whiny and annoying.<br /><br />So all in all, it is a good movie, but not the best like the so called 'critics' are saying it is.
0756404746|5.0|I read quite a lot, and fantasy in particular.  I had heard about this book from a friend some time ago, and received it for Christmas 2010.    It has been a very long time since anything in the fantasy genre has impressed me.  This book quite literally takes my breath away.  During the course of reading it, I turned to my wife and said, \\"I absolutely hate this writer. He is at the pinnacle of the craft, and I CAN'T PUT THIS BOOK DOWN.\\" I read it over the course of several evenings, mornings, and lunch breaks, and I still (two weeks after finishing it) stand in wonderment of it.  It easily stands tied for the best fantasy novel I've ever read, and possibly edges the other novel I have in mind (and, no, I'm not telling you what that other novel is).    Buy this book.  It is amazing.
030746363X|5.0|I read Tim's first book \\"The 4-Hour Work Week\\" and it revolutionized the way I did business and increased my bottom line by more than 300%.  I was skeptical when I saw that he was coming out with \\"The 4-Hour Body\\" simply because I didn't think he could top his first book. I am about 1/3 of the way through this and I am now convinced that Tim is a bonafide Bad Ass!  Looking forward to finishing the book and putting some of the \\"gurus\\" enlightened teaching into practice.  I'll let you know if my opinion changes as I get further into the book......so far though, it is highly recommended by this sophisticated redneck.
0061997811|5.0|This is the only thing that I can say about the thing... If you're a fan of the franchise and you love the concept art of the series YOU MUST HAVE THIS BOOK!
B004HAG40O|5.0|FINALLY - the Decemberists album we all knew they had in them.  Simply perfect - especially after a series of rather woolly, navel-gazing CDs.  I don't care if every track sounds as if it came off REM's Murmur/Reckoning CDs; Colin Meloy has channeled the ghost of Michael Stipe of old (with a little touch of Dylan) and re-connected with his lyrical spark. You will not be disappointed.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|As a long time Trekkie, I was leery about this movie when I first saw the trailers but am now a total fan. I give extra kudos for them actually paying attention to the original 'verse and fitting in a logical and already known way for the changes made to make it a cooler, hipper, fresher version without alienating the original fans.    And altho' I am a huge Leonard Nimoy fan, Zachary Quinto is a perfectly delectable choice  for the younger Spock. He made the role his own even when on screen with his older self. Well done!
B000EUDAWG|4.0|Product was just as advertised.  Arrived on time (although we ordered the week of Christmas) and was packaged well.  Great gag gift from grandfather to 19 year old grandson...a family tradition since grandson was little.
B00005K3OT|5.0|I ordered this movie the week before Christmas, and was alerted that it may arrive after Christmas, which was not a problem, given the season.  And just as alerted, the movie came the week after Christmas.  Even though it was a used purchase, it arrived in good condition and was viewable. It was a Christmas gift for my sister, who was pleased to receive it.    Thank you,  Andrea Daniel
B003EI2EH2|3.0|In the kindle edition, it is hard to ascertain if you are reading all the parts that you are supposed to for whatever \\"fix\\" you're after.  So I am not sure if I finished the book, and don't have any way of measuring (big concept in this book) my progress with the book itself.  Anyway, love the bingeing option in the diet, but easy to follow if you are a bachelor.  When you have a family and employees who eat at your house, then its really hard to get it all organized.  (everyone else is having grilled cheese...why can't I?).  I think the best advice in the book is keeping your science current and always measure, this is key.  I can't get a proper fat measurement though, my gym doesn't have any tools and this hurts my chance for success with this book; I only need to lose about \\"5 pounds\\" total, but how do I figure out what is muscle weight gain and what is fat weight loss?  I am already a competitive sportswoman, need more than four hours per month in the gym for my sport.  Interesting what he says about over-training.  Will have to think about that.  I think the self observations are a little over-the-top, but necessary for the format of the book.  So, I am finished with the book (I guess?) and not sure what to do now!  Can I really get away with 80 seconds a week with the kettlebell?  Is that what he suggests, I am not sure... I am not clear what the \\"plan\\" is after all this...
0452295548|4.0|Taylor's book is truly in-sight and in-side ful, as she is a neuroanatomist. Much of the book is repetitive technical information BUT, the insights Taylor shares about the process of the stroke and her recovery make the book definitely worth reading. I would guess there is no other book like this on the market, given Taylor's training and experience. Her emphasis on the power of the two sides of the brain is fascinating.  Academic culture tends to stress left brain work and at least in my case forced me to develop that side more. Taylor's experience during recovery of being right brained is revelatory.
0316098337|5.0|This read is amazing!!! I am a mother of a young boy myself and this book moved me 100%. I couldn't put the book down, and was on pins and needles. Through tears and smiles this book is well worth the read. Enjoy!!
B002N5N4M6|5.0|AWESOME show. I got an awesome deal on this set when I purchased it @$12.87. After I received package and confirmed quality, I went to purchase another for a gift. The price was more than doubled. Trust this vendor, but lesson learned...  get the deals when offered.
0060555661|5.0|This is probably the best place to start if you are interested in value investing. Although the latest revision by Graham was in the seventies, Jazon Zweig adds commentaries to each chapter to bring the information right up to date. The principles of investment are sound and the style of writing is very accessible. This is a classic investment book and should be read by most people planning for their financial future. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I loved this series, and thought the final book was great (even if we had to wait a VERY long time)...    There were lots of surprises and I was very satisfied with how she finished the book.  As another reviewer said, it's hard to talk about it without revealing anything, so I won't.  Enjoy!!!
1401307450|5.0|I have never read a book where the phrase sex, drugs and rock 'n roll have been more appropriate! This is an extremely readable book that will have you engrossed until the end, which won't take long as you can't help but read, read, read until it is finished. It has all the info on the Red Hot Chilli Peppers formation and line-up changes over the years, as well as great stories of Anthony's growing up and battles with drugs. A brilliant biography.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B0037KMHRY|3.0|This soundtrack makes for epic driving music, but, sadly, I can't use it for anything else- my Macbook Pro's cd drive won't read it because it's a black disk (think PS1 games), so I can't rip it. Even though I bought the disk legally, in order to listen to the music at home, I'm going to have to pirate it.
B0016BWACI|5.0|This is a magical fairytale for kids and adult alike. You cannot beat Henson productions for imagination and the wonderful puppetry. The puppets are infused with such character that you forget that they are controlled by puppeteers and see them as living things. The story is the usual triumph of good over evil, but who doesn't like that, especially on a Sunday afternoon with a bucket of popcorn! A brilliant film that has to be seen by all.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|I bought the Toy Story DVD for a Christmas present for my 22 month old grandson.  He loves it.  He tells him mommy - Toy Story, please mommy.
B000KGGIQY|5.0|This is quite simply a brilliant film, with superb performances by Phoenix and Wetherspoon. I knew nothing about Johnny Cash before this film, but feel I've come away with some understanding of the man as well as a real appreciation of his music. This follows his life up until he married June Carter and explores his childhood, first marriage, rise to the top of the music industry and his struggles with drug abuse. The music is great and makes for an excellent introduction to Johnny Cash's work. This film kept me interested the whole way through, and left me wanting to find out more. This is also well worth a viewing even if you know nothing of Cash or aren't a big fan of country music, it can be watched as a human interest story in it's own right, but you will leave it captivated by the man. Simply excellent!<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B0040QYROA|5.0|This is the 3rd version of this pioneering Sci-Fi flick I now own and I am still awed by the advanced photographic techniques, visual composition and creative imagination born full blown from the brain of director Fritz Lang. Anyone who cares about the history of motion pictures should have this 'complete' version in his/her collection.
0060730552|4.0|'Touching the Void' is a book of two halves. The first half is about Simon and Joe's climb up the mountain and how they coped with various conditions and the second half follows what happens after Joe's accident and how they both get off the mountain. Taking this into account, the second half is far superior to the first. Initially the book seemed a touch dry, with lots of climbing specific jargon and rather flat story telling, but then the accident occurs and you are plunged headlong into their fight for survival and the writing leaps up about a hundred notches and becomes highly descriptive and emotive. You really feel your emotions go through the wrangler as Joe recounts his story and you feel for him every step of the way. By the end you feel emotionally overwrought and (almost) as exhausted as him as he describes his final journey back to camp. There are some excellent colour plates in this book, as well as an additional chapter when Joe goes back to the site of the accident many years later. What starts off as a dry uninspiring read becomes an account of a highly charged fight for survival and you understand why this has become a climbing classic. Well worth a read if you like this kind of book, I'd also suggest 'Into Thin Air' By John Krakauer which is another excellent climbing book.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B003L20IFQ|4.0|Oh my goodness, I've watched a few horror movies in my time, but seriously this takes the cake for me. Most horror movies are so unrealistic that although it is scary you can get up at the end and walk away. Claustaphobia is real as well as the plot, given that Americans are not liked in Iraq and civilian workers have been taken hostage and murdered. At the end of this movie, I just sat there for 3 minutes watching the screen hoping that after the credits there would be a great surprise ending. Well surprise! Now although Reynolds acting was superb, had it been great acting by an unknown actor, it would have scare me more. It would have been too possible.
B000FBJAOG|5.0|I will pursue more works from this author.  First book I've actually completed in about 10 years...voluntarily.  A fun, chilling, thought provoking read.  Loved it on the iPad.
0618154248|5.0|I bought these for my baby who just turned one. He doesn't know how to read yet, so I get to enjoy them first! I think once he knows the meaning of words he will really enjoy the stories as well.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|What can I say I have watched the 13 episodes and extras twice and each time I watch I see something I missed. This series has all you could want on cable tv. It has sex and nudity, great fight scenes,blood and gore as well as an interwoven plot.      The extras included are good as well.  I hope the lead character,, Andy Whitfield can return for the 2nd season.  Meanwhile a 6 episode prequel is starting.    I rate it 5 stars and I would say buy it!!!    If you liked 300, Gladiator and other epics  you will not be disappointed
B00488I8O0|5.0|Motorhead are a band that rarely disapoint. I may be in the minority that thinks that Kiss of Death (2006) was awful but other than that, even at their most mediocre Motorhead have been jolly good. In their now 35 years of rocking and rolling, Motorhead have released several stone cold classic albums. The last of these being Inferno, in my view... until now. The World is Yours might be the best Motorhead album in 15 or 20 years and there is some mighty competition in that time period (1916, Bastards, Overnight Sensation, Inferno). It's ultimately pointless trying to decide whether it tops those classic albums, it is simply another great Motorhead album and, to me anyway, a legitimate return to form. Returning to form is something Motorhead are accused of every 4 to 5 years or so, whenever the media decide that it's time to give them some credit again.    The great thing about the World is Yours is incredibly catchy. Motorhead haven't sounded this melodic since Bastards. Almost every song has a killer chorus. What is also noticable is that the music is predominantly on the rock n roll side of the fence with the more heavy metal leanings eschewed somewhat. Lemmy will rarely acknowledge that Motorhead play heavy metal but although based in rock n roll roots, Motorhead have cetainly had an equal portion of heavy metal thrown into the mix in the Mikkey Dee days. Not so much on this record. Maybe Born to Lose and certainly Brotherhood of Man (very much like Orgasmatron) are metal but the rest is pure dirty rock n roll with great melodies.    Stand out tracks:  I Know How to Die  Get Back in Line  Outlaw  Rock and Roll Music    No bad songs on here at all. Nothing to skip.    I always like to think that there are 8 essential Motorhead albums from throughout their career. Albums that truly represent the cream of their studio output. These albums also conveniently cover all the line ups which itself is testament to the band's quality. They are Overkill, Ace of Spades, Another Perfect Day, Orgasmatron, 1916, Bastards, Overnight Sensation and Inferno. The World is Yours is getting added to that list.
B003ASLJO0|5.0|Gran Torino shows how two teenaged Hmong immigrants are able to reach a racist Vietnam veteran and change his life, helping him to overcome the anguish he suffered from the war as he saves their lives and the community.
B003DZX44I|2.0|Referring to the DVD only, I did not like the color.  Everything seemed to be overly reddened.  Belle's dress, which was blue in the original, had a red tinge.  Her hair, which was brown in the original, was red.  It was as if they had painted over everything in red when they restored it.    The story and the film are great and the music is fantastic.  They could have done a better job of restoring it.
0634022296|4.0|This book is a great start for learning the Beatles. The 192 included songs are listed mostly alphabetically by name with the keys of each chord and \\"chord symbol\\" boxes for each song. For the most part the chording is simplified for the intermediate guitarist, but very close to the sound on the albums. Many songs require a capo to be in-tune with the album. While some people don't like to use the capo, this book does make it possible to play most of the Beatles songs without having to re-tune your guitar. I found the book overall really easy to use, and the small size makes it practical to bring on trips.<br /><br />One of the drawbacks is that this book lacks of any rhythm notation, licks, or other musical notation. Since most of the Beatles' songs have unusual rhythm parts, you will probably need to search for the songs on YouTube in order to figure them out. It would have been super if they had thought to include the main guitar riffs in tab notation, but they didn't.<br /><br />Another drawback is the sloppy order of the songs in the book. It would have been much better to have grouped the songs by album, or to have them ALL alphabetically ordered. Instead, 95% of the songs are in alphabetical order with the other 5% seemingly randomly placed. Despite this mess, I still recommend the book.
B000HEWEEY|4.0|This is a great movie.  The quality of the DVD was very good.  The special features were interesting.  I would recommend buying this film.
0563529288|5.0|This is a really great box set.. the character voices are great there is background noise and music that makes the book come alive. the only problem i found was that this is not a recording of someone reading the book... its a dramatization.. and \\"reads\\" much like a movie. in fact, all of the cd's are 2 hours and 30 minutes long.. I wonder just how much was cut out.... Looks like i will have to find another recording so I can get all of what Pullman wrote and not some version that has been edited for time.
B000LXHK2C|3.0|When I first saw this DVD box and saw that Ridley Scott was the producer, I thought....\\"no, that can't be\\".  But to my surprise this is definitely a Ridley Scott production.  There aren't any big battles or extravagant costumes.  This is plain and simple romance, further enhanced by the beautiful scenery but it is predictable as most romantic comedies are.  This is a genre I wasn't expecting from Scott, but he did a great job.  The cinematography was great as were the actors and script.  There were some funny moments but lacked any deep emotional scenes.  It really is a basic \\"safe\\" romantic comedy.<br /><br />The second thing that caught my eye was the fact it stared Russell Crow.  The bad boy of the outback playing a \\"know-it-all\\" stock broker from London who gets wooed into the wine maker lifestyle.  Crow did a wonderful job and I was pleasantly surprised by his range here.  His portrayal of snobby money maker turned humbled wine maker was fun to watch.  It seemed like he was having fun with the role and that showed in his performance.  The stunning Marion Cotillard plays Crow's love interest and she is as beautiful as ever.  How could you not want to stay in France with a dame like that by your side?<br /><br />My favorite thing about this film and production was the music.  The soundtrack was a home run, including tracks from Josephine Baker, Franz Ferdinand and The Everly Brothers.  Sadly, the official soundtrack CD is missing some of the best songs from the movie.  I thoroughly enjoyed the French music as well and they were all partnered perfectly with the situations playing on screen.<br /><br />\\"A Good Year\\", as I said before, is simple.  There is no complexity to the story, it is straight forward and doesn't pretend to be anything it is not.  For me, I like films with more depth, but for what it was I enjoyed this movie.  My wife seemed to really like it as well if that says anything for it.<br /><br />[...]

B0048LPRD2|4.0|Gaspar No&eacute; has created his most ambitious journey with the latest addition to his already stellar filmography. No&eacute;'s new film \\"Enter The Void\\" explores what happens when you die and attempts to bring the audience into the \\"psychedelic\\" and near/post death experience. While this is his most technologically impressive and aspiring film it is not his best. In fact, it is the worst of his catalog but that isn't to say it is bad, it's just not as incredible as his other films. No&eacute; has stated this film was inspired by psychedelic experiences and the \\"Tibetan Book of The Dead\\" which discusses the death experience including re-birth. He even traveled to the Amazon to experience one of the most powerful psychedelics known, \\"Ayahuasca\\". No&eacute; laughingly stated this was for \\"professional research\\".<br /><br />Newcomer Nathanial Brown plays \\"Oscar\\", an American 20 something living in Tokyo trying to make ends meet by selling drugs. Him and his sister \\"Linda\\" played by a sultry Paz De la Huerta are orphans from a horrific car crash when they were children. Oscar has a slight obsession with breasts, psychedelic drugs, and inappropriate relationships; including one with his sister. The story is told in three parts, first showing Oscar's point of view as he takes DMT and deals drugs. Second, we are in the POV of Oscar's soul after being shot, re-living the events leading up to his demise. In this section, we learn that he has managed to move his sister out to Tokyo where she has becomes a stripper. We witness the car crash that took their parents and learn about his \\"awkward\\" relationship with Linda. Third, we see Oscar's soul traveling the city watching over his sister as he promised her that he will \\"never leave her\\". The ending is ambiguous, but most of his films are; though for the first time that I know of, he revealed in a few interviews big hints as to what really happens. So be careful if you are reading interviews prior to watching the film.<br /><br />As with most of No&eacute;'s films, ETV attempts to alter the viewer's perception through the use of sound and visuals. \\"I Stand Alone\\" and \\"Irreversible\\" were both filmed in this way and both managed to completely engross me into the characters psyche. In \\"Enter The Void\\", No&eacute; attempts this right off the bat in the opening credit sequence. He uses an industrial trance song from the England techno group \\"LFO\\". Partnered with pulsating lights and text, he essential brings the audience into a psychedelic \\"trip\\". Some will be immediately turned off by this beginning sequence as it is almost seizure inducing but those who stick it out are in for a treat. The soundtrack was an integral part as well. There was music, but mostly it was background noise and what I think was Binaural Tones. Binaural Tones or Beats are low frequency sounds meant to alter the brain waves in an effort to change perception. If there is any truth to this phenomenon, I think the audience experiences it first hand while watching.<br /><br />Noe uses the same technique as he did in \\"Irreversible\\" having the camera float above and transition through solid objects. This was one of the few things I didn't like about the movie. I felt like I had seen it before and that he wasn't presenting anything new. The floating aside, he did managed to show me something I have never seen before. The POV technique. I couldn't believe what I was watching when Oscar was standing in the mirror washing his face. The camera blacked out perfectly in sync with when Oscar puts his hands over his eyes. It was fascinating to watch, in fact there are many camera shots in the film that left my jaw dropped.<br /><br />The script was great but some of the performances were not. I was surprised by this since all of his previous films were incredibly acted. No&eacute; stated in an interview that there was a lot of improvisation on set in regards to the script. I can't help but think maybe this had something to do withthe poor acting. I suppose the improvisation helped the film seem more real, but it just felt forced. One standout for me was the actress who plays the younger version of Linda. Emily Alyn Lind sent chills down my spine with her portrayal of a child witnessing her parents horrific death.<br /><br />Another surprising, but welcome change is that this movie wasn't very violent. Pretty much all of No&eacute;'s previous feature films scared the hell out of me. This trip was different, though he still featured graphic sex as he tends to do in all of his films. But this movie isn't about sex and violence. At it's heart it is about the unknown (death) and shows the collective experience of many people over many centuries (psychedelics). Early in the film Oscars friend \\"Alex\\", played by Cyril Roy, mentions that the chemical in with DMT and Ayahuasca is in the human body already. He says that when you die the DMT is released essentially giving you the \\"hardest trip\\" you can get. My theory is that Noe wanted to show the effect of taking DMT recreationally (Oscar's first person view of a DMT trip early in the film) and the effect of DMT naturally occurring at the moment of death. A brilliant concept that he pulled off flawlessly.<br /><br />As with most of his films, this is not for everyone. You have to be able to appreciate the craft of movie making to really understand the technical accomplishment this film was. Some critics have said this is \\"style over substance\\", but I disagree. The film has its faults, yes, but it is enjoyable and captivating. I've never seen anything like it and honestly probably never will. Gaspar No&eacute; is one of the best directors in the world today, I can't wait to see what he thinks up next.<br /><br />[...]l, but it just felt forced.

B0025KVLV0|4.0|This is a solid album. Not the best Beatles album, but it is still enjoyable. Highlights include Two of Us, I've Got a Feeling, and Let it BE.
B00009W0U4|4.0|One of my favorite directors of all time and one of my favorite movies. \\"Irreversible\\" is an experience unlike any other. Gaspar Noe uses reverse-chronological story telling to give us one of the most visceral and frightening encounters you are ever likely to have in the Cinema. The film is beautifully shot and intensely acted. \\"Irreversible\\" is Noe's first use of the floating camera technique that he also used in the 2009 film \\"Enter The Void\\", another roller-coaster of a film. Not surprisingly, this film is not for everyone. It is widely known as one of the most difficult movies to watch due to the graphic violence and long rape scene so be warned. But it is not just a shock film, it has an important message about relationships and how the decisions we make ultimately decide our fate.<br /><br />The story involves a couple played by Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel who after a heated argument split ways for the evening. Alex, played by Bellucci, gets fed up with her boyfriend Marcus (Cassel) and leaves the safety of her friends to go home. A decision we eventually find out is a near fatal one. Marcus finds out that his love has been brutally raped and beaten on her way home. This sends him into a rage of revenge and he will not stop until he finds the one responsible. Along the way Marcus' best friend and Alex's former lover tries to convince him to leave it be so he won't do something he will regret. As you can imagine, he is unsuccessful.<br /><br />\\"Irreversible\\" starts at the end of the story and ends at the beginning, much like the movie \\"Memento\\" by Christopher Nolan. A decision that could have gone either way. Most people like the reverse story telling, I think it could have gone either way. Gaspar Noe is known to push the limits and make his audience as uncomfortable as he can by graphically presenting topics that are hard to witness and think about. In this outing he decides to hit you with the heaviest scenes in the beginning and middle of the movie then ending with the character development. Thankfully, the third act was designed to slowly bring the audience back from the horror they have just seen. By the end you have (slightly) come to terms with the earlier terror and you are left with an array of emotions.<br /><br />The production team Noe surrounds himself with are some of the best in the business. \\"Irreversible\\" is a marvel of film making using dreary soundtracks and showcasing the seedy underbelly of France. As mentioned before the use of the floating camera is outstanding; a major challenge since it was filmed using cables suspended in the air. It's as if you are on a ride, one that you want to get off but can't; the ultimate \\"fly on the wall\\" experience.<br /><br />\\"Irreversible\\" was filmed with a loose script and literally no dialogue. In fact, the infamous rape scene was essentially free-form by Bellucci and La Tenia, the antagonist played by Jo Prestia. Gaspar used one long take from a fixed camera to film this scene which made a huge impact. It caused the viewer to believe they are witnessing an actual rape on camera. It truly is the most difficult scene I have ever witnessed. Many people walked out due to this scene during the premier, cursing the director. Noe, however, loves to get these reactions as it shows his goal to push the boundaries was successful. Cassel and Bellucci have amazing chemistry (it helps they are actually married). Bellucci is as beautiful as ever and Cassel presents an intensity rarely seen from actors. I think having his wife presented with such a horrific experience pushed him further. Pretty much all of the other characters were cast with unknowns or people that haven't acted at all which pushed the realism.<br /><br />It has been over a year since my first viewing of this film and I still think about it. \\"Irreversible\\" is not a film that can easily be watched over and over and probably shouldn't be. Afterward you feel drained, angry, sad and confused. Confused because you aren't sure whether you just watched one of the worst or best films ever made. If you are up for the challenge, I highly recommend giving this a shot, but be warned it's not for the faint of heart.<br /><br />[...]one of the worst or best films ever made.

B00003CXCT|5.0|This box set is simply epic! Forget what all the star wars nut cases are saying...the DVD's are great and the quality is pretty frickin awesome since the movie came out in the late 70s and 80s. Cant go wrong here.
B003Y5H4SO|2.0|Another fantasy horror for adults from writer M. Night Shyamalan. Unfortunately, this movie falls into the same traps as most of his other films. There was promise with this film, I was hoping for something different, something tense and scary with an unexpected twist. This is not what I got. I was a fan of \\"Signs\\", \\"Unbreakable\\", \\"The Sixth Sense\\" and even \\"Lady In The Water\\". These films had great actors and scripts along with good production values. \\"Devil\\" had some good actors, some not, the script was laughable and the story had gigantic plot holes. M. Night can think up some great themes but ultimately fails to portray them on screen. Granted, he wasn't the director in this outing, so I can't fault him completely. Director John Erick Dowdle did not impress me and I suspect M. Night was probably breathing down his neck during production.<br /><br />The premise is that a group of characters with their own dark secrets all get trapped in an elevator while the Devil torments them and begins killing them off. While all of this mayhem is taking place in the elevator, a detective and religious security guard watch from the control room trying to figure out who in the lift is killing everyone.<br /><br />What worked? Well, there were only a few things. The score was great. Composer Fernando Velazquez created a haunting atmosphere and was probably the highlight of the film for me. I generally dislike a lot of music in horror movies, but this proves that if well done it can be very effective. The tension was also there, though, it was broken up too often by switching to the control room during some of the most tense moments. Lastly, the cinematography was pretty good. Keeping the action to a confined space was a huge part of the story obviously and Tak Fujimoto did a really good job with the lighting and camera angles.<br /><br />My biggest problem with this film are the holes in the story. I won't point them out here, but you will ultimately find them. It is really disappointing because this topic/story had potential. M. Night needs to have more people reviewing his work prior to production pointing out the holes. I can't help but think this film would have been a huge success had it been in the hands of a different director and script writer. Michael Haneke for instance would have been a perfect fit for this. \\"Devil\\" also tried too hard to foreshadow without giving away the mystery. We are told numerous times throughout the film how the Devil works, such as taking human form, killing those who get in his way, etc. These hints made the ending much less effective. I also was really upset at the title/credit sequences. I realize these are not that big of a deal, but in \\"Devil\\" these scenes were meant to be symbolic. Unfortunately they were one of the most cheesy I've seen in a long time.<br /><br />I could really go on and on about the things that went wrong in this film but who wants to read all of that? Just know that if you want an interesting concept you will find it here. If you want an enjoyable and well made film, you may want to go elsewhere.topic/story had potential. M.

B004927I50|3.0|The evolution of country music into an alternate genre where its songs get radio-play has often been ridiculed - after all, we've had such pop-candy stalwarts such as Shania Twain, Carrie Underwood, and even Faith Hill to cite as examples. But Taylor Swift is a definitive example of the broadening of country music - to include influences such as rock and bluegrass, so much so that the `country' aspect of it is thoroughly diluted. It is with this palette that Swift has created \\"Speak Now\\", a decidedly inferior followup to her breakthrough album \\"Fearless\\", only because it's a very obvious sellout (much in the vein of Shania Twains \\"Up\\", but at least on that CD Shania had the decency to release separate albums for the pop, world, and country audiences - a feat that's never been replicated since).<br /><br />While \\"Fearless\\" wore its heart on its sleeve in an off-handed manner, \\"Speak Now\\" is more pointed and unnecessarily vicious. What seemed like innocent schoolgirl rants on \\"Fearless\\" have evolved into worrisome, even deranged complaints by a woman who is now well in her twenties. Prime amongst these is \\"Dear John\\" about John Mayer. Granted, I have no real fondness for Mayer either as a musician or as a personality of any sort, but how anyone could deserve such an accusatory track dedicated to them is beyond me. Ironically, this is the best track on the entire album - from a musical perspective - and if you can ignore the `woe is me' lyrics, there is much to enjoy here (let us pretend not to notice the absolute lack of chord progression on this song, but then again, any musician will tell you that all of Swifts songs are written in the `key of flat', so no surprises there).<br /><br />The innate issue with an album of this sort is that you get into it expecting more of the same that you saw on her earlier work, but the sheen has worn off, and the results aren't exactly pretty. Lead single \\"Mine\\", which seemed to me a stellar first single especially due to its lyrics on the chorus, ironically stalled at No. 2 on the Country Charts and didn't give Taylor the No. 1 Billboard Country Songs ribbon that she'd wanted. It was widely expected that this song would do that, but it didn't. Second single \\"Back to December\\" is interesting only because Swift appears to be taking the blame on this (rather than constantly blaming everyone else, which, lets be honest, is her musical forte!), but the verse-chorus-verse here is rather listenable and you might find yourself singing along to this on the radio. However, for every listenable track here, there are tons of rather poorly constructed and ill-performed numbers that go literally nowhere. \\"Mean\\" for example is meant to address a particular media journalist but ends up as rather tacky and in sad taste. The same can be said of the faux-rock mood of \\"The Story of Us\\" which was a very weak melody to begin with. These problems were not apparent on \\"Fearless\\" where even random album tracks such as \\"Youre not sorry\\" could have been potential hit singles.<br /><br />The other issue is that \\"Speak Now\\" is front-loaded with all its potential hits and the `big songs', leading to the album falling to pieces in the second half. This is unfortunate because they were really onto something with the first half, at least in terms of scoring some radio airplay or replays on CD. I cant imagine anyone wanting to listen to \\"Innocent\\" (her very shoddy critique of the entire Kanye West episode) more than once, and \\"Never Grow Up\\" is just too easy. If you were expecting Swift to bring her A game and revolutionize country music, this is not the album you should be looking at. A quick glance at some other reviews will all give added points to packaging rather than quality. For example, one reviewer calls this the `best packaged CD of the last ten years' because of the cover art, inclusion of lyrics, and superior artwork. Point noted, but honestly, aren't we supposed to judge a music CD based on the actual music rather than the packaging? Or is that the state of current country music where an album cover makes the CD get an extra star? The last two songs on this album, especially \\"Long Live\\", are very much culled from demos and quickly recorded - and the impact they make is just as temporary and fleeting.<br /><br />The Deluxe Edition of this CD gets you six bonus tracks (3 new songs, two acoustic versions and a remix). \\"Superman\\", while interesting, should have made the lead edition of the album instead of the Deluxe as its obviously leaps and bounds over anything else on the Deluxe bonus CD. However, if you try comparing this to \\"Fearless\\", you will find that the deluxe edition is nowhere as great as that one (remember it contained tons of videos on the bonus DVD as well as some killer bonus tracks). Still, I suppose the effort is appreciated. \\"Speak Now\\" debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 Albums Chart, and broke records as it sold a million copies in the first week. Sales-wise, that is extremely impressive, but its not quite deserved, I think. There are ideas here, thoughts with some backbone, but their delivery is just not up to the mark, and while Taylor as a vocalist has definitely made strides (check out her crystal clear voice on \\"Dear John\\", which remains the album highlight), she needs to record better material. Also, this album would have been a whole lot better had they paid more attention to the entire second half of the record, which to me is virtually unlistenable. For those of you who think that comparisons to \\"Fearless\\" are uncalled for, well, it did win Album of the Year at the Grammys, so that's saying something, and does raise the benchmark pretty high. \\"Speak Now\\" just can't reach those heights though.<br /><br />Taylor Swift remains a reasonably talented singer (though not a country singer), and I must say that if I had to compare her two other contemporary country singers - Carrie Underwood & Miranda Lambert, she comes across as third on the list. Carrie's last album \\"Play On\\" is definitely notches better than \\"Speak Now\\" (hey, at least it was a `country' album), but Miranda Lambert currently rules the country roost for me with 2010's spectacular \\"Revolution\\". Comparing that exceptional album to Swifts new one is like comparing Chateaubriand steak to a Kit-Kat. Swift is out of her league on that one. But, shes still young and has a decent voice, so lets hope she finally records a proper country album some day (like perhaps \\"Theres More Where That Came From\\" by Lee Ann Womack. Now that's country!)<br /><br />Three Stars. An average effort at best; and if you strip away the media-machine and PR, the music just doesn't cut it.is that the state of current country music where an album cover makes the CD get an extra star?

0385341679|4.0|I have been enthralled with this series since I picked up the first book, Darkfever.  It is a completely addictive and extremely well written series overall, but as far as an ending goes, it's not as clever or tied together as what I think we were hoping for in a 5 year commitment wrap up.  It certainly has its measure of twists and turns but for the most part, it's actually a lot of the same we've read in the four previous books. Although our heroine, MacKayla Lane, grows and changes much throughout, the results of those changes are not anything that gets us rallied and cheering her on.  She continues down her path of stubbornness and cluelessness, except this time around she doesn't care that she is.  In the four stages of competency she moves from unconscious incompetent to conscious incompetent.  She knows what she doesn't know and that's enough for her.  My expectation was that she would graduate to at least the competent levels, and not knowing is not what I wanted as a reader.     If you've been hanging on, literally, from the cliffhanger that was Dreamfever to find out what happens, Shadowfever starts with what I felt was the best part of the entire book.  Mac learns who the Beast is and the grief she feels over her loss is so well told that you just feel it in your gut and now that it's too late, Mackayla truly starts growing up.  The lesson of \\"don't listen to what people say, listen to what they do, actions speak louder than words, resonates.  She gets it!  Finally!  But no, she doesn't get it and the rest of the book falls right back into the same untrusting angst which completely blew my mind.  No big, so many pages to go so much can happen and it does.  There are many reveals and ah ha moments, some straight forward and some you wouldn't guess in a million years, but through it all, it lacked emotional development that would make this a truly spectacular novel.      High level synopsis if you haven't read the previous books, some nine months earlier, Mackayla Lane came to Dublin to find out who killed her sister and to get revenge on her murderer.  What she finds is a world filled with unique creatures, death, hidden agendas and destruction that only she can help temper.  She can't do what she needs to alone so she finds herself working alongside a buffet of shady characters that she can't trust but also can't walk away from.    If you think this is the game changing finale that brings hope for the future, a sigh for the romance, the smile for the triumph, etc... think again.  The events we all care about methodically take place, so satisfying an expectation in one way, but the journey getting there was hollow and often emotionally stinted where it was such a big deal for it to happen, but when it did, it was a let down.      There's nothing about this that strikes the reader as Happily Ever After and perhaps there's a good reason for that. There is a spin off series to come out that's tied to this world.  There are still plenty of things that need resolution, and although we knew Mackayla is epic, she can't or rather shouldn't do anything with that power.  So in terms of what happens in Shadowever, you won't be disappointed.  In terms of how it happens, you would probably have a few things you would change.

0307473708|4.0|It is rare in fiction that, when met with a serial killer, we find ourselves not only liking the individual but hoping that he will succeed. Anyone who says this can't be done has obviously not read Jeff Lindsay's \\"Darkly Dreaming Dexter\\". The book centers around Dexter Morgan, a blood-spatter analyst for the Miami Police Department.    Tramautized by an Event as a child, Dexter has a secret hobby: at night, he sometimes goes out and kills people. Not just anyone, mind you - he is careful to only kill bad people. He feels a need to feed his hobby, and at an attempt to be human (and the influence of his late foster father, Harry), he knows that this will do the least amount of damage.    Things are going well until a serial killer turns up in Miami. This individual is murdering prostitutes and then draining the blood from the corpses. However, unlike other cases, which Dexter can identify with due to his \\"hobby\\", this one is different. He feels a connection with the killer, can almost anticipate the murder's next move, and even has dreams about the crimes - before they are discovered.    Are Dexter and the new Miami serial killer one and the same? In an intriguing journey in the mind of an almost-human, we watch him struggle with what he feels, what he knows is right, and his sanity. A perfect blend of dark humor, humanity, and action, \\"Darkly Dreaming Dexter\\" is an interesting and unusual read.

In my opinion Ender's Game is my second favorite book that I have ever read.(first would have to come Speaker of The Dead, which is book 2 in the Ender series) I also would never expected that it would have been that great of a book, especially since I used to be the person who would break that rule by judging a book by its cover. But yes, in a total-Ender's Game did captivate me.   Ender's Game was set in a world where Earth was at war with the buggers (Earth has defeated the buggers twice, but they also did it at a great payment) and this time they couldn't afford to lose. Audacious characters, a page-turning plot, and a relatable theme made Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game a fascinating, breathtaking, novel that I didn't put down from start to finish!
0471463396|5.0|Greenwald, Kahn et al. did a good job putting this book together. His approach works and is easy to use. I would also suggest purchasing his other book [[ASIN:1591841801 Competition Demystified: A Radically Simplified Approach to Business Strategy]], as it provides updates to some parts of Value Investing.     Once you're done reading those two books my suggestion would be to read [[ASIN:0071628185 Applied Value Investing: The Practical Application of Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett's Valuation Principles to Acquisitions, Catastrophe Pricing and Business Execution]]. Calandro uses the valuation techniques learned in Value Investing on specific company cases and his book should be used as a workbook to Value Investing.     enjoy!
0765326353|4.0|During his teenage years, when Brandon Sanderson was in college working on his writing and looking to make it as an author, in the back of his mind a story idea formed and began to germinate and develop and become more and more complex.  Over a decade later, with Sanderson firmly established as one of the most important, bestselling fantasy writers being published today, he has now turned his story idea that was a dream into a reality in The Way of Kings, the first book of the Stormlight Archive.    Epic fantasy story aside, the book itself is a work of art: beautiful maps on the inside covers, further maps and illustrations and drawings throughout the lengthy book as relates to the story, illustrations for each chapter title, and a captivating cover by artist Michael Whelan.  Another part of the dream come true for Sanderson is the allowance of the publisher Tor to publish a book weighing in at 1008 pages; it indicates Tor has full confidence in the book and in Sanderson.    Sanderson begins the book with description into the important history of this world.  Long ago there was a mighty war between the Voidbringers and the knights known as Radiants who used a special kind of armor known as Shardplates and their weapons were the unstoppable Shardblades - \\"A Shardblade did not cut flesh; it severed the soul itself\\" - but then the Radiants turned against mankind and abandoned them, leaving their armor and weapons.  We turn to the present day, thousands of years later to the Shattered Plains: a harsh and horrific landscape where armies battle the enemy for domination, with the goal of securing more Shardplates and Shardblades.  Then there are the Chasmfiends, great, destructive, terrifying beasts that they also fight to kill, for deep within their crustacean bodies lie the priceless gemhearts.    Our story focuses on two characters.  One is Kaladin, a young man in his twenties who has seen much of life already.   Raised by his surgeon father to become a brilliant doctor, he instead turns to the life of a warrior, with hopes of getting his hands on a Shardblade, and soon sees his fair share of death and bloodshed.  Now he is a slave, for reasons unknown, with little to hope for in life.  He soon becomes a member of the bridge crew, a group of slaves whose job it is to carry a giant, heavy bridge across great distances and to lay it across the chasms to allow the soldiers to cross and attack the enemy.  Kaladin becomes part of bridge team four, which is renowned for losing the most lives each time it races into battle.  Kaladin finds a unique luck on his side, as he manages to continue to survive, and then chooses to work for his team, train them, create survival tactics for them, and he discovers something he thought he'd lost for good: hope and his will to live.    Then there is Shallan, a young woman whose family has fallen on hard times after the death of their father.  The family is in possession of a Soulcaster, a unique magical device that can essentially create just about anything out of nothing, only now it is broken.  However, Shallan has a plan: to become the ward and student for Jasnah Kolin, sister of King Elhokar of Althekar, with plans to replace Jasnah's Soulcaster with her own; her only problem is she has no idea how to use it.    While a thousand pages may have been a little too much for Sanderson to tell the stories he wanted to tell in this first volume of the projected ten-book series, as some story lines drag a little before something happens, Sanderson has nevertheless done what he does best: created a truly unique fantasy world that at times feels as complete and complex as our own.  There is the class system of eye color with darkeyes, who are looked down upon, and lighteyes who are the only ones who may bear Shardblades (though there are hints that this is not set in stone).  There is the important religion of the Vorin which most of the known world follows, which tells of the struggle between the Voidbringers and humanity; while some other religions are hinted at; and then there is Jasnah Kolin, an atheist and decreed a heretic, who is a most unique and fascinating character.  A number of interludes throughout the book help to introduce some minor characters to explore some more of this overwhelming world, such as Szeth-son-son-Vallano, who is an assassin from the land of Shinovar, possessing a unique magic to flip gravity around.  And then there are the spren, which are spirits that seem to be caused by or drawn to specific happenstances and emotions, such as fear, pain, music, rot, and glory to name a few.  Little is known or understood of the spren, other than they exist, while Kaladin finds himself befriending a specific spren that seems to be evolving.    One would think that much could be told in a thousand pages, but Sanderson has literally barely chipped slivers off the mighty iceberg of The Stormlight Archive, but considering he has the penultimate Wheel of Time book coming out in November at almost 900 pages, Sanderson has certainly proven that he can get a lot of good quality writing done when he needs to, so fans shouldn't have to wait too long before the next mighty volume in this terrific new series is released.

B003102JDM|4.0|To really understand this film you need some background in Jewish culture and some intellectual insight.  I thought that I have both, but I do not understand this film.    For me, it seems to be a film in search of a coherent plot, but maybe that is just me.      I think that this is a case of weak casting of the lead character (not his fault, he did was he was asked to do), and two brilliant film makers who reinforced each other's witty ideas and scene formation, all the while without a coherent plot.  Folie a deux?  In fact, perhaps if the characters were less subdued and more outrageous???  But that is me?      Now I do not wish to be all negative.    I enjoyed many parts of the film.    So many aspects of the film are outstanding.  The acting, the photography, the music, the scenes, many characters, many pieces of dialogue, (yes, I did enjoy many parts of it).  And when I watch certain scenes again, I find more to like.  Thanks to the miracle of the remove control, I can just jump from one scene to another.  I must say, that there is brilliance in this film and I enjoy many parts of if.      ADDENDUM. SEVERAL DAYS LATER.     But overall, it I do not understand it, (if it does have a secret meaning).      To each his/her own.      OK, I watched parts again.  I think that it is better than my first impression, but still with problems.  IMO, worth seeing, with a dvd player remote.      I will watch it again, but as a film with a coherent plot and story, I do not get it.
1401228801|3.0|In the fourteenth volume of the award-winning Fables comic book series, writer Bill Willingham reveals his true intentions with the next important story arc after the great war between the good fables from our world and the evil ones of the Homelands.  What's left of Fabletown is a destroyed ruin, while its new king and owner, the mysterious and terrifying Mister Dark - the substance of all your nightmares and more - is building his own lair, plotting and planning.  Meanwhile the disowned fables are hanging out at the Farm in Upstate New York, working out what they can possibly do against the powerful and seemingly unstoppable Mister Dark.  The powerful witches of the former 13th Floor are plotting together to stop him, while Frau Totenkinder has an idea up her sleeve and disappears into an unknown place in the Homelands.  And on another story, the now disconnected and lost business office, the giant home to all things fantastic and fable has managed to free the evil witch Baba Yaga, who employees the great genii to help her; it will be up to Bufkin, a flying monkey, to save the day.    Witches pushes this growing story a little further along, adding some new characters and building on some familiar ones, as small, insignificant fables become mighty heroes, while others seem stumped in their current predicament.  Willingham and Buckingham do what they do best, keeping this series fresh and addicting for readers who will be left impatiently awaiting the next collected volume.

0553805371|3.0|As a reader, reviewer, and writer, I often wonder how word of mouth and rumor and the great press machine get rolling.  Take The Grand Design for example: Stephen Hawking has been wowing the world since A Brief History of Time, and with the publication of his latest book approaching, commentaries and thoughts began to spread on how this book would challenge the fundamental juxtaposition of science vs. religion once and for all.  After reading the under-200-page book of theories, discussions, photos and diagrams, my conclusion on The Grand Design is that for the most part it reads like a short college textbook on particle physics and the universe.  Nothing necessarily revolutionary or shocking in its thoughts and ideas that couldn't be found in a number of other science books; perhaps the key is the important author name on the cover?    While The Grand Design isn't the explosive book word of mouth has made it up to be (however it has sold considerably well) - akin to Colin Tudge's The Link: Uncovering Our Earliest Ancestor which was supposed to revolutionize the field of archaeology - it does nevertheless possess some interesting and at times fascinating theories and discussions of why things are the way they are.  For the last couple of decades physicists and astronomical scientists have been doing their day to day jobs, while in the back of their minds they have been hoping to stumble upon the unification theory, essentially - as Douglas Adams precisely put it - a theory of life, the universe and everything.  From a physics standpoint, it is the bringing together of gravity, Einstein's relativity theory, and the theory of quantum mechanics which will help explain why everything is the way it is and how it got to being there.  In the Grand Design, Hawking, along with co-author Leonard Mlodinow, give readers a strong introduction on the universe, particle physics, quantum mechanics and gravitational forces, and the launch into M Theory - the theory of life, the universe and everything.  While they don't have all the answers yet, and there's still a lot of ground to cover, it seems that M Theory may in fact be that ideal that scientists have been searching for for so long.

B000021YQV|4.0|Much better than \\"Hypnotize,\\" maybe not with sales but quality, \\"Toxicity\\" was definitely worth the listen. A fierce rollercoaster can describe the experience with this album.<br /><br />The reason that I gave System of a Down's second effort 4 stars, which is still good, is because of parts of \\"Chop Suey\\" and \\"ATWA.\\" It's indisputable truth is that lyrics about \\"self-righteous suicide\\" and lyrics that speak of a religious matter that isn't correctly grasped (Chop Suey) has a negative connotation, and I don't like to think that anything like that track was overrated; I'm not sure why an aspect of \\"ATWA\\" seemed like a dead man walking (I don't feel/eat anymore).<br /><br />Most of the rhythms on this album were exquisitely done and are fun to listen to like \\"Bounce,\\" \\"Psycho\\" and \\"Deer Dance.\\" Of course, weird lyrics are presented. Most of the album is fast paced, but at times, rhythms slow down.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Toxicity\\" is an intriguing masterpiece.

If your trying to decide between all of Sophie Kinsella's book choose this one!
B002XZ62HK|5.0|My husband and I love Celtic Women. We've been following them the last 3-4 years on PBS where we first discovered them. We have their first CD and DVD that we saw. Now we've purchased this and the DVD. We love this CD and DVD better than their first one. They've just gotten better with time. Love the music selected. This is a great companion to go along with the DVD. One of the best songs in the whole concert \\"You'll Be In My Heart\\" sung by by Alex is included with this CD. It's a pity they didn't include that in the DVD not only because of the song but the staging and effects that went along with it. Not quite the same just to hear the music on that one and not see it too. But at least we can hear it on this CD.     I highly recommend this CD and also the DVD for this Concert it is their best as far as I'm concerned. This Deluxe set includes 2 extra songs at the end which are \\"live\\" from the Concert. \\"The Call\\" and the \\"Finale/Mo Ghile Mear\\" which are not included in the original CD. The heart \\"charm\\" that comes with this is nice but not why I purchased it. This Concert was stunning and we love it the best of all of them so far. Get it you won't be sorry.
B001KOFH2G|4.0|For Firefly fans, this movie is a must watch. I thought the Blu Ray picture and sound was very good. The movie is action packed and has the edge-of-the-seat suspense that keeps it moving along, as the TV show did. However, right from the beginning it doesn't have the same light-hearted feel of the TV show, which I missed. This movie, perhaps the final chapter in the story of the brave Firefly captain and his gallant crew, is more violent, serious, and humorless. I wouldn't watch it again, but I will watch the original TV series again.
B0041KKYCY|2.0|I recently watched this poor excuse of a remake and expected much more considering its 1.5 million budget. Apparently, better cinematography and one or two better actors can't save this flop. The first problem here is the girl they cast for the leading role. She's supposed to be a novelist but she has the physique of a pro volleyball player. I don't get that. Writers tend to be softer looking because of their sedentary lifestyle. Long hours of writing and research tend to do that to writers, generally speaking.<br /><br />The next issue I have is with a certain phrase that's become popular in our culture. This phrase turns out to be a big pet peeve of mine: \\"my bad.\\" It's a close tie with \\"basically\\" followed by \\"actually\\" coming in at third place. Why I mention this is because the script writer decided, with his infinite wisdom (move aside Shakespeare), that \\"my bad\\" belongs in the script. Perhaps to cater to the vapid youth of our society. As a result, Butler is made to look less intelligent and better suited for the role of lifeguard if they only had such a role in the film.<br /><br />Moving on, Butler's acting was 99 percent unconvincing, much like her co-stars, with the exception of Andrew Howard (Sheriff Storch) and Tracey Walter (Earl). Butler failed to draw me into her world of pain because she didn't get into character. Her tears seemed fake and so did her attempts at expressing fear. As far as this round goes, Camille Keaton from the original movie wins hands down.<br /><br />Lastly, the acting got reversed in this film. What I mean by that is, in the original I.S.O.Y.G., Keaton stole the show while her co-stars didn't. In the remake the co-stars did better than Butler. Go figure. The person(s) responsible for casting could have gone to a school like HB Studios in New York and found a better pool of actors while saving a fortune.<br /><br />Okay, enough bashing for now. On the upside, the cinematography is way better, naturally, and the . . . wait, that's about it. I don't have anymore positives to mention. Darn!<br /><br />I'm going to end this review right now so I won't have to mention the unimaginative kill scenes and the unrealistic way Ms. Hill managed to subdue her rapists. Also, I refuse to mention how a low-budget exploitation film bested a modern, high-budget remake. Wait a sec . . . I just did!<br /><br />My honest recommendation: rent only, watch on cable, or stream via Netflix.e positives to mention. Darn!

B0000AUHQT|3.0|The drama, \\"The Great Gatsby\\", was first released in 1974 after the same named novel from star author F. Scott Fitzgerald. The director Jack Clayton, who is known for his specialization in bringing literary work to a movie, had a young crew of actors which became later famous. Among the actors are the two times Oscar winner Robert Redford as Gatsby, Golden Globe winners Sam Waterson as Nick and Mia Torrow as Daisy and walk of fame star Bruce Dern, who plays Tom.  The movie starts with the young man Nick Carraway settling in West Egg next to a mysterious, rich man, named Gatsby. As Nick visits his Cousin Daisy Buchanan and her husband Tom Buchanan, he meets the handsome golf player Jordan Baker. In the time of 1922 the East Coast saw a lot of parties and affairs. Tom has an affair with Myrtle Wilson and Gastby gives all these parties to see Daisy, which he had a relationship before he went into World War I. After Daisy and Gastby met at Nick's house the big mayhem breaks out.  The movie goes exactly along with the novel from F. Scott Fitzgerald. You will see dialogues copied word by word from the novel. To make it a dram for the screen, the director did perfect job by adding some more theatrical scene. Sam Waterson, who plays Nick, stands out of a solid actor crew. He brings Nick to the observer as a naïve, young man, who directly sees the problem of the time. He lets the other actors look fairly.  My personal point of view is that you have to watch \\"The Great Gastby\\" film, because it is part of the American culture and gives you the best gaze into the 20's.
B0046ECFRM|5.0|When I first bought this book, I was thinking, \\"Looks cute, but cheesey.\\" It was anything but that. The way the characters develop is extremely believable and adorable. Perfect for any teenage girl that loves chick-flicks!
B000JJS8TM|5.0|The new mix was excellent! I'm a fan of the Beatles, but I confess that the sound of the original vinyl mono of the '60s did not make me feel good. Now I can hear the bass and sub bass that did not exist. In some songs the producers used the original recordings and added other instruments. The mix sounds great in 5.1, I'm having a good time with this album.

Ther are very few bands that actually get your attention like Volbeat (Slayer did, KISS did, Ramones did, the Clash did, Metallica did, EMINEM did and thats about it...And now Volbeat).  I cant pick one outstanding track on this cd because all of them are a fantastic mix of metal/rock/blues/punk/\\"good\\" rockabilly, showing there influences such as, Johnny Cash, Danzig/Misfits, Social Distortion, Metallica.  If you forced me to pick one it's Mary Ann's Place (It will give you goosebumps...)    *Dont miss the boat, get into them before they get too big!!!!   They will....
B0049OSQ18|4.0|I, for one, loved the prog direction that The Decemberists had taken on 'The Crane Wife' and 'The Hazards of Love.' However, I can see that they might have taken that as far as Colin Meloy felt that they could, or that he wanted to pull back for awhile, and the result is this more stripped down but none the less fantastic Decemberists cd. This band can do no wrong in my opinion, and this is proof that there is nothing that they can't do. This isn't quite the radical departure that i've seen a few people mention, it's mainly the lyrics and the song lengths that have been scaled back, this isn't a reinvention, it's just a collection of more alt-country oriented tracks. If you like The Decemberists, you should love this, because it's great!
B000002HMH|5.0|When this first came out a lot of Metallica fans HATED it.  That was almost 15 years ago and I don't know if that's changed much.  I have to admit that when I first heard it I only liked one or two songs.  \\"This doesn't sound like the Metallica I love\\" was the main thought going through my head.  But then after a few listenings it started to sink in.    I've heard \\"Load\\" get slammed by a lot of people because they say Metallica sold out and followed the alt-rock/grunge trend.  Maybe they did, I don't know, but I came to view this album as Metallica deciding to go out and conquer new musical terrain rather than sit on their laurels and do another album like the one before it.  What musical terrain did they decide to conquer?  Blues!  Alt-rock!  Country (WTF?)!  They ruthlessly invaded all of these musical domains and subjugated them to the oppressive rule of Hetfield/Ulrich/Hammett/Newstead.      The blues is what really makes this album kick so much ass.  It's got a truly dirty blues feel to it, full of anger and not at all nice, not the slicked-up sissified blues played by guys in suits with lots of background singers.  The kind of heavy blues you get from early Sabbath.  There's lots of quarter-tone bends that give it an \\"off\\" sound and on \\"Ronnie\\" it sounds to me like Kirk is hitting harmonics with a slide.  They downtuned a little as well so it sounds a little heavier.  There are so many varied tones and textures going on in the music and with the vocals - it's like nothing they'd ever done before.  Not as fast as their thrashier early albums but they do a fine job of dirging things up Sabbath style.      There's honestly not a bad track on this album.  I think I still might like \\"Master Of Puppets\\" a little better but this is definitely one of Metallica's absolute best albums as well as one of heavy metal's absolute best albums!
B004BLTNM0|4.0|Whats a real cool thing about this film is that there is no music at all. Everything you hear is just nature itself. It adds a more intense effect if not some other feel to the film. Imagine that in a horror film. People would probably have a heart attack due to not knowing what comes next. Anyway, the plot is simple. A writer goes out to create her new novel in a small cabin in the woods far from the civil world. There she is stalked, assaulted, and raped many times by four loser men. She then survives and gets her revenge. Her deals of death to the men are brutul enough. The remake comes out soon and i question how good it will be to this one. I Spit On Your Grave is a cult classic and a must see for any die-hard movie fans, like me.
B003AO1SVS|3.0|Really I'd give it 3 1/2 stars.  On some days I might go as high as 4.      \\"Brothers\\" has some good songs on it, and I was excited when I heard that Danger Mouse was going to be producing because I've liked Gnarls Barkley, but I just don't like the end result here as much as \\"Rubber Factory\\" or \\"Magic Potion\\".      Their pre-Danger stuff had a very \\"blues/garage rock\\" stripped down sound to it.  This album has more of what I think of as a \\"soul\\" vibe to it.  That's probably the biggest complaint I have about \\"Brothers\\".  That and maybe it's overproduced.    There's a lot more instrumentation and variety on this album than on their previous stuff.  On \\"Rubber\\" and \\"Magic\\" you really get the impression that they could be recording it live - it sounds like just the two of them are playing with only a few exceptions.  On this album there are multiple instruments on each track so there's no way just the two of them could play these songs live and have them sound the way they do on the album.  I can totally understand WHY they might do that.  You can only do so many albums in the same vein before you (and your fanbase) gets sick of it.  You have to expand or change your formula eventually.  But I think The Black Keys are simply at their best when they're stripped down to just the bare essentials - just Dan and Patrick.    I was very curious to see how they would do the new songs live.  I got lucky enough to see them in Chicago on 1/1/11 and for the new stuff they had a bass player and keyboard player join them.  Actually, it was kind of funny, the songs I liked the best on this album I liked the least live and the songs I liked the least on this album I liked the best live.  No clue why or how it happened to fall out that way.    I will say that several of the songs on here have grown on me more with repeated listenings but it's still just not as fun as Rubber Factory or Magic Potion.
B004132HZS|5.0|This is a BEAUTIFUL adaptation of the Sherlock Holmes mysteries, and I'm a long-time fan of the original books and earlier movies featuring Basil Rathbone, Jeremy Brett, and others.    I was delighted to be able to purchase the DVD so soon after the mini-series premiered in this country.  The quality of the DVD itself was just fine, and I look forward to the next series from BBC/Masterpiece Mystery next September!
B002ZG99CM|5.0|I grew up on the original Karate Kid movie and I consider that to be one of the iconic movies of the 80's. Anyway, I purchased this remake based on recommendations and to my surprise it was quite entertaining. After watching the remake, I watched the original again just to see how similar or different the acting, action, and storyline were. Wow, the original was \\"SLOW!\\" I couldn't believe they took a classic and made it more entertaining. I still love the original version because of its sentimental value, but I definitely like the new one better.

B0013URJTG|5.0|I'm going to start this review by saying that I am 46 years old and I love all types of music, except rap/hip-hop.  I own over 1500 CD's and I love about 140 different bands/artists.  with that being said, Porcupine Tree is my second favorite of all time!!!  Now that's saying ALOT!!!  My favorite is Pink Floyd (who by the way is PT's #1 influence).  Lightbulb Sun is just another brilliant album by this relatively unknown band.  Steve Wilson is one of the greatest songwriters ever (IMO)and I also love his vocals and he is a great musician too.  This is probably my second favorite PT album behind Fear of a Blank Planet.

B0021L8V0M|1.0|Girls as tough as you are something rare... Or perhaps the song should be \\"For she's a Jolie good fellow\\". Angelina Jolie as Jack Bauer/Jason Bourne, leaping tall buildings with a single bound (almost), beating the stuffing out of numerous assailants, performing near-miracles on command through a particularly ridiculous plot. Ultimately such films are merely flimsy vehicles for the numerous high-energy chase/fight scenes, and as such I find them ultimately unsatisfying (except for the Bourne films - I found that Matt Damon was able to breathe life into Jason Bourne much more than Angelina was with Evelyn Salt).<br /><br />So, it comes down to taste. If you like things where the hero(ine) kicks the living daylights out of a series of baddies at regular intervals and can ignore the flimsy plot that allegedly connects these individual instances of utter mayhem, this is for you. If, however, you like a plot that makes some sort of sense in the real world, it isn't.
0698400852|5.0|I actually bought this book for my grandson, who is well on his way to becoming  an avid reader. His mom and dad tell me this book goes a long way  to helping him realalise that there is more to Christmas than Santa and   receiving presents. Therefor, I consider tha book a complete success, and   believe it to be a book that many parents and grandparents might consider as  an important part of any young reader's library.
1439181780|5.0|I recommend \\"The Power\\" book to all of my clients and friends.  I sent it to everyone in my family as Christmas gifts.  I'm still reading it, 6 months later.  The best book in years![[ASIN:1439181780 The Secret: The Power]]
B003V4AK8E|3.0|Ok first off i have both systems and played my 360 till it burnt out last year on the day i got the PS3.  That being said i am more comfortable using the 360 controller over the ps3 control. when i heard of this control i jumped on it and got one asap.    My first reaction to it was i loved how it felt it sat perfectly in my hands. the buttons are responsive  (though the left trigger its little too loose).  On getting it home and in to the ps3 i tested it out on M.A.G. there is where i found the dead zone that every one was talking about. The dead zone makes accurately shooting near impossible. Increasing the sensitivity does alleviate this problem some what but doesn't solve the problem.  So over all    Pros  Nice feel  buttons are responsive  and 360 players dream for the ps3    Cons  HUGE DEAD ZONE makes FPS play pointless.    All that said over all its a good controller for casual play with friends and only if they are not the ultra competitive type.
B0000CAXID|2.0|This is one of the Foo Fighters most popular albums. It was their first, basically demo's and other material David Grohl had saved up over the years, being Nirvana's drummer from '91-'94 and being in other bands before that.    This album is lauded by fans and critics. But I don't care... I don't really 'dig it'. This album has not even a tenth of the melody on subsequent Foo Fighter albums, it also lacks in the variety department. After a while, all the songs feel the same; slow rock verse with David mumbling away and an energetic chorus with him screaming or bellowing a few lines over and over, which is actually not bad, kind of catchy. Most of the songs are alt-rockers, with dissonant melodies and distorted guitars. There's one ballad 'Big Me'.    I like a couple of songs 'Big Me' and 'For all the cows'. That second one is slightly country. On top of that, the opening two songs, and then 'Oh! Goerge' are quite good as well. Most of the others aren't bad, particularly 'Alone and easy target', but I've never liked the last three songs, 'X-static' is just loud, without any substance, 'Wattershed' is possibly the weakest Foo song I have heard and 'Exhausted' is an experiment in ''overdistortion'' that doesn't really work.     Weak songwriting and some poor singing could cap off my feelings about this album. Anyway, it's not really bad, no, just more average, and 'average' albums deserve two stars... but plenty of music critics give it a good rap, and hey, so you can check that out for more positive reviews.

006072448X|2.0|In We Need to Talk About Kevin, Ms. Shriver attempts to tell the story of events, reasons, undercurrents leading up to a school massacre. The story is told from the point of view of Eva, the mother of the murderer, in the form of letters Eva is writing to her husband.<br /><br />This is a very large undertaking and the premise is great. Ms. Shriver has an excellent story to tell, and at times it is well told and even gripping.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the very style of the story (letters describing events to a person who was there) was a draw back. It made for very awkward language as Eva told Franklin what he already knew (with such phrases as \\"You told me. . . \\", \\"You gave me. . . \\") and gave a very egocentric feel to the novel from the first page, as Eva describes her her life to one who knows it intimately. I suppose this was to set up for surprises later in the book, but it simply didn't work.<br /><br />The story of Eva's relationship with her husband and son would have made for interesting reading, but it was so hard to get past the fact that I was reading a novel, due to the self-important (and unrealistic) style and language. This is \\"a novel\\", and the reader is not going to forget it. There were times, though, that the story was interesting enough for me to over look this (hence the 2 stars instead of 1), but those instances were few.<br /><br />In addition, We Need to Talk About Kevin is simply too long. Ms. Shriver spends too much time on details and issues that don't add to the story and that could easily have been pared. Other school shooting incidents discussed in detail, the 2000 election fiasco in Florida referred to again and again, feelings examined in minutiae. . . This book weighs in at 400 pages in oversized paperback, and would probably have been a good novel if 1/4 of that had been left out.<br /><br />Another difficulty I had with We Need to Talk About Kevin was the discussions (generally arguments) between Eva and Franklin (recounted in detail by Eva to Franklin despite the fact he was there) about their son. These conversations were not realistic, read like how a young person might imagine adults talk, and certainly did not read like adults talking about their own children. Perhaps Ms. Shriver intended this, used it show the difficulty between Eva and Franklin. Perhaps, but to this reader it did have any purposeful use, and made reading even more difficult.<br /><br />Due to the over-scrutiny, the self-importance and the length, by the time the book ended, the \\"surprise\\" was no surprise and the ending was simply a relief. If Ms. Shriver had kept with just the basic story, and had Eva give it in a different format, this could have been a stellar read. As it is, I advise you give it a miss.he was there) about their son.

1439153663|4.0|I absolutely loved the opening of this novel.  It gave a foreboding of what was do come and gave me a sense of dread that did not leave until I finished the book.  I found myself reading until late into the night.  I liked how Belle and Lavinia were both narrators for this book and you could see how life on the plantation affected each of them.  However, I really wanted to shake some sense into Lavinia at times.
B0049P0A0W|5.0|Skrillex is starting to gradually make a name for himself in the wider music world.  If you haven't heard his remix of La Roux's \\"In For the Kill\\" you may as well check that out on youtube.  Anyway, Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites is more of an EP than a full album, which is not a complaint, its just what it is; 3 of the tracks here are remixes of other tracks already on the disc/album.<br />Quite frankly, I feel that dubstep is the sound of the next decade. Its hip hop, its dub, its trance, its even got tinges of metal and there's always room for random samples.  It sounds like transformers humping on oxycontin.<br /><br />The title track is still my favorite, though Kill Everybody is enjoyable when you're not kind of scratching your head over the little \\"doll voice\\" in the chorus(it reminds me of Daft Punk's Technologic).  This is one of the best 'gettin' out of work on a friday' albums. Drop a tune in, slam the volume and rock out on your way home or out to a club or whenever. The synths and melodies balance out the distortion and drops mixing into a very aggressive but fun sound that no one else is doing right now.

0312370849|5.0|I loved, loved, loved this book. I read it all in one sitting; I couldn't put it down. Although it is fiction, I think WWII buffs will enjoy it because of the historical accuracy. I highly recommend this book!
B003L20IFQ|3.0|By now you know the synopsis of this film so I won't bore you with more of it.<br />This movie is terrifying from start to finish.I'm claustrophobic so watching this made me gasp for air a few times and reach for my Xanax bottle.<br />They didn't stop with the claustrophobia but thew in another element which is one more of my biggest fears,so the combination of the two were almost too much to bare.<br />It's a hard movie to watch but extremely well acted and executed.<br />You would think a movie that takes place completely in the confines of coffin sized box would be boring. NOT the case here.<br />There were a few lessons thrown in of course about Morality and Country policies and politics,It is indeed a nail biter \\"not to sound cliche'\\".I did find some of the Dialogue a bit far fetched such as him taking the time and having any other thoughts than survival mode to hurl insults at certain people like one of his wife's girlfriends or wasting oxygen and phone battery calling his mother with dementia in a nursing home when she didn't even know it was her son,but they were milking the \\"if I die syndrome\\"..the last 5 minutes of this movie will stay with you for quite awhile.<br />I am not disappointed I saw it.Would I buy it? no.

B004DK49DW|4.0|While I'd much rather listen to this than most of some of the bands being played on rock radio today, SD could've made a couple of more punk/rocker songs. Don't get me wrong, I love alot of thier ballads also.     I am from Bakersfield,CA so the song \\"Bakersfield\\" is special to me and that is why I gave this album the 4th star, otherwise it's probably 3 stars. That song and \\"Machine Gun Blues\\" are probably the two best songs on this album. Some others are good also, but overall it lacks rockin' songs that the other albums had like \\"So Far Away\\", \\"Gotta Know the Rules\\", and \\"Don't Drag Me Down\\" just to name a few. Also I'm in agreement with some of the other reviewers about not really liking the female background singers. If I want that, I will listen to my Kid Rock and Bob Seger collection, not SD.      All in all though, if you're an SD fan, you gotta pick it up and add to your collection. I just hope that they don't wait 7 to 8 years before putting out another album again! Btw, I'll be singing along to my hometown song as they are in concert here in 4 days!

B001H68KGM|4.0|I listened to the vinyl hundreds of times in the 70s... This shm-cd sounds a lot better than the regular CD but not as good as the vinyl.  Compared with what I remember the vinyl sound, this shm cd has a slightly smaller high and bass/drum sound (especially the bass).  and the speed of the drums playing is a little.. unclear...or slow to me at times.  To me, the secret 'weapon' of Rumors is the marriage of the bass and drum...they are so tight, and so good together, so live together from the speakers.   Listen to 'Dreams' closely, you'll know what I mean.   If you miss the vinyl sound or you love this album when it came out, BUY this shm-cd!  or get another copy in vinyl.  Else you wouldn't care or understand what I said anyways.

B0031YJFCQ|2.0|Lisbeth deserves much better than this book.  I liked \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,\\" could barely finish the second book(actually, I just skipped ahead to the end), and I'm still trying to get through this one.  Salander is a great character but the author doesn't do enough with her in any of the books.  He obviously can't really get into the mind of his own character of Lisbeth since he has her figuring out equations in her head or just staring at a \\"spot on the wall\\" much of the time.  The focus is on Blomkvist, an arrogant womanizer.  I agree with one reviewer who said they thought the author was reliving his adolescent fantasies since all these women seem to fall for Blomkvist, but there doesn't seem to be any real character development so it is very hard to see why he is so attractive to these women.  Also, there is a subplot about his married mistress, Erica, that is just stupid and annoying.  She's supposed to be this big time newspaper editor but has a stalker.  And apparently this stalker has stolen stuff that shows her in a threesome with her husband and another man, attending sex parties, having an \\"open\\" marriage, etc. I like to think I'm pretty open minded about a lot of stuff but really?  All it did was take up space in a book that didn't really have enough going on with the main story.
1439181780|5.0|I already knew about this book but the one place I knew would have it available, no fuss, prompt delivery was Amazon.  Well done!

I look for QUALITY in video and sound because its going on a 130\\" sceen :)  I bought this from the reviews I have read here- They were right- it IS sweet. I was NEVER a sting fan, and to be honest, I probably won't buy any of his other stuff because I cant see how it would be better than this.  Video is great , sound is great.  It kind of a mellow concert- not high energy.    Get it- you will see.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Trust me, you're in good hands. Joss Whedon excells at everything he puts 110% into, and the little things that he doesn't do right are entirely FOX'S FAULT!!! Yeah...I said it. *coughs* Dollhouse *coughs*.     But onto other news, don't hesitate for a second. Dr. Horrible is a wonderful mini-musical. I would delve into the details like all the others, but trust me. The musical is genius. Although, I would highly recommend \\"Commentary the musical.\\" While I can remember the songs from the actual musical, I actually liked the commentary even better. (Just download \\"Ninja Ropes\\", a song that's hilarious and has a great melody, and you'll see why.)

B002AT4KA0|4.0|It was really wonderful to see the original actors back in their rolls I disagree with some who will argue that \\"the cars are the real stars\\" not if you don't have good actors or lack for a better word the orginal actors reprising their rolls to go with the \\"Star cars.\\"    To start off we see that Dom and Letty made it to Mexico, only to run from the law again and end up in the Dominigan Republic pulling the same heist except this time it's gasoline, the law is closing in on them again and Letty is murdered by a ruthless drug lord named \\"Braga\\".    The little problem I had with some of the plots is what ever happened to Dom's original crew ??? Leon, Vince, and Jesse [which everyone knows that Jesse died in the first film in a drive by shoot out by Dom's rival Johnny Tran.] it was never explained in the film of what became of the other two or why Justin Lin didn't decide to bring back Johnny Strong and Matt Schulze.    Then we see Brian O'Connor [the Buster gearhead undercover cop turned rogue now an FBI agent] on the trail for the same man.     The film get's even more interesting when Dom and Brian cross each others paths once again, but this time the reunion isn't so subtle like in the first film.    Mia is back and the moment she is taken into custody guess who comes to save her ? you guessed it her ex-lover Brian. I could go on and on about the plots and twist but the bottom line is this.., it is great to see the original cast again reprising their rolls all matured and seasoned drivers had Justin Lin bothered to do his homework instead of rushing off to do \\"Tokyo Drift\\" with an entirely new cast he probably would've come out as a winner, but all and all  this lastest intallment was not perfect but it was alright in my book that is why I gave it  four stars.
B0025UHKNS|4.0|i truly enjoy my watch. i like the graph of the heart rate while working out as i try to stay in a particular zone. i also like the option of having multiple screens to view during the workout depending on what i am doing.  the battery life seems to be fine. i've had the product for only a month, but i have not witnessed and cold weather issues and i've run in temps as low as 20 degrees.     i like that the ant agent can read the watch from far distances...it doesn't have to be right next to it for data transfer.    i was a bit frustrated with the sleep mode. i turned it on about 10 minutes before my race. when i went to start, it had to locate the satellite so the watch couldn't start on time, but not really a big deal for me.

B001EN71CW|5.0|One of the greatest, too shortly lived series ever!! Firefly has it all, action, comedy, science.. you cant say enough, perfectly cast everone has a enduring role.. If you have yet experienced The series, do yourself a favor rent, buy, go to netflix , just watch this series, you wont be disappointed, is a good mixture of sci fi meets western type of feel.. It never should have been canceled, the network foolishly messed around with it, rearranged episodes, and didnt give it the time it needed... GO Watch Immeadiately!!!

B0034G4P7Q|5.0|When I first watched the trailer for this movie I was like the majority of people and said \\"How can this possibly be good? Its about facebook! A website!\\" So I did not watch it in the movies. But afterwords When I read how great of a movie this is I figiured I had to give it a shot. So I pre-ordered from Amazon and watched it once I got it and I was very surprised on how much I enjoyed this movie. It was not about facebook. It was about how it was created and the lies and the lawsuits and the partying and the life Mark Zuckerburg had while creating facebook. I dont want to spoil it but please know this isent just about facebook. This is a truly amazing movie.<br /><br />-John Madigan
B00000JLWW|5.0|One of the best movies ever, made in my opinion. Some consider it sappy, cliche, and heavily dated...but they just haven't seen it in a while.<br /><br />Once you sit down to watch it for the first time in years, your pessimistic opinion of the movie (caused by overexposure in the late 90s) instantly changes as you remember why the movie got so much credit when it  came out in 1997. It's great story telling aided by amazing graphics (for 1997).<br /><br />This edition is as good as any until a Blu Ray version comes out.
0525423842|5.0|John Grisham is a distinguished writer of popular fiction.  I have read many of his books and all of them have fascinated and delighted me. Most of his novels pertain to court cases, laws, and the overall judicial system.  He vividly describes the court atmosphere. His delineation of the general character and peculiar behavior of the lawyers, judges, and clerks is not only realistic, but also amusing at times. The lawyer mother of 13- year old Theo Boones is described as trying to lose weight for the past ten years and, therefore, she takes only coffee for breakfast. I was amused at her efforts and reminded of my own struggle with the same problem.    The story concerns with one Mr. Duffy indicted for murdering his wife but without any eyewitness to prove the case. Mr. Grisham then proceeds to bring a lot of life to the characters by describing their attire, their mood, their surroundings, their style of conversation and mannerisms. If a lawyer is having coffee and doughnut, you can feel the taste of the fresh, warm coffee and the sweetness of the crisp doughnut.  The author describes the settings in such detail that you feel as if you have visited the place yourself. He uses his pen as a paintbrush to draw pictures of such intensity that the reader is swept off his feet.  The principal character in the novel, a 13 years old lad named Theodore Boone acts like a lawyer.  He is ambitious and wants to become a trial lawyer. Both of his parents are lawyers. That makes it easy for him to go to the court often after school and loiter around the place.  Since he has been in the court often, he is able to learn and absorb the rules and regulations of the court and vocabulary of the law.  The protagonist of the novel aims to teach some terminology to other kids of his age by making them understand issues related to court. For example, he explains the meaning of words like, mortgage, interest rate, bank foreclosure, bankruptcy, circumstantial evidence, immunity, animal control, prosecutor, defense lawyer, direct evidence, indirect evidence, and the phrase \\"proven beyond the shadow of doubt.\\"  The explanations are part of the story and presented in a manner that even persons completely ignorant of law can benefit and understand them. I simply fell in love with this book and Theo's style in clarifying the problems to his friends.  In my opinion, this is the way a complicated subject should be introduced to children.  This book should have a place in every school library and be prescribed as an additional reading in the middle and high school.  Because the novel is written for the young readers, the language is simple, the narration is smooth, and the contents are not only interesting but also educational.  Some have criticized this book, saying that the plot, theme, and the characters are flat.  When the kid starts explaining the meaning of the words related to law, the critics say children will fall asleep because it is boring.  I am afraid that is not my opinion.  I find the characters are lively and the explanations about the words pertaining to law are clear. The critics also feel a 13 years old boy cannot comprehend law so well and it is rather unrealistic.  I fully disagree with the criticism.  Children's minds are like sponges and absorb much more than we think of them. Children take whatever we offer when they are growing.    The only criticism that I have is, the ending is vague.  Mr. Grisham leaves it to the reader's imagination although he makes it clear that the judge believes the witness has told the truth.

0312600844|5.0|Few writers offer such intense emotional journeys with their characters as Franzen.  His patient writing pays off in building sturdy psychological profiles with his characters.  This allows the reader to become immersed in both the internal and external journeys of the characters, which ultimately makes for a long, but rewarding, read.  It would be hard not to believe these characters represent some tangles from  Franzen's own internal arena.  The depth and degree of attention given to each leads one to wonder how a writer can so intimately relay the inner workings and motivations of the emotionally teetering female stalker, the despising depressive and the rationalizing middle-aged conservationist turned natural resource mining advocate.  It was worth the nine years in waiting for the follow-up to the highly publicized Corrections.
0316010669|5.0|I receieved this book as a gift, and I was surpised it was from author I already enjoy. Bravo Zulu gift giver.<br /><br />The Power of Thinking Without Thinking is written so that the reader can relate to the material as it is devoured. Gladwell points out information you kind of thought you knew. The perpective and method in which he delivers the information allows you to understand and utiltize your unconscious thinking as well as the unconscious thinking of those around you.<br /><br />His method of delivery is association to everyday relative stories. Above and beyond just the mass research he has obviously spent years compiling, he dares to present material with personal biases and the power and effects biases create.<br /><br />I do not want to give out the score before you watch the game, but I would consider this a must read.<br /><br />Enjoy!

0385341679|5.0|Have you ever read a book that takes you on a ride? That makes your heart race with the characters' own? That has you screaming at the book, \\"Stop, you idiot!\\" or maybe has you cheering them on out loud in a manner that makes everyone in the room look at you as if you've lost your mind.  This is one of those books.  When Mac was being stupid, it was me screaming at her.  When things went well, it was me jumping up and down saying \\"YES!\\"  while everyone around me looked at me as if I'd lost my mind.  If you read this book, be sure all of your errands and chores are done, because from the moment you pick it up, you will be sucked in and nothing else will matter but whether Mac makes it out of this next scrape alive.

B000PMLFRA|1.0|George wants to pretend his original movies never existed and his tweaked versions are the ones we are supposed to blindly accept.  Some of us are not willing to subscribe to his altered version without a respectful regard for the fans who remember and love the movies the way they were.  I understand its his baby and he can do what he wants, but he should remember that its the fans that grew up loving the originals that PUT HIM IN THIS PLACE TO HAVE THE MONEY AND POWER HE HAS.  If it weren't for us and the money we've (and my parents did when I was a kid) spent, his empire would never have happened.  Many of us as \\"customers\\" are asking him for this and he's essentially responding \\"the customer is always an *$$hole\\". (movie reference) Its pretty obvious the ego has blown out larger than the Death Star.    No matter what extras are included, no matter what additions he may add to the movies (again) to make it fit with the prequels, it will always be an incomplete set without the originals done respectfully.

0307592839|4.0|Jennifer Egan's \\"A Visit From the Goon Squad\\" is an interesting novel.  It's told in a series of stories, revolving around a central set of characters at various stages in their lives (often told from periphery characters who otherwise don't factor into the story).  It's basically about the rise, and fall, of Bernie Salazar, a partier-turned-record-exec, and his assistant Sasha.  Both have problems, both have histories, and both have come a long way from their rebellious youths.<br /><br />Not all of the stories here are spectacular (the story told in PowerPoint slides is interesting, but wears thin after a while), but all of them show a knack for creative narrative that is sorely missing in the contemporary fiction market.  \\"A Visit From the Goon Squad\\" isn't flawless, and it isn't timeless, but it's interesting, creative, and compels you to keep reading on several different levels.  For that alone, the novel is worth picking up.

I turned to my \\"friend\\" Amazon.com and was not disappointed.  The speed was just amazing. Thats probably because Amazon and amazing come from the same root word. Do they?
B000JML7EC|5.0|This is a great classic story.  This is my second time reading it and I love the story and the characters.
0375842209|2.0|I just do not get this book, and have not been able to finish it. The characters are boring, I just do not get where they come from or what is their point in the book. It seems... weird. Something is happening and I am really not into what is happening and I do not get why it is happening. It feels pointless to me.     Death is funny though. I enojoy reading his/hers comments. What seems to be a great idea for me it is really not delivered.    Many people like this book, so there must be some merit to it. To each his own I guess, this one is definitely not for me.

0451529065|4.0|A great book and a great add to any book collection.though a little out dated on the fact we now have DNA and the fact that Charles never did bring up humans in this book.(And who would with all the religious nut groups that had formed as a result of the civil war?)at that time(as well as now)would of hung him for sure if he would of even suggested that humans evolved instead of created in their present form in the last 10,000yrs.he received many letters that disagreed with his findings and was always worried that some one would find the \\"rabbit in the Jurassic period\\".<br />he did not have the term genes and would have been amazed that the blood of animals(DNA) could be traced to every other animal and was 100% COMPARABLE with the \\"Theory of evolution\\".the fact that Darwin thought he only had millions of years to work with instead of billions as we know now.he starts off with the domesticated,and move to birds then to other animals.

B001UREJYK|5.0|What a great movie!! This film was beautifully produced and tells the uplifting story of golfer Francis Ouimet (played by Shia LeBeouf) who, as an amateur,  won the U.S. Open in 1913. The video quality of this Blu-ray is outstanding and the audio is, well, breathtaking!! You wouldn't necessarily expect a killer soundtrack from a \\"golfing\\" movie, but, wow! This one really delivers, with some unbelievable bass, in particular. Wonderful, wholesome movie that the entire family can enjoy. HIGHLY recommend!!
B000MR9D5E|1.0|I love planet earth and bought this as a gift for a family member. I was disappointed to learn that not all the discs worked properly. I've had similar experiences with other DVD sets purchased on amazon. Lesson learned: the discounted price really results in a lesser value.
B002BSHXJA|3.0|Having had the time now to compare both the 'stereo' and mono releases of the Beatles catalog, I can safely say, I wished they were better.    My first real complaint is with the media as a whole, be it video or audio. The buzz word 'remaster' usually makes a person 'sweat with anticipation', and gets them to think that 'the ultimate version of (fill in the blank) has finally arrived. But there's several things to consider too.    Usually what I've found with the word 'remaster' of any product I've purchased is simply this - and this alone,' it just means 'they did something to it.' (Whoever 'they' may be.) So now we come to the Beatles catalog.     Are they 'remastered?' Yes, the stereo versions have been 'tinkered with,' no question about that. Are the mono versions 'remastered?' That's questionable.     The main thing about both of these sets is this. They are new transfers. And yes, they are better then the '87 releases - noticeably.    But other than the 'stereo' versions being better transfers, and of course they did some EQ work on them, as well as added some limiting to make them louder, I can't call either one of these box sets 'the ultimate.'     The new stereo versions are indeed better transfers then the previous releases as well as the mono versions. This is the unifying likeness of box sets.     There are many good observations by costumers on here already. The 'Cheapskates Guide' is very well thought out and put together. I have seen many other reviews here as well that anyone considering purchasing one of these sets should read. One memorable review I read that the listener noticed 'a lot of 'artifacts' as he put it. He is absolutely correct.     As I read some of the interviews with the audio engineers, one of their comments was 'we did very little to the tracks, if anything.' And the truth is I would believe his comment after careful listening. In one of the interviews I read one of the engineers commented about using some minor 'editing' to cleanup a 'hard low end plosive' (pop), but again they mentioned they did not do that much to the new transfers.     Personally, I'm very surprised at what the audio guys did NOT do. And yep, there's a lot of 'dirt' that could be 'righteously cleaned' to improve the tracks. BUT ... there in itself is a hot button (so to speak) with people. And that in itself whenever you 'remotely hint' at anything resembling the 'dreaded monster of 'noise reduction' people usually panic. So someone made the decision to use very little - if any at all on these new releases. (If I recall correctly, only about 5 minutes total for the entire catalog, and even that was no more than minor spots that I'm more than sure it was bad enough 'something had to be done.')    I personally don't think they did much of anything to the mono set. And right out of the gate for me there are tons of things I can hear that tell me this. Yep, like one reviewer said, 'lots of 'artifacts.' there is plenty of pops left, and lots of 'crackle' too. Most noticeably to me the 'graininess of the vocals' at times. So you 'die hard purests' that are 'afraid they did something' to 'your Beatles' mono set - fear not. And if they did, I can assuredly tell you since I own them - I sure wish they had done a lot more.     A good reviewer mentioned that the mono set is 'bottom heavy.' He is correct too. They are. Sometimes it's great for that particular track though. Other times it's just too much and makes the track 'muddy sounding.' Sure, it does add that 'bottom end punch', and man that can make a big difference to the right track. But with a track that is predominately 'acoustic', too much is just too much. (Rubber Soul comes to mind) But then you're faced with some 'gawd awful fake stereo' on the 'stereo version' of that CD. If you don't stand in the middle of the stereo field, it's tolerable, but if you do, it just nothing but annoying with that 'hard pan left / hard pan right' non-sense. (Personal preference noted here- of course).    As a whole though, I can say I do prefer the mono set over the stereo. But I say this with 'some' reservation too. The stereo mix of Penny Lane (which has always been a favorite of mine), is more pleasant to listen to then the mono version. So at best, I can't tell anyone 'one set' is better then the other, as in 'stereo vs. mono.' To me it's a 'mixed' bag, but again, I lean toward the mono set.     I can't give these set a 'glowing 'recommendation.' If you want a better then you got (as in the '87 releases), you will get that sonically.     But if you want something as absolutely wonderful as the REAL REMASTERS of 'Yellow Submarine' and/or the 'Love' CD - you won't find them in these sets. George & Giles Martin (and Geoff Emerick too I think), did an amazing job with the Yellow Submarine CD that was released about the same time as when the movie was re-released. (Which by the way does constitute for a 'real remaster' of a movie too.) The 'Love' CD, won a Grammy Award, so I'm not the only one to applaud the work done on that one.    So, my complaint only with the EMI, APPLE ... OR ANY OTHER COMPANY that claims 'remaster' - be honest enough to tell people - yeah we did something to it ... but they are still dirty looking ... dirty sounding ... and never got any PRISTINE RESTORATION WORK done on them. Oh sure, we EQ'd them. Oh sure, we made them louder, oh sure we made the picture darker, oh sure we fiddled with the sound ....     But to call it a 'remaster' ... if it was a bad track to begin with .. or a bad print that needs RESTORATION done to it ... just doesn't cut it at all with me anymore.     Which bring me to a close on this. Except for one final point. I have no idea why Apple said 'it took four years' to get these box sets out. The artwork? The legal hassles? I don't know. But to me when a audio engineer tells me 'they did very little to the tracks' and I can tell they didn't, why promote them as such, as if to imply the entire audio team spent that kind of time making these possible. (?) If Apple says that, then you gave the audio guys some very very long tea breaks, (Since Abbey Road studios in England.)     At any rate, I do lean toward the mono's on several things, but even those tracks could have been much better.     I have no doubt - friends and neighbors - we have not seen the last of the phrase 'newly remastered' ... and I sure hope Giles Martian gets on board here, even if he can't get his dad out of retirement.     Help us 'Obi Wan Martin' - you're our only hope! (And please bring Geoff Skywalker with you !) What we REALLY WANT is to see Apple REMIX ANYTHING THEY CAN .. with whatever is left ... from the master tapes. AND to do that 'righteously' ... ALL the master tapes need FULL RESTORATION work done on them. (Did I YELL THAT LOUD ENOUGH! ... (hehe!)    Am I glad I got the mono set, sure. But again, I wished they'd been better.    Take care all, and enjoy what we got for now.

B004AHNIGM|4.0|I have loved Gregg Allman's music ever since the 80's. This CD is so good to listen to because he has been through a LOT the last 14 years, especially with his health. You can literally hear his life experiences come through in his voice as he sings these blues classics. I especially adore \\"Little by Little\\" and \\"I Can't Be Satisfied\\", the latter of which was playing at FYE when I purchased two other CD's. Had I not been at the store at that time, I would have missed out on this release. Gregg used to be such a good looking man back in the day. Be prepared for a real shocker when you see the photos along side the liner notes. His lifestyle has taken a toll like you can't imagine. Strangely enough, his voice really hasn't changed all that much. He has come full circle with this release.....it shows everyone clearly where his early influences have come from. Hopefully, this won't be the last we hear from him.
006145205X|1.0|In adding my voice to the critics of The Rational Optimist\\" I confine myself to some topics covered in the book which relate to my expertise and not addressed by other reviewers.     The categorical statement: \\"The inescapable fact is that most technological change comes from attempts to improve existing technologies.\\" pg.258 is difficult to square with the dominant source of innovation, industrial research, in the 19th and 20th century in close collaboration with major research universities.    There is no basis for Ridley's statement \\"The great innovators are still usually the outsiders.\\" pg. 260  The semiconductor industry which has been the backbone of the burgeoning world of information and communication is based upon the inventions from  a few major industrial labs such as Bell, IBM, NEC and Intel.     Nor is the statement \\" ... government spending on R & D has no observable effect on economic growth\\"  supported by the evidence of the last hundred years and the increase in such spending the   world over. One need only think of nuclear energy, the internet and the genome effort, hardly unknown to Ridley.     These are a few examples of some of the sweeping conclusions which have no basis in fact. They show an arrogance on the part of a successful and respected author, that he can  get away with anything and a willingness of a publisher to go along with it.       Anyone interested in this aspect of Ridley's distorted presentation can turn to the balanced and well researched exposition by Robert Buderi : Engines of Tomorrow, Simon & Schuster, 2000 rather than Ridley's source, Terence Kealey's, Sex, Science and Profits, William Heinemann  Ltd. 2008.
B0044CG71G|5.0|What's up with the wish list function for video on demand? I try to add an entire season and all I get is the first episode. If I wanted just the first episode on my wish list, THAT'S what I would've added. This also causes confusion in the ordering dept. as well.   I ordered Primeval, which, unbeknownst to me, labels it's episodes numerically, and when you're not familiar with the Tivo dl-ing process, results in Episode 1 season one being listed immediately before Episode 1 season two with NO differentiation as to which is which. When I order a season, I'd like to GET the season, not just the first episode. Why do I have to waste time specifying that I want every episode for a season after having ORDERED the WHOLE SEASON?   Not really mad, just frustrated by something that should be much easier than it actually is. If I missed something, I apologize for the rant, and appreciate any explanation that alleviates this concern.  Thank you-  Imp Teaser
B004DK49DW|5.0|It always happens. A band matures over the years and the musicianship and comfort in the studio grows as well.  Then the ones who were \\"there first\\" freak out and can't take it. It has happened with everyone from The Stones to R.E.M., from U2 to The Clash.  And now it's Social Distortion's turn to catch the wrath of the faithful while the rest of us enjoy a truly great rock album...the best so far in 2011. While Social D's little souls have grown, the core fans are left petulantly stomping their feet. Those enlightened enough to transcend the past will enjoy a great record.  Social Distortion sure have.

Also enjoyed Olivia Olson's \\"All I want for Christmas.\\"  I was disappointed that they took out the Pointer sisters version of Jump and substituted a cover band.  Also the \\"all you need is love\\" and \\"Christmas is all around,\\" are studio versions rather than those that appeared in the movie.  A bit stilted and lacking some of the extra musicians.  But I'm still glad I have the CD so I can put the songs I want on my Zune.

B000002SE0|5.0|I believe there are two definitive studio recordings of Turandot in the market; in no particular order you can choose either from the Sutherland/Pavarotti/Mehta reading or this one with Nilsson/Corelli/Molinari-Pradelli. So, which one should you choose?, well I'll describe some pro's and con's of both recordings before my final recommendation.    First of all, Birgit Nilsson IS Turandot. When she begins her singing in Act II you can really hear and feel the ice hearted princess. Her phrasing and attention to dramatic accents in \\"In questa reggia\\" are thrilling. Seas of ink have been written about her clear, brilliant and powerful high notes which she displays with full splendor during the recording. However, once Calaf has given her the melting kiss of love, her voice transforms immediately into a vulnerable woman in love. Her dramatic understanding of the role, as well as her vocal fireworks are fully demonstrated in this recording. On the competing set we have Joan Sutherland as Turandot who, although great in dramatic lyric roles such as Norma or Lucia, falls short as Turandot. She just doesn't has Nilsson's commanding power and icy vocal color. Joan sings the part beautifully (almost too beautifully for the what this raging role requires) but her voice does not catch enough drama during the most intense scenes. For the Turandot part, Nilsson comes victorious over Joan.    Franco Corelli is the incarnation of Calaf. It is true that Corelli was much more \\"on fire\\" on the stage than in studio, in this recording he shows his beautiful, masculine timbre and displays incredible breath control, however he lacks some brilliance in the high register as well as the careful, disciplined phrasing that he used to show in live recordings. None the less, his \\"Non piangere, Liu\\" is the best rendition of the aria on studio, ending the scene with the third \\"Turandot\\" call lasting forever. Corelli was the only tenor with the vocal authority and exploding accents to make you reallyfeel that the prince is fighting a match for his life against the icy princess. His trademark moments such as the high C in the phrase \\"Ti voglio ardente d'amor\\" are there, which he hits with one breath in an incredible display of technique. He is, hands down, the most vibrant, powerful and energized Calaf on record. On the competitors set we have Luciano Pavarotti as Calaf, creating on of his best recordings on studio. He has what Corelli lacks which is a beautiful phrasing in absolutely all the role's lines, as well as fresh brilliant notes. Needless to say that his \\"Nessun dorma\\" is a benchmark. However, he sounds miniature if you compare him with Corelli's titanic powers. Pavarotti is more refined and careful with the role's details, but Corelli is electryfing and wild in his interpretation. So, ¿who emerges winner?, I believe this is a tie...with Pavarotti you have waves of beautiful sounds one after the other but miss a bit the sensation of a strong hearted prince, with Corelli you have a more sloppy phrasing but passionate singing full of power, fire and excitement.    Molinari-Pradelli conducts the orchestra with brilliance and clarity but has nothing to do against Zubin Mehta's tempestuous and exciting reading of the score which, hands down, is THE best reading on studio in the market.    So, ¿which is the best Turandot on studio?...well there is no clear first or second place, as everything in Opera, it is a matter of your own taste...my suggestion is; if you want the greatest princess ever recorded, paired by the most powerful and dramatic (if not quite beautifully phrased) prince, then go for Nilsson/Corelli. If you want a less dramatic experience but filled with beautful sounds from both the main characters, go for Sutherland/Pavarotti.    I can't live without both!
B003ELOQCK|2.0|Maybe you had to be there...this one is a snoozer.  New songs are so slow, boring and Bono shows little inspiration in his lyrics. Bands new songs have lost any form of  intensity, may be time to find another new sound.  Bono speaks his way through majority of the songs, seems short of breath through most of the songs.  Set looks awesome. As always, Edge brings it.
B003L20IFQ|1.0|I really couldn't wait until this movie came to DVD and I could see it. What a waste of 90 minutes!! To watch a movie with one person in it and it seems to make a political statemet that nobody cares about people, especially big corporations and the US government. I expected much much more but did not get it. I like Ryan as an actor and I really don't think another actor would have done much better in this movie but the script was really bad in my opinion! Best case for anyone that hasn't seen it wait until it's on HBO or better yet wait until it's on free TV. To much hype that this movie was great but I extremly disagree. Long story short SAVE YOUR MONEY.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|I was having dinner with some friends about 6 months ago and our conversation somehow became about time travel and parallel realities. Possibly because I mentioned at some point how much I love the TV show Fringe. Later that evening they asked if I had ever seen the movie Donnie Darko. I replied that I had never heard of it. They handed me the movie and told me to check it out, that it is probably something I would enjoy. Looking at the cover and jacket, I thought it was some kind of slasher flick and I wondered why they thought I would like it as they know I am very much against violence and cruelty towards any living thing. I graciously accepted it and when I got home I put it in a drawer. A few months later I came across the DVD and decided to watch it so that I could return it to them afterward. Imagine my surprise. What a brilliant thought provoking movie. Great acting, wonderful soundtrack, and a plot that makes you want to watch it again and again (which I did) to keep uncovering new things that you may have missed. I reluctantly took it back to them and told them how much I loved it and that I was going to buy myself a copy. They insisted I keep it saying they didn't care for it but they knew I would.<br /><br />I recently saw the original and enjoyed that as well. I think it compliments the directors cut nicely and I hope everyone will experience both versions. The original is a bit more mysterious as you don't have the clues from Roberta Sparrow's book and a few more defining scenes. Both will leave you with unanswered questions. And when you wake from a vivid dream ... could that mean ....?<br /><br />Only negative to the director's cut is that I wish they had left the Watership Down scene on the cutting room floor. And Rose Darko smoking at the end of both versions was a distraction as she doesn't smoke anywhere else in the movie (and I'm pretty anti-smoking anyway).<br /><br />Eddie Darko was way cool. What a great father.<br /><br />And the 'Mad World' ending, which I have watched over and over is so beautifully done, I get chills thinking about it. Especially Frank touching his right eye and Patrick Swayze grieving for all the evil he has done. Wow.<br /><br />Cellar Door has become one of my favorite sounding phrases.<br /><br />And as I see all the suffering in the world, I see the brilliance in Roberta Sparrow's line \\"Every living creature on Earth dies alone.\\"<br /><br />Very highly recommended.er and over is so beautifully done, I get chills thinking about it.

B004AHNIGM|2.0|Well here we go again.  Am I listening to Robert Plant,  or is it Jakob Dylan,  Wait... the title says Gregg Allman.  You could have fooled me.  Another boiler plate rendering from the T bone music suffocator.  And this is recent.  T bone wasn't always like this, but everytime he produces someone over the past couple of years, THEY ALL SOUND THE SAME. Gregg Allman gets a five star for just keeping on, but this white wash producing with the same ol muddy sound is just plain boring. This sure isn't cutting edge Laid Back.
0143117157|5.0|I watched Invictus and then read the book. The books is so much better than the movie, for one thing this is not a rugby book, the actual details on the Rugby World Cup is a small portion of the book, the rest is about the great Nelson Mandela's journey from a political prisoner to his return to society and rise to power. The more I read about Mandela the more amazed I am of his character. Instead of despair he preaches hope, instead of revenge he preaches forgiveness. The end of apartheid is also documented along with a brief history of modern South Africa.    Even if you have no interest in South Africa this book is recommended as you will learn a lot about one of the greatest leaders ever lived in the history of humanity.
B003UMW66G|5.0|This is about the most beautiful movie I have ever seen in my life.  Everything is flowing.  The long drapery of each female actress, both gorgeous, are constantly blowing and billowing in winds, breezes and color.  Much is in slow motion, to accentuate the flow back and forth of the duels, the ballet-like sword fights that fill the movie. I can watch it over and over for the color and astonishing sword feats of the actors.Jet Li is at his best.  And it is based on real events.  My highest recommendation.
0061801313|5.0|When I saw that they were making this series into a TV show, I had to read the books. I still haven't watched the TV show, and I probably won't for fear that it will ruin the books for me.<br />To start, I think most girls had a friend that they loved to hate growing up. That's \\"Ali\\" in this series. She's perfect and everyone wants her or wants to be her. But as the story progresses, you discover what an evil witch she really was. So when her body turns up in her own backyard, it isn't too surprising.<br />Right around the time her body is discovered, her former best friends begin getting texts and emails that detail very intimate details of their darkest secrets that only Ali knew. And things get dangerous when they start trying to track down the mysterious \\"A\\" that's sending the messages. By the end of book four, A is revealed, and so is Ali's killer and all seems right with the world...<br /><br />As an adult reader, I identified most with Aria and Spencer. Aria seems to be caught in the middle of her parents' troubled marriage, which isn't fair, but happens all the time. She's quirky and off-beat and tries to deal with things the best way she knows how, but it usually fails. Like painting a red letter A on her dad's secret lover's chest... Real smooth, Aria... And Spencer is under a lot of pressure to be the best at everything all the time. She's convinced that her parents won't love her if she's not better than her older sister, which seems nearly impossible. Anyway, both girls put their hearts and trust in older men and inappropriate relationships which is like, bad, but taboo and fun to read about.<br /><br />I did NOT like Hanna. Like, not at all. I get it. She's insecure and feels fat. But holy crap! Annoying much?! And Emily. I felt bad for Emily. She's confused. She loved Ali but has a thing for Maya and her parents think you can \\"fix\\" being gay. I felt for her, but then she was like, lesbo-lusting after everyone... It was weird.<br /><br />Overall, the series is much more entertaining than I expected. The typical \\"rich girls being rich\\" genre is so overdone. So this was a nice twist on the usual stuff. Probably not for young readers, though. I wouldn't let my young teen read these. Maybe 15 & up...than I expected. The typical \\"rich girls being rich\\" genre is so overdone.

B003L20ICE|2.0|Frankly I'm really sorry I bought this DVD. Firstly it had an area code on it which wasn't compatible with my DVD player - bang goes $27. So I decided to bite the bullet and buy one locally,(another $30), only to find it wasn't the light-hearted entertainment it was advertised as. If you like porn get this movie; it's peppered with porn and really doesn't add anything to the plot. Story line was going nowhere and did just that. Pretty ordinary really. Only plus was an exceptional performance from Annette Benning.
B003R0LBVW|2.0|I was terribly excited to be given this book as a gift and thought how nice it would be to see what kinds of books Oprah supports in her Book Club.  I have to admit that I painfully suffered through 75% of the book when someone finally said,  \\"You know, if you do not enjoy the book and are not challenged by its content, then maybe you are wasting your time finishing it.\\"  That summed it up perfectly for me, wasted time!!!  I have read over one hundred books this past year and that was the only one I could not even finish.  So from now on, Oprah's reviews and even those of other known figures will not influence my selections.

B000002KHB|5.0|The best Deep Purple album ever.  This is the one that got me started listening to Deep Purple.  The first time I heard Smoke on the Water on the radio I went out the next day and bought \\"Machine Head\\" There's no filler material on this album, all are great songs.  This album should be in every Classic Rock collection. Of course Smoke on the Water has gotten overplayed on the radio over the years and it sometimes gets tiresome listening to it again and again.  There's a great version of Smoke on the Water on Deep Purple's live album, \\"Made in Japan\\" that I like better than the one on Machine Head.  But, in my opinion, Machine Head is still the best Deep Purple album.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|Being a former Marine, I thought that it was an excellent portrayal of the realities of warfare, especially the harsh reality of the Pacific Island Campaigns. The accuracy as to weapons, even to the 03 Springfilds used early in the Guadalcanal campaign, was spot on.    Every American should give thanks daily for these brave Americans and for those that fought in Europe, for ensuring their freedom. Without their sacrafice our nation would be much different today.
B000003CMD|5.0|I'll never forget where I was the first time I heard Ramblin' Man on the radio.  I had recently \\"discovered\\" the Allman Brothers.  I then started buying everything I could get my hands on by the \\"Brothers.\\"  Brothers and Sister is a great album; pure Southern Rock.  Not their best; any one of their live albums are better than this one but still a great album.  No Allman Brothers collection is complete without this one.
031603438X|1.0|I do not want to rate this a \\"1\\".  I am not rating it that low because I regret taking it in.  I am rating it a \\"1\\" because, after many years of not being an addict, and with the advantage of time to reflect, I thought Richards would have had so much more to offer.  There are definitely gems strewn throughout, but a good half of the book seems dedicated to rationalizing continuous periods of addiction.      I am a huge Stones fan, but thankfully, I asked for \\"Life\\" in audio form because if I had to read it, I think I would have become the junkie that Keef seems to be proud to have been. I think if you are a budding psychotherapist, this book is for you.  The state of denial that Richards lived in as an addict is begging for analysis. I have read several of the \\"1\\" ratings in the reviews.  I have to say that most seem to be guilty of hero worship.  It is foolish to believe Richards tripe about needing the drugs to keep an even keel or for the creative process.  What, because he says so. As Richards would say, C'mon.  It is equally absurd to believe he used drugs not to nod off as it seems every time Richards makes such a claim, it is quickly followed by a litany of stories of his nodding off, and sometimes with dangerous consequences.  At least now I know for sure why I waited hours for some Stones shows to start in the 70's.    It's not that I regret the time devoted to the book.  The descriptions of the evolution of their music made me go back and listen to my Stones collection with a new ear, so from that perspective, it was worthwhile.  By the endless stories of addiction, near death experiences, licking his addiction cold turkey only to right back to it were tiresome.  Were it the book I was reading, it would have been even more of a slog.  Keith seems to relish in his long period of addiction, and the resulting calamities in his life and the calamitous effects his addictions had on those around him.  Throughout the book, I could not help but wonder what his bandmates thought of his lack of reliability.  And his story is free of any acknowledgment that he spent his most creative years in a self-indulgent stupor.  I guess I only have myself to blame to think he had more to offer.  I mean, it's not like his lifestyle was news to me.  I guess I am rating this a \\"1\\" because I was hoping that there would be more insight about the music, the band, the tours, the people, etc. rather than just a litany of fog about addiction.      One of the amazing things is how he alternates between thinking he had complete control of his addictions believing that they contributed to his creative processes while at the same time telling about the disastrous effects it had on his life in a myriad of ways. Some might be impressed with the memories he shared, and the trinkets he recalls, but think of how much there might have been.  I think he could have devoted one chapter to his history of addictions, and cut the book down to 300 meaty pages from almost 600, and it would have earned a \\"5\\" from me.
B000002KEV|5.0|One of the best live albums ever.  I played mine so much in the 70's that I wore it out and had to buy another one.  Then I replaced it on CD and later transferred it to my iPod.  I still play it all the time.  The version of Smoke on the Water on this album is better than the studio version on Machine Head.  Great album, a real classic.  If you have a 70's rock collection then this album MUST be a part of that collection.
B0041KKYEM|4.0|This movie is crazy! Natalie Portman gave an amazing performance! I might be off on this, but it's like 'A Clockwork Orange' and 'Burlesque' mixed together in a psychological thriller. Portman stars as Nina, a ballet dancer who must compete for the main lead in the Swan Lake play. Nina's mother is very controlling and treats her like a child. (Similar to Carrie White's mother) Nina starts having hallucinations and becomes paranoid because she really wants the part of both the White and Black Swan. I would recommend BLACK SWAN!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />P.S. It's been awesome writing 1000 reviews, and can't wait to write 1000 more!
B001U3Y5XE|4.0|We played this game for about four hours and time flew!  We were three teams made up of two people, with ages ranging from 8 to 38. We played that each team picks up a different card and each team builder has to build based on the category rolled in the dice. The first team guesser to guess its builder's creation gets the point! We made easy builds worth one point, medium worth two and hard worth three. First team to get to twenty points wins.     This game is a great opportunity to be creative, as you can make up your own rules about time and points based on your group's age and skill levels. Don't be discouraged by other reviews, if you have at least one creative person in your group who can establish a simple rule structure, you'll have a great time!
B0045ODPKY|5.0|Angelina Jolie has the role of female action hero down! She is a total bada**! With her hard attitude, she manages to override common sense that someone so physically feeble as she is could whip up on burly, grown men. Nah, you don't notice that at all. You just cheer as she crushes them in such clever ways that never come across as MacGyver style implausibility. I loved this movie. It is non-stop action. I wasn't sure how it could wrap up in a way that made sense given where it was going, but it even ended perfectly- setting the stage for Salt II.
0143118420|4.0|I really enjoyed Eat, Pray, Love.  I thought Elizabeth Gilbert did a wonderful job explaining the scenery in the different countries and loved her language and funny stories that accompanied the journey.  The part that got to me was the section of the book when she explains how she has never really been alone.  Something I can totally relate too.      I recommend this book for everyone who enjoys a good book.
B0015DROBO|5.0|This book takes a bit to get into.  The first 70-100 pages are alot of background info that at first it seems really pointless, but once you get past that, wow! It really sucks you in.  All three of the books are amazing!

0307454541|3.0|I'm never fully sure how to react when it comes to books, movies or music with heavy \\"bandwagon\\" followings. It seems a double edged sword applies. For instance, if one LOVES a bandwagon book they're simply following the crowd. If they say they DON'T like a bandwagon book, there's the risk that someone's simply being a contrarian. Eventually, it becomes \\"cool\\" to say one doesn't like something that was at one point, commercially successful.<br />In the case of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, I'm happy (or sorry) to report that I fall in the middle of the spectrum. Yes, it's a very engaging mystery and grips the reader immediately thus beckoning us to find out what happened to Harriet. Mr. Larsson did a fine job of exploring the dark corners of Sweden's underworld and rural icy north.<br />But there were a couple of problems I had with this book. Firstly, the opening pages where they start going into pages upon pages of corporate espionage, money changing hands etc. gave me a knot in my stomach. Personally, my mind shuts off when that stuff crosses my path. But knowing how highly the book's been praised I traversed these pages and made it through. Then there were the cliches; I knew that I'd seen the \\"unconventional\\" goth girl burrowing her way into a corporate setting and \\"rocking the boat\\" maybe...just maybe...once or twice in my life. Oh yes, and the reporter out of his element with several \\"What the hell did I get myself into?\\" moments.<br />Fortunately, Larsson adds just enough darkness and disturbing elements to these characters' lives so that these cliches have a little bit of meat (albeit spoiled meat) on them.<br />[[ASIN:B0042X9TBM The View From the Dashboard]]

031606792X|1.0|This whole book is terrible...The writing, the story, the ending in particular is just full of mush and crap. (I'm a girl too, and I like some mush (for lack of a better word) but this was just rip my eyes out so I can stop reading this crap mushy)...    I could go on and on about why I dislike this book, but here are a few main points I'd like to make.    1. They have sex. Pretty explicitly...That's fine, but..This is what the whole FOUR BOOKS was about!!!! They're sexual tension. They love each other because he is attracted to her blood and she thinks he is so good looking (talk about his chiseled body one more time...)  They're relationship is made up of lust, not love, in my humble opinion.    2. She has no qualities a strong woman would relate to. I don't need a man to survive, I can stand on my own, and she cannot survive without edward, a boy she has known for less than a year? (Referring to her in New Moon) I understand loving someone, but she has a great support system at home (her father, wolf-boy, friends from school who if she had reached out to them they would have helped her).     Happy reading!

1607060027|4.0|[[VIDEOID:moG03PTW8C4WLA]]This book is presented in hardcover, roughly the same size as the comics. Inside, it collects cover art of the single issue volume 1-50, trade paperback volumes 1-8, Books 1-4 and Deluxe Hardcovers 1-2. There are also sketches and unused designs.<br /><br />If you are a collector of the comics, you already have majority of the art. The reason to buy this book is probably the commentary if you're interested in how they come up with the covers. Creator Robert Kirkman, artists Tony Moore and Charlie Adlard look back in hindsight at what they like and the ones that didn't work out well.<br /><br />The art is beautiful but there are a few misses as well - all that are mentioned in the commentary provided.<br /><br />This book is more for the ultimate collectors. Casual fans probably can do without it. Besides, most of the cover art can be found easily online.<br /><br />(There are more pictures of the book on my blog.

As the law grows increasingly closer to ensnaring Jigsaw, the game participant learns that AMANDA YOUNG (Shawnee Smith) may be an accomplice to his abduction, and his situation provides a choice between VARIOUS TRAPS (for OTHERS) or guaranteed death (for his family).  To help his cause, cryptic clues left via mini cassette tape lead him (aka life perpetrator) towards the precipice of twisted rehabilitation or a potential tomb.<br /><br />Several murderous contraptions like the CHAIN CHAIR (for a HABITUAL CRIMINAL), the PIG VAT TRAP (for an ACTIVIST JUDGE), and the NECK BREAKER RACK TRAP (for a MURDERER) provide horror fodder in the form of viscera and blood spatter, while other traps - like the opening scene EXPLODING RIB ANGEL TRAP - are inserted for the same reason Spock and Kirk always took ensign Jones on away parties (someone in the situation needs to die horribly).

0307474712|5.0|Em and Dex. Dex and Em. What started out as one day spent together in college, turns into 15 years of friendship and maybe more? It seems one wants more and the other one does not. We follow them through the years; over relationships, careers and their lives. They have their ups and downs together, but it always seems they know they can count on one another, for the most part. Dex is a good looking young man, having lived a privileged life. Emma is just a regular person, always feeling the lesser of the two. Seems when they are younger that Dex has it all and Emma is just struggling, working in the Mexican restaurant, which is one of the many hilarious parts of this book might I add -- to all her other jobs she did. It all comes to an ending though. Which I might add I am not going to say!<br /><br />The first few pages I thought, I can't get through this. But all the sudden out came a sucker punch and I was fully engrossed and when I turned the last page, I said NO that can't be IT! It ended and I sat there for a few minutes just in shock! Dex is one of those characters you aren't sure you can like or trust; but somehow you end up liking him anyway. A love/hate relationship! Emma is one of my favorite characters; bloody brilliant if you ask me!<br /><br />I will be thinking about this book for a long time. I am sad it had to come to an end because I was enjoying the ride.

1594202842|1.0|No, being an American-Chinese, I can tell you most Chinese mothers DO NOT raise their kids by the way the author described, may they live in USA or Asia!    My daughter is going to study in an ivy-league school this fall, but by no mean she was raised by these extreme cruel parenting ways.    Please, next time when you meet a successful/bright Chinese kid, do not automatically think his/her mother is like a \\"Ms. Chua\\"!      Just because Ms. Chua happens to be a Chinese do not mean her parenting method is Chinese, even she said so!      Well, I guess if she didn't sell her book using the Chinese label, it may not draw in as much attention.  What a smart market gimmick!

B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Disney Pixar's Up is a beautifully animated -though atmospherically quiet and occasionally slow-moving- movie intended mostly for children.  Hey I guess that makes me a big kid for watching it, lol.     It's about an old man who takes a special journey to South America to visit a place he and his wife talked about visiting while the wife was alive.   Well after the wife finally dies, the old man decides to take the journey himself by actually lifting his house off the ground by way of thousands of floating balloons.    It's funny because throughout the film, a crucial element to the storytelling is the old man constantly dragging his floating house around everywhere he goes, lol.  To join him on the adventure is a young boy scout looking for a badge that's awarded for helping the elderly.    Is it just me or does the old man look almost identical to Joe Paterno, Penn State's football coach?  It's almost too hard to believe it's just a coincidence.  Back when I was watching previews of this film from the TV commercials last year, I could have sworn Disney actually designed the old man to look like Joe.  Maybe not...    I don't know about anybody else, but the beginning segment involving the old man as a child and introducing himself to the woman who would turn out to be his wife is REALLY emotional and downright devastatingly sad.  I was seriously sitting there crying as the film quickly went through the motions of the man and woman starting out as children, then growing up and getting married, fixing up their house, not being able to have a baby, growing old, and eventually leading to the wife departing.  Maybe it's just me but the amount of sadness in this particular segment is really unbelievable.    Upon landing in South America, the old man and the boy scout meet up with some animals and have the adventure of a lifetime.      Up is a really good animated film for anyone looking to spend a little entertainment with their family.  I highly recommend it.  Just be warned when watching the first 10 minutes- make sure you have some tissues available, lol.  Really effectively well done bit of storytelling there.  Incredibly touching on so many levels.  The film never goes in *that* direction ever again.  Great movie.

B000B589JI|3.0|At first glance, this appears to be an invaluable addition to the carried equipment of any Zippo owner. Stylish. Functional.<br /><br />The fuel section is closed off fine near the nozzle, but right around the middle is where it opens to add more fuel. All that's there is a thread, no gasket or seal. So if you don't tighten it enough, the fluid will evaporate. If you tighten it too much (something I did, hence why I purchased another from Amazon) then it will freeze up so tight that you might destroy it trying to reopen it. As an emergency replenishment to my Zippo it does well enough.

B004FCEFUK|5.0|Let me just start by saying that I've found a truism in music of all genres over time: the \\"catchiest\\" music usually is the most quickly appreciated, but it's also the quickest to fade from memory. This truism challenged my appreciation of The Great Escape at first. Let me explain.     I was expecting another album like Mercy Falls.  Frankly, I think Mercy Falls is one of the most ingenious albums ever.  I think the story is good, and the arrangement and melodies are simply extraordinary. The album was breathtaking, memorable, melodious, and powerful. Said another way, Mercy Falls was Seventh Wonder's \\"Scenes from a Memory\\", but frankly they did it better than Dream Theater ever could.  I most appreciate memorable melodies, where Mercy Falls excels.    Enter The Great Escape. Frankly on first listen, all I heard was a bunch of random pieces strung together, most that weren't so memorable at first.  I KNEW I had to keep listening to it, and sure enough, my above truism came to fruition: I started to pick apart the album and realize what it was - a stroke of genius. It took a good dozen repeats and devoted listening.  Stick with it and you'll probably get the same reaction.    With an album that is perhaps far more intense and even mature than Mercy Falls, what the Great Escape lacks in Mercy Fall's memorable melodies makes up in deeper, more complex, more layered vocals and music. Where Seventh Wonder came of age with Mercy Falls, they achieved mastery with The Great Escape.    While all the songs are great, the title track The Great Escape, at like 25 minutes, is astounding.  This was the song I understood least upon the first 5-10 listens, but it is now the one I prefer most. What finally matured my understanding of that song was two things: finding out what Aniara, the basis for the whole song, was; and reading the lyrics along with the song.    First, you need to know about Aniara to make sense of the song.  [...]     Apparently, Aniara was the only piece of science fiction that ever won the Noble Prize. (Although Frank Herbert should've won it for Dune, but that's another essay...) In short, it's an epic poem from the 1950s about the escape of a group of refugees aboard a ship from Earth to Mars.  Their ship, Aniara, is hit by an asteroid and, having lost navigation, subsequently drifts away out of the solar system on an endless voyage into a dark abyss. The refugees look to a computer on the ship, Mima, who can create lifelike environments for them that remind them of home (sort of like Star Trek's holo-deck), for respite from their awful predicament. However, Mima, seeing how terribly the humans are treating themselves and each other, pulls the plug on herself.  Out of desperation and depression from their sense of hopelessness, they fall into a variety of rituals, sacrifices, lust-ridden ceremonies, and finally accept their fate and eventually (I think) all die after 24 years. It's a highly intense, emotional, and tragic story with a lot of humanity in it.      The Great Escape is the re-telling of this story, with the same storytelling ability and passion. In fact, sitting with the lyrics in front of me, I swear I had to fight back tears in a couple parts... all I could think was, \\"What am I doing, I'm a grown man practically tear-struck by some music?\\"  It's done really well, with good and genuine lyrics, and the backing music supports the story well.  The big point here is that to appreciate the whole thing, you need to sit through it like a movie and listen to it.  If you flick it on in your car for 10 minutes at a time, you're going to miss the experience, and the music will seem unmemorable.  It's when you piece the whole thing together with the story that you find out this is an incredible piece of art.    Aside from what I said above about the story, the music throughout the album is just great.  The album production is great too.  All in all, this is an extraordinary production.    I DO have one complaint, buti didn't want to ding the album for it.  There are a number of melodies on the album that are almost direct copies of the main melody from Mercy Falls.  I hate to say it, but it's pretty obvious that The Great Escape was leftover material from Mercy Falls.  They probably recorded it and didn't it use for that album, so they reused it for this one. I don't think it's a huge deal, especially given how different this album's content is, but it's pretty noticeable.    In summary, if you're looking for something new to listen to and immerse yourself in something that also tells a great story, pick this album up.  Get Mercy Falls too if you haven't listened to it.  These guys are definitely at the top of their genre - which is simply incredible for a group of part-time musicians. I suspect the guys from Dream Theater, Circus Maximus, Kamelot, and others will be listening to Seventh Wonder's albums to learn something.
B00008I8IF|4.0|Comfort music may seem like a bit of a backhanded compliment for this one, but trust me, it's not.  RAINY DAY MUSIC by the Jayhawks is the aural equivalent of a plate of home-made mac n' cheese (Mom's of course), that old pair of jeans that are almost about disintegrate, but fit so well, or a nice broken in comfortable chairwith a beverege of choice on hand.  We all live full lives, often challenging lives and sometimes need something that is of high quality, but which gives that reassuring feeling of comfort, or home.  The music on this disk is of the line of the Byrds, Tom Petty and the Heartbreaker, Gram Parsons, CSN and the more introspectie work of the Stones.  Borders are not be created and envelopes are not being pushed, they are just playing and singing from the heart.<br /><br />Tracks like TAILSPIN, STUMBLING IN THE DARK, SAVE IT FOR A RAINY DAY and MADMAN are melodic gems that will worm there way into your subconscience and stay there. Pervious albums like HOLLYWOOD TOWN HALL and TOMORROW THE GREEN GRASS are also top notch, but this is the one I turn to when the world's been kicking my butt and I'm in need of some solace.  It's not perfect, far from cutting edge, it might not even be their best work, but it's one you can turn to in a time of need, plus it won't screw with your cholesteral like mac'n cheese.
B0000047GA|5.0|I love the music on Emergency.  Lots of really good drum work, jazzy guitar playing and keyboard jams that feel really ambitious.      However whoever thought it sounded good enough to release, stinks.  It's very reminiscent of John McLaughlin's Devotion (another classic album recorded poorly).  I'd like to say it sounds like it was recorded in a trashcan, but that would one, be a compliment and two, would make me a hypocrite because plenty of awesome-sounding albums sound like they were recorded somewhere in a deep dark place in lands yet to be identified!    Anyway, yes.  The music on Emergency is terrific.  Tony Williams is a talented musician (though I personally prefer his mid 70's work, but that's just me).  Maybe the remastered version (wait, *is* there a remastered version?) sounds significantly better.      You see, a problem with a badly made album is that a lot of the instrumental work gets lost in the background, and when it concerns jazz, well that means I'm not able to distinguish at least half of what's being played to me.      Be careful when you listen to Emergency.  You may find yourself a little annoyed and disappointed in the way it sounds and not have the urge to hear it through to its conclusion.
B0032Y8XH8|4.0|SIGH NO MORE, the debut album of Mumford & Sons has received universal praise, topping many best of 2010 polls including Amazon.  I'm just not feeling the love for this one, and can't quite put my finger on it.  The band is talented, smart and would seem to hit the sweet spot of influences (I hear English folk, The Arcade Fire, The Avett Brothers, Van Morrison among others that I really enjoy) that would make them a solid hit for me, but despite at least 20 listens over the three months I've owned this, I'm still vexed by my apathy.<br /><br />There are some great songs on here, especially LITTLE LION MAN and AWAKE MY SOUL, but others seem too ponderous or over-earnest to win me over. A little sly humor would go a long way towards balancing out the at times overly serious tone. If you enjoy this album, I would suggest trying Johnny Flynn's A LARUM which is in a similar vein, but to me is a more rounded effort.  Still, it's a pretty solid collection worthy of three and a half stars and  I look forward to seeing the direction the band goes in with their followup.
B00005JKDR|5.0|I ordered this item last minutues as a Christmas gift for my daughter because she indicated our copy did not play. I purchased and it was indicated that the item would take x amount of days and I more than likely would not receive by Christmas, which I was ok with. But, it did come before Christmas I believe I revieved it within 3 days. The seller is Fantastic and I feel they went above and beyond what was called for. I WOULD DEFINATELY ORDER FROM THEM AGAIN AND I GIVE THEM MY PERSONAL STAR OF APPROVAL!! YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.
0375842209|5.0|With a most original voice, Markus Zusak, writes a gripping compelling book that is part journal, part graphic novel, part history and 100% heart-wrenching.<br /><br />Written from Death's point-of-view, you will laugh, shout, and weep over this story of a young girl in Nazi Germany.<br /><br />A rare gem of a novel.
0385523912|5.0|This is a very powerful book.  I did not know that famine is such horrible event.  This book effectively portray a world that is hidden from us and another world that is hidden from them.

B001UV4XFG|4.0|Ok, so there are no tigers in this movie...  Oh well.<br /><br />I like this movie.  No, it's not going to change the world but it has great entertainment value.  I think so far out of the 3 in the series, I laughed more at the humor in this movie than any of the others...  Esp when Billy was talking to Edward and Bella.  \\"SUPER.  That makes me really happy.\\"  This line still makes me laugh.
B001IT2H2G|5.0|Quantum of Solace is one of my favorite movies and one of the things I like the most about it is the music.  I'm currently using a 13 star system, the more stars a song gets the more I like it.  Only 2% of the music in my collection have earned a 13 star rating.  Here's how I rated the songs in this album:    1: *\\"Time to Get Out,\\" 7 out of 13 stars    2: *\\"The Palio\\" 6 out of 13 stars    3: *\\"Inside Man\\" 13 out of 13 stars.  What an awesome theme!!  It's too bad it's only 38 seconds, this one seriously needs an extended version.      4: *\\"Bond in Haiti\\" 6 out of 13 stars    5: *\\"Somebody Wants to Kill You\\" 6 out of 13 stars    6: *\\"Green & Camille\\" 6 out of 13 stars    7: *\\"Pursuit at Port Au Prince\\" 6 out of 13 stars    8: *\\"No Interest in Dominic Greene,\\" 13 out of 13 stars.  So mysterious, so beautiful.    9: *\\"Night at the Opera\\" 13 out of 13 stars.  My favorite track in this album.  When I think of Bond, I think of this track.      10: *\\"Restrict Bond's Movements\\" 10 out of 13 stars    11: *\\"Talamone\\" 10 out of 13 stars    12: *\\"What's Keeping You Awake\\" 6 out of 13 stars, but a great track to sleep with.      13: *\\"Bolivian Taxi Ride\\" 9 out of 13 stars    14: *\\"Field Trip\\" 13 out of 13 stars, but so short :(    15: *\\"Forgive Yourself\\" 6 out of 13 stars    16: *\\"DC3\\" 7 out of 13 stars    17: *\\"Target Terminated\\" 6 out of 13 stars    18: *\\"Camille's Story\\" 6 out of 13 stars.

B002SL4PKK|5.0|The Greatest Show on Earth is yet another fantastically intriguing, informative, captivating, and well-written book by Richard Dawkins. It is an excellent summarization and detail for the evidence for the evolution of organisms by natural selection, gathered through scientific observation. I enjoyed the material as an informative refresher as well as updating the knowledge gained during completion of my Bachelor of Science in biological sciences. Dawkins does a wonderful job, at times in witty ways, of informing the listener of our current understandings of how and why change occurs in species over time.   There are a few places that I felt it would have been helpful to have the book in visual form, strictly from the standpoint of comprehending Dawkin's extensive vocabulary. Access to references to further investigate additional resources on the subjects covered by the book is another encouraging reason to have it in visual form.  The fascinating material and Dawkin's style have prompted me to enjoy the book more than once.    (The reviewer was compensated for posting this review.

B002MQYOFW|2.0|I did not read this book on the kindle but that still would not change my mind if I did.Being the big reader that I am I find it almost insulting that this book gets so much publicity.When I first heard about the book it seemed it would be interesting but I was wrong.The book itself really had no character it was kinda monotone and boring.Katniss the main character seemed heartless and you could never really understand her and I don't mean she was mysterious.Also I did not enjoy the fact that the characters were all about my age and were all killing each other.In fact in some of the way the kids were killed it left me wondering if the author needed help. If you are into books like these please don't let me stop you from reding.But over all i really can't belive this book was published.

142311339X|5.0|I wasn't too excited about there being another Camp Half-Blood series. In my mind, that would have been like Rowling sending a new set of wizards going to Hogwarts.<br /><br />But I was very impressed with this book. It was even better than Percy Jackson, better written as well.<br /><br />Some things I especially like (***SPOILERS***)<br /><br />--We focus on Thalia's character more (I always liked her) and get more of her backstory. I like that she and Jason are siblings and that she had been searching so long for him. I thought that was sweet.<br /><br />--Piper was a good, strong heroine. She fought for herself and didn't bow down to her snooty siblings to make herself look good.<br /><br />--Aphrodite was actually a pretty likable character. I expected her to be snobby and an airhead, but I actually liked her.<br /><br />My only real complaint is that I found Leo sometimes trying to hard to sound so \\"cool\\" and it was a little over the top, but I am willing to overlook this book. If you loved Percy Jackson, you will absolutely LOVE this book!
B0043ZDU1E|5.0|Another great Loreena McKennitt cd-she never ceases to amaze us. Loreena continues to come up with some new stuff while retaining the old Celtic ways. Great job!!
0439023513|3.0|The first book of the trilogy was absolutely amazing. Explosive. There are a lot of positive words I could use to describe this book. The second one was somewhat of a dud, but Collins stepped it up a little bit at the end. But this book? It just wasn't what I was expecting. Something felt off, there was something about the writing, the story, and the characters.<br /><br />(There are spoilers below)<br /><br />One of the main things about this book is the characterization. In most series, the characters have changed in some way from where they started. In this book, none of the characters seemed to have grown up or changed and the characters that did changed changed in horrible ways. Katniss, our main character, did not appear to have grown up much since the first book. I admired her stubborn spirit in the first book, but by the second book she felt whiny. This book, she was just...I don't know. She was a shell for some parts of the book. I missed the stubborn Katniss from \\"The Hunger Games\\" she was gone. For the other part of the book, she just seemed selfish, only caring about herself and nothing else. Like other reviewers have said, she didn't make any decisions for herself. She didn't become the mockingjay because she wanted to, other people talked her into doing it. She didn't try to fight for her life when she assassinated Coin. People made that decision for her. That seemed to be the case for most of this book. Katniss didn't make any choices for herself. She didn't try to fight for herself.<br /><br />Peeta was one of those characters who changed, in an awful way. Thinking about him being hijacked. Well, I don't really want to think about it. It was just tragic. I knew that if Peeta got captured by the Capitol, he would be tortured and he would be changed. But this was just awful. He tried to strangle Katniss. The sweet boy who gave Katniss bread was gone and I hated that. At the very least, he was more himself by the end of the book.<br /><br />Gale was a character who I feel we never really got to know. He was in the first book for the first chapter of \\"The Hunger Games\\" and was in it a little bit more in \\"Catching Fire.\\" But still--why are we supposed to care who Katniss picks if we hardly know who her other choice is? I felt like Gale was never well developed, but at the end, what he did and decided to do, I felt really did not complete his character. He appeared as a nice boy, a person who truly cared about Katniss and had feelings for her. But he created the bomb that killed Prim? Really? And on the last page of the book, pretty much, he says, \\"Well, it's been nice knowing you Katniss! Bye!\\"<br /><br />Some of the minor characters, not very important, still sort of bugged me. Snow was just weird. There's not other word for it. He was sort of an odd villain in the first place. He seemed truly despicable in the first novel and the second, and then in this one, I felt as though Suzanne Collins was trying to convey him as good. He's not! Katniss's mother never changed. She's been a constant shell since the death of Katniss's father and always so rough with Katniss. Their relationship was strained. I hoped that maybe there would have been some sort of love between them. But instead, she just picked up and left, saying the sorrow was too much to bear. There were some characters that seemed to almost walk in with little explanation and we're supposed to care for them when we don't even know who they are.<br /><br />I think what really felt like a huge thing that changed the characters was the war. It seemed to make them all depressing people suffering from PTSD. I'm not saying that's abnormal for that to happen, but after the war it seemed like none of the characters could get on with their lives.<br /><br />The other big flaw to this novel was the plot. It seemed so repetitive. The beginning started off slowly, talking about life in District 13. Then in the middle it was like a cycle: go to a district--district is attacked--someone dies--Katniss is under drugs. This happened at least three times. At least a fourth of the novel was spent with Katniss under the fog of morphling. Once she woke up more, it seemed like a recap. \\"Here's what you missed.\\"<br /><br />It's a very bad sign when you don't know when a character dies. I honestly had no idea that Finnick died until I read the reviews. If the scene with the cat hadn't happened, I wouldn't have known Prim had died. The deaths just seemed sort of implied.<br /><br />Although I was disappointed with \\"Mockingjay\\", I won't say I hated it. There were a few positive points. Overall, Katniss got a much happier ending then I thought she would have. I liked the epilogue, more of a peak into the post-war era of Panem with life looking up just a little bit.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this book wildly like I did the first two, but if you've read the first two, it's probably best to just finish the series.d at least three times.

B004A8ZWSS|5.0|Don't expect a deep moral, ethical, political or religious meaning in this film. It is not an author's film , as they say in Paris. It is first of all a remake of the eternal Ars&egrave;ne Lupin or Rouletabille to remain French, or simpler Robin Hood to turn English, or William Wallace to lean towards Scotland. And definitely I am fascinated by these thieves who steal the money of the very rich for their own sake, with a few crumbs to the poorest. And here the very rich are Russian, making fortunes in casinos and brothels, so it is just right to steal billions of decent currencies from them, though it is bad to forget paying one's income tax to the British Treasury.<br /><br />The film is simple but effective. We kind of know from the very start who Alexander Pierce may be, but that's not important at all because what is essential is how that thief who nicely put several billions of some good currencies in his pocket directly from the coffers of a Russian Mafioso, will evade the police and escape from the real Russian gangsters.<br /><br />There is no depth in all that but there is a lot of fun and action. It is also so realistically critical of the world's polices that it turns funny somewhere. The English police are only interested in recuperating the income tax that was not paid. The French police are whipping other cats, as they say in French, and looking the other way. The Italian police are only attracted by the profit they can make out of selling their prisoners to the highest bidder. Only Interpol, or a couple of Interpol agents are honest, though some might already be too high a count. Only one in fact and as long as the game is funny and paid for by his authorities.<br /><br />The most difficult part is to convince the girlfriend that she is just doing what she has to do, according to the letters he has delivered to her regularly when there is a bend or turn along the way. Ha has spent one million dollars having his own face restructured somewhere in Brazil, or Latin America, and she does not know what he looks like any more. She is an Interpol agent and he can count on her being able to resist anything including violence and her being very creative in her actions. And she does not disappoint us, and probably not our Alexander Pierce.<br /><br />While she is going from one station to the next according to his instructions, he is getting close to her and observing her and getting the protection she can get from Interpol who are protecting and following her, just like a pack of dogs would follow the smell of a fox. In fact the scent is that of a vixen in this case since Interpol, or the Russian gangster do not know the scent of the fox since he has spent a fortune to change his physical parameters.<br /><br />And everyone will be happy. The Russian Mafiosi will be all dead, as dead as a bunch of door nails, though not enough nails to nail down their coffins. The British cops will recuperate the 744 million pounds of overdue tax money they wanted to get out of the business. The beautiful Elise will be reunited to her mysterious Alexander Pierce. Alexander Pierce will be able to sail away with no one on his tracks any more.<br /><br />That's a pure action film done in the best immoral tradition of the morality one can find in robbing the rich. It is their fault any way. They would not be robbed if they were not rich. Let them give everything away and follow Jesus on his way to Capharna&uuml;m or Jerusalem. Unluckily today's rich people are not like the tax collector Matthew. They don't believe in giving their money away and they prefer losing their lives rather than not retaliating against some one who borrowed a few billions from their coffers with the intention of not bringing them back. There is a Zorro in the heart of every good citizen.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUnot know what he looks like any more.

1423113381|3.0|When I saw that this series had been written by the same author as Percy Jackson, naturally, I had to buy it. I was sort of disappointed. It took me a long to to read and I could not get into it. It was kind of boring. The Egyptian gods idea was cool and I though that the idea of them taking a human host was cool. But other than that, I didn't like it very much. I felt like this book was just bouncing around from place to place and they fought monsters. Carter and Sadie were okay, but they weren't really all that good of characters and most of the time I just sort of found them annoying and hard to connect with.<br /><br />If you liked the Percy Jackson series, you will be sorely disappointed with this book.
B002ZG980U|5.0|You will recognize at once the various matrices that have produced this film. The first matrix is of course that of all sorts of king fu and other action films that deal with real and virtual worlds intertwined into a more or less loose fabric. This one is simple to identify and follow, if follow we want to or can.<br /><br />The second matrix is naturally \\"Matrix\\", the film or rather trilogy of films. In Matrix though the three levels of reality are the underground warriors who fight against the conquest of the world by machines, the real world and the world of machines. A fourth level exist which is the result of the matrix itself: the real world of the surface is little by little conquered by a mental world \\"controlled\\" or \\"invaded\\" by a certain Mr. Smith. This mental world is the creation of some engineer behind who invented the mathematical matrix that enables his mind to take over the real world.<br /><br />None of this here. In fact we have a real team of people who are exploiting a certain capability of some human beings, themselves among others, their ability to dream and to be able to live (virtually of course) in that dreamed world. That dreaming can be controlled by some machine and is like hypnosis. The complication comes from the fact that anyone in any world can dream a deeper world that then superimposes itself onto the original world. We thus can come to five, six or seven levels of depth. This is done so fast that, and since we are constantly jumping from one level to the next, the film becomes chaotic.<br /><br />The human mind is afraid and abhors chaos. So in front of this situation we are confronted to we try to sort out the various levels and to remember which one is the first true dream, hence which one is the real world, and hence which ones are the other and deeper worlds. Don't believe in miracles. You would have to be autistic to be able to really follow every shift from one world to the next and identify them in their depth and successiveness. And that's the charm of the film. A certain balance and equilibrium is then re-established at the end when finally - but I won't say - though we have absolutely no real element to make sure that last scene is the real world.<br /><br />At another level of meaning this film, as opposed to \\"Matrix\\", has no reference or metaphor connected to any Christian myth, or as for that any mythology at all. The film then has no ethical meaning, no spiritual signification, no mental and moral depth. We are thus and henceforth floating and roaming into a vast universe of many strata with no milestone, guideline or compass to find a way out. This world is absolutely psychotic and after a period of living in that universe the characters would find it a relief to finally die. But is it that simple?<br /><br />If you died in the first level of dreaming that would wake you up in the real world. But if you died in any deeper world you will never be able to wake up in the real world, hence you would die really. The fact that suffering at any level accumulates in the real person whose personae or avatars are suffering at any dreamed level makes the experience really painful for the real persons. The psychosis would easily then induce this person to just accept to die, to commit suicide.<br /><br />The last characteristics of this film is that the main character has the capability to bring into any of his dreamed world the recollection of his wife who is really dead, or so he says, and she can play a direct role against him including enticing him to commit suicide in order to stay with her. Here the psychosis can reach a certain level of schizophrenia.<br /><br />This film then is a pure strong disorienting drug that aims at getting you out of any kind of stable vision of reality. That's what the title means and that's what the objective of the real people in the real world is: to implant ideas in the brains of other people to control them and to make them do what they want them todo, in other words to manipulate them. IN-ception is nothing but a manipulation of words like RE-ception, PER-ception, DE-ception, and many others: CON-ception, EX-ception, .... In a way it is a denunciation of the virtual universe or universes of electronic games now game-designers have been able to introduce us into their virtual reality just as if we were really in that universe made real in the process. All that is false and fake but quite a few people find it comfortable to live in such a psychotic reality, and for some of them to die there.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGIDnothing but a manipulation of words like RE-ception, PER-ception, DE-ception, and many others: CON-ception, EX-ception, ....

B003HARV3Y|2.0|Personally, I thought Chris Columbus did a pretty good job with the first two Harry Potter movies. But this movie was terrible. It was absolutely NOTHING like the book.<br /><br />First, the appearance of the actors. They were way, way too old to be playing twelve-year-olds (the actress playing Annabeth was in her early twenties when they filmed this) and Percy was the only one who looked as his character was described in the book. Annabeth had brown hair and brown eyes and her personality was nothing like Annabeth's in the book. Annabeth could be a sometimes sarcastic know-it-all, but sweet. In this, she was a fierce warrior maiden and for most of the movie, pretty mean to Percy. Grover is supposed to be a redhead, awkward, gangly, but a good friend. In this movie, he had most of the attributes of a gangster. The only person who really was anything as they were in the book was Luke, but of course, being a good actor, he wasn't in it for very long.<br /><br />My main problem though is that so much changed form the book. I'm okay with a few changes, with some books they are necessary. But this movie was pretty much nothing like the book. The only thing they had similar was the title. If they are to continue with the rest of the series, they are going to have a hard time explaining what everything is because they skipped out on a lot<br /><br />(Spoilers ahead, if you don't want the movie ruined, don't read!)<br /><br />--Kronos was not so much as mentioned in this book, which I think is pretty important. He's the main bad guy and it's going to be hard to make the movie if they don't have the main antagonist.<br /><br />--Maybe this isn't really important, but they never mentioned Luke's scar, and it sort of stemmed his turning evil because he was mad at his father for giving him such a lousy quest.<br /><br />--Grover's search for Pan isn't mentioned. It's not necessarily important to this film, but it is to the next one because it's why he gets captured.<br /><br />--Hades never shows up as some sort of flame demon at camp in the book.<br /><br />--It's never mentioned that Percy is a child of the Big Three and that's pretty important.<br /><br />--A naiad gives Percy the pearls, they don't go search for them.<br /><br />--Most of the monsters were missing from the film, such as the echidna, the Furies (the bus scene), and they added in the hydra<br /><br />--The prophecy of Percy's sixteenth birthday. It's not mentioned and Percy is all ready sixteen in the movie. They need to do something about the prophecy in the movies since it plays a big role in the books.<br /><br />If they do the second movie, I think they should get a new director because Columbus got this movie completely wrong.mp in the book.    --It's never mentioned that Percy is a child of the Big Three and that's pretty important.    --A naiad gives Percy the pearls, they don't go search for them.    --Most of the monsters were missing from the film, such as the echidna, the Furies (the bus scene), and they added in the hydra    --The prophecy of Percy's sixteenth birthday.

1416526242|5.0|This autobiography is a must-read, not only because one must have one's eyes wide open to different points of view, backgrounds, life-styles and people, but more so because it will inspire the reader to be a better person and try harder,to be humbled and encouraged at the same time by Ali's courage and integrity. She bravely highlights some issues most of the western world is virtually blind to, a champion of women living under oppression, and a feminist in the true sense of the word. What an inspiring woman, without being inacessible. No wonder she is one of the Time 100.

B001C4AFOY|5.0|This movie was simply awesome...historically accurate, beautifully shot, wonderfully acted.  This movie is not just for the history buff either!  It's the story of a vivacious young girl, her struggle to find her place in the world, and what was to become the romance of the century.  This movie shows a Victoria that hasn't been presented before, and includes some of her actual journal entries in the special features.  My wife, who generally does not share my passion for history, loves this one.  Don't miss it!!

081297381X|2.0|That black swans (and their gray brethren) exist is almost indisputable.  Unfortunately Taleb spoils this idea with a few hundred additional pages of nonsensical prose.  He expounds on the \\"narrative fallacy,\\" and falls victim to it (perhaps ironically--perhaps intentionally) with made up stories about a made up author.  He offers up the trappings of epistemic arrogance, and likewise seems to fall victim to them.  He expresses his profound distaste for statistics, and he seems to avoid entertaining the potential of his own arrogance.    Bottom line: the overall idea of black swans is a worthy essay.  Taleb's book is overdone, full of hubris, and unnecessarily critical of just about everything and everybody.  He presents some interesting ideas about our many psychological trappings as humans--then seems to fall victim to them himself.
0316044938|4.0|Susie Salmon is an innocent fourteen year old girl, who just so happens to live next door to a serial killer. On her way home from school one day, her neighbor Mr. Harvey persuades her to follow him. As she enters his underground hideout that he claims he built for the neighborhood kids, he brutally rapes and murders her. And thus begins the story of Susie's family trying to cope with their loss. The book is from Susie's point of view, looking down at her grieving family members, from heaven.<br /><br />This was a different kind of novel; not your regular whiny-teenager in a lot of YA books, or dull storyline. This one was a mix of heartache and sorrow, with a little bit of happiness and smiles sprinkled on top. The chapters alternate with each family member's personal story, and how they are trying to cope with Susie's death. There were definitely beautiful moments in the book that I distinctly remembered, and that I'll take away with me.<br /><br />The author did a fantastic job with character development. I grew so fond of Susie and her thoughts seemed so realistic, especially for a girl her age. While her younger sister grows up and experiences her first kiss, Susie feels a pang of jealousy but also happiness. The emotions are greatly stirred from this book, and it hits almost each of the emotions throughout the story. It was really interesting seeing how each of Susie's family members dealt with her death completely differently.<br /><br />But one thing to point out is how long this book seemed to be. Sometimes I just wanted to hurry up and finish the book already when the story line would drag. I definitely think some parts could be cut out, they seemed irrelevant - but that's just my opinion.<br /><br />Mr. Harvey... *shudders*. The quiet, friendly neighbor that no one would expect to be a crazed rapist. He's such an awful character, yet somehow so believable! I think the author did an amazing job with him and his personality, it fit into the story perfectly. And the ending? Wow...if I hadn't seen the movie beforehand, I would never have expected that to happen!<br /><br />This is a horrifying book yet filled with beauty and sad, but sweet sorrow. If you start it, you most definitely have to finish it.'t seen the movie beforehand, I would never have expected that to happen!

B003TJR2HS|4.0|The dockStubz Charge Converter does its job just fine and I recommend it for that reason. The one aspect that concerns me is that the lack of any added supporting structure places all the weight of the iPhone on the dock whereas if I take the iPhone our of the Otterbox case that I use and place the \\"naked\\" iPhone 4 onto the dock then the contact of the iPhone 4 case with the charging dock's surrounding structure acts to support the weight of the iPhone 4 without requiring the dock itself to bear all of the iPhone 4's weight. The reality of that design makes me wonder whether the docking station on my speakers will be strong enough to support the iPhone 4 over a couple of years of almost daily use.
1595141715|4.0|One day, Clay Jensen finds a package on his doorstep addressed to him, but with no return address. Inside there are seven cassette tapes, with a number written in chronic order on each side. As Clay starts listening to the tapes, he realizes they were recorded by Hannah Baker, his classmate and secret crush, who committed suicide two weeks ago. Hannah explains that there are thirteen reasons why she decided to kill herself, and Clay is one of them. Clay spends the rest of the night listening to all thirteen stories, and visiting places on the map Hannah left him, telling Clay where to go. He must face the truths he's tried to ignore for so long.<br /><br />This book was very compelling. It had a thick, interesting plot that right away caught my interest. A girl admitting all the reasons why she wants to end her life, and then passing on the tapes to each person the day before she goes through with it? So creative. Now, before you start thinking that she might sound \\"pitiful or whiny\\", let me explain.<br /><br />Hannah Baker's character was so...real. By the end of the book, I completely understood her and felt for her. She went through things in life that not all teenagers experience. It was a mix of betrayal, losing friends, being used, rumors and gossip being spread about her, heartbreak, witnessing rape, and more. Even though throughout the entire novel, it was only her voice speaking through the tapes, I got to know her better than the main character, Clay.<br /><br />Since there were 7 tapes, with a story on each side, that meant that 13 new characters were introduced. In some way or another, most of them were connected somehow. At times it got confusing, and I'd have to skim over the previous chapters I already read, to re-read which story went with which character. Other times I just gave up trying to remember who each person was, but it didn't really affect the overall storyline.<br /><br />This was a deeply powerful story, and I remember crying once or twice as I stayed up late at night reading, not able to put the book down. Even though the overall story is sad, dark, and depressing, I liked the satisfactory ending. It sounded....hopeful. I actually had to read the end of the last chapter two or three times before finally getting it in my head that the book was over. Because I didn't want it to be!<br /><br />I really recommend this book to mature readers for both boys and girls. Hannah Baker's stories will hit your heart hard, and leave you breathless. This book highlights how important it is to think before you act. And some great morals and values, like the consequences of your bad actions, are put to the test.

0545123275|4.0|Ever since Grace was just a little girl, she's been fascinated by the wolves living in the woods behind her house. Especially one in particular - the yellow-eyed one that always watched her, too. After their silent obsession with each other for years, they finally meet. In person.<br />Sam, ever since he was bitten by a wolf as a boy, is a werewolf. During the hot temperature of summer he is human, but during the frigid cold of winter, he transforms into a wolf. But this year is Sam's last year of being human, and as the winter comes closer and closer, the young couple must fight to prevent him from turning back into a wolf. Even if it means risking their lives.<br /><br />I didn't really know what to expect for this book. Besides the Twilight saga, this is the only other werewolf book I've ever read. Maggie Stiefvater's writing was beautifully written. She detailed every paragraph, easily letting me visualize the story in my head.<br /><br />The novel is told through both Grace and Sam's perspective. But what I loved about the book was that both of their characters were so distinctive, that I was able to tell who was telling the story even without reading the chapter titles (which told which character's POV it was in.) It wasn't distracting at all, and included more incite into their character. Sam was an amazing character - he had such a kind, innocent, and friendly personality. But at times, I almost wanted to find a fault in him. I don't like it in books when there is the \\"perfect and flawless\\" boyfriend who every girl obsesses over and wants for themselves. Sure, that'd be great, but we must remember he's fictional! Only once in the book do Grace and Sam have an argument, and it only lasts one page - until Grace forgives him because of the sad look on his face. I mean, really?? Sorry, but that's not realistic at all. Especially since we're talking high-school teenager couples.<br /><br />I really liked Grace's strong and smart character. She stood up for herself and didn't take no for an answer. Sam and Grace complemented each other, and were made for each other. Their love was refreshing, and the author wrote it very descriptively. Each kiss they shared was written differently, and felt right, not awkward like some romance books do. They had great chemistry.<br /><br />The ending was very abrupt. I actually kept reading even after the \\"acknowledgments\\" and \\"about the author\\" pages, looking to see if I had somehow missed a page. I kept going back and forth the last chapter, re-reading pages, to see if I had missed something. I wasn't satisfied with the ending and had MANY unanswered questions. This book begs for a sequel, and I'm pretty sure this is going to be a series. So that's a good thing - because this ending was very unsettling.<br /><br />The cover? GORGEOUS. It's one of my most favorite covers, and I love the different shades of dark blues, not to mention the hidden wolf in the bottom corner! (I actually didn't even see it at first since it blended in so nicely.) And it wasn't until after I read the book that I understood why there was a drop of blood for the letter 'i' in the title. That was a nice touch.<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed the novel. Maggie Stiefvater's flowing, almost poetic, style of writing was so descriptive and the characters were beautifully written. The plot dragged at times, and I was ready for something new to happen, but after awhile that wish came true. There were some great twists, and I'll definitely be picking up the sequel - Linger, which comes out in 2010, I believe?answer. Sam and Grace complemented each other, and were made for each other.

B003EY7IRC|5.0|Oh what a journey, from the original Highlander series to the Fever series. I have read and hung on every word in each book. You can not go wrong with Ms. Moning and her books. I got the first fever book as a freebie and didn't expect to get hooked. After I read each of the Fever books, I realized that it was a spin off of the Highlander series, so of course I had to go back and read each book in the correct order. I waited, not so patiently, for the final Fever book to come out. As soon as it was released, I bought it and devoured every word. O.M.G. It was a bitter sweet experience. I loved it something fierce, but hated that it was the end of the Fever series. After stressing about it for about a day, I read that she is already working on the next book which will pick up with the characters that are left hanging. You will not be disappointed by this twisting and turning adventure. I dare not continue gushing, for fear of spoiling the book for any future readers.

B0036EH3XE|5.0|I've seen every season of Lost at least twice now, and it all makes perfect sense to me.  Okay, it makes enough sense.  It makes all the sense it needs to.  All the remaining unanswered questions don't matter to me.  \\"Who built the statue of Tawaret?\\"  I don't care, it's not important.  \\"Why Tawaret?\\"  I don't care, doesn't matter.  \\"Does the statue being broken have anything to do with the pregnancy problems?\\"  Chronologically speaking, it seems unlikely, but still, don't care, doesn't matter.  \\"What about Walt? WAAAAALLLLT!  WAAAALLLLT!\\"  Sheesh, you guys have been wailing about Walt since season one.  Don't care, doesn't matter.

B003EY7IRC|4.0|I am a long-time fan of Karen's, but I will not, just because I enjoy an author, give false praise where it does not belong. So, that said, this review will be honest, direct, and will tell you what I genuinely thought, good and bad, even at the risk (without intent) of offending Karen (whom I've actually even met along with her husband).  So, here it goes:    Shadowfever cannot be reviewed in a vacuum because it is the culmination of a 5-book series and must be reviewed in that context. Shadowfever was much better than I expected because I was honestly disappointed by Dreamfever, the 4th book in the series (which I also reviewed here - and the fact that Mac & Barron had a lot of sex in that book could not overcome what I felt it was lacking in plot development).     I LOVED the 1st three books in the series (Darkfever, Bloodfever & Faefever). After it got going past a slow start, Shadowfever definitely held my rapt attention right to the end. It had intriguing plot twists that no one had guessed. And shocking, sometimes quite abrupt surprises. I would still say that Dreamfever and the first portion of this book contained a lot of unnecessary and sometimes annoying filler. The series would have been better cut down to four action-packed, heart-wrenching, gripping books.     But, the series is filled with complex and well-developed characters, who come alive in a vibrant world to live through an excellent plot that becomes quite real for the reader. There are many sides to the characters, good and bad, and many reasons why some do bad for good reasons or good for bad reasons.  In the end, it would be hard to pick a single villain or hero from the cast. Shadowfever provides essentially all the critical answers people will need for closure (except a few details and technically \\"what\\" Barrons is). It ends with a few things left in the air to allow for new plots and a continuing storyline, but not a cliffhanger. So, this is really not an end to stories in the Fever Worldor with these characters. But, do the fans really want that anyway?     Shadowfever (except the first approx. 20%) moved well and provided substantial closure. My main issue with Shadowfever and with the series as a whole was that it never provided the development of the relationship between the main characters. Some folks are just so desperate to have an HEA (happily ever after), that as long as the two presumed lovers end up together and/or have sex, they're happy. But, I require more or I'd rather there not even be an HEA. It needs to develop enough to make sense.  There really was no transition or reason for the change of emotional development for either of the main characters. I hate you, I treat you like crap, I fight with you, We have sex, You're my whole life, I will die without you. That was a jump on the intellectual level of a playground romance. I kick you therefor I love you. I needed far more to make the leap with them.     Overall, I had closure with this book, but the relationship was not fulfilling for me at all. That is why I cannot give this book 5 stars. It never tied up the loose ends of what was totally lacking in the relationship throughout this series and remains lacking to the end. However, I will read the next book Karen writes, as I've read everything else.    P.S. As an overall comment on all the books in the series, including this one: You may or may not like the way it is written from the 1st person point of view at times. When some of the characters get whiny or emotional, if you would not like that in person, it may annoy you to read. It does immerse you in the character and their perspective. But, depending on your personality, you may want to tell them to \\"shut up\\"! So, that is the risk the author chose to take.

0385341679|5.0|KMM definitely gave this reader a explosive and satisfying finale to her series.  I read this book from cover to cover and absolutely loved it.  I've been so obsessed with Jericho Barrons ever since the first book, Darkfever.  Like the other reviewers, I could also read a book where Barrons does taxes, laundry, cleaning...anything.  He is such a fascinating character.  At first, I was irritated that we weren't able to REALLY find out what he and his band of merry men were.  But after I finished it, I realized that part of the reason why I love him so much was his mystery.  I'm glad that there is still a cloud of mystery surrounding this.....man?  When we get Ryodan's story, I bet we will find out more about their past.      What I really love about Shadowfever is that she kept Barrons true to his character.  He is not gentle and soft, and even when Mac and Barrons admit their feelings for one another, she did not turn him into a harmless puppy (hello...Acheron anyone?).  The last 100pgs of the book....WOW...  The revelations about V'lane, meeting the the Unseelie King, who Mac is is incredible.  I was surprised to find myself LOVING how Karen wrote the Unseelie King and how much I like him.  The dialogue was brilliant.    Thank you Karen for not letting your readers down.  This book was smart, wonderfully written, dark, fantastical and believable.  What a shame for this journey to end.  I cannot wait for the books on Dani, Ryodan and Christian.

Demanding excellence from your children is OK!!!! If more U.S. parents were like Ms. Chua and stopped skirting their responsibility of RAISING THEIR KIDS, we wouldn't be in the mess we are in today! Ms. Chua's approach may seem extreme, but it has worked for her. Above all, I commend her for taking the time to be a parent and not letting the TV, daycares, etc raise her children.     So often we come home from a long day of work and it's easy to veg out in front of the TV or let your children do it b/c spending quality time with them takes ENERGY!!!! Instead we 'bond' by watching TV together or going to the movies. By keeping her kids active and not hanging out ie sleepovers, etc with kids whose parents HAVENT put the time into raising their kids she has eliminated potential bad influences. I respect the decision and will consider doing it myself as well. I don't know how effective all her methods will be for others, but I commend her efforts. She has given her children the most valuable gift a parent can give, and that is her time. Spend time with your kids people!

145283668X|5.0|Most people who are at all interested in classic literature are familar with the most basic outline of this story.  Not everyone has actually bothered to read the book for themself.  On the surface is the tale of someone's darker nature - an oversimplified summary of a story with several levels.  I challange you to look deeper and read thoughtfully.  You'll find a wealth of questions to ponder.  What is the root of evil deeds; human nature or the cultures created by humans that force people to repress artifically-designated \\"unacceptable\\" behaviors until a person breaks under the pressure?  Packaged in a story that would outperform many modern \\"thrillers,\\" this book is worth reading and re-reading.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I read alot. I have read MANY great books and series, but none of them have EVER compared to the PRETTY LITTLE LIARS series. It is the absolute best in the world!!!! Full of detail, excitment, mystery, murder, love, and the game of life, these girls will stop at nothing to get to the bottom of this lie. Please read this amazing series, you will be pulled in by Sarah Shepards amazing ability to write.   -A ;)
0399226907|5.0|I remember the first time my kindergarten teacher read The Very Hungry Caterpillar to the class. We were all fascinated by this colorful book about a caterpillar who eats his way through a lot of food, then becomes a butterfly. Until the last couple of months, I hadn't picked up the book since 1990. But when I saw it at the store, I got it off the shelf to read to my daughter, and see if she liked it as much as I did then. Sure enough, she did. This is just a charming little book. It might not be much of a story book for bed time or anything, but it's definitely a neat one to look at.<br /><br />The book is just a few pages long, but it tells the short story about a hungry little caterpillar who isn't satisfied when he eats a lot of fruit, so he moves on to snacks and what most people consider junk food, which makes him huge. The caterpillar then makes its cocoon, and emerges as a beautiful butterfly.<br /><br />This book is for very young children, as you can see by the reading level in the product details here. It's best for babies to pre-schoolers, though it was quite fine with a kindergarten class too. Unless you're in an area that has a lot of caterpillars and butterflies, some kids aren't exposed to them much or know that caterpillars tun into butterflies, so this is a great book to show that. And like I stated above, the artwork is fantastic. Eric Carle has a very distinct style, going with tissue paper rather than pencil, ink or paint. Simple things like a hot dog or plum look great in their own right with this style, and even now as a hopeful children's book author, I admire this artwork. I also love how the caterpillar shows no emotion, except for when its eaten too much and you can tell he has a pretty bad tummy ache.<br /><br />But there is one thing that's throwing off a lot of people who order this book, and it's the same thing that happened to me with The Very Busy Spider. Only in the product details do you see the size of the book listed. Most peoplewould assume that these books are your more regular book size, rather than a mini version that fits in your back pocket. Sometimes the edition of the book isn't mentioned in the item title either, so please read the product details before placing an order so you don't end up disappointed when a tiny book arrives.<br /><br />The Very Hungry Caterpillar is a book that most children will enjoy, and is a nice one to look at in the car, grocery shopping, or as a prep for a bigger bedtime book. Eric Carle just has that magic touch of making simple, short stories that are memorable for years to come...with a big help from colorful tissue paper!

0596806027|4.0|HTML: Up and Running by Mark Pilgrim from OReilly.com Publications    If only a few words were the key to opening up immediate production in HTML5. \\"HTML5: Up and Running\\" is one of few books that comes close to explaining that path in the least amount of words.    Some people don't care about HTML, no less HTML5. Some people are wearing the new badge of HTML5 code right out on their sleeves. Like the W3C.    They are so excited - they commissioned a slick, sexy HTML5 logo website while waiting for the final HTML5 tablets to come down from the mount... on the way to us... some eon from now.    The ease of this new markup is exemplified in the comfort that the binders of books, as well as the web authorities, feel in allowing us all to dip our hands in while the batter is still being stirred on HTML5.    `HTML5: Up and Running' from O'Reilly.com is not afraid to dish it out in economical slices. In the speedy evolution of technical web publications, `Up and Running' is a mid-step to larger, more verbose books that are just hitting the market. Released early enough to be modest in page quantity but dense enough to explain all the essential aspects, a cheeky dash of humor is included inside for free.    Myself, as a communications designer, I am very happy with the way charts and diagrams are designed consistently through the book. I love the horizontal comparison charts that measure browser compatibility. The design helps to distinguish this information from the stacks of code throughout the text. As an illustrator, I'm dying to get HTML5 Canvas carved into my brain cells. This is a good introduction to forming images via markup but I need more visuals to really know how that happens outside of the flattened page. I'm reading the book in bound and PDF formats. Great advantages to the copious hyperlinks in the PDF format. Bound version is small and easy to slip into the bag for educating yourself on the fly.    efitzsmith.com
B003EY7IRC|3.0|I expected more.  I read this on Kindle.  She wastes words with Mac dribble from chapters 2 - 40.  Finally, the story picks up once more in Chapter 41.  But after all of this, the ending is lacking, almost anti-climactic.  The lie that Mac tells Barrons made me think of him as some kind of Harlequin novel chump.  The JZB that I had come to expect and adore through KMM's writing was no more.  Dani was ALWAYS annoying to me; I don't think that KMM truly understands someone at that age.  She spends so much time on Dani only to leave that situation unanswered for the most part.  I do hope that the rumors are true and that she write another novel focusing on one of the other characters.

B00406UK7S|3.0|Lately there have been a lot of movies about the Roman Empire's reach into the British Isles.  There was the King Arthur retelling with Clive Owen and Keira Knightley.  And soon after that was Colin Firth in the Last Legion.  Now we have Centurion, about a group of surviving roman centurions who struggle to reach friendly ground after their legion is destroyed by Picts.  Combining great scenery, bloody violence, raucous humor with betrayals and backstabbing, this movie shows life in the Roman Empire as brutal and bloody.  And yes, we have warrior babes, more than in previous sword-fighting movies.  The soundtrack was a disappointment; for a movie with scenery and cinematography like LOTR, the background music was totally forgettable.  Outside of that, this was an above-average action flick.
B002ZG99N6|4.0|The Town was one of the best films of 2010 and given the large number of solid films, especially in the second half of the year when The Town came out, that is saying something.  What I did like is that Ben Affleck the director lets each of these actors play to their strengths so that we are seeing to a large degree Jeremy Renner's performance in Hurt Locker again and we're seeing Jon Hamm channel Don Draper into his role.  I think this is also a great way for Pete Postlethwaite to go out.  His quite menace is amazing.     I can only offer two things that keep this from being 5 stars.  The first is that Ben Affleck as an actor just can not hold his weight with this crowd. He comes across as wooden and stiff and it's obvious that the great performances of others is pulling him along. He needs to stick to directing.  Also, speaking as a native of Boston, I have to say the North End and Fenway Park robberies border on the almost comic. I don't hold it against the film it's one of those things you have to let go to enjoy the film but I did laugh at how they were driving in the North End. Trust me when I say you would get all of two blocks before you were killed.  But still enjoy a well done thriller.
0307454541|2.0|I don't know what the hype was about this book.  A lot of rubbish and the writing wasn't impressive, nor the story.  I love a good mystery and I already was about 2/3's through the book before I thought, \\"oh I want to keep reading and not go to bed\\" but after a few pages, I was highly disappointed.  Maybe it was the translation. I just don't know what the big sell was and I have read much better mystery books and the writing style was very elementary. A big disappointment, I couldn't even feel for the characters-No character development.  I kept thinking ok, this will lead to this,and it might get better but it never did.  Too much jumping around. I will not read the remaining two books. Sorry :(

0316098337|2.0|Even though I liked the concept of a POV of a 5 year old, I was skeptical from the outset how this was going to be accomplished.  Having read the book, I can tell you my skepticism was warranted.  The author never came across convincingly like a 5 year old.  Even if you put aside all the inconsistencies in grammar, the almost savante-like insights into humanity, etc, I never felt that the author captured how a 5 year old processes the world.  I have 2 school age kids, and I just didn't buy it. Kid's don't have that sort of inner monologue at that age, so to see it in print just seemed implausible.  It was difficult for me to look past that major detail of the novel, so from then on, the book just seemed pretty silly.  I felt like I was reading a high school creative writing assignment.  But let's put the issue of a 5 year old point of view aside.  Even if I could have overcome that, I still would not have been able to accept innumerable elements of the story line that seemed beyond the pale.  The circumstances of the escape seemed implausible, as did the way in which Ma and Jack were treated by all the people they encountered, as did some of the events that happened to Jack (come on would they really take Jack to the Mall without telling the mother, on his first outing in society????)It all seemed pretty dumb to me.   I gave it more than one star since I did manage to finish it - but I can't really say I found this book enlightening or believable on any level.  Now had this story been told from the mother's point of view, I would have been more interested because I think the author could have pulled it off more convincingly.  I'd rather read the true biography of some of the recent real-life captivity stories than this novel which was really just drivel to me. Sorry.

B000LTAY1U|5.0|I was afraid that the green would be too green... well, the face is very very dark green.  (You can easily replace the band to a different color such as brown or black and the people will not be able to tell the face is green unless they pay attention)   The band is a little thin but you can always change that.  The  band is a good quality and well built.  The watch has a good solid weight, yet it is thin enough to wear with a dress shirt.  I'm giving 5 stars because it is an excellent value for the price.    UPDATE:  I originally gave 5 stars, but I have been wearing the watch all day under a normal condition.  It gained 4 min per every hour (yes, per hour).  I read another user having the same issue.  this is not normal.  I will try again for a couple of more days.  If the condition does not improve I will return the watch.  I still like the color and the looks of the watch. :)    UPDATE 2: It has been a week since I wore this watch.  I have been wearing it for the last 2 days and the time is accurate.  Am I going crazy?  I left it on my desk for the last week or so (with face up flat).  I was going to return but decided to test it out once again.  It keep accurate time for the first hour so I kept on wearing (including overnight)as of today it gained +-15sec (within 48 hours).  It is amazing.  I'm very glad!  I read about automatic watches needing \\"break-in\\" time or \\"adjustment-period\\"... so I guess it is true... or maybe it was magnetized during shipment.. or maybe it was stored side ways for a long-time.... well, I don't know since I'm not a watch specialist or anything....   I just want to tell you that it works.  If I want an accurate time I would go with Quartz.  My rating is going back up to 5 stars!

0061537934|5.0|One of the best books I've read this year.  It is basically a story about an everyday man and the struggles and misfortunes in his life, but is told from his dog's perspective.  It is a story of the man's life, which is interesting and disturbing at parts, but there are a few scenes in the book that doglovers everywhere will appreciate, as the author tries to explain why our pets sometimes behave in inexplicable ways.  It adds some humor to an overall sad story.  Well worth reading!
1594202842|1.0|Yes it is a memoir, beautifully written. Yes, Chua was a product/victim of her own upbringing and rather than dealing with the emotional fall-out, went into a brainy profession in a brainy institution to protect herself from herself. Chua is emotionally abusive as a mother, if not physical. Being beaten with chopsticks for speaking in English at home, Chua is a product/victim of domestic violence herself and can't see the trees in the forest she hides in. This title of \\"Tiger Mom\\" is a shield, an excuse for abuse against helpless children. The point of parenting is not to get kids into Carnegie Hall by the age of 14. That's the old joke of the tourist asking someone in NYC how to get to Carnegie Hall and the response is \\"practice, practice, practice!\\" I mean Malcolm Gladwell talks about the 10,000 hours needed to excel in most any field so it's no surprise it takes that to get to Carnegie Hall.  But a bathroom break takes 1 minute and is the least of lawful requirements and so Chua broke the law and would have been hauled into Child Services/Protection had her husband been smart enough to pick up the phone. He's probably so brow-beaten and shell-shocked he can't find the phone. The only thing good about this book taking up so much media ink is that parents are reminding themselves why we stopped treating children like second-class citizens.  She makes some real compelling points. But she also has a very anti-social reputation around Yale Law School and so I think she is mostly passing on her social anxiety onto her kids rather than dealing with it. No sleepovers okay. No playdates... not so much. She is trying to raise clones of herself and luckily her second-born is giving her a run for her money. She should also pick up with phone and call 911 if she every tries that stuff again.  We know there is some physical punishment going on in that home. A kid who is beaten with chopsticks for speaking English and doesn't give her child bathroom breaks is going to be physically hurting her children at some point in the day. I hope her husband sobers enough to make the call.  Or her daughter(s)!

B003EY7IRC|2.0|You won't read four books to stop at the finale, so this is not a review of persuasion, but expectation.  I loved every book before this one and had such high expectations...In short, I just ended up being frustrated throughout the entire book. I was waiting for that \\"Ah!\\" moment but just ended up getting little \\"Oh...\\" moments.  KMM set her readers up for something spectacular and didn't deliver.  So much information was given at the end that it was difficult to appreciate it all - especially after reading an infinite amount of unnecessary thoughts that amounted to page fillers.  Like MacKayla for 80% of the book, I was left unsatisfied.

B004CLYKLI|5.0|while people may find it hard to believe, many Asians growing up as a first generation in the US did go through some, several, and even all of the things Amy writes about. it's hard to understand if you never lived it. i know i never slept at anyone's house, i played the piano, did not do sports, and belonged to the key club, honor society, yearbook, etc. and i am proud for all that. the book gives insight into Asian parenting...not all, but definitely a lot. so if you want to understand why Asians are the way they are, read it. you may never parent that way, but don't knock it...just understand.

B001MYIXAC|5.0|Oskar is ignored at home and bullied at school, but he soon finds a friend in his new neighbor next door. Eli is strange and distant at first, but as the two grow closer, she reveals that she is a young vampiress who must consume blood to survive. LET THE RIGHT ONE IN is Tomas Alfredson's beautiful and captivating adaptation of John Ajvide Lindqvist's best-selling novel. It incorporates the coming of age theme with a budding romance, while molding the classic vampire mythos into something wholly original. Alfredson's restrained shooting style is subtle but extremely effective. By paring down the color palette to a collection of cool blues and grays, he not only emphasized the frigid surroundings, but also Eli and Oskar's icy dispositions leading up to their friendship. He then contrasts the bleak coloring with saturated reds as a form of foreshadowing. Rather than simply relying on computerized imaging to display her powers, Eli's supernatural abilities are implied just off screen in a number of cleverly crafted shots. A review of the film would mean nothing without mentioning the moving performances by Lina Leandersson and Kåre Hedebrant as the two young leads. Because the majority of the picture is spent following their growing relationship, the more horrific moments become that much more shocking and unexpected. LET THE RIGHT ONE IN defies each of the recent trends in Horror by focusing on its compelling characters and touching love story over excessive amounts of gore and violence.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

B004BLTNM0|4.0|I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE has been the source of controversy for decades since its initial release in 1978. As a rape and revenge film, it belongs to a very specific sub-genre of cinema that many critics consider to be intolerable exploitation. On the other hand, fans of these movies must consider it to be top-ranking in this particular category. In it, Jennifer heads off to a small getaway by the lake so that she can relax and complete her work on her first novel. Her arrival draws the attention of four degenerates in town, who abduct her and repeatedly rape her out in the woods. Just when it seems she has escaped, she returns home only to find the men there waiting for her. Jennifer barely survives the brutal attacks, but rather than going to the police, she regains her strength and sets out to seduce each of the men before exacting her own bloody revenge!<br /><br />What makes I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE so powerful is that it never glamorizes the rape sequences. In fact, they are hardly bearable to watch due to Camille Keaton's harrowing screams and failed attempts to free herself. There are hints of hesitation and regret that come from several of the men that humanize the characters, which is even more dangerous than painting them to be soulless monsters since it draws them back into reality. It is not just the extreme violence against women that must critics condemn, but the manner in which the subject of rape is handled. Jennifer's independence and sexual liberation entice the men, which seems to suggest the common excuse that \\"She was asking for it.\\" They hoot and holler as they each take their turns with her, shouting \\"You want to be a man, don't you?\\" This has brought fire down on the film, since it seems to depict that Meir Zarchi's views rape as a sex act, and not as an act of power and domination. It isn't enough for Jennifer to suffer physically, but she is humiliated as well as the men mockingly read from her unfinished novel before destroying her work.<br /><br />The original title of DAY OF THE WOMAN can also help in reading the film as an underestimated but radically pro-feminist work. Jennifer is entirely independent and successful, writing for a number of women's magazines before setting off to complete her own novel. Her sexual freedom is a demonstration of a progressive society where women are treated equally to men (though the men in this story try to restore prior order). Even during the attacks, Jennifer is never depicted as being weak. She struggles with all of her might, but she is overwhelmed and outnumbered. After, she becomes that much stronger and more cunning, and she uses that strength to emasculate and eviscerate her adversaries. At the heart of any rape and revenge story is the revenge, and being that this is a Horror movie, Jennifer's revenge is swift and painful. Each of the men suffer a terrible death at her hands, the worst of which involves a knife and a bathtub as she takes the lead villain's manhood in hand.<br /><br />I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE remains an undisputed classic in the rape and revenge genre, and its notoriety as such has kept it banned in countless countries around the world for over thirty years. To say that it is nothing more than despicable exploitation, however, is to blindly overlook many of stronger points that Meir Zarchi brings to the screen.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Moviesitle of DAY OF THE WOMAN can also help in reading the film as an underestimated but radically pro-feminist work.

B003R0MF1C|5.0|Few \\"law and order\\"-type shows leave one with a profound sense of knowing the characters' family lives like the back of their hand anymore. (This isn't the days of \\"Cagney & Lacey\\"-type programs, after all.) Few make the heartstrings pull when it's time to go off the air for good, but this one did. I have watched the show since the beginning of it's run, not always faithfully (especially when their time & day kept changing) but I have seen the last two seasons without missing an episode. It was an exceptionally well-crafted show, especially when one considers the premise- focusing on a psychic who works for the D.A.'s office, has a husband, three kids & lives in Phoenix, AZ. Not exactly thrilling, based on that bare description. But the combination of polished, powerful, talented & yet understated acting combined with more surprises in the plots than curves in a West Virginia back road kept this going for seven seasons.<br /><br />I am single & child-free, but the family element of \\"Medium\\" is what made it most memorable for me. The seventh season left Joe & Allison at odds more often than before as career, age & family changes caused them to look at life anew. We saw Ariel head off to college (and her real-life portrayer head off the show, too). Joe's mother also left the canvas. Both actresses departed in ways that played out beautifully, but nonetheless sadly, for the viewer. Allison, Manuel Devalos & Joe Scanlon faced great challenges both in their work environment & in their personal relationships, and the tests thrown at them created much of the show's tension. Det. Scanlon became even more of a well-rounded character to me this year, as his weaknesses somehow also became his strengths. Devalos, who was sympathetic even when in the wrong, provided the program with a strong career anchor for Allison while also keeping her impulsiveness in check.

B000002OX7|5.0|The Who is one of the legendary bands that I have sadly overlooked over the years. Aside, from The Who By Numbers, I remained ignorant and stayed away from their other albums. I don't know why. Maybe it was because I just wasn't interested in their music. Well, now that I'm more open-minded, I've taken the chance and explored Who's Next, and it's been a HUGE pleasure. I can safely say that this album is just excellent. I know that I've heard snippets of \\"Baba O'Riley\\" and \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" now and then, but I've never heard them in full. Now, I can revel in the music completely, and it's a great experience. The other songs (such as \\"Behind Blue Eyes,\\" \\"Getting in Tune,\\" and \\"Bargain\\") are also brilliant. The only songs that are fairly weak are \\"Love Ain't For Keeping\\" and \\"Going Mobile,\\" but it's nothing bad. This is an excellent album by The Who, and it makes me want to explore their other albums.<br /><br />Grade: 9.5/10
B001R4SYPG|5.0|This recording has some incredible historical significance to it. Forget about minimalism -- I first started wondering about Terry Riley's \\"In C\\" because Pete Townshend of The Who said it was the inspiration for his synthesizer riff on the classic rock anthem \\"Baba O'Riley\\". It was only later that I started to understand things like Philip Glass or Steve Reich and to realize that Terry Riley fit into that tradition as well, and how significant it really was that \\"In C\\" is recognized by many as either the first or one of the first minimalist compositions.<br /><br />Listening to the piece on this recording -- the first ever made of \\"In C\\" and featuring Terry Riley himself on saxophone -- I could definitely hear the connection to music in the more popular minimalist vein. There are brief sections -- perhaps no more than half a minute or so at a stretch -- where I felt the music could actually have been written by Philip Glass if it weren't for the more rambunctious instrumentation. Of course, after a while something uncontrolled breaks out in the structured chaos of this piece that reminds you firmly that this is something else, something less refined and domesticated than mainstream minimalism.<br /><br />The instrumentation really is something. I listened to the piece before reading about it, and I really thought there must be a gamelan in there, but sadly there is not. In addition to a piano pulse, the instruments are saxophone, oboe, bassoon, trumpet, clarinet, flute, viola, trombone, vibraphone, marimbaphone. But there is definitely a gamelan-like effect that for me recalled Balinese/Javanese music.<br /><br />This is not music I'd listen to every week, but still I highly recommend it. Yes, in part the recommendation is due simply to the historical significance -- but I also found myself enjoying it much more the second and third time around than the first. It definitely makes me want to seek out more performances of the work. Good stuff, especially for intellectualizing types. For pure emotional content and a more visceral satisfaction, or for beauty as traditionally conceived, you should probably look elsewhere.e emotional content and a more visceral satisfaction, or for beauty as traditionally conceived, you should probably look elsewhere.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|January 22nd, 2011<br /><br />There is no filler on this CD to me and even my least favorite track has grown on me and has a wonderful bridge. That song is track 9 \\"I'd Like To\\". The album has a great, innocent feel to it and is super-relaxing to listen to. I just bought it here last night for 5 dollars because I only had a few of the tracks and you can color me very impressed. I even want the follow up which I'm sure doesn't completely compare since it leans more away from R&B. However, I love her voice and \\"Are You Here\\" the first track starts [[ASIN:B002X78CB2 The Sea]] off just right. I love the building up to the bridge.<br /><br />Anyway, enough about that album, let's finish speaking on this one. Like I've said there is definitely not a filler track in sight and I currently have all tracks rated at at least a 4 out of 5 on iTunes.<br /><br />I will give you some of my favorites:<br /><br />Track 10 \\"Butterfly\\" is the absolute gem of the album. I just let the tears flow as the song played because of its charming vibe. The song speaks on Corinne's childhood and how she had such a loving home that \\"was her chrysalis\\" that nurtured her growing up.<br /><br />Track 1 is \\"Like A Star\\" and that song is beautiful too. We've all heard it.<br /><br />Track 3 \\"Put Your Records On\\" is surprisingly my second favorite track. I recall when it first came out I didn't really like it but now I can appreciate its beautiful, breezy and effortless quality.<br /><br />Track 6 \\"Call Me When You Get This\\" is very wishful. Love this look on love.<br /><br />Track 7 is \\"Choux Pastry Heart\\" which I've had for a while. Although I've liked it, it didn't get that much play before. I love it now. The melancholy mood is great.<br /><br />Track 11, the final track is \\"Seasons Change\\". It is a wide-eyed awakening about how sometimes your mood gets so deep, and you feel like nothings left. But hold on Corinne encourages. Patience is a virtue.<br /><br />This album is spectacular. Brilliant really. I GET the hype. I really do. That honey-dripped voice is enough to make a grown man completely melt.<br /><br />If you are an R&B lover, go out and grab this to add to your collection very, very quickly. Don't know why you waited so long like I did. The album version to get might be the limited edition import version for some rare tracks like the perfection of a slow-burn in \\"Another Rainy Day\\" which can also be downloaded separately from the other tracks on Corinne Bailey Rae - Rarities.<br /><br />\\"A\\", 4.75 stars (or a 9.5/10).<br /><br />DOWNLOAD:<br />\\"Butterfly\\"<br />\\"Put Your Records On\\"<br />\\"Like A Star\\"<br />\\"Call Me When You Get This\\" &<br />\\"Seasons Change\\"<br /><br />SKIP:<br />None.

Do I dare say that this is the best film since Aladdin? I dare. Perhaps I my self simply have a natural predilection toward parental defiance or maybe its just any work John Lasseter touches turns to pure gold.    Every person I know who has seen this work of art was completely blown away and I salute everyone online for their in-kind expressions.    I am a bit disappointed in the \\"so called\\" professional film critics as they dare to call this film anything but pure awe inspiring magic, but they shall have their own table reserved in the internet cafe of hell to express that inspiration lacking torture they receive.

B001NLKT60|5.0|I've noticed that folks that shy away from this trilogy are nervous about the sexual violence.  I think perhaps the premise of \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" is at fault: Lisbeth Salander, a victim of sexual violence herself, helps journalist Mikael Blomkvist uncover the crimes of a sexual predator and serial killer.  If you're afraid of the grit but wonder why everyone is so in love with the trilogy, I think you could skip straight to \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire.\\"  \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" is more or less a self-contained episode, and the last two books of the trilogy are a super fascinating spy and espionage story.<br /><br />\\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\" picks up where \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" left off, but the adventures of Lisbeth Salander take a new turn as her personal past is revealed.  Her biography and the history of a illegal secret faction of the police are intricately woven.  The world Larsson creates is full of incredibly intelligent or incredibly evil characters.  It is a hyper-reality.  When I finished the first book, I couldn't wait to dive into the next.  There were so many equally important cliff-hangers that I was completely hooked.<br /><br />And I think that is the charm of the book in general.  Larsson's writing style is a tapestry, seriously.  He juggles several sub-plots at the same time.  Sometimes they intersect, sometimes they  cover two perspectives on the same slice of time.  The craftsmanship with which he unfolds the story is exactly what makes it so addictive.  There is always an open thread, and I found myself always turning the page looking forward to where that thread would lead.<br /><br />Also, I think that uneasy folks would be happy to know that Larsson is a feminist.  On the one hand it seems like falling on crimes like rape, etc. is kind of hitting below the belt.  It's too easy.  Larsson wants to create a super evil character, so he falls back on rape or porn or something to the effect.  Larsson doesn't really make his villains emotionally evil.  In other words, there is a lot of tragedy in his story, but there are no tears.  No sense of injustice that rips your heart out.  The book doesn't tug at your heart-strings.  None of the characters are emotional; they are calculating, intelligent, or over-the-top bigamists.  On the other hand, his books have several very strong, intelligent male and female characters.  There is a balance.  Mikael and Lisbeth are the two super heros; male and female.  There are male and female heroes at Milton security, male and female heroes in the police, male and female at Millennium.  So in that sense, though he falls back on crimes against women, women are fighting those crimes.llains emotionally evil.

B0018CMJSU|5.0|This is currently the most definitive version of Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece, until he or Paramount Pictures should decide to release any anniversary updates in the future.  Because both the Godfather and Godfather Part II had been digitally restored and 5.1 Dolby Digital sound mastered in place of the original mono sound, this restoration edition is the prettiest looking and best sounding of the Godfather trilogy you've seen.  The tonnes of extra features on two bonus discs themselves are worth the price of admission.  For those who already bought previous editions of the movie trilogy, a double or triple dip may not be tempting. This was my first purchase of the Godfather trilogy.  Unfortunately, I bought the DVD version because I didn't own a Blu-ray player then.  So while the Blu-ray version is definitely the recommended version for first-time buyers of the Godfather trilogy, I'm happy with my DVD set (except for some disc error on one of the bonus disks when trying to play the trailers for the Godfather and Godfather Part II) and won't double-dip for the Blu-ray version because except for the upgraded picture and sound quality, everything is the same in the DVD version.  Too bad I bought it too early or I would have gone for the Blu-ray version.

B000TGJ7ZY|5.0|As the director Francis Ford Coppola himself mentioned it, this film version of Dracula is the closest adaptation of Bram Stoker's original novel. Previous film versions either changed the characters' names, relationships or plot.  Lavish costumes, set designs, clever visual effects (relying on old technology), great music score (including the hauntingly beautiful end title theme by Annie Lennox) and generally great performances from the cast (I don't know what's the beef with Keanu Reeves' acting here? Oh, the English actress Sadie Frost is absolutely ravishing in this movie with ginger hair). Dracula here is depicted in various physical forms e.g. bat, green mist, wolf and werewolf (although I didn't like the werewolf depiction which looked more like a gorilla, or man in a gorilla suit, than wolf).    Overall, a worthwhile collector's purchase.  If you're a Dracula or vampire fan, get this!
B003EYVY0E|1.0|Unlike the Ultimate Editions for the first 2 films, this just contains the exact same version of the film as the other editions of this movie. Sure it has some great extra docs, but after creating ultimate editions that include extended editions of the film with the great docs, this is a total let down and a rip off for the price. You should just be able to buy the extra documentaries for a much lower price since anyone who is buying this already has the film on blu-ray.<br /><br />After this debacle I will not purchasing any more ultimate editions, and these, unlike the first 2 films are not ultimate editions at all.
0812973992|1.0|This book contains sections about several different groups of people, none of whom seem to have a connection to each other.

I didn't find a reason to care about any of them.
0307474275|1.0|This is, by far, the single worst novel I have ever read.  The only reason I picked it up was because it has been such a pop culture staple for so many years.  I didn't expect Crime and Punishment.  But I also didn't expect what I got.<br /><br />Remember Creative Writing 101?  What was the First Rule?  Show, don't tell.  Dan Brown skipped this class (not to mention grammar and world history).  About a third of the book is flat descriptions of his flat characters' uninteresting feelings.  Scared.  Confused.  Hungry.  Not hungry.  Thrilling stuff.<br /><br />I suppose the book would be better if there were a single real character to be found.  You know you're in trouble when the descriptions of the interior of a car are more interesting than any of the dialog.  And, as others have pointed out, the xenophobic cultural stereotypes would be offensive if they weren't so laughable.<br /><br />I've been a fan of mysteries for years.  Agatha Christie has her share of plot holes and unbelievable twists, but at least she's clever about it.  The puzzles Brown's characters are asked to solve are ridiculously simplistic.  The few chances he has to surprise his readers, Brown broadcasts his insipid twists so loudly and inelegantly that it seems he is trying to ruin what little fun there is.  Very little.<br /><br />A word of advice for Mr. Brown -- if you are going to make your main characters geniuses and world experts, it's probably best to have them get their basic facts straight.  Setting aside the ridiculous leaps of logic in his characters' interpretations of historical events, Brown can't seem to get even the simplest facts straight.  Why should I consider any assertions a British knight would make about Church history or Biblical canon when he doesn't even know the name of the bridge you can see on the London skyline?  (Hint: it's not London Bridge)<br /><br />I realize that this book is meant to be mass-market fluff.  That's in no way a bad thing; I enjoy an occasional plate of fluff.  But just because a book is meant to be light reading doesn't mean it has to insult its reader's intelligence.is meant to be light reading doesn't mean it has to insult its reader's intelligence.
0307588343|4.0|This book really helped me understand why Lehman Brothers collapsed yet other financial institutions survived or were rescued. There is some technical details about the nature of the financial instruments involved but it is presented in an easily understandable form so I didn't find it intimidating. My only negative about the book is that Larry spends an excess amount of time lionizing some of his former colleagues. I think it would have been an even more enjoyable read if he spent more time on the antics of the villains.
B0034G4P7Q|1.0|First of all - why is even Justin Timberlake in this film? Who cast him? Justin do us all a favor and stay in the music genre. Ok, beyond that, I thought the film's plot was totally undramatic - everyone knows that computer code is necessary to create proper functioning programs - but in this film it was actually a  distraction made to look exciting/cool by the having programmers drink and do shots - doubtful that even remotely happens in the real world. And speaking of unrealistic, the scene where Mark and Edourdo speak outside in the 20 degree weather looked laughably fake with what looked like special effects to create condensation on their breath (it was probably filmed in July when Harvard is on break) - next time just have the conversation in a hallway or something. Actually their mouths looked like their were expelling smoke rather than cold weather breath condensation.<br />Technically, most of the film is shot in the evening creating this irritating dark quality which the new LCD/Plasma tv's often have problems with - found this very irritating - could be different in the cinema though - something that the director had not thought through perhaps?<br />Depositions take most of the films time with flashbacks thrown in - if that is exciting to you then by all means watch it - I thought the film really fell flat on it's face - really over-hyped.

B004A8ZX14|4.0|What \\"No Strings Attached\\" lacks in originality and unpredictability is made up for in the charm and likeability of its leads. Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman not only have great onscreen chemistry, they also are individually well developed - at least, as well developed as they can be within the boundaries of a romantic comedy. It's also surprisingly funny, although it's only partly because of the well placed raunchy sex jokes; the film is one of the few recent romantic comedies to successfully find that balance between sweetness and silliness, and while that's only moderate praise for writer Elizabeth Meriwether and director Ivan Reitman, at least it's proof that they know how to take innately ridiculous material and make it accessible to general audiences.    The film is not realistic in any way, shape, or form, but that's just stating the obvious because we don't go to movies like this looking for meaning or truth. It tells the story of Adam and Emma (Kutcher and Portman), who first met as teenagers in summer camp and saw each other off and on over the next several years. In the present day, they live in Los Angeles, Adam an assistant on a TV series that crosses \\"Glee\\" with \\"High School Musical,\\" Emma a doctor at UCLA. They have successfully maintained a friendship, although there's always a flash of jealousy whenever one of them shows up with a significant other. When Adam's girlfriend dumps him for his father (Kevin Kline), he goes on a bender, makes several phone calls to women he knows ... and wakes up in Emma's apartment, naked and surrounded by Emma's friends and fellow residents.    No sex took place the night before. The morning after, however, Adam and Emma suddenly drop their defenses and just go for it. That's when they decide to take a stab at being friends with benefits; they will use each other for sex at any time of the day, but they won't commit to anything long-term. Surprisingly, this comes at the insistence of Emma, who for reasons left a little obscure is frightened by serious relationships. This is made clear in her habit of texting Adam rather than seeing him in person, a trend that has become all too real in today's smart phone society. I'll stop short of saying this movie is sending a message about technology limiting social interaction, although there are hints of it all throughout.    No more of the plot needs to be described. It goes through the motions and ends exactly the way we expect it to end. There are, however, a couple of side characters that deserve to be mentioned. One of the best is Adam's on-set colleague, Lucy (Lake Bell), who's deeply neurotic and talks at a hundred miles an hour. Making this kind of character likeable is next to impossible, and yet Bell pulls it off, probably because she understood that there's a fine line between comedy relief and annoyance. And then there are Adam's best friends, played by Chris Bridges and Jake Johnson; they aren't given all that much to do, but you can count on them for a few good male-oriented one-liners. Kline is somewhat underutilized as Adam's father, a former TV star who does drugs as if it was the 1970s and has a thing for much younger women. He's mostly just a counterpoint to his son, a way for the audience to see what Adam should not do when it comes to meeting and loving the opposite sex.    One of the film's funniest scenes is in Emma's apartment, where she and her girlfriends - along with one gay man - spend the night together in the throes of menstrual agony. Knowing they're all on the same cycle, Adam stops by with a box full of cupcakes. He also gives Emma a period-specific mix CD, with titles I probably can't repeat for the purposes of this review. There's also a moment when Emma gives Adam a Valentine's Day card, which reads, \\"You give me premature ventricular contractions.\\" I laughed hard. But then again, I was raised by registered nurses who specialized in cardiology, so I probably have an unfair advantage.    Reitman made the right choices in the casting of Kutcher and Portman, for they have that compatibility movies like this require. Kutcher is especially enjoyable and plays what may be the warmest, most caring role of his entire career. Portman is also a natural fit for this movie, which is surprising given her latest stint as a mentally ill ballerina; it's good for even the most dedicated and serious of actors to reveal that they do in fact have a sense of humor. \\"No Strings Attached\\" is by no means a great movie, and it will never be in the same league as \\"Ghostbusters\\" and \\"Ghostbusters II,\\" my two favorite Reitman comedies. But if you're in the mood for a conventional lightweight romantic comedy, this movie gets the job done nicely.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Being a machinist for over 20 years and hobby wood turner I've done a lot of tool sharpening over the years. For a low priced and easy to use blade sharpener this little thing cant be beat. It's small enough to take with you in your pocket, tool box, tackle box, glove compartment, or kitchen junk drawer and cheap enough that you can put one in each of those places and any other place that you might find a need to sharpen your knife. I bought two of them, one for myself and one for a Christmas present for my brother in-law and he likes it as much as I do.<br />  The carbide blades in this will bring the edge in pretty close to as good as you can get one and then the ceramics put a nice finish edge to your knife blade. The stinger style diamond file is perfect for the serrated blades as well. It's easy to use but you do need to be careful not to slip and slice a finger. That is the one drawback of this little jewel. Its size makes it a little difficult to hold. But with a little practice you will be able to put a very sharp edge on your pocket knife all the up to a big butcher knife. I highly recommend this for any one that wants a sharp knife. But its NOT for the Butter Fingered!

All I can say is that I felt better, had no hunger pains, no cravings, and actually am not to crazy about eating different things today even though it's my cheat day. This for a woman who constantly thinks about food and feels hungry most of the time. Dieting has been torture for me in the past. I stay active, but sit enough every day and have bad enough eating habits that I have several pounds to lose. I added the kettlebell swings to my exercise routine today and have to admit that it worked my entire body. I'm beginning to feel sore muscles all over.     I enjoy Tim's style--arrogant, cocky, funny, outrageous. That's why I bought this book. I look forward to learning some more new ideas as I move through the rest of the book.

B000MRAAJM|5.0|I'll make this brief and to the point.  We had just purchased a new large flat screen LCD television with a Blu-Ray DVD player.  I had seen the Planet Earth series before on other TV sets, and as a science series, it is very good.  So we bought David Attenborough's Planet Earth.  In a sentence, this Blu-Ray DVD should be in everyone's library, because it shows just how absolutely excellent the new LCD sets are when projecting great quality images in 1080 definition.  The detail is gorgeous and amazing.  Technically, this series from the BBC is of the highest quality in terms of content.  There are different versions with different moderators, but I like Sir David's version best.  I've seen the non Blu-Ray regular DVD version of this, and it is nowhere near as sharp in its detail.  Blu-Ray DVDs have over five times the capacity per disk compared with a standard DVD, so there is more room on it to put a video image with less compression, resulting in a much higher quality result.  I liked Blu-Ray Planet Earth so much that I later purchased the Blu-Ray Life series, also by Attenborough.  If you want to amaze visitors with the quality of your new large flat screen TV, get Planet Earth.  It is great.

0060920084|1.0|I LOVED a Walk in the Woods, and looked forward to reading this book as well, however, it was a great disappointment.        During Bryson's childhood, his father and mother set out on annual family road trips.  His father was thrifty (as were almost everyone's parents then), and they often visited free attractions during these long trips.        Many years later, Bryson, without his wife or family, sets out on a journey through America's small towns.  He decides to do it as his father did, about as inexpensively as it can be done.            Bryson visits great American locales with historical attractions, but often will not spring for the admission to those great sites, complaining that they should somehow be free.   This means that he's unable to comment about what these places represent-- he misses many opportunities to reflect, for better or worse, on American  history, culture, and life.       Bryson spends his time instead visiting one local diner or restaurant after another, making fun of a waitress' accent or the others in the diner, but not really giving meaningful insight into America, or its small towns and the people who live in them.         Bryson was clearly lonely and depressed on this trip.  He should have piled his wife and kids in the car as his father had, and set out, with a more reasonable budget.          Read this book if you want to hear the rants of a depressed guy who would rather have been home with his wife.

B001I45UFC|5.0|Lewis had such a simple, conversational tone that it's a marvel to me how vividly the characters and places come to life. I know that some people come to despise the books as adults because of the allegorical nature, but the stories are such wonderful fantasy that they'll always have a place in my heart and on my bookshelf.
B0042JH05I|2.0|I really looked forward to this video. I loved Phil's foray into Big Band jazz some years ago. The band is great, and the arrangements are in most cases as good or better than the originals. But...there are two problems.    First, the sound mix is very much the same as you might find on a CD. It doesn't sound like a live show at all. Instruments, and Phil's vocal track, are all isolated so clearly there is no evidence by listening to it without watching that it even is a live show. I like live show recordings because they have an energy and immediacy to them that studio recordings usually lack. This one has that mostly squeezed out of it.    And second...Phil is a great singer, for many styles of music. Most of the tunes he chose for this...not so much. I read he has had some physical problems, neck and spine, which are keeping him from playing drums and piano. This is somewhat evident in how he appeared to lurch around the stage, stiffly. I think it also affected his singing. Ballad singing was mainly OK, but he just simply lacked \\"soul.\\" I love this music and am about Phil's age. I know how he must feel about doing these tunes justice. For one reason or another, I just don't feel he did. If you are a diehard Phil Collins fan and you need the complete set of all his performances, this is for you. Otherwise, you may want to avoid it. I hate to say that - I think he's a great musician and performer. He just struck out on this one.
B0044430H8|1.0|I love my Tron Soundtrack. then i heard this. I was simply disgraced....what kind of composer uses 6 NOTES for a main theme? 6 notes? with razor violin in the background. It totally fits the movie. But im sorry it isnt a stand alone album like TRON. Zimmer also deserved the golden globe for inception not this 1980 garbage. Facebook went live in 2004....Mark Zuckerburg is my age. He wasnt inventing facebook in the 1980s.    Sorry Reznor this does not deserve an oscar Pixar's UP won last year and thats a masterpiece....    If you win I think the academy has pinecones up their butts. Yes its unique but not oscar worthy... Louie Louie has 3 chords written in 1955 by Richard Berry. He already created a phenomenon and a billboard for 300 weeks and covered by multiple people....better luck next time
B000FC1GJW|5.0|The Amber Spyglass is one of the best books I have ever read and I read a lot. This book was so unpredictable and it keeps you turning the pages until its done. As you read the book you go through all the motions and it feels like you are right there with the characters in the action. So, if you feel like a thriller, read this book.
6305428042|5.0|Great fun and has become a viewing tradition at our house during the halloween!  The 'black River'!  I love it!  Thats what I always called streets even before this movie came out.    Its not Halloween without this movie.

B000SEGTI0|5.0|After a few recent misses with either classic science fiction (The Foundation Trilogy) or more recent and highly loved work of the same genre (_The Diamond Age_, _Snow Crash_).  I took up this book.  I took it up because the only other Dick I read I didn't really like  -- but it was the alternate history _The Man in the High Castle_, not a work of science fiction.<br /><br />I had begun to think that I didn't like science fiction, I just really liked Kurt Vonnegut.  I picked up the Dick once more because my fellow Chicagoan deserved a second chance.<br /><br />I am glad I did.<br /><br />This book's storyline may be in the national conscious because of the fourteen different versions of _Blade Runner_ drift in the ether.  You can see the influence, but this isn't _Blade Runner_.  I'm stuck trying to say if one was better than the other, so I will just hedge and say that both creations have their merit.  Dick draws great characters to go with the world he creates, a big plus for me because I want to see both the world and the effects this world has on the people.  Aside from a few relics of the time he was writing -- widespread tobacco use, patriarchal gender relations -- the world is thoroughly modern.  And the kicker, modern but not over-explained.  I fit in, and I liked it.<br /><br />Buy this book; read this book.
B0020BUWX2|4.0|Why I Read this Book: I had learned about If I Stay earlier this year. At first, I wasn't planning on reading it because it sounded too morbid. But then I had read a few books about death (like Before I Fall by Lauren Oliver and Thirteen Reasons Why by Jay Asher) and found that I enjoy a good thought-provoking read. These types of books really make you think about life and what really matters. (You also start to notice how the little things can make an impact on others.) So I went out and bought If I Stay but it ended up sitting on my shelf for quite a while. Then I read Kelli's review and that brought this book to the top of my TBR pile.    What I Liked: The transitions from current day to Mia's flashback memories are seamless. The story flows along beautifully and you get a bit of history of each person in Mia's life. Each memory holds a certain weight on her decision. The emotion is easy to feel, right off the page. If I Stay is a thought-provoking read about love, life, death, grief, and guilt. I've got a soft spot in my heart for Teddy. I cried the most when I read about him.    What I Didn't Like: I think my expectations might have been too high going in. It wasn't as moving as I thought it would have been. It was lacking a certain je ne sais quoi. It was an emotional, thought-provoking read; it just wasn't packing the punch I thought it had. Nevertheless, it was still a good read. I enjoyed reading If I Stay but I just didn't love as much as I thought I was going to, which surprised me.    Overall Impression: If you have this book on your bookshelf, you have to ask yourself, just like I did, what are you waiting for? If I Stay reminded me of the movie Just Like Heaven. If you liked that movie then you'll enjoy reading this book. Speaking of movies, film rights for If I Stay have been purchased by Summit (they made Twilight). Definitely a movie I would like to see float from the pages onto the big screen. There are some very interested elements that I would like to see come to life. And I am definitely looking forward to reading Where She Went, the sequel to If I Stay. The blurb sounds really good!
B003102IR4|5.0|Five HUGE stars for this spectacular CD.  I first got into Bob Marley in 1984 when I bought \\"Legend\\" on cassette (remember those...lol).  I wore out 2 copies within a year.  When I finally got a CD player, one of the 1st CD's I purchased was \\"Legend:Bob Marley & Wailers\\".  Unfortunatly it didn't contain some versions of some of the songs I first heard & loved, including MY favorite version of \\"Buffalo Soldier\\".  I looked for YEARS for these versions, & always came up empty.  When I found this gem I immediately bought it, & have been playing it, & downloaded it into my iPod.  This is one of the best CD's of all time IMO.  It contains ALL of the remixed versions from the original US copy of \\"Legend:Bob Marley & Wailers\\".  Those are : \\"Buffalo Soldier\\", \\"Jamming\\", \\"Waiting In Vain\\", & \\"Exodus\\".  The rest of this CD (along with the regular CD version of \\"Legend:Bob Marley & Wailers\\"), is the best way for 1st time listeners of Bob Marley, to love his music as the rest of us who already know what a genius this man was.  A great CD at a great price.  A MUST FOR ANY COLLECTION!

0486283577|4.0|59 Authentic Turn-of-the-Century Fashion Patterns contains 5 patterns from 1890, 8 from \\"1890-91,\\" 10 from 1891, 15 from 1893, 6 from 1894, 6 from 1895, and 8 from 1896, or a total of 58 by my count. Despite the title, this book contains no patterns from after 1896. Most of the pattern diagrams are accompanied by engravings of the garments, which show the styles to be middle-class, reasonably current, but not ostentatious. The patterns are meant to be enlarged to the wearer's size with apportioning scales, which are not included (although they were published in two other books of patterns, Bustle Fashions 1885-1887 and Directoire Revival Fashions 1888-1889). You can also enlarge the diagrams with a grid, but since they were not drawn to true scale, you need to adjust gridded patterns significantly to make them fit. The sewing instructions are scanty and for that reason, this book is most useful to people who are already experienced in Victorian dressmaking. Contemporary fashion magazines can give you ideas for fabrics and trimmings. With the aid of those other resources, you can use this book to create many different garments from the first half of the 1890s.
B0045L0D4I|5.0|Every song on this CD is awesome! It is great to find a CD that I enjoy as much as my kids and I love that we can all sing together. I highly recommend the CD!
0486407217|4.0|Authentic Victorian Fashion Patterns contains 7 patterns from 1890, 5 from \\"1890-91,\\" 3 from 1891, 14 from 1893, 7 from 1894, 9 from 1895, and 5 from 1896, or a total of 50. Despite its title, this book contains no patterns from before 1890 or after 1896. Four of the patterns are for misses or young misses, and the rest are for women. Almost all the patterns are for day dresses, although there are a few for lingerie and two for evening dresses. No pattern is included for the riding habit shown on the book cover. Most of the pattern diagrams are accompanied by engravings of the garments, which show the styles to be middle-class, reasonably current, but not ostentatious.     The patterns are meant to be enlarged to the wearer's size with apportioning scales. The original instructions for using the scales are included, but the scales are not (although they have been published in two other pattern books, Bustle Fashions 1885-1887 and Directoire Revival Fashions 1888-1889). The introduction says you can enlarge the diagrams with a grid. But in my experience, because the diagrams were not drawn to true scale, after enlargement you must adjust gridded patterns significantly to make them work. Using apportioning scales produces a much better fit. Most patterns include only a few sentences of sewing instructions, if any. Therefore, this book is most useful to people who are already experienced in Victorian dressmaking. 1890s fashion magazines can give you ample ideas for fabrics and trimmings. With the aid of those other resources, you can use this book to create many different women's day outfits from the first half of the 1890s.

B003Y5H4SY|3.0|This film was good no doubt the story line was very interesting but after a while you get the feeling like your almost stuck in the elevator with them. I personally thing anyone could have made this film with a decent HD camera and a few props like scalera black contact lenses a few badges and uniforms a room and an elevator with some security cameras and an intercom. This film yells low budget in every way but yet they want a mint for it at walmart it will set you back 19.95 plus tax I do ask that you do not pay this much for a film that could be practically be made at home. 9.95 is a more fair price for this release in blu-ray format 5.95 in DVD and that is brand new condition. I will say however I own it and like it and would buy it if I had to do it all over again but I would not pay as much for it.

B002ZG98CS|4.0|This movie was a bang up cast and a good film, and is about time Danny Trejo had a lead role in a film that was more centered on him after all of is shared and short appearances in films as the \\"bad guy\\" he does a great job at being the ruthless good doer! The film style is similar to many movies out there in the last couple of years like death proof, sin city and the like but it does not have the same film effects while it maintains a normal feel and look the storyline and acting is similar to this style. Worth watching yes but don't spend too much money on this film unless you are like me and want to support Danny Trejo in his great effort as playing hero and want to see him in more leading good guy like roles I would wait until you can pick this film up below the 29.95 price tag that I payed.
B002ZG980U|1.0|I happen to be a fan of thrillers, horror, drama movies.  I like action and a twisted story line.  Inception is just so insanely ridiculous and the story is just stretched out too far.  I went to see it with high expectations, because of the reviews I'd read and heard from others.  I was extremely disappointed and quite honestly, the movie just went on too long.  Seeing it once was more than enough for me.  There are much better movies out there than this one.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|I am so happy with this purchase.  The price was excellent for the product I purchased.  It was a Blu-ray, DVD and Digital copy all in one, with a price you can not find in stores.  Well worth it!

1594202842|5.0|The debate that Amy Chua has sparked on parenting shows what an important book this is.  It's a brilliant work - it's about culture, it's about generations, and it's about the narrative of one's own family.  But it's also brilliantly funny.  At times witty, at times sarcastic, and at all points self-reflective, this is very funny stuff.  So read it, and laugh - and, along the way, think about what it means to be a good parent and a good child.  And don't just accept what other people might say about Amy Chua - read the book and figure out for yourself why people at Yale Law School love her warmth and sociability, as well as her wit and humor.
1926778103|2.0|This a very detailed artbook, almost everything is detailed in this book. You can see characters, scenes, levels, assets and icons form the early stage until the final. Unfortunately, the binding is terrible as some have already said so it puts all the work sadly in a lower level than it could be. I am still trying to figure out why they did this with it.
B00006J3WH|5.0|I HATE musicals.... HATE THEM!!!    And this was written by Joss Whedon, who is not a songwriter.   And sung by the cast, who are not professional singers.   All this sounds like it should be a disaster...     But this episode is simply amazing.  It is one of the greatest TV episodes ever.  The lyrics are so beautiful, and actually forward the season and the series.  EVERYTHING about this episode works.  But would the soundtrack work for someone like me, who likes punk (Lagwagon, Strung Out) and metal (As I Lay Dying, A7)?    The answer is YES!!  The soundtrack reminds me of this wonderful episode, and one of the greatest TV series of all time.  I find myself singing out loud while driving and cleaning house to this amazing music.   Virtually every song is great for a different reason.     I don't know that are ANY CD's on Amazon.com that has such great ratings.  On 2 idiots who can't appreciate this magnificent piece of work.  Joss took a huge chance, and wow, did he hit a home run with this episode and soundtrack.
0385341679|2.0|Unlike Faefever and Dreamfever, Shadowfever is a whole lot of introspection and not much action.  Let me back up and say that I have been following this series for years and almost attacked the mailman with excitement when he brought the book to me.      There were a few good chapters and some questions were answered.  But there was just so much of Mac talking to herself, pages and pages of it. I understand the need to build up the suspense but really it just got old.  Also, there was so much buildup about Mac being extraordinary and that she would end up saving them all.  Then it turns out someone else steps in at the last minute and saves the day. It was so anticlimactic.     And I felt like Karen stuck in the entire Scotsmen clan just to throw a kink in the puzzle. They did not play any major role aside from being argumentative.  There was such detailed descriptions, pages of irrelevant details. I felt the book could have been at least 100-200 pages shorter, with those irrelevant things edited out.    And the ending, the most unsatisfying of all. How could it just end like that? I think Karen is getting ahead of herself. Instead of finishing this story up well, she puts too much energy (and pages) on setting up for the next story.  Which is fine if she plans to tie up more loose ends in the following series, but I don't plan to touch anymore of her book series until the entire series is out.  Waiting this many years for an ending like this was a major let down.
B004132HZS|5.0|What can I say? I'm in love with this update of Sherlock Holmes. Different enough from Conan Doyle's stories to feel original, but with plenty of connections to the source text and setting, some subtle enough that you realize later, \\"Oh, wait! Texts are telegrams!\\" Or whatever. The writers' love of the source is obvious, even when they deviate from it. The actors are delightful. Benedict Cumberbatch's is an energetic, unpredictable Sherlock Holmes, somewhat reminiscent of Jeremy Brett's but even less proper. Martin Freeman is great as an eminently likeable but surprisingly edgy Watson. The production is overall very stylish, and the three hour-and-a-half episodes feel more like feature films.
B003Y5H4SO|5.0|I'll be honest. As soon as Devil came in theaters, I expected another fluke (\\"from the creative mind of The Last Airbender\\"? Cue in the angry fans that painted themselves blue and white for THAT opening night), since M. Nigh Shyalaman was involved, be it his direct work or not. I naturally checked reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, and of course it didn't make 'fresh,' which made it all the more easy to write off. Well several months has passed since its theatrical release, and I can say that upon viewing this movie myself, Shyalaman, or whoever wrote the script and directed, has my respect again. A lot of what made the Sixth sense and Signs good is back in this film, and in all the classic ways possible.<br /><br />The premise is simple. Five characters minding their own business check into a business building, each with their own agenda and background. On the outward appearance they all seem innocent and well-meaning, but on the inside, much much more is going on - especially since one of them is the Devil. These five individuals soon become thrust together uncomfortably in a claustrophobic room, and soon, one by one, they are killed when the lights go off. What a great, great way to make a setting, and up to a pretty wicked/twisted climax, though understandably disappointing to some.<br /><br />So, the pros.<br /><br />This movie does a lot of things right - most people assume that since it's behind Shyalaman's mind that that alone is a basis for a movie to 'suck.' This is not the case. There are many points that I feel were on the spot for making a classic good yarn. First is the plot. You can already feel a delicious story on its way upon reading its synopsis. Every moment of the way, with the body count rising, every time the lights flickered, the story keeps the viewer guessing as to who is the murderer. I found myself several times eye-balling the character i felt responsible, looking for clues that will give him/her away as to being the culprit. Thus because of clever writing, paired with great atmosphere, I found myself drawn into the few characters in this film (at most about 7 important people) and actually giving a damn to finding out what happens.<br />Next is the acting. For what I was expecting (B movie, cheesy dialogue, ham-fisted acting, etc.), it was actually really good. Though it isn't acting comparable to, say, The Pianist, it IS acting that will exceed movies that are in Shyalaman films. As stated before, I gave a damn about the characters the progression of story due to believable acting following a clever script that tied everything together very well.<br /><br />Now, the cons.<br /><br />For all that I loved about this movie, it just doesn't do certain things right at all. Devil is portrayed via commercials and trailers as being a horror/thriller. I found the thriller part to be only true. The horror elements, if you could call it that, are just plain cheesy. We have the usual (spoilers) demonic face in the camera, the extremely hammy Devil, bloody visions/flashbacks, and just some very un-scary moments that is made painfully aware to the viewers that it was meant to scare you.<br />I also feel that the director missed out on a chance to show more claustrophobia in the film. We never really get a chance to feel to a satisfying degree what the five characters are going through. Maybe if the film hadn't focused as much on characters outside the elevator. This film could have really been special - say, if it was filmed entirely inside of the elevator and we never saw anything/anyone outside and only heard the external characters voices on the loudspeakers, as they did have in the movie. I feel that in that way, some of what the director and scriptwriter wanted the viewers to feel could have been achieved.<br />The climax. The entire film gives the viewer to believe that it is leading up to an amazing climax. And though I found the twist satisfying, I can fully understand people who expecting more. I mean, the movie is featuring the Devil himself, right? Sadly this part of the movie, arguably the most important, reveals the Devil as being less than what could have been.<br />And because of the nature of this movie, due to the tricks it plays on the viewer, it becomes some what of a one trick pony. Once we see how the movie plays out, that's all we ever need to see.<br /><br />The conclusion<br /><br />For what my opinion is worth, I'd say Devil is a damn good yarn that's worth your money in a rental or netflix. It really is a good movie to watch when you're in the mood for watching a movie, but just nothing in particular. It's that kind of a movie. I'd say that it's a solid movie that's much more than you would expect, especially with a movie that's been labeled \\"An M.Night Shyalaman film.\\" Enjoy this movie for what it is, light popcorn filler material and you'll find yourself a gripping thriller that you were glad to have seen.adly this part of the movie, arguably the most important, reveals the Devil as being less than what could have been.

B000W93CXQ|5.0|Ok, this is my first review of a book on here. I am not a professional critic, writer or blogger. But this book got me from the beginnig and wouldn't let up untill the end. Very sad and really, depressing. But that being said, there are a lot of kids out there who feel the way themain character did in this book. We were all there as youngsters once. Feeling helpless and loneley and to the point where you can't see the light at the end of the tunnel. This book just shows the other side of the fence from you and I with ease. My 15 year old daughter and all her friends read this and recommended it to me and i pass on the recommendation to you. Happy reading!
B0043RSE2M|4.0|Having just installed a new 3D TV I have been on a random buying spree trying to acquire 3D movies. This one had received some good reviews so I decided to add it to my collection as a 3D demo disc.<br /><br />Well it turned out the movie has not only some good 3D moments, but is also fun to watch even though I'm way past childhood. The movie is whimsical, light-hearted and full of fun; a good family movie. We'll be watching it again soon!<br /><br />It was interesting to note that some of the best 3D effects occur as the final credits roll so be sure and keep your glasses on and watch the final credits.<br /><br />I can recommend this movie for both the movie and the 3D effects.
B000MD9UJC|3.0|- Bottom Line -  I wanted this conversion kit to a) get a tail cap switch for one-handed operation and b) a brighter light than the old Maglite light bulb.  It works acceptably, but you may want to put the money into a new LED flashlight because it does neither tail cap switch or LED brightness very well.    ---  - Specific points -  Regarding the lumens (aka brightness) here are my thoughts.  One disclaimer, I don't own an expensive meter or test equipment to measure lumen output, so I am doing this by \\"eye\\" against a standard background.  a) The LED is noticeably brighter than the old standard Maglite incandescent light bulb.  b) However, it is not as bright as a new Maglite LED 2xAA version.  From what I could find, if you want a tail cap switch for the Maglite 2xAA, you have two choices.    a) This page you're looking at (the LUC2) or   b) This other product (NIQ2) <Amazon link: [[ASIN:B003MP9P9W Nite Ize NIQ2-07-1WC Upgrade II, Second Generation 1 Watt L.E.D. and I.Q. Switch, Upgrades AA Mini Mag-Lite from Incandescent to LED Technology with On/Off/Strobe Switch]]>  The LUC2:  - This LUC2 product's tail cap switch is kind of cheesy.  The cap has no rubber seal to avoid liquid or dirt.  It also \\"feels\\" kind of loose.  I have used other flashlights and their tail cap switches seem more solid.  - The tail cap doesn't have a lanyard hole.  A lanyard can be handy in my opinion.  - Does provide \\"momentary on\\".  That is: press switch slightly and the light comes on, but release and it goes off. You don't have to press entirely to turn it on and entirely to turn it off. There are times when I want to turn it on and off quickly and I didn't want the switch to be a hindrance.  I like this switch for this feature.  - This switch can be accidentally switched \\"on\\" quite easily.  The NIQ2:  My dad has this one, and the tail cap slowly blinks dim red continuously when it is electrically connected so you can find it in the dark.  Great if you want this, not so great if you don't want constant blinking.  To stop the red blinking, you could turn off the electrical connection by twisting the Maglite's focus adjustment, but then you can't turn the light on one-handed with the tail cap switch.  This kind of defeats the whole one-handed option.  Finally, here are two other (bright) flashlight options with an LED and a tail cap switch.

B003EY7IRC|2.0|I know that I'm in the minority here based on the other reviews, but I own all of KMM's other books and was waiting with bated breath for this release. So many questions left to be answered, so much of the story left to be told in this last installment, and yet I found that I could barely finish the book. It was filled with exhaustive theorizing on Mac's part and was just completely mind numbing. I found that none of the questions were answered as decisively or fully as they should have been (given that we've waited 3 books to find out), and I even thought the characters drifted a little. This was a huge let down for me.
B001UV4XFG|4.0|Eclipse was good but not as strong a story as Twilight or New Moon.  Major characters from the first 2 films were not seen much in this film. I especially missed the Cullens and Volturi.
0385341679|4.0|In case you were wondering whether you need to go back and reread all the four of the previous Fever books before reading Shadowfever, the answer is no. First, even though there are some really big surprises here, Moning didn't really leave clues in previous books that would have helped to figure out any of it and second, even having started the series five years ago, there is enough of a recap of anything of significance that even anyone as memory challenged as me will be brought right back up to speed.<br /><br />This is a humongous book, weighing in a hefty 594 pages, and before I start with what I loved and what I didn't here's the bottom line: when everything is said and done, Moning does bring her series to an epic conclusion and Mac finally grows up and gets her happily ever after.<br /><br />Shadowfever puts MAC through the full gamut of emotions and it is really an emotional rollercoaster of despair and happiness and more despair, of coming to terms with grief, and facing truths she's hidden from herself her whole life, all while fighting a battle in which her allies are just as likely to kill her as her enemies.  That said here come my nits - as much as I appreciate who Mac finally becomes, there are places in the story where she regresses to the old Mac - who was not always the smartest of heroines - and there were times when I wished that the new and improved Mac would be savvier and a bit less introspective - she covers a lot of old ground in her musings.  Another nit was that some of the biggest baddies of the story were dealt with just too easily - one, in a manner that elicited a `WTH?'<br /><br />But the last third of the book was everything I could have hoped for and then some, and much of it I never saw coming. The overall result more than eclipses any little nits I had.  If you at all liked this series, you will not want to miss this one.  Yes, there are few questions left unanswered - but if we'd been told, Barron's brethren would `have had to' have killed us - and Moning left a few characters positioned for further stories - I am not sure I want to read more Dani - and I admit I've become a bit cliffhanger phobic - but I am SO reading Christian's book when it comes out - so there's no doubt that we will be seeing more of this world even though Mac's story is through.have killed us - and Moning left a few characters positioned for further stories - I am not sure I want to read more Dani - and I admit I've become a bit cliffhanger phobic - but I am SO reading Christian's book when it comes out - so there's no doubt that we will be seeing more of this world even though Mac's story is through.
0393338959|5.0|This book is the best book on the recent economic crisis to date. Stieglitz has a strong command over the complex issues leading to the collapse. In particular, Stieglitz explains the flaws of the bailout, why it was flawed, and how a bailout could have served the interest of the public much better than it did. The best part of this book is that Stieglitz offers not only scathing critiques of recent policies, but he also offers realistic long-term solutions.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Loved it, glad I didn't have to wait to move to third book. Unlike first book, there really isn't an end to the story - instantly moves to end the trilogy
B003TEO3EI|4.0|I had high expectations from all the 5 star reviews of this disc.  This is my first BG disc.  I am familiar with Hansi because I have both Demons and Wizards discs with Iced Earth's Jon Schaeffer.  So far, I like those better than this.  Hansi's voice has aged somewhat since the last D&W disc and he sounds like WASP's Blackie Lawless at times.  Warranted.  He's still good, but a 5 star rating for this album seems a bit inflated. Guitars are what I'd expect and nothing more. Maybe it will grow on me in time...
B003UYV08E|1.0|After ten minutes into Ironman 2 I developed a splitting headache. Really. This movie is horrible....unless it was meant as parody. The scene editting(mind numbing split second shots)must have been done by some unemployed MTV gamer. Impossible to follow fast paced conversation, especially with Stark. As other reviewers complained, the advesarial quick-jab script really left these actors looking pathetic. And when is the public going to tire of computerized special effect crap? Sooooo overdone. Almost every character was some self-absorbed ego maniac. Narcissistic Hollywood enjoys creating high-society synthetic crappy art which reflects itself. Sooooooo boring. I truly hope this movie does not take up space on video store shelves in the sci-fi section. What a shameful expression of Marvel comics....and of sci-fi genre.
142314189X|5.0|This was a gift for my 13 yr old grandson.  He loves the authors style and has read most of<br />his books.  He was delighted to get the set to keep in his collection.  It was a good buy<br />at a good price from Amazon and made an excellent gift.<br /><br />grandma
B00129H7VS|5.0|I have had the standard DVD version for quite a few years.  Decided to purchase the Blu-ray.   Not disappointed.   If you have not seen this absolutely excellent mini series, it is a must.  The acting is outstanding, and you feel the pain, the hope and the fear of these brave men that gave us the freedom we enjoy today.
B000B8657S|5.0|The unanimous complaints and regrets that have been stirred up due to the lack of liner notes - in the case of Graham Johnson's CDs, an absolute delight - are very wellfounded. Recently (not sure when), Hyperion Records did something that I was hoping that they would do for a long time: they have begun to upload all of their liner notes, making them available for download. Many of their records that have been out of print for a while and only available through their \\"Archive Service\\" have received this treatment as well - and this includes all of the individual Schubert CD volumes!    Needless to say, I'm enjoying my box set immensely, much more so than if the only reference I had was the relatively cumbersome \\"Complete Song Texts.\\" I imagine it will take me the better part of a year to get through all of them.    As of this writing (January 2011), most of the 37 liner note booklets are available for download in their entirety. My rating of 5 is entirely contingent on Hyperion maintaining this service to anyone who has access to the Internet. Readers beware, record companies do have a profit motive, however - if it becomes obvious that making liner notes available for download hurt profits, I wouldn't be surprised if they removed them.
B0040JHWKS|5.0|This release contains twenty one songs first recorded over 30 years ago in the sessions that ultimately yielded Darkness on the Edge of Town.  I was blown away listening to this.  The expectation that a good proportion of the album would be filler was totally confounded.  These are gems, right up there with the tracks on Born to Run and The River.  In mood and style, these tracks are most similar to the pop tracks on The River.  Almost everything I love about Springsteen is here -- soaring melodies, lyrics sketching bleak realities, doomed love, broken dreams and defiant hope.  A few songs - Racing in the Street, Candy's Room, Fire, Because the Night -- are familiar because of Springsteen's own recordings of different versions or because of covers by other artists.  Some songs here -- Someday (We'll Be Together), One Way Street, Spanish Eyes, The Promise -- jump into my short list of favorite Springsteen tracks.  Some others miss out on that distinction only because they have been recorded in different arrangements on earlier releases -- Racing in The Street, Candy's Boy, Come On (Let's Go Tonight).      To paraphrase Steve Jobs, this is an insanely great album.  If you like Springsteen, you need to own all of these tracks.  If you are curious about Springsteen, this album is actually not a bad place to start.
B0024RIMBG|5.0|Sincerely this concert is magical.  I love, I was thrilled with her performance with the violin.  Celtic Women is for a special occasion, accompanied by a glass of wine.  The harp, accordion, flute, violins, and bass. Everything is epic.
0547338023|2.0|I had high hopes that, somehow, \\"The Little Prince\\" would be slightly less annoying in a graphic novel format.  I read it myself before I passed it to the kids.  One child picked at it a little bit, but the story is so mopey and ... well, French.  Good messages about vanity and ownership in there, but where some people are moved by a tale of self-sacrificing love, I got only fatalistic acceptance of death in the desert.<br /><br />I should have known better.  Put this one in the same category as Shel Silverstein's \\"The Giving Tree\\" - skip it.
B003UESJF6|5.0|So usually when I watch an animated film, I catch the little jokes that the writers put in there that are of a slightly sexual nature. Watching Megamind, I found none of those. I loved this movie and I'm 21!! I feel like I can play this movie around the children of my family without worrying that they're going to pick up something bad that their parents will then blame me for. I will admit, there are jokes that go over children's heads, but those jokes are intellectual like the mispronunciation of words, not sex-related puns. Overall, I think everyone with young kids would enjoy adding this movie to their collection. To those complaining about similarities in the plot to the Incredibles, I didn't find any parallels, but even if there were similarities, I bet you didn't catch the parody of Iron Man towards the end of the movie. Most movies are repeats of others, so get over it and just enjoy the movie for what it is - a very funny movie that will appeal to all ages.
B0036EH3X4|5.0|We are presented with a story about an Island, the word and its meaning should be considered within the show's mythology; an eye land, the land of the eye, the land of perception, the eye of the mind. The series deals heavily with perception; perception and interpretation. What you get out of the series really depends on what you put into (or are prepared to put into) it. Lost poses all the questions worth asking, literally, everything regarding the universe, consciousness and time. The viewer was the unseen character who saw what the Island saw, the writers kept that thread throughout the entire show. Even if you decide, after watching, that you did not enjoy Lost you could at least investigate some of the literary references; Lord of the Flies by William Golding, Everything That Rises Must Converge by Flannery O'Connor, or Island by Aldous Huxley, to name but a few.<br /><br />Lost was an incredible journey. It was beautifully complex, the ending was symmetrical, reflective and deeply moving on so many levels (emotionally and intellectually) that you need to spend some serious time to consider its meanings. I do not want to give away too much detail but you will (perhaps) find the mirroring of Season Six and the flash sideways particulary intriguing, watch the scenes in the bamboo field and the church very closely. Lost made us think, it made us look at just how deep and complex we are despite the vacuous nature of modern life, it made us think about our perception of time and of consciousness and of our place within both.<br /><br />Many of the answers were subtle, some were handed out on a plate (some were hated when given) and some require an element of hard work (you have to earn them) and independent thinking. The show is a puzzle and needs to be pieced together but it is all there. I fear many people watched The End and after about three seconds decided it was rubbish (it was really that one scene many people objected to but the church is used as symbolism and as a platform for a moment of transcendance, a moment beyond religion(s), beyond the notions of heaven and time but it was not the first time we were shown this church in Lost...) there is a lot more going on in the flash sideways than mere purgatory. Think of the Light at the heart of the Island, \\"It is the source; life, death, rebirth.\\" - What element surrounds and ties all these together and is at the heart of the show? Watch LA X again; we are shown the detonation of the bomb twice, that is for a very specific reason(s) - there are two outcomes, both real, think about it. Lost kept the sci-fi elements all the way through the sixth season and blended them with elements faith but you really need to give it some serious thought. I saw the flash sideways as a real place, another dimension related to quantum physics and multi-reality consciousness, a mirror universe inhabited by metaphysical imprints of the characters created in the flash of the jughead detonation and that is the real beauty of the flash sideways - they are left purposely ambiguous.<br /><br />Key episodes in this Sixth and Final Season are Ab Aeterno, (one of the best in the entire series) Across The Sea,  Happily Ever After and Lighthouse. These episodes are rife with hidden and open meanings. The finale, indeed the whole series is open to interpretation but that is the whole point. Such a literary show needs to be approached on the level(s) it was written.<br /><br />Everything did indeed happen for a reason, every event led to another, so nothing is rendered 'meaningless' as many have claimed of the finale. The crash, the flashbacks - the linear timeline - the flash forwards, (there is the key to the whole show right there; 'time' and the perception and the manipulation of time) the time travel, jughead, the flash sideways, they are all related. Everything you need to know about Lost is inside the show but sometimes you have to dig deep and unearth the treasures by yourself. The main mystery of the Island was revealed in 'Ab Aeterno' and the nature of the heart of the Island within 'Across The Sea' but many people did not like or accept these answers but they were given.<br /><br />Much of the fabric of Lost is surreal and that is intentional. Certain people were looking for scientific, rational answers to mythological, irrational questions. But the writers were purposely blending reality with the surreal to create that feeling of question and mystery, so one question inevitably led to another and another and another. That is why we watched week after week, season after season, year after year, because we love mystery and they revealed enough without showing everything in glaring, forensic detail, ruining the illusion.<br /><br />Many of the 'answers' are completely open to interpretation because they are suggested rather than stated and that is the beauty of Lost, it is a very different experience for different people and therefore the experience becomes very personal. If you didn't like the show that is fine but for some of us there is nothing else like it because a rarity came upon us, (along with 'The Soprano's' and 'Six Feet Under') a tv series that lifted us out of the everyday and the banal and deep into the inner (eye) realm of imagination and enabled us to make the show what we wanted. To give it our own meaning.<br /><br />I still think the flash sideways 'ending' is a new parallel dimension (not purgatory) created in the white flash, a real place for consciousness and memory to merge from one timeline into another. Like two mirrors slowly folding in on each other. But maybe that's just me...<br /><br />Finally, the best piece of Lost is left alone, it surrounds the Island now, it glints along the ripples of the water, in creeping tendrils that float and hang upon the vines and the earth.<br /><br />Mystery.f the Island was revealed in 'Ab Aeterno' and the nature of the heart of the Island within 'Across The Sea' but many people did not like or accept these answers but they were given.<br /><br />Much of the fabric of Lost is surreal and that is intentional.

B003UESJH4|5.0|I knew very little about this film except that I wanted to see it, and I hadn't expected it to be so--well, laugh-out-loud funny. Very human, tender, and somehow true, even if there has to be a little fiction in it.    Duty's a word that sounds cold and hard. But here we see a man who absolutely did not want to be king and who had been damaged by the 'family firm,' struggling to overcome his handicap in order to do his duty. And suddenly duty is a word that means character, honor, and love; it shines.    George's older brother was a hard act to follow for a somewhat shy and awkward man--when David visited the barracks he always went behind the scenes as well as where he was expected to go, and the men loved him for it. So did the rest of Britain. Which makes King George's determination to do what he must even more heroic.    If you're looking for car crashes and edge-of-the-seat plots, this probably isn't the right movie for you. But if you want real humor and a truly engaging plotline you'll think about for a while, go for it.

B003UESJHE|5.0|Speech impediments are a horrible thing to deal with, I'd imagine. And I'd imagine they are far, far worse if you're the titular leader of 1/4 of the world. That's the situation faced by King George VI in The King's Speech.    George VI (Colin Firth), called \\"Bertie\\" through most of the film, was never meant to be king. His brother, David, was the one who was meant to be king, but no one, including his father, seemed to feel he was up to the task. Everyone seemed to have the opinion that Bertie would at least be there to advise the king and would hopefully help him to be better. This all changed when David, who came to the throne as Edward VIII, abdicated to be with the woman he loved, thus making Bertie king. This was something of a problem for young Bertie on several levels, not the least of which was the fact that he had a severe speech impediment.    That impediment is the focus of this film. We see the future king and his wife (Helena Bohnam Carter), reaching their wit's end in trying to get help to correct his problems. Out of desperation, she seeks out an Australian actor/speech therapist (Geoffrey Rush). He's a man of extraordinary methods and boldly claims that he can cure the problem. Eventually, through a mix of psychology and friendship, he's able to make very real progress.    This is one of those great English movies that uses their unique institution of royalty and uses it well. Much like The Queen, which focused on George VI's daughter, we see a fairly dysfunctional family that's lead by someone who, in theory, wields tremendous power but by law has that power severely limited. It makes for great, quiet drama and more than a little humor, particularly in what I shall refer to as \\"the Tourette's scene\\".    And speaking of that... this movie is rated R. It's got that rating because of two scenes where there's a copious amount of swearing. This is flat-out stupid. It should have been rated PG13 with a warning about the language. There is nothing, nothing at all, that makes this a film that's inappropriate for anyone above the age of ten or so, but since the MPAA is what it is, it got an R rating. Stupid.    This is one of those movies that can't really be improved, except perhaps with a somewhat longer run-time. I liked it and I would have liked to have seen more of it. It's easily the second best film of the year, and will likely earn Oscars for Firth, Rush and Carter. Really, it's just a great movie and I'm glad I went to the extra trouble of seeing it.

B004HAG40O|5.0|After the concept album Hazards of Love, this very basic hummable, singable disc is the breath of fresh air I was looking for from this wonderful group.  The country fiddle on a few of the tracks is a sheer joy, and evokes remembrances of my love affair with John Mellencamp's \\"Lonesome Jubilee\\" which was awash with the same.  Thanks for a return to something simple AND incredible!

0070511136|5.0|This is a classic sales book going back about 20 years. In that time, customers really haven't changed, people still think of Sales as a bipolar relationship whereby you're meant to be `friendly' whilst taking advantage of the customer. Whether it's a product to a business (eg. HP high-end servers) or to a consumer (eg. Kobe's latest basketball shoes), or it's actually a service (like a travel agent, or an airline), the mindset should be the same: offer tremendous value, and make sure the price comes well below that value.<br /><br />Okay, before I get too deep in the marketing speak. Here Value is `all the ways you can make the customers life easier/better by using your product.' This is awesome if you can put a dollar value amount on it.<br /><br />So that's it, and the salesman's job is to rattle off enough features that turn into (in the customer's mind) `value', right? Nope. Actually the popular approach of just listing features (or reading them to the customer!) doesn't really work. It's like you're speaking Swedish, and you're expecting your prospect to be able to do the translation himself. He doesn't want to, he wants to talk to someone who will do the translation for him--either you or.. one of your competitors.<br /><br />It turns out that features are only really interesting on very simple, low-end products. Cheap products or commodities rely on features to differentiate themselves (or, shall we say, de-commoditize themselves?). Do you want the red pen or the blue one? Should it be re-fillable? Does it have a comfortable rubberized grip? Ok. Done. These are decisions that you can make in a few seconds, and don't need to consult anyone over.<br /><br />But if you have any success at all in sales, you'll want to move on to bigger and better products, where the commissions are nice and fat. If you bring that `feature' based approach with you, you won't last. All `listing features' does is increase your customer's expectation of a higher and higher price, getting you away from the value-based approach. Turn the attention to the customer.<br /><br />Rackham breaks down the research and the new method of Spin selling. Yes, you have to do a little research before sitting down with each customer, but it's worth it. Link the questions to value, get the customer to think about what might go wrong, and how much the solution is worth to them. Sales skills are important in every job. Persuasion is important to everybody. Value is important to everybody. This isn't really about money, it's about listening to people. Your task, whether you're selling a car, or persuading your friends to go to a particular nightclub is not to shoot down alternatives (competition, other nightclubs) but to ask the questions that will elicit values. You get people to declare their needs clearly, and then offer them the solution (eg. your product).<br /><br />This isn't about tricking people into buying bad products. This isn't a fight, and it's not something to be nervous about. It's not about hypnosis, and it's something you should be ashamed of. Your job is not even about money, it's about communication. What you really want to do is analyse the customers situation and find multiple ways your product can benefit them. After having done that, hopefully the value is much higher than the ticket price. If it is, you shouldn't have trouble closing the sale.<br /><br />Not only do you sell the product, you sell yourself in this way when you're looking for a raise, or applying for a new job.

B0017SWPXY|1.0|This book is pathetic. I would give it 0 stars, but that rating is unavailable.  Insulting to pass this off as a literature of any kind.
B002WTC8RA|5.0|I actually purchased this twice: once for my Kindle, and once for my daughter in law in hardback for Christmas. I am always looking for a truly great book. As I read this story of the occupation of Europe during World War II, I marveled at how creative the author was in telling the story with letters, weaving in famous historical facts as well as personal anecdotes. The character development was just amazing. I would read this book again. It was that good. After reading a book like this, I want to go find another one that is as well written.

B000PMG16U|1.0|The \\"prequel trilogy\\" are probably the most disappointing films of all time.  No amount of spit or polish (aka 1080p, re-mastering, up-res-ing, etc.) can make these films even slightly good.  Each film has a nonsensical plot, horrible dialog, lazy cinematography (most soap operas are better than this), and even the bad special effects, which were clearly the only thing that Lucas cared about.   It often seems like a 5 year old wrote these films.  The CGI doesn't hold up, and looks extremely synthetic, especially Ep. 1.   In all, each of these films are an unmitigated disasters.     I've bought the DVD's, and I have to say I'm completely done with these terrible and unwatchable films.   These are actually films that get worse the more you view them, as the plot holes become more and more glaring.  At the very least, Lucas decided to sell the originals separately, which is about the only thing this box set is good for.
B001VNB54A|5.0|I'd highly recommend watching the entire series of The Pacific before judging it. The first 2 episodes introduce some characters and have alot of action, episodes 3-5 are character development, episode 6 is insanely intense and graphic, while 7-10 continue the combat and eventually wrap up the story. i found this to be just as good if not better than Band of Brothers because of the sheer intensity of the battle scenes and I actually cared about the characters, in particular Leckie and Sledge were great leading characters!! The battle scenes are heart pounding and realistic but even more graphic than Band of Brothers or Saving Private Ryan. overall, i was glued to my couch and watched all 10 episodes straight through in one sitting!!    as for the bluray set, the extras were barebones and pretty lacking. i was honestly disappointed in that.. but the series itself is class and the audio/video presentation is top notch.
B004HUAYMS|5.0|Having been a fan since the very early days I have seen Social Distortion mature with each record into one of the best rock n' roll bands there are. Mike Ness has worked tirelessly through personel changes to keep the sound in tact and their fans appreciating them year after year. I had a feeling we would see a certain level of maturity with this new CD and I think it's great for the band. It has a great mix of music that I think will be a new avenue on which Mike Ness will cruise for a while. If I want a sharper edge to my Social D then I have several great records to listen to. I'm actually hoping that with the addition of David Hidalgo Jr. to the band some of that great Los Lobos influence might eventually creep onto a future Social D CD. Every track has its place and it all works great with each listen. Live not many bands create the atmosphere that this one does and if you look in the dictionary under \\"cool\\" there you'll see a picture of Mike Ness. My next wish would be his face on the cover of an issue of Rolling Stone instead of some top-forty bimbo or friggin' teenage vampires. I love the attention this band is getting as of late bacause no one deserves it more...I meant to add this note on my original review. In the short few days this CD has been out I have had three friends ask if they could borrow it and copy it. I said no to all three. Some time ago I decided to stop allowing people to copy my CD's. It is an insult to such great bands as Social Distortion to buy a CD and then allow people to copy it. You would not like it if the proverbial shoe was on the other foot. It is wrong and it is illegal...
0761158820|5.0|I bought this for myself.  I'm not a kid, but an adult who loves making things, whether is out of yarn or electronics.  The book has superb illustrations, great instructions and very little needed to get started.  After I used glue sticks/messy white glue for my first monster, I switched to ZOTS, which are clear adhesive dots sold at craft stores.  The glue takes longer and leaves crusty marks.  I've got the paper toy monsters in my studio, hanging around for inspiration.
B0045NXMJE|4.0|I have been a fan of the films of Jean-Pierre Jeunet since I first saw \\"Delicatessen\\" and \\"City of Lost Children\\" years ago. I confess I fail to understand what his detractors find to hold against his work. \\"Micmacs\\" did little business in American theaters. It played so briefly in my town that I missed it entirely and had to wait for the DVD release to see it at all. I rented it, and was delighted with its wacky inventiveness, and the great detail work which I associate with Jeunet.  I bought it at once.
B003PIUC02|3.0|Two and a half stars.  This series is quite unusual in the sense that men (and not women) are portrait as object of sexual desire.  Thus, throughout this show, men tend to have far less clothing and they are involved in far more erotic situations than their female counterparts.  As a straight man, I find this approach rather odd and not entirely satisfying.  (Watching this show, it seems to me that the sexual tension among males is far stronger and pervasive than those depicted between heterosexual lovers.)   Still, female viewers or otherwise, that is to say, people who really enjoy viewing the male anatomy in all its explicit glory (next to nothing is left to the imagination!) will enjoy this series more than I.  This show, to a large extend, relies on the mild pornography it delivers.  The manner this series was filmed is highly reminiscent of the movie \\"300,\\" which, let's us recall, portraits buffed, nearly naked Spartans fighting Persians.  Like that movie, this show heavily uses computer animation to reenact countless fights among lightly clothed actors --to the point some viewers might feel they are watching graphics from a computer game.   Nature (particularly the large size of the moon, the strange shapes of the clouds, the rare colors of the dawns and sunsets, the eerie winds, and so forth) looks out-of-this-world.   The same goes for the gladiators' stamina:  most characters display supernatural strength and resilience.  Lastly, the gladiators' fights, gory as they are, do not obey the laws of physics.   Once again, some viewers might be put off by the lack of realism.     The show loosely follows the life of a Thracian warrior, chiefly known by his Roman name, Spartacus.  This man was betrayed by the Romans during the last decades of the Roman Republic and was forced to become a gladiator, who, in due course, forged his fame and legend first in the arena and, later in his life, as a formidable rebel leader.  Nevertheless, historical accuracy throughout the show is kept to a bare minimum.  With the exception of Spartacus, who was an historical figure, the rest of the characters are entirely fictional.  The dialogue is crude and vulgar; most characters, including Spartacus, are depicted in almost cartoonish and two dimensional manner.  Thus, if you are looking for character depth, high drama or a complex plot, you should look elsewhere.  This is definitively not the kind of show.  On the other hand, if you are into computer-animated fights, you like blood and gore, and you enjoy (or are willing to put up with) lots of buffed actors flaunting their oiled chests, butts, and groins, then you should like this show.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I have read all of Nicholas Sparks books and have loved every one.  This one is no exception.  I look forward to seeing this as a movie.
B003PIUBZS|3.0|I found this series morbidly fascinating, visually striking, and alternately, attractive and repulsive.  I didn't think there was need for all the gorey violence and explicit sexuality. The script was intelligent in parts, and at times, almost Shakesperean, though not nearly so fluent and eloquent.  Historically, there is very little we know about the person of Spartacus except that he was a gladiator/slave and led an armed rebellion against the Roman Republic that was ultimately suppressed by Marcus Licinius Crassus, a wealthy Roman senator. How much of what we see in this made-for-TV spectacle is historically accurate is anybody's guess. If the viewer is interested in vicarious immersion in a fantastical and surrealistic version of gladiatorial combat, this series may be of interest, for it contains no shortage of gushing blood, slow-motion gore, and purposeless violence except for the benefit of the brutal beast that lies dormant somewhere in the limbic brain of all us humans. If you're interested in history, watch the movie Spartacus with Kirk Douglas, Lawrence Olivier, and Tony Curtis, which has much less graphic violence but is more historically plausible, though littered with inaccuracies as well.
B003V1WTMM|1.0|As other reviewers have said, I too enjoyed Kate Morton's previous books.  This book, however, held nothing of the lovely story-telling of her previous books.  The entire theme and smaller stories told within this book are much darker than her previous works.  This alone does not make for a bad story, but the chapters dragged dully on and on with almost entirely predictable plot outcomes and outright depressing and uninteresting characters.  We know Kate has it in her to entertain us with wonderful story-telling; I hope she is able to return to the depth, beauty and intrigue established through her first two books in the future.
B000002KOO|4.0|this is a good to great cd. this was fleetwood mac before stevie and lindsey. this was the peter green era. and it shows in the sound. the jewel on this cd is oh well. it is almost ten min. long. and it is great. the first part is rock and the second part is all acoustic guitar and is beautiful music. rattlesnake shake is a good rock song. this era of fleetwood was a totally different sound than the stevie nicks era. more blues than anything else. and heavy on instrumentation. but it is rock on some parts and true peter green genious on the other parts.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great book of love, trust and respect of two people finding themselves and each other. Looking forward to another great love story by Nicholas Sparks.
0321543726|5.0|This book is a very comprehensive text for learning C++. Included are numerous practice problems which is one feature that sets this book apart from other C++ texts. It is written so that a beginning programmer could follow, but some programming background is helpful. This book is the best I have seen on the subject.
B000001EG6|4.0|The Elton John CD I purchased was as advertised.  Great to hear it again, as I hadn't heard it since my sister had it in vinyl.
B00002N9ER|5.0|I had these installed on the dash of my old SUV - stupid me! Forgot to take them off when I sold the car!  When you drive at night, especially in snowy, blizzard conditions, you don't want to be fumbling for your 4d MagLite when something happens! My Mag Flashlight has come in handy so many times I recommend everyone to have one within hands reach \\"just in case\\". For this price, you can't go wrong!! Seen it some stores for almost 4x this price!!
B001CISHU4|5.0|I just recently started listening to Amon Amarth, and Twilight of the Thunder God is an AMAZING album. I crank it up in my mp3 player while I work and it's awesome in so many ways. The way the have the heavy death metal sound while having a melody and interesting stories in the songs.
0439023491|5.0|Publisher: Scholastic, Inc.<br />Purchased: Bought on Amazon<br /><br />What I Loved:  This book to me was even more engaging than the first one.  I thought the characters, storyline, and \\"oh my gosh\\" moments were done in the most mesmerizing way.  I loved all of the new characters that were introduced and the way that most of them tied together.  I thought Kat, Peeta, and Gale each grew more into their characters and Suzanne did a wonderful job of displaying that growth to the readers.  Kat, especially, learned what she is made of and what she stands for.  She has a line in the book where she notes that she is beginning to know herself and I think that was a very important moment in her journey.<br /><br />What I Liked: I liked that we got to see some resolution of the things from the first book and at the same time, each resolution brought a new development.  Taking the book back to the capitol was a natural and well thought out plot move.  I think it had to be there and it worked really well!<br /><br />Complaints: I really did not like the last chapter of the book.  I did not knock the rating down because of it but it really changed the whole tone of the book for me.  I am a bit apprehensive about reading the next one now.<br /><br />Why I gave it a 5: I gave this book a 5 because despite my feelings on the way the book ended--it was well written, well presented, and I had to see what happened (even if I wasn't going to like it)!  That to me was worth a 5 rating.<br /><br />Who I would recommend it too: This is a YA book though with the subject matter I would probably say older YA.  I could see this also appealing to the Sci-fi community as it has a combo Running Man/Lord of the Flies type of feel to it.<br /><br />Author Website: [...]
0060765798|5.0|Still one of the darkest and best books of the series, this multivoice/sound effect recording was definitely the way to go for entertainment value! Too bad none of the other 12 audio-books in the series offered this option. I stuck it out to the end for all the audio books and mostly enjoyed them. I would've liked my Lemony Snickets a little meaner and darker but brooding adults probably weren't the target audience LOL! The best part of all the audio books is that each has it's own music track performed by The Gothic Archies, I purchased the additional Series of Unfortunate Events audio CD and can't rave enough about it!
B0044XV3QY|5.0|I love the beginning on the extended edition. It makes the story make a little more sense. The movie looks great and I love the story!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I know Darth Vader's NOOOOO in Episode VI is wierd. But it's no too bad. I mean, at least I like the first NO. But why do you complain now??? Lucasfilm released the Classic Trilogy without any changes on DVD, after the 2004 pack. So, they will probably do the same thing now on Blu-Ray. I like the Prequels, I love the Classic Trilogy. And I believe it'll be great to watch the entire saga upgrated together as one movie.
B003CFBQBW|5.0|Just way to much rock.  Need to get to the classical music and you have to wade through this dvd to find any. Just like the previous two music cd's to these movies.
0061245097|4.0|Publisher: Avon<br />Purchased: Bought on Amazon<br /><br />What I Loved: Bones! I am also starting to warm up to Cat :)  This was even better than the first book.  I laughed more, blushed more, and rooted through the fights more.  This story was good from beginning to end and not a part of it disappointed.  Bones was even more Bones and yes this was the book with the infamous Chapter 32 (I think I blushed while reading).  My favorite part of the book was the wedding that happened near the beginning--I will leave at that because I don't want to give anything away. Fav character of this book: Rodney the Ghoul because well he really stepped up!<br /><br />What I Liked: The Team!  Juan was hilarious.  Cooper came around brilliantly.  Dave was just awesome, especially how adaptable he was (just read the end to know what I mean).  Tate, I think is a good foil to Bones because he is really a good guy.  Heck, even Don grew on me.  My boy Spade wasn't in the book long enough but that is ok, his part was really good :)<br /><br />Complaints:<br /><br />Why I gave it a 4:  Actually more like a 4.5 but since I do a whole number scale I went with 4.  This was even better than the first book and a thoroughly enjoyable read!<br /><br />Who I would recommend it too: PNR readers (though I think I am the last to read it) and also UF readers because it is edgier than the typical PNR.<br /><br />Author Website: [...]
B0025VLEM0|5.0|I'm a huge fan of this film.  I've seen it numerous times, and I'm sure i'll see it plenty more. It's a really fun film with a unique twist on zombies. It isn't just a survival of a horde massacre, it's genuinely hilarious and well put together. The actors mesh very well together, and fill their roles excelently. Before picking up or watching this film, make sure you don't mind a bit of crafty, quirky british humor.
B002ZG980U|5.0|Finally, a mega-budget Hollywood blockbuster worth raving about!<br /><br />Christopher Nolan, the genius behind the last two \\"Batman\\" movies, hits new heights of creativity and imagination with \\"Inception,\\" a sci-fi masterpiece about a technology that allows people to enter into the dreams of others with the express purpose of planting ideas into their subconscious. The concept is dealt with on such a complex level that, for a large portion of the movie, the characters are floating around in a dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream. Yet, so intelligent is the writing and so meticulously thought-out the premise that the audience almost never gets confused about what's happening and, thus, can just sit back, relax and go along for the ride.<br /><br />And what a ride it turns out to be! Without getting too deep into the nuts-and-bolts aspects of the plotting itself, suffice it to say that the story involves a group of \\"dream manipulation experts\\" - Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Ellen Page, among others - who employ the technology known as Inception to enter into the pre-programmed dream of a young man (Cilliam Murphy) whose ailing father owns a giant energy firm. Their goal is to convince the son to break up the company after the old man (the late Pete Postlethwaite in one of his final performances) dies, so that a wealthy competitor (Ken Watanabe) will be able to pick up the pieces for himself. It's a tribute to Nolan's astuteness as a storyteller that he gives us this rather mundane overarching plot device rather than having the mission be about convincing someone to blow up half the civilized world or something equally over-the-top. This simpler motivation keeps the movie from sliding over into cautionary-tale territory - where most serious sci-fi works seem to eventually wind up - and allows us to concentrate more fully on the content and style of the dreams themselves.<br /><br />Another triumph for the genre is that the movie gives us a central character who's actually worth caring about. DiCaprio, the head of the team that goes into the dream, is a generally reformed \\"corporate espionage thief\\" who lost his wife (Marion Cotillard) as a result of a dream-traveling scenario gone awry and who has been wracked with grief and guilt over the incident ever since. As if that weren't bad enough, he's been forbidden to return to the United States, where his two small children reside, because the authorities mistakenly believe he was responsible for her death. It is only when Watanabe promises to get the murder charges dropped if DiCaprio does this one last job for him that he agrees to take on the mission. As embodied by DiCaprio, who, by the way, has never been better, Dom Cobb becomes the heart and soul of a movie that, given the genre's track record in that regard, could easily have had neither a heart nor a soul. Instead, Nolan and DiCaprio draw us into the picture with an emotional force rarely found in even the most intimate indie drama, let alone an effects-laden super-spectacular such as this one.<br /><br />And spectacular is certainly the word for the cornucopia of visual delights the movie offers up to its audience, as a team of FX wizards creates dream worlds of eye-popping complexity and design.<br /><br />Like even the best of films, \\"Inception\\" is not without its flaws. I could certainly have done without some of those skiing scenes near the end, and I'm sure there are enough holes in the plotline to keep perfection-seekers nitpicking and carping for years to come. However, I also imagine that \\"Inception\\" will be dissected and studied over by film students and film lovers alike in endless fashion, and that their efforts will lead to the discovery of themes, motifs, symbols etc., that are not readily apparent on a single viewing, when we're just dazzled by all the brilliance and ingenuity that's gone into the work.<br /><br />That's all the more reason for movie watchers to return to this cinematic treatregularly and often.
B000PMG16U|5.0|The Prequel Trilogy is a great adition to the Star Wars saga. Combined with the Classic Trilogy as one movie, makes Star Wars story much epic.

B003M731UE|4.0|To begin with, I have to say there is nothing I identify with with these people.  They are the definition of trash.  However, I will take trash and violence any day over CSI plasticity and commercials.  Of course, this means I only watch the uncut video.  With Netflix streaming and Amazon Video on Demand, it's the only way to go.  I have watched maybe 3 hours of broadcast since May, and that was all I could take.<br /><br />Now, back to SAMCRO.  If you take the series as vignettes into the worst side of society exaggerated enough to make it interesting, you have this series.  It is well acted and produced and the second year seems to have better continuity than the first.  It will give you all the blood and gratuitous violence you could ask for, but it is not anywhere near the top 20 or 30 of my all-time favorites.<br /><br />Breaking Bad and Dexter outclass the Sons of Anarchy by far.  The Sopranos had characters who were just as evil and sociopathic, but you still felt some train of civility in the series.  This is about Western humanity at its lowest denomenator.  These are the people no one really wants to be, and they are created to show that through all the crime and violence, they never really get ahead, or find any happiness.  You learn why civilized society, with all its flaws, is still a far better alternative to the amoral, dysfunctionally immature lives these people lead.<br /><br />I'm sure there are real-life people who are very close to these gangsters, and it is sad that any baby brought into this world could end up becoming anything resembling these creatures.  They create their own prisons, the very opposite of what they think they are fighting for, in their own lives by their own choices.  They have no freedom.  They are characatures of an ideal that can only be achieved by living your life in a completely opposite direction.<br /><br />As a press photographer, I saw a lot of this carnage and insanity, and the question I always had was why these people couldn't make the simplest positive decision in their lives.  They end up being the ultimate victims of totalitarian control.  They are trite, worthless to society, and the best argument next to fundamentalists at the opposite end of the spectrum for rounding up the polar ends of our society, sticking the bikers and gangsters in Kansas and the fundamentalists in Alabama and just building fences around them, so they can do their thing, no matter how unproductive and bizarre.<br /><br />Slight spoiler:  At the end of one episode, the central character and his mother, who had been gang-raped and beaten by thugs from organized crime, climb on top of the \\"clubhouse\\" roof to watch the sunset and share a cigarette in a totally repulsive, squalor-laden industrial area.  Just the American Dream I want for my children...NOT!  Actually, the grossest part for me was the cigarette sharing...single-wide, there you are!<br /><br />We are attracted to that which repulses us for some reason, and Sons of Anarchy is as repulsive as Palin's Alaska or Some \\"Octomom Christmas\\" special, although not as bad as a series based on a merry band of pedophiles.<br /><br />It is a sad commentary on a degenerate minority, but if the alternative is Two and a Half Men, I'll take SAMCRO every time.  It is well done and gives food for thought and imagination.

I loved it and it was the first time ordering from Amazon and it was a okay experience. I would do it again because I trust them which is a nice feeling. Thank You, and to be frank in this day and age to trust someone with my Visa card is a great feeling . I of course passed on my experience to someone whose has never done this before.
B000063DI8|3.0|This album has some good moments (Tailgunner - bring you daughter + some parts in some songs) The vocals are good but the problem is that its just average-> you just have a neutral feeling not so powerful like listening Seventh son or Powerslave...I believe that is exclusively for the Iron Maiden fans and only for them.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|The latest installment of the Fever Series does not dissapoint. From the moment I picked it up I could not put it down. I have always beem a fan of Mrs. Moning but this book is by far superior to all her other novels written this far. It is quite possibly the best book, and series, I have ever read.
0143117130|3.0|Bought from Amazon<br /><br />What I Loved:  Bridget was a wonderful mess of a woman that I think most singledoms can relate too on some level.  Mark Darcy is so straight-laced and adorable that it is hard not to fall in love with him.  Daniel is the perfect cad with just enough hotness that you don't totally hate him.  Put them all together and you have one fun mess!<br /><br />What I Liked: The family, friends, and co-workers are really the glue that keeps this book going.  They made you laugh out loud and kept our Bridget grounded at times.<br /><br />Complaints: Unless Bridges is 4'10\\", the weights translated in the US version had her being a size 6.  That isn't even pudgy.<br /><br />Why I gave it a 3: I liked the book but I am not likely to read it again.  It was fun, quick, and even though a bit annoying at times--it was what I expected.

I was on the edge of my seat with this movie, lots of action and heroism.  I think that this movie is one of the best I have ever seen.  Owen Wilson did a fantastic job in this movie and although he streamlines with mostly his character he was great in this action movie and held his own.
0439023521|5.0|Publisher: Scholastic, Inc.<br />Purchased: Bought on Amazon<br /><br />What I Loved: The story compelled me from beginning to end even in its most disturbing moments.  I wanted to know what happened even when I really wanted to just skip ahead and find out everything would be ok.  The characters were all well thought out and presented in a fashion that no matter how long or short of time they had, it felt like you knew them.  The author presented them in a fashion that you cared one way or another about what happened to them. Even the most distasteful characters you wanted them to get theirs. Both of these elements were so well done and combined that the pages flowed effortlessly till the end.<br /><br />What I Liked: It was great to learn a little bit about each district through their competitors even though you never saw their part of the world.  You slowly found out that hardly anyone outside the capital really had it easy even though it could appear that way from the outside. I also enjoyed the flashback scenes where you got to learn a little bit more about Katniss and why she is the way she is.  It really helped to flush her out as a character.<br /><br />Complaints:  Very seldom do I have any complaints about a book when I give it a 4.  This is not really a complaint but more of a why it will be a bit before I read the next one.  I love when a book has realistic tendencies but I need hope in order to feel complete at the end.  This book was downright depressing to me because there just was not hardly, if any, hope. It seemed like for every up turn, there was an even bigger down turn. At the end, I shut the book feeling like they were just fighting to stay alive but not live.  That is hard for me to fathom for anyone.  I do want to know what happens.  I just have a feeling this will be one of those series that might not fulfill in a total way for me. That isn't a bad thing just not something I read very often because I like to escape into the world I am reading.  This is not a world I would want to be in.<br /><br />Why I gave it a 4: It was really well written and told.  I would have put this book down in a lesser author's hands because it is just not the type of book I normally would read.  It did not give a 5 because I wasn't happy with the end.  That is just a personal preference though and I have read many reviews giving the book a 5.<br /><br />Who I would recommend it too: This is a YA book though with the subject matter I would probably say older YA.

0307704610|3.0|I bought the audio book for my brother.....I was unaware that starting on disc 2, the author starts discussing sex in very explicit detail.......what side of the clitoris to rub for maximum stimulation, men - use 9 short strokes and then one full deep stroke in order to maximize her experience, etc. My brother is no prude but he does pick up his grandkids in \\"Grandpa's Taxi\\"........Just be forewarned if you buy the audio version. The information in the book seems worth a try to lose some weight and get healthier. How much faster is yet to be seen. As for the sex part....it all made sense!

B004FLW2F6|5.0|Among the brilliant albums recorded by Stevie Wonder during the early-to-mid '70's period widely considered his Classic Works, Fulfillingness' First Finale stands out in its gravity. The tunes are colored in their melancholy and compared to the balance of master works during this stretch the instrumentation and arrangements are atypically restrained. This is my favorite album in the multi-award-winning \\"group of five\\" and for this reason it's the perfect album to be remastered - treated to a new coat. The record's been remastered before, but this new compact disc literally receives a solid 24 carat gold treatment by master engineer, Kevin Gray and the talented folks at Audio Fidelity.   I received the CD and immediately popped it into my car stereo system. Later in the evening it was played on my home system and finally I listened with headphones. With flying colors, the new-found fidelity ace'd each of my listening tests. Yes, I'm satisfied at first listens, but the real test came in the days preceding the writing of this greater observation, when I did comparison tests. \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" this CD to earlier digital productions (or the vinyl for that matter) and you'll begin to hear new highs, lows and mid-range sounds missing from all previous issues. This recording is alive, it will fill your room with the power of great art. I'm prejudiced, because I love the album, but I'd argue I'm also that much more critical in my judgement, my conclusions (with the CD now playing in the background and inspiring my words) that this work must be considered the standard by which to judge all other releases of Fulfillingness' First Finale.  The packaging is gorgeous and true to the original album art. Above and beyond the pure enjoyment of the sound of the recording are the hit songs included, \\"Boogie On Reggae Woman\\" and \\"You Haven't Done Nothin'.\\" There are fine contributions by guests performers including The Jackson 5 and The Persuasions and frontline background work by Minnie Riperton, Deniece Williams and, interestingly, Paul Anka.   This is stripped-down Stevie (wait until you hear \\"They Won't Go When I Go\\"), nearly minimalist accompaniment (\\"Too Shy To Say\\") and all the better to hear his rousing vocals (\\"Bird of Beauty\\"). I promise you'll never get closer to revisiting the magic of \\"Little\\" Stevie (\\"Please Don't Go\\") and experiencing the genius of Stevie Wonder as you will by listening to this remastered addition to his magnificent body of work.
1451539401|5.0|This is going to be a totally different type of review from me.  In fact, it really isn't a review at all.  It is more of an \\"ode to Jane Austen\\".  I truly do think she ruined my dating life but I totally forgive her for it :)<br /><br />First question you are going to have is why do I have a picture of Jane (played by Susannah Harker) from Pride and Prejudice on a post about Sense and Sensibility?<br /><br />  Answer:  I listened to the audiobook version of Sense and Sensibility read by her and it was possibly the best audiobook I have ever heard!  Yes better than Jim Dale reading Harry Potter (which I also really enjoyed)!  If I am going to review anything in this post that is it.  If you get a chance to pick up this audiobook version, you should.  She is very good at making each character unique and keeping you engaged the whole book.  It is unabridged so 14 hours long but well worth it.<br /><br />Disclaimer: Yes, I have read Sense and Sensibility a few different times before listening to it on audio.  It is my 2nd favorite Jane Austen novel behind Pride and Prejudice. So the story is very comforting and familiar.  I have the characters I love, the ones who annoy me, and the ones I would like to throw to the wolves.  However, as with all great books, it always leaves me with the the hope that in the end the nice guy does in fact finish with the girl of his dreams.  Austen is one of the best at taking flawed characters that come from a place of good and making them find each other.<br /><br />This book particularly appeals to me because out of all of Jane Austen's characters I am probably the most like Elinor.  I am a little more open about my opinions but otherwise she is the closest to me personality wise.  I would also like to think that out there is an E. Farris for me, as he is exactly the type of guy that I go for.  Smart, Off-Beat humor, Loyal, Kind, and good to his word. So reading their rather understated romance always warms my heart.  Plus, I love Brandon and his steadfast beautifully portrayed personality. He is the Bingley of this novel but Marianne takes awhile to realize that.<br /><br />So my rating: 5+<br />My Recommendation: Get thee to the bookstore and read it!don and his steadfast beautifully portrayed personality. He is the Bingley of this novel but Marianne takes awhile to realize that.<br /><br />So my rating: 5+<br />My Recommendation: Get thee to the bookstore and read it!
1932100660|5.0|A frind of mine, that had a heartattack and a tripple bypass surgery done, and ( finally) got seriously interested in ways to keep alive and kicking a bit longer.    He did a serious study of what is out there, and according to him, his biggest trouble was all the hype and misinformation in the nutritional field, caused by groups, companies or persons with special interest in this field, thus very much of the \\"information\\" given out by them is always heavily biased towards what is financially good for them.    The misinformation campaign by these groups is massive, and thus, even if it is obvious that ailments that plauge the western civilization much more than other civilizations, like heart desease, diabetes, cancer and obesity, it is financially good for those interest groups, and the misinformation will by these groups continue.    My friend is a succesful person that have build up a very big company in the shipping industry, and is by nature a person that goes to the bottom of things, and finally he got on the right track, got hold of this book, read it and started to live his life accordingly.    Not long after when he went to his routine check ups, the doctor was amazed of his bloodvalue. My friend is in his upper 60's but had values that of a teenager.    He had bugged me hard to read this book, and as I am always a bit critical in my nature, and have a little bit of a conservative way of looking at things.....we will see what gives...I am not an easy sell, but after my friends last visit to the doctor and the results was unrefutable, he finally sold me on the idea of buying the book.    Reading it, it opened up a whole new world for me, how the nutrition in our society is not based on what is good for us, it is almost as the food industry wants us dead. The autorities are well entrenched with special interest, and the legislative side of the nutrition chain are well protected, and also a source of misinformation.     This book is written by a person that have acted his whole life inside of this system, been to hearings, sitting in comittees and on advisory boards.    The result of the enormous ammount of research that has been done ( paid by taxpayers money) over a long and comprehensive period , often end up as a folder, with a stamp on it, in an archaive somewhere. The author of this book have himself participated in many of the research projects, ...got fed up with why the results was ignored over and over again, and compiled the results.    The book will give reference, by reference, by reference, plain numbers....that's why I said in my headline that this book is way beyond hype.     The book will tell, what proteins, minerals and vitamins different cultures are mainly eating, and show the difference in consumption of different nutritions, in direct comparison with the main ailments we have, cancer, diabetes, obesity and heart desease.    ....and it will be an eyeopener.    I strongly recommend this book.    Jolly Roger
B0002F6BRE|5.0|Who doesn't love Will Ferrell?    Even if you don't like Will Ferrell I'm willing to bet you'll love this movie - my new fave Christmas classic!!!

0756404746|5.0|As I finished the last page of this book, I looked at my husband and said, \\"I'm finished. And I don't want to be!\\" Which was unexpected, because when I picked this book up from the library, I looked at the 700+ pages, the laughable Fabio like red-headed male on the front (my library's copy does not have the cool cover featured on Goodreads), and Patrick Rothfuss' name and thought, oh hannah, what ridiculousness is this? There's no way that I'll get 50 pages into this. Oh, was I wrong.    This book is everything I ask in a book: engaging, well written, witty, low on the swearing & sex, wonderfully compelling characters, well paced, belieavble fantasy (esp when concering alchemy, something I've found boring in other books) and most important, long enough that I can sink my teeth into and not finish it in a few hours, but love every page. Kvothe was awesome, believable, flawed (but in a way that made him very real), and engaging. There wasn't once that I looked at the words on the page and thought, oh man, could this kid be anymore self assured to the point of smugness? Even though he really was at points. But Rothfuss is a master story teller and manipulator of words that as a reader, you are able to swallow Kvothe's pride and cheer him on.     The Name of the Wind is most likely the best book I've read in a while. And I'm anxious to get my hands on the next book in the trilogy come March.
B004GCJ11C|5.0|I love this book. i love kris carr! but i am really disappointed in the kindle version of this book...there are more than a handful of pages that include testimonials, the \\"diet\\" plan, lists of GI foods, the dirty doze/clean fifteen etc that I can barely read even with a magnifying glass (and believe i have tried). You can enlarge the font on every other page but these pages therefore there is no way to read the itty bitty writing...which means although i paid for the book I can't read a lot of it, including all the info on the 21 day cleanse (the heart of the book). I don't have the money to go out and buy the book again so...not sure what i can do. But regardless...i am really inspired with what I have read!!
0316098337|3.0|Bought on Audible<br /><br />What I Loved: The story was told very well from the perspective of a 5 year old boy.  The descriptions of everything from the room, to the clinic, and finally the outside world are done with wonder and innocence that only a 5 year old would have.  The pacing is just perfect for this story--you spend the right amount of time in each of the different areas of the book.  It is at times emotionally griping and sometimes you catch yourself smiling.<br /><br />What I Liked: The interactions of the adults are sporadic but they do add a layer to remind you that Ma is going through all of these changes also.  The little details are also a great addition to the book: the weather descriptions, the time of day, and little things that we take for granted.<br /><br />Complaints:  The asking for \\"can I have some\\" was a little bit much and I think a little too repetitive. I also think at times there needed to be a little bit more \\"adult\\" voice used.<br /><br />Audio Part: The narrators used for the audiobook were excellent.  I liked the fact that there were different actors for the main voices.<br /><br />Why I gave it a 3:  The book was excellently written and well acted on the audio.  The subject at times was a little to \\"over-done\\" for my taste but I do understand why I have seen reviews from 1 to 5.  This book is one that will make you have strong feelings.<br /><br />Who I would recommend this too:  To be honest, with the subject matter I am hesitant to say who this would appeal too.  It is a general fiction book with strong emotional elements, if you like those things this book is for you.<br /><br />[...]
B0031YJFCQ|2.0|I am only starting part 3 of this book, but so far I just want it to end. It's all about, \\"blah blah blah\\".... It does make sence if the author was not able to go back and edit it; however someone should have elliminated a lot of the sub-plots and extra charecters in this book. The first two of this series were amazing in my eyes. I have to finish the book, but please give me the strength to do so.
B000683VI4|5.0|A friend recommended this to us and we were not disappointed!  This is a moving story of real and selfless love--I could watch it over and over.  Don't forget to have a box of tissues handy with this flick.
0142405809|5.0|This is a wonderful simple story, with rhyme.  Both my 4 & 6 year old really enjoy it.  They also like the Gruffalo by the same author.  I would highly recommend this book for anyone's classroom or home library.
1595141979|3.0|What I loved:  I really enjoyed the ghost storyline in this book and finding out more about Anna (how she relates to Rose). The history of what has happened before and how it is correlating to events happening in the present was well written and enjoyable.  I also liked the friendship growing between Christian and Rose. The ending of the book was emotionally powerful--will only tell you to grab a hanky!<br /><br />What I liked:  I liked the whole book but it wasn't as good a read as the first two.  Then again, I think it really served it's purpose to move along the story, give you some background, and give you a glimpse into what is in store for Rose/Lissa after graduation.  I think it also grew some of the characters that were minor before but growing in importance: Adrian and Eddie.<br /><br />What was so-so:  Lissa--maybe it was because this really showed the strain that the bond has on Rose but I thought Lissa was being selfish this book.  I know Rose is her guardian but the end scene between the two made me want to scream at Lissa to quit being a spoiled little princess(up until then--I think I gave her slack due to Rose not being communicative about the bond, the stresses, and other things going on in her life).<br /><br />Why I gave it a 3.5:  This is still a very good book just not as strong as the others.  I think the series will go back to the 4 range in the next book.  I would recommend this to any YA or PNR reader (please read in order though).<br /><br />[...]
B003EY7IRC|4.0|So many loose ends tied up, but also many more that can be examined.  I can't wait.  I find myself reading the end of the book over and over.  After reading the end again I came to the conclusion that if Ryodan and the rest want to make war, or even remotely think about threating Jericho, Mac will not only open that book, she will destroy the world to protect her man.
B004DMAZQK|5.0|November 4, 2013 UPDATE: I've been thinkng of editing my review of Ritual for a long time.  It feels appropriate to do it since Big TV came out not too long ago.  I'm going to keep my mouth shut about Big TV, because I've realized that any negative feelings I have towards new material from White Lies is entirely my problem.  They are a great band and so refreshing.  I really haven't been excited by a new band like this since I was in high school in the early 90's. I love them.  I love Ritual.  No, I LOOOOOOVEEEE Ritual.  In my earlier review, I thought that maybe they were influenced by fancy producers.  Really?  So what?  Who cares if they were.  Ritual is a fabulous, listenable (over and over again) album.  I had a serious gut reaction to Ritual because I loved To Lose My Life so much.  Perhaps I don't like change?  How many singles can these guys make that sound like Death?  As artists, they're entitled to experiment and evolve.  All the songs on Ritual hit the same nerve as To Lose My Life, but in a different way.<br /><br />Old review below.  I'm such a judgemental fool.<br />Allow me to preface by saying that my all-time favorite band is Depeche Mode.  Stranded on a deserted island with only one band to listen to.  Depeche Mode.<br /><br />White Lies is a really young band.  Ritual is too much of a departure from To Lose My Life.  When Depeche Mode brought \\"real instruments\\" into their music, it was difficult to swallow, but excusable because they had taken their dark electronic sound, after working on it literally for decades, very far (they were still Depeche Mode - but different).  Was White Lies left alone to develop naturally or influenced by big time expensive producers with a \\"vision?\\"  Did they see three extremely talented kids (really, 22 year olds are quite maleable) and have dollar signs in their eyes?  I find it hard to believe that White Lies got to Ritual from To Lose My Life without major outside influences.  With that being said, I do like Ritual.  I just love To Lose My Life so much, that I'm finding Ritual too different.  It just isn't a logical next step.  What makes To Lose My Life so great is the underlying sophistication encased in a grimy outer layer.  Ritual lacks this grit.  With all that being said, I am enjoying many tracks on Ritual: Turn the Bells, Come Down - like listening to a new DM single for the first time.
B000EUDAWG|4.0|Interesting spider.  It makes a lot of noice when moving.  Looks a lot like a real tarantula except larger.
B001IAOEXU|2.0|Everyone is either raving about how good they were, or how bad they were.  I only experienced the added<br />benefit for about a minute.  Then they started to come off. Maybe others used glue or something, but<br />there are games I would not want them on for.  I never even took them off to switch games, they kept<br />coming off on their own.  I thought perhaps I just got a bad pair, so after trying them on the standard<br />Sony controller, and my others, I replaced them, only to get the same results.  If they could stay on,<br />they might offer a slight benefit.<br /><br />Final judgement, A lot of third party controllers these days have extended triggers anyway, and for those<br />that like the 360 controllers, a lot have the offset sticks. I have found this to be the better way to go.
0307272702|5.0|I read Gary's earlier book (Good Calories Bad Calories).  I've followed multiple \\"low carb diets\\"(Zone, Carb addicts diet etc.) over the years but subconsciously I've still avoided fatty food (e.g. sausage) and ate too many fruits, whole grain breads and brown rice (starches). The constant barrage in all media exhorting us to reduce our fat intake and increase our exercise is working and people are still getting fatter and ending up diabetic, obese etc.  I gained about one pound a year and found it very difficult to get rid of the spare tire.  After I read this book I was somewhat depressed realizing what he was saying is about all we know about nutrition and getting fat.  It's not about calories in/calories out.     It's about the carbohydrate-Insulin-fat storage process.    We've been brainwashed since the 70's on various versions high carb low fat/calorie restricted diets - some advocating complex carbs and \\"whole foods\\" etc.  This seems to work for a small group.  For the rest of us we're looked at as people who have let themselves go.    Read this book and overcome your cognitive dissonance.    Sometimes you have to hear the truth multiple times \\"to get it\\".

B002ZG99N6|4.0|I have always thought that Ben Affleck has gotten a bad rap, I usually enjoy him in the films he has made...there could be a few exceptions, but I could say that about a lot of other good actors too. He's not going to win a best actor award, but he is someone I want to watch in a film. The Town returns to Affleck's roots of Boston and delivers a very good crime drama with some interesting sub plots. I found this film very engrossing, but not perfect. Some more detail to the characters would have paid off greatly, but it is still an impressive piece of work from Mr. Affleck who directed, co-wrote and stars in this little tale of love and honor among thieves.
0439023513|3.0|I couldn't wait to find out if it would be Peeta or Gale in the end.  I didn't care for the journey as it played throughout book 3. However the final outcome was understood by this reader & it made sense why the author led Katniss to that particular destiny.      Ok - so now it's over & I still find myself wondering what, exactly, kept me interested in this triology.  As disturbing as the concept was, the overall tale kept me reading, fast and furious. Book 3 wasn't the best and as others mentioned, it felt rushed and strict - all the scattered pieces quickly tied in a bundle to bring a close.
B002ZG99QS|5.0|I thought the first half of the movie was perfect.  Perfect -- I couldn't have imagined it being better (for us old Tron fans).  The second half, while more original, faded a bit, but I will still see this movie over and over and over again.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|I made a New Year's resolution to read at least 1 book a month.  Room by Emma Donohue(sp) was a quick and easy read for me.  I like the narration by a 5 year old, initial setting of story, and how the story touches on the past, present and future.    I don't want to give anything away or a spoiler, but its a truly sad story.  I felt that even though it was through the 5 year old's eyes, I could feel the pain of \\"Ma\\" and what she was going through.  It wasn't full of twists, turns and surprises, but that is nice to just read a book about a mother and son going through a very tramatic experience.  Even though it was a story that you could predict what may happen, I still enjoyed what I was reading.    If I had to say a few things I disliked, it would be that the author used objects as \\"people\\".  For example, the rug was Rug.  It was as if the objects were alive.  I am not sure if that was because we had to see it from the young boy's eyes or if she likes to write that way, but it was something that just bugged me.  I also was not a big fan that she had the boy breast feeding at 5 years old.  The descriptions used and how often it would occur just grossed me out.      All in all, I am giving it 4 stars and worth reading.  Its better than average, but not a classic (in my opinion)
B002ZG994U|4.0|I was never a big fan of the TV show even though I watched it from time to time. It was a guilty pleasure at best, but it was a little too corny for my taste. This upgrade to the big screen version does what any good upgrade ought to, it makes something OK much better. I was pleasantly surprised by this film and for the most part I think the casting was exceptional.....for the most part..yeah well, I think Jessica Biel is super hot and I can look at her endlessly, but she is miscast in a pivotal role in this film. Once again Hollywood must throw some contrived love story into a film that needs it like it needs realistic action sequences.<br /><br />Jessica isn't a bad actress(and she is gorgeous!), but she just can't carry the weight of her role in this film. Fortunately there is enough going on with over the top action and comedy to spare to distract from this glaring flaw. With a more appropriate type in the role, this film might have made it to 5 stars as a great escape action/comedy film. It is certainly worth seeing and I may just pick this up when the price is right. The DVD has a slick transfer and I would imagine the Blu Ray looks fantastic!<br /><br />Some of my Ammie buddies have expressed how much they liked the TV show. I really don't mean to trash the TV series, but by 1983, I was 21 years old and had already been playing in rock bands for 6 years. The A-Team was just a little after my time. If you were a little youger, I can certainly see the shows draw. That being said, I watched the show more than I care to admit! ;-b
B000002GLV|5.0|I remember first listening to this album about 35 years ago and loving it then. I recently purchased it and have found it every bit as good as my memory. A terrific collection of musicians with the guitar play of Freddie Robinson outstanding.
B000B8QG4A|1.0|I was so excited to get the \\"Lady & the Tramp\\" DVD and watch it with my grandaughters.  Unfortunately, the tape is faulty and is not watchable.
B004G6009U|5.0|The advertisements for this film were so bland and silly that I had no interest in seeing it until I read the reviews here at Amazon. Whoever was in charge of the previews needs to go back to school. I really love this movie and I almost passed it up as a total yawn-fest. The animation was great, the graphics were beautiful and the characters so very lovable, even the 'thugs' at the pub.<br /><br />The horse is easily my favorite character for two reasons. First because he was hilarious, his facial expressions were priceless and it was just so much fun to watch his antics. Second because he reminded me alot of my other favorite animated horse from Sleeping Beauty, my all time favorite Disney movie when I was a kid.<br /><br />As for the problem with girls and their self image, I'd look at the 'evil mother' character as the example in this movie. She always looked young and beautiful and went to great lengths to stay that way, no matter the cost, but that's all she had and she was never happy. By valuing the one thing that is guaranteed *not* to last - youth and outer beauty - she ends up with nothing.
B002ZG97RY|1.0|This is not a review of the movie, but of the GAWD AWFUL quality of the video.  Some people have left reviews of scenes looking grainy. Well it's worse than \\"grainy\\".  In certain scenes, it's downright \\"snowy\\".  You know, that snow you used to get on old TVs with rabbit ears....YEAH, that bad.  If you take pride in your BluRay collection, then DON'T buy this BluRay. Rent it, Netflix it, whatever....just don't buy it!
B0039TD7PY|5.0|This CD/DVD combo is absolutely fantastic! James and Carole are, as always, great together and this is soooo smooth and laid-back. Nice music to kick back and relax with! Got exactly what I paid for and don't regret a dime I spent. I'm going to get 2 or 3 for gifts!
0385341679|5.0|I pre-ordered this book over a year ago and when it shipped it tookonly 2 days to get here and it was in awesome shape. I haven't started to read it yet but it will be good. I would recommend Amazon to anyone!!! Yall are awesome!!![[ASIN:0385341679 Shadowfever]]

0061537969|5.0|I love dogs, at least mine, and have a very high standard for dog stories. I also have a high standard for stories that generally steal my heart and remain on my bookshelves for re-reading (instead of being passed on to the library of no-return). This book took over my life while I read it, and has a permanent place in my home and heart. It was complex enough to surpass the \\"feel-good\\" genre, and made me believe my dogs and I will have a future beyond what I ever could have imagined. No spoiler alert here....if you love dogs, racing, people, karma or love, you must read this book. It will change you and give you a fantastic vision of a rich life, after-life and re-birth with those you never want to lose.
B0042RUMG4|5.0|This album is great for people who love good music. This is one of those rare albums where you want to listen to it from track to track with no shuffle. It's a must have!
B001DXS4E2|5.0|A great movie for people who love nostalgia, film making, and music.  It takes the viewer into a different period of history and gives insight into the 40's and 50's!
B0014VQGX4|5.0|I bought this toy for my 3yr old son. This is a quality product. My son is interested in vehicles of all types, but especially the construction variety. This toy is very detailed and well constructed. The front bucket has two positions - up or down and it tilts. The backhoe locks in position when it is fully vertical, while the stabilizers lock in the up or down positions. The seat and steering wheel both turn 360 degrees. The tires are pliable - I'm not sure if they are made of vinyl or rubber - but it adds a measure of authenticity.     I would definitely buy this item again and I will think of Bruder first the next time I need a truck toy.
0316098337|4.0|I heard about this book on NPR and was intrigued enough to buy it in hard cover immediately. If you give up on books easily......hang on and keep reading. Just when I thought I was tired of reading about a boy who was raised in one room - only one room - with only one person - for five long years....the book changed! I love the story line as a whole, and was encouraged that such a damaged family unit could flourish in the wild world. I recommend it to all my friends, and encourage them to keep with the story until the end!
B0033ZJBJK|5.0|Great (\\"adult\\") love story! I wholeheartedly recommend this a fun story for those who came of age in the (post) X-Files period.     Listening to the audio books was my first exposure to the Twilight Series. I am about a decade removed from watching teen flics and am not usually a fan of romances - except for the 19th c. kind. But Keith Turan's review of the initial Twilight film, in which he extolled the movie as an unabashed and \\"Swooningly Risky Romance\\" peaked my interest [...]. These are GREAT STORIES! Listening transported me back to the feelings of intense romantic love and infatuation, not so much of the high school days (yikes!) but rather the feelings of first being engaged to be married. (A[...]) But, be forewarned, it is not a \\"sweet\\" fairytale story. (More \\"Grimm\\" than \\"Mother Goose.) Certainly not appropriate for kids. The sexual encounters are more (ahem) detailed than is probably necessary but, on the other hand, the story isn't as violent as the precursor \\"Eclipse.\\"      I often listen to audiobooks (e.g. while cleaning house and running errands in the car) and this story is well suited to the genre: it is action-packed and full-to-bursting with game-changing, though not complex, plot twists. And though the dialogue can be a little repetitive, it's perfect for an audiobook where the listener's attention isn't consistently focused. I could tune out for a few minutes or so while focusing on my other tasks at hand and not lose the story. I would add a not of caution, though: if there are young ones around, wear headphones.     One a final note, Ilyana Kadushin is a great read. Her youthful-sounding voice is a good match for the Meyer's teenage protagonist. Though, I can imagine that if one is accustomed to hearing the screen actors instead, then it would be distracting.
1594202842|5.0|After all the reviews I had to download and read this myself. My comment: Chua's insane. But I admire her. The thing is, despite how crazy her parenting style might be, she's always there with her children. She believes in them. Actually, she believes in all humans (AND dogs). She's the kind of person who believes in the human potential. That everbody's got the ability to excel if they keep trying. Practice, practice, practice is the key. And due to her belief she acts the way she does.<br /><br />To Chua childhood is the time to prepare for adulthood. She knows from her experience how competitive it is out there. So all she wanted to do and did was prepare her kids to be a fighter, to not give up, and do their very best. Every good mother wants that. As hard as she was with the girls, before the big event she'd tell her daughters that it didn't matter what the outcome was. But knowing that the girls gave everything they got for the big day, was what mattered (although of course the highest possible award was always Chua's goal for the girls).<br /><br />I grew up with a Chinese dad. It was no slumber party, no extra curriculum, anything but an A was unacceptable, and even after being first in class it wasn't \\"great job\\" that I heard but it was \\"do better next time\\". But, unlike Chua's girls, I had to figure out how to do better on my own and if I made a mistake, even the smallest thing, he'd not speak to me for a day at least. I'd trade all the yelling, screaming, practice until midnight for the silence and having to try to figure out how to be the best on my own. I did the Lulu. I still did well but there was no more do better next time after middle school.<br /><br />I loved the book. It's a quick read, it's got many funny parts (she's got a dry and sarcastic kind of humor), it even has some sad parts, and all in all very personal. I think, despite her still believing that the \\"Chinese\\" way is better, she knows now that it's not for all. It didn't work for her dogs and it it could have been dangerous with Lulu if Chua didn't do the right thing after the big blow-up.<br /><br />I have two daughters. It's great to know that there's somebody who's 30x more intense than I am. We have no TV at home, no DVD player in car, and we practice math and reading everyday (1st grader). Our first grader has guitar lessons on Saturdays and she was in gymnastics (we moved and still on waiting list) but they're just for fun even though she might be really good in guitar (music runs in my family) and gymnastics if I push it like Chua. I make her practice a few times a week but there's no yelling or screaming.<br /><br />It's a shame that Chua got such negative comments based on the excerpt. Yes Chua's extreme, yes some of the things she did was crazy but her kids did turn out incredible and based on the letter from her eldest daughter Chua taught them many valuable lessons on how to take on life's many challenges.ve been dangerous with Lulu if Chua didn't do the right thing after the big blow-up.

0380820846|2.0|If you read this book in the series first you will not want to read the other books in the series.  Too much time communicating about previous present feelings and emotions.  I thought the book did not live up to it's title.  Very little romance or excitement until the end of the book.  This book should be removed from the series.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|This was amazing.     Throughout the season, we watch Dexter struggle with the different parts of his life. His serial killer personality and his cover personality really start to collide. Now with the responsibility of his own child affecting him, Dexter begins to evolve again.     The drama intensity is here again, as it always is with the series, but this season holds more emotion than previously thought. There are moments where I as a viewer was shocked at the severity of Dexter's emotional commitment and involvement. He begins to understand and experience more emotions than in previous seasons. (protectiveness, jealousy, worry, and remorse hit him especially hard).     Of course, the series ends with a great climax that leaves your heart strings plucked, and you feel a lot like Dexter himself ... .. \\"What now?\\"

B000DWMYQ8|4.0|I need an answer to a question concerning the case. I recently bought a used Chicken Little movie and it had a cheap flimsy case wirh a frame backing covered over with transparent material. Did Disney do that or did the seller?

B002UXRGLG|5.0|I bought this for my family for Christmas and it turned out to be the perfect \\"down time\\" experience.  We are super busy all of the time but during Christmas break we snuggled on the couch with the snow coming down outside and watched these videos.  The kids (12,10 & 9 yrs) were as enthralled as the adults.  It also opened up conversation around there being a big, amazing world out there to explore.  I prefer this BBC edition as the narrator was excellent as well.  I bought this along with Great Migrations made by National Geographic and got a great deal through Amazon.
B003L20IFQ|4.0|Bring on the big booms!?!?  Anyone?<br />Fast cars...acrobatic stunts...bullets whizzing by...<br />Maybe some models in string bikinis?<br /><br />(cricket, cricket)<br /><br />Nope, it ain't gonna happen here.  Don't be expecting flashbacks and dream sequences invading an intricate storyline with complex twists and turns.  The 90 minute runtime never for a moment strays away from its confiscated setting.  That's right, an hour and a half watching pretty boy Ryan Reynolds trapped in a box.  Patience will be required.<br /><br />Claustrophobes, this is most likely your worst nightmare.  Heck, it's be tough on anyone--precious little air, hardly any light, a cellphone with the battery draining...I'm guessing he probably crapped his pants too.  Oh, dirt is seeping in the coffin as well, so homeboy is getting smothered and covered like my Waffle House hashbrowns.  Plus there might be a few surprises and unexpected dangers that are soon revealed.<br /><br />One thing is for certain--Reynolds can act.  No more is his relegated exclusively to the smart-aleck, penis & fart joke roles.  A remarkable performance.  He plays a civilian truck driver in Iraq that wakes up buried alive.  Sheesh!  That's worse than gaining consciousness next to a dead hooker.  Fortunately he has a cell phone, and he frantically calls different numbers for help.<br /><br />Buried is shot in real time and has some subtle but provocative points.  Director Rodrigo Cortes even expertly mixes in some sly dark comedy.  It all amounts to a slow-paced, tension-filled drama that is quite a revealing character study.  It definitely won't appeal to the masses, but it's an excellent change of pace so rarely attempted in cinema.

There are 2 outtakes on \\"Music From...\\" called \\"Stone Cold Mess\\" and \\"Mission On 2nd\\" which are NOT on this issue - the band probably didn't want to duplicate what fans have already bought.

There's the original Joe Henry liner notes from December 1991 with new photos of the boys in the studio, out on the road, typed and handwritten lyric sheets - it's very nicely done and in keeping with the original artwork.<br /><br />The original tapes have been remastered by VIC ANESINI (he also did the \\"Music From The North Country\\" set) and the sound quality is BEAUTIFUL - so sweet and warm. Tracks like \\"Waiting For The Sun\\", \\"Martin's Song\\" and \\"Settled Down Like Rain\\" were standouts anyway on the original CD, but here they sound just gorgeous. The remaster also makes you rehear a lot of the lesser-lauded gems on the record like the plaintive Ryan Adams guitar-feel of \\"Take Me With You (When You Go)\\" and \\"Nevada, California\\" - they now sound 'so' good and as growers - they've have stood the test of time.<br /><br />To sum up - the remaster is superlative, the booklet is improved and the 5 bonus tracks are cleverly chosen and worthy additions.<br /><br />Very, very good indeed....and as a band...I sorely miss them.

B003EY7IRC|4.0|Finally the end, or is it? Did you catch the page after The End. The one that said only \\"for now\\"    I was so glad Karen did not hit us with an over the top \\"miracle\\" that put everything back as it was BWC.  It was a long road for all of us but we are left with hope. Fae still need to be pushed back. Characters like Dani and Christian still have stories to be told. A new Queen (or King) need to be found (or do they).    They say the mark of a great author is to leave you wanting more. Ms Moning you have left this reader wanting much more!
0439023483|3.0|All of my bibliophilic friends in the blogosphere told me I had to read Hunger Games.  There's a reason I don't read contemporary fiction.  I think there's enough ugliness and drama in the world.  I don't want to read about it too.  So, even though I'm not a fan of Dystopian themes, I picked it up.  I'm still not sure what all the fuss is about.<br /><br />I found the premise appalling.  I know, I know, that's the whole point of Dystopian themes, the shock value.  Still, reading it made me feel uncomfortable (again, I know that's the point), but it made it hard for me to engage with the book. So it's not my genre.  Even if I couldn't appreciate the theme, I strove to appreciate it other ways.<br /><br />However, the plot was rather predictable.  I knew how it was going to end (and not because I was spoiled), it was just a matter of how Suzanne Collins would take the reader from point A to point B. For me, it was straight forward and without surprises.  It was the love story, or pseudo-love story, that finally made the read accessible to me.  Once I found a likable, character, and for me it wasn't Katniss, it did become a somewhat compelling read.  (Although, I think it was more of an 'I want to keep reading so I can be done with it,' than an 'I want to keep reading.') I didn't find Katniss to be a remarkable female character.  Yes, she volunteered to die in place of her sister, but in the end, it was her hunting skills and her comprehension of game theory that saved the day ...and she listened to her advisor.<br /><br />It was well written. Though some of the negative reviews I've seen cast aspersions on Collins' writing style, I don't agree with any of them.  I don't fault the writing, I just don't appreciate the plot.<br /><br />While I will continue to press on in the series, I don't think I'm the target audience.  If I want to read about atrocities, I'll read the non-fiction accounts, not waste my imagination on more horrifying ones.<br /><br />[...]

B0049OSQ18|5.0|The D's are a great band and this is a great album, filled with inflected alt-country tunes and while the second song is a clear parody of an REM song, that's alright.  I love this band.  Gillian Welch was good, I like the girl singer in this band better though.  But it's all good.  Anything this band does I will go along with.
B0041YI4ZO|2.0|I order this DVD from ying138, and the quality is good, there are Chinese audio  and English subtitle.    However, from the martial arts point of view, I am very disappointed with the martial arts choreographer/director, the actors' performances and the filming techniques. The Wing Chun performance in this movie is very ineffective, weak, there is no energy, and unrealistic. There is no real body structure, power and spirit in the performance. It is terrible, comparing to some other older movies such as \\"[[ASIN:B000J9YJT0 The Prodigal Son]]\\" or \\"[[ASIN:B00005ALMW The Victim]]\\". The film techniques made the fights looked like a soap opera performance.    The story also contained a lot of completely bad historical tales. For instance, during his time, sifu Ip Man had never wanted to teach Wing Chun to foreigners. And it was one of the reasons why he disliked Bruce Lee. But in the movie, it showed that sifu Ip Man wanted to sell Wing Chun around the world.     And the things about authentic Wing Chun, the conflict between Ng' Chung So, Chen Wa Shun and Leung Bik were completely bogus. Besides, according to sifu Ip Ching and Ip Chun (two sons of sifu Ip Man), the very existence of the Leung Bik character was very questionable, as well as the time sifu Ip Man supposed to study Wing Chun in Hong Kong.    In the real life, father of sifu Ip Man was very wealthy, and sifu Ip Man never lived in the Wing Chun school.  The name of the Wing Chun school was not Jing Wu (as in the movie). In the real life, Jing Wu was the name of Huo Yuanjia's school in Shang Hai, as featured in some other movies such as \\"[[ASIN:B000K2UW06 Jet Li's Fearless]]\\", \\"[[ASIN:B00003W8NS Fist of Legend]]\\", \\"[[ASIN:B0015RCUR8 Fist Of Fury]]\\"    For people who know Wing Chun only through Ip Man's system (which seem to be the whole western world), sifu Ip Man was only one of millions Wing Chun practitioners. He happened to have a student which was the loud-mouth Bruce Lee, therefore he became famous. Although sifu Ip Man had great skills in Wing Chun, there were (and there are) many many others much better than him in Asia. And what the western world sees about Wing Chun is just a weak commercialized version of the true combat art.

0393327655|3.0|After reading Dawkins' THE GOD DELUSION (374 pages of actual material) and Hitchens' GOD IS NOT GREAT (283 pages), I wondered how Harris' small book of 227 pages could possibly contend.<br /><br />As it turns out, I felt that he often packed more punches per page than his fellow atheists.<br /><br />Seeing anti-God, -Faith, and -Religion arguments from a point of view of someone learned in neuroscience was definitely an eye-opener, and I found that I agreed with him on quite a few points:<br /><br />1) How certain religious beliefs (especially Islamic) can spell disaster for more--relatively--rational and peaceful countries and citizens.<br /><br />2) The hypocrisy of the War on Drugs when so many other crimes essentially amount to a slap on the wrist.<br /><br />3) The foolishness of a truly Pacifistic philosophy.<br /><br />4) How \\"spiritual intelligence\\" can be found in almost anything if we look hard enough--even a Hawaiian seafood recipe!<br /><br />All of the above arguments I found to be quite convincing and well-articulated. Despite his neuroscience background there were only a few parts difficult to grasp due to philosophical and scientific terminology and concepts. Most impressive was his well-documented Bibliography--a whopping ~30 pages! Indeed a LOT of research went into this book.<br /><br />However, Harris also has a few arguments that are sorely lacking in arguments and evidence.<br /><br />Harris--and indeed many atheists--contend that \\"We simply do not need religious ideas to motivate us to live ethical lives.\\" (page 172).<br />He also states that \\"We are the final judges of what is good, just as we remain the final judges of what is logical.\\" (page 226).<br /><br />In general I agree with the first statement that people, even without religion, will have some sort of moral compass.<br />The problem comes in realizing that each individual's concept of right and wrong on issue X is going to differ, which then raises the question: If 5 people have a gut feeling that abortion is wrong and 6 people have a gut feeling that it isn't, which group is ultimately \\"right\\"? Is it the decision of Harris' \\"world government\\" (page 151) that he claims we need? But even there, government is comprised of individuals. If people can't come to a unanimous agreement on \\"right\\" and \\"wrong\\" it is quite possible that, ultimately, violence between the two groups could break out--whether it's punching each other in the face or crashing planes into each other.<br />His best guess to the answer of \\"who's right and who's wrong?\\" is this:<br />\\"There will probably come a time when we achieve a detailed understanding of human happiness, and of ethical judgments themselves, at the level of the brain.\\" (page 175). So here stands mankind, thousands if not millions of years in the making, and even Sam Harris doesn't have an answer.<br /><br />Finally, Harris criticizes the religious concept of any Afterlife, only to make the following admissions:<br /><br />\\"But the truth is we simply do not know what happens after death.\\" (page 208)<br />\\"We do not know what awaits each of us after death, but we know that we will die.\\" (page 226)<br />\\"What happens after death is surely a mystery, as is the relationship between consciousness and the physical world.\\" (page 288)<br /><br />After reading such statements as these, it is apparent to me that the only way atheists are ever going to truly find out what happens one second after death, is to die and find out themselves. We can send a rocket to the moon, but we can't send test equipment beyond the land of the living and come back with evidence.<br /><br />As I've shown, there are both good and bad arguments to be had here, but if there's one thing I've come to learn it's that perhaps nothing kicks the mind into high-gear faster than picking up a book written by an atheist, opening your mind and considering the possibilities.
B0015DROBO|4.0|Great series, I was hooked the minute I read the first line. Why? Because the mystery was engrossing and multifaceted. Murder, lies, sex, the good and the bad, government intrigue, dysfunctional families all the things we love to read about. And an insight into the publishing, finance and computer worlds that I really never knew much about,explained in terms that gave  me if not a complete understanding an overview how these things work. And I knew nothing about Sweden, now I do!<br />The author gave a brief but in depth view into the minds of all his characters so you understood why they behaved they way they did. I read constantly and not many mysteries, but I like books that give their characters life. These people really had life!<br />I would recommend the series to anyone.
B0043URV8M|4.0|This is the first Harry Potter score that I've fallen in love with since John Williams left the helm after Prisoner of Azkaban (which is still by far my favorite of the scores, but Deathly Hallows now comes into a close second place).  The music is powerful, evocative, and rife with emotional layers that reflect the many complex themes occurring in this penultimate chapter of the Harry Potter movie saga.    The one weakness I find in the score is the theme of the Death Eaters.  While the theme works very well in the film, when taken out of that context and put onto an album the theme is rather redundant after the first few times you hear it and you wish it would develop into something different.  The theme hints very heavily to Patrick Doyle's theme for Voldemort from Goblet of Fire, which - I think is part of the problem.  Not that he hinted at Doyle, because actually one of the better aspects of Desplatt's score is that he hinted not only at Williams, but Doyle and Hooper as well, while maintaining his own unique and original sound.  The problem with hinting at Doyle's theme for Voldemort is the fact that Doyle's Voldemort theme was rather bland and uninteresting to begin with, and while I do feel that Desplat did a better job at developing his theme than Doyle did, it still comes off as repetitive after the first few listens.    This is where Williams was missed most on the last few scores - his ability to create a score that fits with the mood and pacing of the film AND at the same time create a score that can be taken out of the context of the film and still be enjoyable to listen to is unrivaled.  Desplat definitely came closer than Doyle or Hooper to achieving this Holy Grail that all film composers seek, but the Death Eater theme fell short.

030726999X|3.0|I read the first two and was so enchanted(if that is the right word) with Lisbeth Salander.I apologize to all the<br />people that are wild about it. My opinion is this book should all have been at the end of the second book. Tying up ends is all this book seems to be about. Maybe the first two were so exciting and intriguing, and the heroine was so unbeatable, that it was a come down. I thought there was something wrong with me. Everyone that I talked to to thought it was perfect(except it was the last. And he was gone alas!)He is a great Author. The books were great reading, but I must agree with the review that said, if he had lived he would probably have seriously edited it.

Looking at life through Ignatius' eyes is entertaining but I also feel how he struggles to live everyday life.    There are many levels to this wonderful book.
B000255LIY|5.0|I'm surely not a qualified critic but I watched the 1968 version last night then this Showtime version tonight. I like this newer version better. For me, even though Hepburn won an Oscar and O'Toole was nominated, the dialogue was \\"over-acted\\" in the 1968 production. In this version the dialogue flowed more freely and seemed more natural. Perhaps the costumes and scenery were not as authentic as the earlier version, but to me it was more visually pleasing. I purchased both versions and I'm sure I'll watch both again. I'll watch this version again---first.
B003EY7IRC|2.0|I wanted to love this book. In fact I took a vacation day from work so I could purposely stay home and read it. On top of that I ordered this on kindle and did NOT sleep until it downloaded so I could read it for a few hours. I expected it to catch and hold my attention the way the previous books did. I dont know if my expectations were to high but this book left a bland feeling in my mouth. First of all, the book goes through one twist and turn to the next. Instead of getting answers it just gave us more questions! WTH? I had to skip chapters, fast forward to the end, and back again just so I could get some concrete answers to the basic questions we've all been wondering since this series started. Who is Mac? What is Barrons? Will she pick Vlane? Is Barrons dead? SPOILER ALERT: New questions came up instead such as \\"What is Mac?\\" Is Alina really her sister?, who is the Unseelie King? etc. OMG a few chapters into the book I was so frustrated I literally had to stop reading it so give myself a break. As much as I love a good plot story I also want a story line that doesnt leave me feeling like I want to throw the book against the wall. I could NOT enjoy the story because of all the annoying \\"new\\" questions popping up without answering any of the old ones. Then to make matters worse. There were still unanswered questions AFTER the book ended. WTH?   I think I will attemp to re-read the story a second time and see if maybe now that I know some of the answers I could enjoy the book? I dont know. I was honestly annoyed with all the new ploys thrown. Also I think the author could have done this entire series in 3 books instead of 5. There were too many fillers and probably unnecessary scenes. I would BORROW this book from the library or if you can't wait and get frustated there is a SPOILERS link that will probably help you along.  I think the majority of the reviews on here was due to all the hype and anticipation. I honestly dont feel this was as spectacular as it couldhave and should have been. Although KMM is a great author there was just something lacking in this last book for the fever series.
0316098337|1.0|I have just started reading \\"Room\\", saw rave reviews for it everywhere,have been intending to read it for a while then saw it in my local library.   I am about 100 pages in and, quite frankly, am bored and skipping bits already. I presume that the main character Jack speaks as he does either because he is 5 years old (unlikely as my 3 year old nephew already speaks much better than that) or because he has never had enough contact with other people to develop his language skills sufficiently. Either way, it is off-putting after a while. Anyway I will give the book another chance and continue reading but I have my doubts.  I have now finished reading it and would agree with another reviewer who advises to forget trying if, after 100 pages, you are already fed up
0142000671|4.0|Of Mice and Men was a very good classic read. It amazed me at how quickly John Steinbeck was able to draw the reader into the book especially since it is a very short novel. I also liked the way he quickly gets you familiar with Lennie and George as well as the other characters and the important part each plays. It is definitely a classic that everyone must read.

B003L20IFQ|4.0|First of all be very careful when reading other reviews. I had the ending spoiled for me thanks to a careless reviewer.<br /><br />For what Buried is, an 80 minute movie featuring only one physical actor and taking place in a wooden box, it never gets boring, which is impressive. Claustrophobics will probably want to avoid this. I'm not claustrophobic but I found myself having to take huge breaths of air watching this. It's dark and very confined, and it's intense.  There are a few things in the movie that are totally unbelievable, which I won't mention to keep this as spoiler free as possible, but as long as you can suspend your disbelief (which you have to do with most movies) this is an enjoyable story.  Ryan Reynolds' acting is solid here. I actually cared about his character and felt all his anger, sadness and frustration throughout the course of the story.<br /><br />I don't think I've ever seen a movie that takes place in one small confined setting, which is what drew me to Buried in the first place. I highly recommend this. Watch it in a dark room with no distractions to really get into it.<br /><br />Extras on the Blu Ray were disappointing. Just a couple trailers and a making of featurette, in low definition, and only partially in english (some spoken Castilian Spanish with english subtitles - a spanish film afterall).
0316098337|5.0|This is an amazing book which I read in two days - no small feat with two children under four years of age.  It opens your eyes to the blessings we take for granted, namely freedom.  This wonderous and unique little boy shares his world with the reader, and one cannot help but marvel at the love his mother shares each day.  To be in this situation is unthinkable, and I don't know how she wouldn't lose her mind.  What kept grabbing my thoughts is the true story of Jaycee Dugard in California, a mother of two who was kidnapped at age eleven and raised two daughters before being rescued last year.  We are so used to our world and it's intricacies, but to put yourself in the mind of someone who has never known rain, trees, animals - truly deepened my empathy towards others in the world and broadened my own horizons.

0670050172|5.0|There are a number of books in our cannon of children's literature that should be read to or by every child.  This is one of those books.<br /><br />I recently purchased another consignment of mixed books and while digging through my almost sight unseen purchase, I came across this old friend and it rang bells instantly!  I was able to trip back through time to earlier days, delightful days, and relive this wonderful little story.  Long story short...I remember this one from when I was a wee kid.<br /><br />Robert McCloskey won the Caldecott Medal for this one and there are reasons for it.  He both created the text and the illustrations here and has blended them perfectly... more about that later.  It was first published around 1941 and has gone through several publications since that date.  The last one I am aware of is this 1969 one being featured here, but there quite well may be newer ones about.<br /><br />Basically this is the story of two ducks and their adventure of raising a family in Boston, MA.  The stories was developed by McCloskey after watching ducks near and about Boston Commons wend their way through traffic, both mechanized and foot.<br /><br />Anyway, Mr. and Mrs. Mallard come to the great city of Boston in search of a place to raise their family.  After many adventures and encounters with bicycles, cars, people and other rather intimidating city \\"things\\" they settle on the Public Gardens where they start raising their children, fuzzy little Jack, Kack, Lack, Mack, Nack, Quack and Pack.  Mr. Mallard, a sort of adventuresome and wayward duck goes off exploring and Mrs. Mallard must move the ducklings to another location to meet up with Mr. Mallard at a later date.  Their engaging journey through city streets and with the help of local authorities and good citizens comprise the rest of the story.<br /><br />There are some important aspects of this book that need to be noted:<br /><br />First, there is little anthropomorphizing here.  The ducks actually act like ducks throughout the entire story.  That does not make them any less endearing tough; no, it anything, it makes them more so.  Who on earth is not charmed by a determined mom-duck or little ducklings?<br /><br />Second; as pointed out by other reviewers here, there are actually 44 sounds in our (English) language, and this work incorporates all 44 in the text.  This is rather amazing!  This fact alone makes this work invaluable as a beginning reader.<br /><br />Third; My goodness, there is the art work.  The author has used chalk drawings, using a brownish tint, that would at first seem subdued, especially if compared with much of the work being done today, but subdued it is not.  It has a very \\"old timie\\" look to it which is absolutely delightful to the eye.<br /><br />Forth; I must echo the warning of another reviewer here.  Many of these older books (the one I have here is one of the originals), are in rather sorry shape and I must warn you that many of these old books have a mold problem.  This is dangerous stuff folks and if you purchase a copy and find the slightest hint of musty smell, get it out of the house!  This mold is extremely dangerous for adults and it can be devastating for children.<br /><br />If you can get a nice clean copy; something that should not to too difficult to do, then this is most certainly one that you will want to provide your young reader.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks.

0385341679|5.0|Loved this book. Twists and turns and enough action to keep me interested the whole time.  Just when you think you HAVE IT, you realize you don't have a clue!  At one point towards the end of the book I THOUGHT the storyline was taking a serious turn away from the entire focus of the whole series, then POW, you burst THAT bubble Ms. Moning!!!    SPOLIER ALERT!!!***********************    Don't read any further if you don't want to know how I feel about \\"unknotted threads\\" at the end of this book.      SPOILER ALERT AGAIN***************    Ok, if you are still reading this review, it means you want to know how I feel about the ending?  I am SURE there are at least 2 more books that will be coming someday; one that involves a Highlander who ate some Unseelie and one that involves Dani. And WHO is DANCER? Hmmm, a little untied thread that needs a knot.      OK TO READ AGAIN< NO MORE SPOILERR>>>>>>>>>>>>>>    All in all I gave the book 5 stars. If I see a little bleeding from the tales of J K Rowling, (who I had to say did some bleeding from J R R Tolkien,) well we ARE talking about the details of worlds none of us have ever traveled to/in/of. Or have we? Are there secrets we all keep about the monsters that go bump in the night?? Until then, Great Job Ms. MONING, Great job!!!  See you in Faery!

0553805371|4.0|Stephen Hawking is the Einstein of his generation and this book is a better attempt at educating his generation to physics than his previous books. With his landmark book \\"A Brief History of Time\\" he captured the imaginations of an entire generation of the non-science educated masses. Unfortunately, only a few MIT professors could read and understand, \\"A Brief History of Time.\\" With \\"The Grand Design\\" he brings such items as the M-Theory, the four forces of nature and the search for a Grand Unifying Theory (the theory to unite the macro and micro in physics) down to the level where even a former sports reporter can understand. The greatest criticism of the first book was that it was too complicated to understand, this one would be it is a little too oversimplified. But Hawking is striving to reach even more and to educate them to physics and the world of science. For anyone looking to get an overall view of the physics world this is an excellent place to start. The basic thrust of the book is that there might not be one Grand Unifying Theory and that there are different answers at different levels. Another arguement that he puts forth, and does throughout the book, is how science and reason can refute religion and mythology.  This is a well-executed book and should lead to investigating more in the realm of physics.
0395389496|5.0|I have always loved all of the books written by Chris Van Allsburg.  Years ago when this Caldecott Award Winner first came out and we received it into our school library collection at H.L.Johnson Elementary in Royal Plam Beach, Florida.  Our media staff sat down and read it cover to cover.  It was just wondeful!  We decieded to produce a \\"Christmas Show\\" using this book.  We had in house Television throughout our school and so we were able to broadcast our program to the entire school (which was more than 1200 students).  Our Media specialist Jane Terwillegar read the story as only she could (which was wonderful), Sue turned the pages of the book and I ran the camera and filmed the whole production.  It was just wonderful.  I remember going out to the store to purchase a \\"bell' that had the perfect tone. I just loved reading this book to my children at Christmas under the lights of our tree and then ringing the bell, it truly gave you chills.  I was tuly excited when the movie was finally made using Tom Hanks(only he could have been the one to do this), it brought me back to when we first read this story so many years ago.  You see I had given my copy of the original book to my Granddaughter Juliane. I have felt for years felt that I should purchase a copy for myself and so I did just that.  This book has beautiful illustrations, and the story resonates with all of us who still \\"Believe\\".  Yes I do still \\"Believe\\" and I always will, for even in these times when money is tight...If you truly believe...there will always be a way to have \\"Christmas\\" in your life and heart.  Thank you Amazon, for your time and for my own \\"Wonderful\\" book.<br />  Melody A. Martin
0385341679|5.0|I thought this \\"final\\" book was extremely well written and it was a very satisfying finale to the series.  At a whopping 600 pages, Moning doesn't skimp on the details, and nothing feels rushed.  I also thought it was brilliant that Moning brought in many of her Highland series characters - it made me want to immediately re-read that series after I finished Shadowfever.  I'm very excited that she's working on a new series based on the Fever world - once you've read Shadowfever it is easy to imagine which characters the new series will include, and I'm already looking forward to the first book.  One slightly disappointing detail of Shadowfever though - SPOILER ALERT - is that although we find out what Barrons is (physically), and what the creature in the basement is, Moning gave us almost no information about the how, why, and who of the cause and circumstances.  And Mac seemed to have no interest whatsoever in the origin of the creature in the basement, and how Barrons might have felt about it's biological origin.  I know that's vague, but I don't want to inadvertantly spoil it for anyone.  If you've read it, you know what I mean.  Mac is the jealous type, and I don't see her not asking questions about it.  I can only hope that Moning left out the details for a reason, and that we'll get further information in the new series. Can't wait!
B001TLZRZW|5.0|This CD is absolutely AMAZING!! It starts off with a pretty mellow, somber intro, and then goes into a full throttle assult the entire rest of the album. My only complaint with this album, is that it was not longer. I honestly felt with my very first listen to the cd in its entirety, That I had just gone 12 rounds with \\"Iron\\" Mike Tyson back in his prime. This cd punches you in the face with Track #2 and does not let up until the very last string on the guitar is strung, leaving the listener with 2 black eyes. If you are a fan and kind of on the ledge of purchasing this album. TAKE THE PLUNGE! this cd is without a doubt the best ive herard in years. I somewhat feel betrayed that a 5 star is the highest I could give this!      GO GET IT, YOU WILL THROUGHLY ENJOY!
0316096199|5.0|I cannot express how much I loved this book. It is the story of a woman's pain and the journey she went on as the aftermath of being raped. It is an incredible story, and I love the way it is written and how real it is.  It is absolutely terrible the way rape survivors are treated. Even her father seemed to think that it was partially her fault. Though she was a virgin at the time, it was almost as if her father was accusing her of putting out when the police report showed the attacker lost his knife before he actually raped her. I think rape was misunderstood then (30 years ago) and still somewhat misunderstood today.  I was rooting for Alice through out the book. It is amazing how people will treat the victims of violent crime. To see the story through her eyes, to feel the stares of the classmates who knew what had happened, to feel as if her mother's panic attacks would take precedent over what had happened to her, her parents not being quite as supportive as would be expected of the average parent - it's so unbelievable and yet, I feel almost as if I know her, as if she is someone I know - a real, living person I'm acquainted with.   Living near where she grew up, I felt a connection to her every time she mentions a place in PA. I found her relatable, even though I've never been raped.   Reading the story, I sometimes had to remind myself that this is a real person I'm reading about - not a fictional character. I say this because I think there can be a bit of a disconnect when a real person's story is as unforgettable and moving as this one.   The part I couldn't relate to is when, years after the rape, she starts heavy drug usage to get her mind off of her feelings. I couldn't really relate to that, nor to experimenting in college. I'm sure others can, though. She didn't do these things alone. Also, it was her way of dealing with PTSD, and having never gone through anything so traumatic, it makes sense that I wouldn't be using drugs to get away from dealing with those feelings.   On the whole, I would highly recommend this book with a caveat: you must be able to read graphic rape details and deal with the irreverent things Alice says. She can be a bit... crass and occasionally her statements may shock you. I also say caution to those of you with virgin ears - she curses quite a bit as do others.

B00377V6J2|5.0|Absolutely fantastic! This was made for television but the old version cut out a lot for commercials. This current version has more music. It's great to see these two artists together - and sad to think they are gone. Lots of on-the-fly improvising. Plug it in and turn up the volume! And these entries aren't short versions; both artists get all they can out of each piece, sometimes transitioning into another tune and even changing guitars right in the middle. The back up musicians are top notch (keyboard, bass, drums) and do a great job giving these two legends the base they need to really shine. A must for blues and for guitar lovers, you feel like you're right there in the studio with them.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|Well the wait is finally over and the \\"Fever\\" has abated...for now.<br /><br />Shadowfever with it's epic twists and turns, OMG, WTF??? is going on, head scratching moments is one book that I think wrung every emotion possible from me while reading it.<br /><br />I am happy and sad for the end of Shadow fever at the same time. Happy to have been able to experience the \\"fever\\" phenomenon and sad that my love affair with the sexy Jericho Barrons is over. Never has a character in a book so totally captivated and held my action as the enigmatic Barrons. I feel as if I've said good-bye to a lover and good friend I may never hear from again *sniff*.<br /><br />From heart-wrenching despair to unbelievable hope in the impossible, betrayal, terror, laughter and ever lasting love each turn of the page brought fresh emotion. And just when you thing Moning can't possibly have any more surprises up her sleeve, she kicks it up a notch and fries your brain one more time with the complexities of her story of Fae and mortals and immortals.<br /><br />I think anyone who has read, been invested in and eagerly anticipating this fifth and final book will be happy with the outcome, having most of the loose ends tied up in a neat rainbow coloured bow. Did we get all he answers? No I don't think so, but I can put this book to rest and be satisfied with the ending. Besides Moning has stated there is still more Fae story to be told, so she has to keep some things under wraps.<br /><br />If Shadowfever was a ride at the fair it would be the biggest, baddest, most thrilling roller-coaster ride one could ever take. And when it was over, you'd be back in line asking to do it all over again and again.<br /><br />So farewell Barrons...until we meet again...even if it is only in my dreams!<br /><br />Thanks for the ride

I really hope the series continues...
0316098337|5.0|Room: A Novel is an unusual and splendid book. It is primarily about the abduction and kidnapping of a 19 year old college student and her seven years in captivity. During her time in captivity, she gives birth to a son named Jack who is five years old at the time the story begins. The novel is told in his voice and from his point of view. Jack is precocious, loving, observant and happy which may be difficult to believe as he and his mother are prisoners in an 11' x 11' room for all of Jack' life. Jack's mother has an organized week for both of them. They bathe, exercise by running around the room, read books, sing, play games, and wait frighteningly for \\"Old Nick\\", their captor, to come into their room most nights. Jack knows nothing of life outside \\"room\\". \\"Room\\" is his world and he doesn't understand what \\"outside\\" is despite watching television and having his mother carefully and repeatedly explain it.<br /><br />Through a clever and scary plot, Jack and his mother escape and this novel is as much about their their experiences in the world outside their small room as it is about their captivity. Jack and his mother go to a rehab center to help heal their psychological scars and transition them into the world. Jack's mother has been in agony for years because of her bad teeth and she is getting these seen to as well. We meet Jack's extended family and see their reactions to him. He is, after all, the child of rape but he is his mother's great love and he is just Jack, the wonderful five year old. I have never met a character like Jack - five years old and with the capacity to feel compassion, observe perspicaciously and reason almost like an adult. He is a gift to his mother and I had the feeling that she wouldn't have survived those years without Jack. Throughout her captivity, she made every effort to not let her captor see or touch Jack. On the whole, she was successful.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone who likes to read. It is a story of human heartbreak, hope, and resilience. Emma Donoghue catches the dialogue right on and there is never an off-beat. It is one of the most unique books I've ever read and a gift to any reader who finds it.ilience.

I stopped wearing it for awhile, about four years, and when i picked it back up, I replaced the battery & it started ticking instantly. The watch has done everything as advertised, and I have even used it for LIGHT scuba >15ft. Pool Work. I wouldn't recommend this for scuba. But this watch is great. It's still running on the same battery since 2007 & it keeps about -1sec for every 3 days. Thats pretty good for an unregulated watch for under $200.

B004EC5IUW|5.0|I have loved Eva for almost 15 years - it was one of the anime that truly defined me as an otaku. While I was initially suspicious of the new Rebuilds, I have been pleasantly surprised. I was given the opportunity to see Eva 2.0 on the big screen last night, and I was beyond impressed. However, the quality of that screening was quite poor (it was almost like a fansub), and I'm eager for this blu-ray version.<br /><br />I have one small quibble with this chapter of the Rebuild, and for people completely unfamiliar with the series, this will be a  VERY SMALL SPOILER, so you've been warned.<br /><br />My beef is with the new pilot exclusive to the Rebuild: Mari Illustrious Makinami. While very cool, she feels completely tacked on, and not integrated well into the plot at all. She comes in, says some funny things, fights, and then...nothing. She's just a distraction. A mildly entertaining distraction, but an awkward one as well. If she was excised from the movie, it would not affect the story in any way, shape or form. I'm sure she'll become more important in 3.0, but for now...thumbs down.<br /><br />Otherwise, this was an incredible movie. Miss it at your own peril.

073937771X|5.0|Although hard to follow at first because of so many characters, it is very rewarding once you and the story focuses on the main characters.  It is not just an exciting story; it also has a very feminist message, and is an indictment of male machoism and sadism.  I could have done without all the specific street names that only a Swede would know, but given the very involved plot and the message it sends, I rate it a Most Memorable Read!  Five Stars! Read the whole trilogy, and you won't be disappointed.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|There are a lot of great features.  This is so much more powerful than my SB-400 that I had to make adjustments to the exposure.  Great flash with all of the toys.  Great choice for my D40X because this flash has a commander mode, it's smaller than the SB-800 & SB-900 plus it has a built in bounce card and diffuser.

B000HEWEEY|5.0|I purchased this DVD because of the newly Remastered Sound Track that is now in Dolby 5.1  What you get for this low, low price is outstanding.

A fabulous movie, with Robby the Robot. Lost Footage, 3 Documentries, Deleted Scenes, excerpts from The MGM Parade TV Series. LOBBY CARDS, and the coolest Robby the Robot Figure, about 3 inches Tall. Detailed, and with beautiful color on the figure. I was born in 1965. You DO NOT need to be a 50's child / adult to appreciate this fantastic Sci-fi Cult Classic, Forbidden Planet.   Very Very cool. I highly recommend this collection, which by the way is housed in a really cool colorful tin, with cover.  Five Stars all the way.
0810994739|1.0|I don't understand all the fuss about these books.  Greg, the main character, tortures his best friend.  He's lazy.  He lies.  He deliberately manipulates his family.<br /><br />And worst of all, he's a bully.<br /><br />In the second book, for example, we spend considerable time on a storyline in which Greg pretends one of his classmates doesn't exist. He refuses to acknowledge the other boy's existence--won't talk to him, pretends not to see him, says mean and cutting things about him while he's standing there--and the \\"game\\" spreads to the other kids in school, until none of the other kids acknowledge the boy's existence, either.  The boy is reduced to tears in one scene, and Greg thinks this is just wonderful because he himself isn't on the receiving end of the humor.  Eventually, Greg is called into the principal's office about it, but the principal gets the names mixed up (the boy is foreign, see, and his name is strange--har har har) and he ends up telling Greg to apologize to the wrong kid, which Greg happily does, and he goes right on with his little game until the boy's father comes over to Greg's house.  Greg thinks he's in big trouble, but by now the boy is so starved for human contact that he willingly plays video games with Greg.  End of story.<br /><br />This kind of stuff happens all the time.  Greg deliberately uses safety patrol to get out of math class and then scares the kindergartners he's supposed to be helping until one of them pees his pants.  He writes a comic strip for the school newspaper that makes fun of other students.  He hides a barbell in a pillow so his best friend trips on it and breaks his toe.  He cheats on tests at school.  He puts off doing class projects and then gets his dad to them for him.  And he's never called to account for any of this.  He never gets into major trouble (his ineffective mother occasionally grounds him, but he always weasels out of it), he never loses any friends, his teachers never say anything.<br /><br />This is supposed to be a likable protagonist?  I feel no sympathy for Greg.  I want to see him get what's coming to him, or at least be forced to see what a little creep he is, and I'm always disappointed when it doesn't happen.  Bart Simpson, in contrast, has moments when he does nice things for people, and he at least admits that the bad things he does are indeed bad.  Greg doesn't do anything nice for anybody and doesn't seem to realize or care that he's a monster.<br /><br />At the end of each book, the several disparate plotlines inevitably come smashing together in a big dogpile, and in the books I've read so far, they get resolved by sheer chance.

The books are supposed to be funny, but they're funny like that obnoxious uncle every family has, the one who says, \\"Hey, fatso--when's the baby due?  Aw, you know I'm just kidding around.\\"    Give them a miss, folks.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|i loved this movie! it's one of those movies that you would think would only be good for kids, but adults will fall in love too! it has good humor and a sweet side to it as well. i give it 5 stars! and i will definitely be purchasing the DVD soon! :-)
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Highly anticipatted ending to the Hunger Games Triology, the language used is quite interesting. The plot is real-life-like, twistted with loses and hopes. However, it was a bit to trigic for my tastes, maybe because of how real it seemed.
1400052173|5.0|I read it in a day. I had it in my \\"to read\\" list for month and months.  Now I wonder why it took me so long to pick it up. I think most people now know this is the story of how one woman's cells have driven medical research for the past 50 years.  The intersection of this family and science is both enlightening and humanizing.<br /><br />Like all great non-fiction reads it has elements of drama, great pace and tells an important story. It equally educates and broadens the mind. I have a limited science background but I want technical details which Rebecca Skloot presents. I equally want to see that the writer's effort is up to the story being told. Skloot put in 10 years of dogged effort to bring this to us. Her sacrifice and dedication is to be commended. Her research is so impressive. Just look through her acknowledgements at the end!<br /><br />To the Lacks family I think we owe gratitude not just for the contribution of the cells but for their kindness through adversity as best portrayed by Henrietta's daughter Dale. Their grace and appreciation for science and progress is genuine and yet their own access this dramatically improving healthcare is so triflingly small.<br /><br />Skloot does such a wonderful job giving anecdotes and examples to describe the medical field practices through the past 50 to 100 years. We are so much more advanced today. Not just better science but better procedures, accountability and transparency. We have a long way to go but we only get there but having the substance of books like this to learn from. She's done a fantastic job in pushing the debate on medical practices and particularly research back to the front page.<br /><br />I loved it. I had not expected to. I wish the Lacks well and will be contributing to the Foundation.
B0040QYROK|4.0|I've come to appreciate the history behind this film almost as much as the movie itself. It's great to see the most complete version put together on blu-ray. My only real complaint is what I think most people online agree with on this release - not enough bonus content. The previous release by Kino included a wonderful commentary and an interview with the restoration crew. This version comes with a documentary on the finding of the Buenos Aires footage, which is great, and a short interview with the people who brought it to light. But why not carry over the previous features to this version to truly make it a complete release? The video and audio are going to look the best that they can here but it's a waste of the format not to include more content to justify the higher price, particularly if it's material that was previously available earlier. If you're a completist I'd recommend checking out the Masters of Cinema version before purchasing this one.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|Wow! I don't even listen to music like this that often - I'm mostly a rocker - but I streamed this album like 5 consecutive times over on Rdio before realizing I simply had to have it! Catchy rhythms, hooks and smart lyrics abound and Mars' appealing vocals are infectious.  Imminently listen-able; no filler here whatsoever. Easily one of 2010's best efforts. Grab this CD up!
B000VECAEO|5.0|I was very pleased with this order.  It came within 48 hours.  The price was better than I could have gotten on Black Friday! It came in perfect condition.
B002EEY8JO|5.0|The movie came in no time and it was exactly what i ordered so i am very satisfied wih my purchase

B004BA576C|5.0|I started GMAT Club - online MBA community; my GMAT score is 750 (49, 42), and here are my thoughts about this book:     Strengths:   1. 907 real GMAT questions retired from past tests   2. Practice questions are organized by level of difficulty   3. Practice questions follow actual GMAT test patterns (it's great to have one's ear trained, esp. in verbal)   4. Contains a 100-question diagnostic test     Weaknesses:   1. Does not include any test-taking strategies   2. Though it has a few short review sections for each area, they are weak and very unfriendly   3. Questions are predominantly low to medium in difficulty which is often not representative of questions one encounters on the test   4. There is a 66% overlap with the previous version (11th edition)     Contents (number of questions per section):   1. Diagnostic Test - 100 questions   2. Problem Solving - 230 questions   3. Data Sufficiency - 174 questions   4. Reading Comprehension - 139 questions   5. Critical Reasoning - 124 questions   6. Sentence Correction - 140 questions     * Why is this book valuable/must-have?   The Official Guide is published by the creators of the GMAT and therefore it is the only source of actual GMAT questions representative of what you will see on the test.     * Why is the book not sufficient by itself?   This Guide contains only questions and lacks insightful information about the test, a math/verbal concept review section, or any test-taking strategies. To get up to speed, you will need to get a study guide such as Kaplan Premier Program or Princeton Review's Cracking the GMAT Cat.     * How should this book be used?   This book should NOT be used as a study-guide. It is a collection of questions - think of it as a way to practice your test-taking strategies but not a way to learn them.     * What if I own a previous edition of this book?   If you have the 11th edition, the only difference between the two is 300 new questions, or about 30%. Most test-takers agree that 300 new questions is not a compelling enough reason to own both editions, as the 11th edition offers enough practice. If you do need additional practice questions, get the Math or Verbal workbooks instead as they each have 300 questions.     * What is a recommended study plan using The Official Guide?   There are a number of approaches that work - here is one that most find reasonable:     Step 1: Buy a GMAT Guide from Kaplan or Princeton Review. Get familiar with the test and brush up on fundamentals (math and grammar); also these books will give you a good base for test-taking and timing strategies.     Step 2: Take a GMAT Prep (2 free tests downloadable from MBA.com) - but don't waste these; these are free but very valuable tests. Take 1 after you go through the Guidebooks and save the second one for later. These tests will be representative of your GMAT score (plus/minus 40 points).     Step 3: (Optional - if you want a 650+ score) Get a specialized Math and/or Verbal workbook from Kaplan, the 8-book set form Manhattan GMAT and do a deep dive into the fundamentals - this is what will help you crack the test - solid knowledge of Math and Grammar.     Step 4: By now you should have a good understanding of question patterns, strategies, and timing. Start working on the Official Guide and honing your skills - this is especially important for Critical Reasoning questions that have certain unspoken patterns and rules that only the Official Guide offers - work through the questions to train your ear. Keep in mind that these questions are on the easier side if you are aiming for 650+.
B0029LX2LC|5.0|Awesome album, it gets better the more you listen to it.  There isn't a single weak track.  If you like the old school Roots from Do You Want More ?!?!?  That raw sounding Roots, this is the album for you.  Don't think about it just go get it.    Definitely best tracks on this album are:  Walk Alone  Dear God  How I Got Over  Right On  The Fire
B0037KMHRY|4.0|I am a huge fan of Daft Punk, so I love the album. But I have to admit I was a bit disappointed because I expected something more like a Daft Punk album. This is a soundtrack so it includes the songs in the movie, being most of them not \\"hit\\" songs.    Derezzed is a masterpiece, but I can't stop listening to End of Line
B001PPGAIA|3.0|`Australia' is a film that is not quite sure of what it is. Starting off as a comedy with lots of typical Baz Luhrmann style direction, it then changes tack to become a more serious story of life travelling through the outback, with a hint of romance thrown in for good measure. The first half of the film follows Nicole Kidman, as Lady Ashley, who inherits her husbands cattle ranch and sets off to take the cattle to Darwin with the assistance of Hugh Jackman as the cattle drover. They are harassed and persecuted the whole journey by an unscrupulous rival and his henchman. The second half looks at their life afterward during the war. That is the story in a nutshell and it manages to keep you relatively interested for the duration, despite it's length and overblown direction. In fact it would have been better if it was shorter and focused just on the first aspect, with a few of the later loose ends tied up, instead of adding the extra hour of unnecessary storyline. This is quite corny in places (which is becoming a trademark of Luhrmann) and whilst the sweeping landscapes and overhead shots may look impressive, you get the feeling by the time you are half way through that this is a glorified promotional film from the Australian tourist board. There is a distinct lack of chemistry between Kidman and Jackman and both of their accents (plummy English lady and salt of the earth Aussie bushman) start to grate by the end. In fact the best actor has to be the aboriginal boy who travels with them on the cattle drive and he carries off an impressive performance. Saying all that, this is a watchable film and despite it's flaws it still enjoyable, although at this length it really is a film you'd only watch once.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B003NFM3JU|5.0|Wasn't sure what to expect when my son asked me to by this to watch on the 3D TV I bought him for Christmas.  I was very pleasantly surprised. I was expecting typical Disney and Jim Carey high comedy instead this version was more frightening ala the book.  The 3D effects really enhanced the storyline.
B000BISBDY|5.0|This is a great place to start if you're new to Cash. You have all his early hits, as well as his later output, including some great covers (U2's One and soundgardens rusty cage). If you like this you can then move on to the prison albums and wherever else takes your fancy. You get a short essay in the booklet and you are told where each song came from so you can find specific albums to go deeper into this great music. well worth a try.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B0041VXGRS|2.0|When I downloaded the sample of this book, I thought it was going to be great. I was so excited about the novel ideas outlined in the sample and in the synopsis. However upon buying the full book, I noticed that there were large sections of text that were copied word for word, many times throughout the book, in what appeared to be an attempt at making the book longer with unnecessary and over-repeated content.     If the common instructions had been listed once and then referred to throughout the rest of the book, (instead of including the whole page and a half in multiple positions and wasting space) I would have felt less cheated.     Overall I enjoyed what content the book had that was not unnecessarily repeated and plan to use some of the ideas, however I would not have paid $9 for this knowing what I know now.

B001ILFUDM|5.0|`Pinocchio' is a childhood favourite of many and one I particularly remember loving as child. It was bought for me recently as a present and I was immediately impressed at the quality of the animation; you tend not to notice these things as a kid! I am usually quite dismissive of Disney films for a variety of reasons but say what you will about them, the early films were exceptional and beautiful. This follows the fairytale of Pinocchio who is a tiny wooden puppet who is brought to life and who has to prove his bravery, honesty and unselfishness before he can be turned into a real boy. Some adventures then follow as he tries to fulfil this goal, with the help of Jiminy Cricket as his conscience. This has some wonderful songs and it is amazing how well these are still known. The part in the film when the boys are turned into donkeys could be deemed scary or mildly disturbing for some children, but I watched this film a lot as a kid and I never remember being upset by this part and loved this film. It is important to remember that we watch this from an adult perspective now and with adult sensibilities and political correctness and sheltering our kids can go too far; kids are more hardy than we give them credit for. This is a good length for most children at just over 80 minutes and it should kept hem spellbound for the duration. Modern animation is very polished and impressive, but there is something organic and real about hand drawn animation that leaves you feeling warm and contented. That may be rose tinted glasses and reminiscing about watching this film as a kid, but it feels right never the less. This disc has various extras on it, from sing along features, to a `making of' documentary but they are mainly aimed towards kids. The whole package has been reworked and spruced up for it's DVD and Blu-Ray release which makes for impressive viewing overall. This is a classic children's film and makes for magical viewing for both kids and adults alike and is well worth watching.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.watching.

B000OPPSX0|5.0|I finished the first disc out of three, and this is a great recording.  First of all, in response to some of the reviewers' opinions about the balance being off, I would say that there is a slight discrepancy between the piano and violin.  The violin is brighter than the piano for sure, but I wouldn't say that it was extreme.  The sound, if just played with a flat line equalizer is a bit dry sounding, although quite clear.  If you have a good stereo, you can probably adjust the your settings to what would be good.    Now, to the performance.  I've review a few other Grumiaux recordings before, and while I admit I am completely biased, this is great interpretation.  Grumiaux is my favorite violinist, and perhaps I take his elegant playing for granted, but I don't think I've ever heard a recording of his I didn't like.  The playing has a very personal approach that I think is unique and really makes Beethoven's music \\"sing\\" (sorry for the pun).      I highly recommend this.
B00190N4E4|5.0|This is a slightly slowed paced, but thoroughly engaging look at the life of Gandhi. It shows how his ideas developed and how revered he was in India and how respected he was by the British. Kingsley is masterly in this role and really makes you believe you are watching Gandhi rather that just a portrayal. The scenery is amazing, as is the direction and although it is a little long, it is a great place to start if you're interested in learning more about this great man.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
044654759X|5.0|Like most of Sparks books, I zipped right through it. This one had some interesting twists and turns.  One of his best.
0440178002|5.0|`Shogun' is quite simply one of the best books I have ever read. From the opening pages I was immediately hooked and I wasn't able to think of anything else until I reached the perfect conclusion. This book is epic, beautiful, full of intrigue, plot twists, machiavellian machinations, tragedy, comedy, honour and a whole range of emotions and feelings I am unable to fully express. It is truly vast and Shakespearean in it's depth of plot and overall scope. This book follows John Blackthorne who is an Elizabethan ship pilot who gets marooned in Japan and who gets embroiled in a war between samurai. He is made samurai and vassal to a Japanese lord and needs to learn about life in Japan quickly as his very life depends on it. There is SO SO much more to the story than that, but it is so densely woven and wonderfully written that it would take an essay to fully do it justice! The author has done exquisite research and the areas of Japanese life covered are rich, varied and authentic. These cover such topics as the tea ceremony, flower arranging, general day to day etiquette and Japanese sensibilities, garden arranging, the wearing of Kimono, the code of Bushido and much more besides. You could learn so much about Japanese life whilst also enjoying this engrossing and enthralling story. You will be fully immersed in the world of the story and I felt truly saddened when I finished the book and wanted to start all over again to keep myself in the time, places and emotions created. You will live and breathe Blackthorne's development with him and feel the confusion and isolation of his early days and the love and honour of his latter days. Some of the cultural differences and misunderstandings (like the willingness and openness to discuss matters of a sexual nature) will make you laugh out loud, the battles, sword fights and ritual suicides will leave your heart pumping and compelled to read on and the romance and moments of passions will make your stomach ache with emotion. This book manages to be historical, an adventure, a political thriller, romance and way more and all in one glorious book. This is an awe inspiring masterpiece and it will leave your life richer for having read it.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.his book manages to be historical, an adventure, a political thriller, romance and way more and all in one glorious book.

B003YK42LQ|5.0|Let me just start out by saying I am a HUGE Kings fan.  I have all 5 albums, know and love (almost) every single song on them.  It's really hard to read all the reviews of disgruntled fans about this album not being like the first couple released.  Get over it.  \\"Come Around Sundown\\" is different and unique, just like every other KOL album.  Yes, it's softer, or should I say, not as \\"gritty\\".  This album is my SECOND favorite from the Kings, with \\"Youth and Young Manhood\\" being my definite number one.      I will admit when first listening to this I thought it was going to be more like \\"Only by the Night\\".  But I was happily proven wrong.  After listening to a few times, I found myself getting certain lyrics that had stuck in my head and how great the lyrics are.  Each song has something special about it and that's what I love about this album.  I want to keep listening to each song over and over again to find out what the story is and what the lyrics could refer to.  Some of my personal favorites are Pyro, Mi Amigo, Birthday, Pickup Truck, Pony Up, Mary, and Back Down South.  That's 7 songs right there that I believe are strong.  Like it or not this is a different album than the rest, but in my opinion they are all different from each other.  The Kings are artists, and an artist never paints the same picture twice.  A TRUE fan will not be disappointed.
B001HPP2X2|5.0|For me personally `Dexter' was one of those slow burner series that gathers pace. Initially I was pretty ambivalent about it and wasn't too fussed when I watched the next episode, but by the fifth episode I was hooked and I watched the remainder of the series in quick succession. Following a blood spatter forensic analyst (Dexter) who investigate murders by day and carries them out by night, the concept it both original and chilling. Dexter is careful to choose his victims very carefully and only murders those most `deserving' because they have gotten away with heinous crimes of their own. This creates the dichotomy of the series where you are left rooting for the `bad' guy. Michael C Hall is as amazing as ever and his detached portrayal of Dexter's emotions makes you appreciate the latent psychotic aspect of his character that is revealed (and nurtured by his foster father) throughout the series. The series has a common storyline throughout, hunting the ice truck killer, as well as individual stories for each episode where Dexter kills his own victims. Overall the acting is excellent from all involved, apart from the actor who plays Dokes who comes across as overly gung ho and the archetype `macho' cop and the actress who plays Deb, Dexter's sister, who is wooden and has terrible dialogue delivery. The finale is brilliant and had me on the edge of my seat throughout and it had some great twists that were excellent pay off for watching the complete series (no cop outs here!). If you don't mind some violence and loads of blood, but want some excellent acting and plotlines then this is the series for you.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
1597801585|5.0|Paolo Bacigalupi's \\"The Windup Girl\\" is a biopunk novel, featuring a dystopic future world where biotech corporations battle for power and money.  In this novel, the scene is Thailand, with its government, culture and religion currently controlling the resources that the biotech corporations desire.  Bacigalupi has created, in this novel, a detailed and plausible future, though certainly not a future we would like to have, but all too plausible none the less.  In this future, mankind seems to be locked in an eternal fight to save itself from the damage it has caused the planet.    In Bacigalupi's dark vision of the future, the biotech companies, or calorie companies as they are called, control the food production and use their power and influence to try to force politicians and agencies to do their bidding.  One of these companies is AgriGen, and its representative is Anderson Lake, one of the key characters of the novel.  Lake is in charge of a factory, but that is a cover for his real mission, which is to gain access to the Thai seedbank.  Another key character is the title character, i.e. The Windup Girl, who is known by the name Emiko.  She is one of those beings referred to as \\"New People\\" that were developed by the Japanese, in her case for sex.    The Thai society is also a key element in this story, as the politics surrounding the current child monarch queen shape everything that occurs in the story.  There are the Trade Ministry and the Environment Ministry battling for power, and groups like the White Shirts who are a constant threat to anyone and anything which is perceived to be a corrupting foreign influence is a potential target for them.  There are also the Green Headbands who never make an appearance in the novel, but who are referred to.  Paolo Bacigalupi also provides some understanding of the rest of the world of the 23rd Century and how his Thailand fits into it, is influenced by it, and fights against its influence.    I certainly cannot do justice to the intricate plot of the story, or attempt to cover all its many plots and subplots in a review, but Anderson Lake's infatuation with Emiko and the effects from his interactions with her is the catalyst for much of what happens in this novel.  While there is a lot to take in from the start of the book, the reader will pick up on the terms used in the novel, such as blister rust, Yellow cards, etc. fairly quickly, and be engrossed in the story as well.  Lastly, but far from least, are the characters.  Far beyond the two I have mentioned, this novel is filled with distinct characters who are multi-dimensioned and believable because they suffer from the same flaws and motivations that people do today.    This novel tied in winning the 2010 Hugo, won the 2010 Nebula, and the Campbell Memorial award.  It also placed 15th on the 2010 Locus awards for SF Novels, and won the 2010 Locus award for first novel, also winning the 2010 Compton Crook / Stephen Tall Memorial award and finished 2nd on the SF Site Readers' Poll.  Even Time named it one of the best novels of the year.  \\"The Windup Girl\\" is a tremendous work, and one can only hope that Bacigalupi continues to develop stories like this for the future he has created.  If you don't like biopunk/cyberpunk, then perhaps this isn't a book you would enjoy, but on the other hand, this may be a good book to give the genre another chance.
B0002S947K|5.0|If you like your music laid back and slightly folky, then this is for you. Ray's voice is very chilled to listen to and the songs are great to relax with. The title track is especially good, as is 'All the wild horses' which ends the album on a beautiful note. There is a lot of hype around this artist, a great deal of which is justified.

0307346617|2.0|I have pretty low standards when it comes to zombie books, but I think this book dipped below that standard by a bit.  This book is organized into chapters that are little summaries of this or that event.  There is really cool zombie stuff in each, but it's not pitched in a compelling storyline...just the sort of text that a government agency would commission.  I understand that that's the whole point of the book, and that it's trying to be literary.  All I'm saying is that if you like a novel with a gradual creeping up a tension, this is not going to be satisfying.  You'll end up skipping the 2-3 pages of character development in each chapter that have nothing, absolutely nothing, to do with the zombie theme.
B000777J2S|5.0|`I Am A Bird Now' is one of those albums you will be delighted to have found. It is moving, eloquent, beautiful, soulful and most important of all, unique. The lead singer has a wonderful voice that was immediately reminiscent of Nina Simone and from the album opener `Hope There's Someone' you know you are in for a very special album. It is safe to say that the standard of song-writing on offer is extremely high and there is honestly not a bad song on this album, which is only just over 35 minutes long, but perfectly crafted in every way. My favourite track has to be `Fistful of Love' which has a great soul feel to it and the combination of vocals and horns makes for a magical song indeed. There are numerous collaborations on this album but it still manages to retain it's own identity which only enhances it overall and with artists like Boy George and Lou Reed the calibre is high indeed. This album will not fail to provoke a reaction within you and it left me profoundly moved and desperate to play it over and over. One of my best finds of recent months and you will be glad to let it into your life. It deserves all the praise it gets and more.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|I purchased this as a gift for my father for Christmas.  He just got a new blu-ray player.  We watched it that day on Christmas.  It's visually stunning, and gives an in depth view of mother nature at her finest!   The narration is fantastic-- much better than the Oprah version.  I highly reccommend it to anyone that loves nature, animals, science, etc.  My dad loved it too!
B000001FY9|5.0|The title of this album says it all. This is such a great collection of songs I don't know where to start. If you're new to Marley then you can't do better than this album, and if you're already a fan then this a great collection of his stuff in one place. Worth it for 'No woman no cry' alone! Brilliant summer music, or any time of the year it's that good!<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B003L77GGK|4.0|After watching this last season I was unsure as to what the writers were going to do?Also if this series was going to make it to a new season?Well in both cases it's good news,first about season 6.I was really interested in the way this season got started.How Dean was living with a life that down deep inside he wanted,a life with a women at his side an a young boy that Dean loved.So \\"never say never,as Dean's brother Sam shows up from the Dead?And so it begins the Winchester's Boys are back together again to hunt the strange things of the night.But something isn't right as the series unfolds,Dean is thruster into a situation where it's not only his brother,but his so call dead grandfather is back an leader of the Campbell's family hunters ?Now things are really looking stranger?Now Dean really isn't sure what to do,stay with his new life with women an son and give up living the hunters life,or stay with his new found family of brother Sam and the Campbell's?It not a debate,when Dean finds out that some Jines are pursuing him,he's brought back to the life in a spit second,as his women and boy are in danger.Dean rushes head first into the hands of the Jines?This goes without saying one of the best episode I've watched,and this opened the rest of the 6th season to all kinds of dangerous beings some we have seen before an new ones?The only thing I can say as to the whole 6th season is three episode are not as good as I would have liked.but I am looking forward to this January 28th @9:00pm on Channel 11 when the new season started.I always loved this series,and hope that it can go on to be even greater.
B0000DZTIW|5.0|One of the standout features of `The Last Samurai' for me was the soundtrack and on listening to this again recently I remember why. It has richly emotive and wonderful orchestral pieces with a Japanese influence. Some of Hans Zimmers's scores can sound very similar, but I am delighted to say that this has a feel all of it's own and stands up as a piece of music in it's own right. You could easily enjoy this having not seen the film and it is a coherent piece from start to finish. There is a definitive musical theme that runs throughout the album which manages to tie everything together and give it an over-arcing narrative. I find this album very relaxing to listen to (apart from a brief Samurai shouting section which always jolts me out of my reverie) and enjoy nothing more than reading a good book with this playing in the background. This is well composed and provides accessible classical music for those new to the genre, as well as offering up a great orchestral score for those fans of film soundtracks.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B00433TO52|3.0|I'm relatively new to the world of Kindle, and the thought of keeping all of Shakespeare in my purse seemed really, really cool!

B0035J6TAI|4.0|`Scratch My Back' is Peter Gabriel's new orchestral covers album and it has a very gentle, introspective pace to it. The theory is that he covers various artists work and they will return the favour to offer us another album of Gabriel covers later on. He has also deliberately chosen to forego the use of drums and guitar, the theory being that these self imposed restrictions will encourage creativity overall as they are worked around. To be honest the album opener `Heroes' left me pretty cold and although I enjoy the original `The Boy in The Bubble', the version on offer here doesn't do it full justice. It isn't until the 4th, 5th and 6th tracks that this album comes into its own and `Flume', `Listening Wind' and `The Power of the Heart' all offer up some moving piano and orchestral playing, accompanied by Gabriel's own unique, almost fragile vocals. In fact, his vocals suit this raw, pared back style of music perfectly. This album has got a slight melancholy feel to it throughout and if you are a fan of his previous work then this may be lacking in a certain passion at times. But taken on face value, and with repeated listening, this album offers up some inspired reworking of other artists tracks and although it has been a long time in the making (Gabriel is renowned now for his long gestation periods between albums) it is still a credible addition to his catalogue of music. I do, however, have to agree with other reviewers who hanker for the delights of `Up' and hope this will be forthcoming soon. This special edition CD has an additional disc with four extra tracks on it, three from the album that are remixed and `Waterloo Sunset'. Although they are good, they are very similar to the album versions and you don't get much more for your money and this isn't the best value special edition I have ever come across. But for big fans of Peter Gabriel that want to experience all his latest album has to offer it goes without saying you should buy this.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.ck out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

B001PA0FF4|4.0|`Doubt' is an outstanding film with exemplary performances from both Meryl Streep and Phillip Seymour Hoffman. They both lift this film from being standard fare to being something great and with gravitas. Hoffman is a progressive priest and Streep is a puritanical nun who is desperate to see any bad in him so that she can hound him out of the church school and maintain her austere status quo. She then starts to have suspicions of inappropriate behaviour with the children, which in reality may just be an informal personality and a man in touch with his gentler side, and yet she is so certain of her suspicions that you are left doubting his behaviour by the end as well. The direction and acting is excellent and although the story could have been resolved more fully, it gave you enough to become fully involved in the plot. In fact, it may have deliberately left the ending slightly ambiguous so that you feel the doubt that other characters also feel and if that was the intention it was a masterly cinematic trick. This has top performances from the main cast and an engaging plot and is well worth watching at some point. Even for those of us who are fatigued with seeing yet another catholic scandal film, this is so well portrayed that it is worth viewing anyway.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|This was a very funny and thus a fun movie to watch. Mary-Louise Parker and the duct tape scene was priceless. I can't wait to see this one again and again as the cast did a great job and made a very funny, fun entertaining film. A+
B000F0UV0E|5.0|This is another great album from Knopfler. His guitar playing is as inspiring as ever and the blend of his and Emmylou's voice is just superb. This has some amazing tracks, 'This is us' being a particular favourite. He kept this project very quiet, which only added to the joy when it was released, with such a high level of songwriting and playing. As another reviewer mentioned, Knopfler seems to be at the top of his game at the moment and this album only serves to confirm that.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

B000V86OKG|5.0|If you enjoyed the first series of `Dexter' then you are in for a real treat with the second. Following on from where the last series left off this still has Dexter killing off those murderers who have gotten away with their crimes, but where as in the first series the underlying story was the Ice Truck Killer, in this series it is the hunt for Dexter himself (dubbed the Bay Harbour Butcher) that keeps us engrossed and on the edge of our seats. There is so much tension from this story alone that after watching a couple of episodes you will want to keep watching and watching 'just one more episode' until you reach the end of the series. I could not stop watching this until I reached the shattering conclusion and this is as good as, if not better than, the first series. My reservations about the initial series, I.e. the poor acting from both the actors playing Deb and Doakes, is not an issue this time round and they both play their parts perfectly. My only gripe this time is the character called Lila, who's sounds like she has a terrible 'put on' British accent despite this being her actual accent, and it drives me mad whenever she is on the screen. There are so many twists and turns that you are kept guessing throughout about how various storylines will unfold and each plot avenue is eventually tied up expertly and leaves you satisfied. It is hard to mention each plot aspect without spoiling the ending, but believe me this is well worth watching if you are a fan of the first series and it will leave you desperately awaiting the third. There is a 5th disc of extras which include cast interviews, stills from the series, trivia, features on the title music, Harry's Code, Dexter's Knives and more besides. These really add to the overall package and give a deeper insight into the series. Overall this has more great acting, storylines and intrigue that the series' are becoming renowned for and makes for captivating and addictive viewing. Well worth checking out.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.ee to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

0199235694|5.0|I have read numerous `Very Short Introduction...' books and some have been as dry as a mouth full of crackers in a desert, but thankfully `Modern Japan' isn't one of those books and kept me interested and engaged throughout. This looks at the period of history from the early 1800's until the present day and Japans development as a modern nation. It goes to great lengths to distinguish if being modern equates to being westernised and explores whether Japan can be modern (or even postmodern) whilst retaining it's inherent eastern spirit and identity. This looks at the demise of the Samurai and lords, the growth of a central government, Japans imperial exploits, WW2 and it's aftermath and Japans post war economic resurgence. Each chapter is clear and lucid and makes its point eloquently, backed up with various sources. There are also assorted illustrations and maps doted throughout which add to the text. This is a brief and informative look through Japans recent history and I found it thoroughly engaging and fascinating throughout. If you have even a passing interest in Japan then this is worth a look at some point.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B0007PALZ2|5.0|This is one of the BEST movie's Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt have ever done. The crazy scenes are so realistic. This movie does alot of switching back and forth, and you must pay attention to the whole movie to keep up. But they cleverly entwine all scenes into one masterpiece. Definitly worth adding to your collection..A+++++++++++++
B0037KMHRY|5.0|When I saw the movie, the score was definitely the second most noticeable element, behind the visual effects. There's no shortage of reasons to enjoy this album.    If you like Daft Punk, you'll like this album, because it's some of the best of what they do. If you liked the movie, you'll like this album, because as with any score, you can close your eyes and find yourself in the middle of a particularly memorable scene, just by listening to the music. If you liked the 1980s, this--well, I'll put it the way I put it when a friend asked me about it: It's like the 1980s, as a whole, had indecent relations with the London Symphony Orchestra, and it was glorious.    While some scores rely on a variety of themes and recurring melodies to produce a varied effect, the score for Tron Legacy has perhaps three recurring melodies at most, and a trained ear can pick them out in an instant. However, Daft Punk did something far more interesting, which I believe provides another reason to give this album at least a once-over. Every time a theme is revisited, one can hear a change in the very texture of the sound, lending more depth than a simple change in pace or key can do on its own.    tl;dr: A very unique soundtrack. If you like Daft Punk, Tron or electronic music in general, give this a go.
015206396X|3.0|Firstly, I don't hate this book. I don't even dislike this book. It's just...okay. Some of the concepts and ideas were cool, and even some of the characters were cool. The romance was done well enough to satisfy me. The plot was okay, and the author proved herself to be adept at eluding toward certain things (such as sex and abuse) without them smacking you in the face or being overly explicit.    However, much of the humor felt forced. At times it felt like the main character (Katsa, not to be confused with Katniss) didn't know what she wanted and did things just...because. And at the end, none of her problems were really resolved. The evil king was still on the throne, and Katsa showed no inclination to changing or actively opposing him, instead choosing her love interest.     Overall? I've read better, but I've certainly read worse. I'll definitely continue reading, though, just to see if there's any improvement or new ideas.
0061564893|5.0|Excellent book and the the basis of his novel seems very plausible and believable. Will read his other novels because he is quite a dynamic writer.
044654759X|3.0|I had just gotten my Kindle and was looking for books to download.  I had liked some of Nicholas Sparks books so I made this book one of my first purchases.  It was OK. I have read many books with the same story line.  Abused wife runs away and meets the man of her dreams.  There were a few different touches but still the story line was predictable.  I don't want to write about the different touches as not to give it away if you decide to purchase this book.
0307454541|1.0|Spoiler but will end up saving you several hours of your life. This book is extremely long and drawn out full of useless information. It gives you a complete almost biblical history for a third of the book which in the end is basically useless. It is one of those unsolvable mysteries that ends up being someone never mentioned before with no coherent way of solving it yourself. It could have been a good story but really i think the author just ran out of creative ideas and just decided to end it with a hit into left field.
0143036424|4.0|i read the cold dish and enjoyed it very much.  I did find it started off rather slow but then it got intriging and I couldn't wait to finish it.    I did find it rather interesting as I was raised in Wyoming and now live in Montana.  He incorporated both states into his story as it mainly all took place in Wyoming.  For someone not being around this area they wouldn't know the difference.  I am anxiously awaiting to get another book written by Craig.

B000AM2L1O|5.0|This baby doll is so perfect. She is so pretty and soft. My 18 month old loves her. She carries her around kissing her and snuggling her all day. Perfect size for little hands, and the beans in the body make her that much more real!
0439023513|3.0|I've been hijacked. There's no question to it. I am blinded with opinions that I will share. One thing, though, I won't give a whole summary of the book, but you'll see this: *ALERT* whenever I'll give something away. Don't say I didn't warn you.:)  ~The ending. I finished the book, closed it, walked upstairs, and went along with my life as though I hadn't just finished a book as deep as Mockingjay. Then, the emotions came. I fought to stay stoic, but you can't fight a rush of tears. I am not Katniss, no matter how hard I try. *ALERT* I thought, not Prim! Not Finnick! It's not fair! Could Collins have ended the book wrapped up in a neat little bow, with Katniss skipping off into the sunset? No, she couldn't, because a. Katniss would be caught dead skipping, and b. she just fought in a war, and she's only 17! And she's on her own with a wack-job mentor (sorry Haymitch). The book was about WAR! That isn't resolved over night! But still, I disliked the ending. All Katniss does is mope around, and scream for Peeta when things get hard. Yes, yes, I know she just fought for her life and her sister and mother are gone, and there are stages of grief, I get all that. But it felt...incomplete. *Alert* Here's a bomb, dead Prim, dead Coin, Snow choking and dot dot dotting, back to 12, goodbye. Like, okay, now what? The book didn't feel resolved. The denoument was weak, and it was black and dreary. I wanted SOMETHING to go right for Katniss, but life ain't always easy in her world. Katniss had a hard life, first her father, then the Quarter Quell, then Prim. Ms. Collins, you could have added one ray of sunshine to Katniss's world, but now that I think about it, she did. Her children. But even that felt sad, because her kids played on a graveyard. No more Hunger Games, but Katniss will always have a scar, internal, and probably external because she was nearly scorched to death. Katniss annoyingly just hid in a corner or took a shower until she felt ready to face the world again.But she's never truly ready. She will always be sad and mopey until another ray of sunshine comes to her world. A fourth book wouldn't do it, but Collins had the power and didn't use it, and now Katniss is haunted by fluffy snow, and the stench of genetically-enhanced roses.    ~Gale or Peeta? I was so sure in the beginning Gale would be the one, but was I wrong, or was I wrong? Gale just seemed so right for her. Peeta just seemed like another boy from a classic story about the boy next door. Gale was always there for her, and he deserted her by going to find a job and comepletely forgot about that one day...*Sigh* Men. But Peeta never loved Katniss like Gale did. Gale said he should have volunteered to take Peeta's place to protect Katniss, and Peeta's love was just a story to survive. It should have been Gale. Really.    Mockingjay didn't ruin the series for me, it was just the ending that made me pace around, thinking about things in my head, like a game.  \\"But there are much worse games to play.\\"
B004E9UB8O|4.0|I was a little leary ordering this book, 1) because of the whole vampire thing and 2) because I couldn't really see how a knitting pattern book could be good on Kindle, although I am have truly been wishing that pattern books would be available for my kindle.  Surprisingly, this book really is great! I won't make every project in the book, but I will definitely make the sweater on the cover and probably the mittens and hat, too.  It is VERY readable on my Kindle and the more difficult pattern charts are actually available for download and printing, which I find to be an awesome feature.  The only thing I wish I could have viewed prior to purchase are pages of the paperback to get a better idea of what the patterns were before paying $9.99.  Luckily, I still would have bought the book even if I didn't like all of the patterns because there are plenty in the book that I do like.  I hope more publishers/authors follow suit and make more pattern books available for Kindle. Now I am off to my local yarn store, Soft and Sassy, to buy the yarn to start making the sweater shown on the cover!

0199536481|2.0|I found this novel hard to review, not that it was boring but it is around 230 years old and can be seen from many angles. In 1782 the American states and England were just getting ready to settle the revolution, the American continent was being settled by immigtants from many different countries and all had different moral standards. \\"Dangerous Liaisons\\" used the French nobility and French standards. Duels were fought, in the U. S.; Burr-Hamilton had yet to occur so how do we view the duel in the novel? Also, bundling was common in the U. S., with concomitant sexual foreplay and led to intercourse even before the revolution. Why all this fuss in the novel? Also there is the question of frigidity and sexual desire, even today among the Africans clitoral removal is practised because the women are regarded as sexually active unless desire and pleasure are reduced, more so than the males. Indiana University had, or has, a sex study that prints books on their findings and frigidity is attributed to women which contradicts other beliefs at other times, during the protestsnt reformation women were considered more sexually active than the males, and even earlier the Egyptians and either the Greeks or Romans expected the females to be the sexual predators, the men more timid and complacent.  All this is just the beginning of what the novel has to offer, after all it must have something if it lasted to date about 230 years. It is a series of letters, so suspense is almost impossible to attain, just wait for the next letter. Plot is difficult to hold, an excuse must be found in the letters to tell what the author of the letter is doing or plans to do and why. The Comte de Valmont is one of the main letter writers, his conceit as shown in the letters is almost unbelievable and his prowess is unbelievable, he can get a woman to fall in love with him in a couple of days merely by telling her he loves her and reiterating it continually in his letters to her until she falls for it, for some reason no woman refuses to listen to him. He is even better than Cyrano de Bergerac, he has no deformities and can present himself in person and thus persuade his heart's desire to love him, her protestations of lack of attraction are disbelieved and de Laclos at first had me believing her but to make his story move, he had to make Monsieur le Comte be correct. This I could not believe but it was crammed down my throat and I hated M. le Comte henceforth. La Marquise de Merteuil is shown to be more cunning than M. le Comte and she has Valmont tied around her finger without his knowing it, she plays him as skilfully as he plays la Presidente de Tourvel. Laclos is good in writing narrative around both le Comte and la Marquise and letting us see their tricks, the other characters in the book want to believe what they hear and consequently swallow the lies of these two schemers. Retribution strikes  but are we satisfied? To me it is too obvious, the threat is made apparent then it occurs. Of course we have had 230 years to get our fill of such desired outcomes.
B0039Q7QKE|5.0|It's perfect. It looks and feels exactly like the one in the movie; and it IS metal, not painted plastic. Even the case looks like it was really issued from Starfleet. I'm very very happy with it and you won't be dissappointed either.

0064407667|5.0|The Bad Beginning is the first installment of the slightly morbid chronicles of the Baudelaire children.  Lemony Snicket skillfully uses a refreshingly frank and humorous tone to guide readers through the chronic tragedies that these children face.  The recently orphaned Baudelaire siblings find themselves in need of a guardian.  They are placed in the hands of the unknown Count Olaf.  Regrettably, Count Olaf soon makes it clear that he is after the children's immense fortune.  Violet (the inventor), Klaus (the lover of books) and Sunny (the biter) must find a way to safeguard their fortune and keep their lives intact, all while struggling with the loss of their parents.  This first book in A Series of Unfortunate Events encourages a true love of reading as a source of entertainment and solace, but also as a means to provide solutions for sticky situations.  Without painting adults as incompetent, it shows the Baudelaires using their individual talents to problem-solve.  The Bad Beginning is at a good level for fifth and sixth graders.  I would caution that the somewhat grim subject matter of this series might be frightening to some.  However, I would strongly recommend this book to sixth and seventh graders with learning disabilities.  Snicket sprinkles definitions of words and phrases that might be unfamiliar throughout the story in a natural way that does not assume the reader's ignorance.  Short chapters make this book perfect for struggling readers.  Those who have social deficits would also interact well with this book as it points out information that they might not have naturally picked up on.  For example, the fact that toddlers, like Sunny, use their mouths as a way to gather information about the world around them might be new information to this type of reader.
B0040T7B2W|5.0|I guess I am still getting used to this CD as a whole. It's like I have heard it before and most songs sound like that one (from previous cds) I always wanted to finish fast so I could hear the next one. Why did I rate it five stars then? Simply because I can't help playing \\"I want the world to stop\\" over and over again. It's a great song and I am in love with it. It's got that B&S beat I can't seem to get enough of. It reminds me of the \\"good old days\\" when a friend who had just arrived from England showed me a CD and asked: \\"hey, have you heard this? It's called Belle and Sebastian and this one is Like Dylan in the Movies\\", in the late 90's... By the way, I would love to see them performing live. I have the \\"Fans Only\\" dvd and it's perfect.

Come to Brasilia - DF! :)
0385341679|3.0|Let me preface my review by saying I really enjoy Karen Marie Moning's books, and loved her Fever series, and the overall story arc. This just wasn't my favorite.<br /><br />Shadowfever was surprising, and clever at times, but 80% of the book left me waiting for something truly amazing to happen. Perhaps my expectation was the problem. The last 20% of the book makes up for it; the ending is awesome, and I love how she pulls things together. It's a must read if you've been following the series.<br /><br />All questions were answered, but without Moning's usual finesse. I can not say this enough. Normally, she is an eloquent writer, but Shadowfever seemed plain, riddled with cliches. I want books to lure me in, seduce and enchant me, whether they're book one or book five. It felt like the author already had us hooked on her series line, so she just pounded out words to get to the end. It didn't even seem like she tried to make it pretty. Mac's internal dialogue was redundant, and at times a struggle to get through.<br /><br />The eroticism of the male characters, and their effect on Mac was over emphasized, and it seemed silly; in some instances it felt odd and inappropriate for the circumstances. Hot, sensuous males is a Moning trademark, but in some scenes, it just didn't fit. I just saw you die now I have to *&^% you. I get where she's coming from--the male expressing emotion after a traumatizing event-- but it doesn't flow, and to me, comes across as ridiculous, laughable. The picture Mac finds of Darroc is creepy, and there are no words she could throw at it to make it anything else. Oh, and poor Darroc, the Lord Master. The resolution of his storyline is sadly anticlimactic.<br /><br />Finally, we find out what Barrons is. I'm not upset at what he turned out to be, but after the big reveal, he's no longer the classy, barely- contained sexual Barrons we've come to know and love. He's suddenly just a boorish tough guy. The sexual tension just isn't there and that's a sad thing because Moning writes it very well.<br /><br />I was very surprised to learn the mystery behind the sounds in the garage, but even this was fumbled by Barrons pretending to fall for a lie Mac tells him. He smiles his winning smile because the lie makes him realize Mac loves him. What? After all his suffering, a MILLENNIUM of pain and suffering, and suddenly rainbow girl loves him (he's only know her a few months) and all is right with the world? NO. WAY. It would be far more palatable for Barrons to be angry, hurt, disappointed (pick your adjective), and have these feelings force Mac deep within herself in search of a solution to help the man she loves.<br /><br />Moning wanted to create a monster unknown to readers, one that would defy categorization and labels, but Barrons is just an amalgam of all the fiendish horrors without all the brooding and self pity.<br /><br />When done well, I love young adult novels full of raw, coming-of-age emotions, and I enjoy young characters in adult fiction, but Dani, the fourteen-year-old sidhe seer, is simply annoying--no funny snark there. Moning needs to practice writing a YA character that is believable to the reader. Portraying young adults is a completely different animal, and not just an adult projection of what a young adult \\"should be.\\"<br /><br />Shadowfever gets a generous three stars for the few surprise appearances and revelations in the magical denouement of the fever series. It's obvious the author is planning to write more in the fever world but this reader is done, done, done. My curiosity hasn't been piqued quite enough, and I have absolutely no interest in Dani at all. Wait! But what about Christian? Ahh. Never say never.rites it very well.

B00192IV9U|4.0|Michael Jackson said on the last track (\\"Much Too Soon\\") that he is \\"forever.\\" Michael could not have been more right. His music, dancing and legacy will live on forever. He impacted entertainment like no one else. All of his albums from \\"Off the Wall\\" right up to now with \\"Michael\\" are quality works. His most lackluster album is certainly \\"Invincible.\\" I enjoyed \\"Michael.\\" I listened to it more than once and am entertained with every listen. There are just 10 tracks, and I heard that this is because Sony wants to release bits of his new music at a time in order to make more money. Michael Jackson did not like Sony. He said they were \\"evil\\" and \\"the devil.\\" There has been a lot of controversy surrounding this album, too. It has been said that \\"Breaking News\\", \\"Monster\\" and \\"Keep Your Head Up\\" are not Michael Jackson. When I listened to this album, though, I put all criticisms aside and just listened.<br /><br />The album opens with a track that features Akon called \\"Hold My Hand.\\" I never really liked Akon, but he did a fine job in joining forces with Michael. It's a mid-tempo track and the lyrical content is good. I especially like the hook. \\"Hollywood Tonight\\" is another fine track. Michael sounds good, however, this is not classic Michael by any means. \\"Hollywood Tonight\\" and \\"Breaking News\\" sound like they could have been on Michael's \\"HIStory\\" album. When Michael first passed, I heard \\"The Way You Love Me\\" and listened to it over and over because I really enjoyed it. They included this song on \\"Michael\\" and I am glad they did so that the buying public can enjoy is as I did. They altered the instrumentation of \\"The Way You Love Me\\" and I like the other version better, but this version is great, too. Lyrically and musically, \\"Much Too Soon\\" reminds me of \\"She's Out Of My Life.\\" This track is good, but not one of his better ballads. Michael is singing that his lover left him sooner than she should have. It has a melancholy feel to it.<br /><br />When it comes to Michael and his difference with Sony, I do not appreciate what Sony did to him, but I do enjoy Michael's music and look forward to future releases.

B0041VIJQG|3.0|We should want to like this collection of songs. Especially after the evocative and hugely satisfying \\"Raising Sands\\" with Alison Krauss. I'm having a hard time, however, reconciling Mr. Plant's comments at the Grammy's last year where he arrogantly proclaimed his embarrassment of having recorded with T-Bone Burnett and Alison Krauss by saying \\"I guess this is what one calls selling out.\\" Apparently he was so embarrassed that he jettisoned both Ms. Krauss and Mr. Burnett to replicate the commercial success of \\"Raising Sand\\" with the same formula on his own with producer Buddy Miles. OK then. We'll buy into the idea that this is the stuff he was doing before he became \\"the voice\\" of Zep, but I just wish he would do this with a small amount of appreciation to the folks that revived his career. Nonetheless, this is a disc worth owning. Yea, I hate saying it, but \\"the voice\\" is good - real good, on this selection of songs. You'll want to add this to your collection, but add an Alison Krauss disc to your shopping cart before you're done.

B000RZIGVS|1.0|I just received Star Trek, The Next Generation and I haven't begun to watch the series but I will say that if there is even one pixilate in this set I intend to return it to the seller.  I'm on the verge of sending it back anyway due to the packaging which is the worst I've ever encountered.  There aren't words to discribe how horrible the packaging is.  If I keep it I'll have to buy a folder to hold the discs since one can't determine what is even in the slots.  The cases are taped together with scotch tape and most of the cases are plastic and cracked and/or chipped.  I thought the packing for  Babylon 5 was bad but this one takes the cake.  We pay top dollar for these sets and we have the right to receive these items in packaging that is at least acceptable.  I've given this product one star initially based solely on the packaging.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This post-apocalyptic story is packed with action, but what really drives the story are the characters.  They are fully-drawn, realistic and believable.  If you've read or watched a lot of post-apocalyptic stories, the plot will be very familiar.  But it worked for me because I cared about the characters.      I read this on my Kindle 3.  I was disappointed that the chapter breaks are between the parts (there are three), and not between the chapters.  Other than that, there were no formatting, editing or other issues in the Kindle version.

1563899426|3.0|The Fables graphic novel series begins with this volume, Legends in Exile. It manages to incorporate both background story as to who the Fables are and a mystery.<br /><br />The \\"Fables\\" are just that: the characters from legends, fables and fairy tales. Their Homelands were invaded and those that had the means to do so escaped into New York City and upstate New York. These refugees form a small Fable Town community, with King Cole presiding and Snow White as second in command.<br /><br />Jack (of the Tales) discovers his girlfriend Rose Red's trashed and bloody apartment and comes to the one law enforcer of Fable Town, Bigby Wolf (as in The Big Bad). Bigby, with unwanted help from Snow (it's her sister that's missing, after all) questions suspects and unravels the mystery. He delivers the answer in a tongue in cheek, classic mystery \\"parlor room\\" setting.<br /><br />The mystery is interesting and has a good ending. There are some truly witty lines in the dialogue. The characters are generally quite engaging. Bigby is charming in a rough, uncertain way; Snow is arrogant and vulnerable; Bluebeard is appealing and frightening. The twist on their lives and characters is just plain fun fantasy. It's not awe-inspiring, but it is fun.<br /><br />A short story becomes a graphic novel through the addition of good artwork. The art for this is average. Facial expressions are well done and costumes and fantasy elements are clever. Unfortunately, there were no \\"Wow\\" moments, as there are in other graphic novels. The panels don't carry the story forward or add to the story, they are simply illustrations. The one excellent panel was showing Bigby's shadow as a wolf. Other than that. . . well, it felt like any ol' comic book.<br /><br />That said, and despite my average 3 star rating, I became interested enough in Fable Town to want to read more. I just hope that the illustrations become more of a vehicle to tell the story as the series continues.
0865479186|3.0|The attacks on fraudulent and dubious claims about vitamins, drugs, miracle cures, etc., are on target, but they get a little tedious by the end. As a collection of newspaper columns, the book is fine, but the exposition of EBM, meta-analysis, clinical trials, etc., is not especially thorough or memorable.
B004H1YH66|5.0|Conan the Barbarian, Poledouris, and film score fans prepare to rejoice!<br /><br />This new release of the amazing score by the late, great master Basil Poledouris, is simply amazing. I've been listening to the Conan score since I was a kid picking up any version that I could find as they became available. When I saw this release I was skeptical, as many re-recorded film scores can be less than impressive.<br /><br />Well, that is not the case with this release from Prometheus Records. This is a brand new recording of the complete score from the 1982 film Conan the Barbarian. Poledouris crafted his magnum opus with this score (I heard that he worked for an entire year in its creation) and it really shows. The film features so little dialogue that the score actually became another character in the story. While impressive in its initial release there was a lot more music in the film than on the first soundtrack, but the music was so incredible that we just kept listening anyway. In 1992 faithful fans were rewarded with an amazing new release on the Varese Sarabande label; a 16 track CD version that added a whole new level of awesome to the score. But there was always something missing.<br /><br />Now, finally, the complete score has been released! Included are the much needed tracks Pit Fights, The Tower of Set, and In the Court of King Osric to name a few. Also included are the special treats like the alternate version of Theology/Civilization and a wonderful rendering from Conan the Destroyer \\"Chamber of Mirrors\\". I was not aware that this project was in the works but apparently Basil was involved in starting this project some 15 years ago. Sadly, he did not live to see it to completion, but thankfully James Fitzpatrick saw to it that the project was completed. Let me say that the only disappointing thing about this release is the cheezy artwork; it is a shame that they didn't use the amazing art of R. Cassaro on the CD. This doesn't have to replace the original score in your collection. I like to think that it complements it.<br /><br />I should preface this glowing review: the original recording of the Conan score, the one that was forged in Rome by Basil himself (intentional Father's sword reference), will always hold a special place in my heart. It has always been my favorite music to listen to as long as I can remember. There is unmatched passion and emotion in that recording (that will hopefully get a remastering someday) that cannot be equaled. However this new release is a glorious version of the Conan score that really opens up with modern recording techniques being employed.  Listening to it gives me goosebumps and has also brought me to tears. That's how special this music is.<br /><br />So do whatever you can to get this 2 disc version of the Conan score and you will also see what a great prize this is. I believe that it is very possible that in 100 years or 500 years that this music will be regarded with the same admiration that the music of Beethoven and Mozart is today.<br /><br />______________________________________<br />Update: 8-22-12<br /><br />Having now lived with this new version of our beloved Conan score I must change my review. I've left the above review for honesty but I now view this recording differently. My new take on this recording is very similar to that of F. Dean. The original recording just has so much more heart and emotion in it. Some of the changes in this new recording are interesting but most are unwelcome and not needed. Including the ghastly, blaring tubas near the climax of Orphans of Doom/Awakening. There is a 5 note descending melody played in the buildup. In the original recording the 5th note is very subdued, but in this new version it is blasted out and honestly sounds like a wrong note. What the heck is that all about? Funny though, because they sound like \\"orphaned\\" notes! I am glad that classic score is getting some new attention thrown at it though. It really deserves it.<br /><br />Despite the flaws of the original recording it is still the most outstanding film score ever recorded in my opinion. The new version is much like hearing a symphony perform one of your favorite classical pieces; it is fun to listen to, even wonderful at times, but I always find myself going back to the original (Var&egrave;se Sarabande) recording. Kind of like the way you become attached to a certain performance of a piece of music. It may not be the most flawless version but there is great emotion tied to music.<br /><br />The version we've lived with all these years is Poledouris' magnum opus, composed and created in his fiery prime. Another way to look at this music is that the original score was recorded with a certain energy and pressure only a film production schedule can produce. The choir & orchestra may not have been the caliber of the London Symphony but the music they played blended perfectly with the movie. It's almost as if this group of players came together to produce the original Conan score and then they vanished from the earth (much like the Cinematic power of the Conan film saga) as they too were part of the magic that was \\"Conan the Barbarian\\"; raw, emotional, and visceral.br /><br />Despite the flaws of the original recording it is still the most outstanding film score ever recorded in my opinion.

B002ZG980U|2.0|I'm not going to comment here on the filmic aspects of the movie but my basic moral repulsion to this movie, especially the ending.  Hardly is the watcher made to feel throughout the movie that Cobb is a reckless and foolhardy madman of the likes of Ahab; at the end, when everybody has been kicked back to reality (on the airplane), there is a sense in which Cobb is in awe of his deed and his cohorts look to him with the same, even admiration, but this isn't even the icing on the cake, it's the wholesome homecoming as he meets his father at the airport--this tapping of others' subconscious is after all, the family business--and is promptly taken to his home where he finally sees the happy faces of his children.  The reunion with his children is not only the fruit of deceiving his wife primarily and secondarily his colleagues (to achieve the mission) but also the successful corporate cum mental espionage of a job well done.  Cobb's character's rotten core is attenuated by Fischer finally realizing he should be his own man and Cobb exorcising his dream demons, so to speak, in a kind of feel good resolution with a trippy plot hook.  It's not clear to me what is worse, that these moral considerations were obviously irrelevant to Hollywood or the viewing public.
1594202842|1.0|Do not buy this book.  I'll define myself as  a WASP whose family arrived with Wm Penn. suddenly nationality seems to matter?  My daughters are successful... one is a candidate for a Ph d. in Organic and Physical Chemistry.  The other just had a perfect score on her nursing test. (Our family allows no lawyers.)  When I read the review in the Wall Street Journal  1/8/11 I was impatient  to read the BHTM. For I too allowed no sleepovers, choice of violin or piano, no video games, no TV and private school with tutors.  So I was intrigued. To my shock... the book was written by an unctuous mother, who had none of the values that I consider American. Even though my girls are successful, they continue to perform community service and respect others who are not as fortunate. Our daughters were not excused from cleaning apartments, digging ditches or homework. Why would playing at Carnegie Hall be so important? . Why would one be that type of model for their children?  Suddenly at 26 my sister died.   My parents loved her so much?  Each day our family treats each other like this may be their last day.  The book was a great disappointment - not about a mother's love.  Do not buy this book.

With this you can say goodbye to all those boring animal documentaries in low definition and with a mediocre sight of animals, because this documentary turns them to LIFE...
0060005696|2.0|One reviewer \\"ascii3hex\\" said did a great job summarizing the authors main point:     \\"It takes extra energy and thought to choose from among the dizzying array of choices that surround us; but that effort doesn't yield a corresponding increase in satisfaction with our choice and often yields _less_ satisfaction than if we had made a decision faster. That's it.\\"      Thank you for a great summary!  Problem is, if that IS the books assumption, I find it to be a flawed assumption that is flat wrong in many cases.      According to this author then, I ought not to be reading reviews, much less writing this review right now (and I thought critical  thinking was a good trait).  Chew on that for a second....if you are a frequenter of amazon reviews every now and again then you are apparently doing it all wrong.  Gasp*#!%*.  Well, I do often read amazon and other reviews of books and products I hear about, before buying them.  After taking in a few reviews, I make a choice whether to actually read the book or not.  Many times reading reviews before buying a product has saved me from buying an obvious lemon.  Is it extra work?  Yes, but I don't feel the need to complain about it, because for one, it is MY CHOICE to do so, and for two is often REWARDING.       If I did as the author suggested, I would have already ordered his book and not wasted my time making the decision.  I personally think that more information is good, so while I can understand where he is coming from, it just doesn't ring true for me.  In just about all of the decisions I make, the effort DOES LEAD TO A HIGHER LEVEL OF SATISFACTION.  Thats why I do it, duh!  I know, for ex if I just walk over to wal mart and buy a piece of junk, most likely it's gonna last less than a year, will wind up wasting our Earth's precious raw materials, I'll have to toss it out, and then I'm right back where I started.  I would call that the lazy mans approach actually.     Do I go buy another one from Wal Mart again?  NO, already tried that and look where it got me!!!  But if not that , what else? Who will figure out for me my other options?  Oh no, what ever will I do?  I'm feeling depressed and overwhelmed.  Sorry, I'm being overdramatic, but I find it hard to take this premise seriously especially when there are far more pressing issues in the world to write books about like what contribution can we make to help people who do not have enough food to eat in Asia and Africa?  I get the sense that the author is feeling sorry for himself, but to be mad about true choice is not healthy.  I do not blame the author for his choice to write the book, but by his own logic, the extra choice of what to read would actually create more maximizers.      More choice is better, and yes it requires a small investment of time.  I've learned from experience that it's better to invest the time at the getgo and not always be buying stuff that breaks right away like I used to.  Does it take a bit more effort, yeah, but not very much at all.  Does it payoff to do it?  Well, yes, when the chairs I buy last 25 years and then can be repaired down the line if and when they break...think how many decisions, trips to the store, and money I saved.  I don't want to buy and throw away!    There are so many areas where more info is better - take food labeling for example.  I personally read labels, and am happy to know what ingredients I am putting in my own body and my family's.  I believe we are lucky to understand nutrition and have the choice to not eat the various chemicals now in processed foods if we would rather not.  Does the author think its best just to grab something off the shelf and not read the description?  Well, probably not, but as you can see his thesis is not holding up, it is quickly sinking under deeper analysis.        Back to book reviews.  Is it better to spend a half hour finding the right book and then enjoying 90% of the books you read (hundreds of hours), or just quickly grabbing a bookin five minutes when you feel like reading and then enjoying 20% of the books (again, many hours)?  I would rather spend the time out front and be happy with my decision.  If I'm NOT happy with my decision, chances are I did not spend enough time researching or did not know the right place to look.  That has been true in my life whether we're talking about books, jeans, or what kind of windows to get in my new house.   Granted, way more time would be spent on windows than on jeans, but my point is - there can be no way that less TRUE choices (not same product different marketing/packaging) is better.  Is consumer reports garbage?  Why is it wrong to want to like the products you buy and have them last?  I am not advocating spending hours being paralyzed over a toothpaste choice, but then again, maybe it would be good to educate yourself and your family on the benefits pros cons of whether fluoride is needed or not (there is currently a fierce debate in the medical community what level of fluride is hurtful) or sodium laurl sulfate (a foaming agent in many toothpastes which causes canker sours / cold sours).      I like choice and I have no problem making them.           PLUS, I ENJOY READING REVIEWS AND TAKING IN THE VARIOUS THOUGHTS AND IDEAS : )  WHERE IS THAT FACTORED INTO THE MODEL?     Bottom line - yes you can spend too much energy on certain choices, but at the same time the exact opposite scenario is just as likely to have a negative effect **if not moreso** because when the product turns out to be not what you wanted or breaks right away then you are back to square one.  If the author really wants a certain style of jeans made to a specific fit, and he can't find them, then he either didn't look hard enough or has not exhausted his options - which include contacting the manufacturer, going to a local tailor (as classy folks used to regularly), or even learn to sew himself.

0375851569|5.0|These books are just as good as I remembered them, and am happy to share them with my daughter!  Additionally, the quality of the binding, paperstock, and cover are excellent and built to last.
0547258305|3.0|While I enjoyed Graceling, I didn't love it.  The best part about the book was the characters.  Katsa and Po both face internal struggles of self-doubt and both have become used to hiding parts of themselves away from others.  Their strong emotional connection and the questions it raised for each of them were compelling.  The development of their relationship from mysterious meeting to hidden secrets and beyond was more interesting than the actual story of the journey they were taking.<br /><br />I found the world in Graceling to be fairly generic.  Little is known about the inhabitants of the seven kingdoms beyond general descriptions of the kings in each.  The setting is not described in much detail either except when it is a barrier to survival.  The actual plot of the story didn't hold my attention until Katsa and Po met Bitterblue and then it was more the addition of another interesting character that caught me instead of the actual story.  In some ways the action seemed to resolve itself too quickly because the solution just appeared or the character just suddenly managed to do what needed to be done.
B0000AM6LY|5.0|Simply Red is at it's best with \\"Home\\". This collection of songs is great, and I had been planning to purchase it for quite awhile. My favorites are  \\"Sunrise\\" and the cover of \\"You Make Me Feel Brand New.\\" The goodness is not limited to just those songs, however. Mick's voice is super smooth on many of the tracks.     A worthy purchase!
030745455X|5.0|Yet again I was pulled in and couldn't put this book down. I can't wait to read the third since the ending left you hanging. Must read!!! I was surprised that I was still hooked even though Lisbeth was in hiding and we didn't hear much from her through a lot of the book. Loved it!
B003JSSPSY|5.0|Legend of the Seeker is a great show. It may not follow the books very closely, but it instead owes a lot of visual cues from Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings movies, and does a great job of both serializing the monolithic Wizard's First Rule stories into a much more episodic, much more character-driven, very compelling television show.    Definitely worth watching if you like fantasy, will be more enjoyable if you're expecting (and can accept) it to depart from the book series.
0307454541|5.0|Definitely worth reading. I do admit I was a little confused at the beginning but then a few chapters in and I was hooked. Everything came together and it was amazing! It will pull you in and you won't want to put it down.
0439023521|5.0|I have now read 2 of the three novels in this series and can't wait to read the last one \\"Mockingjay\\".  I normally don't read series books but Hunger Games was so good that I couldn't wait for more. Easy to read with surprises at every turn.  I fell instantly in love with the characters and felt connected even though the time is futuristic. Even if you don't read the second and third novels, Hunger Games is one to add to your list!
B003F3NDWG|5.0|Castle continues to be great fun--and somehow making one more confident about police. I work with novelists and law enforcement. Although there are a few exceptions,most are normally not as good looking as Castle and Beckett. However the writers have done a good job with the personalities of all characters. Not sure I would like this if it were a book, but really works as a TV series for me.
B003R0MF1M|5.0|WOW!! That's what I have to say about this amazing series! I had no clue it would run 7 seasons due to being slapped around by NBC for its first 5 years. It premiered back in January 2005 as a mid-season replacement and its first 16 episodes were simply astonishing! Patricia Arquette played Allison DuBois excellent. It was almost if the dead were omnipotent! Every where she looked she saw a dead person good or bad, lost or confused and tried to at first block them out by drinking! After NBC canceled the show in May 2009 (although it was outperforming their other shows) CBS picked it up for its remaining two seasons.    Back to season 7 (the final season), was just simply amazing!! The writers, actors, directors and producers all worked hard as hell to produce one of the finest prime time shows of the 00's and 10's. Season 7 began right where Season 6 ended as Allison continued to recover from her brain tumor. Her eldest daughter Ariel went off to college this season and we got to see more acting from the middle daughter Bridgett. The first episode \\"Bring your daughter to work day\\" was a take on the film \\"Freaky Friday\\", that being said, Bridgett and Mom switched places and it was nice to have a comical relief after all the sad ordeal that ended with season 6.    The series continued to get better with each episode. We got to see more details about Detective Lee Scanlon's life and how he and his deceased brother were treated as children, and his precious daughter Lee by Lynn whom he married. Another great episode was \\"The Match Game\\", in this episode we see Allison seeing hearts on people's foreheads and thinking they are matched and fate is working, but does it work for the greater good?!?    Personally, one of my favourite episodes is \\"Talk To the Hand\\" when Allison gets a skin graft and her hand goes wild. The coffin scene is absolutely funny even though this is a crime show, a bit of humour now and again always helps. \\"Where were you when...?\\" was an episode thatleft a chill in almost all who like Medium. It brought back memories of catastrophic events and after Allison thinks a mega quake is coming she later learns a bomb is in a parking garage.    As the season progresses, we learn Joe's mother is dying and this little detail goes back to Season 4 episode \\"Burn, Baby Burn\\" in that when Allison told Joe's mother that she would be alright after she confided in Allison that she had to stop by the Mayo Clinic on the way back to Michigan. I think that episode \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" was one of the saddest in the season. Laura San Giacomo made an appearance in \\"The People in your Neighbourhood\\". Laura is remembered for \\"Just Shoot Me\\" a 90s sitcom. This episode wrongfully accuses a convicted sex-offender of molesting her daughter. But, the question is who really hurt her daughter??    As the 2011 episodes approached after a long break viewers realized the show was coming to an end. We got to see Allison's brother back, but this time it was her real life brother David Arquette, the great actor from Scream! I think they should have cast him as her brother originally, but that's just my opinion. Allison and Joe had some troubles too in the remaining episodes over Allison going back to get her law degree and Joe getting his masters. I think we can all agree on the last episode unless you haven't seen it, which I won't say much, but it is very bittersweet! I hope the DVD has an extended version of Episode 13 like they did with Season 1 episode 1. I really think a Series Finale should be 2 hours not one! Remember that Kelsey Grammar just kidding, but seriously it should have been two hours to get everything in.    The good thing about Season 7 and the whole series was watching the whole family change. They were a true life family, faced hardships like everyday people do. They lived in a modest house, struggled with jobs and had plenty of ups and downs along the way. The daughters grew which was wild seeing Ariel go to college when yousit down and watch Season 1 as compared to season 7. She really grew up! Bridgett became more funny. I think Maria Lark has a comedic career ahead because of her whit and she just cracks me up. The littlest girl Marie grew up to become a good actress too. She didn't really have many roles, but in Season 6 we got to see her act in the episode \\"Sal\\" where she fell in love with the Alarm system the DuBois family installed.    Overall, I give the whole series 5/5 because for everyday people it dealt with everyday issues from the economy, the wars, crime, struggling to find jobs, money, and dealing with teenage children and young children. Jake Weber and Patricia Arquette had a great chemistry together and I would recommend that you order this today or go out and buy it June 21, 2011! Season 7 comes full circle and I for one am glad the show got a proper finale instead of just canceling it! It brought closure to the show and didn't leave us wanting more like some series that just end! I believe if CBS hadn't moved it to 8 pm on Friday nights and left Ghost Whisperer run for a 6th Season, then Medium would have got its full 22 episodes. Now that the Supernatural shows are practically gone, my question is what kind of shows will be next? As reality shows are starting to wane, it makes me wonder what the 2010's will have for us in the coming years! So get ready and get Medium the 7th and Final Season this year!! Au Revoir Medium!! Maybe Ariel's character will do a spin-off? We will see!    P.S. I forgot to mention Season 7 will be in Blu-Ray too!! I hope they release the other 6 on Blu-Ray as Well!! And for Patricia and Jake, I wish you two long and happy careers!! You both did amazing jobs making this series! Thank You both!

It was a very slow start for me, but knowing the background turned out to be extrememly important to grasp the concept of this book.  I couldn't put it down once things started to happen.  It's a MUST READ - I've told all my friends that this is the trilogy of the year!

1582701709|1.0|I'm not sure exactly what possessed me to read this but I'm amazed at the number of people who have bought-into it.    For starters, nothing contained in the book is a \\"secret\\" at all.  It's just a collection of New Age beliefs and principles that have been around for a very long time.  It's Pantheism.  It's Gnosticism.  It's Wishful Thinking.  Is there anything new in that?    The way the author suggests, without any proof whatsoever, that various historical figures knew \\"the secret\\" and used it to their advantage is just plain fraudulent.  She cherry-picks quotations, presents them out of context, and then says \\"see, they knew the secret!\\".  Are we really supposed to believe, for example, that Jesus would have been a proponent of a world-view that claims \\"each of us is God\\"?  It would be comical it it weren't so unethical.    In the end, there were only 3 things that I learned from this ridiculous book.  1) Rhonda is a marketing genius.  2) Oprah is a New-Age goof ball.  3) People will believe anything they see advertised on TV.
1590171993|5.0|Other reviewers will have mentioned the plot lines, namely, that this novel is the life of William Stoner (1891-1956) the son of Missouri farm folk, who magically finds a calling in literature and the academic life (1910-1956), but whose achievements are thwarted by an impulsive and controlling wife and an obsessive, tyrannical English department chairman.  Since no \\"campus novel\\" is written about someone who gets all his books published and marries a wonderful person and finds wealth or fame in academia, the reader can expect the main character to encounter obstacles and to struggle, but what the reader finds are troubles that are so common as to be banal--and horribly human.  Maybe that's the magic of this novel, _Stoner_, that the commonplace obstacles are so real and plausible (the rampaging wife, the daughter who abuses alcohol, the graduate teaching assistant who is victimized by a vindictive department chair) that one wonders how they can be made into an engaging novel.  And yet, the author John Williams does it; he renders these blockages in Stoner's life into careful prose that makes the reader want to jump into the book and solve everything for the protagonist (that is, get rid of the department chair, Hollis Lomax, make Stoner free to marry Katherine Driscoll, and have a great reconciliation with his daughter, Grace).  I've never felt so much like lecturing a main character on what he should so with his life.    But, all of the elements of the story--the dynamics between students and professors, and the teaching staff and administrators--are so crafted that not one part could be changed without making this into a completely different novel.  There is something disturbingly deterministic about the plot.  It's as though author Williams saw how his novel should end and then made the characters go there.  Every sentence is such a deliberately crafted, pointed artifact, moving relentlessly to the end, that there is no way out for any character.  The narrativemethod is the omniscient (all-powerful) narrator, but author Williams stays so close to the character's own thoughts that rarely (except toward the end) can the reader tell if Williams is saying anything outside a character's own mind.    The book jacket comments say that Stoner shows \\"stoic silence\\" and a TLS reviewer said that Stoner accepts life with \\"stoical indifference.\\"  No, Professor Stoner is far from stoic about his fate; he is often flummoxed and frequently experiences great mental pain, but every time he's faced with something horrible, he chooses teaching--he chooses the literature and literary period he knows and loves.  For Stoner, only literature is available to him unconditionally.    Regarding author Williams's deterministic style--the way in which he overwhelms Stoner's life plans--there are some warning signs about the level of tragedy that will be Stoner's life.  Early in the novel, Stoner and his father have been \\"hoeing corn\\" all day (in 1910), then, at dinner his father, an inarticulate, dull man, happens to mention that an agent came by the farm house and said that the University of Missouri is looking for students for its College of Agriculture.  It would have been better had Stoner stayed on the farm, but it's this kind of decision--the seemingly simple one of going to college--that puts Stoner into harm's way.  The other signs foretelling of tragedy are Edith's hugely disconnected parents, the irony of them saying how sensitive she is and how much they will miss her if she marries.  Stoner's wife, Edith--wow!, what a tragic portrait.  It's impossible to read the last chapter without tears running down one's face.
B001JV5BIA|5.0|This remake of Wes Craven's original (approx. 1972) is in the running for a tie, if not better, the distinct cinematography excels and slap that with a compelling ending and you got ur self an extremely, enjoyable movie (excluding the 5 min. forrest, torture/porn scene-no graphic detail which is good).    CONCLUSION  I initially rented it on Netflix, however, slapped this DVD on my wishlist, then later bought it.  I highly recommend it for any one who loves the horror/suspense genre in movies.
B00008EY7H|5.0|Alegria is actually not one of my favourites of the Cirque du Soleil Series. I actually bought this for mom because this was at the top of the shows she loves. Her favourite is the Contortion Act which is shown halfway through the movie. My favourite acts were the Flying Man and the Fire Act. Both are pictured on the cover of the case too. Cirque du Soleil is one of the best series of shows ever done. I had the privilage of seeing \\"O\\" in Las Vegas. It is well worth to own these on DVD as well as their Soundtracks. If you love circus by this or the others from the series.
B002NALPCM|5.0|My favorite album of the many last years. I always admired the musicians who went their own way knowing what they were doing. Bands Jethro Tull, Yes, Talking Heads are still the best for me. I´m glad, that there are some new great people doing music. Don´t mind any genre. Take the funny and the original ones.  You may like Czech band Charlie Straight :)  Have a nice day.
B001DJ69E8|5.0|The music made by Immediate is some of the best music out there. I've always loved this type of music because--when I lisen to it--I can picture a scene in my head. The music is both exciting and quiet at times. The chorus done for most of the songs on this CD are some of the best I have ever heard. Serenata Immortale is one of these type and it reminds me of Orchard of Mines on the Globus CD Epicon. If you are big fan of exciting Chorus music this is one of the ones to get. When I hear it as well it makes it sound like I am at a Symphony Orchestra. Most of the songs on this CD have also been used behind trailers for games or shows.
0439023513|2.0|I am not going to go into great detail about the book.  Except the conclusion was very dissatisfying.  I loved the first two and would recommend them to anyone.  The third book is a skipper though.  A reader would be better off just making up their own ending and moving on.
B0017ZB8M6|3.0|Okay I will admit it, I fell under the spell of Katy Perry's I Kissed a Girl, despite myself, like a lot of other unsuspecting people when the song was released in 2008 ahead of her debut Pop-themed album One of The Boys.<br /><br />Yes, I listen--on occasion--to Katy Perry.  I know, I know, her vocal abilities leave a lot to be desired as does her grasp on the world in general if her interviews are not just a façade--this woman is a bit of a dullard--but some of her music is catchy and fun to listen to.  And while most of One of the Boys is totally forgettable, two songs stand out.<br /><br />Katy Perry--real name Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson--grew up singing gospel music and after dappling in the genre and seeing limited commercial success decided to give it up and go a different way, releasing I Kissed a Girl in 2008.  The rest as they say is history.  One of The Boys was released in June 2008 and went on to reach No.9 on the Billboard 200 music chart and has been certified platinum.<br /><br />In addition to I Kissed a Girl, the CD has spawned the single Hot & Cold (track No.7), which went on to peak at No.3 on the Billboard Hot100 music charts.  The single was also a hit internationally.<br /><br />Lyrically \\"One of The Boys\\" is a mixed bag; like most Pop albums they drift heavily toward the relationship-theme.  While Taylor Swift's (is it me or has she had more relationships than a woman twice or thrice her age. For a woman of one 21 she has been through her share of the opposite sex or is that just an impression?) songs bash sweetly, Katy Perry's are decidedly mean-spirited, bitter, demeaning, and disgruntled.  That makes them mostly fun to listen to (hey everyone likes to watch a train wreck just so long as they're not on the train), but an album full of such material is trying.<br /><br />So, as it turns out I only like two tracks on this album, I Kissed A Girl and Hot & Cold; UR So Gay (track No.6) receives honorable mention.  In the end \\"One of The Boys\\" is different than anything that has come before it with the exception of Pink.  Katy Perry is a strange bird that couldn't make it in Christian Rock so decided to shed their limiting chains and get real.  Her style is unmistakable, hard-edged and fun, and not for the faint of heart.  Never mind that Perry can hardly sing...that has come before it with the exception of Pink.

B003VYAVGA|5.0|This album is not a publicity stunt. It is the refined talent of a boy-band that somehow became the best mainstream music writing team and production team in their genre. The title and cover eludes to each member's growth to create a blend of style sound and harmony that redefines reunions. Reunited superstar Robbie Williams brings an enormous music career and musical/lyrical maturity into a band that had been reunited and relevant but lacking direction. His energy and creativity combined with  the united talent of four unique singers as well as songwriters has presented us with a unusually dynamic, fun, thought provoking, emotional, listen loud till your ears hurt record. Robbie Williams defined himself after he went down the waterfall of his first album and gave the entertainment world a sole honest voice. Take That continues a melody that brings maturity to pop culture for weary hearts to hear voices that sing past the shallow parts of thoughts and the dullness of over-produced, short-lived prima donnas that walk a wasteland of empty music. Demand music this good_
B0010T0QNQ|5.0|Best kitchen shoe around for the money.  also great non slip.  white is a pretty bad color for wearing in the kitchen but they were 10 bucks cheaper than the black ones!
0385342039|5.0|I am a big fan of Sophie Kinsella's, especially for her \\"Shopaholic Serie\\". But this novel is just... WONDERFUL: mystery, great writting style and transport us in UK!! I enjoyed it so much and hope future reader you will too.  I also hope Sophie K. will write a second in the same idea!!
0340818867|5.0|The book arrived before the term (I live in Italy) and the service was amazing! Just pay attention on the delivery charges because they are quite expensive!! :)
B00005V9IJ|5.0|Cast Away (2000) is, very simply, a classic drama that stars Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt.  What else can be said about this movie?  Great acting by Hanks, great cinematography, great scenery, great nighttime atmosphere, and a great story of survival and loneliness.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie because it's very different from most movies.  There is just a tiny amount of music in this movie.  Probably 97% of the movie has no music.  Silence is golden.  Tom Hanks should have won an Academy Award for Best Actor.  See it.
B002NUULNG|5.0|Hello,    The key to the movie is in the story. Albeit, it takes some time for it's ideas to sink in. My first viewing left me confused, but with each new viewing to see if I could get it yielded fruit. For those of you curious about this film, I see it as a meditation about the nature of reality. In the story you will be confronted with a futuristic possibility of what life would be like in an age with advanced tech some of us dream about. With dialogues surrounding questions that some of us spend our lives seeking answers to. This movie in some ways is like \\"The Fountain\\" by Darren Aronofsky. Though I bring comparison by that they both are deeply philosophical, stylized, haunting, and beautiful.    The Blu-Ray version is a marvelous piece of work. Others will have a fancy for the original as I do too. I like the original green however the remake brings the vision to life in a whole new way that makes it seem that much more. There are new additions to this with new CG scenes that made for a fairly beautiful upgrade. Though watching the original for the sake of seeing some of these scenes were actually drawn and then animated will make those realize the beauty of this movies ambitions for an animation back in its time. There are some scenes that seem a tad bit off but I'm not scrutinizing this so much since what they achieved gave me satisfaction. It's been cleaned up pretty good and when I say \\"..a tad bit off\\" I'm saying it is not quite hi-def, but it's cleaner than the original I feel. I cannot speak for the more die-hards though on this movie and hi-definition junkies. The message in the movie still rings and seems to only get louder with the coming years.    If you like animated movies with a philosophical bent in a high tech future, give this one a try. Who knows you might have a new favorite.    Cheers!
B003EYVXUU|1.0|When something is perfect, you shouldn't touch it or as people say, if it's not broken don't fix it. The original Swedish film is so beautiful in it's cinematography, it's simple cats with short dialogues and the quiet harsh Swedish winter as a main character, that the idea of remaking it sounded wrong. And wrong it was! There's nothing that the American version does to improve the original, it's just a bad remake for people who don;t feel like reading subtitles. All the mystery feeling is gone. The casting is not as good as in the original, the Swedish kids are amazing and the girl's eyes are such an important element that's lost in the remake. Making it bigger and gorier it's not an improvement. Buy the original and skip this remake.
B00005ATQM|5.0|All I have to say, is that this version does in fact sound much better! BUT...just go to Metallica's website, and buy it!  it is less than half the price there!
0802473156|5.0|I've finished reading all 5 love languages, each being very insightful. The stories shared were very touching as well.  To know how to love the person the way they need to be loved not how you think they should be loved.   Read this book and it will change your view to a healthy way to love the person your with or the person you will one day be with.  I'm single but care to know my own love language and understand love better all together so i found it to be very helpful.  Its a good price and well worth it.    Enjoy the discovery of what this book can do for you!
B0000073NC|5.0|Forget all you know about Scorpions 1980s and early 90s output, \\"Fly to the Rainbow\\" is a different animal (arachnid?) altogether.  Metalheads and punks occasionally laugh when I praise Scorpions 70s work because all they know is \\"Rock You Like A Hurricane\\", but these same people are stunned and humbled when I play for them \\"Fly to the Rainbow\\".  The sound/production of this LP is squarely in the 70s with a warm, thick rhythm guitar, spacey, gooey yet tasteful and precise leads/solos.  The bass is represented well in the mix and is solid as a rock without \\"motoring\\" or just following the rhythm guitar.  The drum sound is full and hard driving.  Klaus Meine's vocals are powerful and soaring, but also controlled and gentle when appropriate.  Meine is an underrated singer, and I rate him right up there with the great Ronnie James Dio(RIP) They even resemble each other, but I digress.  \\"Fly\\" opens with a quick and catchy number, \\"Speedy's Coming\\", an ode to rock stardom followed by the melodic and subdued \\"They Need A Million\\".  \\"Drifting Sun\\"(sung by lead guitarist Uli Jon Roth) kicks off with a riff that screams strutting-on-a-perfect-sunny-day-no-work-today-just-got-paid-joint-in-corner-of-mouth badassery.  Roth really lets his Hendrixisms shine through on \\"Sun\\", his leads and vocals are dead ringers for the deceased guitar god.  The rest of \\"Fly\\" flows effortlessly alternating between sweet guitar harmonies, slow melodies and heavy fast sections.  The last track, the title song, is the requisite epic.  Its fluid melodic riffing and harmonies ebb and flow naturally as if the band composed the song on the spot with the final moments of the song sounding like the opiate-dream-love-child of Pink Floyd and Jimi Hendrix!  After \\"Fly\\", Scorpions would become progressively heavier, much like contemporaries Judas Priest, until the 80s struck as did bland,commercial, hard rock gold.  BUY THIS AND ALL 70s SCORPIONS I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH!
B000JQUGVI|5.0|This is one of my favorite books, but I did have to muddle through it at the start. The characters are numerous and at times not mentioned often enough to stick in our memories, and Thackeray sometimes goes off on wordplay jaunts that can be confusing if you're reading without footnotes (as I was.) But, the payoff is well worth it.    Thackeray tells you exactly what he's doing (mocking upper-crust society) yet sucker punches you anyway when you realize just how good of a job he's done. His overt explanations remind you not to take the novel too seriously, ironically then giving more depth to its premise. None of this is important, he seems to be arguing. All these things we spend so much time thinking about are all very silly, even this book you're reading right now. What truly amazes me about this book is exactly how well it stands the test of time. He could be describing Becky Sharpe in 1830s London, or one of the \\"Real Housewives\\" from last Tuesday night.    Thackeray seemed to know somehow that these \\"Vanity Fairs\\" would continue indefinitely and that to try to oppose them was in itself quite vain. He seemed to believe that vanity always has and always will make the world go 'round. It shocks and delights me to see exactly how right he was.
0525423273|5.0|This book was so. freaking. cute.  It's one of the best contemporary romance books I've read.  I really enjoyed the fact that the relationships in Anna and the French Kiss are complicated and realistic - the characters suffer ambivalence, uncertainty and confusion, and that made reading it delightfully fun.<br /><br />Anna is such a great character!  Her voice and her thought processes and little peeves made her an instant favorite of mine.  If she were real, I think she'd have been my friend.  She's even got a review blog - for film rather than books, but still!  The secondary characters are realistic and well done.  I loved most of them, and loved hating some of them as well.  I adored Anna's whole group of friends that she makes in Paris.  But one thing that amazed me is that there is a very minor character that only appears in the book twice, and for but a second each time, and I fell in love with that character, too!  So yeah, I loved the characterization in this one.<br /><br />One of my favorite things about this book, though, is how realistically the relationships in it progress.  There is so much instantaneous drawing together of teens in books these days, and I think that one of the best parts about real teenage relationships is the roundabout ways that they end up happening, and all of the awkward adorableness that takes place between a crush and a relationship.  This book tackles all of that delicious awkwardness and complication, and I found that to be incredibly rewarding.  The characters and relationships in this story actually evolve and devolve, and it's REAL and perfect and amazingly fun to read.
B003O85W3A|3.0|Arcade Fire are one of the most important bands to me. \\"Funeral\\" is one of my favorite albums of last decade, and while their followup \\"Neon Bible\\" wasn't QUITE up where \\"Funeral\\" was, it was still pretty freaking incredible. All together, two of the best \\"indie\\" albums out there. So needless to say, I was pretty excited upon the announcement of \\"The Suburbs\\". I just wondered how this band would get MORE epic, MORE grandiose, MORE anthemic. They certainly have those 3 traits on this new release, however the album isn't really clicking with me.<br /><br />This album is the band's first concept album, and the concept can be summed up to, basically the most dark, melancholic depiction of The Suburbs, to the point that it's depressing. And this is where my issues with the record come in; every time I hear this, or read the lyrics, I have to ask \\"Arcade Fire, why are you so sad? Why?\\" At least back on their first 2 albums, with songs like \\"Wake Up\\", they could write depressing, melancholic songs without making them SEEM that depressing or melancholic. This band has always been moody, just not to this extent. To sum it up, if you're not into the concept of this record, you probably won't really click with the record like I didn't, because this album is deep into this concept.<br /><br />But this album is certainly not without some great standouts. The radio single \\"Ready to Start\\" and \\"Month of May\\" are considerably faster and more energetic than most of the other tracks, and are a welcome shift from the down feeling of the album. Also, \\"Empty Room\\" brings back the operatic, grandiose sound of \\"Neon Bible\\". Even a couple of the moodier tracks, like \\"Half Light I\\" caught my ear. And let's not forget \\"Sprawl II\\", one of the most acclaimed songs on here, and rightfully so. It's a great song, my favorite on this album, and honestly one of my favorite AF songs. R&eacute;gine Chassagne's vocals always floor me, whether it be this track, \\"In the Backseat\\" from Funeral, \\"Black Wave-Bad Vibrations\\" from Neon Bible, etc. She is always a welcome presence in the band.<br /><br />Overall, this is not a bad album by any means. I just think the concept sorta stood in the way of the creativity and magic of AF's other material. Clearly I'm the minority here, as this is one of the most acclaimed albums of 2010. So if you're an Arcade Fire fan, you should've already checked this out, and if you're looking into starting to listen to this band, I'd recommend starting from the beginning, Funeral, and working your way through their 3 albums.m Neon Bible, etc. She is always a welcome presence in the band.    Overall, this is not a bad album by any means. I just think the concept sorta stood in the way of the creativity and magic of AF's other material.

B003L20IJM|5.0|Nanny McPhee is a wonderful and very funny movie.  I enjoyed it very much.  It came quickly so I could have it for Christmas.  I was very pleased with the service I received.
B001615LO2|5.0|Great item - 6 year old nephew absolutely loves the wookie. It is small in nature - but appears exactly as detailed - quality fur and such...
006112429X|5.0|This is one of the most fascinating and horrifying books I have ever read. At first it starts out rather slow and plodding. My friend who recommended this book urged me to keep going. WOW. So glad I did. The plot widens and grows and then absolutely throws you off a cliff.  We Need to Talk About Kevin is a heart breaking story of a mother-son relationship. No spoiler here - I will just say this; this is a must read but not for the faint hearted!
1843106698|5.0|Tony Attwood is a recognized leader in this field.  The book is set up in an easily readable and searchable format.  His writing style is detailed and intelligent while easily readable.  Everyone touched by Autism Spectrum should have a copy.
B00006JIA4|5.0|This is a great collection. All the best songs are on here, plus a few remixes and a couple of Freddie Mercury's solo recordings. The remixes and solos are great, it's just that they crammed them all on the third CD, so that's weird. The first two CDs are completely amazing. This is also the easiest way to find the single \\"Thank God It's Christmas\\". I highly recommend this collection to anyone who still thinks classic rock is cool! Or, anyone who just thinks Queen is cool...
B0017OB12O|5.0|With all the films that have been receiving the Blu-ray treatment, I am so glad to see that \\"Bridge\\" gets the recognition it deserves.  Fantastic story, acting, writing, settings, and score.  For anyone who only knows Alec Guinness as Obi-Wan, this movie is a great introduction to depth of his talent.  I continue to wait for \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" to  have the same makeover; which incidentally includes another amazing turn by Alec Guinness.    A must own for any fan of classic films looking to rebuild their film collection in Blu-Ray format.  You will be \\"happy in your work\\" whether rediscovering this masterpiece or viewing it for the first time.

0307272702|5.0|I'm told that Why We Get Fat contains the same basic information as \\"Good Calorie, Bad Calorie\\" but written for non technical readers.     Why We Get Fat contains a series of interesting chapters designed to question the accepted wisdom of Why We Get Fat. I really enjoyed the historical references and animal studies as well as the many examples designed to question the accepted wisdom of weight gain as more calories in than out. In addition to reduced calories, accepted wisdom has told us that eating fat makes us fat and that the way to lose weight is a \\"sensible diet\\" and \\"exercise.\\"     I've been reading diet books since 1985 when I started putting on a few pounds. As anyone who has been reading these for the past 25 years knows, there are lots of ideas and lots of formulas for controlling weight. Most of these books have some theory and lots of diet examples. Why we Get Fat is mostly theory and very little direct diet advice. The end message is really simple: eating carbs causes us to get fat. Actually our degree of fatness is dependent upon our genetics and our hormonal response to foods and exercise.     What is surprising about this is that it's not the number of calories that we eat, but the kind of calories that we eat. A low carb diet can help us reduce weight without being hungry. Gary reminds us that being hungry all the time isn't a good way to live, and doesn't actually encourage us to stay on that kind of diet, which by definition must be temporary.     I had been talking to a coworker, a woman, who had been running marathons, but wasn't losing weight. We discussed diets and knew that just calories in vs calories out wasn't a very good working model. Strangely several weeks later when I purchased this book, Gary discusses this exact situation - women who run don't lose weight, and men who run don't lose as much as people might think.     I'm convinced that the calorie in/calorie out theory doesn't explain human weight changes fully. Gary's book is designed to make you question the accepted believes of the past 40 years. Gary thinks he's discovered the correct model, but understands that the scientific method will in the end tell us exactly what is happening, and why.     A great read.
0439023491|5.0|The first book, The Hunger Games left me somewhat shocked and confused. I liked it but didn't know if I wanted to continue the Trilogy.  I then picked up Book 2, Catching Fire and just loved it. Glad I continued on.  I wasn't at all happy about a second hunger game nor the circumstances surrounding it. However, it soon took on a new and interesting twist.  Catching Fire has a little more romance to it but once again we have to endure shocking violence.  I have to agree with a previous reviewer - how does the author think this up?  Each chapter brought us more surprises.  The Term 'Catching Fire' can be interpreted many different ways by readers. It will leave you guessing as a good book should.  I would say you do need to read Book 1 to truly appreciate this book. This was a winner and I'm well over young adult age.  I'm left wanting more - on to Book 3.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|I really love this Collector's Edition DVD, and I'm so glad I was patient and waited for it to be released. The case is beautiful and inclued gorgeous pictures between the disc slots. It also seems pretty sturdy so I'm not worried about the case getting cracked or anything. As far as the special features your paying for the \\"make of feature\\" and extended scenes are well worth the watch and some of the deleted scenes make you see minor characters in a different light (RDA head Harper, Norm and Trudy). It might not have the eight or whatever hours worth of extra stuff that's on the blue ray, but that really didn't matter to me. All in all if you don't have a blue ray player or simply don't want to spend the extra $15 or more on that version, you won't be disappointed with this one.    The real gem of this 3 disc set in my opinion is the Collector's extented cut. Some of the extra scenes added in add depth to Grace, Jake and the beauty of the film. Now that I've seen that version, I can't watch the original.    I only had one problem with this set: you have to change DVD's inbetween to continue the movie. That's it, nothing else and that's only because it happens to be a personal preference (I like to watch my movies in one sitting).    Many people gave this bad reviews because they feel like Avatar is just being milked for all its worth, but the truth is if your a very smart shopper and love DVD's and thier extras you probably learned a long time ago to wait six months to a year for the second release of a blockbuster (I learned my lesson with Coraline).
0525951652|5.0|I purchased this book back in October and after a week finished it.  I have positive things and negative things to say.      On the positive note, this book to me was just like other reviews - a page turner.  Every night I found it hard to put the book down and go to bed.  At times I was wrapped in the lives of the characters and others I was intrigued by the extensive research by Follett that paid off in his recount of actual events.  There is even a few paragraphs that state that the interactions between real and fictional characters that could have been possible which make this book to me an almost recount of the events before, during, and after World War I.    Speaking of characters, they are brilliantly created in this realistic world and the struggles they face are to be expected from the time period.  There are those that you cheer for and those that you jeer.  At times I was trying to figure out which five characters the book jacket refers to as the main characters and was fooled a couple of times.  Had Follett stuck to only those five characters points of view it would be easier to distinguish.     On to the negative first.  I find it hard to believe that in the aftermath of World War I and the backlash of the Versailles treaty that Americans had the same view of politics as is today.  Case in point, Follett writes \\"Are we in danger of becoming the world's policeman?\\"  I have heard that too much over the years regarding America's involvement in Iraq (1991, 2003-present) and Afghanistan (2001-present).  This could be simply the political views of Follett cleverly inserted into the book as a sway to the reader and without in-depth knowledge of the author and his views I cannot say for certain.     All in all, this was a magnificent read and I cannot wait to read the next two books in the trilogy.  If you want to be swept away in pages of historical facts and possibilities of fictional inserts, this is the book for you.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I can't say enough great things about this series.  I stayed up late many nights, glued to my kindle waiting to find out the fate of all the characters.  I found myself tearing up at the end of the final book.  To truly appreciate this story, you have to read all three books.  I loved them!!!!!
B002RN5I3M|2.0|Having read two novels by Follett and being fully intrigued and inspired, I felt compelled to read the sequel to The Pillars of the Earth - World Without End.    Although I wanted to know the story in its entirety, I was fully disappointed by this book.  For the most part it seemed as Follett was trying too hard to write a sequel that readers were wanting.  Right after putting down Pillars it was blatantly obvious how cheaply this book was written.    There are new characters who are descendants of Prior Philip and of Jack and Aliena who are primary characters in this story.  It appears as what Follett did was take the plights of his characters of his first story and shift them to new characters and tell what seemed to be another story but turned out to be the same story.  Instead of a bishop who was blocking construction paths it was the prior Godwyn; instead of the desire to build a cathedral it was to build the tallest structure in all of England; and instead of a son and daughter of a disgraced Earl to regain their position it was a former Earl who imposes his youngest son to take back the earldom.  The readers even follow characters through France, again.  Only this time it's not a civil war but another power struggle.  What's more is that just about everything is predictable that I almost put down the book and not finish it.    Bottom line, I would not recommend reading this book unless you like to be spoon fed the same story with different names attached.
032147404X|5.0|I gave this book to my son for a birthday gift. He was so pleased with the tips he learned he began using the advice given immediately. The book is easy to understand and has great tips whether the reader is experienced with photography or a beginner.  My son went out and purchased another book by the same author.   I was pleased with the speed in delivery as I ordered this right before Christmas and recieved it on Christmas Eve.
B000QJLQY4|1.0|I was very disappointed to learn that this book was not available for purchase on the Kindle in the United States.  This was one of two books that I needed for a course at the University.  However, this book was the only one that wasn't accessible if you lived in the United States.  Why this book is made available in some countries and not others is unclear to me, but I hope that the publisher will expedite what ever it takes to resolve this issue so that all Kindle users may have equal access.
B00377V6J2|5.0|I listened to the album over and over till I just OD ed on it!  folks kept telling me... you got that on every thing you burn    then I got the video...
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|This book felt very slow and left with more to be desired. It seemed very sloppy and i there was a lot of plot holes. one such hole being that the capitals so called future tech hovercrafts that fly a hundred yards off the ground and are slow enough to be shot with a bow and arrow? Really? I felt that the author could have spent more time on this book and put in more action instead of repeadtly sending katniss to hospital room where she was magicaly o.k.
B000UX6OHK|5.0|My wife loves it (maybe because I gave it to her) It is classy and delicate. You have to get a tiny little screwdriver to adjust the band to your size.
B0031RS4WU|2.0|It's a great book, interesting and well written. But the low resolution makes it almost impossible to read on kindle. Buy the hard copy.
B003JTHESA|5.0|I think this album is phenomenal. It's awesome on every level: Guitar, Bass, Vocals, Lyrics, Drums, and Album Art.  I've been playing it a lot lately. It's very interesting like their old school stuff. But, in some ways I think this is better than their old school stuff because it's more mature. I love their old school stuff, but at times it has a comic book feel to it, which is a little cheesy. The Final Frontier was created by a mature Maiden. The themes that run through this album, the imagery it paints, the guitar work, and the epic nature of the album are everything that made the old school Maiden great. This album goes a step further in that it sheds that adolescent feel, which characterizes some of their earlier stuff. This album is just straight up BAD A$$ from start to finish!    My favorite songs are THE ISLE OF AVALON, THE TALISMAN, and THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING.     PLAY THIS MUSIC LOUD!    \m/ >,< \m/  ____U_______  UP THE IRONS!
B002ZG983M|5.0|Over the top and different.  It's quite a spectacle.  The hero is good at taking beatings and he works with a tiny, foul-mouthed girl who kills bad guys.....sounds strange and it is but it works.
B002ZG9940|1.0|This is the worst film that I have seen in 50 years.  My wife asked me to turn it off and let her watch the cooking channel, and if Rachel Ray had fried chicken feet with feather pastries on the side I could have enjoyed that over the end of this movie. The next morning my wifes' first question was what did I want to do with \\"The American\\" blu ray disc. I thought of people I dont like, then said that would be unfair to give it to anyone except George Clooney who I was sure had discarded his copy of it by now. Finally I suggested that we double bag it [in case one broke] and place it in a box outside where the dogs could  relieve themselves on it for a few days and then perhaps, we would have found some useful purpose for this film disc \\"The American\\".
B002UXRGLG|5.0|OK, first off, I gave it 5 stars so I really liked it.  However, I have to say, be careful with the kids.  It is VERY graphically brutal.  VERRRRRRY.  I still can't get that baby penguin's slow drift to the bottom out of my head.  LOL  Yeesh!  It has some unbelievable footage though.  Outstanding production.  I have no idea how the photographers did what they did.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|For years I've read and re-read the Fever series, and this was just THE perfect close to it all.  I won't say \\"ending\\" because I think we'll see Mac again.  Neither will I sum it up because other reviewers have done a stellar job, but I simply had to add my five stars.
B000YENUI6|4.0|Movie was good but there was a fight scene in a shower that let you see more of \\"Aragorn\\" than you want to see. The hobbits would be appalled! LMAO
B00260HH3K|1.0|Yamcha but no Krillin.... Probably a good movie if your not a die-hard DB fan. But horrible if you are.
B003VIW8DK|5.0|Another spectacularly beautiful and enduring album by the master of cool. The divine interplay of key musicians and highly unique arrangements proves majestic; while the soothing female background vocals lend that special timeless and ethereal touch. His hypnotic lyrics and soothingly addictive melodies satisfy endlessly. While retaining its elegant smoothness, that magical voice has evolved with some earthy, grainy tones. As usual with this artist, there's an amazing coalescence of technology with antiquity to the sound. It feels both classic and progressive. A singularly miraculous work of creativity to hallmark this pioneer's accomplished and seasoned station in life. When you throw in Kate Moss, well, you've simply got a winner. There's just no one like him...
1439181780|1.0|After purchasing \\"the Secret\\" I was looking forward to this. This was a total waste of time. A lot of it was rehashed from the secret. I couldn't get past the first cd of this. I should've checked the reviews here before obtaining this product.
B000JMLFLW|2.0|I wanted so badly to love one the classic romances of all time, but couldn't.  I found the story incredibly dated.  I was able to get past the archaic use of vocabulary, but not the lack of plot.  Most of this lengthy novel is about idle English gentry socializing at each others homes.  I had nearly decided to give up on finishing the book, when it picked up a little in the final third.  I read the free Kindle edition. While the formatting is not as good as with paid editions, it is perfectly adequate.  I can't see any reason to get one of the paid versions, unless you are an Austen fan who wants the collected works organized with an active T.O.C.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|When I bought The Hunger Game it was a mistake, even if I was curious about that trilogy, I was kind of suspicious cause the main idea behind the book was the same behind Battle Royal. I was thinking, ok it's a big success but it not seems to have big originality. As I bought it, I had to read it, and it was a good surprise. The work of Suzanne Collins is amazing cause she built a complex and clever background for her \\"Battle Royal\\" story, quickly I forgot the japanese old cousin of Hunger Games, the character, the development. So yeah I've read better stories and better books, with more original idea but the author of The Hunger Games drove me inside the story, I was hunting with Katniss in District 12, I was lost in the middle of the capitol, I was stressed during the game, I was upset against the capitol... And all that it is all I am looking for in a book.<br />So Suzanne Collins good job and thank you.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|This baby is the best aftermarket cooler for the price. I was able to overclock i5 720 to 3.8Ghz with idle temps at 30degC and run full load at max 60degC. Awesome!    One word of caution is that if you have a case that has a fan on the side this might be high enough to hit that. I had to remove my side fan to be able to install my side cover. I think this will be prevented if I had a bottom mounted power supply as the CPU/cooler will be on the top part of the case and would allow this cooler to miss the side fan. I think this would have been a problem with alot of other coolers so I still gave it 5 stars.
B002KKCVUA|5.0|Purchased for a friend with disabilities as a gift.  They look great! Easy on easy off. He has not worn any other shoe since he recieved them.
B000XR4OC0|5.0|I LOVES me some Tom's shoes! I've seen a few folks around wearing them and I was intrigued. My other flats have gone the way of the do-do, so I was on the prowl for some easy, comfy flats to wear day-to-day as a new mom. I purchased my pair in a store so that I could try them on first, and the salesperson said to try a size smaller because they stretch. Indeed, my normally 8.5 foot required an 8 in order to keep the heel from slipping and to keep it snug around my arch. When I got them home I put them on with socks for a couple of hours to warm them up, because the fabric did itch my skin a bit, and ever since then they've been perfect without socks! Tempted to buy one in every color!
B003YUC2FE|5.0|Bought this for my brother for Christmas. Includes DVD and blueray discs and comes with a cute toytrunk. If you don't mind not having individual cases for each dvd then this is a really cute buy!
B000G759LW|5.0|The title alone on Back to Basics is an allusion that perhaps Christina herself thinks she might have gone a little too far with Stripped; she stops short of offering an apology -- she even has a song where she proclaims she's \\"Still Dirrty\\" -- but this album's emphasis on songs and singing, along with the fixation with the big-band era, does suggest that Aguilera is ready to be once again seen as a world-class vocalist. Nevertheless, Back to Basics also makes clear that Stripped, for as flawed as it is, was also a necessary artistic move for Christina: she needed to get that out of her system in order to create her own style, one that is self-consciously stylized, stylish, and sexy. As the endless series of pinup photos in the album's booklet illustrates, Christina is obsessed with earning credibility through association: she dresses up as a big-band vamp and drops allusions to Etta James, Billie Holiday, and Aretha Franklin, all under the assumption that listeners will think of Ms. Aguilera as the heir to that throne. While she may have the vocal chops to pull it off to a certain extent, Back to Basics doesn't quite feel like it belongs to the classic soul and R&B tradition, even if the second disc is designed to be an old-fashioned jazzy R&B album, complete with bluesy torch songs and occasionally live instrumentation. Aguilera's instincts are too modern to make the album sound classic. She remains stubbornly autobiographical -- she disses departed producer Scott Storch on \\"F.U.S.S.,\\" again addresses the abuse inflicted on her mother by her father, spends much of the album detailing her love for her new husband, Jordan, and always filters everything through a very personal filter that makes this seem like a journal entry à la Alanis Morissette (even \\"Thank You,\\" subtitled as her dedication to her fans, isn't about the fans; it's about how Christina has inspired them, saved their life, or kept them going while stationed in Iraq -- all stories recounted in the voicemail that runs throughout the track). Her lyrics remain bluntly direct, particularly when she talks about sex: \\"Candyman\\" makes her cherry pop and her panties drop, while the \\"Nasty Naughty Boy\\" will receive \\"a little taste of the sugar below my waist.\\" That combined with the slick, precise computerized production means that even when Christina tries to sound classic, she winds up sounding like the present.     But that's what's good about Back to Basics -- even though she strives hard to be a classic soul singer here, she can't help but sound like herself, and surely there is no other big-budget pop album in 2006 that bears the stamp of its auteur so clearly. As she did on Stripped, she has gotten to indulge herself here, but where she was more concerned with sound than structure last time around, on Back to Basics she spends just as much time on song and structure, often coming up with strong, memorable ballads and dance tunes on both the dance-oriented first disc and the slow-burning second. Of course, she reveals more than she intended through her indulgence. Try as she may to sound like a classic singer from the '40s, she really seems to have learned all of her moves from Madonna in Dick Tracy; whether she's shaking her hips to a canned brass section or breathing heavily into a microphone, every move seems to have been copped from Breathless Mahoney -- and that's not just on the campily retro \\"Candyman\\" (which sounds like a rewrite of \\"Hanky Panky\\"), but it's also true on the deliberately modern numbers like \\"Ain't No Other Man,\\" whose stabs of sampled brass sound straight out of early-'90s jazz-rap. When Aguilera does stray from the Madonna template here, it's to wander into Fiona Apple territory on the second disc -- with its loping piano, \\"Mercy on Me\\" is a dead ringer for anything from When the Pawn Hits the Conflicts He Thinks Like a King. There are hints of a couple other artists here -- some echoes of Norah Jones on the torch songs -- but the fusion ofMadonna and Fiona Apple is so inspired and unexpected, it sounds original because nobody else would have thought of it, or put it together in such wildly weird ways as Christina does here. Sure, Back to Basics is way too long at two discs and some of it doesn't work quite as well as the rest, but it has far more hits than misses and it holds together as an artistic statement (certainly more so than any other album made by one of her teen pop peers). It may be all about style, it may be a little crass and self-centered, but it's also catchy, exciting, and unique. It's an album to build a career upon, which would be a remarkable achievement by any measure, but coming after the near career suicide of Stripped, it's all the more impressive.    Bottom line is that Back to Basics is Christina Aguilera's best album to date and one of the best albums of 00s. Especially DISC 2 is pure perfection. She did an amazing job!
044654759X|2.0|I looked very forward to reading this book, as I have read (and own!) all other Nicholas Sparks titles.  Ever since reading his first book, I knew that I could look forward to a great read, in which Sparks included believable characters, rich content, and thoughtful life events.  Unfortunately, in this book, as I continued to progress through the book, I became more and more disheartened with the continued allusions to violence and violent thinking through the eyes of one of the characters.  Although I never expect everything to be \\"rosy\\" and happy within his books, I almost had to force my way through the ending, as it was so disturbing. I know that many times, authors find it important to explore different types of story lines, which I started to see in the past couple of his books, but I prefer the style/genre in his earlier books.  Although some of my friends who read this book liked it, for me, this book was disappointing.
B000MG1ZG0|1.0|The sound of the 2007 remaster of \\"Morrison Hotel\\" is cleaner, but the vocals on \\"Roadhouse Blues\\" have been altered.  The bonus material drags on forever.<br /><br />Altering classic albums seems to be common: similar complaints have been lodged at remasters of \\"Crosby Stills & Nash\\" and The Rolling Stones' \\"Goat's Head Soup.\\"<br /><br />So 1 Star for this 2007 version.  \\"Morrison Hotel\\" itself is worth 5 Stars, but pick up an earlier version because this isn't the album that was released in 1970.
B00338QENI|5.0|A wonderful book with intrigue and intellectual depth.  Extremely well written and clearly thoughtful of being accurately depicted. I would recommend this to those interested in science and those just wanting a good read.
0316067598|5.0|This book was riveting! Marcus Luttrell details the soldier's choice that I'm sure has been made hundreds of times this past decade along with the devasting results of that choice. All of SEAL Team 10's training and experience could not shield them from the media's bias and \\"rules of engagement\\" that imposed a choice on the team other than the choice they felt was justified. Even though they were certain that their choice would lead to a dire situation for themselves, they decided to make it then moved forward in an attempt to complete their mission. The survivors guilt that Marcus Luttrell lives with is no doubt a feeling that no soldier fighting for our Country should be obligated to bear.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|While a few unanswered questions remain I enjoyed this volume immensely.  Twists and turns.  The moment you say finally.  I would enjoy another.  Maybe we will know if we can read about Ryodan or Lor
0385341679|4.0|I agree with most that the series ended well....I actually didn't really like the Fever Series in the beginning, I didn't plan on continuing after book 2.  In this final book all the major questions are answered and Barrons and Mac finally hook up.    I definitely see a spin off with so many characters and look forward to seeing what Moning creates.   This book is definitely more introspective than action packed, but in order to get all our questions answered it has to be.  I'm happy the series is done - it couldn't have gone on much longer, but I am sad to say goodbye to Barrons (one of these best alpha male characters our there).
B004GCJ11C|5.0|I can't help myself when it comes to diet books that have a vegan focus. I've read them all! So, I had to read this one too.<br /><br />While I didn't find any of the information new (I think if you've read any diet book, esp. a vegan one like skinny bitch or thrive it'll be familiar), I really enjoyed Kris's tone and how she just gets to the point. She has a great personality that really keeps your attention -- and I wish I'd have read this book first, not after Id read so many other books covering the same topic... I like her brevity! She's just so straight-forward...no nonsense!<br /><br />I will be recommending this book to everyone as I think its more \\"one-size fits all\\" than some of the competitor books... my only complaint was her recommendation of oil. Oil is a highly processed junk food (it does not occur naturally in nature like fruits, veggies, seeds, nuts, grains and beans) -- if you're gonna give up all other processed crap like she recommends, give up that too.
B003BWERF8|5.0|With the exception of the packaging and shipping container this little gem is perfect. We use it on an Ipod to stream music to our stereo in an adjacent room or on our deck. It's perfect. We avoided the Sony transmitter because it does not give you the ability to change volume from the Ipod. This one does and it works perfectly. We have a Belkin receiver and transmitter we used on our 4th Gen HP Ipod and this works fine with that receiver. A small case would be nice to store this when not in use.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|I bought the Beatles box set last minute for my husband for Christmas. Last minutes was 2 days before Christmas. It was delivered exactly as promised, thank goodness.  I thought my husband was going to have a heart attack when he opened this gift. I received more hugs and kisses that day than I did the whole month!! He listens to the CD's everyday and also commented on the fact that there's a lot of interesting information along with each CD.  He hasn't stopped talking about the box set and has said this is the best gift ever!!  The look on his face when he opened it and the enjoyment he's gotten out of listening to them daily made them well worth the cost.  This Box Set is an exceptional deal and I would highly recommend this set to everyone. I did my online shopping before I ordered, and Amazon had the best price, the ordering was hassle free and ultimately the shipping was fantastic.  What are you waiting for, ORDER NOW!!!
031603438X|5.0|I really enjoyed Mr. Richards book, Its one of those I had a hard time putting down.  I had no idea what a family man he is and was, as a teenager, I just hought he was a hard rock drugger going no where  real fast. After reading the book, I feel much different!  I must say the story about the family  trip to see wildlife had me bursting out laughing. The pooping monkeys, the 6 legged elephant was ever so funny! And thanks for the pictures! Great!
B001UV4XFG|3.0|Although this movie hit all of the high points of the story, I found it very choppy.  It really didn't flow like the other two did.  I was a bit disappointed since I really loved how the first two movies translated.  This one just didn't seem to work as well.
B00192IV9U|4.0|This CD is probably one of the best MJ CDs since his HIStory CD. The music takes the old style of Thriller and his earlier work and brings it back with a modern twist with the collaborations with modern artists. I was very surprised to hear a GOOD MJ CD after suffering through albums like \\"Blood on the Dance Floor\\" which was much hyped by the critics, but a flop. This CD seems to be just the opposite, if you are a MJ fan and have been waiting for a good upbeat CD, your wait is finally over.
B0025KVLVA|4.0|Naturally, when you release a comprehensive or nearly-comprehensive album of singles, you're going to get a mixed bag. Of course, it's the Beatles, so it's hard to go wrong, and there are some indispensable classics on here (Hey Jude alone makes it worth my while, for example). However, I definitely wouldn't pick this as my first Beatles album.
B0030Y11O2|5.0|Basically everybody has given you the basic idea of this film so I will not.  But I do want to make one comment about those who claim Michael Moore is a liar.  We all know that in recent years the at Michael Moore has attacked the conservative movement and many claim he is a liar because of that.  And since that is the case boy am I glad to hear that he is a liar in this film to since he blames the entire situation on both parties.  That is right on this film Moore does not take a side.  And in all honesty my son did a similar film almost 3 years ago (Before the Bank Bailouts.)  Although his mostly did with the way the news media was approaching the subject of Illegal Immigration, he too discovered a link that Michael Moore also stated in this film (The corruption of business started when unknown forces started taking control of the White House towards the end of Jimmy Carter's Term, and the downfall started shortly after Reagan became president.
B000BEZPQE|5.0|Slipknot is one of the best, most energetic bands I've ever seen live.  This album does a great job of capturing their energy with a fantastic song list.
0142428280|5.0|I picked this tome to listen to in my car and am very glad I did.  I love historical fiction, and this one was done very well.  At times, a poignant commentary on changing class and gender relations; at others, an interesting attempt to explain the politics behind WWI.  Overall, a good read.      Yes, the idea that all of these diverse characters cross paths in the many ways they do is highly unlikely.  But this isn't a work of profound literature, it is supposed to be an enjoyable historical novel!  I must say I appreciated the whimsy.  Frankly, I could do without some of the sappy romance story lines, but they provided some risqué moments of fun.      For those considering the audio version, the reader is fantastic.  He does a great job with accents and differentiating between character voices.
4893580914|5.0|Unlike a lot of the silly Japanese learning resources out there, this book combines innovation with substance. The innovation is the illustrations, in the beginning of the book they show a picture morph into the character. In later chapters they have signs, and other practical applications. I really enjoyed them, because instead of just seeing a kanji as a squiggly line connected to another squiggly line, you can visualize it pictorially. Plus, my Kanji writing has gotten better. I think some younger learners (the people who bought Kanji De Manga) may be put off by the fact that it has a plain and simple presentation, but if you can get past that it's the best kanji learning resource out there.    So yeah, Buy it now!
B00005QDW5|5.0|I'm a Pink Floyd fan from way back yet, along the way, I never got some of the CDs back I loaned out to friends. \\"Echoes\\" was among them and I'm more than happy to have found it once again on Amazon. The quality of the 2 CDs is very good, I just have to turn up my Bose to a higher volume to get the full effects of the instrumentals. Very happy with the purchase but this time - no more lending out to friends! I'm keeping this one!!!
B001G9F9IW|5.0|bardem fell in love with cruz during the filming, now they are married with kid.  even without the chemistry this would be a great film.  warning - this is an adult film, if you do not like european movies you will not like this.  OTOH if you like foreign films (assuming you are a USA citizen) you will like this.  you also might like this movie if you are interested in what makes artists tick.  barcelona is where it takes place  vicky and christina are the two american love interests of bardem.  i hope woody makes a sequel some day...Vicky Christina return to Barcelona...
B0049OSQ18|5.0|Love the theatrical older albums too, but this one is such a great singalong, listen-along. I haven't even gotten past Down by the River yet. Neil Young, the Band, Planxty, REM, Green Day, so many references. This one has a lot of heart.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Although, this book was pretty easily predictable, I still found myself engrossed in it. It was a fun love story with the twist of Logan & the found picture. I thought the ending was perfect and found it a very easy read. Although it is not a book that really gets your mind working, it is a perfect beach book.
B001FB55L2|5.0|Wow.  This movie is amazing.  I didn't think it would be that good, but throughout the whole movie there was pain, pain, some more pain, some sadness, some more sadness, and eventually HOPE!  This movie definately should have gotten more credit than it has.  I was reading the other reviews about Toby's performance.  And it was good, but he really shines at the end.  His emotion and acting is incredible.  Spider-man has no justice for this movie.  If you don't know much about the war still going on, watch this movie.  It will help you realize what some of the soldiers are going through.  I am still in shock at the ending.  It was a great ending, but I wish they would have shown more with the family afterwards.  You will understand what I mean when you watch it.  Definately a must see movie though, I usually don't create reviews for movies just because there are so many, but this one really stood out!
B0018AK9RA|5.0|If you are a fan of Judas Priest, get this! I've been a fan of Priest since Screaming for Vengance, and I'm telling you - this is the album I wish had followed (or even been released instead of) Turbo!    Turbo was, well, Turbo; Painkiller was 'we can still be heavy . . . look how heavy we are.' This album is Judas Priest, plain and simple. I can't tell you how many times I have listened to it, and I still want to hear it again! It fits into the pre-Turbo Priest cannon very well.    If all your experience with \\"metal\\" music has been from bands with cookie monster vocals, you probably won't get this album and pan it. And those interludes when the guitarist is playing notes and not chords are called solos - something we musicians did before Ritalin drugged ambition and creativity out of us. Sorry - I just had to say that!    If you are a fan of good music before the dark times, before the '90s & hair bands, then this is a good pick for you. The best and most descriptive thing I can say about Nostradamus is that it is Judas Priest in their best form. Everything you would expect from a Priest album and more.    More because Nostradamus moves the ball foreward creativly for the band. Not one song on the album is a rehash of this Priest song, or almost the same riff from that song. That's amazing in a way, since the album does capture the feel of classic Judas Priest in so many ways. Maybe it's because they are not afraid to slow things down like they did before British Steel, as on Stained Class etc.    In fact, \\"Lost Love\\" from Nostradamus brought tears to my girlfriend's & my eyes -  \\"And though there were bad times/We stood together/And did what we had to get through\\" - maybe you can't appreciate that line or the song if your longest relationship is measured in weeks. If you've had to face some trials and made it through, though, then this song alone will justify your purchase of this CD. I can't imagine an anniversary or recommitment ceremony without \\"Lost Love.\\"The rest of the songs on this CD are heavy rockers, good driving music, workout music, whatever you like. I am so happy with Nostradamus, and happy I have it in my collection. JUDAS PRIEST IS BACK!!
B002ZG997M|5.0|I first saw this movie when it hit theaters and i thought it was epic. The action was intense, the story wasnt half bad and the characters, costumes, special effects, and shoot locations were perfect, the only reason anyone could hate this movie and give it a 1 star is if they are idiotic atheists who hate life and anyone but themselves.
0440539811|1.0|Okay, let's take some steampunk, some Da Vinci Code, some Percy Jackson, some vampire and Atlantis lore and water it down with some 9/11 paranoia. Hand it out to the some adolescents and have them write some plots based upon this. Then take those plots, smoke some pot, invent some corny lingo like 'fnord' and then begin cutting and pasting like hell so you don't get sued by Rowling, Dan Brown, Stieg Larsen, Neil Gaiman, Stephanie Meyer, Anne Rice or whoever. Might just be the ghost of Plato for all I care - and you got yourself a book, gentlemen. Okay, let's publish it! Okay, we haven't proof red it or anything, but who cares, we just got to laundry som money.  That's at least my impression of this totally crappy book.    That someone even finds this even half entertaining is beyond me, because it's so utterly awful! Do avoid this with all means, and get some good old Sherlock Holmes instead.
0374158460|1.0|Franzen begins this novel with a strong voice, but as I progressed through the book, I became lost in the sickness that envelopes ALL of the characters.  I began to suspect that Franzen doesn't care much for women and their feelings since we are led to believe that women have \\"a lot of female bulls*#\\", which is how he tends to describe most emotions of the female variety.  Right.  Like the male characters are so above reproach!     The Great American Novel this is not!  I suppose that Franzen's $10 SAT words he sprinkles in every 20 pages might lead one to consider the man intelligent, but I was not impressed.  I found his choices smacking of desperation and the desire to impress less sophisticated readers, like a college freshman in a first year comp. course who's just recently discovered the Thesaurus.  His dialogue is so similar from character to character that by midway through, any magic was lost in his common, \\"Ha, ha, ha,\\" which I guess means Franzen was so caught up in writing his manifesto that he couldn't be bothered with conjuring genuine emotion for his characters besides sarcasm and suicidal fantasy.  Let's face it, joy is a much more difficult emotion to convey, which Franzen proves again and again.    If you believe that the world is made up of stupid conservatives who shoot cute animals, while mopping their kills up with loads of paper towels and heroic liberals who despise the masses then this is the book for you.  If you instead believe that the world is made up of mostly good people with good intentions, then you'd best steer clear of this depressing, self-indulgent, clunky piece of crap. I'm far too moderate to swallow Franzen's apocalyptic vision of America.
0385341679|5.0|I'll keep it short and sweet.... i've seen the reasons people listed for disliking this book and have to disagree with them, even if it is their own opinion. i wouldnt tell someone NOT to read a book.. any book, simply because (  I  ) didnt like it. thats just silly.<br />My biggest complaint with the past books(and most books in a series) is the author's annoying habit of rehashing past details. Thats why each Harry Potter book kept getting bigger and bigger. I THINK Karen realised that her fans are obsessed enough to not need a lot of rehashing. We have read and re-read these books so many times we know them by heart.<br />And i know people wanted every little question answered but i think they are reading too much into those questions. either they were never important to begin with, or its been left unanswered because ................. there WILL be other books written. You cant please everyone and you should never expect to be pleased by an author. this series was her baby and she wrote it exactly the way she wanted to. its always a gamble when you put yourself out there for others.<br /><br />Hey i was more than pleased with it. my only complaint is i will have nothing to do now. Like most Moning Maniacs, once you've finished one of Karens books you're basically Priya.... you crave and hurt and desire more and nothing else satisfies, pales in comparison...
B004CEUEWE|4.0|Really enjoyed watching this movie. Great action. Ben did great job. Few things were unrealistic like actress not recognizing any of their voices later specially Ben's as he had very distinct voice.
B0041YI4ZO|3.0|I see that a lot of people here got bad DVD's. I know how that feels and I guess for once I am lucky in this case. I bought it several months ago from Amazon and it's a fine movie as far as quality goes. It's in 2.35 format which my personal preference is 1:33 or at least 1:85, I hate letterbox and wish there was an option on all movies for sale to get it in full screen. Other than that, the movie was fine but a bit disappointed that Donnie Yen was not in the title roll again. When you purchase these types of movies that are usually imported, the writing is all in Chianese and you just can't tell who's in it or what the plot is. I just bought Ip Man 2, which will be released here in April 2011, so I hope this one is a bit better than 3, since Donnie Yen is back in the title role again. Nick.
B0002EQ7EC|5.0|This is just beautiful music. I replaced my first copy after it disappeared. Very sophisticated rhythmically, harmonically and lyrically. The \\"World Music\\" percussion with layers of amazing instruments and voices, over which Paul Simon's genius floats keeps me coming back over and over. In addition, the recording, mixing and production is second to none. The percussion tracts are without comparison. Sonically the whole album is amazing.    This is truly timeless music - unfortunately many people won't give it the concentrated, repeated listening that will reap it's deep rewards. Just listen and isolate in your mind one of the percussion or guitar tracts and see; then realize there are many layers above and below to explore as well.
B0036EH3WK|1.0|We were completely disappointed with our purchase due to the fact that when we went watch it we received the wrong disk's.  We got 2 disk of season 6 disk 2 instead of disk 2 of season 1.  And when we tried to get this issue corrected we were unable to get any help.
B004G6009K|5.0|Went to see \\"Tangled\\" today.   I have to say that I think it was the best movie that Disney has put out in a long time.  We had ages 7, 12, 40 and 52 there.   We all laughed throughout the movie.  The graphics were good, the humor was for all ages and the storyline kept our interest.   I have read some of the worst reviews on here and I have to say that they got it wrong.  It was a GREAT movie.  I am sorry they just don't get it.   It's a fantasy, it's a love story, it's a battle between good and evil.  It's a good family film.  We will own it.
1416911049|2.0|Well, this book most certainly had an interesting premise. However, the way Westerfield carried it out was poor. If he had gotten new characters, more creative names for his settings, etc, it may have proved to be much better. However, this did not happen. Westerfield's characters were shallow and hard to really want to care about. For me, one of the most important things in a novel is characters.If I don't care about the characters, I don't care about anything else. Tally spent most of the novel whining about turning pretty, whining about Shay running away and now she has to go find her. The best friend situation was sort of stereotyped. The whole \\"opposites attract\\" thing was going on. Very annoying.<br /><br />The names were not creative. The Uglies live in Uglyville and the Pretties live in Pretty Town. Are you serious? The Uglies are, well, ugly, and the pretties are (*gasp!*) pretty!<br /><br />And, oh.my.goodness, the opening line of this book! \\"The sky was the color of cat vomit.\\" Really? That's not the best way to start a novel. We don't need any opening lines that are going to go down in history, but really, that's not a good way to start a book. That's like starting the book, \\"The clouds were the color of baby poop.\\" I know it was supposed to be symbolic of how Tally was feeling, but come on. And then it goes on to say that Tally thought it was pretty. Wait, what? I don't think anything resembling barf is pretty.<br /><br />I don't recommend this book, nor the books to follow. If you ABSOLUTELY MUST read it, check it out from the library and spend your money on a GOOD book.
B003ZHQVJO|5.0|Born Free is an outstanding album top-to-bottom.  Give it a few listens and crank it up on a Friday night and you will be hooked.  That is provided you like straight ahead rock & roll, tinged with countrty and blues and laden throughout with great melodic hooks and guitar licks.  Love this album!  More laid back than Rock-n-Roll Jesus,but maybe better overall, especially with Rubin's production.
0553801473|3.0|George RR Martin always claimed he needed the 5-year gap between \\"Feast for Crows\\" and \\"Dance\\" to deliver a quality product and worked tirelessly on this sequel. To me, despite the long wait, the book reads more like a rushed effort that was not really edited at all. There are multiple redundancies in the plotlines, and many chapters that don`t move the plot at all.<br /><br />Even worse, the initial plan to divide several Point of View - characters storylines (Dorne, Iron Islands, Kings Landing etc. in \\"Feast\\"; Meereen, The Wall etc. in \\"Dance\\") is not followed through as several \\"Feast\\" characters appear in \\"Dance\\". The books were once intended to be published as a single volume, but now one would like to re-organize the disjointed chapters/timelines again. The character development of Daenerys is written badly - she is a mere damsel in distress in this book, unlikely, given her development in the previous sequels. And Martin also overuses dramatic cliffhangers in this installment.<br /><br />The good news: Many chapters - except the Daenerys storyline - are very readable, it is certainly a better novel than \\"Feast for Crows\\", and even if it doesn`t help the plot development, the place & landscape descriptions make it a pleasure to get lost in Westeros (or Meereen, Ghis etc.) again. This author can still write if he only would put some effort and dedication in it. But I have now serious doubts that all loose ends and cliffhangers can be advanced to a satisfying conclusion of the series.
B00005TQKQ|1.0|Buying the Sony 8mm head cleaner was a complete waste of money.  It might have worked if it was like my other video head cleaners that include liquid solution along with an abrasive fabric tape to do the work.  The tape in the head cleaner appeared to be no different then a standard 8mm tape, and thus did absolutely nothing in cleaning my video camera heads.  I repeated the process several times, with no better results.  I would not buy this product again.

1441965904|4.0|I haven't come across a book like this before that is tailored specifically for non-native speakers. It contains loads of ideas not just for the students for whom it is intended but also indirectly for trainers like myself. It basically addresses all the fears my students have and comes up with sensible and feasible solutions. Even the shyest student should be able to do a reasonable presentation after reading this book.

1932100660|5.0|This book is a real eye opener. The facts are there. If Americans don't change their diet, they're going to die. Just take a look around.  Do you see overweight Asians?  If you say YES, its because they have adopted an American diet.  Older Asians are slim because they eat a plant based diet. This book opened my eyes. And I started eating differently and within a short period of time, I saw differences.  This book is full of facts, just the facts.  The conclusions are yours to make.
B004EJ1GB0|1.0|This film has got to be a joke! No one really thinks like this, right? If they do, it's obvious bigotry. There are two sides to the story, of course. There is the anti-Gringo/anti-American side that believes America stole Texas, and then there's the side that wants anyone \\"trespassing\\" on American soil to be killed. First off, the movie maker assumes there is no other view in America, except to kill Mexicans or any other Latino. Worse, though, is the view that all Mexicans/Latinos want is to kill anyone that wants to stop them from entering America in any fashion they chose, but also that it's fair to kill anyone and everyone anyway. The fight scenes are pure comic book, the gratuitous naked girls are scripted thirteen year old fantasies (\\"magically\\" naked Lohan waiting for the pool boy) and the story line about as week as anyone could dream up. The shooting of a U.S. Senator in this film may have been a really bad idea considering recent events, but let's not place blame!    If you like comic book fantasies that could never happen in real life, enjoy. \\"Machete\\" and the actor playing him are pretty lame. Really.

0385341679|1.0|I was so disappointed with this book that I went back and read all my previous reviews about the other books in the series. As betrayed as I felt as a reader with the outcome of this final instalment, I realised all the books were flawed, because of MacKayla's personality. She's a stupid girl who never deserved V'lane's love and adoration, even though he was suddenly changed into a completely different character at the end of this book. Despite all my hangups with the non-answers to the plot by the end of Shadowfever, I realised there's just no salvaging these stories. MacKayla is a character I will never sympathise with. Her bipolar personality isn't an excuse, and her entire character would have to be overhauled to give these books any substance. I'm so devastated with the concluding instalment of Shadowfever, but I suppose it was a wakeup call. No matter how much I wanted to lose myself in the fantasy world of these books, the realism of characters was always going to be impossible. At the end of book 3 and the start of book 4 I thought this was the best book series I'd ever read. But now I see it's only because those books finally got to the gratuitous sex scenes the other novels attempted to build towards.
030746363X|5.0|I've read many books on fitness, diet and exercise.....and this is the first one that seems to pull it all together.  So many fitness books want me to devote more time to fitness than I seem to have the drive for, and diet books that want to control how you eat forever, but this one make it all seem within reach.  The writing is humorous and interesting, all backed by studies and facts.  I look forward to my new body.
1594202842|1.0|I tend to think of myself as very open-minded.  Accepting and always willing to learn something new.  Keep in mind I only read the sample as you read my review.  While I could appreciate the authors persective about culture differences and could easily see myself as the western mother who could learn a few things about tightening the reigns on my children, I definitely felt as though the author presented her culture above others and I found her to be very self-absorbed and excessively confident!
031606792X|4.0|I am new to the Twilight series. I watched the first 3 movies over one weekend and then came here to read the reveiw of Breaking Dawn. They were so scathing that I decided to read Breaking Dawn first, just to see what all the fuss was about. I read it in 2 days and I must say, I don't understand all the hate. I thought it was an entertaining, easy read. Just what I want from a fictional story about vampires and humans in love. Like many other reviewers, I was disappointed with the lack of a good sex scene but, I will forgive Meyer since I know she is writing for young teens versus 30 year olds like myself. BUT, I must say that I remember some pretty good makeout scenes in the Judy Blume books of my teen years so, she could have done a bit better. My only other gripe was the lack of a good showdown with the Volturi. All that buildup and gathering of cool, superpower vampires and then...nothing. I feel that Meyer got tired of writing and copped out.   So, at the end of the day, I don't think Breaking Dawn deserves all the daggers thrown its way. No, it was not Jane Austen but, I wasn't expecting it to be a literary classic. Just a good, fun read. Now I am off to start Twilight.

B000QUCNOK|5.0|It is, I believe, a very special feeling; a frisson, indeed, to experience - to anticipate watching a movie made after a great cult novel, and all the apprehension, the scepticism, and yet,the hope arising each time the visual medium invades the realms of literature; one can just mention \\"The Name of the Rose\\" to illustrate the point.    I'd held all the apprehensions one is guaranteed to hold on such an occasion, and was prepared to make concessions for the director who challenged the \\"unfilmable\\" verdict for the novel.     I didn't have to. The movie demonstrated the astonishing combination of audacity and artistic sensitivity to the medium. I appreciated the editing effort to adapt the book for the screen ( such as \\"truncated\\" story of Jean-Baptiste  with his much shortened stay in the cave, or the omission of the episode with Marquis lest it would distract from the final objective); other deviations from the situations, described in the book,as well as slight additions, I found justified either by the medium, or by the artistic task the director obviously set for himself: that is, to create a sense of Jean-Baptiste's determination in realising and achieving his goal.     I'm glad the director   treated the end without gory, explicit details, demonstrating the true sense of power of his medium and staying true to the aesthetics of proportion and measure which harks all the way back to Aristotle and which, certainly, was upheld during the epoch in question. A remarkable cinematic achievement.

078681859X|5.0|I love fantasy books and this one has been added to my list of excellent books. Witty, sarcastic and refreshing. Usually demons are the 'bad guys' and humans and magicians the opposite but in this book, the tables are turned. If you love fantasy books and magic I highly recommend it.
B0042UE0RS|5.0|I met John Lennon once and it is one of those moments you share with others and never forget. He was and still is a true man for and of the people. This mix of tunes demonstartes that.

0316077054|5.0|I was super excited to read Beautiful Darkness. I have been waiting to read this book ever since I finished Beautiful Creatures, and it did not disappoint. From the moment I opened Beautiful Darkness and started reading, I was immersed in Ethan's world. Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl are absolutely amazing to have written this book. Their writing is absolutely intoxicating. I loved how Kami and Margaret set the scene for this book. The very first page brought back all of the love I had for Beautiful Creatures. I love their writing because it feels like I am right there in Gaitlin with Ethan, and I was excited to discover what happens.    I enjoy being in Ethan's head because most books I read are from a girl's point of view. It is nice to hear what the guy thinks once in a while, and Ethan definitely has a lot going on in his life. He discovers something new about himself, and he puts it to good use. I felt bad for Ethan in this book because Lena, his girlfriend and the love of his life, pushes him away throughout the book. For most of the book, he could not reach Lena like he used to.    There were many times throughout reading that Lena really annoyed me. I hated how much she was acting like a completely different person. I did not like how she treated Ethan especially when she ran off with another guy. She just seemed to ignore him and was letting herself drift away from him. She may have been doing it to protect him, but I still did not like it. I am not saying I hate Lena because I don't. I actually do like her most of the time. She was just in a difficult place in this book. She believes she killed her Uncle Macon, so she becomes emotionally broken causing her to push Ethan away even though he wants to help her.    I was surprised to see how much of a role Ethan's mother played in the story. It was interesting to see that she can still influence his life even though she is dead. I was also surprised to see Ridley practically changing sides. In Beautiful Creatures, she was all about making Ethan's life miserable, but now she actually ends up helping Ethan save Lena. A new character also joins Ethan's group of friends. Her name is Liv, and she is a Keeper-in-training. I enjoyed her personality and humor, so I hope she is in future books.    Beautiful Darkness is a must read (but read Beautiful Creatures first if you have not already). I liked it better than the first book if that is at all possible. It was addicting from the beginning to the end. I loved the mystery of the story and how unpredictable it was. It had me guessing and making up all kinds of crazy theories! I am looking forward to reading the next book in the Caster Chronicles.
0439023513|5.0|I loved the trilogy!  I know alot of people were unhappy with the ending, but to me, it felt real.  War isn't pretty.  People aren't perfect.  That was why I liked Katniss so much.  She was flawed and she was affected by what was going on around her.  The ending was painful, but perfect.
0007202288|5.0|The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a classic tale like no other. The story follows Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy as they plunge into the world of Narnia. Digory from The Magician's Nephew makes an appearance, but he is now known as Professor Kirke. Of course, the White Witch also reappears as does Aslan. If you have read The Magician's Nephew you know how the wardrobe came to be.    The Pevensie's are great characters. I actually liked them more than the characters in the previous book. Edmund did annoy me at times, but I think he was supposed to be like that since he did betray his siblings. Great story from beginning to end.    I thought The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was a fun book to read. There is a lot of symbolism in this book that relates to Christianity. I think people of all ages enjoy this book, so if you have not read it, I recommend you do.
0385523912|4.0|The year 1994 was a disaster for North Korea. The country's Great Leader and Hero of the Revolution, Marshal Kim Il-sung, died suddenly. Crop output was only 75% compared to the previous year, an ominous sign of the famine that would come. The economy was on the verge of collapse and there wasn't a safety net to catch anybody. Twenty-four million people were held in the firm grip of the Korean Workers' Party, who had spies on every block and who deemed it a capital crime merely to be caught listening to South Korean radio. In Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea, Barbara Demick tells the stories of six North Koreans over a fifteen-year period starting in 1994, the year the country plunged into literal darkness.<br /><br />After the shocking death by heart attack of the Great Leader, Eternal President Kim Il-sung, the North Korean public felt orphaned. Marshal Kim Il-sung was revered as a Father to the Korean People, and without his love and guidance the population felt lost and without hope. Nationwide scenes of mass hysterical mourning, which can be viewed in news clips on YouTube, seem plausibly real and not as staged teary wail-athons when you read the testimony of the Koreans who were there at the time.<br /><br />Demick conducted all of her interviews with defectors who had risked their lives crossing the North Korean border with China. These defectors mourned en masse for their Great Leader, yet crawled over dead bodies lying in the street as famine gripped the nation. Starvation killed millions in the northern part of the country and you will wince in horror as the defectors describe how the creeping bony hand of hunger came closer every month to snatching their lives away. People ate weeds and grass, and ground the bark of trees to make a flour substitute. The elderly and very young died first, and for one kindergarten teacher Demick profiles, Mi-ran, the number of students she taught fell from fifty to fifteen. Although the people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea relied on the government in every aspect of their day-to-day lives, during the time of the famine, however, the government did nothing to save them. Food rations stopped, crops and fields were bare and store shelves remained unstocked. As the economy collapsed, electrical blackouts turned into a permanent state of powerlessness, leaving machinery idle and people unemployed. The Korean Workers' Party left millions of its own people to fend for themselves, dying a slow death by starvation.<br /><br />Demick interweaves these stories and testimonies and sometimes it was confusing trying to figure out who was who. Four of her six interview subjects were women, who happen to make up the majority of North Korean defectors, and I often carried one woman's story from one chapter to the next, not realizing that Demick was now talking about someone else.<br /><br />When the defectors finally arrive in the South, they are held in confinement for a period of one month for debriefing, in order for the Southern authorities to ensure that the people claiming asylum are bona fide political defectors and not North Korean spies (which has happened far too often). However, once the North Koreans are permitted to enter the South, they often find integration difficult:<br /><br />\\"North Korean defectors often find it hard to settle down. It is not easy for somebody who's escaped a totalitarian country to live in the free world. Defectors have to rediscover who they are in a world that offers endless possibilities. Choosing where to live, what to do, even which clothes to put on in the morning is tough enough for those of us accustomed to making choices; it can be utterly paralyzing for people who've had decisions made for them by the state their entire lives.\\"<br /><br />Eventually loyal party ideology is trampled by pangs of hunger, and the human desire for survival. Those who had previously viewed defecting as treasonous were now lining up to make deals with brokers who would ensure their safe passage across the Chinese border. The six people whose stories are told in Nothing to Envy were able to bring some family members to the South yet their hearts ache for the children and family they had left behind.passage across the Chinese border.

0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games is definitely one of my favorite books. Every time I read it, I am sucked into this dystopian world that Suzanne Collins has created. I just love the way that she writes. As one chapter ends, I find myself starting the next chapter even though I promised myself I would read only one more chapter and then get back to the real world.    The main character, Katniss, is amazing. I love that she is a strong, independent girl who is smart and has great survival instincts. After her father died, she even took it upon herself to take care of her family by hunting for food even though it is illegal. She loves her little sister, Prim, more than anything, and she does everything in her power to protect her even when it involves risking her own life. The only reason she becomes a contender in the 74th annual Hunger Games is because she took her sister's place. The Capitol is horrible to force 12 girls and 12 boys to fight to the death in the Hunger Games! It takes reality TV to a whole new level. I could not even imagine having to watch these games each year. The violence that Katniss had to witness and live through is horrendous, but it does make for a great book.    The Hunger Games is the type of book that stays with you long after you finish reading it. It is such an exciting story full of action, adventure, and violence. There are some parts that are so suspenseful that the story will have you on the edge of your seat devouring the pages to discover what happens next. The story makes you think about what you would do if you had to live in a world like that. The ending always leaves me wanting more, so I cannot stop myself from immediately picking up Catching Fire to read. It is no surprise that this book is a quick read and an addicting series. I definitely recommend reading it.
B001NEK2GE|3.0|Not really going to go to much into it. What a lot of people said about pro's I would have to agree, there were some cons that really bugged me.        Cons: The first thing I noticed was that the screen while nice seems a bit worthless. In games like WoW it does show you your stats, but rarely is that of any importance. Another nice feature is that it alerts you when someone sends you a whisper, but in my case it would still be on the screen long after the final conversation. Another thing is that it rarely faded or alerted you of any new whispers so sometimes you would miss one or think you got another one. The other thing is the screen for me at least in in an area where you really wont notice it at all.        The biggest Con for me was its ability to reset my macros mid fight in some cases. Its something irritating when a fight is going well and your g13 key does an autorun instead of your macro or when my jump button would cause me to cast an important spell when I really needed to conserve it. I am not really sure what is causing it which is something that bugs me. It could be switching chars or alt-tabbing, the problem with that is its fine for awhile afterwards and then BAM automatically reverts to the old settings. I could see if all my chars used different keys for different things, but I spent awhile mapping keys so that virtually all important spells or abilities were in the same spot with all the chars.       With that there are nice features, plenty of space to put macros easily reachable, screen sets profiles between games so theres no hassle with that, There are tons of color options and allows maximum comfort. The problem for me is the unreliable software. Which is a shame, if anyone reads this, invest in a new keyboard or mouse and if you really need the G-13 at least wait til its on sale.
0439023491|5.0|Before re-reading Catching Fire, I forgot how much I loved it! I do not know how she does it, but Suzanne Collins has done it again. It is as good if not better than the first book, The Hunger Games. This series is extremely addictive. I could not put done this book even though I have read it before and know what is going to happen. With all of the action, it is such an exciting book. No wonder it was a quick read.<br /><br />Like the last book, the characters are just amazing! Katniss is the same as the last book: strong, independent, and capable. I just love her as a main character. Resulting from her actions in The Hunger Games, she unknowingly ignites the spark that ultimately starts uprisings and rebellions against the Capitol in many of the districts. Obviously, the Capitol is not too happy with Katniss and how she has become the poster child for rebellion.<br /><br />There is a sort of love triangle between Peeta, Katniss, and Gale. Peeta is a genuinely good person who would do anything for Katniss. I loved him in the first book, but I love him even more in this book. He obviously loves Katniss, but with everything that is going on, she is not looking for romance. Gale, Katniss' long time friend, has a slightly larger role in this book. I really like Gale more than Peeta even though we do not get to see much of him. I feel like he is a better choice for Katniss in the end.<br /><br />The only thing I did not like was the huge cliffhanger ending, but I still loved this book. I really want to know what happens!
0385341679|5.0|In the process of reading the fever series and having one heart stopping cliff hanger after another I almost got to the point screaming in frustration to many times to count.  There are so many questions that needed to be answered and a great many of them were indeed answered in this book. I was despairing of what kind of HEA it could possibly have after reading the first chapter......that being said don't give up after you read it(chapter 1). Things will make sense and the rewards will be worth it in the end. It was a emotional roller coaster that was well worth the ride.
0307396789|3.0|I decided to read Atonement because I knew there was a movie, and I like reading books and watching the movie versions of them. Unfortunately, I could not get into the book for a good part of it. I thought many parts were slow and boring. It took me a while just to finish the book. I just did not feel drawn to the characters. I will say that Atonement is beautifully written. Ian McEwan no doubt knows how to write, but unfortunately the writing could not save this story for me. For most of the book, I could not stand Briony. I thought she was annoying, and I hated how she ruined her sister Cecilia and Robbie's lives.    What saved this book for me was the ending, and it is not a happy one. Briony knows what she did is wrong, but sometimes you cannot take back what you said. Sometimes there is nothing you can do but live with the consequences.
1594202842|1.0|Amy got the credit telling the true story and her true thoughts. But reading this book makes me feel unsettling. Amy is a 'Tiger Mother' + Control Freak. The book is about a Tiger Mother's way to raise kids, it has nothing to do with Chinese mothers. From the way she talks about others - 'American moms', her in-laws, her daughters' friends, etc.., I felt she has no respect to others including her kids.<br />I regret that I bought this book. PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS BOOK, unless you want to learn how to make your kids run away from home and never talk to you.
0439023513|5.0|Mockingjay was an extraordinary end to a series. I absolutely loved it! It was completely unpredictable to me because nothing that I thought would happen did. I had no idea where Suzanne Collins was going to take Katniss in this book, which made it all the more exciting to read.    When I first received my copy of Mockingjay in the mail, I was literally shaking because I was so excited to read it! I immediately started to read it the moment it was in my hands, and I could not put it down for anything but an emergency (which is in fact why I did not read it in a day, but everything is okay now). It was definitely the most anticipated book for me this year.    Mockingjay started off in the most gruesome way with Katniss walking around District 12. It was definitely not a happy beginning, but how could it be with the way Catching Fire ended. Everyone that survived District 12 is now living in District 13, but District 13 has its own problems. In fact, it is not as great as it sounded in the previous books. I would even go as far as to say that it is as bad as the Capital. The head honcho there, Coin, may seem like she wants to overthrow the Capital to get rid of President Snow's horrible ways, but I think that she is as bad as Snow. She likes power, and power is what she wants.    President Snow is probably one of the most evil villains I have ever read about in a book.He enjoys messing with Katniss' head, so he is still as evil as ever in Mockingjay. One detail I was looking forward to was why Snow's breathe smells like blood. The reason was fascinating and further displays Snow's evilness. I would have never guessed it.    I felt really bad for Peeta in this book. What happened to him was horrible. It was awful to read about, especially when Peeta was always such an all around good guy in the previous books. I would never wish it on anybody, but it further shows what Snow and the Capital are capable of.    It seems like many of the characters changed in Mockingjay, but with what they have gone through it is understandable. Katniss and Finnick are both mentally unstable. Katniss constantly pushes away everyone who loves her and wants to help her. Gale really opens up in this book, and I discovered that Katniss and Gale are extremely similar to each other especially when it comes to violence and anger. I like how Gale is extremely observant of Katniss and how they can speak to each other without actually talking. They know each other so well, but I think that is because they are so alike.    From the beginning, I kept thinking who is going to die in this book. Believe me when I say, many people do. Some of the deaths definitely hurt. There were so many deaths in this book, and some of them were extremely sad and had me on the verge of tears.    Mockingjay was a superb book. I loved everything about it. It was definitely an addicting page turner that I could not put down. I would plan on reading only one more chapter, but ended up reading three more before I even realized it. Suzanne Collins is an amazingly talented writer. The way she writes had me on the edge of my seat while I read. It was so exciting and unpredictable with a few OMG! moments.
0425166805|3.0|Mr. von D&auml;niken makes a compelling case for intelligent influence (or interference) in the development of mankind.  He has clearly devoted his life to unearthing and interpreting a specific genre of evidence with an open mind.  Understandably, he's taken criticism from the mainstream scientific and archeological communities over his interpretation of ancient objects.  Unfortunately, he also uses his book to vociferously defend himself, cutting them down severely in the process, which detracts immensely from the content.<br />I bought this book because I have been watching the TV series \\"Ancient Aliens\\" and hoped to learn more.  But in its original format, with the original photographs, \\"Chariots of the Gods\\" added nothing new for me.  Mr. von D&auml;niken has a rambling writing style and his colorful, original metaphors are worth the read alone.  I believe that his work, along with that of others, is important in bringing us to reconsider the evidence for long ago events.  This book is best seen as the foundation for that line of investigation.
1423113497|3.0|The first book in the Percy Jackson & The Olympians series, The Lightning Thief, was definitely a fun and easy read. Rick Riordan definitely came up with an interesting story line. I thought it was clever that demigods are dyslexic and have ADHD because they are programmed to read ancient Greek and fight. I liked the idea of the Greek gods being located in the western hemisphere. I thought it was clever how Riordan incorporated Greek gods into the modern world. I especially liked when he had the main characters visit places that I have been to (like the Gateway Arch, Vegas, and Los Angeles). The Lightning Thief is certainly a great start to a series. At times I was a little bored because I could not get into the story, but I will not give up on this series. If want something fun to read, then I definitely recommend it. I think that 8-12 year olds will enjoy it a great deal.
B004AG55S2|2.0|Well,it misses over 4 minutes,which are probably the only interesting ones,given you buy this item  for the gore.<br />The movie itself is not that bad,but still somehow overlong and not really entertaining.It's worth a look though.<br />Uncut running time is 99.24 minutes by the way.
0446567337|3.0|Dear John is a beautiful story all around. Like other books by Nicholas Sparks, there is no happy ending for John and Savannah.    When I first started reading Dear John, I had low expectations. I saw the movie before I read the book, and I honestly did not like the movie. I hated how it ended. I didn't like how some things just didn't add up in the movie, so of course I had to go out and buy the book to see what really happened and what was going on in the heads of the characters.    The book was an easy read. It is told in John's point of view and is split into three parts. I found myself immersed in John's life. I fell a little bit in love with John. When he was hurting, I found myself wishing I could comfort him. Unlike the movie, the book gave me insight to why Savannah did what she did, and I didn't hate her like I did in the second half of the movie. Even though Savannah and John do not end up together (as you find out in the first pages of the book), I found this to be one of the best love stories I've ever read. I loved the decision that John made in the end! Although it did not give him his happy ending, it made the person he loves happy.    One of the things I did not like were the 'war' scenes. Maybe it is just me, but I find reading about war boring. Those few 'war' scenes had me putting down the book for a while. Other than that, a great read that I would recommend to anyone!
0553805371|1.0|Sure, these are two very knowledgeable scientists and the book is full of current science which, I gather from reviews by knowledgeable scientists and others, is well (and perhaps better) covered in other books. Where the book is facile and ill-informed is in two areas, in my view.<br /><br />First, the authors have only a superficial and strangely (for this day and age) narrow Western view of ancient and profound teachings (e.g. Taoism, Tibetan Buddhism, etc.) and their views of the origin and nature of reality and the world in which we live. Too bad as there are striking convergences between many ancient or mystical understandings and where physics today is heading. The arrogance and narrowness demonstrated by the authors patronizing comments on Mayan and other creation myths almost made me put the book down (as did their efforts to be cute with humor).<br /><br />Second, the book is rife with philosophical questions they ignore, possibly because they are ignorant of contemporary philosophy. The questions they are supposedly asking beg for philosophical and linguistic analysis as is the language they use. Even the question of what is reality is as much a question of how we use the word and what it means, or what its many meanings might be.<br /><br />In sum, it raises wonderful questions and then fails to answer them and instead at the end hurriedly and arrogantly asserts answers. This is science? It certainly is not philosophy, nor is it really very intelligent or even honest.<br /><br />I'm not a scientist or a philosopher, just a reasonably intelligent and thoughtful person.  I certainly expected far more from these gentlemen.  Fortunately many reviewers who say they are scientists feel much the same way and so I still have faith in the intellectual honesty of the scientific community. But not because of this book.
0547258305|5.0|I loved this book! The world that Kristin Cashore created is amazing, and the added map at the beginning was a nice touch. I loved the characters. The plot was amazing. I loved everything about this book. I was hooked from the very beginning and never grew tired of reading this book. In fact, I could not put it down!    The main character, Katsa is a strong woman from the very beginning. I love that she thinks for herself even when her uncle, the king, seems to control her. I am so glad she broke free of him after she grows into herself a bit more, and realizes that she is not a killing machine. I loved watching her gain more self-esteem as she got to know Po. Katsa is flawed, but that is just a part of what makes her so great.  Some other reviews that I have read of Graceling mention that they did not like the fact that Katsa is set against marriage. Personally, I did not have a problem with this. Sure, Katsa is against marriage, but I found this to be understandable because she does not want to be considered \\"property\\" and wants to be able to always make her own decisions. In the world that Kristin created, women seem to be under their husband's rule once married, so it is completely understandable why Katsa never wants to marry. She wants to be her own person and make her own decisions, but that is just my opinion.  That being said, Graceling is a great debut novel by Kristin Cashore. It is an amazing fantasy adventure. There were some twists that I did not see coming at all. I loved that it was not predictable. Did I mention I loved this book?
B003R50FRI|5.0|the best chapters were 5 and 12 for me. but it really was one of the best books i have ever read. a fabulous read that is entertaining but also brilliantly written.
0743454537|4.0|My Sister's Keeper is one of those books that you will either love or hate. I ended up loving it, but I know many people really hate it mostly because of how it ends. I cannot say that I liked the ending because it was extremely sad and will have you crying, but I liked it because it was completely unexpected. I thought the book was heading in one direction, but Jodi Picoult did a complete 180 with the plot. I was surprised and even shocked by what happened. If you read this book, I would keep some tissues nearby.    Although I would classify My Sister's Keeper as a tear-jerker, it is so much more than that. There are many controversial topics that come up that question your morals. It is the kind of book that will make you think and will stay with you long after you finish reading it. Each character contributes to the book in some way as they deal with their problems. I really liked the characters in this book, especially Anna. She was such a strong person for a girl so young. I also really liked her brother, Jesse, even though he is definitely a trouble maker. My least favorite character was the mother, Sara, because she clearly favored one child over the others.    My Sister's Keeper is a great book. Actually, I would even go as far as saying that it is a powerful book. I really enjoyed Jodi Picoult's writing. I was surprised that I actually liked the different point of view's each chapter because it gave the story so many different perspectives. The plot was excellent. I liked being surprised by the ending even though I did end up crying. In my opinion, the book is so much better than the movie. Actually, I think the movie completely messed up the story that Jodi Picoult wrote, so read the book and do not watch the movie.
0312600844|2.0|I rarely read fiction, but this book got such rave reviews I put it on my hold list at my local library.  I ended up with their unabridged audio version as it became available first.  I don't think the narration gets in the way of the book.  So, I can't blame the reader for my conclusion that this book is boring, with uninteresting characters and situations that are unrealistic and tedious.  I rarely give up on a book but I think I'll make an exception in this case and not finish it.  Life is too short to devote more of my time to this less than stellar book. I know lots of dysfunctional families and all of them are more interesting than the characters Franzen created here.
0385341679|5.0|I loved the Fever Series and I'm debating on whether this is my favorite book of them all.  Lots of turns and twists.  Plenty of surprises and answers.  I couldn't stop reading (hard during the week when you have to wake up and go to work the next day...)  That is how great this book was.    Mac always cracks me up.  I really enjoy the character and how she relates to the others in the book.      Plenty of entertainment and laughs. It was great!
B002ZG980U|1.0|This movie wasn't difficult to follow.  It was just slow and boring.  DiCaprio has lost his looks and he seemed like he didn't believe in the story as he looked like he was going to break out laughing at the stupidity of the script.  The other actors performances were just as forced.  Yes, reminded me of the Matrix movies, but at least the first in that series was good science fiction; this one not so much.  This one was unbelievable and had me thinking \\"you GOT to be kidding\\"!  Don't waste your time.  DiCaprio, go back the the indies you were so good in.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was the first book I read on my Kindle, and I have to say I was impressed by both.  The book was fantastic.  The author creates a world in such a way that you are immediately immersed into District Twelve.  I have just finished the book and have ordered the second two, and can't wait to get started.
B004AHNIGM|5.0|I love all the old blues musicians and I am a big fan of the Allman Brothers, but mostly of the Duane Allman era albums. Not that I dislike the current incarnation, its just that I tend to lean towards the early albums when listening. I must also say that I was never a huge fan of Greggs solo albums. But Low Country Blues is hands down a great album. There is not one song that I would consider to be filler. The production on the entire album is outstanding. Each instrument adds as much to the song as Greggs voice. The entire album is laid back with a steady infectious groove. The songs are fairly short and concise, none overstaying their welcome in a too long jam session. Gregs voice fits these songs like he was born to sing them (which, with his voice, he certainly was born to sing the blues). I've seen another review of someone complaining that this was a T bone album with Gregg simply singing on it. The fact of the matter is I don't care who did what or why. This is probably my favorite blues album to be released in the past ten years and these traditional songs have only been elevated by the work of everyone involved on this project.            on a side note, Best Buy is selling this album including a t shirt of Gregg Allmans 1974 tour. It is more expensive than buying just the regular album, but I thought it was a cool addition.
B000GCFO0S|5.0|I purchased this Movie for my grandson and he loved it.  He bought a large TV for Xmas so he could watch Blu-rays    Thank you!
B004IM14RY|1.0|Uhm, the only thing worse than being trapped in a box buried underground...would be being trapped in a box buried underground watching this movie. It was so...and I do mean so lame. I don't want to ruin the plot for you but I will tell you that the title, (wait for it) is the Plot...that's it...besides a lot of yelling....nothing more...nothing less...just buried....I wish I could bury the memory of having wasted 2 hours of my life watching this movie.

B0038M2AZA|5.0|Nothing better to watch for that sense of fulfillment which we don't often experience, and especially unexpected from nonfiction films.[[ASIN:B0038M2AZA Temple Grandin]]
B0041KKYEM|5.0|As one brilliant reviewer put it, this movie stays with you long afterward and that, to me, is the hallmark of an extraordinary experience. I will be dreaming about and thinking about this fantastic movie for days and would happily pay box office prices to see it again.<br />Natalie Portman - an actress I'm not that enamored with - gives the performance of a lifetime as the ballerina who is steadily and rapidly breaking down psychologically. The movie joyfully toys with what is real and what is her illusion and, even though the black swan/white swan concept is somewhat in your face, the twists and surprises kept me guessing as to what was real and what was not. The supporting cast does stellar work, particularly Barbara Hershey as Portman's controlling mother and fading prima ballerina Winona Ryder. But it's the vision and Portman's riveting performance that were so compelling and captivating.<br />I recommend the theater if possible as the experience is so much greater when you find yourself lost in this oft-surreal world. For what it's worth, I saw True Grit and enjoyed it. Black Swan was immensely better. This is one I will surely buy when it comes out on dvd. Highly recommended.

The band is very elegant but can still work with a casual attire.

1594202842|4.0|I didn't read any of the \\"hardcore\\" reviews or comments other than a small blurb in our local paper. I immediately ordered the book. I liked it and based on the idea of \\"all publicity is good,\\" she got \\"spades.\\" I think what has happened based on an article in the NY Times, she has felt the heat. I really don't know why. Most, probably haven't read the book. I understand the Asian culture, I think--really based on Confucianism which is not a religion but a philosophy and the author could easily have referred to it as \\"why\\" her views. I am a Grandpa and very involved with my grandchildren and my two daughgters. They are constantly hearing my views. From observation, American parents simply negotiate and reason with their children mostly. Not a bad thing but has its perils: once you start letting them have opinions, you have to live with them. Ms. Chua wrote a memoir, she didn't write a \\"manual on parenting.\\" I think she's humerous which from her own description of herself, is a good thing. Being a \\"Tiger Parent\\" is not a lot different than I was raised and many of my generation. It had to do with control. My Dad and Mom were great but they didn't log in lots of time asking me what I thought about things or did I want to do something. To me, it is not either or but both and. Personally, I think parenting has much more to do with personality than anything. As somewhat of a hobby, I've tested thousands (adults and kids)with the Myers Briggs Type Indicator and am convinced that Jung had it right, \\"We're born with a particular kind of personalty and there's not much, if anythng we can do about it(Doesn't mean people can't change). Parents need to know this, along with their own approach dictated by their own personalities. I liked this book and am getting copies to my own daughters with the idea, \\"hey, this is a good memoir, and coincidently has some parenting issues to consider. Nothing in our culture is more important than parenting and wherever you can get a little help. Take it and be thankful.

030726999X|2.0|i am continually shocked at the positive praise the three books have received. I agree that Lisbeth is an interesting character. and had mr. Larson lived I feel that with the work of a good editor that these could have been excellent books. But in reality all three books are poorly written.  There are characters that lead no-where. There are pages and pages devoted to useless information such as coffee drinking, and in depth overly detailed of Ikea items purchased etc. The fact that so many women have sex with Mikael and are wiling to share him - because he is just so fantastic sexually is so silly. It seem that Lisbeth is not just a flawed, scarred young woman but also half super human cyborg.Instead of developing her as a character each book builds upon her amazing super powers until she is no longer an interesting viable woman but a super hero! I barely made it through book two because it was so in need of a editor- I felt as though I was reading a rough draft. The fact that so few people are willing to criticize the lack of quality of writing is just mind boggling.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|A great read! At times I could not put this book down.  One part had my heart going boom boom boom.  I have not been this excited about a story in a long time.  Thanks Emma!

0895260131|5.0|25 years ago when khomeini issued his fatwa  calling for the killing of salmon rushdie over a book, satanic verses,  I was quite amused.  \\"Who could call for the death penalty for an author in the 20th century???\\",i asked myself at the time.  Years later the Danish cartoonist were attacked for illustrating less than flattering pictures of the profit, and once again(it was the 21st century now) i thought \\"surely this is just an anomaly\\".  Then came the murder of cleo van gogh, the ongoing oppression of southern sudanese, bombing of churches in iraq and egypt, attacks on hindus in india, etc.  All this was somewhere else so i didnt care.  Then came the brouhaha over south park.  Very trite, you say, compared to the earlier situations mentioned, as south park was just another cartoon.  But it took the islamic fascists/racists attacks on south park to finally bring home to me that the islamic fascists/racists would not stop at anything, until they controlled everything.  This book serves as a wake up call to start defending your freedoms, especially free speech, before it is too late.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|I can't describe how amazing this series is! I remember watching it non stop in middle schcool!  But now I get to really appreciate it even more, because this show was WAY ahead of it's time and it dealt with many real issues that teens go through.... then, now, and in the future! It's so cleverly done!  I HATE the fact that it never came back for a second season, but in a way it's good because it never went downhill like The OC.  I say and PLEA that this series continues as a book series!  Winnie Holzman PLEASE WRITE IT!!!!  I beg of you, because... you see Tino knows this guy who knows this guy that can totally help publish it.
B0046UGSNS|1.0|One-star due to false labeling this film \\"funny/smart/heart-warming\\" when it is truly \\"unfunny/too-'clever'/heart-rending\\"  True, the acting is superb and the writing feels spot-on at many points.  But the plot is soooooooo contrived and the characters are so distorted so as to overshadow the acting and writing.  From my perspective, one can view this film as 'funny' and 'heart-warming' only in a sick/bad/shallow way.  Because the truth of the film is otherwise to experience this film as gross/inauthentic/mean-spirited.  Earns one-star because zero is not an option and because Bening and Moore soldier through with great performances.

B002YVAT72|5.0|The Ion Portable USB turntable is as easy as it gets to record LP's and 45's records into MP3s.  It's sleek looking, although very sensitive to vibration, so it needs to be placed on a solid surface.  Installation is too easy.  You can plug the left/right inputs into the back of your stereo and play records normally or you can create digital songs individually or an entire album side at once with gaps.  There is a USB cable that plugs into your computer.  (Note that if your computer is in another room, as mine is the turntable is very easy to move and set up quickly).<br /><br />The Profile Pro software is one of the easiest to install and learn.  The EZ Vinyl/Tape Converter software creates songs that pop right into your iTunes after a few clicks.  There is no other software on the supplied CD, so editing and erasing clicks and pops does not work here.  You sort of have to guess the beginning and end.  The arm does retract after playing a song and has an easy up/down switch for delicate landing at the beginning of the record.  For editing, there is a free downloadable program called, \\"WavePad Audio Editor\\" (NCH Software) which shows your song on a linear graph enabling you to start and stop anywhere you wish.<br /><br />Some will argue that vinyl sounds better in a stereo system, which is fine, but this enables you to place all your vinyl songs on your iPod or iPhone without having to buy them.  I bought this turntable simply because I had some very rare records I wanted to record and keep safe that are unavailable on the internet.  Thoroughly clean your records first!
1594202842|4.0|A provocative read, in that, Amy sets forth many troubling \\"truths.\\" An ever-increasing majority of Americans are fat, lazy, and less than motivated, and collectively, parents are doing a much poorer job of raising their children, than past generations. I see this, as a person involved in the education of young children, and I worry, \\"what is to become\\" of our children, and our \\"western\\" education system. To state that it needs a MAJOR (Major !!!)overhaul, is a pathetic understatement. That said, I felt Amy's method was pure poison. There is much to be said for rigor, expectation, and dogged determination. Yet, Amy's poisonous brow-beating, and melodramatic belittling, was always geared toward her personal achievement and satisfaction. Her professed love of her children and their best interests, often had the backdrop of increasing her self-esteem, her achievement, and her reward. Lulu is very astute in her measure of her mother, in saying that their lifestyle was all about Amy.   My curiosity is this. Why does Amy live in this country? Why does she not return to a culture and life, similar to the one she came from, so that she can continue to be screamed at, berated and belittled \\"for her own improvement?\\"  One perspective is that she could use, herself, a great deal of improvement. Why should she fight to promote her high pearls among the (mostly) swine of the U.S ? Would it not be better for her to continue her method, in a setting where this is prized?  The measure of a true innovator, is one who can see the falterings of a culture, and work tirelessly to institute meaningful, measurable change, which can bring widespread ripples of improvement, for that culture. Amy is good at finger-pointing, abusing, and instilling hatred. That is what she does best. There is much to be said for humility, of which Amy has little.I think her children will grow up to \\"love\\" her. Children of abusive circumstances, choose to remain within the abusive situation, because it is whatthey know. They often become perpetrators of the same. I would like to read Sophia's and Lulu's books, written when they are in their 30's...

030746363X|5.0|Ferris has written a manifesto.  I, too, believe the medical profession is 20 years behind re: supplements.  Ferris has simply attempted to \\"hack\\" the body like a computer, and called on the best people in each field to help him do it.  Negative readers are calling for more \\"scientific method\\" or \\"white paper analysis\\", but readable and understandable stats are presented, otherwise it wouldn't be a book - it would be a boring published paper.  The book is supposed to be controversial and against the grain.    I've been two weeks on his quick muscle building program, and I look better now than I have in the previous five years - and I go to the gym two to three times a week.  My wife has started the kettleball swing, and her results are wonderful.  Pick and chose what you want to work on.  Think about all the info/case studies compiled and tested in the book vs the cost of the book.  And a few readers think they got misled and cheated?      There's a difference between talking about football, and playing football.  Buy this book and get in the game.

B0039208JE|5.0|Amazing that Keaton could pass for Batman, good production, epic Soundtrack from Prince and Elfman... before seeing this I could see any one besides Caesar Romero as the Joker, then Nicholson, the Mark Hamil from the Animated, now it's tough not to think of Heath Ledger's performance... BTW I'm watching on Netflix ... Riddle me this, why does Vale go out of her way to save a bowl of popcorn ? And why is it on her fireplace to begin with? Then she throws it in a panic anyway!
B003O85W3A|5.0|It starts with a deceptively simple sounding song but soon it floats into a haunting, dream-like chorus. After multiple listens, tiny details emerge revealing that there is a lot going on beneath the surface of the music, indeed this is one of the themes explored within the album. \\"At night the feelings swim to the surface.\\" Small, suburban towns that appear grey and bleak at a glance conceal another world, take a closer look across the green lawns and faceless houses, something sits in the dirt and shines like a shard of broken glass, glinting. In the suburbs, past the wood-polished floors and vacuous lives, past the animal bones and yellow flowers and into the sunlight, there is a tiny glimmer of something like hope.<br /><br />The listener is invited to \\"Grab your mother's keys, we're leaving...\\" and (to me at least) the journey through The Suburbs does feel like driving a stolen car through empty streets, surrounded by grey neighbourhoods, in a town with shuttered windows and swaying trees, slowly engulfed in sweeping whirlwinds of decayed leaves. On many of the tracks there is a huge swirling sound that moves through the songs like a living thing and makes you wonder, what is that sound, what does it represent? Empty Rooms has the sound almost as a constant, whilst during Ready To Start it appears then disappears, only to reappear near the end, a lonely sound, like wind through trees on a hot, July afternoon.<br /><br />Modern Man, with its almost rockabilly sensiblity, features strange, subtle, off-kilter rhythms and builds to a beautiful guitar led climax, it sounds so simple yet there are many complex harmonics at play and some wonderful ghost-like chords that seem to float and glide, almost in the background but if you listen closely, they can be heard throughout the song.<br /><br />Amidst what sounds like banks of synthesizers, we are informed of someone (the eternal outsider) being told to \\"Quit these pretentious things and just punch the clock...\\" during the euphoric Sprawl Part II (Mountains Beyond Mountains) and yet, beneath its dark, electronic surface, Sprawl is joyfuly defiant in its celebration of life, clear in the line, \\"We rode our bikes to the nearest park, sat under the swings and kissed in the dark.\\" There is also a call for peace here, a yearning amongst the garish shopping malls, the security cameras and busy city streets. A yearning for cool, quiet nights, a place far away from the shimmering neon lights, for a room where the wind blows a curtain through an open window and the moon sits remote in a pitch black sky, a need for darkness and the serenity found in solitude because sometimes the loneliness is not aching, sometimes it is a wonderful bliss where feelings really can \\"swim to the surface.\\"<br /><br />The Suburbs is a definite slow burner but repeated listens are rewarding (and essential) on an album so panoramic in scope, so colourful and deep, like looking at woodland at midnight with the wind swirling around you and ahead, all you can see, are mountains beyond mountains.Part II (Mountains Beyond Mountains) and yet, beneath its dark, electronic surface, Sprawl is joyfuly defiant in its celebration of life, clear in the line, \\"We rode our bikes to the nearest park, sat under the swings and kissed in the dark.\\" There is also a call for peace here, a yearning amongst the garish shopping malls, the security cameras and busy city streets.

B002SQ364Q|5.0|Taking Woodstock is one of the most tender, funny films I have seen in many moons.  Great performances.  Liev Schreiber's performance is one of the most memorable.  We laughed so hard we had to watch it again to catch all the dialogue.    Two thumbs way up!
B002EWD0I6|3.0|I'm only on the first disc but I KNOW this is my cup of tea.  It's very slow and somewhat predictable but I enjoy that sort of thing and after all we read and watch movies to escape so who cares.  Get a good cup of tea and relax - life is short and it's lovely to have some non-violent escapism once in a while.  The acting is excellent.
B000001H00|5.0|Simply, one of the greatest performances of all time. Nobody plays the great third sonata fugue as monumentally as this. Absolutely puts to shame any of the so-called \\"period practice\\" performances of this incomparable music.    Grab this one and be glad you did!    Thank God there was Nathan Milstein!
B004GNYGTI|2.0|* She will be the only survivor when a bomb blasts near by.   * She can jump from truck's rooftop to another trucks rooftop that to on another bridge passing under.   * She can jump into ice-cold water with little cloths and will never have hyperthermia.   * She does not need elevator cabin to go down, she can just hop around like a lizard inside the elevator well.   best of all...   * She can extract 2ml of spider venom from a single spider which is a size of black widow (they are small spiders) using a syringe.   the list goes on n on.     dumb movie.
B000A2WF3S|5.0|This one ranks right up there with the great Nathan Milstein DGG performance. Absolutely astonishing playing! I didn't doze through this one the way I did with recent period performance purchases by Rachel Podger and John Holloway on baroque violins.

B001QWBM62|1.0|I have owned a few of these H4n and for the audio project work I do they are just brillant and I am very happy...    My current  Zoom H4n is serial no..0007461 software version 1.72 and boot 1:01    But recently a VERY strange error has occurred...and it repeats VERY frequently and is very annoying...    During powering up and switching the recorder on to record and also when the Menu is selected and required on the screen VOLUME 100% just appears and the H4n automatically adjusts the H4n speaker volume up to 100% and blocks access to the menu item and the record controls ....    And if I try to adjust it down to any setting say 45% or anything under 100% it just adjust it self back up to 100% ....and locks the screen ............................k bugger
B002VX0A40|5.0|Lamaze toys are the gold standard for appeal, safety, and just plain fun for babies and young children.  When this was opened on Christmas morning, the 4 month old that I bought it for would have nothing else!  It crinkles when they pinch or chew on the wings, and there are plenty of places for chubby fingers to grip on the dragon.  Love Lamaze, and we are never disappointed in the quality.
032147404X|5.0|I cannot praise this series of books enough. I have spent a small fortune on photography books searching for information on every aspect of digital photography and each has let me down, merely repeating the same basic rhetoric. This series has finally explained everything I've wanted to know, being both concise and detailed with images to support each point. I wish I would have started with this set of volumes long ago.
B002L3RVCY|3.0|Great serries but one thing I really dislike is a cliff hanger. Thanks to who ever wrote the last script. They couldn't just say pick up and watch this movie to continue were you left off? Really that was to hard and difficult for the makers of the serries.
B00338QENI|5.0|This is a well-written, science-focused but not too scientific, thought-provoking but not emotional, darn good story.  I will be recommending this to everyone!  Read it.
0679746323|5.0|Glancing through the various reviews of this book, it's interesting that many of the negative comments come from Chinese reviewers.  This is understandable and even predictable.  To this day, Mao Tse-tung is revered as the Father of modern China and from birth Chinese children are indoctrinated with a pro-Mao agenda that portrays the man as some sort of champion for the people despite a sea of evidence (apart from Chang and Halliday's work) that argues that he was anything but.  Looking at history through a bent lens, as the Chinese do, is not unprecedented.  Even in the United States we ignore or gloss over many inconvenient truths about our history: slavery, the annihilation of Native Americans, Forefathers like Washington and Jefferson being slave owners, etc.    If Chang and Halliday are to be criticized, it is for the unusual, and at times unseemly, amount of vitriolic opinion inserted between the facts presented.  As a rule of thumb, authors of magisterial volumes typically go to great lengths to let facts and quantitative evidence speak for itself while opinion, emotion, and other qualitative assertions are painstakingly avoided.  Not so with Chang and Halliday.  What is perhaps most interesting about the dynamics of this book is that laymen and general history enthusiasts tend to enjoy the book precisely BECAUSE of the emotion and feeling that the authors employ.  In essence, it gives the book more of a personal feel and makes it a more interesting read.  On the other hand, scholars and academics tend to despise and chastise Chang and Halliday for precisely this reason.    One thing cannot be denied: even for Mao apologists, 70 million deaths in little more than 26 years cannot be brushed aside as coincidence or \\"largely out of Mao's control.\\"  38 million starvations in less than five years during the Great Leap was not solely due to famine.  The United States suffered an equally devastating famine during the Great Depression's Dust Bowl and didn't have even1% of the starvation fatalities that Chinese peasants endured during Mao's Great Leap Forward.    Another thing that cannot be denied is the existence of Mao's personality cult and \\"Mao Tse-tung Thought.\\"  Mao's Little Red Book, along with his purges and self-criticisms that began wholesale during the Yenan Terror years, spells out that he was indeed a totalitarian dictator that relied on complete subservience from everyone.  As for the Cultural Revolution and Great Purge, there is truly no reason to question Chang and Halliday's facts as most everything they present is well established.    As a whole, Mao: The Unknown Story comes across as a very fair and reasonable assessment.  If Hitler is despised and reviled as one of histories greatest villains (which is accurate) for murdering 6 million Jews during the Holocaust, how could it possibly be that Mao wasn't an equal or worse villain when more than 70 million of his own people perished?!  Arithmetic tells us that Mao killed more than 11 times as many people as did Hitler.  That speaks for itself.

B003X2O6KW|4.0|January 23rd, 2011<br /><br />This just might be Kanye's strongest album. I'm not really saying that everyone will like it, even Kanye fans, but honestly this album goes pretty hard.<br /><br />Strong lyrics in a Kanye song? Since when? He usually can come up with clever lines in some of his songs and hot beats, but one listen to this album and you will know Mr. Omari West has come a long, long way.<br /><br />It doesn't hold back. The words in these songs are a bit on the negative side and darker, but the beats are so hard and the guest spots are so strong, you won't care that much.<br /><br />Best Beat: So Appalled<br /><br />Best Lyrics: Monster/So Appalled<br /><br />Most Descriptive: Blame Game<br /><br />Best Song: Monster?<br /><br />It's really hard to pick a best song, but all the people in \\"Monster\\" go pretty hard especially Kanye and Nicki. I've more or less liked all of Kanye's albums minus most of 2008's [[ASIN:B001FBIPFA 808s & Heartbreak]] and have owned his 2 first albums but this one is something else. People are going to say it's overrated naturally but that speak always comes with decent popular albums.<br /><br />When I come into a Kanye album, I expect really good soul based beats, OK but clever lyrics with a smart ass approach. This album doesn't have many soul-based beats but the production is still strong throughout. As long as you don't mind very racy lyrics (it's rap, why would you care?), solid beats and some realism thrown into the mix, you should come out liking at least a few of these tracks.<br /><br />\\"B\\", 4.25 stars (or an 8.5/10).<br /><br />DOWNLOAD:<br />\\"Monster\\"<br />\\"So Appalled\\"<br />\\"Devil In A New Dress\\" &<br />\\"Power\\"<br /><br />SKIP:<br />\\"Who Will Survive In America\\" &<br />\\"Lost In The World\\"
