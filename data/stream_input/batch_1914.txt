1419705849|5.0|My grandson loves these books, nice hardback edition.  I have purchased this series for the past three years and he looks forward to them every Christmas.
B003L77FYS|4.0|i watch several different crime dramas and each has it's own unique property. with Castle it has all the elements of a good drama with just the right amount of comedy. i also enjoy the dynamic between the characters.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|A hard hitting well scripted and acted video that show how important Dads are to a family.  A movie that every man should see.
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|Not a movie for young kids, Lots of adult content and language. Also a few drug references throughout the movie
B008YWY0HK|5.0|My daughter has watched this with the whole family, with each individual member of the family and alone.  She just loves it.  The film has something to chuckle about for all ages.  Can't go wrong wit this.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|Patricia Cornwell continues to keep me intrigued to the very end. I enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone whom likes suspense.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Just discovered this site. It is easy to get lost for hours, there is something for everyone. I thank my daughter for showing it to me.
B004SIP6C2|1.0|The film is a terrible adaptation of the book, which I loved. It didn't even seem like the same story. I don't normally feel very strongly about films adapted from books, but this film so violated a wonderful book that I actually got angry that I purchased the DVD.
B005H29GSI|5.0|My family is what I would call an angry birds house. When these started popping up in the local big box store, my kids would constantly ask if we could get one. I always resisted because they were 20 dollars and up in the stores. When Christmas time came and these were on sale through amazon I gave in and bought them. They loved them and I find them setting up new &#34;levels&#34; almost everyday. It is a bit challenge but very fun.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is a wonderful book that you will not want to put down.<br /> I wish there would be a part 2 to this book it was great.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I liked it so much and had to read it before I would rent the movie based on the book.  I actually loved the book more than the movie, but it was nice when I reread it to put faces to those characters.
B005ES131S|5.0|Have been wearing these for quite awhile.  Great for people who are on their feet alot.  I had to send back my first pair to get a smaller size (I would say they run big).  Love the vents all around shoe.  No problem wearing with light tp medium thickness socks.  I even wear them now in the winter months; we don't get snow here.  When rain is predicted, I wear my tennis shoes, and I can't wait until it clears up so I can go back to my Crocs.  Crocs are a bit pricey, but they always have been.  Still would recommend, especially if you're on your feet alot.
B005OOL1IC|4.0|Another crazy movie for a good laugh.  It was a little more raunchy than I like, but it was still a hillarious comedy that we like to watch on a stay home move night.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|I was hoping it would be funnier. It was enjoyable and all the pop culture references were cute. Also the special effects were good. But there were lots of predictable stuff and Depp was too droll for my taste.
0671449028|1.0|I really don't understand the appeal of this book. It's too short and the sequence of the story is weird...the animals all brush their teeth to get ready for bed then they go exercise! Who does that? I can imagine getting an older kid all riled up talking about that. The book is also way to short. I have to read it 3 or 4 times to calm my 8 month old down for bed.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|It's dark, but there is light too! Overall the movie delivers as we come to expect from Bale and Nolan. We get the infallible hero taken down a peg or two, only to surface as the underdog. There were a couple of small surprises and 1 medium-sized surprise, which was nice. Action, special effects and gadgets are make it worthwhile to see.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is awsome. this is the best game I ever played don't. change. a thing but u would make the train go faster and make the avert jump higher
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|I enjoyed seeing Steve Carell as the &#34;straight&#34; man and Jones as the one pulling more laughs. Streep does well, as usual. There were parts that were awkward, but overall a refreshing romantic comedy. The end seemed to come quickly and neatly w/ a bow--it wrapped up so perfectly after many false starts and failures.
B005HSL626|4.0|I got this game for my kids, but I like to play it once in awhile. It's very challenging and fun to play.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|There's action and suprises. While I didn't find the story line riveting, it does what action movies are meant to do: entertain.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  It was not what I expected.  The first 100 pages were about his exploring different religions.  I thought I would never get to the prt with the tiger.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|On the top floor of a massive underground silo, a screen shows the view from a camera mounted outside. There's not much to see most of the time, just a gray wasteland and the occasional tornado. There's a hill, too, scattered with what at first glance you might think are rocks. They're not. You see, someone needs to keep the camera and the other sensors on the outside of the silo dome clean. Since the world is so toxic, those found guilty of serious crimes get the job. Occasionally, someone even volunteers. The protective suits they are given always fail once the cleaning is done and they start up the hill. Everyone insists before going through the airlock that they won't clean, but in the end they always do. Nobody knows why.<br /><br />Even small children know not to talk about the outside. The silo is not just the center of the world, it is the world entire, from the Mayor's office on the top floor to the IT department on level thirty-four, all the way down the spiraling stairs past gardens and residences and infirmaries to the Mechanical floors in the down deep. It's a thriving society, one where most people live happily and productively. Ignorance is bliss, after all.<br /><br />The silo has secrets known only to a select few. Finding out those secrets is a good way to get yourself sent out for a cleaning.<br /><br />Howey builds a believable world, populated with compelling characters. His writing draws the reader in immediately, and the plot makes it difficult to not tear through the whole thing in a single sitting. My only quibble, and it's a minor one, is that a couple of places seem to change location between books. Other than that, this is a fantastic read and I can't wait to get the sequels!
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|This movie plays like a Philip K Dick story. Its set in a dark dystopian future and the main character has to make deep decisions between selfish or selfless behavior.
0596004966|5.0|I use it often, i'm not an individual blessed with an eidetic memory so I rely on this to help me with syntax I might not use often. Cheap and useful.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The worst thing about this book is the title.  &#34;Wool&#34;?  What kind of a name is that?  And I admit, I avoided reading this book because of the name.<br />But now, I get it.  Which brings me to the best of the book:  Everything else!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|A very simple game that's good for passing a few minutes here and there. Simple intuitive design. Works great on the kindle fire hd!
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|To many pop up adds when youare trying to play the game an this game I payed money for an don't like adds
B008ALAHA4|5.0|I love how it sticks to your connector stronger than the actual connector. I would totally recommend this if you have a second charger that's the magsafe
B001P3SA94|5.0|I was very happy with this product. the price was awesome and seeing as i couldn't find this in any stores, this product is what made me check with amazon first before anywhere else.
B007SGM084|4.0|The book trilogy arrived on the kindle when expected, as a gift for a friend.  No issues with receiving, and my friend is enjoying reading the books.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|This is the best show on TV.  The characters are so real and you develop a love-hate relationship with a lot of them, just as in real life.
B009E3EY38|5.0|I have to say I wasnt expecting an awful lot when I ordered this....I am a huge Led Zeppelin fan for the past 30 years but there are very few recordings of them and most of them arent that good  ie.  Live Aid, 1988 Atlantic Anniversary, Song Remains the Same and a few others.  Led Zeppelin sounded great in this despite the crappy editing etc.<br /><br />Ive seen Jason Bonham w/ Foreigner a few times and have met him too....man he did an awesome job.  WOWWWW<br /><br />Jimmmy Page was a lil sloppy and improvised a bit...mainly because it sounds like they tuned lower to compensate for Plants voice and I imagine Jimi recreated new versions all of the solos.<br /><br />Robert Plant sounds better than I have heard him in over 30 years...  he stuck to the Led Zeppelin basic roots.... I loved it.<br /><br />Little credit is ever given to John Paul Jones....  Led Zeppelin music is not the same without him, thats how valuable he is.  Ive seen Plant & Page (without Bonham and Jones) in concert before....yes they sounded great, but they didnt put on the same performance 0r produce the same sound as you get here..<br /><br />A must have for all...  You wont get better.  This is the reason why Led Zeppelin have sold over 300 million records.  Unfortunately they dont need to tour so this is the best you will get
B0058YPG1G|5.0|Well worth the price - this show is incredible and you really relate to the characters.  I will be getting every season..
B0083GQ2A0|5.0|cool movie if you like the typical liam neeson action style movie. this incorporated some nice action with survival etc
B001DJLCRC|5.0|This is the best show on TV.  I am very sad that it will be ending but will get every season on DVD to watch again someday.
B0081KTI0E|5.0|amazon did the right thing and it played smoothly at good level or quality, not as scary as i'd hoped but then again i eat very hot peppers
B0086700CM|5.0|It is fast and fun. You will enjoy yourself. Temple run is the game to play. Happy Nedws Yedar to you all.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Keeps track of power level, shows in tray, no need to go looking for it. Also shows What apps use the most power. Nice graphics too!
B005LAII1C|1.0|Bad movie for kids. I don't care for the language in it. Really not a kids movie. To me it wasn't funny.
0547884591|5.0|I love the book. I haven't finished yet, but I'm definitely putting it to great use. I can tell this book will help with so much.
B0063IH60K|4.0|But I had one on my tablet so I didn't need it. So I took it out. Since I have one already.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This game is really good. It provides hours of fun and there are no faults. The graphics are good, the gameplay is good and the missile upgrades are also good. There is no reason why you shouldn't buy this game except for the price but it is worth the money.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is really a very fun and addictive game but the Amazon downloads will not work on my Pandigital tablet
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|My daughter was thrilled to have it and the service was fantastic on both orders..<br />They will be thrilled to have the video forever now and my daughter even had a t shirt made with Ponyo on it..
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Another wonderful addition to Riordan's resume of action-packed and adventure-filled novels. I couldn't put down any of his other books and this one is no exception. Awesome!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I absolutely adored this book. I read it in like an hour and I've already recommended it to all my friends.
B009B0L324|2.0|AC/DC waited way to long to release a live CD.  Brian's voice is shot beyond repair.  I realize at the time of the recording he was 62 or so but man, 30 years of grinding out those songs have left his voice shot and unable to hit anything but the low notes.  Making it even worse is the band is still playing the notes as they always have and haven't brought it down a note or two to compensate for Brian's vocals.  The energy from the band is still there without a doubt but I'd much rather hear a live CD set fromt he Ballbreaker or Stiff Upper Lip DVD's as it sounded much, much better.  The song selection is getting a big old as others have mentioned and it would be nice to hear something like \\"Who Made Who or Money Talks\\" back in the set.  Aside from that the sound quality is pretty pour as well.  As usual you don't hear a note of Cliff's base and the guitars are turned up enough to drown out everything.  Even Phil's drums sound lost and weak in the mix and don't seem to have as much pop as the other two DVD releases had.  I haven't watched the DVD of this show yet so I'm not sure if the DVD quality is better than than the CD but you certainly can't hide the fact that Brian's voice is broken beyond repair.  Typically you hear the the same tone and the notes played the same from Angus's guitar but in this show he seems to be playing a little off on some of the songs.  I've loved the last three live shows that are out (Donnington, Ballbreaker & Stiff Upper Lip) but in my opinion the quality of this CD is subpar.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing lots of twists and turns I loved the whole book in itself I messed up and read the first the third then this
B005LAII8K|2.0|Why is there no DVD and/or Digital Copy with this release? And no, Ultraviolet doesn't count, nobody uses that and you don't actually get the file to keep on your own computer.<br /><br />Most new release movies are $20-$24 on Blu-Ray with a DVD and Digital Copy. This is just a blu-ray and it's the same price?  What gives?
B00A8ECU24|5.0|:D love this game I am totally addicted bronies forever &lt;3 signings f2f x d f2f Blvd f2f. F f2f bc f h f2f h both grab ghnc
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I have this application on my tablet, phone and desktop.  I can read my books anywhere and know where I left off.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Awesome book. Only Clancy can do it this way. Brilliant the way he uses Jr like his dad did it
B006LR0XLM|5.0|I have tried some other online storage programs but this one is simple.  I use it too keep my desktop, phones and tablets synced.
B000FC1192|5.0|Coraline is a read for all ages. Love this book to pieces. Do not pass this book up. You won't regret it.
0375831002|5.0|I rate Zusak's novel among the best. As \\"Death\\" tells the tale of a family living in Nazi Germany during WWII, the reader sees humanity at its loveliest and at its ugliest. Why? This novel portrays how the POWER OF WORDS are destined to affect individuals and society as whole for better or for worse. It's a story I will never forget and one that has the capability to change our world for the better. Only \\"Death\\" can give deliver such a powerful a perspective. I recommend THE BOOK THIEF, a beautifully written novel with a life-changing message, to everyone living on planet Earth! - Bette Stevens, Maine author/illustrator
B00319ECGU|5.0|Love Clint Eastwoon and Dirty Harry movies. Classics that can't be missed. The collection is great so sat, relaxed and enjoyed.
B008GFI4KY|5.0|I was very happy with how easy it was to order and with how quick my order was filled. Very Happy.
B0063IH60K|1.0|Couldn't play the game for all the ads! Deleted this one after 2 minute because all I got was ads. Never got to the game.
B000A1KY7I|2.0|Wasn't English version as advertised . . . It was instead the English version with subtitles.  I don't know if the English version exists, but maybe you could change how you advertise it.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Love this game.  I like that I can draw my own hero and partner in crime.  Too cute.  Great job guys.
0307720748|5.0|I bought this book because I'm a big fan of Richard Branson and the book didn't disappoint me at all. I had a lot of fun reading about what he had done and his crazy life. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who seek for inspiration to start living a life.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|great, fun cd - has almost an irish vibe to it. each song just as good as the last one
B008LZHA3G|5.0|I  like everything Bob Dylan does.  But I really like this record.  He is the poet of our times.  Word.
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|Not one of Bruce Wilis's finest.  Good action, but hard to follow the storyline as with many time travel narratives.  The ending was too vague for my liking.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was an excellent book.  It kept me guessing the entire time.  I couldn't put it down and then it was so twisted that I was scared to keep reading it for fear of what I was going to find out. But still couldn't quit reading ! You won't regret reading this thriller !
B002N5N4M6|5.0|This is one of my all- time favorite shows! I never get tired of seeing the episodes over and over again.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|absolutely amazing!!!!! Do not pass this book up....it made me laugh and cry. I could not put it down and stayed up til almost 4am to finish it.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This app is great for kids seven to ten!  Lots of fun taking care of your own animals. Have lots of fun collecting,feeding,washing,drying, and playing with your animals! Get this app for free online!
B001GM28HO|5.0|I like Lady Gaga so the CD purchased was as expected.  With many hit songs, this product is a winner.
B0091REZMW|4.0|this is a very interesting game and I'm enjoying it very much and I would recommend it and hopefully they like it as well.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|What's not to love about Taylor Swift?  As I've heard it said - everything she touches turns to gold.  So, this CD is a typical Midas kind of purchase.
B000OBYLVO|5.0|Just a happy, feel good movie. I loved it! Nancy Meyers does such a great job with movies she makes.
B0007LXPBI|5.0|This is the Lindsay Lohan that is adorable and spectacular: playing both Annie and Hallie at summer camp.  My daughter loves this movie and it got her very excited for her first summer away at camp. Cute movie that we've seen many times.  I recommend it.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This TV series is of the highest quality in all areas. The casting and acting is incredible and spot on. The house is amazing and the wardrobes are memorable. You really shouldn't miss this series...really!
B009A9BEHU|4.0|The CD cover was cracked in a couple of places. The contents however was fine. It was a great buy for the price.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Good book to go back and read every now and then.  It's moving but slightly redundant, emotional but a little overly dramatic.  Great characters.
B0001GOH6Q|2.0|I tried watching this, but couldn't get into it. It may be that I was tired the night I started watching it. But, I found it really boring and couldn't keep my eyes open so I turned it off. Eventually I will try watching it again, and maybe change my rating.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|The year is 1972 and Barnabus Collins (Johnny Depp) has returned to his beloved home Collinwood in Collinsport (town named after the Collins family) after being \\"locked in a box for 200 years!\\"<br /><br />As a young man Barnabus rebuffed the advances of Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green) and instead had fallen for Josette du Pres (Bella Heathcote), his soulmate. Feeling rejected by Barnabus, Angelique kills his parents, casts a spell that everyone he loves will die (including Josette who had jumped off a cliff to her death), and cursed Barnabus to be a vampire so he could live with his misery for all eternity. Angelique turned the town against Barnabus whom she has buried in a coffin where he stayed for centuries. Until one day he was discovered by construction workers and awakened.<br /><br />Now back home he has been introduced to his relatives Elizabeth Collins-Stoddard (Michelle Pfieffer), her daughter Carolyn Stoddard (Chloe Grace Moretz), Roger Collins (Jonny Lee Miller), and his son David Collins (Gulliver McGrath). Also residing at Collinwood are Dr. Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter) the live in psychiatrist, & Willie Loomis (Jackie Earl Haley) Barnabus' servant & caretaker of the manor. The newest addition is Victoria Winters née Maggie Evans (Bella Heathcote), David's new governess, to whom Barnabus takes an instant liking.<br /><br />If this isn't enough to peak your interest, throw in Alice Cooper, The Carpenters, and a cameo by Christopher Lee and you have a Tim Burton twist of fun and freakiness you'll never forget.
B000ZBEOF6|4.0|Almost as good as watching it on the big screen. Great picture and wonderful sound. Will purchase other movies from this vendor.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|Got this at for a steal at $3.99. Phillip Phillips is the most original artist American Idol has put out. Glad they found him, and glad I did, too. Looking forward to many more in the future.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love playing whenever things are slow. This game is quick and responsive to rerouting the cards to uncover others. And all for free, save busting though the ads.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this game! My only complaint is the social glitches. It won't let me add my Facebook friends who already have the game.
B008XBHBX2|5.0|Great movie, great writing, great scenes all around 5 star.  I was still scared to put my feet under my blankets
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This game is very fun. I really like playing this out of all my 20 games. This is something everyone needs to try.
B0031RAOVY|4.0|The only problem was it was a gift and the dvd cover was one of those super cheap packaging with the card board-like front. I was a little embarrassed that it seemed somewhat cheap. Though the price was cheap! Im not sure if thats the original packaging sent out by distributers or maybe it was intended for a lower priced sale. Either way I read the movie reviews and it sounds like a good movie.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Play it all the time, love how it is challenging and not so easy you whip through the levels so fast, but easy enough that you don't get too frustrated! I personally like it better than<br /> Angry birds. Go piggies,
0743496736|4.0|Nineteen Minutes is the story of a teenager, Peter Houghton, bullied since his first day of kindergarten.  Over the course of nineteen minutes, he goes on a murderous rampage at his high school, killing ten people (nine students and one teacher) and wounding others.  The novel takes us through various harrowing episodes of abusive bullying in Peter's childhood and shows us the perspectives of a large cast of characters including, to name a few, Peter's mother, the detective, the judge, and the judge's daughter who was once a friend of Peter's but later became one of his tormentors.<br /><br />The novel breaks no new ground, but it does provide an interesting insight into the mind of a bullying victim.  Jodi Piccoult did a commendable job of not painting the murdered victims as martyrs - some (although not all) were vicious, unlikable bullies who were certainly deserving of some punishment, but definitely not murder.  Likewise, Peter had moments of heartbreaking suffering, but there were also times when we were reminded that more than a few of his victims had never abused him at all.<br /><br />Piccoult threw in a twist ending that I thought was unnecessary.  Sure, it was surprising, but I'm not sure what the point was, other than the shock factor.
B00A757EFW|3.0|I like it, don't play it much, joystick is very hard to use in my opinion, very sad it is to full screen. If you<br />Like Parkman get it, I wasn't very impressed though :(
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|This was a very good and funny movie and we enjoyed watching it with our kids.  It does get a little creepy at times so if your kids get scared easily you might want to stay away from this.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|It is very fun, I also love how there is a hint that you ca. Use that doesn't cost money. Coins, or whatever. Have not finished all the levels yet. Very confused on the last one, very fun though!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|A great deal for the money. I just wanted the movies, no bells and whistles, and that's just what I got. Very happy with the purchase!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I will say that I completely enjoyed this book. I only gave it 4 stars because I do feel there could have been a little more character development and relationship development. The male character is a little too manipulative for my taste, but not every character in every book is written for my taste only. So, overall, cute book, easy to read, not too involved.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|it is so EPIC to play the game to make it in real life.you have to make your own prseon then you make your friend. YOU SHUOLD GET IT NOW!!!!!!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm currently on bedrest so pinterest is one of my main sources of entertainment,  the fire app has been an absolute lifesaver, it works incredibly well and is much preferable to just using the site on the browser.

B008MM9630|5.0|Great game for both phone and kindle. Good graphics and easy to play. Nice to have a fantasy game easy to play with my granddaughter.
B002R5QPRI|4.0|I'd never seen this movie when it first came out.  My husband recommended it and it did not disappoint - even though I typically don't like suspense movies.  The Amazon rental experience was easy and movie quality good.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Too repetitive....same thing over and over...I was sick of both of the parents with their BLIND faith!  Just not one of my favoutites!

B000VIELPQ|5.0|I bought this album MANY years after it came out, in a time where screamo dominates the metal scene, unfortunately. I heard Iced Earth on Brutal Legends for the Xbox 360 and instantly knew that I had to try them out. I haven't listened to their other albums, but I can say that this album is up there in my list of favorite albums. It still retains the heaviness of modern metal, while still having righteous guitar solos. If you are a fan of 80s metal and want something that isn't screamo or whatever, take a look into these guys. It is definantly worth more than the price it's being sold for, so grab it while you can.
B00AA7O6QC|4.0|Explosions and Ownage ! Great action scenes through out the movie. I didnt see part 1 but I enioyed part 2. Whats else do I need to say...

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Book has a great love story with adventure. I was glued to this book. I liked that the nook differed from the movie.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved the whole series. I think it ended exactly as it was supposed to. The only thing I would liked to have known was if Gale and Katniss stayed friends or not.
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|Pretty funny to hear some of those things come out of a teddy bears mouth. Had a few real laugh out loud moments. I liked it considerably more than my wife did. More of a guys movie. Some of the parts that I was rolling, I looked over at my wife and she wasn't even smiling. It was funny, glad I watched it.
B007THA4FI|2.0|Being a Harry Potter fan, I kept reading the book in hopes that something would happen.  Alas, it never did.  A slow and boring book.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Has proven to be accurate comparing results to an electronic weather station in my back yard. Easy to navigate and gives results you can depend on. Highly recommend.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved it!! I should have read this series way sooner because now I just can't get enough. This book has so many twists that I wasn't sure what was going to happen. Now it's on to the next one!
B005BGBPBG|5.0|this is such a good movie! watch it. you won't regret it.<br />The story line and ending is perfect. :)

B0077DBZXO|3.0|Not near as good as the other Dreamwork movies. I thought it would be a lot cuter. However, my 2 year old enjoyed it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|one of the best series ever made!<br /><br />Fox can have a fate worse then death for what they did to this program....

B00AFCEIB0|4.0|It is better than I imagined, easy to use and I recommended it to anyone who likes the Google search engine.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Bravo to the developers for creating an original work of art! This is an impressive game as you draw your characters and the tools you need to interact with the game. Graphics are good and game play is smooth. I recommend this game to all ages and anyone who likes to draw.
B006O6F932|5.0|Bigger than expected! Comes with a ton of extra items to help build your Monster House. Very Happy with his purchase!

B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Clancy hits a home run!  Great page turning action and suspense.  Never tedious or boring.  Action moves quickly and keeps you reading till you're done.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie was very funny! My wife and I watched it on new years eve. I thought it was good and she thought it was great! She is usually hard to please when it comes to watching movies. She is way to picky! LOL But we both gave this one 2 thumbs UP! It's very entertaining!
B009E3EWPI|5.0|This is all my husband wanted for Christmas and he got it! Haven't watched the DVD as yet, but we are big Zep fans and have been listening to it since we got it. Wish we could see them in concert!
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Love SOA and got a really good price now I plan to buy Season 5 soon best series out there
B0091LS07E|5.0|This is probably one of Alicia's best albums. Not Even The King, Brand New Me, One Thing, and That's When I Knew are my favorites, but there's not a song on here I don't listen to.
B00AE6SS5O|5.0|Story segments get a little long at times, but games are fun.  Would have been nice if it was narrated like some of your other games.
B008K8U13K|3.0|When many fans heard from Sega that sonic 4 was going to recreate the classic feel of games like Sonic 2, every one got their hopes up. Turns out, we got sonic rush classicified instead.<br /><br />The first disappointment we got was unrealistic gameplay. Sonic can walk up walls WAY TOO EASILY! It's as if he has magnets in his shoes! We were promised classic gameplay, and they gave us a HOMING ATTACK? That ability wasn't introduced until sonic adventure! It also seems that if you let go of the control pad while moving in air, you come to a complete halt! So much for classic gameplay...<br /><br />The second disappointment is levels. Only four zones, and each one is modeled off of another level! Splash hill is green hill, casino street is casino night, lost labyrinth is labyrinth zone, and mad gear is metropolis! The same goes for the bosses, too. None of them are<br /> original!<br /><br />And finally, pricing. This is a game worth three bucks and its original price on wiiware and psnetwork was fifteen! We don't even get the second episode with it! At least I got my copy on sale...<br /><br />So, if you want the best sonic game out there, this is not it... it fun, but the best one out the is Sonic three and knuckles! If you don't get sonic 4, don't worry. You are not missing out in anything.
B000FA5SMK|4.0|I've read quite a few of Grisham and Connelly and was ready for a different main character and a change of pace. John Corey in Plum Island fit the bill.  While I will still read Grisham and Connelly, I will also be looking at some more by Nelson DeMille.
B009T3AHDE|5.0|I have loved watching RobPat act since his Harry Potter days!  He is an awesome actor!  This is one freaky movie...which I found as disturbing as I did fascinating.  It is the story of a really rich Billionaire who goes on a limo ride across a crowded city to get a haircut.  The only disappointing part of the movie is when he leaves the barber shop halfway through his haircut.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|Some movies will leave you breathless and enchant your mind. This is one of them. The cinematography is beautiful. The story is heartbreaking. The Fall is one of those movies you have to own yourself, and your mind constantly wanders back to it every once in awhile.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Love this app. Works great on my Kindle Fire.  Everyone should get one!  Easy to use and lots of fun too!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book has sexy written all over it! It keeps you wanting to read more and more till it's finished.
B006P0FIGU|4.0|I didn't go into this movie with high expectations, which seems like it might be a good thing from what I can gather from other reviewers.<br />I enjoyed it. There's a lot of action, some laughs, and a couple of eye roll moments - one of the women does a couple of dodging fight moves worthy of The Matrix.<br />I've never read the book, so I can't comment on how well it follows that, but the four musketeers are all arrogant, but fun to watch - and you really end up rooting for them!<br /><br />I would recommend this for anyone who likes adventure movies, fans of Logan Lerman (or any of the other actors), history buffs (though I can't speak to how well they stuck to true history), or anyone looking for a movie with a LOT of action and a little bit of romance.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Yes, this is my 4th Mahjong game. My hubby is getting hooked as well. What a great time waster. Think I like this one best, but haven't tried the New Year one yet. Waiting for it to download. Cheers
B000HF6XV8|4.0|I enjoyed this movie; it's been many years since i read the book it is based on, but I didn't feel lost at all while watching it.<br />An orphaned girl is moved from India, to the forbidding English manor her uncle lives in.  She is made to entertain herself and stumbles on a hidden garden and a crippled cousin.<br />This movie is totally safe to watch with young children.<br />My one complaint is that the development of the characters happens so quickly in the movie.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It's not a book, it's a guide for kids going through rough times just like \\"Charlie\\". It gives you a feeling of its okay to be feeling bad right now cause things never stay that way. Not only kids can learn from this book but i think adults too. No one is ever alone, there's people with similar problems so don't worry. Be yourself
B004ZISVWC|5.0|Loved the hunter.  I wish they could have gone deeper into his relationship with the vet. Really wanted to know more about his early years.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book is not for children it says a curse word DAMN. Whoever is a child and has a kindle SHOULD NOT read the book ''Waking Up Married'' because after they would start saying it.
B005LAII8K|5.0|Looper is a SciFi film based on time travel. In 2074, time travel will be invented and immediately outlawed, used only by the most powerful criminal organizations to send people back to be executed without a trace. In 2044, Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a looper, an assassin that executes the targets sent from the future. Eventually, Joe's loop is set to be closed as he encounters an older version of himself sent to be killed. Looper is a mind-bending SciFi film, packed with action and thrills.<br /><br />Looper has a great story. The entire \\"Looper\\" concept is actually intriguing and innovative; assassins with targets from the future, with the fear of one day having your \\"loop closed\\". The first half of the film starts off with a fast pace and plenty of action sequences, while the second half slows down and focuses more on dialogue and story. There are plenty of memorable moments in this film, like Joe and Old Joe's first confrontation, and their confrontation in the diner, along with Old Joe's amazing shootout/escape sequence. Another concept/scene I enjoyed was the \\"what happens to the 2044 you, scars the 2074 you\\"; for example, if a character loses a couple of fingers, the futuristic character also loses them in real time. There are more scenes I really enjoyed, but I rather not spoil the film. The ending of the film was also amazing, and unexpected; again, I won't comment any further to avoid spoilers. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis did an amazing job in this film, they were really able to match their personalities for this film. The music was also great. One of the minor flaws, in my opinion, was the lack of emphasis on the futuristic world; although it does briefly introduce the world, it doesn't create a fully-immersive experience, where you're eyes would often wander to view every detail of the environing. I would've enjoyed a bit more emphasis on the setting, but I understand the budget constraints. Another issue that I should bring up is Joseph Gordon-Levitt' appearance in this film: his appearance is different, most likely to match Bruce Willis (since they play the same character), but did not distract me at all. If you're worried about this, watch a clip or view a screencap (even the cover shows it) before paying.<br /><br />Overall, Looper is an amazing SciFi film, with a intriguing concept and stylish execution. I highly recommend a purchase for SciFi fans, and action fans.<br /><br />Looper has strong blood and violence, and nudity.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This handy little app is great to check the level of your battery.  I find it really convenient to use.
B0027MJU00|3.0|I enjoy how Flynn tells the story through different characters at various time periods, like she does in Gone Girl.

B002SSUQFG|4.0|Overall, the pros outweigh the cons but buyers should beware of the cons.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Unbeatable value for an automatic watch (purchased for $63 in 12/2012).<br />2. Looks great.<br />  a. I love the clean white-on-black face and tick marks for the minutes.<br />  (I thought it might be weird that the hours were inset from the minutes but I find this actually much easier to read.)<br />  b. Love the day and date display. The red font for Sunday makes the Sabbath that much cooler.<br />  c. I love the transparent back.<br />  d. Would not want the more expensive but larger SNZG15 version of this same watch, as I have small-to-average wrists.<br />3. Good quality watch. The materials used are far better than the price might suggest.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Not a great timekeeper. Loses about a minute or two a week. I do not like winding this watch so often.<br />2. Winding rotor is extremely noisy if you move your hand too quickly or at certain angles. Makes the watch seem less like an instrument and more like a toy.<br />3. Canvas strap is not great quality.<br />  a. Feels scratchy against my skin due to loose fibers/threads.<br />  b. After a week of use, is already starting to fuzz/fray at the end.<br />  c. Catches on certain fabrics which can be annoying.<br />  d. Read from other reviews that the strap only lasts about a year. I've already replaced it with a Nato black/gray 18mm strap (see photo in link below).<br />4. Loud ticking can be heard if the watch is held at certain angles.<br />5. WR30M is not ideal as I would love to wear this without worrying about water ruining the watch.<br /><br />Link: http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/permalink/mo2HENROEN0K0FV/B002SSUQFG/ref=cm_ciu_images_pl_link
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The movie stays pretty true to the literature besides the obvious missing details about the capitol and the games. Great read.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|This is a wonderful movie that the whole family can watch without worrying about any objectionable material.  It can be used to help teach young people some ethics, which can only help our future generation.
0670921076|5.0|A wonderful read for anyone who likes a both good mystery and good non-fiction.  Plus, it brings to life a time and a place about which I knew almost nothing . . .  Highly recommended!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|&#34;A Higher Call&#34; : As a retired fighter pilot myself, I was particularly interested in the German fighter pilot's lifestyle during the war.  In one sense he was a killer, but a very compassionate person also.  War and duty usually overrides.
B0063IH60K|5.0|One of the best Solitaire games I have played.  With the stylus the game goes must faster.  Can play all day.
B0086DBE62|4.0|It was a cute movie but somewhat slow. I thought it was going to have a little more action in it.
0345528581|3.0|3.5/5 stars<br />As a catalog of various bodyweight exercises, this is a great book. There are illustrated examples of exercises targeting different muscle groups and variants of each for beginner and advanced levels, i.e., the easy variants targeting those who are starting out and not strong enough to do the actual exercise (like pull ups) and the advanced movements challenge even those who are adept by using leverage and off-balance positions. So not a bad book overall (especially for the price) until you look at the explicit claims made right on the cover and an implicit one conveyed through the title.<br /><br />1. Back cover says \\"For men and women of all athletic abilities\\".<br />In my opinion, bodyweight exercises by their very nature require a certain amount of base fitness. For someone that is overweight or obese, I doubt they can do even a few reps of the easiest variants of the exercises shown, let alone \\"ladders\\" and \\"supersets\\" which feature very early on in the author's 'Basic Program' for beginners. This wouldn't be such an issue if the author were upfront about this. But the author is against cardio of any kind and insists exclusively on his bodyweight program and a paleo/low-carb diet for losing weight. I don't want to get into the whole paleo subject as I think there are multiple ways for people to be healthy depending on their metabolic makeup. As for cardio, perhaps if one is already fit, then it may not be as necessary as the author says but for me personally, I've had success in the past losing weight doing cardio. So I prefer the diet and exercise philosophy in another bodyweight-training book [[ASIN:0938045768 Convict Conditioning: How to Bust Free of All Weakness--Using the Lost Secrets of Supreme Survival Strength]] which is simpler and focuses on eating 3 square meals a day at fixed times and eschewing diets and fancy calculations for calorie and protein intake.<br /><br />2. The implicit 'No Equipment' claim<br />As other reviewers have pointed out, \\"you are your own gym\\" does not mean you do not needs \\"things\\", such as tables, doors, brooms, blocks etc to do the exercises as illustrated in the book. I wish authors in this genre of books recommended something like the [[ASIN:B000M29CCI Body Vision PT600 Power Tower]] with accessories for doing most of the exercises and THEN recommend some variations as options when travelling. If someone is seriously looking to get into shape but does not want an expensive gym membership one could do worse than buying a few dumbbells and a pullup bar instead of using brooms, milk-jugs and stuffed backpacks like the author recommends. It's more of a hassle (and can be actually accident-prone) to concoct these so-called no-gym options then it is to invest in some minimal equipment.<br /><br />3. Progressions and Tempo<br />I think one of the weak points of the book is the whole progression routine for beginners. I wish it was simpler and easier to follow. The intervals, ladders, supersets etc get confusing. Not to mention one has to look at the exercises up by name and connect it to the program listing in the back of the book. In this case again, I found the progressions in 'Convict Conditioning' much more focused, simpler and easier to follow in terms of tempo and sets. Also, while that book focuses on a few compound routines, YAYOG gets into targeting individual body parts such as abs etc exclusively fairly early on ( I like YAYOG's variations for advanced followers such as the exercises targeting calves, shoulders etc). I bought the accompanying iphone app for this book per another reviewer and it makes some of these criticisms go away, but it would be unfair to rate this book on the iphone app's strength. But if you're going to buy this book, spend another 3 bucks and get the iphone app. It makes it this book so much more useful as a reference.<br /><br />All in all, I like this book and I think I'll use it along with 'Convict Conditioning' in building a diet andexercise routine that works for me. I hope with this review, you too have a better understanding of what you're getting.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|I love this book its really entertaining!!! Im glad i bought it it was worth it i will  buy them all i love diary of a wimpy kid

B00AMBLDEE|3.0|Didn't really like the ending.  The movie should have much much much more content.  Previous Bourne movies had much much more action.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|My brother is a huge fan of the Avengers. He was thrilled to finally have it on DVD, and chock-full o' goodies like the Blu-Ray disc and the Digital Download disc for his computer and phone.

B0098VXBIA|1.0|Movie rental time expired before I could watch movie. I must not have been keeping good track of time or it expired in error.
B005GIS1SY|5.0|I thought this movie was really good and of course it was funny as can be for the grown ups as well. Well worth renting for sure.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|I very much enjoyed this movie. I liked this better than some of the other BatMan movies. I would recommend this over some of the other movies.
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|Awesome movie. Great acting, action and story line. Hard to believe it's all a true story. Funny how reality can be so crazy. I would highly recommend this movie.
B0095R64AO|1.0|Movie expired before I watched it. I must not have been paying close enough attention to the time frame of watching. Or it expired pre-maturely.
B009VB7QQA|5.0|Great movie with lots of action and vampires, but no historical value to Lincoln himself. Not really sure why they tried to tie him to this movie but hey to each his own. Worth the rental in my opinion.
B009VB97EY|3.0|I usually watch movies for the sheer entertainment and escape from the day to day grind. Certain parts of this movie I found repugnant and did not like the roles certain actors were playing.
B009SQQRH2|5.0|Great movie for todays kids. Has a lot of ties to todays kids and what they like and do. Funny and entertaining. Worth the rental in my opinion.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|I like the Iron Man movies, therefore I enjoyed this movie. It was just pure entertainment for me and that is what I was looking for.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This is a great game. It moves fairly fast so there is not a lot of waiting for things to replenish. I do wish it was not so hard to get acorns.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|It was entertaining but disturbing. People hunting each other for someone's entertainment. Not a fare that I would enjoy. Would have enjoyed this movie more if the hunters would have turned on those individuals who were seeking the entertainment.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I was bored today and decided to see what Amazon would recommend for me to read and I'm glad that i decided to give this book a chance. I ate up the book in one day I couldn't put it down, I highly recommend this book to anyone that enjoys fantasy!
B009NQKPUW|3.0|This movie was okay for being entertained. I may have to watch it again to see if I may have missed something that I didn't pick up on the first time. I thought the computer generated scenes were very good.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Outstanding! By far one of the best books I have ever had the privilege of reading. I came a wee late to the dinner party that is the Discovery of Witches, but better late than never. I could not put this book down. When I did take a break, it was almost as the book was calling me back.
B009329ZF2|3.0|I watched this all the way through. It is not a movie that I would watch twice. I watch movies for the sheer entertainment of them. The most stupid part of this movie is the part the lead charactor played, to think any navy would have such a naval officer of any rank was the most far fetched part of this movie.
B00A50PE6K|2.0|I was really looking forward to this coming out. I thoroughly (well, with the exception of a song here and there) enjoy the first two volumes. However, this one was such a letdown. It feels like they released the first one especially, and the second one to a lesser extent, with little thought for the future - all the great ideas and songs went out at the same time, without considering what would be left for future volumes. It also feels rushed. For the most part, these songs are traditional and are performed very close to how most versions of them are. There is not much creativity to be found. You will find no \\"Deck the Rooftop\\" here. Nor will you find something like \\"Extraordinary Merry Christmas,\\" because the songs on this third volume have little to no energy. I'm not sure why they haven't touched the Phil Spector songs. Those seem like prime candidates for Glee renditions. Overall, it's a very boring record. This really seems thrown together and is not something I will be playing very often in the coming years.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|I found this movie entertaining and that is what I was looking for with this movie. Would recommend this movie for light easy viewing.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|This is a great app if you own a kindle and you want to do more than just take photos. I only bought the app for the capability of taking videos and sharing them with my family and friend. So in my personal opinion i think this is a must have app for kindle users.
B009RI4FRU|1.0|I thought this movie would have some interest for me when I rented it. I did not even finish watching it, because it just wasn't my kind of movie.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Disturbing in so many levels, your mind will reel, you will be emotionally worn out and I can't even imagine writing this how it will leave you. Flynn has a gift of writing that allows the reader to get in the characters head and it's not all good but its real. Showing the ugly, bad and missed up lives that can easily be our neighbors and even us at one time or another. Libby survived the murder of her family. Her brother accused and sent to prison. The story is told by Libby in present time and the next chapter is told then by what happened that day by her mom, and brother Ben. The chapters alternate. Libby has been asked to find the truth of what really happened and believe me the twist is surprising. One of the strong themes in this book that I felt as I was reading this was Libby and the battle she was fighting. Libby was messed up. She never had any control in her life and thus she was not able to control her life. It's one of those things that make you think about children that come from bad homes and just remain stuck and the hard road they have. Libby did find out what happened to her family and got some control back
0062197266|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It took me a couple chapters to get into the swing of the two timelines/stories, but once I got used to it, I really enjoyed that aspect of the book.  It's almost like reading two books in one -- each story line (in each time period) could almost be a book in itself. Together those stories make for a thrilling read.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I Enjoyed the show very much, hats off to AMC network !! excellent concept and cast. I'm hooked, keep them coming !

1451696191|5.0|The Perks Of Being A Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky<br /><br />This is a book I was given over the Christmas holidays and a book I couldn't put down.<br /><br />This is a coming of age story written in the form of letters from Charlie to an anonymous recipient. It has become a classic of sorts because of its tender storyline that's easy to compare to The Catcher in the Rye. Unlike the Catcher, however, this story includes themes that are perhaps deeper, less idyllic, and confronting.<br /><br />Having said that, Charlie shares Holden's overwhelming sensitivity -- and struggles with psychological issues -- and readers will find themselves quickly feeling sorry for the protagonist and worrying about him throughout his transformative journey.<br /><br />The seemingly simple short letter conceal depth and insight - we learn that Charlie was molested by a family member, which has caused him to become a quiet person without a voice, letting people do what they want to him. He passively witnesses a rape, has a girlfriend he doesn't really like, takes drugs and alcohol others give him, and even lets his grieving gay friend Patrick kiss him just to make Patrick feel better. His passivity is countered by Sam's (a girl Charlie is an unachievable goal) kindness and care. Sam encourages Charlie to form his own opinions, speak his mind, and to show passion about his desires.<br /><br />This touching story end with Charlie's final letter - with feelings of hope: getting released from the hospital, forgiving his aunt Helen for what she did to him, finding new friends during sophomore year, and trying his best not to be a wallflower. Charlie hopes to get out of his head and into the real world.

B004HW7JH4|5.0|Season 5 is the best!<br />It's great to have your own copy in case you missed episodes during the regular season,

B009CPJHY4|4.0|Timely and interesting story for the older US demographic - heartwarming and bittersweet. Kept our interest all the way through.
B003NFM3JK|1.0|Terrible! I purchased brand new/wrapped in original wrapping so it would be nice & the cover was broken and ripped but someone wrapped it in plastic wrap. Very deceiving.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|fell in love with the game at friends house while playing it on her ipad<br />a lot like temple run, but easier<br />I got home and immediately downloaded it on my kindle
0786852550|4.0|This book was given to me by a co-worker and I reluctantly began to read it out of obligation and to get it back to my friend pronto. I had no interest in delving into a young adult fantasy book and demons are not my style. But to my delight, I was completely wowed by The Amulet of Samarkand. The wonderful characters and the fast-paced plot was very nicely written and intriguing enough that I bought the next two books in the trilogy.<br /><br />The main characters are Bartimaeus, a acerbic, wily, wise-cracking dijinn, with a boatload of attitude and twelve year old Nathaniel, a precocious wizard's apprentice bent on revenge after he is publicly humiliated by another young magician. I loved reading the story when it switched to Bartimaeus' first person point of view, I found myself laughing out loud. Jonathan Stroud did a remarkable job of creating a fascinating world of magic with wizards, witches, magicians and dark lord. I look forward to delving into book two, The Golem's Eye.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|The Blu-Ray version is excellent and a pleasure to watch!  Well worth adding to one's collection to watch over the Holidays.
B003EI2EH2|4.0|It all seems a little crazy but makes sense. Tim also provides the science to back it up.  You can also read the book in segments.
B007DIQC90|5.0|Great selection and service. Received my order in less than a week, even during Christmas time! Just what I wanted.
B0061Q13V2|4.0|This is a good read even if you are not/ were not a gymnast :)  The pressure put on her as a little girl is crazy and it really does a good job to describe to you you how the Karolys were.  I thought Bela was a big teddy bear from seeing him on tv as a little girl.  You have to give them credit they produce great gymnasts.
B002FOQY2M|5.0|Thanks, Easy to order and great service even during the Christmas rush! Received my order in less than a week. Thanks!
B004WESFZW|4.0|I saw this movie in theaters and had no idea what to expect.  I was completely blown away with how good it was!  I typically enjoy a Matt Damon movie but this one was good because it catches you off guard!  The story is unique, the acting is fantastic and as a spectator this movie sucks you in and you find yourself rooting for the success of the 2 characters!  Definitely worth buying!
B003YOZNBU|4.0|This is your typical 'comic turned movie' movie. There is not anything abundantly stellar about the flick but it is a good one if you are into the comic book myths.
B001F3FUK6|4.0|This Superman movie was good but not great.  In comparison with all the other Superhero movies that have been released this one is actually (in my opinion) closer to the bottom of the list.  I however, am a big fan of the series and couldn't pass up an opportunity to own this on blu-ray via Amazons used Warehouse option.  Cheap Price + Superman = Happy customer
0345803485|3.0|Since I finished this book in two days, I can easily say I could not put it down. The beginning was my favorite part when they first met. I liked the storyline. I also liked the characters, but I also found myself rolling my eyes alot throughout the book. I know what Ana's bitten lip does to Christian. However he doesn't need to say it in every chapter of the book! Enough already, we get it! If there was a drinking game when every time he tells her to not bite her lip because she knows what it does to him, I would have been too wasted to finish the book. And the \\"not allowing\\" her to roll her eyes, but he is, is a little confusing. I know this is supposed to be an erotic book, and I am no prude, but a little more of \\"them\\" without sex would of been nice. (I did enjoy the sex scenes, of course) I will def be checking out the second one anyway from the library, because even with the \\"eye rollers\\" I still spend my whole day today to finish it. I do recommend the book regardless of the repetitivness (sp?).  Regarding an upcoming movie, when reading this, Ian Somerfolder, or whatever his name is, was in my mind, so I think he would be good for the part, as long as he doesn't do that weird thing with his eyes he always does (another eye roller with that).
030759565X|5.0|Bought this book for a friend as a Christmas gift and really wanted to keep it for myself!  After flipping through the breakfast section of the book my mouth as salivating and my stomach was rumbling!  I did end up giving the book to my friend but she actually made me some of the peach and sour cream pancakes that were in the beginning of the book and they were DELICIOUS!  The author really takes the time to explain step by step, every detail of what to do to make your recipe taste like it should.  I recommend it.
B00004YRQA|5.0|For any one who likes to play games would def want to save the progress.  There is nothing like loosing progress you have made.  So yes every one needs to have a memory card.
B00AC8ZJPQ|5.0|Loved it. I have played all the games, huge halo fan, I couldn't wait for something like this to come out and it didn't disappoint.<br /><br />My wife also enjoyed it which was a huge plus (Surprise! Some Halo nerds are married!). She's not in to Halo at all, but was interested in the story and thoroughly enjoyed the movie.
B009K6DKTS|5.0|Everyone who is interested in risk management should read this book. Concept of anti-fragility - 'if it doesn't kill you it makes you stronger' is a useful addition to the well-known, more static, enterprise risk management methods.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|This is Just as good....if not better...than the original broadway cast recording! You won't be disappointed with this purchase at all.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|Not as good as the first season of AHS, but still pretty awesome.  There aren't many surprises, but the acting is outstanding, and the story is suitably horrifying.  I'm going to be sad when the season is over (I'm on episode 10, so it may be over already).
B0014I4KH6|5.0|I am an &#34;oldies&#34; (Beach Boys, Jan and Dean, etc.).  I never heard a Taylor Swift song, until she appeared on GMA.  Wow, what a great story about a young (and pretty) girl who had a focus on her life.  Glad there are more than C & W cuts to her music.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|What can I say? Great price. Great movie. It's funny, perhaps, but I enjoyed both the original series and this movie!
B003WTE886|5.0|Very good album.  I bought Red and Fearless first;  this one completes the collection.  Taylor Swift is a major talent. and a great role model.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Was sad to see this trilogy end!!!  Couldn't put down the third book either and was happy to see a good ending
0802798225|5.0|Probably the best young adult book I have ever read. I found this book very hard to put down - a most enjoyable read.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|David Mitchell has accomplished in spectacular fashion what few writers could dream of doing. You will be amazed and captivated by separate but inexorably linked stories which you won't believe are written by the same person. Skip the movie, read this book and savor it for all time.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|this app is so much fun I cannot say enough ... really simple idea with an awesome story....you get to draw your own character AND a sidekick thatgets kidnapped...you then get to rescue him or her by drawing fire, rain, keys, and a host of other things that help you on your quest..... it is quite challenging, but not too hard.... I HIGHLY recommend this app and wouldn't want to give the &quot;Hitcents&quot; any ideas but it is WAY under priced!!!!!  Get this app and laugh out loud... no really!!!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This is one of the best mystery games that I have played in awhile .Can't wait to play the next one!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I was not sure about this book at first based on past reviews. I have read and loved the Harry Potter books as well as The Hunger Games and Twilight. This series is similar to those but also different. I found myself hooked after chapter 1 and finished the book in record time. Now on to number two!
B0088X7YU0|3.0|I wish that someone would make a version that is faithful to the book, which I have frequently read since 1960 (including every patrol that I made on two SSBNs). And then there's CGI female nudity, \\"what the hell?\\" as Walter would say. I mean, why?<br />Then Carl says a line right out of DUNE????<br />I do watch the Starship Trooper movies, I love \\" space kickers \\", however, all of them have been an insult to the book and its author .
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|love google, very easy to search for anything that you are looking for.  i would reccommend to anyone that uses a search engine
0062127241|3.0|I have read all the recent Rock Star Bios and Autobios and I had hoped for more from Pete. Although it is evident that he is an extremely intelligent man, guys like me need rock heroes more than self-pitying intellectuals. His lyrics served to define my teenage and early adult years. Quadrophenia gave me strength and inspiration when I was putting my life together. After reading his book, I find out he still doesn't have his life put together. Who feels sorry for you? If you made mistakes with drugs and alcohol and cheating on your wife and viewing child pornography, don't expect everyone to understand your sense of regret. Just be grateful that the ignorant mass of fans you will always have continues to support your work the way I always have.
B009ANP48G|5.0|This flick is echelons beyond You Got Served: Beat the World (2011), eclipses the original You Got Served (2004) and matches all of the Step Up franchise.  This along with the other Step Up movies always leave me feeling satisfied, happy, pumped up and itching to pull a hamstring learning how to slam dance.<br /><br />Miami crew The Mob is trying to drum up 10 million YouTube hits with their filmed flash mob hip hop routines done in public.  Of course they all have crappy jobs, douche-y bosses, and could really use a break.  The movie  is predictably formulaic, but that's okay.  The rebellious crew captain meets a rebellious young lady who, of course, also dances quite well and in a different style.  Finances grow tighter.  Douche bags become douchier.  The love interest becomes complicated by the pressure of a powerful father's (Peter Gallagher) ultimatum.  The girl is challenged to risk everything.  The Mob puts \\"it all\\" on the line.<br /><br />Together Sean (Ryan Guzman in his first movie) and Emily (SYTYCD's Kathryn, who looks a lot like Eliza Dushku) mix his hip hop street savvy with her contemporary style.  Born two worlds apart, but they're one of a kind..yeah, it's that kind of \\"rule-breaking\\" hip flick.  He says things like \\"trust me\\" and \\"meet me here at this time...and wear something nice.\\"  How mysterious and romantic, right?  He wins her romantic passion by introducing her to his life's passion: hip hop flash mobbing.<br /><br />The movie is shot well with vibrant colors bringing Miami to life.  The music is fun.  The dancing is exciting.  The flash mob set ups are cool, too.  I especially enjoyed the art gallery scene, during which many dance and lighting styles were showcased.  Even parkour (freerunning) finds its way into this movie.<br /><br />There's trampoline dancing, devil stick dancing, martial arts dancing, parkour, contemporary, girl crew booty shaking, hip hop, stop-motion robotics, a dash of krump, un poco de salsa...pretty much everything.  Oh, and the best twitchy robot dancer EVER (Vlad from Step Up 3D) makes an appearance in the finale.  Good stuff!  I seriously can't tell if they're modifying the film speed or if he can really move like that.  Jenny Kido and Moose (both from Step Up 2 and Step Up 3D) make appearances, too.  Surprises abound left and right.  And, no.  I didn't ruin anything for you.<br /><br />These actors are nothing amazing, but they don't drown in the sea of clich&eacute;s and destitute writing.  They hold their own just strong enough to keep my attention and earn a few grins as I patiently wait for the next dance scene.  The movie also features So You Think You Can Dance's Twitch (who is wisely given very few lines as Jason) (Step Up 3D, Stomp the Yard 2) and Mia Michaels basically playing herself.<br /><br />This movie is 90 minutes of feel good, stickin'-it-to-the-man fun that reminds me of how exciting life was in my early 20s and late teens.Oh, and the best twitchy robot dancer EVER (Vlad from Step Up 3D) makes an appearance in the finale.

B0097EWK3A|5.0|I'll make this short and sweet it's super fun and makes you want to keep playing... well it's pretty good for a free app
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love that there are so many games! They are addictive! I didn't wanna stop playing. Great game!!!! Would recommend it to friends!
B00866JL96|5.0|Came earlier than expected so that's always nice. No damages to the packaging or any complaints at all. Love this book....love this movie.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|so I have heard alot about this game from my nephew so I downloaded it and I like it so far. I shall continue to play it and see where it goes. my nephew is happy I moved in to the tech games
6305428042|5.0|So glad to finally own this movie! Love watching it on TV and now to watch it whenever I want! I can't complain, I believe it is a Halloween Classic
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is really a fun 'free' game on Kindle Fire!!  Love the bright colors on the screen and music.  Great
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love this game. It is fun and addictive. The game has great graphics and sounds. The only thing is I'm not sure how you're supposed to close the app when you are done. If you like puzzle games I recommend this one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So fun I would buy this game if I had to  it is my life so fun because you never get bored with this game so entertaining
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I found this a most unusual story with great hidden depths. It can be read, I think, on various levels and all would be enjoyable.It appealed to my love for philosophical ideas and metaphor,but would be equally enjoyable as a simple story.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book was an amazing adventure.  Every emotion was explored and every sense  was stirred. I laughed, cried, and cheered.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I dont care for this. But he sure does he sat and watched half one day and half the next. So he liked it...
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I loved this book. It was a tad different than &#34;typical&#34; Grisham books and it was just wonderful. The twists and turns were not contrived and I was cheering at the end.
B0043X1FOK|5.0|This is a great movie I use to watch as a kid. So I thought I should buy it for the whole family...
B009H2PCNC|5.0|The word Lux suggests light, and indeed, this could be sunlight set to music. The four tracks of music on Brian Eno's latest CD (roughly equal in length and appropriately named Lux 1, Lux 2, Lux 3 and Lux 4) suggest, if anything, the movement of early morning sunlight through breeze-blown trees following a pre-dawn rain. As others have noted, this belongs with Eno's corpus of ambient works, and although this is a solo effort the looped, echoing piano sequences recall his collaborations with Harold Budd (especially \\"The Pearl\\"). This CD stands on its own, however: pleasant to listen to, or effective in the background \\"filling the room\\" while the listener does other things. While some doubtless want Eno to move on from the ambient efforts, LUX proves conclusively that the form still has life in it.
B00006F2TV|5.0|He loved it! He lost his old dvd so this made him very happy to watch. It was a surprise!!!
B0079R8IYW|2.0|This cover is good as a cover, but it does not function well as a stand.  It is not stable and is difficult for little hands to control.
B0000UJDLM|5.0|Great movie! I use to love this movie as a child. I got it for my family and they loved it...
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Many aspects of the plot were brilliant!! The ending was somewhat of a letdown...a little contrived,so as, it seems, to open the door to sequels. The writing itself is excellent...well crafted prose with a combination of thoughtful plot twists and action.  While The development of Pendergast as a character interesting and  engaging while<br />a little disturbing. While I'm not sure this was their best, it certainly was difficult to purchase down.
B000W10AEI|5.0|Great movie for the entire family. The series keeps the intrest on going. It would be nice if the next generation of potters had adventures to entertain us too!
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|This is not likely to be on anyone's list of classic films, but if you like sci-fi/time travel movies you'll probably like this one. It doesn't have the sophistication of something like Primer or Timecrimes (the name sucks but the movie is good), but it also doesn't require the kind of attention and scrutiny of those films.<br /><br />In short, perfectly solid, fun movie.
030758836X|2.0|Okay, so by now we're all well aware of the disappointing ending, but the setup in most works of fiction is usually much easier to formulate than a satisfying conclusion.<br />What I find most disturbing about this book is the proposition and reinforcement of the \\"psycho bitch\\" woman.  The husband, Nick, may not have committed murder, but he is, by all accounts, a total prick.  He and his nasty old father, we're told, have both been destroyed by the women in their lives, and both repeatedly think and/or speak their mantra, \\"dumb bitch\\". While our \\"Gone Girl\\", Amy, herself is an extraordinary version of every man's so-called \\"psycho-bitch\\" nightmare, there aren't any other female characters who fare much better.  From Hilary Handy to Able Andie, to Ellen Abbott, the women here are characterized as desperate, needy, calculating and shrill harpies. It seems only the twin Go and the plain Detective Boney - women who behave (and sometimes even look) more like men, are spared the plentifully cliched paint of the same broad brush.<br />Perhaps it would have been a greater challenge, and a far better read, if one final twist proved that Amy was not the monster after all.
B009GED3HS|5.0|How would I rate this season? I'll channel the great Barney Stinson (what does he do anyways), one word, Legend...... Wait for it..... Dary!
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|I have to say that I enjoyed this version a lot more than the Schwarzenegger version, despite the earlier version being closer to the original story. This more recent version's story line moves right along. Excellent action sequences. Superb cinematography. The HD quality of the Amazon download to my Blu-Ray was excellent via cable connection.
B0051HNMTI|5.0|I love this app i mean this app is the greatest because you can fit it any where in your day. during the commercials waiting on something like food ,people and its portable. plus I'm 13 years old and it easy for me so it should be easy for everyone else
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|It was a decent movie worth the watch, but it wasn't as well done as we had expected. Worthy rental if you don't have any other good movies you want to see.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I love this app its so fun challenging in some parts but so so so so fun I wanna part2
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This is a wonderful and addicting game. If you don't beleive me, I'm already level 34 and I've got 3 jetpack.There are a few things I want changed, though. I would like it if the snow machine jetpack shot a flurry of snow instead of just a snowball at a time. I think there should be a create-a-character station, and you can buy pieces in the stash. There should be a gadget that made it so you can pick what vehicle you want from a vehicle block. Lastly, second chances should be able to buy in the shop. If  you are thinking of getting this app, don`t hesitate. Get it now!
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Great rollercoaster of a relationship!  Couldn't stop reading, even though there were plenty of times I was frustrated with Abby.
B009GEYX5E|3.0|Honestly, the color was nowhere near the quality of the old polaroids. Even though it said they did not need to be turned over and protected from light after being shot, I still did and there was little sharpness to any of them. Considering the price, I probably won't buy these again.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|Nice range of Christmas tunes, Rod Stewart makes many of them sound totally different from the original versions, easy listening
B003O86FMW|4.0|Not sure if I love it or hate it. Missed emotions almost made me feel like I had read the first one again but with a different twist.
B00A6X9Z8E|5.0|lots of good songs, she has a great voice and a great library of hits, good listening music to work by
B003B02O14|5.0|I love to read any of John Grisham books, he is an extraordinary author, this book is excellent to read.
0307594009|2.0|One thing I love about true story books-especially Anne Frank- is the pictures throughout the book. I know, sounds juvenile, but usually there's a couple. I was kind of bummed, havent started reading it yet, but will soon. It's a good book though
0307595579|5.0|Bought these as a gift for someone and now I am jealous that I do not have this set. Very well made.
B000NIVJGI|4.0|I wish it had more stuff inside like pictures of the making of it, but it's a classic movie, who doesnt love hot sweaty mullets?!
B0024FAR5W|5.0|If you do not watch this show you are just plain dumb. Kurt Sutter kills it with the writing again.
B003Y5H59C|5.0|James Spader. Oh my goodness you need to see James Spader in this! Not really a chic flick, Maggie has a nude scene that men should love, this kind of movie isnt for the close minded or judgemental. Hard to explain it, but it's a must see!
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|It was a great price, and the music is fantastic. I have no complaints, I just can't understand why it was so cheap. All the better though
B0035G5IOE|4.0|I wasnt a fan of this movie, I loved the book but not so much the movie. It wasnt for me though, it was for my son, and he loved it which is what was important.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|It does not let up the whole movie.  Its about 20 minutes to long, but that really doesn't take away from it to bad.  Yes, its a little over the top, but atleast it's fresh!
1419707671|5.0|This completed my 6yo's series. He loves these books, and def a good value buying it as a box set
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I started watching in season one, the writers are doing a great job keeping the story fresh and exciting. One of the best shows being produced.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|Like ridiculously, overwhelmingly, wicked hot! The movie was pretty awesome, my son loves it, but I really like it because of the drop dead gorgeous main charachter. He shouldn't be allowed to wear a shirt. EVER
B000XUBF3I|5.0|Marla Cilley has been immensely helpful for me.  I've read books on organization, living simply, decluttering, time management, etc.....but nothing has been as helpful as her motivational (and do-able) approach.  Many of her principles are helping me look at housework differently - not as a chore but as a self-blessing (who doesn't like to be in a clean house and appreciate a shining sink?)  Highly recommend it to anyone who feels like they struggle with household management or executive functioning.
0812993292|5.0|You will want to hold Harold's hand as he makes his way and give him hugs to sustain him!  Beautifully written!

B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app is pretty good it works just fine on my kindle although sometimes it gets boring but its fun
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|We bought this for our nephew, who is a Lego freak!  He loves it.<br />It gave him something to look forward to each day before Christmas.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Loved it!  Was so addicting!  Now I want the sequel!  Great characters and visuals.  Liked the puzzles.  Didn't want it to end.
B009O2XY12|5.0|This game is fun, fun, fun!  I don't like running out of energy, though... would like to play for an hour, not 20 minutes... this is the only downside to the game...
1451648537|5.0|It had not been deliberately planned that Walter Isaacson's biography of Steve Jobs would release just days after Jobs died. Not really. Jobs had known for many years that he could not keep his cancer at bay forever and he had specifically asked Isaacson to be his biographer. The book was completed, the publication date set, and then Jobs' condition worsened and he died. And so it happened that a biography--a real biography, not a quick-to-the-presses tabloid pseud-biography--arrived on store shelves so quickly after the death of its subject.<br /><br />Over the past several years Isaacson had been given almost unfettered access into Jobs' life and world. He recorded close to 40 interviews and spoke extensively with family, friends and enemies. This led to a biography that goes deep into the world of its subject and unearths the good, the bad, the shocking and the inspiring. It is an utterly fascinating biography--easily one of the most interesting I've read. That may owe, at least in part, to the fact that Jobs impacted my own life through the devices he created--many of which I use every day (and one of which I am using as I type these words). What is undeniable, whether you use Apple products or not, is that Jobs was a fascinating character who had a profound effect on the world in which he lived. Whether his legacy is judged to be good or bad, he certainly left a legacy that has touched the entire world.<br /><br />I do not intend to write a review of this biography as much as I would like to make a couple of observations about it.<br /><br />Let's get one thing out of the way up-front--the thing that has been the subject of thousands of articles and blog posts in the week since the biography was released. Steve Jobs was not a nice person. In fact, he was often downright horrible, bearing lifelong grudges, throwing tantrums and berating the people who worked for him and with him. He seemed to have a binary view of the world where some things were wonderful and other things were horrible; there was little space between. He despised the mediocre or even the merely good. He used his keen intuition about other people to find and then exploit their vulnerabilities in a way that maximized the hurt he could inflict upon them. He was a brutal boss and a brutal man. He was the kind of man who would praise his own parents for adopting him and then pretty much abandon his own daughter.<br /><br />While examples of his temper and tantrums have been widely discussed and dissected, I think a lot of people have missed the root of it all. Jobs was a lifelong student of Eastern religion and Zen Buddhism in particular. Along the way he became convinced that he was an enlightened being, that he existed on a higher plane than most people. From this exalted position he was able to see and to judge; he had the right to. He was able to stand, if not in the place of God, at least in the place of a judge. He felt that it was his right to speak the truth--the truth as he understood it--to others. After all, he was enlightened and they were not. His arrogance knew no bounds.<br /><br />A brutal man with a terrible temper and a genuine god complex, he was also a man who drove people to new heights of innovation and creativity. As much as people hated to receive a tongue-lashing from Jobs, they knew that in the end he motivated them and pushed them to do better. And this is a crucial component of the strange legacy of Steve Jobs. He will forever be known as a great innovator and a man who lived at the crossroads between the humanities and the sciences. In his own field and in his own way, he sought to make the world a better place. But he did so at the expense of so many people whom he left abandoned and brutalized. It's like he cared for humanity but not for humans, for mankind but not for individuals.<br /><br />As I thought about this, I began to wonder what truly motivated Jobs. What was it that drove him. He was not motivated by accumulating wealth. He died a very rich man, but was not ostentatious, at least when compared to other super-rich people. He was not motivated by philanthropy and, in fact, had little use for it (His wife ran a program for disadvantaged teens and, while he said he was proud of her, he didn't ever bother to visit). So what was it that drove him and made him so unrelenting in his drive for perfection, in his drive to create things that would stand the test of time?<br /><br />I think it may be a desire for immortality. Jobs was always convinced that he would die at a relatively young age--a premonition that proved true. This then drove him to create things that would outlast him. Though his body would die, he could leave behind a company. His greatest and proudest creation was not a gadget, but a corporation; he wanted to leave Apple--the essence of the company--as his legacy to future generations. That is what I found as the subtle and perhaps unwitting theme of this biography--Jobs' knowledge that he was mortal and his desire to be immortal.<br /><br />That is the biography. Allow me to comment on the biographer. Everyone who knew Jobs spoke of a reality distortion field that surrounded him. This was the way people described his charisma and his way of making people bend to his will. He would demand the impossible and somehow make people achieve it. He existed in this place where the world and everyone in it had to bend to him. It almost seemed to come as a surprise to him that he could not will away the cancer that began to ravage his body (and it was certainly not for lack of trying; one of his cancer treatments involved things as strange as expressing all of his negative feelings). Walter Isaacson documents countless examples of people coming into Jobs' reality distortion field and then quickly falling under his sway.<br /><br />The question is, could the biographer avoid the pull of that field, or would he too fall into it? For the biographer to remain objective about his subject, he would need to remain outside that field. Did Isaacson succeed? I am not convinced that he did. It seems that over the course of the book, Isaacson's writing changes. By the end he is not just describing products, but offering gushing editorials about them. Meanwhile, the negative side of Jobs is downplayed in favor of his innovation. I suppose we cannot know for sure, but it seemed to me like Isaacson may have been yet another person who fell under the mysterious sway of Steve Jobs. This does not lessen the biography, but I guess it does show that the definitive account of the man's life may need to wait for a future biographer.<br /><br />As I said from the outset, I found this a particularly compelling biography. Jobs was clearly a very complex individual and Isaacson has succeeded in creating a fascinating character study. I learned a lot from reading it and am still trying to absorb and express those lessons. As is often the case when I read a biography, it will undoubtedly take several weeks or months for it all to settle.<br /><br />I learned earlier today that Steve Jobs' last words were, \\"Oh wow. Oh wow. Oh wow.\\" What I wouldn't give to know what it was that he understood or perceived in those last moments. I wonder if he finally understood futility, that in all of his creativity, in all of his enlightenment, that he had missed the truest light of all.th. He died a very rich man, but was not ostentatious, at least when compared to other super-rich people. He was not motivated by philanthropy and, in fact, had little use for it (His wife ran a program for disadvantaged teens and, while he said he was proud of her, he didn't ever bother to visit). So what was it that drove him and made him so unrelenting in his drive for perfection, in his drive to create things that would stand the test of time?<br /><br />I think it may be a desire for immortality. Jobs was always convinced that he would die at a relatively young age--a premonition that proved true. This then drove him to create things that would outlast him. Though his body would die, he could leave behind a company. His greatest and proudest creation was not a gadget, but a corporation; he wanted to leave Apple--the essence of the company--as his legacy to future generations. That is what I found as the subtle and perhaps unwitting theme of this biography--Jobs' knowledge that he was mortal and his desire to be immortal.<br /><br />That is the biography.

B000002N2P|5.0|Music is subjective and everybody is entitled to say what their favorite Green Day album is, and this is mine. No bad songs, great consistency as well. Really, rocking and upbeat. I wore this thing out. To me, it is the last raw and punk album made by these guys.
1416596585|4.0|Perhaps the most notable book of 2011 is Walter Isaacson's biography of Apple's founder Steve Jobs. In a case of interesting timing, Steven Levy has written what is essentially a biography of Google, a company that has sometimes been an ally of Apple and sometimes a nemesis; today it is both. Levy traces the origins of the company through its founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Those two men found a way of doing something no one else had quite been able to master: making billions of dollars through online advertising. The near-endless streams of revenue generated by advertising has since allowed them to pursue innovation in other fields--email, social media, mobile communications and on and on.<br /><br />Like Steve Jobs, Page and Brin are very complex characters whose motives are difficult to understand. Their careers have been marked with great successes and some very public failures. Yet for good or for ill, and at times for both, they have truly changed the world. Not only do they continue to strive to make all of the world's information available to all of us all of the time, but they have also changed the way we access it and understand it. This is a book to read if you want to understand the massive impact Google has made on me and you and all of us. You'll be amazed to learn just how far it extends into your life.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|deals with serious every day subjects but the camera style of filming is typical of the of the person who filmed it. (based off online reviews). I was recommend this on Cnet as a great visual and music oriented film because it uses 50GB of a blu ray disk. Story wise, its very basic following a life of an every day family. Birth of a child, teaching him manors or in general life teachings. It does take some serious twist and turns but overall you come out feeling good about life and what you have. Its basically teaching you that life is happiness. It does have somewhat of a story and the ending is up to you to decided.
1455502758|3.0|I began reading Mortality, Christopher Hitchens' newest book--his final book--on the day it was released. I couldn't sleep that day, so woke up in the wee hours, downloaded it to the iPad and began reading. It's not a long work, so did not take more than a couple of hours. Like everything Hitchens wrote, Mortality is brilliant and insightful and well-written and utterly defiant. One of the best-known and most widely-respected of the New Atheists, he both denied and hated God to the end.<br /><br />Hitchens was only sixty-two when he died. He had just released a memoir, Hitch-22, and was on a book tour to promote it when he suddenly developed terrible pain in his chest and thorax. He began a long and ultimately unsuccessful treatment for esophageal cancer and died eighteen months later in December of 2011. In the time between he penned a series of columns for Vanity Fair and those columns form the basis of Mortality. Not surprisingly, they deal with illness and death and...mortality.<br /><br />I read this book as a Christian, exactly the kind of person Hitchens wrote against--a Bible-believing, God-fearing theist. Yet I read it with far more sadness and pity than offense. At times in his voluminous writings Hitchens was monstrously unfair to Evangelical Christians, lumping us in with the Fred Phelps' and Muslim extremists of the world. At other times he was guardedly respectful. This book spans both extremes. Many professed Christians earned his disrespect. Take the author of this comment that Hitchens came across while traveling the World Wide Web:<br /><br />Who else feels Christopher Hitchens getting terminal throat cancer [sic] was God's revenge for him using his voice to blaspheme him? Atheists like to ignore FACTS. They like to act like everything is a \\"coincidence.\\" Really? It's just a \\"coincidence\\" [that] out of any part of his body, Christopher Hitchens got cancer in the one part of his body he used for blasphemy? Yeah, keep believing that, Atheists. He's going to writhe in agony and pain and wither away to nothing and then die a horrible agonizing death, and THEN comes the real fun, when he's sent to HELLFIRE forever to be tortured and set afire.<br /><br />Of course not all Christians reacted with such glee and such firm confidence of an intimate understanding of God's providence. There were others who were kind, who told him that, like it or not, they would pray for him, and who sought to bring him encouragement.<br /><br />While several of the essays carry on Hitchens' arguments against the existence of God and for the futility of faith, others simply look at the cold, hard facts of battling cancer (though he was more of the opinion that cancer was battling him). These entries trace the physical decline, the pain, and the utter indignity of suffering and death. But they do it with no real hope. Death was fast approaching and Hitchens acknowledged nothing, no good, beyond that moment.<br /><br />Just as many Christians have felt the need to finish strong, to serve as an example of faithfulness to the end, Hitchens knew that many eyes were turned to him to see if at the end he would relent, if before he died he would at the very least accept Pascal's Wager. As far as we know, he did not. He was a resolute atheist to the end.<br /><br />He left behind not only this collection of essays, but also little fragments from a notebook that are collected at the end. Some of them are nearly meaningless, some are reflective (\\"Morning of biopsy, wake and say whatever happens this is the last day of my old life. No pretense of youth or youthfulness anymore. From now on an arduous awareness.\\") while others are tantalizing. \\"If I convert it's because it's better that a believer dies than that an atheist does.\\" I would have enjoyed seeing him tease out that one.<br /><br />Unlike Hitchens' other books, this one ends without a conclusion, without wrapping things up. Though he knew that his condition was fatal, though he knew he hadonly a short time to live, still he hoped to write at least one more chapter, one more essay. But perhaps it is fitting that his death was the final chapter, that the book concluded when his life concluded. To the moment of death he was as in life, honest, eloquent and defiant.only a short time to live, still he hoped to write at least one more chapter, one more essay. But perhaps it is fitting that his death was the final chapter, that the book concluded when his life concluded. To the moment of death he was as in life, honest, eloquent and defiant.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This bible app is excellent. So many versions to compare and read. I've used it for over a year and it only gets better.
0307730697|4.0|Adam Brown was one of the elite of the elite, a member of SEAL Team SIX, the counterterrorism unit that has among its accomplishments the capture of Osama bin Laden. Brown was also a man with a history of addiction and all that attends it--theft and broken relationships and devastation. Most important of all, Brown was a man who had experienced grace and forgiveness through a relationship with Jesus Christ. His story, told by Eric Blehm in the book Fearless, is making waves today, having established itself on the New York Times list of bestsellers.<br /><br />In many ways Fearless is typical for the biography of a warrior. It tracks Brown through his childhood and then, once he had made up his mind to join the Navy, through bootcamps, other forms of training, and eventually, through deployment in South America, Afghanistan and Iraq. Along the way we read of his brutal battle with addiction to crack cocaine, an addiction that followed him and haunted him even years after he had been through recovery. We also read of how he came to faith, eventually following the example of his parents and mentors, giving his life in service to Jesus Christ.<br /><br />Brown's life came to an end on March 17, 2010, the day he was gunned down in the mountains of Afghanistan, losing his life in service to his country while destroying a dangerous terrorist cell. Of course his story continues in this book and in the lives of his wife and children and friends.<br /><br />Eric Blehm has penned a powerful book in Fearless. It is well-written and tells an intriguing story of a fascinating individual. I would suggest that the main reason for the book's appeal is in Brown's quirky character. He was a fearless warrior and one with an impossibly high pain threshhold. He was one of those people who seemed to live his life in overdrive, doing things that appear to be fool-hardy or near-impossible or, in all likelihood, both. He was an eminently likeable guy.<br /><br />A second reason for its success is that it has been written to appeal to both men and women. Sure, there is a fair bit of military action, a component that men tend to enjoy more than women, but so much of what SEAL Team SIX did remains classified that Blehm has had to focus less on missions and more on the colorful cast of characters that always surrounded Brown. This makes it a character-driven book led by Brown but pausing as well to introduce other fascinating people.<br /><br />And then there is the appeal of a story of redemption, a man emerging from the depths to become a real man, one who had learned to cast off the utter selfishness of addiction so he could love and serve others. He was able to do this only after encountering the God who is so much stronger and more powerful than the addiction that had gripped him for so many years.<br /><br />I feel as if I am sticking my neck out a little in expressing the one disappointment I had with this book: the lack of spiritual depth. Yes, Brown and his family are Christians, but the faith the author describes is as much about platitudes (\\"Adam is watching us from heaven and smiling...\\") than the beautiful depths of the Christian faith. Don't hear me say that I doubt Brown's faith; I do not doubt it at all. But I guess I am always on the look-out for the biography of the Christian soldier (or Christian athlete or...) who has a really deep faith, who does more than express that \\"Jesus has a plan for my life\\" and repeat basic Christian truths. There are very few like that and I have often wondered why that is. In this case, it is notable that Eric Blehm is not a Christian (saying in the Afterword that he has not opened a Bible in twenty-five years), so perhaps he just does not understand what Christians are telling him about their faith. Perhaps he has distilled what people have said into convenient catchphrases. I don't know. In reading Fearless you will encounter a genuine conversion story, but you will not encounter a great depth of truth beyond that. It's a little bit disappointing in that regard.<br /><br />Fearless is a story that had to be told, and though it is a difficult story to hear, passing as it does through terrible addiction and ending in death, it is both powerful and inspiring, and I am glad to recommend it to you.<br /><br />Do note that there is some rough language in the book--this is the navy after all. There is nothing outrageous, but it still contains words you would not want your children to repeat.ond that.

B00A31UXLW|4.0|I count the months towards the release of a Michael Connelly novel. The writing is terse, tight. The action draws you in and keeps you guessing and the plot well crafted. Most of all, though, his characters are flawed and believable and funny and human. We've got to know Harry so well.He makes mistakes with his women-we see his vulnerability-and now we see his vulnerability as the father of a teenage daughter. So, despite his toughness- his hard-drinking, hard-living exterior-he worries about his tendency to get things wrong with his daughter. She's also another strong character and she's very wise. This is such an interesting development in the Harry Bosch books.

The fact that the harder Abby tried to run away from Travis... The more she falls for him. I have only finished reading it a day ago and I have already began re-reading it... Its unhealthy, I know, but I can't get it out of my system... Jamie McGuire is now  my favorite author and this is now my favorite book of all time.. This book is about a college student who is trying to get the \\"perfect\\" college experience, because she is running away from her past, only to be sucked into the very thing she was running away from. Tavis is the worst kind of bad boy, with his super sex appeal and his need to be Abbys friend because she won't have him.. He feels the need to protect her and at the  same time won't admit to his behind for her.. Its awesome!!! Can't wait for the nico book!!!

B006C67NP6|5.0|I bought the app, downloaded the jazz tunes from the forum, and used it the next day on a fill-in gig with a band that plays a lot of standards.  The chord charts saved me on at least half a dozen tunes.  The app easily paid for itself that day.<br />I haven't tried any of the other features yet (transposing, adding your own charts etc).<br />My only minor complaint so far is that the search feature doesn't handle spaces.  e.g. to find the changes to &#34;As Time Goes By&#34;.  If you search on just &#34;time&#34; you get too many matches to fit on the screen.  If you search on either &#34;time goes&#34; or &#34;timegoes&#34; you get no matches.  Note - this happens with version 1.6, I assume it will get fixed in a later version.

B009FB3XTA|3.0|Not thrilled with all the songs-they are growing on me though!.I liked the first movies cd best!too much mumbling while singing!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Came fast, and the season is really good! My kids wanted this for Christmas, and now we are watching along with them - we got hooked!  Never thought I would watch anything with zombies, but we enjoy it!
B005EXA8XC|5.0|Really shows the simplicity of their shows. Lets the music speak for it's self. I appreciated that though it was a halloween concert they weren't in costume.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Read this for book club.  loved it! so did the whole book club. Definitely makes you think (after you finish the book!).  easy to read, fast paced, never lets up.  A must for any book fan!
B000WQW988|5.0|One of the best Nirvana performance ever. I had the cd but it was edited. The dvd really shows how the band was.
B007V65R54|4.0|I would compare this book to Freakonomics (and its sequel -- Super Freakonomics) in its stress on the application of analytics to practical and current topics.  This book adds a lot of insight into the limitations of analytics -- why forecasters, pundits, and experts are often spectacularly wrong even when they base their predictions on data.  Freakonomics and its sequel were much more &#34;optimistic&#34; -- counting on data and analytics alone to reach their conclusions.<br /><br />The net result is that Freakonomics an easier read, and its findings are more likely to be accepted as &#34;the truth&#34; by its readers.  &#34;The Signal and the Noise&#34; is more humble and more accurate, but many readers will find it harder to follow, and its apparent &#34;lack of certainty&#34; can make the author appear to be unsure of himself.  Unfortunately, as Silver himself points out, people are used to the brash certainty of the talking heads on TV.  Many readers may therefore be turned off by the author's refusal to pretend to be all-knowing about its subjects.<br /><br />I didn't give the book 5 stars because its organization is a bit weak, and it tends to get too detailed.  The result is that it is hard to spot the key concepts.  There are so many trees, it is hard to see the forest.  In some sense, there is so much noise (details) that the signal becomes unclear.
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|I'm a big scifi fan and I enjoyd the movie very much.<br /><br />I especially liked the set that was made in the style of Blade Runner. That was a nice homage to that set designer and gave the move a very familiar feel, but that set was not the only backdrop .  The stroy is told a little bit like a tale of two cities.  A beatutful shining city of the corrupt establishment and the colony of rebels. The colony set was done in the Blade Runner style.<br /><br />The elevated highway with the maglev car chase scene was really well done.<br /><br />I'm not a big Colin Farrell fan, but he played his part well. Kate Beckinsale also turned in a very strong performance as the top cop out to get Farrell.  Her performance was intense and very believable and made the movie better.<br /><br />Now I want to see the Schwarzenegger version again.
B002M9WW30|5.0|Pretty simple - if you want to buy all the Rocky movies and have a box to hold them in then buy this. If you are a Rocky fan you already know what you are going to get.
B005KB0SU6|4.0|Como la Sombra del viento, me encanta este libro.  No podía parar de leerlo.  Mueve may rápido con cambios de dirección muy a menudo.  David, el protagonista, es ambos héroe y anti-héroe. No Lo di cinco Estrellas a causa del fin de la novela.  Por la novela Los personajes, aunque sean míticos o sobrenaturales, se quedan &#34;en character&#34;.  Un personaje principal hace algo al fin que no cabe con el personaje que creyó el autor..de todas mantras, Lo recomiendo..
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I got this and planned on letting my kids entertain themselves with it but I use it more than they do, guess its cute but not &#34;cool&#34;, oh well all the retro games are better than the new ones anyway.
B0076DEJMO|4.0|Good story with a good ending. Liked the way the characters have progressed. Would have liked a little more mayhem from the bloody nine.
B00AGOGOLE|1.0|does not give enough information to operate or save pics.  and the idea that you can only take pics with it facing yourself is really ridiculous.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is a totally interesting peek into the world of the Navy Seal AND the world of snipers.  The descriptions of some of the big battles in Iraq were very informative and gave a very comprehensive explanation of what was going on there at the time.  The author is very open and candid, a very well written autobiography.
B00ADS98FC|4.0|We liked this movie. We found it to be funny and entertaining.<br />However, as in most stuff out these days, there are some attempts at sexual humor that are not necessary and are not funny.<br />The movie rolls along nicely then it falls flat at moments with poorly contrived, what they hoped would be edgy, humor, that just isn't.<br />This movie could have been a classic if they would have dropped those parts.
B0055PGUYU|3.0|Duhigg provides many examples of how we are manipulated by companies to change our habits, and more so how we have the power within ourselves to manipulate our own decisions that will affect the way we live our lives....good read
B000VYX8PE|3.0|I've seen the movie before I read this book I liked the movie a lot, it was great, but the book was just ok I think I would have liked it better if I haven't seen the movie first and read the series first because without Jim Carey prancing around and the faster pace of the movie the book felt like it was lacking something.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I loved the books! I bought them for my fifth grade daughter and enjoyed them more than she has! Love The Hunger Games
B000AGTPUK|5.0|Hopefully I'm not the only 50-something adult who LOVES this story and its concept. Since this first aired I look forward to watching it each holiday season. Now that I own it, I can watch it whenever I want!
B007TNS6JI|4.0|Easy to learn and fun to play. Gets a bit repetitive but hey killing monsters is still fun. Worth a look.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The plot continues to thicken!!I could visualize  the entire sequence of events. Excellent writing and draws you in for more. Finished the book in one day. I recommend the entire series.
B003UESJF6|5.0|I watched this movie over and over without ever getting bored. It has a good story to it, we are who we chose to be, change your mind and you can change your life, true story!!!
0345803485|2.0|There was absolutely nothing outstanding about this book and honestly this story could have been told in a few chapters rather than as an entire novel.  And if the other two books are the same way the entire 'trilogy' could possibly have been written as one novel, but since I have not read them yet and may or may not at this point I can't really say too much about that.  I'm really not sure what all the hype about this book is.  I have read many short erotic tales with BDSM themes that I thought were more well done than this full length novel.  Perhaps my problem is that I am such a defiant person that as soon as I read the contract bit my 'oh no you didn't' attitude came out.  Honestly if I was the main character I would have laughed in his face and thrown the contract on the ground and possibly spit on it.  I don't care how good looking you are, or how much money you have, that is not in my scope of acceptable behavior, but obviously this is a work of fiction and I do get that, so I tried to put that behind me, but it was tough.  The sex scenes were pretty hot, I will give the author that, but at some point I'm done with those and want a real story, not just a bunch of sex.  It got tedious to read after a while.  The ending was a bit tough to read so I will congratulate the author on that.  I was wanting to know what would happen after what I'm going to call the incident, however after thinking about the entire novel again, I'm just not sure I want to waste my time.  We'll see though.  And to whomever made a comment on facebook about reading Ana's 'oh my's' in George Takei's voice, thank you.  At least I got a good laugh out of that.
0767836324|5.0|I watched this movie as a child and I brought it for my 9 year old daughter, she loves it just as I suspected.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|this game is really good i only have 2 problems with it it takes forever to load and u waste gems  whole lot but get it great game
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I got this movie for my daughter and she absolutely loves it, she watches it over and over and over!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I find this little app fairly handy for<br />my fire kindle. tells me how much juice I had left by % & by not bars.  It also breaks it down for you depending what you use hour device for
B001TODCII|5.0|I wanted to watch this b/c I heard it was good and it was. I was on the edge of my seat b/c thats crazy that people really go around kidnapping &#34;out-of-towners&#34; just for the heck of it, oh yeah prostitution.
B008KYOCA2|4.0|I just purchased this item a few days ago but I think I will use it a great deal.  I have an I product and do not like their calendar.  I now will have to carry my Kindle with me but that is ok.  I will write another review after I use it for a few weeks.
B005G4TJUC|4.0|I like this movie, but i was bummed that megan fox wasn't in it! I dont care about her having attitude problems, she made part 1 and 2 belivable. I dont care too much for the victoria secret model.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Great series.<br /><br />Wonderful series wish it could have gone on for more episodes. Kept me interested completely! I loved it!
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|Mahjong Deluxe. It's more complicated than my old game and not so much fun.  I'll use my old one thanks.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|Morgan Rice's straight forward writing style makes his foray into the heroic fantasy genre an easy read, but the story is something of a train wreck.  Thor's ascension from anonymous farm boy to a member of the royal family's inner circle within a matter of days is pretty hard to swallow. Most of the characters are flat caricatures, and the details of Rice's fantasy world don't seem to be well thought out, and often don't make sense. This novel certainly could have used the services of a professional editor as well. The book is filled with typos, incorrect words, bad grammar, anachronistic language, and inconsistent spelling of character names. I don't understand how any of the favorable reviews for this book can compare it to Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. A Quest For Heroes is in no way on par with top shelf heroic fantasy novels.
B0053YGYO4|4.0|my grandson really likes this cd! he says it is one of his favorites! he plays it all the time
B0000549B0|5.0|I loved harvey, because it shows how simply life could be !  I would recommend this movie to any one that needs a good laugh !
B009MCRHH6|4.0|I had this for PC and was excited to be able to have this on my phone.  Not bad, though with the smaller screen, the interface is less precise than on a desktop PC.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is fun exciting and very addictive . Running jumping and sliding over and under obstacles is more fun than it sounds. I would definitly encourage people to get this game.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|The original Advent Children was awsome enough, this complete versiou clarifies things even better than the original with improved fighting scenes and other awsome sequences.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I can't believe lifeproof actually charges this much for their cases. I was very disappointed. Very cheep and flimsy. The film on the cover has bubbles under that you can not press out! In return throwing off the accuracy for the touch. I was pissed to find that when I tried to use my camera with the flash on, that I got a very blurred image. Mainly because the flash reflects off the case. So whatever color your case is the color you will see across the picture. Don't use the flash and the camera works fine in the day time with plenty of light. So you basically have to take the case off to use at night and get the flash to work. Which its a pain to get the case on and off. Bottomline...DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!
B001HZK8FY|1.0|I loved the movie, but the box was broken when I got it and the dvd fell right out of it. Other than that I was happy with the movie
B004QX07G4|4.0|As a long time fan of Ellen, I looked forward to reading anything that she wrote. I recognize some things that she has written about in some of her stand up routines, however that just tells me that she takes things from her real life and makes us laugh about them too. She is truly a treasure.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I have been having a really hard time lately and throwing myself into books. This book really pulled me out of a funk. It was very engaging and had a lot of life advice, no matter your age.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|I say that because it was, but it had to be incomprehensible to endure for Jaycee. She endured things that would be unbearable to go through for an adult, but to of gone through it at 11 and 12 is unimaginable. This book was written with some maturity, but at times it did ramble on. But I don't know if I can fault it for doing so. I try to keep in mind that this &#34; woman&#34; grew up in a shack in a backyard. She wasn't educated, she wasn't loved, she wasn't free. So while the &#34; Loved, educated and free&#34; part of me struggled with the writing style, I also felt over come with grief for her. This is truly a remarkable woman.
B00846REIS|1.0|Very similar to fifty shades of gray, not original at all! Worth reading if you have never  read Fifty Shades of Gray but if you have saved  your money on this one.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I love the case, and the art book it comes with. All the Dark Knight films for $28, on Blu-Ray, was a fantastic deal. It's impossible not to feel satisfied with my purchase.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|This movie was way better then I expected! Loved the setting and the actors did an amazing job! Worth watching again!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I found this book to be a fantastic read!  There were times I would be laughing and other times I would be in tears.  The relationship of Ana and Christian was both erotic and heartfelt.  I will surely be keeping these books! :)
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great free app. Does everything advertised. I use this app every day. I definitely recommend this app for any kindle users.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Fantasy. Mind games. Manipulation. And a confusing as hell manipulation<br />  I need 10 more words to submit this reveiw yea
B0058YPGVQ|5.0|It came quick and in great condition, couldn't have asked for more. We loved it and are looking forward to getting season five when it comes out.
B008XOXGL0|5.0|This is one of the best vinyl's ever I like this album from the start to the end its one of the first albums I've been able to listen to from start to finish, and overall worth it!!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The beginning was a bit dry, but once the ship wrecked the book was an exciting, unbelievable account of survival. I now want to see the movie.
B008476HBM|5.0|The language in this novel is beautiful. The story is compelling. I wish all books of this nature were required reading.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I literally consumed this book in a matter of days. Such a great story if survival, hope and spirituality. The ending is surprising and thought provoking. Definitely on my list of favorites.
B005DJGMQE|5.0|Much has already been said about this movie. I just wanted to add the star rating and make the comment that it is encouraging to see a movie where justice matters to someone at least. This is very much an INFJ movie. I probably took too much social psych in college, but I have long believed that groups and especially crowds are just not trustworthy.<br />This movie perfectly confirms the fact that emotions combined with peer groups are dangerous. It takes a great deal of courage to withstand peer pressure for the cause of justice - let's hope this movie encourages more such courage.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I was unaware of the book series until the first movie came out, and have since read the second and final books. The books give so much great detail that coincide with the movie so well. It's great being able to read and have a wonderful image of the characters that were so greatly chosen for the movies it help bring out the passion as I read. I really feel Suzanne have us a complete story w a beautiful ending.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Very good. Kind of a deep story which taught a lot of good lessons to me while reading this book
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It's a good app. It does show all of the news feed, I like it.. I would recommend it. Honestly I don't know why people hate it. Guess they're lyinggg. Lmao :)
B009VB97EY|1.0|This was a terrible movie. The acting was awful. Could not figure out what plot they were going with just bad
B009XJHRQ4|4.0|As a German, it is very difficult to find Mein Kampf. The schools don't allow even small excerpts of it and no publisher dares to bring it on the market. The Bavarian state holds the copyright and -just like the Vatican in old times- has the opinion that an undesirable book must bet forbidden.<br /><br />For those who intend to load it onto their Kindle be warned: Hitler's book is not at all sensational and takes quite a time to find parts which are really interesting. But everybody with interests in History should read it.<br />I suggest: Mein Kampf should be shortened to about one third of its contents. Hitler repeats himself all the time, making the reader very bored.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|What if...an intriguing and dangerous idea.  King weaves the history of JFK' s assassination into a time travel novel that was difficult to put down...glad I had the week off.  Lovers of King, time travel, romance, and suspense should all enjoy this book.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Wow! This was one incredible testament to the life of Adam Brown and those that believed in him.  Probably one of my favorites and one that every American should read.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitaire is lots of fun and user friendly. It takes only a couple of minutes to understand how it works.
B009A87Z6U|3.0|I love the James Bond movies, so even an average 007 flick is a good time, but I'd have to admit this is one of the weakest 007 films. The villain and Bond girl are not memorable at all. If you like 007, then surely you've probably seen it. If you're trying to get someone into 007, I wouldn't start with this film.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was excited to read this latest release by Colleen Hoover because I LOVED Slammed and Point Of Retreat. Although this book is very different from the Slammed series the story line and writing is just as great. Colleen Hoover has a gift for writing great characters with a great story that just sucks you in to the very end.<br />The subject matter in this book is a bit dark and of a serious nature and I believe Hoover did it justice. I would definitely recommend this book.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|Thank you!  My husband was so delighted when I gave him this for his birthday!  It was an awesome surprise!  I can't wait to watch it with him!
1451695195|5.0|Reason for Reading:  My friends had been talking about the book about the little boy who went to Heaven and everyone was mentioning that there was a new one out about a doctor who had had the same experience.  That was the one I was interested in reading, so I was thrilled when I received a copy to review out of the blue!<br /><br />I'll refer to the author as Eben as that is what he is most referred to by others in the book.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book; it is the first modern-day account of Heaven that I have read.  I found it fascinating.  Of course, his descriptions of what Heaven is like makes profound reading for a believer, but it is also the complete tale of his story that is awe-inducing.<br /><br />Eben writes the details of his medical condition that caused him to be virtually brain-dead and in a coma for seven days in a voice that makes all the medical intricacies understandable to the lay person.  This is very important for the reader to realize just how unrealistic his recovery was in this situation.  The fact that Eben is a neurosurgeon also means that the book is filled with exceptional details, again written as to be understandable to the lay person, on how the brain works and just what scientists and the mainstream medical community believe about the brain and the scientific incompatibility of believing in a soul when one puts their faith in scientific knowledge.  It is amazing how non-believer scientist Eben, flooded with the realities of God is able to come to terms with faith and science and explain how they go hand in hand.  A must read as the publishers promote for both scientists and believers.  The only problem I had with the book was one particular chapter where the author strays from presenting the facts and theorizes about religion and I found his theology way off but he is entitled to his musings and conclusions, no points off my review for that!  Very interesting and uplifting, especially in the fact that it presents how science and religion *do* work side by side when your faith is in the Creator.religion *do* work side by side when your faith is in the Creator.
B00932AA5G|4.0|Although it masquerades as a thriller, Headhunters' tongue is placed firmly in cheek, with bloody and gross adventures of an ambitious headhunter who gets in way over his head.  A nifty adaptation of the eponymous novel by Jo Nesbø.
1607066017|5.0|Reason for Reading:  I'm finding myself more pulled towards sci-fi than fantasy in my graphic novel reading and this sounded both fresh and involved.<br /><br />Love, love, love this book.  An incredible story.  One that is intricate, involves many levels, plots, characters and yet it all centres around the two main characters, an interspecies couple who has wed and born a child together.  Their species have been at war with each other for what may as well have been forever and yet these two are unique examples of \\"people\\" not defined by species alone.  Taking the race card one step further into species we see the same old bigotry being played out on a grander scheme as one species believes it is of an higher order than an other.  What I particularly love at this point is how incredibly life affirming the context is.  Having children is not exactly something encourage in this society, especially girls, but this couple affirms their love by having a child and later on in the book another (different species) couple find out they are pregnant and the issue is brought up whether the husband is happy, and won't mind even if it is a girl.  He responds positively.  The sex trade involving children is examined and the most unlikely of characters becomes a little girl's rescuer and advocate.  I love the two main characters, they are both upright people and yet their personalities and morals are different, sometimes clashing.<br /><br />For warning, the book does include coarse language, not every page but frequent enough.  I found it acceptable for the characters using it.  There is full frontal nudity of both sexes, even though they aren't all \\"human\\", yet I was pleased that these scenes were at least between married couples.<br /><br />The art is stupendous.  This is my first introduction to Fiona Staples but I will be watching for her name in future.  Her drawings are realistic and she brings humanity to her non-human subjects as well as presenting simply stunning panels.  Her character's facial expressions are able to say so much more than words ever could.  A brilliant new series, that I am anxious to follow up with.Her character's facial expressions are able to say so much more than words ever could.

B0094K1K42|4.0|Docu-eze drama about a youngish woman who writes young adult novels and cannot outgrow her past.  As usual, Theron is absolutely fabulous.  Squirmy but good comedy.
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|I love the different ways the birds can kill the pigs, they incorporated the Star Wars theme really well.  Another winner from Rovio.
B007KOYEOC|3.0|Not nearly as good as the first too. Didn't like the ending, was too cushy but glad I finished the series.

B007XKEY6Q|1.0|This app is Boring. I got rid of this app, cause, it is very boring. I would recomend like Words with Friends. Or something like that. Why is there a Paid version and a Free version. OMGPOP wont make any money if they have the same game free or paid. That is so weird.
B0092MKFIY|4.0|Not the best CD of 2012, but it is enjoyable. Some songs are repetitive to me, but other songs are fairly good.

B00AIQP9DE|5.0|The game is great easy enough to find the objects. Graffics are fantastic clear and colorful, you can also zoom in and out or get hints... I really enjoyed playing this game.
B008B68IV8|5.0|I actually picked this up on Ebay a few weeks back but I wanted to review the product here since the price is decent now.<br /><br />For a budget Monster High doll, Ghoulia's Scaris release really shines in terms of style. Her hoodie dress (featuring a cool ribcage and pocket with a brain matter pattern) is to die for and her sneaker-like heels (in a simple shade of sky blue with white skulls on the side) are so cute! I also like her in ponytail so I'm glad they did that with her hair again this time around.<br /><br />Despite my overall pleasure with the doll I do have a few concerns to point out.<br /><br />The art on the box makes the bag look somewhat rounder and much more like a typical bag white the one she's packaged with is more like a box with a lid. I suppose it's not strange but it looks a bit \\"off\\" to me. Personal preference I guess. I also notice with this Ghoulia release and the release of her deluxe fashion pack it seems that Mattel aims to remove green from her wardrobe which worries me a bit. It's not that blue looks bad on her but she's reminding me of Frankie a bit...<br /><br />Also, if you decide to take her bangs out of the rubber bands that keep them behind her glasses, be warned! They tend to frizz out and look a bit sloppy. Also her glasses may or may not leave a small dent on the bridge of her nose when you move them from her face.<br /><br />Overall, love the doll though! How can you not love it? It's Ghoulia after all. &lt;3
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|thought it was worth money great game keeps you interested. would like a sequel had no problems on my kindle
B007RTAR64|5.0|My daughter really loves this item.  She dressed up as her character for Halloween this year.  We were completely satisfied with this purchase, especially the price which was well below the current market value offered in the stores.  We would highly recommend adding this item to your collection!

B00846TTDG|1.0|People please.  This is a tribute movie paying tribute to the very special men who protect our freedom.  It is not a good movie, there is no plot.  I think it was mainly made to highlight the names of men who have died for us.  But the movie and the acting are not very good.  It is a bit like a video game.
B00AIQP9DE|2.0|It's more ESCAPE GAME than HIDDEN OBJECTS GAME.  Too much back n forth and Narrative. I've played better from G5.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I couldn't put it down-a page Turner for sure. Nicolas Sparks did it again, I always love his stories about life and love.

B00136JQMI|5.0|Should be in any Jazz  Library. Absoulutly timeless. Great sessions, great artists. Even my cats and dog liked this, dog gave it 5 stars, cats wanted more catnip before tendering review.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|I heard great reviews about this book , however after reading it I felt empty and wished  for more substance.  This particular book was highly overrated !  I discommend to any reader looking for a deeper reading experience.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|These past couple months I've been getting more and more into the romance genre, and this book was a different take on it. Original, with some of the elements we crave and love.<br /><br />Connor is a steaming package of sexy, with a company, money, good looks, and everything a girl could ever want. Megan is a reserved, responsible young woman with a vision for her future, determined to never fall in love again and hurt herself. Just from these descriptions, you can tell that this is a love story for the archives! Kelly's writing style brought their romance to life, and I really enjoyed the realism of their relationship.<br /><br />Not too much happened in this book, since it was mostly Connor and Megan trying to work out their relationship, but I still enjoyed it. Kelly kept me interested to the end with the characters' backstories and issues that arose. And the ending was just adorable. I almost died from how perfect it was.<br /><br />Highly recommended to anyone looking for a great love story and an enjoyable read! :)
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|Maybe because my wife and I really enjoy Family Guy, we expected more laughs. I think having Seth use Peter Griffin's voice made us think of Family Guy too much. There were some unexpected laugh out loud moments, but I wish there had been more jokes that weren't just crude sex jokes.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|Not a page turner as others of the trilogy, but a sound conclusion. The third and final book conects the dots of Salander's emotional struggle with her past and present. The story drags a bit building background of the infamous &#34; Zala &#34; and many new charactors arise from the past, but that being said soon begins to keep the reader rivited. A recomended read and not a stand alone story like Mr. Larsson's previous two offerings.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|I liked this film, I liked the story line, Clint Eastwood, OK. He plays an over the hill father and baseball scout. Amy Adams plays his daughter, a smart, savvy lawyer, whose entire life is her job, somewhat like her father. John Goodman plays Gus's (Eastwood) boss,  and Justin Timberlake plays an injured baseball player turned scout.<br /><br />Gus is losing his sight, which is his mainstay in his business. Mickey, his estranged daughter is called about Gus's problems by Goodman's character. She is betwixt and between, she is on the edge of a big business promotion, but she decides to pay her father a visit. They quarrel, but she perseveres and helps dad with his scouting. They concentrate on Bo Gentry, an obnoxious country boy who thinks he is hot stuff. Gus does not like Gentry, he can hear the whistle of the ball when it slides by Gentry and knows he can't hit all the balls. Timberlake's character is not so certain. Timberlake and Mickey meet and carry on in a grown- up manner and their repertoire is entertainng. The final day when Gus must give his appraisal of Bo Gentry is the complete opposite of the computer generated models. Will Gus's decision be his last? Will Mickey and the scout hook up? Wil Bo Gentry meet his comeuppance?<br />Stay tuned, the last scenes are worth the price.<br /><br />Recommended. prisrob 01-02-13<br /><br />[[ASIN:B003EUCNA8 Leap Year]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B005HGKYB2 The Big Uneasy]]
0894803123|5.0|We bought this book with our new Cuisanart ice cream maker and love it. Ben & Jerry provide some great ice cream recipes in here but what I love most is that they provide tips and &#34;secrets&#34; of ice cream making. They also provide recipes for 3 different bases so you can play around with it a little to see which ones you like. I haven't found a recipe I haven't liked yet and they are super easy.<br /><br />Kudos to Ben & Jerry for having the kahunas to provide their recipes to the public!
B008F5YDRI|4.0|It is not as sappy as most making it far more enjoyable.  Also pokes fun at politics while remaining apolitical.
1419705849|5.0|A winner. THanks My son has all of the books and really enjoyed this book. Thanks for the amazing price.
B00AHSINKO|1.0|How could this be so dark, tragic and repugnant?  all great actors, potentially fun and funny plot but misses the humor of reality in a big way.  Turn it off....
B001EC3JME|1.0|When I first saw this holster I was impressed first by the fact that it could hold various sized flashlights and second by the clip design which is sturdy and lets the holster rotate. After using this holster for a couple months with my LED LENSER tactical flashlight the elastic became permanently stretched. My flashlite is 2\\"dia.x7\\"long; same diameter down the entie lenght. Because this holster stretched out, my flashlight continually fell out of it putting dings and scratches on it. This is a very bad holster for these types of flashlights. Very disappointed especially it being an American product. Would not recommend this to anyone.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|We really enjoyed the movie and my kids have watched it 3 times. It is very much like Glee which my family enjoys watching as well.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|Draw something free (Kindle tablet edition)  Just started and don't completely understand yet,<br />but lots of fun! Can't wait to learn more about colors and points.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Kept me going till the end....good reading and great end. The who done it was very well disguised until the very end.
B004FK24ZA|5.0|Love this movie but I was disappointed that the case was written in Japanese and there were Japanese subscripts for the first minute or two of the movie. Very weird!
B004V5QWU2|2.0|It's nice but the audio clips, at least the ones I tried, have obvious repeats. Usually there is a short gap in the sound and it is distracting especially when it is a short loop. It would also be nice if you could layer more than three sounds. It is nice that you can save mixes. In the end Relax Melodies is much better.<br /><br />I have noticed that none of the other reviews have mentioned the skips so I suppose it could be a new problem or something that only happens on the kindle fire hd.
B008476HBM|5.0|The construction of the story and the storytelling are wonderful. It is a page-turner even though I know how it ends. I wish to find its equivalent in contemporary literature.
B00899F0G8|5.0|This is a series that grabs you and doesn't let go. It's a real roller coaster ride of thrills and delicious plot twists.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|Disappointed with the story. This look more than a drama movie for me than comedy. Lack of trama, This movie was a waste of time for me.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|I throughly enjoyed the crooked paths of the many characters  Mr. Martin devolped. Each chapter left me wanting to read just a little more.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This was one of the best books I have ever read! I think it was good how everybody got to narrate!
1433524708|5.0|My wife got me the regular size study Bible but it was just heavy enought to be heavy. This is a great size and weight. The ESV is pretty easy to read and the footnotes help explain the harder parts. I am glad I found this! I actually found this style on another website and searched for it on Amazon. It didn't come up in my ESV Study Bible Personal Size search. Glad I didn't miss it.
1455502758|4.0|Most know of Christopher Hitchens' recent death from esophageal cancer (Stage IV, there is no Stage V). Most know of his towering intellect through his writing, lecturing and debating skills. Most know him as one of the most prominent literary figures of our time. Most also know him as a concerned atheist.<br />This book details his final stages of cancer in first person. He writes in detail of his treatment, his caregivers, those who wish him well and those who don't, because of his rejection of religion, god and anything of the sort. Indeed, prayer itself he regards as rather presumptuous, implying that the praying individual seeks to rearrange what he or she perceives to be an imperfect situation, a mistake by the \\"Creator.\\"<br />This is not a happy book. For those seeking a more uplifting account of the cancer journey, The Last Lecture by Randy Pausch might be a better read. Hitchens himself takes the book to task saying it's \\"so sugary that you may need an insulin shot to withstand it.\\"<br />This is an honest and important work, from an honest and important man.<br />flag
0739378341|4.0|John Grisham is a good story teller. Although this is not his best. Suspenseful and filled with intrigue; good characters
B004LROMSO|5.0|It is really disappointing that they will  not be making a season 2! I love this show, and the DVD came to me in perfect condition!
0307592731|5.0|Very well written tale of a real life experience. Recommended to my book club and it was one of the favorite books for 2012
B000062XM6|5.0|Product is exactly what it was supposed to be and I received it quickly<br />Thankyou I would recommend this to anyone
0812984412|2.0|Bought this book during the movie release hype and expected a great story based on the actors in the film. maybe the movie will be better
0688172377|5.0|Great insight on Waris Dirie's amazing life. From nomad to model. I could not put it down. I cried of sorrow I cried of joy for her. A must read
B0064MT1LM|5.0|Realluy captures the pain, suffering and sacrifice made by all during this period in history. Will view over and over
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Simply magical and amazing. Read the book in two days. I was hooked from the prologue. Indescribable and highly recommended
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is great! I love it, love it, love it!!!! Just like computer and x-box version. Highly recommend!!! A+ A+ A+ A+
B005LAII8A|4.0|I was very happy to watch the movie for the 1st time and I loved it and it was one of those movies that you think about. You want to know what I mean buy it or rent it and you will see what I mean by that.
B008F5YDRI|5.0|Great character & cast.  Simple story well told.  Just a fun film that moves along and provides entertainment throughout.  This is an easy view & glad we found it.
B005LAIIPS|4.0|I was at a O about it and thought it was so cool and better then the other movies Matt Damion did. Its full of.. well you have to watch it and see..
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Helped me relax very well. Great app, love all the choices you can mix up to make it ideal for yourself
B002IFT1ZA|1.0|We sat down to watch together and hated it so much we shut it off and went to bed. So many good series out there, there's nothing here of any redeeming value at all.
B0098XY5VK|5.0|If u want a fun game to play then download this! It is fun addicting and and easy way for time to pass more quickly!
B00APUQJLO|2.0|Very depressing, too slow.I believe director trying for some thing different sort of avant guard. It was sooo depressing for me,<br />perhaps that is what director/producer were after ?
B0076NAW48|5.0|Great album for blues lovers and anyone who just enjoys a good listening experience.  The piano is one of my favorite instruments and this CD does the instrument justice.
B0053O89WY|5.0|The only downside to this dvd set is the cliffhanger at the end. The 2nd half of the episode is the 1st episode of the 6th (they started back in September 2012). I do not have cable/dish/Netflix to watch the episodes as they roll out so I do not know until the discs come out in May the following year. I would recommend grabbing this one and Sixth together since it stops and you want to know what is going to happen.<br /><br />The seller was fast to sending it since i already had the 4th one and watched them both back to back. All I can say is the ending is great for this season but if you don't have a way to watch the next, you will be upset.
B006R1T40I|5.0|Wonderful album with great new songs!  I purchased this prior to attending a Bonnie Raitt concert so as to be familiar with her new songs.  No disappointment here- great stuff!
B003L77G6A|5.0|I have loved this show since it first started in 2008. This season introduces more female cast to the program. They do it in a way so its not overbearing as well as you don't just hear Penny and Leonard's relationship up's and down's.<br /><br />This dvd set came in before the estimated delivery and I was so happy I wanted to watch it all in one sitting but had to wait for my wife to get off work so we could get back into the Big Bang Theory swing of things.
1932735410|5.0|5 stars because it helped me pass the PMP exam on the first try!  I bought this book 1 month prior to my exam date based on the great reviews here on Amazon.com.  I had no other study materials and did not even read the PMBOK Guide.  I do have the minimum 3 years of hands on experience as a Project Manager, which is a prerequisite for the PMP anyway, but other than that I pretty much just leaned on this book to teach me how to take the exam.  What I did was read through the book once in detail and skimmed over the book a second time focusing on my weak areas, memorized the select formulas, and then took the practice exam questions at the end of each chapter the night before the test.  I highly recommend this book to anyone planning to take the PMP Exam!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins was really good. I couldn't put it down! I love the parts were Katniss is a rebel. I wish I could be in the book!
B009YG2ND8|5.0|I thought the title animation was really cool and all final fantasy games rock so I expect this to. I'm downloading it right now and I'm very glad I'm doing it. jkjkjkjkjkjkjk I was just bored and I'm giving free 5 star reviews
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|How can traditional be refreshing? In this instance it is because Susan Boyle performs these greatest songs as they were meant to be performed...as the storytelling of peoples' lives. Nothing overdone or clever or pop-ish, just brilliant, sweet sounds from a pure and authentic voice. For anyone, whether you love the theater or not, this cd is gorgeous and will take you on a wonderful  and intimate journey.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|really enjoyed this game.  it was fast pace and the best hidden object game I ever played on my kindle fire.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I usually have trouble getting into a new book. This book pulled me right into the story right from the get-go. It was masterful the way the author developed multiple characters and plots. Highy recommend this for a light, entertaining read.
B000JO9JHW|5.0|I had many friends tell me that I would like this show so I started watching it and it is so addicting! I love it! I love murder mystery's and crime shows so I have really enjoyed season 1 and cant wait to watch the rest!
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I love this case it didn't add a lot of bulk and my kindle fits nice and snug into it. The color is beautiful (I got red) and the stand is a nice touch that works great! Im very happy w/ this case!
B009KHBDUU|5.0|Loved this movie, funny and everything you would expected from a Tim burton movie.  A good story line with a good twist.
B005S9EJ14|4.0|This is a heart-warming, unusual and highly entertaining story brought to life by a glittering cast.<br />It also provides an authentic taste of India.<br />Maggie Smith fans will particularly like her role in this production, so dramatically different from her Downton Abbey Dowager Duchess.<br />It's also nice to see Bill Nighy getting his teeth into a role with some depth.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I loved this book. All of the romance, and how detailed the book was I just couldn't stop reading. It only took me three days to read it. I would read it again and again till I could recite every word without even looking at the book...
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My family and I all play this together and we enjoy it very much! We have now moved on to Angry Birds Space and Star Wars but it still is fun to go back and visit when your in a boring waiting room or similar situation
B00AA0TJO8|3.0|You know, I like the idea behind this whole thing but I wish it was more of a 'find this ability' type of questline.  All in all, well made game with a good principle.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Every bit as great as the website. Only thing I don't like is that it appears to be missing just a couple of the websites capabilities. For example, I cannot edit my friends list through this app (or have I just not figured that out?)
B0091REZMW|3.0|A fun game until you run out of resources and are forced to spend real money to continue game play.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|Having OCD I tend to have a little issue with control and over preparation (haha) so I use trip advisor frequently when going anywhere. Whether I am traveling or simply wanting to try a new restaurant or attraction around town. Now having it at the palm of my hands makes it even more convenient! Wonderful app!
B00846TTDG|5.0|Whether or not the story is factual, it is a great one. It is definitely a violent, graphic movie so is not suitable for everyone.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Ok, so I swore I would never get on another &#34;social networking&#34; site. Still, this one is truly different! I have learned so very much! I have found recipes, scrapbooking ideas, holiday decor ides, DIY projects, kids crafts and so much more! I definately reccommend this to anyone interested in this sort of activity. There's truly something for everyone!
0143038095|4.0|The Joy Luck Club is a book that is organized in a series of vignettes. Throughout the novel 8 women (mothers and daughters) are playing mahjong for money as they feast on a great meal. As they play, each character shares stories from their past. Before the story can end another woman begins or continues with her story. The book is constantly changing storylines, but Tan makes the transitions so smoothly that they do not interupt the main line of thought. Each story contains history of China, culture, heartache, loss, frustration, bad matches in marriage, and the will and determination to thrive and strive for happiness despite the barriers that come their way.
B003O86FMW|5.0|If you have read the first book in the series this is an excellent follow up! The author did a great job of keeping the excitement and intrigue going
B006YG9HJE|5.0|Nikita: The Complete Second Season continues from season one. I didn't get the opportunity to watch any of the shows during the regular season, so I was very delighted when I had the opportunity to purchase the entire second season. I'm waiting for season three when that is available.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I love the Hunger Games books. This one however severely dissapointed me. It was so good and then it was almost like the author just gave up and started using &#34;filling&#34; to make it longer and then just put down the easiest ending that came to mind. I expected more..
B00A0SJWQU|2.0|Other than the special effects available today, there was nothing new brought to this story. Also, some of the most crucial parts were taken out. If you just want to get your blazing guns and explosion fix this is okay. However, if you were a fan of the original, save yourself the disappointment.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|This is ebay in the palm of your hands! Just as many features as the website and in my opinion it is even a little more user friendly. Great app
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Interesting plot and enjoyed the characters.<br />Looking forward to the next book!<br />Enjoyed reading and envisioning the world Suzanne Collins created!
B007N5YIUS|5.0|My husband, my children and myself all play this together. It carrys on the tradition of the original angry birds while adding new challenges and new birds.
B0027MJU00|4.0|This was a twisty piece of fiction...can't say I'd recommend it because it was almost TOO dark, and I really enjoy crime stories.  It had a very real feel to it, though; the main character seemed like it was based on an actual person - either the author or someone she knew well.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love this app! Comes in very handy as oppose to sitting in front of the TV waiting for the news :)
1932100660|5.0|i'M NOT DONE WITH IT YET AS I CONTINUE TO TAKE A LOT OF NOTES.  GREAT READ AND WILL KEEP GOING BACK TO IT AS A REFERENCE!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. THIS is the first time I have read from this author, and I really liked it. There were a couple of things that I did not care for in this book, but over all, it was very good.
B004WR125O|2.0|I bought the UWF-1 adapter to work with the Onkyo TX-8050 receiver on my home wireless network.  The configuration of the UWF-1 was really simple and it was working on the receiver basically immediately.  It showed that the wireless signal strength was at 35-40%  (it was not clear from what?... signal produced by the router?) at different times.  With that signal I was getting internet stations after the signal buffered to 100% (not every time it was doing it).  The main problem was when the unit got connected to a station and then got disconnected every 3-5 minutes and the signal was buffering again.  Sometimes it got connected, sometimes it did not.  So, I called Onkyo technical support and they told me it is the network issue with my home wireless system.  I am not sure I completely agreed with them as any other wireless device was working flawlessly at the same location.<br />So, I took a regular network repeater, linked it to the router, and connected it with CAT5 cable to my receiver.  The buffering speed to any network station was several times faster and connection was flawless without any interruption at all.  By the way, the cost for the 802.11 n repeater was even less than Onkyo UWF-1 adapter.<br /> I am not sure why UWF-1  did not work in my house without any errors-some people don't report issues with reliable connectivity.  It could be the unit I got is defective.  However, I believe the capability of the UWF-1 adapter is really limited.  I returned it back to Amazon.
B001LOPYHI|5.0|I just watched this on my kindle. It's the first movie I've watched. I wanted my 14 year old to see it. I was amazed at the picture quality! For an old movie it was great. The sound was very clear & we really enjoyed the whole experience. I am really impressed with my new kindle HD!
B007XIC1GI|4.0|And a self-centered ass. But what an engrossing tale. Quick read,  interesting stories... some not for the weak of heart. Must read for fans. Now I need the sequel from an older Manson.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Graphics are super. Enjoy the searches and getting my rewards. So far it does not feel like a child's game. Lot of fun.  Looking forward to the rest of the game.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this calculator. I love that the numbers are large so that you don't hit the wrong one by accident. I also love that it remembers everything I do just in case I don't. Which happens more often than I care to admit. I use this calculator all the time now.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|There are, of course, tons of game apps out there and most seem geared to a relatively shallow, pick-up-and-play mindset.  There's nothing wrong with that, but I was looking for something with a bit more depth.  Angry Birds and Cut the Rope, et al, are fun, but I can only play them in short stints.<br /><br />Based on positive reviews I decided to give Plague Inc. a try, and after downloading it I played for about 5 hours nonstop.<br /><br />If you can get past the creepy concept that you're trying to wipe out humanity, (which, c'mon, you can do it, it's just a game) this game hits a very sweet spot in that it's easy to learn, but has plenty of depth to add variety to each game.  Plus, there are 5 (or more?) plague types.  You start with Bacterial, then once you win a game on Normal difficulty you unlock Viral.  I haven't beaten Viral yet because my hosts die before the infection can spread!  I like that - it's this sort of detail that can make or break a game.<br /><br />Now, you can spend a bunch more money to unlock things, but the game says you can unlock everything just by playing.  I think it would cost something close to $20 to instantly buy everything.  I DID pay an extra $.99 to unlock a gene (or whatever) where I get extra DNA when popping a blue \\"cure\\" bubble.  Later in a game when the DNA is hard to come by, this has been helpful - I think it's 2-3 points per bubble, so it's not like it makes the game too easy, just helps a little bit.<br /><br />Anyway, if you're looking for something with more depth, this game is a ton of fun.  I'm going to keep an eye on this developer.
B00028HBKC|4.0|Wow is all I can say when I watch this movie.  Although my Christian upbringing made me aware of what went on in Christ Jesus' life, it was an awakening to see his torture and know it was for my sins.
1419705849|5.0|Great book series; would recommend and suggest anyone to buy it without even thinking twice; children love these books. Tumbs up!
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|The ladies in my family have enjoyed this movie and we replay it often.  The acting is great and the music is wonderful.
B0055SWM08|5.0|One of the best game apps ever - will give your brain a little workout.  Worth paying the 99 cents.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I love this game. they are all a little different. It's hard to find the exact one I am looking for.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I got this game on my I Pad and I fell in love with it. So I was looking for it on my kindle ever since I got it,  and its here! I wrote a reveiw on temple run on how better subway suffers is and how amazon should buy it. If you know what's good for you, buy it!!!!!! What do you have to lose, its free.
B0012NVGHU|5.0|Once is my very favorite movie and I have watched it many times. The songs and the singing are wonderful
1933952806|5.0|I was given this book as a Christmas present and am already halfway through it. It's informative and interesting, I'm learning about my actual camera and also a bit about photography in general, which is nice. I also enjoy the \\"My Recommendations\\" sections, especially for functions that I still don't quite understand. It's easy to read, flows well, and you can tell that the author really put a lot of time into making sure that it's comprehendable by photographers at any level without being too simplistic or too advanced. Thanks so much for a great guide!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This game is easy to learn and fun i just purchased the 5-6 player extension so more people can play.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|The Tudors series is wonderful television. I have read widely of the Tudor history so I am in on the details. The set is also beautifully packaged.
B0015DROBO|4.0|This book was tough to get into at first, but I am so glad I kept with it. Once I got hooked, I couldn't put it down. There seemed too be a loose end or two in the story, but nothing detrimental. Definitely reading the next in the trilogy.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|I used this to decorate an tote to make my grand daughter a toy box. It is lovely. It made the toy box.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|This movie was hilarious. It was well worth the money i paid to watch it. It had a good plot with many funny moments.
B00APUQRPC|3.0|slow but picks up and the end is good,I should have waited for a quieter night to watch it !
B0063IH60K|4.0|The pop up ads are a bit annoying but hey, for FREE it's great. I really don't see the need to buy the game.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|No need to concentrate just enjoy the witty repartee.  Not realistic but a good book for the beach or soaking in the tub.
B0058YPL66|5.0|This is one of the most amazing and tremendous serious of all times. It's plot, use of characters and breakthroughs in each episode leaves you crying for more and epic twisted story telling of all times. Using characters of story telling books that we all read &#34;Once upon a time&#34; was brilliant as it grabs the audience from the very first seconds because we all read those books, and we all associate from the start.<br /><br />Thank you to all the creators and congratulations to ABC for picking up a great series with an awesome story line.
B001CEE1YE|1.0|I couldn't play these DVD's on my TV, and opening the first DVD caused the plastic case to break. Wish there would be a notice that BluRay plays on only certain newer TV's
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Christan Bale has been far and away the best Batman in film.  He has kept the character close to how he was portrayed in the comic books.  This film has a bit of a campy ending but the action is first rate and Anne Hathaway in a cat suit certainly doesn't hurt the films aesthetics.
B001BR5NN0|5.0|A movie that will always hold up no matter how old it becomes?  One of the best character-driven, dialogue films ever.
B008YU0AOE|3.0|Being on my kindle makes them just a touch away.I carry my kindle every where even to the ATM machine
B0029QRA1U|5.0|I ordered this item for my husband for Christmas because he has an extensive album collection. This was the best gift ever for him. The turntable came in excellent time right before Christmas. Thanks for the prompt service.
B00A757EFW|1.0|I was very disappointed.  The &#34;lite&#34;  stops you in the middle of a game in the second level.  thumbs down.
B000B5XOYI|5.0|we received it on time, and think that everything is great and my husband loves the 18 hours of special features!
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This was the free app of the day. I didn't know a stick figure could be so much fun!  Thanks.
B00973902K|5.0|Instant gratification. Great tunes at a good price. I prefer to get my tunes on Amazon because they are easier to save and share than Itunes
B009YP9L7U|5.0|waking up married was a fun read. it was amusing and dramatic all at the same time. i dont relate to the main character but that is not what reading is about. its about enjoying what others see in their brain while writing and m.l. kelly saw a fun story unfolding. i hope that you enjoy megans story as much as i did. it was a depiction of what different aspects of marriage play a role in love being a strong denominator to hold things together.
B0052RDHTM|2.0|I love, love all Follett books.  However, this one was just long and not that engaging.  I found myself just glossing over words out of boredom several times, requiring me to force myself to go back and re-read.  I hope book two is better.
B000VHMF0A|5.0|Signature collection of work from a signature artist.  Everybody should have this album in their collection.  Even if you don't like some of the remastered tracks, the originals are there.  A gem to be sure.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas gift.  I thought the price was excellent and it was definitely shipped quickly. Thanks
B007EECSFA|5.0|I was so glad Kate Morton wrote another book.  I have read all her work and hang on every word. Each book ends in a way I would never have guessed. Her books are exceptional.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I purchased this season for a Christmas gift.  It was priced very well and will be much enjoyed. Arrived promptly.
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|This isn't as rip roaringly funny as the ads will try to make you believe.  However, it's alright to pass the time.  I lived in Boston until recently, so it's nice to see the city a bit.  Of course there's a scene in Fenway, cause all movies set in Boston need to have a scene in Fenway apparently.  That was too much.  As it is with so many comedies, it's funnier in the beginning then just gets boring once the plot kicks in.
B005LAIISA|5.0|I got this for my grandson for Christmas.  He was really excited to receive this dvd.  He will so enjoy it.
B001AR4K8K|5.0|Great movie and great cast.  It's a must watch for vampire lovers. One of my top favorite vampire movie. 2thumbs up.
B003L77G6A|5.0|I bought this for a Christmas gift for my son in law.  He loved it.  Good price and will be enjoyed.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Not just the temp, but radar and forecast.  You can set it to locate your position so it changes as you travel.
B003Y5H556|5.0|I purchased this for my son for Christmas. The price as excellent and I know he will enjoy the movie.
B00003XACV|5.0|I got this soundtrack/score before watching the movie. The movie won an academy award for Best Soundtrack and after listening to it you will know why.
B002ZG98FU|5.0|My daughter requested this movie for her collection.  She really loved it. I will be asking to borrow it later.
B00AE6SS5O|5.0|This is a great game.  There are hidden objects but it has puzzles, too.  I love Christmas so a game that incorporates that is good to me.  I think anyone would like this game.
0857680986|5.0|Didatical and with a lot of great tips and informations about draw and composition, worth the money you invested it!
044654759X|5.0|Nicholas Sparks just keeps putting them out there and knocking them out of the park. I love this book and can not wait to read the best of me which I just bought.
1933492953|5.0|I bought this by recomendation and didn't regret! A book with a great resources and infos about storyboard and composition.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|This is one of my favorite television shows.  I can't get enough of it and I dread the day the series is canceled.
B005K15SPG|5.0|For anyone who still buys CD and likes any Mumfird & Sons songs this is a great album. I liked all their songs on this CD which is rare for me.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|if you do not know how to sharpen a knife with a stone , then they are good , do not expect a razor edge.
B004SOR4H6|1.0|I don't really use Twitter but my nieces really like to use it so for that reason I will give it 1 star!
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|I think it was a great book. I wish that it did not end that way though. I wonder what book there is going to be next.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I loved following along on all of the adventures that Tom Sawyer took me on in this book, felt like I was right there.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Love the book and I hope you write more because I will always love and read your books till death
B006T3RM08|1.0|I was excited to get this. I had read the reviews and thought I would try it anyways.  Well, the reviews were right.  I put my keyboard and magic trackpad in the holder and it worked great - for the first few clicks.  Then, everytime I would go to click it it was like it was stuck and it wouldnt click.  I would have to take it out and put it back in.  I found that to be a bit of a pain so I am returning it today.  I am sad as the concept was excellent for what I need.  I think I will try the blueFin product next!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved this book i loved the writing style and it was easy to relate to because it think that everyone is searching for the special inside of them
B002VWNID6|3.0|although this is a brand new dvd, the clarity of the entire movie was spotty in certain scenes. also the movie stopped at a specific scene without completing the movie. when the situation of scene stoppage i realized that i had to eject the dvd and turn the dvd over to complete movie by reloading. there was no notice or printing on the dvd that i would have to eject and reload to watch the completed movie.<br /><br />i am very disappointed in the quality of this dvd and feel that i have wasted my money on the purchase.
B00AGOGOLE|1.0|I don't like it. Doesn't work. I'd give this app a negative bazillion rating. But I can't. Don't waste your money. Please fix this piece of s*** app. I hope you go to hell for makin such a horrid app. Please die.    With love,  Your ass
B00A9X9ORI|1.0|it was a total dissappointment.itwas confusing and left me thinking they will try to make a sequel out of this piece of crap.the actors should be ashamed to have lent their names to this waste of time.
B00A9C3RB8|1.0|I expected so much more from Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones. The story starts out pretty realistic and hard. Then, it just feels like they were running out of time, so jump to the happy ending. Howevet they couldn't cut the awkward attempts at oral sex. No way should this movie be rated PG-13. It should easily be R.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Harry Potter The Complete 8 Film Collection arrived promptly and was at a great price. The perfect gift the Potter fan.
B0088ZSKOC|3.0|Very useful, effective app that you can customize for length. Johnson's voice is soothing, and his method is thorough, particularly regarding the facial muscles, which are easy to overlook when trying to relax.<br /><br />I'd rate it 5 stars if it didn't override a wakeup app in the morning. Suggestion: add an option to close the app after a set amount of time.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|You know around 3/4 of the way through the book, I was like... so when is anything going to happen. So if u find yourself in a doldrum push through! Seeing... wow I forgot his- Charlie! Seeing Charlie develop mentally into a fantastic person Is amazing. Fantastic book!
B00AKOB7CG|4.0|I've used the single-area daily workout apps and was glad to see this addition to the series. The videos show correct form, and the written instructions are clear and useful. You can't customize the workout, but that's understandable in a free app and a good reason to pay the developer for the full version.<br /><br />Why not 5 stars? The workouts are silent except for the name of the next exercise. When you're on your belly doing one of the exercises, how are you supposed to keep track of repetitions? An audible count or metronome tone would be very helpful.
B006O6F932|5.0|Really nice,good price. Was larger than I had though and good quality,Stylish design.<br />My daughter loves it,plays with it every day.
B00AKO93JK|4.0|I was glad to see this addition to the useful Daily Workouts series combining different target areas into one workout. I tried the free version, and believe in paying the developer for the full version. After a bit of trouble installing it from the Amazon App Store, it downloaded fine and is running with no problem.<br /><br />The paid version includes most of the single-target exercises available in the other apps in this series (abs, arms, butt, cardio, legs) -- everything except the ball workout and the yoga.  As with the earlier apps, you can choose to target one area, select a workout length of 5, 7.5, or 10 minutes, choose one of 3 preset routines, start from your choice of exercise on the list, or make a custom routine. So far, you've bought five 99-cent apps for $3.99 and have less clutter on your screen.<br /><br />What's really new here is that you can now do a full-body routine. The default routine (available on the free version) is fine. With the paid version, you can also make a custom routine including up to 20 exercises from a list of about 85, sorted by target area. You can save the routine and select a workout length of 10, 20, or 30 minutes. Customizing helps me get a challenging workout without stressing my aging wrists and knees.<br /><br />For people new to this series: each exercise is demonstrated by a looping video of a fit young woman in fairly modest workout clothing. She models the correct form but doesn't explain it. Instructions are printed underneath. A woman's voice announces the name of the exercise, and then there is silence until the next exercise. You can turn off the sound.<br /><br />Why only 4 stars? There is no option to add a rhythmic sound to signal the reps. That would be a useful addition for an update. Without that sound, it is hard to keep the rhythm during exercises where your position doesn't let you watch the screen.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was good I really like the when Greg was so nervous about the dance. You should never freak out about something
B009YG2ND8|5.0|Excellent rpg.  Controls, clarity, fun factor, and overall play is outstanding. Would highly recommend this game to any rpg lovers.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Cooooooooooooooooooooooool its awesome to play this game this game is a must-have game<br />You can't play another game like this
1419705849|4.0|I bought this book for my 12 year old son who has all the Wimpy Kid books. I enjoy them too and as soon as he put this one down I read it. Overall, it was funny; although I didn't think it was one of the best in the series, I wasn't disappointed. My son, however (perhaps because he is at the age to be going to middle-school dances\\" firmly stated that this is the second-best book in the whole series, second only to the original.
0062213423|4.0|The pages weren't torn, they smelt new even! Just the spine at the bottom was hit by something. It might've been the shipping but its brand new and I love it so much &#60;3
0316078913|3.0|If I am not mistaken this is an earlier collection by David Sedaris that has been reprinted with new stories from other collections added in. I own several of his essay collections, but I was disappointed in this one. The first essay about his experiences as an elf was very good, but after that they kind of disintegrated into too-long, too-morbid stories that just didn't hold my interest. When you get to the new stories that were added in (ex: Jesus Shaves, which came from another collection and which never fails to have tears of laughter rolling down my face) it picked up a bit, but overall I was glad I got this for a very reduced Kindle price (because I have read most of those essays already). Overall, this book leads me to say something I never thought I'd say about David Sedaris.....\\"Meh.\\"
B001NHNG64|1.0|After watching the movie I decided to start reading the books. I must say that I am quite thrilled. Child's action packed writing keeps the reader hooked from beginning to end. And Jack Reacher continues to evolve into the action hero of legend. Can't wait to read number three.
B0041KVZ1I|4.0|This new vinyl re-issue is much better sounding than any recent presses of Abbey Road, one of the most popular albums of all time. Compared to an original copy, it's a tad harsh, probably because it was sourced from digital files. My copy was nice and quiet, and well centered. Packaging is basic, pretty much like Abbey Road always was; the Apple logo on the record looks nice. An original copy would set you back 80 to 100 dollars, so this is not a bad deal all things considered
B0063IH60K|4.0|great free app it passes the time easy to play won't stretch the mind but still a game and as mentioned its free!!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is so fun and awesome! Me and my mom play it ALL the time. thumbs up!!! best thing

1932100660|5.0|for those who are searching for an ultimate health, this book will help you to understand and learn how it can be done. You must eliminate all animal products first, then beginning to eat more raw foods gradually. No one should ever die from &#34;heart-attack&#34; again!
B00AFWEPVI|1.0|This has to be the worst camera app I've ever used.  First there is no way for you to delete or review any of your pictures. The pictures you do take are a horrible quality.  I understand why it's the best value.  It's because it's a useless app.  Do NOT waste your money.  There are definitely much better apps out there to use as a camera app.  I guess you get what you pay for.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|I am an old fellow now, but still love good animations. This one makes the grade. Boy meets girl, and eventually fall for each other - but not before each marks their territory, and overcoming adversity! Great for the whole family. Enjoy.
0395389496|5.0|I read this book to my second graders. It was a beautiful story filled with colorful pictures. I was expecting a paper back book and to my surprise I received a hard copy with an Award seal. The DVD was a great complement to the book!

B0018QQQK8|5.0|Great book! The movie is totally different than the book. Would recommend this book to anyone. I love Nicholas Sparks!
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|I love this app I think that zeptolab has really outdone themselves<br />there should be more levels<br />great graphics really cute and fun<br />well worth the 99&cent;
B008OOYALE|5.0|this game is amusing, fun, and easy. waiting to see what kind of egg u created is exciting in my opinion.<br />good way to spend some couch time.<br />GAme Works great on my kindle fire...but freezes more often then not<br />On my droid. Hope they get the glitches out soon..<br />A turn off animation button would probably help a lot.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I love Spider Solitaire.<br />What you get here is a freebie without the frills.<br />Works for me, good game for the times I want to play.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Started a little slow with the Navy SEAL training detail, but when it picks up shortly after that it really takes off.  An excellent read, gripping story and well written.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Totally engaging, I couldn't put it down. I can't wait to read the sequels. First book I've read in ages.
B007T99ENE|4.0|A really interesting fictional narration of life in England in the early '70s, combining mystery with real life.very good writing.

B0085KGGHI|5.0|This is a great piece of work takes you back to late 70's early 80's. The clothing, hairstyles, and youth of our great biues and rock legends will really take you back to a different place in time. Loved every minute of it.

B006YW6KX4|4.0|Great Wm. Inge play which won the Pulitzer Prize, here, in a wondrous film adaptation.  Small town Kansas Labor Day picnic and parade with the cozy provincial residents affected by a good looking, but somewhat woebegone,  stranger who comes to town, looking for a job. He is William Holden in a great role, for which, he is probably too old, but, in which. he is dazzling.  He lopes in, bumming a ride on the train, and makes all the women in town sit up and take notice. They include  sisters, dreamy local beauty queen Kim Novak, and studious, tomboyish Susan Strasberg, their mother, Betty Field, as well as  the sexually frustrated high school teacher, dynamically portrayed by Rosalind Russell. Cliff Robertson is Novak's fiance and Arthur O&#34;Connell is Russell's beau. So, it's filled with great performances.<br /><br />A splendid film of '55, an idealized picture of Americana that was a model for later films such a PEYTON PLACE,  THE LONG HOT SUUMER and many others; but this was the first and best of that genre.<br /><br />The blu-ray is gorgeous, a perfect looking recreation of Technicolor as it was presented by Columbia studios in the fifties, which means completely different that the same process at any other studio.<br /><br />Great score with a memorable dance sequence with &#34;Moonglow/ theme from Picnic&#34; throbbing on the soundtrack.
1419705849|5.0|My 11 year old granddaughter loves all of these books...I buy her each one as it comes available...She has received this from Santa as well though...:)
B004EPYZPS|2.0|Enjoyable, but the output of director who was a kid who did 8mm stuff when he was a teenager, and grew up to do the same thing with a trillion dollar budget. Speilberg found someone who has the same beginnings as he, but none of the story telling abilities.  And the story is pretty silly.<br /><br />It has a lot of very gripping scenes, but, at the end, it's like you were taken on a thrill ride at the amusement park, and you have been on way too many of them over your lifespan to have this particular one have any impact.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|The best hidden object game out there! I was hooked from the start. Just wished it was a longer game play for the money. Can't wait for the secual to come out!

0307730697|3.0|In most of Fearless, the reader is left somewhat confused and wondering which honors separate this SEAL from the rest of his specialized peers to the point of needing an entire book.  The final 75 pages the reader is clued into Mr. Brown's uniqueness, but quite honestly, even though these characteristics are impressive, they are not all that historically legendary.  As always with subjects of this nature, the reader can only reflect upon his/her own life, but as far as books go, there are other honorary military biographies I would recommend over Fearless.  With that said, I enjoyed the read and am grateful to include Mr. Brown's story within my library of military histories.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved all the books, very interesting and hard to put down. I just wish good stories didn't end so quickly.
B007V65R54|3.0|How stupid is this rating process.  I gave the book as a gift.  It was clearly ordered as such.  How could I have read it?<br /><br />I picked this rating because I had to pick one, and it was in the middle.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book has just been all kinds of wonderful to read. The good, bad, ugly - all of it, just amazing. The way the author has shaped the book into letters and developed the characters put you into their world.<br /><br />My favorite has been Charlie, though. His straight-forward, awkward, blunt, confused, naïve character has been so relatable and simple, you can't dislike him. He, along with the other characters, of course, make this book so amazingly profound, filling it with the abundance of knowledge and wisdom that is expected for you to gain in high school, but few actually have the opportunity to.<br /><br />This coming of age novel presents so much for any and every reader who is willing to learn - no heart or soul is left unturned and unresponsive. Whether it is the urge to do or not do something, or just a pensive moment about your life, The Perks of Being a Wallflower can, should, and will change you. I fully recommend this to every reader. However, I believe this is best received by the reader who not only reads the words, but the intent of the characters and the author. And for those who believe that something can be learned everywhere.
B0000AQVCL|1.0|To me,music is a two part enigma;the music itself and then the lyrics. If the music is awesome it can overtake bad lyrics. However,in the case of Jet,the average music of this band cannot make me overlook the childish,lame,unimaginative lyrics to all of their songs. I know grade school kids that can write better words.Example:\\"4,5,6,come on and get your kicks\\". Seriously? Go to any lyrics based web site and look at their lyrics. Truly pathetic. This band is in serious need of a lyricist. They would be better off in a singer who screams loud so you couldn't understand what he's saying but he sings loud and clear and the words are so bad I'm embarrassed to sing them out loud. So-so music and lame-ass lyrics give this band a one star rating. Hey Jet, here's some lyrics you could use:\\"4,5,6 your band has awful lyrics\\" Or,'Not a 5 but a 1 star 'cause your lyrics are below sub-par\\"
030745455X|5.0|great book. mystery and thriller . Great heroine and hero . loveed it. Unable to put the book down. excellent
B00ADIT8U2|3.0|It is a good game for the price. I have paid more money for far worse. Not real fancy but it works.

B008IJT0CE|5.0|This app  is really versatile.  Most people seem to use it for sleeping (which is great), but I also use it on Campfire setting and put my device on my electric fireplace heater.  Add some soft music.  You have a comforting winter retreat.  Love this app.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Your best score is constantly updated so you can compete against yourself...or with an internet connection you can compete against others.
B009NCM248|5.0|This is probably their best album, I really like this one a lot. Love Corey Taylor's voice, he has a great voice and the albm stands up as well as any of the Slipknot stuff and I love them. If this is your first one, enjoy, then go and get the rest of their stuff and if you don't have any of the Slipknot stuff, go out and get All Hope Is Gone and play both of these together nonstop!
B000SEI230|5.0|Great read. So exciting I could not put it down. Wonderful story.I would highly recommend this book to any one
B009SSGBOE|5.0|Donald Fagen is simply one of a kind, love the way he writes, sings, plays, way beyond cool period. Love Steely Dan, and his solo stuff never disappoints, though sometimes it's hard to tell them apart, he does what he does the way he does, which that unto itself, is what it is. It would be great to have a new Steely Dan album, but until then, buy this one. I love listening to this one at night with the love of my life and a nice glass of wine and kicking back and letting it take us to wherever each song tkes us.
B00280LYIM|5.0|This series keeps getting better and better.  Very thrilling and entertaining.  I could not put it down.  Now I have to read the last one.
B007STBUIW|5.0|Seeing is believing, I couldn't believe the way it looked, it was like being in the middle of it, being there. One of our favorite movies of all time, it is what it is, you have to love it. Waited a long time for it to come out on Blu-Ray, it was worth the wait. Just go out and get this movie and kick back and wait to get bitten!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Really enjoyed the writer's style.  Made a simple who-done-it into a compelling novel.  Would recommend it to any &#34;happily&#34; married couple.
B008ZTVQLA|5.0|Ian Hunter is simply great, no other words can describe him. He is a great singer songwriter, bottom line. I have been a fan for many years, ever since I first heard Mott The Hoople. I have been buying his solo albums from day one and never have been disappointed, and you won't either. If this will be your first on, this is as good as a start as any of the others. Once Bitten, pun intended, you won't regret it. Buy this, this is one of his better ones.
B007T2XC7A|5.0|Absolutely love Norah's work, and this is no different with the latest offering.  She continues to stick to her roots and create something completely her own.  Backed by excellent and gifted musicians, Norah continues to present very pleasing tunes!

B007FJFDXS|4.0|Most of the 'mazes' are fun and enjoyable. Then there are some that are fun and exasperating.<br />If you like that combo you might like this version of the game. Then there are the times I go<br />back to 'improve' my grade and don't &^%#$#^. But some how it is habit forming. Sometimes the<br />game loves to change orientation from portrait to landscape in the middle of the game.<br />This is one reason for not being 4 stars.<br />Take it as it is and have some fun with it. Got this game as FAOTD.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|I haven't Played this yet.  New Kindle Fire for Christmas and it's going to take some time to fully evaluate it.  Need nore instructions.

B004NS710C|5.0|...kept you on the edge of your seat :) Would recommend it for a good night at the movies...at home!
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|I'm no movie critic but I know what I like. The &#34;evilness&#34; begins at the beginning and continues almost to the end. There was no light at the end of the tunnel...until. So for me, it was too much bad, even for a fantasy. If you are like me and need a little bit of good to show through you probably won't like it much more than I did. The story was interesting but certainly fantastic. (aren't they all). I thought the acting was pretty good and the characters played the roles as one would expect. But hey, I'm no movie critic, I just did't love it.
B000EWBKK8|1.0|I ordered this as a gift for my husband. He opened it and played it and nothing, its almost as if the disc is blank! I tried playing it in all of our blu ray players but again nothing! I am very disappointed with this product and it is too late to return so I am not only out the money that  I spent on the movie but  I am unable to view this movie!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Smart show-excellent cast. I was hooked from the start. Every episode is exciting. I can't wait to see season two.
B005EHQGTS|3.0|The setup is a little difficult unless you are fairly tech savvy, particularly if you are trying to access a work computer on a LAN.
B008X6N1OA|5.0|this movie is so funny! it entertains everyone of all ages it doesn't have anything inappropriate in it unlike some other pg movies and it is full of features and I mean fulllllll! this is family friendly and I would recommend it to everyone
B0017XD3OY|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time! The action and drama are great. Get this movie right now you won't regret it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book did not disappoint. I wasn't sure what to expect (since I don't know anyone who has read this nor seen the movie), but I quickly got into each of the characters and their crazy, complicated lives from the very beginning. The main character is completely lovable, and tells a wonderful, funny, and insightful story of what it's like growing up from an outsider's perspective. Good life story with lots of insight.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Jodi Piccoukt has done it again!  Grab the reader from<br /> page one and not let go even after the last word!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|After reading several reviews, I thought I would give it a whirl. Anyone who states or gives it less stars has either been in a relationship like this or is embarrassed because they have never encountered such hot mind blowing lust that is displayed here. I couldn't put the book down. I found myself wanting more and more. Great writing. Really draws you in.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Best book I've read in a long time. I highly recommend it to everyone. High action and very entertaining. Five stars!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This is an all time classic. Great for all ages. It is one you can watch over and over again.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Really good story. I had a hard time getting into it but once I got past the first few chapters, I got more involved. Lots of surprises. Kept me guessing.
B005LAIGW8|2.0|Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is billed as a sequel to 2007's Ghost Rider starring Nicholas Cage as Johnny Blaze and Peter Fonda as the Devil. But the producers apparently couldn't get Peter Fonda to reprise his role as the dark lord, so they got Ciaran Hinds (\\"Bill Clinton\\" in the TV miniseries Political Animals) to fill in for Fonda. Other than those two actors, I didn't recognize any other cast member, and neither will you.  The producers  apparently didn't want to bog the budget down with a lot of expensive acting talent.<br /><br />Nicholas Cage reprises his role as Johnny Blaze, a small time motorcycle stunt rider who makes a deal with the devil that makes him vessel of a powerful biker demon. But gone is any sense that Blaze is the modern equivalent of Evel Knieval  with packed stadiums and throngs of fans. This movie finds Johnny Blaze somewhere in Europe (it's never really clear to me) battling evil minions hell-bent on kidnapping the Devil's illegitimate son from a bunch of priests who belong to a heavily armed religious sect that is vaguely Catholic. A wine loving Afro-French priest recruits Blaze to protect the child from the forces of evil. From that point on it's a lot of death metal music and flaming vehicles.<br /><br />The actions sequences weren't nearly as well crafted as I remember them being in Ghost rider (2007). The sequel wasn't nearly as visually impressive as I expected. Of course I saw the first movie in a theater, and watched the newer film on the big flat screen at home. I'll stipulate that Spirit of Vengeance was advertised as a 3D movie and I didn't see it in that format. Maybe it looked better in 3D. But the creature himself just seemed stiff and moved more like a Frankenstein monster than the savagely aggressive and more nimble creature in the first movie. Also, Ciaran Hinds's Devil seems to have only a fraction of Peter Fonda's supernatural power and must resort to hiring thugs and Euro-ninjas, and transporting himself on trains (why is the lord of evil taking public transport?) and in automobiles. In fact he appears to be a lot less powerful than the Ghost Rider himself. It's explained away in exposition, but I chalk it up to lazy writing. In the end he must resort to fleeing in a Porsche SUV while Blaze gives chase in a flaming truck.<br /><br />I have no idea if Peter Fonda was even offered the chance to reprise his role. But I like to think that Fonda read the screenplay and decided to pass so as to preserve what's left of his career. The screenplay was the weakest part of the movie. The dialogue sounds like it could have been written 9th grade fan of Metallica  who asked for auto shop only to have his councilor stick him in creative writing. The absence of Fonda was a major loss. He has a lot of personal charm which made his devil all the scarier.<br /><br />Ghost Rider (2007) was at least a fun interpretation of the Marvel Comics character, and had a certain supernatural logic to it. The producers of Spirit of Vengeance decided to ignore everything good from the first movie and start from near scratch. So there's no jumping his Harley over 20 busses or Carpenters music. Johnny Blaze seems to have lost his quirkiness and just gotten dark and bitter. In short, Spirit of Vengeance is not nearly as fun a movie as its predecessor.(why is the lord of evil taking public transport?) and in automobiles. In fact he appears to be a lot less powerful than the Ghost Rider himself. It's explained away in exposition, but I chalk it up to lazy writing.

B00A7CI82I|5.0|I'm a Jason Borne diehard.  I was reluctant at first but it is a great movie.  Action packed.  I would absolutely recommend.
B004SBX112|5.0|Entertaining.  A ton of different scenarios to play...seemingly endless. Makes my time on the exercise bike go by in a flash even
B0096HID5M|1.0|I thought i would give it a whirl.  should have rented it first.  I never would have bought it.  Don't bother.
B001AQT0RC|5.0|Jodie Foster does a wonderful convincing job with a solid character and script.<br /><br />Is the storyline far fetched? A bit. But even 10 years ago did you ever envision what you would be doing with a cell phone? A mini looking flat/skinny looking laptop called a tablet? The large flat screen tv I am sitting here watching football on is something  I never would have imagined watching in my own home with a picture that is as clear as being there. I can go on. Tech advances SO quickly these days...why not the premises in the film?  WATCH IT!<br /><br /> I can watch this movie endlessly.
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas gift for my Mom. She was very excited and couldn't wait to watch it.
B006M4RN3U|4.0|This was an album that really stood out as a sound that has emerged from a time long forgotten. I actually discovered this band long after the band hit it big and that is probably because I am one of those people that is a music purist who is afraid of venturing away from everything that is full of talent. Then when I found out that I was completely out of the loop in terms of new music while I didn't hate 'Fun' I decided to explore their work.<br /><br />'Fun' is a very unique band they show mainstream at the same time originality in their songs. The songs are catchy and enjoyable and at the same time remind me of vocals used by bands like Queen, ELO and for some reason I hear a slight Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young. Get a good listen to the song 'Why Am I The One' and you may understand what I am getting at. While the album is no where near perfect, I really see big things from this trio in the coming years, usually I am right so hopefully the streak will continue.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|I enjoy this game a lot! It can be a little frustrating though, but so are most games. It's a good game just not an amazing game which is why I only have it 4 stars. I would recommend this is you like the game cut the rope!

B0024FAR5M|5.0|I bought this dvd set for my son-in-law who loves this show, but can't get it on his TV channel lineup.  He liked it a lot.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I loved the variety of action and puzzle, as I don't care for puzzle only game's. This one has a great creepy atmospheric feel to it and is easy to work through with the hint button. When is the sequel coming?.. and why can't I get to the sneak peek shown for it on the homepage?! :(
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|I gave this DVD set as a gift to my son-in-law who likes this show, but can't get it on his TV channel lineup.  He liked it.
B0026P3G12|5.0|What a voice.  I put the cd player on repeat and listen over and over to this great voice singing music that is easy to listen to.
B001EBYM8A|5.0|This dramatic action movie entertained both my teenagers as much as it did me on my third viewing.  My son (13) usually hates movies that are a little old because of the production values, and didn't want to watch this, but we all loved it.  Plus, as Chicagoans, it's nice that the details of the production were accurate and really looked like Chicago.  This movie really ages well.
B007N8RULO|5.0|When waiting for something else, I like to play spider sometimes.  Spider is my favorite computer game and doesn't take too long...

1892005034|5.0|Excellent tools to speak your mind without causing conflict .  Also allows you to be aware of your communication methods and to improve on them.  Good book!
B003LZ5B7S|5.0|Channel surfing one day i saw Dr Who on the BBC and decided to see what it was. Needless to say now have watched 80 some episodes. I was raised on Star Trek from its beginning but have to say Dr Who is light years ahead of Star Trek. The changing of the cast and the story lines are pure genius. The acting is incredible. If you are a si-fi fan this is a must see but start with the first episode and also look for past Christmas specials that are not included. You will need to figure out where to watch them in relation to where you are in the episodes.
B0058VW36U|1.0|Sorry this is not A review but I really want this game but Im not allowed to buy games. Please make this A App Of The Day for the Kindle Fire. &quot; Please&quot;<br />  ~PeetaLover123
B000003TA4|5.0|Had to buy this one after seeing the dvd on the making of the album. Really cool to watch Butch Vig explain how they record. I love that technical stuff and of course the album rocks. :^)
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|My daughter says the book is &#34;REALLY good!&#34; - usually I'm not so good at picking out the good ones so thanks for the suggestion Amazon!!

B000I9U9A4|5.0|sound quality, picture quality were excellent using Amazon Video Prime video streaming. The subscript clearly identified the era in which the drama took place. Sequence of events was nonstop from beginning to end.
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|this book was the best of the series so far, because it had historical facts and a high level of suspense that I loved
B004I2K4E8|5.0|I can't get enough of this great concert! It has quickly become my favorite DVD. Alfie Boe is the greatest!
B003Y74AZ2|5.0|I love my silicone phone case! its not too bulky but diffidently does the job when protecting my phone. The back design is neat but not too flashy. I got exactly what I was expecting
B00A0NOF7G|4.0|Enjoyed the playfulness of the book.  A cute little read when you aren't looking for anything too serious.  Has a few typos and punctuation issues but not enough to make stop reading it once I started.
B00992CF6W|5.0|First of all, the computer version of minecraft is great, and this version is close behind. This version only needs a few more:<br />Blocks<br />Mobs<br />Server like multiplayer
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Absolutely LOVE that both characters have flaws and need each other to work through them. I have been so tired of one person \\"saving\\" the other time and time again.<br /><br />Great book!
B003SI9WYG|5.0|Always a classic. Great for all ages and a real pleasure to watch over and over again. The music, the voice overs and the art direction of TNBC still can not be duplicated, though many have tried! If you haven't seen this yet, you really are missing out.
0345803493|5.0|Liked the speed of the drama. Enjoyed the characters. I think it does the whole \\"super rich guy loves lame girl\\" genre extremely well. Best version of that genre I've read.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|It was going to be a hard task to live up to Sigh No More. And at first, when I played the album, I though &#34;well this sure wont&#34;. But after listening to it constantly in the car, I can say that I enjoy it even more than SNM now. The sound direction and emotional level that they took this album to is unparalleled. Marcus really poured his heart and soul into every song and it shows with every second that is played. I enjoy it so much that it is hard for me to even begin to think of which song I enjoy most on the album because all are completely different, engaging and unique.
0345803485|5.0|Liked the speed of the drama. Enjoyed the characters. I think it does the whole \\"super rich guy loves lame girl\\" genre extremely well. Best version of that genre I've read.
B0030MM68O|5.0|Im not familiar with too many women directors. But I was shocked to find out that one had made one of the best war films to come a long in a long time. Funny, Terrifying, suspenseful, heart wrenching and real, this film delivered on every level. And the end, though simple, really paints a portrait of the reality a lot of our service men and women go through. This is a must see for any and everyone.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|If you are an arcade gamer, than you would know the classic game Galaga. Radiant HD runs that over. This brings a classic into a modern day version, with incredible asteroid field levels, and various lasers, bosses and enemies as well. Just a great game. A must have for any Android and Amazon user.
161293112X|5.0|excellent service, fast, reliable , right on time, thank you  I would recommend this seller to all who are interested<br />  A Christmas Carol is a an all time family favorite, but my oldest daughter who is living on her own requested this for Christmas this year, we gladly got it for her
B0086700CM|4.0|When I sit down and think of the best mobile games of all time, Temple Run instantly comes to mind. Simply one of the greatest games of all time on any platform, for any age. One thing I have noticed. (and why I gave it four stars) was it always seems that android games lag behind the feature heavy iOS apps, and I am a die hard Android fan boy. Love Amazon for having this in their market, it's just a point of view. Great game though.
B004P12SSW|1.0|Had a chance to catch up with this movie last night on ABC Family.  I remember seeing the commercials when it was released in theaters and was excited about going to see it, but somehow, never got to get there.  I'm glad I saw it on tv.  While the musical numbers and Christina's voice were wonderful, the movie itself was not very good.  The dialogue, awful.  Love story, weak. I was impressed by Christina's talent and Cher looks good.  What it did do for me is give me more confidence about my hope to be a screenwriter one day.  Because if this movie could be made with such talented stars with the awful excuse for dialogue that was used, I should be successful.  When I went to bed last night there was a part of me that did want to buy it for my collection, because I did like the musical numbers.  But then the sane part of me reminded me that I just saw it for free on ABC Family, so it will be on again.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Loved that it was the app of the day, and enjoy it on all of my android devices. Would recomend to any of my friends or family. Even without the app of the day I would have bought this. Very fun and ad-free version is the best! Thanks Amazon.
1451695195|5.0|Similar to all other NDE accounts that I've read giving this book credibility and validity particularly coming from an MD.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I love Les Mis, and I have been excited for the movie to come out since I heard that they were making it. I dragged my husband an hour away from where we live to go see it on Christmas Eve because I wanted to be one of the first.<br />I didn't want to get the album before seeing the movie so I purchased it afterwards. I think it is funny that it says &#34;Highlights From the Motion Picture&#34; because it is almost every single song. While listening to it I can still see the big screen and it inspires me to go out and see it again. I still like to listen to the original broadway cast, but this is a great rendition! Highly recommended.
1423113497|5.0|Wonderful heartwarming book !  My daughter loved it!  Wonderful series of books, great for any age! Very entertaining on a long trip!
B00913DPW2|1.0|This explains it all: ?????? Didn't understand the game after a few minutes, so I just deleted it. Extremely boring to my personal taste.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I enjoy the in depth storyline and little side stories,I expected it to be to gruesome but it had just the right amount, can't wait to read the next.
B00542USJW|5.0|My fiance loved this movie when he was growing up. I got this for him and he still loves it especially on blu ray.
B0050R0XPA|5.0|Nice Christmas gift, my grandson has several Lego winter village displays.  He is only 8 and the box says 12+, but he had no problem putting it altogether
B002M2T1UO|4.0|I worked hard to find a reasonably priced set and my boyfriend flipped out when he unwrapped his gift. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the original plastice wrap was torn and it looked as if the set may have been opened before.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|I love this game however if you want to play very long it can get very expensive...I deleted for that reason.
B001P9KR8U|4.0|I WAS SUPRISED WHEN A FORMER FRIEND THOUGHT I HAD THIS MOVIE, BUT BEING SOOO BIG HEARTED, AND NEVER HAVING WATCHED THE MOVIE, I DIDNT THINK TWICE ON WHERE TO GET A GOOD PRICE ON THIS MOVIE AND HELP A FRIEND OUT, I WENT STRAIGHT TO AMAZON, AND FOUND ONE AT A GREAT PRICE, ANY MOVIE YOU CAN IMAGINE IS HERE FOR THE TAKING AT A GREAT PRICE...AMAZON...YOUR GREAT!  MOVIE WAS IN PERFECT CONDITION!

B004OT6NTK|5.0|The Ewok attack from Star Wars is a great addition to the Star Wars Saga. Every part is always there in Star Wars Legos.
B007FQDPL8|5.0|I just recently came into the True Blood fold, and am making up for lost time. This series is by turns sexy, dramatic, and tears streaming down your face funny. If you're a fan of vampires, laughing, and paranormal sexiness this series is for you!
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|We got this set as soon as it was released. My husband and I are both fans of the books and the show.<br /><br />One of the really wonderful things about this is that there is an option to have information about the characters and their houses onscreen, while you learn the players.<br /><br />Overall I love this series and can't wait for Season 3!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Wow in a be honest there is a couple of sections where it's boring and confusing. However if you keep reading you won't be able to put down the book. I'm just glad the couple I wanted to stay together did.
0307716511|5.0|It is rare that a book can draw me in and keep me guessing.  This one did.  The style in which the story is told is different.  First person is interlaced with remembered emails and phone conversations.  The reader knows there is more to this story than is being told by the narrator, and I found that intriguing.  It had me guessing up to the last pages.  It left me stunned.  The writing is wonderful.  Many times I stopped the reading to admire the way a description had been crafted, or the choice of a perfect word in conveying what a hundered words never would. Well worth the time you will hoard to finish the book.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Absolutely love these kind of love stories! Definitely recommend to anyone that enjoys reading about this sort of stuff. :)
B009HV2JT8|1.0|This movie has good effects and if your into scify you'll probably like it, maybe love it! As for the rest of you...spend your money on another flick!
B003O86FMW|5.0|The most amazing book series I've read! I absolutely love it no doubt at that I just love the hole think from beginning to the end
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Excellent movie. I highly recommend watching it - all actors superb, story is entertaining, well written script. Joseph Gordon Levitt looks weird Bruce-Willis-ified though.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|This has become one of my favorite book series, it has very real and complex characters. I cannot read the Twilight series anymore, because this is just better. Definitely some adult content, but a great read.

B005COO1X6|5.0|I really liked this short story, but I really do wish it was longer. It was like reading a book and getting to the end and the rest of the book is missing. It left me wanting more and to me personally that means it was a very good story. I have several of Stephen King 's books, and this story is now one of my favorites. I would recommend it to everyone!!

B0057ZAA6W|5.0|TRAINSPOTTING is an excellent story about addiction, and the chaotic hell it can cause. It has plenty of instances of characters plunging into the depths of heroin-induced degradation, including the hideous neglect of a baby by its \\"parents\\". Also, Robert Carlyle plays an extremely menacing, psychopathic rotter that should have won an award for sheer eeevil! That said, it must be mentioned that TRAINSPOTTING is also wickedly funny. The incredibly nasty, public toilet scene is priceless! Ewan Mcgregor's role is the most accessible, making him the moral center of the film, though he must pay a great price for possible redemption. This movie was made by a young, fiery Danny Boyle, before he became a bigshot, megastar director...

B003MC5AV2|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book. This isn't exactly a you-can-read-for-a-month book. It's more like a one sitting kind of book. It's a light, enjoyable book. It has a romantic sense and I look forward to reading her other books.
0316228532|5.0|&#34;The Casual Vacancy&#34; Great Book.  My daughter loves J.K. Rowling and her writting.  Glad I was able to get it for her.  Thanks.
B005LAII12|5.0|by far the best movie i have ever watched in my entire life, cant stop watching it over and over
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This book was dowloaded to my kindle from amazon and so the quality was good. This book is a good read.

140053271X|5.0|It came in only three days on Christmas no less. it came in the original box and everything. i couldn't be happier with my grandmas new Nook.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book took my breath AWAY. I could not put it down. Once you start reading it you will fall IN LOVE with the characters. I most certainly laughed and almost shead a tear but this book is a 100% 5/5 stars. If you dont enjoy this book even in the slightest..something is wrong.
0784011176|4.0|love this movie and this version looks excellent on my television. however, the subtitle s explaining ada' s sign language is missing.
B009O2XY12|3.0|SO FOR A FREE GAME ITS OK THIS REVIEW WOULD BE BAD IF I PAID FOR IT. ITS FUN BUT AIM NO GOOD AND JUST LIKE A LOT OF FACEBOOK GAMES YOU HAVE TO HAVE ENERGY SO IF YOUR STUCK ON A LEVAL YOU ONLY GET TO TRY LIKE 3 TIMES THEN YOUR OUT OF ENERGY AND HAVE TO PAY 1.00 TO BUY MORE OR COME BACK A FEW HOURS LAGTER ONC ENERGY IS BUILT UP

B009HQ9UHC|4.0|Good for a mechanical  engineering student. I like the dynamics of all the accessories. It can be a bit frustrating at times.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Good time killer, you can do this while watching TV,<br />or if you are listening to your music. What more could<br />You Want .
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Love her story and what a gift. So glad she got discovered as she deserves it and it should teach us all it is never too late.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book easy to read. Can't wait to continue the series of the hunger games. I just love all the adventures.
B008YW5RH2|4.0|gave it to my son for Christmas.  He enjoys the game but can not get the slam feature to work.  He tries to buy a slam and it will not work.  Frustrating.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The second book was just as great as the first!! I can`t wait to get to the next!<br />My only suggestion for improvement would be that the Panem District info be included in the \\"x-ray\\" referencing option for reading via Kindle.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I played this game in on sitting, I was so enthralled with the graphics, the storyline, and the music. Fun and challenging puzzles to solve. My only issue is that the piano game seemed to be buggy, maybe it was just me. All round a fun game!
B008476HBM|4.0|I watched  the  movie and expected the book to be much the same. The book has way too much talk in it, hardly anything is described in any other way than by someone remarking upon it. But I liked the story overall, and I thought the authors view on pride was interesting. The characters are believable and somewhat relatable. Some parts were hard to understand because the  language is outdated, and I wasn't always sure who was speaking. Only that someone always was. But because  of the social nature of the novel, I guess that works.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|He is a master at building suspense. There was much that was unexpected and shocking surprises. I could not put it down.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Best book I've read in a very long time. Definitely makes me appreciate the wonderful and caring man in my life!
B000W91RUG|5.0|love this show and so does my soon to be step daughter. she was very pleased to get this and has already watched it twice
B00A17AD36|5.0|I Completely Love The Weeknd And I Flipped Out When I Found The Album Trilogy On Amazon, My Only Thing Is Not The Album Itself But How The Price Jumped From 3.99 To 9.99, Cause I Was Gonna Buy It This Week. And Then Why Buy It Here When You Can Go To Datpiff.com And Dowload It For Free?  The Album Is Great But I'm Not In Love With The Price Jump.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|great fun with the kids and even on my own . some are really challenging. look forward to new levels
B003O86FMW|5.0|Captivating! Dying to read last book! This is a great read for youth and adults. I really enjoyed the different genre and the suspense of it all.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I've played a lot of these type games and this one is among the best. The puzzles are typical but not too easy and the story line is engaging. I would have liked it to be longer but only because I was enjoying it. It's actually a decent length. I have played quite a few that were much shorter. This game is worth the money.
B005EI86JU|5.0|I wanted something a little more than the guide that came with my D7000, and bought this.  I like Young's recommedations, although I don't always take them.<br /><br />I got the Kindle version because I wanted to be able to carry it with me along with other manuals.  My Kindle broke and I'm using the Kindle app on an iPad.  It probably would work on an iPhone, but the screen size might be limiting.
B0070UFMOW|4.0|I've had an E11 for a couple of years now, and loved it.  After listening to my laptop audio-out through the E11 for a long time, the built-in headphone jacks sound like garbage.  So I wanted to upgrade to the E17, mostly for the optical input.<br /><br />Sound quality is better than the E11, with both the USB input and optical.  Using the 3.5MM jack with my iPod seems about the same, but the E17 has more power, so it sounds louder/cleaner.<br /><br />Overall I really like the functions and the sound, but I am removing one star for the configuration of the buttons.  One of the best things about the E11 is that you can &#34;band&#34; it to an iPod and use it as a portable setup.  The buttons on the E11 are on the side, so you can have the ipod on top of the E11 and go.  The E17 has the buttons on the front, so if you want to use it for an iPod amp, you have to mount them back-to-back, and the iPOd has to be down if it's flat, so you don't turn the power off on the E17.  Maybe just a personal preference, but it really isn't designed for a portable configuration like the E11, or most other portable amps are (several other models designed for the ipod have controls on side/top).
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|This was a fast paced well acted movie!!! This movie was so very much better than the first Total Recall
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|This was just bad. The threadbare thin plot gets worse and worse as the movie progresses and the killings continue incessantly and gratuitous violence is at its low. I was looking forward to one of Gordon-Levitt's new roles but he should have stayed in Third Rock from the Sun. His acting is poor in this movie. Avoid this one.
B00AMBM9MO|1.0|This was a waste of a $2.99 rental.  Third grade humor.  We wanted a funny movie but this was just silly stupid.
B00AE6SS5O|5.0|The first few levels were deceptively easy..but as the story goes, I found myself running out of time on the clock. I've not finished the game but I am enjoying it so far. Have fun!
B000HC2LI0|5.0|This holiday MADE my husband's Christmas. We laugh and cry all over again. Fine writing, fine acting,... Production quality of recording is very good. Great extras. Like being able to choose episodes. Gift quality packaging. Had scratches on a couple of disks. Amazon mailed out a clean collection right away, even before we returned the original. Received in a day! Great product, great service, good value. Very satisfied.
B008K8X0IS|3.0|This is basically the first-season set in a fancy box with a 4&#34; plastic dragon-egg paperweight for $100 list price.<br /><br />The only other bonus is a DVD with the first episode of Season 2.  That doesn't even make any sense.  What is the point in that?<br /><br />I think the correct price point for this set would be about $60.  This sad &#34;collectors edition&#34; is just another attempt by the studios to make money off the fans.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|My son had been asking for this since he saw it a year or two ago. He wanted to save up for it but at the price realised he wouldn't be able to get it some time soon. We kept saying it was more than we were prepared to pay for for lego and then finally got it for him as a surprise. He loved it and just kept working at it until he got it all put together. He is only 8 but apart from my finding some 10 pieces for him over the 2 days it took him to make it he did it all himself. Where to put it is the next problem!
B005K17RU0|5.0|As a frequent traveler around the Rocky Moutain area I use every site I can and AccuWeather is my usual choice.<br />Just right and well presented.
B005P3NPXG|5.0|I love Seal's original music from year's ago but how he interpret's these older hits is just wonderful.  What a voice.  See him in concert if you can.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|i think its a great app, i use it for my recipes at work and at home.  i also use it for researching hobbys and vacations.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|As I have prgressed through my life I have become more introspective and contemplative of &#34;what it all means.&#34; This story of one man's journey provides some clue that there is more going on than I am aware of, and it hardly matters whether it is &#34;real&#34; or something the brain is capable of. Although I have been and continue to be atheist, the story and the mentioning of god does not necessarily clash with my belief that we inhabit a holographic universe that is far deeper, larger, closer, and more inspiring than we are normally aware. There is no way to determine at this point in time if what Eben experienced can be examined in a scientific way. IT has been my experience that people do not tend to lie about the enlightening experiences they have.
B009E3EY38|5.0|About time they put this on disk and packaged it up.  In my opinion, the Deluxe Edition is worth the extra couple of bucks to get the bonus DVD.<br /><br />The sound quality on the CD's is excellent, they really mixed this well for a live set, I'm guessing it's all digital-direct from the mixers.<br /><br />The video/audio on the blu-ray disks is also top notch.  Great package overall.  Well worth the price for the die-hard Zeppelin fan.
B003XRELGQ|4.0|I think it's been 30 years since I first read this book and for some reason was craving Vonnegut.  It's time to start loading up, how I missed his clever and witty writing.  Keenly insightful by using outlandish and bizarre scenarios.  I can't wait to get another!
B001BR5NN0|5.0|One of the classics.  I think every teenager/college student should see this at some point in their life.  I don't think the clique's have changed in 20 years.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|Time after time trip advisor has recommend great restaurants in places I was unfamiliar with.  A great app for anyone on the go.
B009FB3XTA|2.0|I really am disappointed on this CD.  I really enjoyed all of the other TS CD's but this one is so slow, and not upbeat like the others.  It's all ballads.  I was hoping for some Muse, which there is none, and some really good songs, but this one only has 1 or 2.
030758836X|5.0|The marital psychodrama thriller is not a new genre but has received a terrific, modern shot in the arm with Gone Girl.  The plot is twisty and fun, leading to the can't-put-it-down factor.  What I loved even more was the insight into the difficult terrain of male-female attraction and relationships in general.  The theory: Every man longs to find and marry a \\"cool girl.\\"  Cool girls are not only beautiful size 2's but love cars, sports, and hunting.  They are endlessly patient, undemanding, forgiving, and ready for adventurous sex at all times.  \\"Cool girls,\\" by that definition, do not exist, but many an American woman pretends to be one long enough to snare the right husband.  This may sound anachronistic, but its ring of truth resonates, despite the unreliability of the character who delivers the message.<br /><br />So does this mean Gone Girl is a book that only chicks will like?  No; all the relationship stuff is delivered with loads of wit, and the author doesn't take sides.<br /><br />What does all this social psychology have to do with a murder mystery?  Read Gone Girl and find out.  You'll have a great time.
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|The game was intriguing and fun. I love time travel and puzzle games. I recommend this game for any puzzle lovers. Tesla is a unknown figure in the expansion of electrcity
0525953728|5.0|I recommend this book to anyone. I'm a big reader on military/battlefield books and this one is right up there at the top.
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|This movie is surprising in a lot of ways, mostly because it turns into something that you don't expect at all.  (The structure of it reminded me of Psycho in how it completely shifts gears mid-way through.)  Try to go in knowing as little as possible.  The story goes places that are disturbing, intriguing and emotional.  The performances are all strong, (Jeff Daniels is great as a tired mobster) and there is some of the best directing of a child actor I've seen in recent memory.  The film is quite violent, but it never feels exploitative.  They pick their moments here, which makes the screen violence meaningful and at times, terrifying.  Even if you start picking apart the time travel paradoxes, the movie stays true to its own logic.  There is plenty of great craft and art here to appreciate, check it out!
B004F1F32A|4.0|streaming was slow, and it had to restart twice.  When it was streaming it was a great quality picture, thanks.
B00APUQRPC|3.0|Why must this movie be needlessly trailer-trashed with the constant use of GD throughout? This kind of profanity doesn't add anything whatsoever to this movie - in fact, it subtracts from it. If you can stomach listening to this garbage, the movie itself is pretty good.
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|My husband was a huge fan of the original Tron movie, so there was no question that he wanted the new movie on dvd after we saw it on the big screen.
B004J64QSI|5.0|THE MUSIC ADAPTATION IS GREAT AND THE END IS FANTASTIC TO SEE THE ORIGINAL CAST AND THE FOUR MEN THAT PLAYED THE LEAD.  THE FUTURE STARS WAS ALSO VERY EMOTIONAL.  WELL WORTH THE PRICE.
B008FPOIT6|2.0|I felt like I was reading an IT game. The book tries too hard to make the characters super smart - making the reader feel somewhat dumb.
0375851569|5.0|Dr. Seuss is a key ingredient in any child's story collection, and this starter kit is the core group of Dr. Seuss books that EVERY child should experience!
B008P1EWIM|4.0|Could use more locations in a number of states, otherwise a good app, would also like to see additional instruments and customized layout.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This is a nice little game to while away some hours on your Kindle Fire.  Good quality graphics, easy to view, easy to play.
B004KPLVW2|5.0|We had been looking for this movie for a long time as my husband loves the movie. Finding it in blu-ray/ dvd was a bonus as we can watch it in all its blu-ray glory or curl up in bed and fall asleep to the dvd.
B007Y57OD0|5.0|The Banks of Eden has been fairly uniformly praised and rightly so. It is the Flower Kings' most consistent album from start to finish in a long time. Even the bonus CD, though less proggy than the main disc, is quite enjoyable.<br />What does the listener get? LOTS of tasty prog including a 25 minute opus to get things rolling. First-rate musicians, first-rate songwriting, you just couldn't ask for more. Though I like the entire album, my favorites are that epic Numbers, For Those About to Drown, Rising the Imperial, Fireghosts, and the beautiful instrumental Illuminati.<br />The CDs are housed in a six-panel gatefold digipak and are accompanied by an attractive booklet containing artwork, pictures, pertinent album info, and the lyrics. Banks of Eden is a winner, make sure you own the special edition.<br />Note: The order of the tracks on the bonus disc as listed on amazon is not their actual order.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I don't mind the loss of the original soundtrack especially since the whole collection only cost me 25 bucks! Can't get better than Daria.
1451695195|1.0|This book should not be called Proof of Heaven.  It is very misleading.  People think they will hear of God and Heaven.  Instead they will hear of Om, wallowing in mud and psychic connections.  Honestly, I was extraordinarily disappointed at the way people were tricked into buying this book.  Also, you will need a dictionary to even get through it.
1449410243|1.0|I got this book for Christmas from my mother, but I don't have the heart to tell her that the $9 she plunked down was a monumental waste of hard to come by cash.  I'd give it no stars, if that was an option.  The illustrations are lame, the \\"jokes\\" even more lame.  It's not funny, clever, witty or intelligent by any stretch of the imagination.  It's a sophomoric waste of paper.  I wonder how many trees had to die in the printing of this trail of cat vomit.
B005HSL626|5.0|For such a simple game, there is definitely a trick to it!  I like the fact that each games lasts just a few minutes, making it easy to fill those odd minutes spent waiting, etc.<br /><br />Fun game!
B00005A3KS|5.0|Watched this movie so many times when I was little.  I love it and my review might be biased. However I think this is a great film and one of Kathrine Biglows best.  Keanu Reeves and Gary Busy are hysterical. Pretty much every line can quoted.  Its just epic.
0425264351|3.0|The plot of this book pivots on coincidences that would make Dickens blush.  It also has a lot of violence but, interestingly, no cursing that I can recall-certainly no f-words, which, in a book like this, you would expect in abundance.  (By the way, we know that \\"E Pluribus Unum\\" means \\"From Many, One\\" but \\"E Unum Pluribus\\" means exactly the same thing, not \\"From One, Many\\".  Changing the order of words in Latin does not change the meaning of a sentence since it's an inflected language; that is, a word's meaning in a sentence is derived from its suffix, not from its order in the sentence as is the case in English.)<br /><br />Having said that, I will admit having fun reading the book and I will start reading the second in the series today.  For some reason, I kept thinking of Doc Savage, which I read as a kid, while reading \\"The Killing Floor\\".  I only hope Mr. Child gets more realistic and does a little more research in future episodes.
B002FHJ4B2|4.0|This is a classic from my childhood. Great cast and a good story. HD and sound has good quality for being an older movie.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I am in my mid 40's and I stay fairly active whether it is doing Zumba and/or biking.  Now that it's too cold to go outdoors, and I'm not enjoying the indoor bike too much anymore, I bought this tape after reading the reviews. It is kicking my butt! I have bought others before but never stuck to them for long, this one I know I will. I guess for the others that say it's pretty easy....I'm thinking they have to be in really great shape.  I love that it's quick, effective, how she talks thru the workout by giving you tips on proper form, and that there are 2 advance workouts included.  Like a previous reviewer stated, the first few minutes of the tape are a bit annoying.  I want to just get started and not listen, but I guess it's a way to promote other things.  I'm not marking off for that because of how much I am pleased by this tape.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I rate it 27374473728193834 out of 5(; I'm a Pinterest addict&lt;3 Its absolutely amazing. I love that you can have as many boards as you want. It's just amazing&lt;3
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|Loved the movie was unsure but was very surprised in the direction the movie took not at all what i expected
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|This  was one of my favorite books by him. He's such a great writer! He knows how to keep you interested ans not want to put the book down
1594744769|5.0|I read this on my Kindle and do feel that I lost a little of the pleasure as the photos were not as clear as they would have been in print. I liked the book and the story and look forward to the sequel. I suggest this as a book for 13+ and feel that the story and situations are easily relatable and the horror is tempered by the actions of the hero of the book.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|Dinner Dash is a great game that I love playing on my Kindle Fire. It runs smoothly and quickly. I would reccomend this game to anyone that loves time management games.
B007ZD17XO|4.0|Fun game that definately gets more challenging as you progress through the levels - originally got the free version but quickly got addicted so had to buy the full version so I could continue to progress through the upper levels.
B001JNNDEW|5.0|This is a often over looked comedy, it definitely has more of a cult following much like chasing amy, or clerks, just an all around great movie, I highly recommend
B0034G4P94|5.0|Great movie! Has a little bit 4 everyone in the family. Lots of action. Fight scenes very realistic. Was recomended to me by a friend.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|From a non dog lover.....I was pleasantly surprised on how much I enjoyed this story. It was sad, happy, heart warming. All the elements one can expect from a really good story.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|I enjoyed the first movie, the second one wasn't quite as good except for the dog and the third one is a nice bookend to the series.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use! Big buttons and numbers. Love different options, use it for every day financing. Great app to have!
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Characterization wasn't up to his usual standard in that the 'feel' was formula like especially in the begining. I still like John corey a lot. Past that, the whole Islamic terrorist thing also felt like a formula. &#60;shrug&#62; Good book, but not as good as the early efforts in this series.
B0015DRPJU|5.0|I liked this book because it is something new to me. New types of vampires, there are two different kinds, the living Moroi and the dead Strogoi. And then there is the seriously hardcore race, the dhampires!<br />Another thing I liked about this book is that friendship rates very high, it is not the usual where the main character falls deeply in love with this super hot dude and forgetts everything around her. I like the way Rose does everything in her power to take care of everyone she loves even at the cost of her own happiness and her sanity. This book have really great scenes and some really heartbreaking! The thing is, don't give up, keep reading! It gets better!<br />And of course, the most important thing with every book is that the author writes in a exiting sort of way that makes you forgett what time it is and when you have finished the book you realise that you've been awake for like 24 hours or more. I have to say that I haven't been sleeping very well lately because I haven't been able to put down this book!<br /><br />(Since I have been writing this on my iPad and English isn't my mother tongue there can be misspellings and so on...)
B0021L8UQ2|4.0|It's a good suspense movie I saw after a long time and enjoyed watching it. The only thing is once you know what's the end of these movies don't feel like watching them again untill next couple years maybe. but it is good to watch it once for sure.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I llove dragonvale the app is amazingly fun and addictive. I think that this is my fqvorite app of all time.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Bought this for grandson's 18th birthday. He said it's the best he has ever used! Very happy! Shipped super fast!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love this game! It makes you think and think real quick. i love it and have it on both my kids kindles.
1451695195|1.0|This book is not only a total wasted of time, it is one GENIUS, let me repeat, GENIUS, doctor's ploy to get money. By trying to get into your \\"soul\\", he makes the reader feel all happy inside. Or so he's supposed to. Instead, this is a plain waste of money, time, brain activity. Its a wonder how someone smart enough to be a neurosurgeon ended up so Ignorant.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book because it shows both the barbarism and the humanity in people. What we are capable of when pushed into a life and death situation.  I recommend this book to people of all ages.
B000GOU4M4|5.0|Have watched Christmas Vacation since 1985?, it is not Christmas without it. Chevy Chase and the cast are the best.  Great laughs each year.  It never, never, never gets old. My family sets a date each year and we watch it together even though we are miles apart, and of course after the movie talk about it via the computer and smart phones.  How many movies can bring a family together like that.  LOVE IT!
B002VPE1WK|3.0|This bag held our camera equipment very nicely.  We were a little concerned about the lack of padding on the bottom of the bag and the inability to lock the zippers together (making it more secure) when travelling.  We spent a lot of time organizing our camera equipment in the bag  without trying it on first.  BIG mistake.  My husband is 6 feet tall and thin, but I couldn't help giggling at him in this backpack.  It looked like a child's backpack on him.  It sat extremely high on his back and there was a ton of space between the bottom of the bag and the bottom of his back.  On the other hand, I'm 5'2 and it was ok on me.  We returned it and now we're on the hunt for a new bag.
B00APUYWYA|2.0|Maybe I am just a prude but way to much sexual content and language for a PG movie in my mind.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|I enjoyed this book: Preston and Child work better together than individually it seems.  This one is a bit predictable at the end, but that's okay, as I enjoy the characters they create and the situations the authors put them in.  This one continues the struggles of Pendergast and co against the Nazi workings.  Good stuff.  Not great, but good.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|Tom Cruise is starting to look his age but this movie was as good or better than the first three.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|This movie isn't going to win &#34;Best Picture of the Year&#34; and I doubt any of the actors or actresses will win an Oscar, but it was a very entertaining movie.  I would watch it again.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book kept me guessing throughout. I loved trying to figure it out. The ending was not what I expected, but that was OK too. A total surprise. As long as the characters stay in character and don't pull a 180 degree turn and become a total new version of themselves. Unless that IS part of their character! If you like a good gut-wrenching, hair-pulling who-done-it, This is your book!
B007SGM084|5.0|Have read the trilogy twice already.  Great to have in Kindle format.  Easier to travel with then the individual books
B004U52VPS|5.0|I thought it was a simple game, but the boys really loved it.<br />I bought this item for two different boys, one 5 and one was 9. Both of them opened it right away and started building the stacks and knowcing them down. It was great. I was super happy with this purchase. When I was with the older boy and we were cleaning up, there isn't really anything to put back into the box, so we grabbed a quart size storage bag and viola, fits in one bag. :)
0525950079|5.0|I bought this for my grandpa for Christmas this year 2012 -- he is really lovin it -- great story :)
0375413405|5.0|I bought this for my wife as a birthday present and she absolutely loves it. She cooks something out of it at least once a week and loves how simple most of the recipes are. Of course, she was already a Julia Child fan.

B00AMBH70S|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  I served in the military and a number of Jeremy Renner's films speak loudly to me
0545265355|5.0|I bought this for my grandpa for Christmas this year 2012 -- he is really lovin it -- great story :)
B005VTS4EY|4.0|Good game, fun concept, graphics could be updated maybe, and a restart button would be helpfull instead of hitting pause first
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|Each year when American Idol starts, I listen to each performer and ask myself, \\"Would I pay money for it?  Would I play it in my car?\\"  Generally, by episode 5 or 6, I realize the answer is \\"no\\" to both questions. I lose interest in the show.  Last year, however, Phillip Phillips captivated me from the first performance and held my attention until the finale.  I couldn't wait for his album to be released. I paid money for it.  I listen to it in my car.  Over and over. I sing along.  I recommend you do the same.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I can't believe I found this set for under $30.  The asking price for Batman rises was $25 so it made complete sense to get the trilogy.
B004M8S6FC|5.0|To create his setting Scalzi created an interesting and unique universe populated by diverse cultures.  The main character was given a very clear and understandable motivation for his actions, and the name is in my opinion, brilliant.  I enjoyed the questions that he had from the beginning and the very startling set of answers.  The military training, weaponry and modifications were fascinating to say the least.<br /><br />This was the first Scalzi novel that I ever read, and it has converted me into a true Scalzi fan.  If you enjoyed Starship Troopers, you'll probably enjoy this, and if you're just a fan of military sic-fi, then you should enjoy this.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this.  I am 12 years old and my mom let me order this.  I recommend it to everyone.  Love it!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I wasn't expecting the interesting and surprising twists in this book! The battles this man fought in war and at home in Arkansas are presented with honesty and respect for the reader. I appreciated Eric Blehm's truthful approach in telling the story of an outstanding man who fought back against some very difficult personal weaknesses.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I have to say, I don't read a great deal of biographies but Isaacson does an amazing job writing about the life of Steve Jobs. It's an excellent blend of the technological feats of Apple and Jobs' personal life. I truly enjoyed it. The interviews with those who worked with Jobs truly balances the portrayal of Jobs as a furious genius who sought perfection and paints him as incredibly human.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I have seen Many Musicals before and this put the icing on the cake the vocal are amazing and so much passion in there voices despite the one bad review this movie is great the picked a good set of actors to portray the parts<br /><br />Please see it for yourself you will enjoy it
B008F5YDRI|5.0|I like Salmon Fishing in the Yemen it is very good story<br />I like Salmon Fishing in the Yemen it is very good story
B004N622EY|5.0|This is the novel that I used to convince my girlfriend that the genre of fantasy might actually be of merit after all.  The protagonist is a multi-layered and interesting creature named Vin.  Reading the novel you get to watch her grow in ways that are decidedly unexpected from her introduction.  The other characters were also interesting and varied, with a plot that quickly had me hooked.  Mistborn also has a fun and unique system for magic.  Many fantasy novels have poorly defined or unoriginal forms of magic, not so here, Allomancy is well defined and interesting, forcing Sanderson to create a plot that is both interesting and internally self-consistent without the potential of rescue by some form of deus ex machina.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this novel strongly enough.
141659521X|5.0|Excellent read once again. Vince has you guessing as the plot twists & turns. Mitch is his usual badxxx self. Irene is more involved than in other books. Does Mitch have a new love? ( and it's not Irene )<br />Tough to put this book down!
B005LAIGLO|3.0|What can you say about a Mark Wahlberg movie? Exciting, full of action? Well it's not here. To me it's rather slow paced and uneventful. The ending was better then the whole of the movie. It looked better in the previews. If you want a good movie from Mark try 3 kings, or Four Brothers, both are exceptional. As for this one, if its really cheap, then get it or rent it first.
B007THA4FI|2.0|i've been having a hard time getting into this book.  I've started reading it twice now and just doesnt keep my attention.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|I am a big fan of these movies, so when i saw it was coming out for such a low price on amazon i had to buy it. Speedy delivery, and a great price.
B00005JL0I|5.0|As a collector of the James Bond movie, this was a great spoof on the James Bond character. It was a good laugh
B0064W652A|5.0|I couldn't put this down! I'd even chosen to read this while the rest of my family watched The Dark Knight Rises on my grandma's 70 inch tv. Stupendous plotline!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I play the game all the time and love it, I just have a hard time winning all the time.
B0073U2FB2|4.0|The aliens attack, this time in Moscow. Still in the mix are Americans and Brits. Why they didn't stay home is beyond me. The odd thing is the obnoxious friend of the geek trying to sell a on-line company is the one that survives, while the intelligent friend is flashed, that's killed by some kind of electric charge. Different but totally expected. From other reviews I almost didn't by it but at the lowest price I have seen in months I tried it. Short movie but exciting nonetheless. I recommend it to sci-fi fans.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Was so sad when i reached the end of the book.... So waiting for the movie to come out or more books, continuing the story.
B0058YPGL6|5.0|I didn't discover this show until about 4 months ago when I was perusing my streaming NetFlix account and this show popped up as a suggestion since I'm a big fan of the CW show &#34;Supernatural&#34;.  I decided to give the pilot a try, and before I knew it, I'd streamed the whole first season all morning, afternoon and late into the night.  I was hooked!  I was dubious about it at first since the title and vague premise seemed so juvenile and Twilight-esque, but I found the writing to be top-notch, surprising for a teen-centric show on MTV.  I researched the crew and found that Jeff Davis also created Criminal Minds, which I find fascinating and haunting.  That really motivated me to keep watching - and the writing got even better into season 2.<br /><br />Amazon offers this at a great price and the extras (especially the commentaries by the cast and gag reel) are hilarious.  The commentaries with Jeff Davis and director Russell Mulcahy were very informative; I'm always annoyed by commentaries that reveal so little about the show, the writing process, behind-the-scenes stories, etc., but this DVD didn't disappoint.  You can tell how much fun everyone has on this show.  I'll definitely be buying season 2 on DVD when it finally comes out and anxiously awaiting season 3!
B008QTV3X0|4.0|Mandy carries this show. Well paced and involving. Clever and basically appealing. Danes good but a little overwrought. If you liked 24 this is much slower but still satisfying.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I just wish that you made either Celestia or Cadance cost only 100,000 bits or something... And prices for gems are ridiculous! But other than that its a lovable game...
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|This movie kept me entertained and was not what I quite expected when I rented it.  I liked the acting in this movie & all the twists.  I have recommended this movie to my friends and family to watch.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Loved this book, it was one of the first I read on my Kindle. Very moving and overall an amazing read.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I could hardly wait to read the third.... I love the story, the romance, the love.  It's so much more then what people THINK IT'S ABOUT.
B004SIP8JI|4.0|Hugh's performance was great, he was so believable playing a man out of time.  Meg Ryan, unfortunately, plays Kate is if she herself is annoyed she plays the same character time and time again.  Kate is pessimistic and boring, but Leopold more than makes up for her drabness.  Overall, a cute love story with the time-travelling aspect making it unique.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple run is a really fun game for children and adults<br />You can buy stuff with the coins you get and the best part about temple run is it never ends you can run as far as you want! You can even get into the millions for your score. So I think everyone should get this app!<br />So go ahead and buy it people!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005M92MJ6|5.0|I've liked alot of MJK's work. This one is so unlike the other Puscifer albums, but it's great. Usually when a band(or front man) tries something new, it's garbage. Depending on my mood I can either get lost in the music or rock out to it. For anyone who likes MJK or his bands, this is something new to enjoy.<br /><br />And the cover? haha...what is this about?
B00APUQRPC|5.0|I loved this movie! Excellent acting especially by Eastwood.  I love a movie with a moving storyline and good morals to the story.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This was a well written and fascinating book. It simply told the life story of Adam Brown - Navy SEAL Team SIX Operator. His story was particularly special because of the hurdles Adam faced in his life. From a teenager all the way through the end. Adam faced each and every obstacle with such bravery. He always aspired to be the best and not be limited by anything. It shares the story of a man who loved God, his country, his family, and his friends and fellow SEALS.<br /><br />You think you know what happens at the end because the book starts with an introduction about how and why this book was written about the life of Adam. However, you are surprised at the end...a very painful surprise. When I finished the book at 4 a.m. I had an emotional moment as I grasped what happened. It was really hard to believe and brought me to tears.<br /><br />I am forever indebted to all the great men and women who serve our country in the armed forces. God bless them all.
B009LRE040|5.0|i thought it was wonderful and can hardly wait for more.  Awesome movie . Worth seeing it.  I love it
B008FPOIT6|2.0|A young man, having recently lost his job designing a bagel web site, finds himself unemployed in San Francisco. Ultimately, he takes a job as the late shift clerk of Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore, but one assumes that his parents are covering his rent. While at the book store, he stumbles onto a centuries-old conspiracy, which he unravels with the help of smarter and better-connected friends.<br /><br />I picked up Penumbra because of numerous mentions in best of the year lists, but to my disappointment, I found it to be far from what was advertised. In many ways, it reminds me of a juvenile version of a Thomas Pynchon novel -- quirky characters, numerous pop culture references, a vast and mysterious conspiracy. However, to go for that kind of surreal commentary on contemporary culture, you need to have the literary skills to make up for paper-thin characters, and your references have to be deeper and more obscure than Google and Industrial Light and Magic.<br /><br />There's attempted cleverness on the part of the author -- demonstrating a Kindle, attending a party via Skype, the politics of the Google cafeteria -- but in the fast-forward state of contemporary culture, these references seem stale.<br /><br />As someone who has worked for many years in web design, I found myself rolling my eyes not just at the tech references, but at the author's unrestrained awe for Google's employees and his genius ILM-employed roommate.  This book's short shelf-life ended back in 2010 (and possibly even during the dot-com bust). Perhaps someone in their early 20's will appreciate it, or some teenager out in rural America dreaming of one day moving to San Francisco, but I can't think of a wider audience.
B007SGM084|3.0|I found the first book to be almost sophmoric in style.  The author overused the word &#34;hot&#34; about as much as a teenager uses the word &#34;like&#34; inappropriately.  By the time I got to the third, I thought, &#34;Oh!  There was a story here after all!&#34;
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Remember high school? Weather it was you that blended into the wall, or someone else, we all knew a wallflower. This book makes you think. Makes you question the main character's sense of reality right til the end. I found myself laughing, and sometimes I felt a pit in my stomach. Definitely worth the read. Just a though, while reading, really take time to remember things taking place, it will make it easier at the end of the book.
B004UID2LC|3.0|This app is okay but it takes forever to load and from what I see you can't have favourites...... someone help me!
B0042816YK|5.0|This movie was heart touching, I generally give any movie with Julia Roberts in it a try, but I have to say I really loved this movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I could not put this book down! So excited to read the next book. I can only imagine what lies ahead
B00915G6WQ|5.0|I started watching these seasons when season three started.  I must say this is the best series I haver ever encountered.  This is not something for the weak or for those morally blinded by the black and white between right and wrong or good and evil.  This series goes into the areas of grey of a persons soul and moral codes.  I love the charectoe of Dexter and Michael Hall is amazing. I can't imagine anyone playing this role more efficiently.  the supporting actors are also the best of best.  Im not sure what I will watch with so much enthusiasm nothing compares.  I cant bare the dissappointment when this ends,
B008MG1E4A|5.0|was very interesting and informative.. shared with my friends and family<br />thought there would be more information on the event
B00AGE20ZI|5.0|This movie has always been one of my favorites. Cary Grant and David Niven were so well cast! A must see if you like older movies.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Educated and entertained at the same time as always. Ken Follett never disappoints in all of his books. Looking forward to the next one.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|A must read especially for anyone who loves a good romantic Novel! You won't be able to put it down once you start!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Think you know what is going on? Here is the truth from Navy SEAL Chris Kyle. Written with a refreshing honestly, Kyle tells his story in a series of short stories about his own experiences. An excellent and thought provoking read.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|I have been having a great time playing with this ap. I love being able to draw on my photos on my Kindle.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put the book down! It was the perfect combination of love, sadness, adventure, happiness and so many more emotions. Buying the next book now!
B005V2S7FW|2.0|too hard to get into and set up.  sounded like a good idea when it was featured in a tech column in our local paper. maybe I am just computer illiterate tho???
1451695195|5.0|An inspiring story that offers spiritual hope.  If I thought all there was to life was one is born, lives, then dies and that's the end of us, that thought would be very depressing and I'd wonder what it was all for.  Reports like this are very helpful spiritually.
B000N6U0E2|4.0|An endearing movie for every father who has a child and no family to turn to for help .  I thought Will Smith and Son did an excellent job.
B003V1WXKU|5.0|An amazing gift for anyone in physics but a great read for the layman as well. Feynman is so smart and tells his story in a clever tongue in cheek way that will keep you turning the page late into the night. Couldn't put it down!
0783225733|5.0|Great DVD,  I've seen is six times and I like to see again. Very exciting and historic!<br />I would recommend this DVD to all my friends.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|this game was really quite fun. kept my kids and I busy. keep up the good work. made for a good cuddle evening.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I've eyed this one for quite awhile. I caught the Kindle version on sale for $1.99. It was well worth three or four times that. The storyline is very unique. I loved the characters, although there's not a lot of backstory for most of them, which is fine. It would probably detract from the overall story.<br /><br />I understand the comments regarding the Kindle version not being very good due to the use of photographs and handwritten letters. However, I didn't have a problem with this. I will say that I use the Kindle app on iPad, so I'm not sure of that changes the quality of the images.<br /><br />I really hope there will be more in this series as we follow the young peculiars on their travels,
B0080K3G4O|4.0|This book provides a nice summary of different philosophies related to happiness. The research that author did for this boom is rather thorough.
0385535147|2.0|Another dud from my favorite author.  Is he getting tired of writing? This book is boring - had to force myself to keep reading it.  Kept hoping for some redeeming feature.  None appeared.
B005LAIHZE|5.0|It is a really good movie, it's kind of boring in the beginning, but from the middle to the end it is the beast movie yet
B0063IH60K|5.0|GREAT APP,  WORKS PERFECTLY! VERY GOOD CURE FOR BOREDOM ;) I LOVE THAT IT SAVES YOUR GAME WHEN YOU CLOSE OUT!
B008QPCCQQ|5.0|I have always been a big fan of the Louisa May Alcott's books and you will not be disappointed. A very good gift set to give to a young girl.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|Three stars for effort.  Had it not been a remake, it may have registered as being \\"good\\".  Nothing here improved upon the creative, fun, action packed, original storyline of the first release.  I wasn't bored, but the first was much better.
B000JO9JHW|5.0|The best show I have ever seen. I finally have faith in tv shows again. I cannot wait until I get the second season.
030758836X|5.0|What a thriller!  Whatever you do, don't start this book on a weeknight if you have to go to work the next day.  Hard to stop reading.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was fantastic. Another of my favorites from 2012. I couldn't put the book down! Such an amazing plot line and conclusion.
B007THA4FI|5.0|If you're looking for fanciful and fun this is not your book.  This is about reality.  The thoughts and feelings that motivate our behaviors.  Are you a good person if you do the right things for the wrong reasons?  Are you a bad person if you have good intentions but your actions cause harm?  And it also takes a good look at society's treatment of our most vuneralble members.  A true look at how the lack of knowledge of choices can affect us and the tragedy that can cause.  How grown people can read this book and not feel for the Krystal Weedon's of the world is beyond me.  I can only assume that they are ignorant of other people's reality and arrogant in their belief that they could do better if placed in the same situation.  It's easy, but ignorant and arrogant, to look down at people who have not been given all the knowledge and chances in life that we have had and believe that we could do better.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|very fun of a game happy days lol haha little slow though ugh but i loved it not so shabby
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I love this book and the reporting style used by the author.  It is a great read and I have recommended it to my friends.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|Bad ass, one hell of a feel good movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it for the cinematography and for the musical scores associated with it.
B002VPE1XE|5.0|excellent, it is very important to me. I liked the product, it's just as I wanted. and of excellent quality, and precise specifications thanks.
B009NPK1IO|5.0|I like the idea of being able to order and watch right away. When I purchased the sixth season it wasn't showing up in my video library, but the purchase had already been debited from my account. I went to the customer service portal where I was able to chat online with Zack from Amazon. He worked his magic and within in 3 minutes I was able to watch. Great quality and great service.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|I expected something different, It made me laugh immediately. Not sure I will finish the game but it is fun!
0307346617|4.0|This book was a real page turner. It was set up like a series of interviews of various survivors. I both loved and hated this format. I loved hearing all the different points of view on the same situation and the fact that if you weren't really connecting with one of the stories it was ok because it was only one chapter out of the book. However, I often found myself really enjoying a chapter and being disappointed when it ended, wanting to read more of that person's story. Overall though I truly loved it and would totally recommend it. (Fair warning though, if you don't like reading books that swear a lot this might not be for you)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|At first I wasn't sure about buying this book because of the age of the characters... This is NOT for the weak at heart...This story will tear your heart out and give you a real dose of life and sadness. The author did an impressive job with the writing and character development. Plan to stay up all night if you start reading late... worth the lack of sleep when you get to the end. Holder is my new hero.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Not bad for batman, volume has to be adjusted because they mumble the entire time of the movie but it works
B009HEJXFS|3.0|Definitely better than the second movie, but not as good as the first.  Quality was OK streaming, no interruptions at all.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|I've been using this program for over a year and it is flawless!  The app itself is beautiful. The widgets are as equally,  beautiful. Above all the forecast is spotless and accurate . Every programmatic tweak you could ponder they have done; EVERYTHING is customizable. This is your 1 stop shop for weather from now on. I'm incredibly happy with this application.
B0000549B0|5.0|I love this movie.  When I saw it was on DVD I had to buy it.  The price was reasonable and I received it quickly.
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|some of the songs were a little to long, i.e. &#34;At the end of the day&#34;, they didn't need to include some of the end. and there was no need for he last battle. the other songs were good though.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|I am not able to listen to my fav local, New Orleans, radio of blues, jazz, cajun, R&B...everything this great city has created.<br />A great station wwoz.org, variety of programming. The app worked great for this. Just starting to use so no more to say.
B006L3RZ26|5.0|Very good, better than I expected. Heard on radio, purchased based on a single piece, well worth the price. Buy it
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was epically amazing. Quite a tear jerker but also makes you reevaluate life and look at it from a different perspective. I fell in love with it, its characters, and its story. This story takes life to a whole new level.
0767847431|5.0|Love seeing it once a year.  Beautiful color, great costumes, great sets, great cast and one of Ray Harryhousen best!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Ok, the first story is crazy short, you're tempted then immediately dropped into a second story that plods on for far too long. However, once you get about 75% of the way through story two, you're onto a fantastic tale that you can't put down and will keep you up long past the time you should have gone to sleep
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|Nice enough, storyline was a little week, but the rest of the movie was great. My sister and I watched it.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|In addition to the beautiful background of this app, it has detailed weather and also has the time.  Thanks all who recommended this one.
B003ZDZ1WG|4.0|I am not a country music fan, but really like this CD, Will consider buying more like this in the future
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This was a sad but happy book. I liked the first 2 better. You must read the epilogue when your done
B003XDZLXW|5.0|Bought these as a gift for someone who has foot problems & she absolutely loves them. Sizing was exact & they look really cute. Now I'm ordering a pair for myself
B000FC1MCS|4.0|Having some experience with mentally challenged (30 yhears), I found this book to be very realistic. It was like being in the mind of that young man and felt like a completely honest portrayal.  I enjoyed it very much.  Wish it was longer.
B004VYYA2K|5.0|Nice portable Barbie storage and being able to unzip for &#34;rooms&#34; is an added bonus. Has tote handles that make it easy to carry.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Sad, depressing throughout. Really waste of time to read. Story continues with establishing more of an organized rebellion, saving Peeta, & a lot of deaths that follow along the way.
0061998494|5.0|it is amazing what a person goes throught before they stop and say ok dummy wake up and walk straight. if you like craig you must read this book.
B009JBZH54|5.0|the packaging is just awesome, the movies are even awesomer, and the experience is priceless. buy now if you're a fan of comic book movies or movies in general.
1932907009|5.0|THIS BOOK IS VERY INFORMATIVE AND VERY WELL RESEARCHED, AND WELL WRITTEN. I SURELY WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ALL.

B009AOFNU4|2.0|I've spent a good deal of time with the SSF thanks to a friend who owns one. I even went so far as to order one from Amazon despite it being out of stock with no in stock date listed. I actually ended up being grateful for this as it gave me the opportunity to spend some quality time with the controller and it changed my mind.<br /><br />Yes, all the glowing reviews are true. It's a joy to use. It's comfortable, light weight, easy to set up and it really is universal. HOWEVER, the library available for iOS and Android games is pathetic. I highly encourage all potential buyers to visit the SteelSeries website and take a look at the lists yourself. If you find a worthwhile selection of games you think you'd enjoy playing with the SSF, then go for it. If you're like most of the rest of us, there simply aren't enough titles on iOS and Android combined to warrant the price tag for this controller. The list may appear long, but quantity does not make up for the total lack of quality titles.<br /><br />I realize that this controller isn't all about mobile gaming and it does work flawlessly with both of my Windows PCs and my Macbook Pro. And here comes another BUT.. But, I already have several wireless Xbox 360 controllers which with the help of a $15 wireless receiver ALSO work flawlessly with both of my Windows PCs and my Macbook Pro. $80 vs $15? Not a tough choice here. The Xbox 360 controller is easily the current favorite of console gamers and most of us already have at least one of them hanging around. Heck, even if you don't have one, $48 to buy a new one including the receiver is still much more affordable.<br /><br />I really wanted to love the SSF. I really, really did. But until it is more widely supported by mobile game developers, it's just a really expensive portable controller that is unfortunately only a novelty at this point. With Gameloft solely supporting the Duo bluetooth controller, the SSF loses a significant number of the games that I'd even want a controller for in the first place. I'll check back in 6 months or so and see how the library of supported titles grows and if I see even a handful of my favorites there, it would be hard not to buy one. It is also in dire need of a price adjustment. There's no way it can compete when it is nearly twice the price of it's most expensive competitor.ntroller for in the first place.

B001EO748M|4.0|Info not all historically accurate but this series is addictive. however i stopped watching in the third season because the violence & overall meanness got so bad. this series is what got me interested in tudor history & eventually european monarchy history, but i couldn't take anymore. also, after natalie dormer was off (end season 2) it just wasn't as good anymore.
B009329ZF2|5.0|Wanted to watch this movie because of the people playing in it, great cast and plot<br />It was a really good movie
B0012FHGCW|5.0|Based on a true story and can tell. Very real and good acting. Ending is exactly what would happen to me if I had done something courageous/stupid like this.
B004VYYA2K|5.0|This box doubles as barbie storage and I love that the pieces are not getting mixed up with her other toys.  I wish I could have thought of this idea. Much better than a plastic bin.
B005HSL626|5.0|Fun for the whole family. My son loves this app. I have played it and rather enjoyed it myself. I even put it on Zen mode and let my 15 month old play so I could have 5 minutes of peace. I think this is my favorite app so far. Plus, it is FREE!
B007NU54H4|5.0|The Tink series is great.  My daughter loves them and the stories are pretty decent as is the animation.  Hope this series continues.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This is an awesome slightly addictive clas,sic game of one hero standing against all odds and beating up the bad guys. This game is great for solving problems such as boredom aggravation anger and boredom. Or just trying to have fun. So enjoy!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|When i bought this book i didn't think it would be as good as all the reviews were saying but it was AMAZING! I couldn't put it down!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great story, and an easy read. Can't wait to read the rest of the collection. Would recommend it to women who like romance novels, it does get hot and heavy.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book has transformed my overall thoughts throughout each and every page. It has given me a new way to think of things entirely just because of how the main character Charlie thinks. I loved this book and the highlights throughout as well.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|We wanted a few free apps for the car ride on Christmas, and this was the first download. It is one of my son's favorites. He likes this one, but really loves Angry Birds Space Free. I wish we could get the Angry Birds Star Wars for free. I hope it will come out soon.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|This is a great case.  I am a big fan of TPU cases and this case gives me some protection without destroying the basic look of my phone (a big pet peeve of mine!).
B0063IH60K|4.0|I enjoy playing this app.  Every time you start a new game, an ad shows up instead.  I do a search, then arrow back twice<br />and I can play the game.  Its a bit inconvenient but it works for me.
B007EDCWHA|5.0|Amazing book! I thought i knew everything about our boys but I learned so many new things! I recommend this book for any directioner, you will not be disappointed! :)
B0081SRJSY|4.0|The game itself is a solid port. The AIs seem to be more aggressive than the humans I play with about putting tiles in places where no tile will fill the gap, but they're pretty decent. Local multiplayer is a plus.  There are only 4 main complaints.<br /><br />1) Scoring is hard to follow and see. The worst example of this is the farmland.  It's very difficult to see which meeple won the farm land, especially when there are multiple involved in scoring, and the text that shows the point value is sometimes obscured by the white tile borders. For example, let's say I play 2 farmers to the AI's 1. All three farmers are enlarged, and move back to their respective players, and the score comes up. If you don't have a quick eye, it's hard to see where you won or lost<br /><br />2) A color blind mode would be good. Some of the meeples look the same to the color blind.<br /><br />3) network multiplayer would also be a nice feature<br /><br />4) my biggest complaint, however, would be that development seems to have stagnated. There doesn't seem to have been any new features in a long time, i.e., expansions. The iOS version, put out by a completely different company, recently got their first expansion released. Aside from updates for android OS upgrades, no real changes have occurred in the App in quite some time.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was thoroughly blown away at how well thought out this book was. Awesome and kept my attention through its entirety. Thanks again Colleen for another beautifully written story!!!!!
B007N5YIUS|5.0|My son loves it :) He says it is awesome!!! I appreciate all the free apps available for the Kindle.
B00979CS50|5.0|I think this is the best Neil Young/Crazy Horse effort since 1990's \\"Ragged Glory\\". The meandering jams are not overly polished, but have a inspired \\"rough around the edges\\" feel that is the Neil Young-Crazy Horse trademark (Often over polished/over produced albums made by groups like Boston are terrible and rawer, more \\"off the cuff\\" efforts like \\"Exile on Main Street\\" or CCR albums are stellar). Throughout the entire history of the Neil Young and Crazy Horse collaboration there is a catalogue of inspired \\"Garage Band\\" meandering compositions and this is no exception (Cowgirl in the Sand, Down by the River, Cortez the Killer, the entire \\"Tonights the Night\\" album, and Psychedelic Pill effort all mine a similiar vein of \\"sublime coarseness\\"). Personally I think \\"Drifting Back\\", \\"Walk Like a Giant\\", and \\"Twisted Road\\" are all songs that are comparable to the greatest songs in the Neil Young/Crazy Horse canon (they compare to some of my all time favorites such as \\"Cinnamon Girl\\", \\"Like a Hurricane\\", \\"Hey Hey My My\\", \\"Mansion on the Hill\\", \\"Sedan Delivery\\", and so on).
0316069434|1.0|I have enjoyed Michael Connelly books in the past, but this one was awful. Almost like he was just trying to churn out another one, without really thinking through the story. Too many \\"coincidences\\", totally unbelievable in every way.
B003DT19F0|5.0|Bought this for my 5 and 2 year old girls and they love it.  Watch it over and over again during the Christmas holiday.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|We take our 5 year daughter to the movies often and this was the only movie that she sat still and actually watched the whole movie. Usually she fidgets, needs to go to the bathroom several times and talks through the whole movie. We had to keep checking that she was still next to us she was so quiet. She was just mesmerized and when we left she told us we needed to buy this movie when it came out. Wow!!! Great movie
B005LAIISA|4.0|This was on one of my grandson's Christmas list and he was thrilled to receive it - unfortunately our DVD player was not hooked up so he had to wait until he got home to view it.
B00127RAJY|2.0|Difficult but I'm sure you would see results if you did this every day.  I get frustrated with the constant up and down from laying on the ground to standing, that is my biggest complaint with this workout.  Lots of jumping jacks in this one too.
0517255464|5.0|This is a classic. Even though the drawing style is classic as Michelangelo, people wanting to learn 3D primitives for computer imaging can dig in here. Though Bridgman died in 1943 his constructive course in seeing 3D and drawing in 3D have not been beaten.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|With WiFi available in most churches now.. This is by far, the easiest bible to use.. always at your fingertips.
B004SGWYW4|4.0|It covers quick recovery of kids with common sense and how they survive after the pandemic zombie outbreak.  Can't wait for more.  Met one of the parents, but they still need to find the others and continue to survive.  Definitely thought the nurse was a gonner, but the addition to the little girl and dog is interesting.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love watching The Walking Dead and just when it gets so good it goes off for a while for mid season. I love love love it!
1419705849|4.0|Grandson number one has read the whole series and couldn't wait to get this edition - he started reading it the minute the present was opened.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I'm a fan Michael Connelly's writing.  The Black Box did not disappoint me, Harry Bosch is always interesting and a good read.
B000FC1MM8|5.0|Another great book on Harry Bosch and the search for his mother's killer 35 years before. One of his earlier books from the mid-90's, Michael Connelly never makes it seem dated when read today.<br />Fascinating details about the real-world of police forces and detectives along with the most unexpected twists make this a must-read cop thriller.
B00AE2IJIE|2.0|This animated feature isn't sure who the audience is, if you ask me.  I'm assuming it's one of those that are supposed to appeal to both adults and children, but it doesn't live up to &#34;Shrek&#34; standards.  For me, it was a bit tedious, although it beat watching reruns or yet another inane reality show.  For children, I'd be careful letting younger kids watch. Some of the scenes would be really scary to a young child.
B000F8O4E0|5.0|Needed this to complete my collection--my previous copy was on vinyl, so I now have the complete collection on CD
B00006JI11|1.0|I have ordered many items from Amazon.com.  BUT this one takes the cake!  Nothing in the item description said anything about this DVD being for a specific region in order for it to play.  This was a Christmas gift and we have tried it in 4 DVD players and NONE of them will accept it :(
B003YL4LYI|5.0|The story is fantastic and I'm happy to say I didn't have any issues with the kindle version. I can't wait for the next book to come out.
B0052RE4MQ|3.0|I'm trying hard to hold on to reasoning to read the third and final of the trilogy after reading Crossed.  While Ms. Condie brought more elements and is just beginning to round out the edges of her fictional world, I still feel too much was predictable.  (And personally a little peeved she keeps blowing off Xander).  If you want to continue this series to finish out the series, that's commendable but otherwise, I don't see much motivation in it and the Rising doesn't give much motivation to continue reading either.  I sure hope #3 picks up the pace.
B005LAIH9A|5.0|We loved it. So great. Now that we are married with kids we relate so much. We went back and rewatched the others but we didn't laugh half as much as we did with this one. Definitely recommended!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game works great on my kindle fire. It is great to just kill some time. Coins regenerate while you aren't playing, so you do not have to actually spend real money on this game.
B008Y5OW20|4.0|Old songs revisited--as the title suggests--good listening, clever new slants on some old favourites, and a few new ones--great to have
