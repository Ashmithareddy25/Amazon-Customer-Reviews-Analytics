B008K9UZY4|2.0|I can't install it on my HTC Sensation.  It keeps telling me that I don't have enough room to install.  UPDATE:  I was eventually able to try it on both my phone and Kindle Fire.  However, it uses too much internal memory on my phone and cannot be moved to the SD card.  It also hogs a good portion of the application memory on my Kindle Fire and I had to remove it because I had no additional room for other applications.  Sega, please fix these space issues.

B004U8VUUC|3.0|I went into watching this film knowing from the start that the film-and the real lfe story behind it were mundane, but the whole point I believe is the injustice of the missing wife and her probable murderer never being charged with the real crime. I decided to watch because I have always wondered about homicide of a spouse, and wanted to see if the story shows their codependency. The answer is no, for the wife, (played by Dunst) seems intelligent but passive, -she aborts her child because that is her husbands wish--she decides not to divorce despite being beaten and abused--because she is used to living on his money and income. How many times in the real story did he beat on her, and she still comes back to her abuser? When he does an especially despicable act, she confronts him...somehow that does not seem like the wisest choice of action.<br />Although I sympathize with her, and the film obviously does, she brings on her own fate, after living with him for years, by ignoring the warning signs.

B007NUP80C|5.0|To quickly address other reviewers issues with \\"quality control\\" on the manufacture of this disk.  First off the \\"clicking\\" on track 3 \\"So Long\\"...RELAX people, it's the sound of Melody's fingernail tapping.  What amazes me is that people think it's a defect.  It's in time with the music for crying out loud.  Secondly...the \\"phantom 12th track\\"...lots of artists add things to their final track long after the listed tracks ends.  You can say you don't care for this choice, but to suggest there is something wrong with your disk is ludicrous.  You do not need a \\"full refund\\".<br /><br />As to the music, a select few folks have rated this album 1 star.  They want the \\"old formula\\" from this amazing artist.  It's unfortunate that they absolutely refuse to budge on the sound of an artist.  If you want \\"formula\\", check out the millions of other artists who won't step out of the box.  Diana Krall's amazing disk \\"Quiet Nights\\" got these same comments from listeners who only want the \\"same old thing\\" over & over & over.  Jazz music, bossa-type music, world music...they all share common threads that are explored on this disk.  Is it really so far removed from the \\"old\\" Melody?  I've enjoyed all her releases and for me, \\"The Absence\\" is my favorite by far and it only grows on me more each day I listen to it.  Her voice perfectly fits this style of music.  We'd all be in a better frame of mind if more artists could create something this beautiful.  In this hectic world weary environment we all live in, it makes my day a bit sunnier whenever I listen to it.  Something to be thankful for because of this wonderful artist.<br /><br />1. Mira - Upbeat & sunny.  Will cheer your mood instantly.<br /><br />2. Amalia - Wonderful acoustic guitar.  Bouncy & sweet.  Incredible chord changes.<br /><br />3. So Long - More great acoustic guitar & more beautiful chord changes.<br /><br />4. So We Meet Again My Heartache - An amazing sense of loss & longing.  Beautiful strings.  Her voice practically drips with the feelings that this song evokes.<br /><br />5. Lisboa - Lovely bells.  Again the amazing colors of love & longing are sung by her voice.  A nice male assist towards the end of the song.<br /><br />6. Impossible Love - A bit darker & sensual.  Evokes thoughts of two lovers dancing with love & hate playing between them.<br /><br />7. If I Tell You I Love You - A dark carnival-esque ride as if a sultry she-demon is on the prowl.  Haha!<br /><br />8. Goodbye - Another sassy dance of love & hate with great \\"wah wah\\" horns & Melody's voice trilling to a soft growl at times.  A clarinet snakes around the organ.<br /><br />9. Se Voce Me Ama - Beautiful acoustic guitar & a wonderful duet with Heitor Pereira.  Soft & lovely.<br /><br />10. My Heart Won't Have It Any Other Way - My favorite track after I saw the video of Melody & her photo shoot for this album.  She looks utterly & profoundly beautiful in the video and more importantly, the music is utterly & profoundly beautiful as well.  The video depicts her beauty & the fragility of life as she walks with her cane amid the roaring waves.  It truly is amazing to see.  If you close your eyes while listening, this piece of amazing music can transport you to a lovely otherworldly place.  It can move you to tears for how beautiful it is.<br /><br />11. Iemaja - A nice upbeat bouncy offering to close the album.  If this one doesn't get you swaying or dancing, nothing will.  Smiles will abound!<br /><br />12. Untitled - Although tracked with song #11 almost 12 minutes later beyond silence, it begins with church bells, then a sinuey saxophone, funky bass & drums, some pops & scratches as if from an old LP, bizarre guitars...some type of experimental psychedelic early 70's vibe...ending with the bells & crowd noises as a car drives away.  It would be interesting to know the history of this track & why it is on this album.  Strange & interesting non the less.<br /><br />Bottom line...if Melody continues down thispath in the future I'll be the first one aboard.  Instead of just \\"singing a song\\", the way she interprets the vibe of each song is so utterly believable that you feel she's reaching deep within her soul to coax the words out with that amazing voice.  I'll listen to this one on a regular basis for a long, long time to come.  Sublime!  Everything beautiful, wonderful & joyful that music can be, this album is.
B00000J7J4|5.0|What are you going to say about this.  It is the best thing I ever heard by Santana.  I love it.  He got together with vocalists way better than himself and focused on what he can really do (organize and play guitar).  It is tremendous.

B000FVE3A2|5.0|If you enjoy wearing a fine watch, and then worry the entire time you have it on, this might be be ideal for you.  At the Amazon price you can wear this watch everywhere and never worry about putting a scratch on the bracelet.  Best of all, you really don't compromise anything in terms of quality.  This thing is heavy and solid, yet amazingly comfortable.  It doesn't copy any specific expensive modlel (which can be embarrassing if someone is drawn to take a close look), but has its own subtle, classic style.  If you have friensds who wear the expensive brands you will not look or feel out of place wearing this. Maybe I was just lucky, but the Japanese self-wind unit in mine is spot on.  Set the time and date, wear it at least part of each day, and you are good to go .  In a world of hype and oversell, you will find this solid value to be a very pleasant surprise.

1439127700|5.0|A book to be read slowly in order to absorb the meaning of the content. what I am coming away with is that although these President have come from different political parties, their path through the Presidency has made them of one mind, The United State of America has done just that, they are united with one goal. Their union has totally impressed this totally jaded apolitical person.  The USA is the winner in the end.  very smart.
034580404X|1.0|I put spoiler alert in my review name, but honestly, if you read the first couple chapters of the first book, you'll spoil the rest of the series for yourself anyway.<br /><br />I don't usually write really harsh reviews unless a product has seriously disappointed me (see Simply Shabby Chic blanket review), but after spending $30 on this trash, I feel like this is that white blanket all over again. I hope this review will save someone their time and money.<br /><br />Some of my friends loved this book and raved about it, which is how I ended up buying it. But after reading a book and a half, I think the writing is tripe, to say the least, and utter garbage if I'm being brutally honest. First she rips off the Twilight series (the only possible reason she could want to rip off this series is mileage out of those characters for money in her pocket). It also rips off 9 1/2 Weeks, Pretty Woman, and pretty much every \\"heaving, throbbing, pulsing...romance\\" \\"novel\\" I've ever heard about. It also had a weird American Psycho feel (without the murders) to it as well, but maybe that was just me. The whole high-rise apartment and flashy this and ritzy that, had a very 80's vibe.<br /><br />I gave it one star because I couldn't give it negative 5 stars. I have no problem with kinky sex and I think what happens between two consenting adults is their business. But this money-making formulaic isn't about either of those things. The main character, Anastasia, is the typical \\"doesn't know how beautiful she is, but every boy loves her, whiny, infantile, moronic...\\" Well, picture Bella with a butt plug. I can't stress enough how lacking in character this \\"character\\" is. And those that claim this is a story of retribution or someone letting go of their abusive past because love opened their heart...meh. That part of the story line was just as weak as the rest. There is NOTHING original or fresh, or even an original and fresh perspective on anything, presented in these books. It's all rip-offs.<br /><br />The two main characters are almost IDENTICAL to Edward and Bella. And Jose, the \\"best friend who is already in love with main character\\", is a latino Jacob. Anastasia describes her mom as having \\"the attention span of a goldfish\\", and quips that she hopes she didn't mortgage her house on her latest scheme, (paraphrased), but you get the idea. Anastasia's mom is almost EXACTLY like Bella's mom. And Ray is Charlie...quiet, soft-spoken, loves to fish...well, you get the idea. She's got Stephenie Meyer's formula down pat. The piano sex scene is EXACTLY like Pretty Woman, right down to the soft tinkling as her feet slide across the piano keys. And so on, and so on. Maybe she thought people wouldn't remember since that movie was from the 90's...?<br /><br />Other reviewers said there should have only been one book, that the redundancy of the sex scenes just got plain ol' boring after a while. I agree, but I think they're being generous. I could have done without even one of these rip-offs.<br /><br />Save your money. Re-read Harry Potter. Go buy all seven books if you don't own them already. That series is worth much more than what you'll pay for it. If you don't like Harry Potter, read ANYTHING by Stephen King. All of his are worth much more than their retail as well. I could name a bunch more actual authors that are worth their weight in gold, but I don't want to be redundant. I'll leave that to E.L. James.

B000VLE3GA|5.0|Love this and great quality when received.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|In Sci-Fi/Fantasy, premise and depth are essential.  Creating a world out of whole cloth requires a lot of insight and consideration of how humans, technology (or magic) and culture combine.  Changing one requires changes to all of them in some respects.  Great ideas come where the author has rolled that world around in their mind awhile and considered it from many angles.  Hugh Howey has done an amazing job of just that in the Wool Omnibus edition.<br /><br />While some parts are a \\"little\\" rushed (the underwater dive sequence), the story has some very strong technology and character development that goes beyond the obvious.<br /><br />This story is a good adventure and keeps the reader interested and actively engaged.  There are enough questions still remaining that a reader's imagination will rush to fill in the blanks.  When a book starts invading my dreams for \\"what if's\\" that fit within the environment the author has created, they have not only written an great story, but created an amazing world.<br /><br />I actually donated $5 directly to the author after finishing the 6th book in this series (prequel really).  Never in my life have I felt a need to tip an author, but Hugh Howey needs to keep writing and deserves to rise up out of the ebook wasteland to get noticed immediately.

B005MYEQ9U|5.0|\\"Success, triumph, delirium -- it seemed the public had gone mad. Everyone says they cannot recall a triumph so complete.\\"<br />The words are Donizetti's, writing home after the premiere of his Anna Bolena at Milan on 26 December, 1830. The role of the heroine was then sung by Giuditta Pasta, the astonishing soprano who on that same day the following year was to be the first Norma, who earlier in 1831 sang Amina in the premiere of Bellini's La sonnambula and in 1833 created the role of Donizetti's Beatrice di Tenda.<br /><br />Operatic legend once had it that in the autumn of 1830--whose beginning saw the premiere in Paris of that source of the romantic movement, Victor Hugo's Hernani--both Bellini and Donizetti were working at Lake Corno on operatic commissions from the impresario of the Teatro Carcano, Milan, Bellini staying at Moltrasio with Giuditta Turina on one side, Donizetti on the other at Blevio with Giuditta Pasta. Each composer had a libretto from the celebrated Felice Romani and each was determined to outdo the other. Like mostt legends, the facts are a little different; Donizetti's libretto for Anna Bolena was in his hands on November 10th (the composition was finished by December 10th), Bellini's for La Sonnambula only in December.<br /><br />At the time of Donizetti's death, the critic of the Revue des Deux Mondes pointed to five of his operas as most likely to survive: Lucia, La Favorite, L'Elisir, Don Pasquale and Anna Bolena, and certainly the opera was in as high favor with the public as with prima donnas, who found a perfect vehicle for their gifts in Anna's `Piangete voi?' and `Al dolce guidami', a mad scene to vie with those from Sonnambula and Puritani, Lucia and Linda. In the 1950's, Anna Bolena was one of the most successful of the several operas to benefit from the revival of interest in bel canto that owed its impulse initially to the sovereign interpretative powers of Maria Callas.<br /><br />It was with Callas in the title role and in a magnificent production by Luchino Visconti that the opera triumphed at la Scala in 1957, repeating the delirious success of the premier 127 years earlier.  Alas, we do not have a video with aforementioned Queens of bel canto; yet how fortunate we are to see the new Queen making her regal entrance in the role.<br /><br />La Netrebko is so glorious as the wounded Queen that it is quite difficult to imagine anyone in the past possibly being better.  The beauty of her tone, the richness and evenness of her timbre are simply unique; perhaps Callas sounded as great at a live performance, but from the recording we can hear a very expressive performance [[ASIN:B00000630Z Donizetti: Anna Bolena (complete opera live 1957) with Maria Callas, Gianni Raimondi, Gianandrea Gavazzeni, Orchestra & Chorus of La Scala, Milan]] but not as impressive vocally as Netrebko's extraordinary interpretation.<br /><br />Anna's Anna captivates the audience with the plush sensuality of her voice, chiseled phrasing, highly nuanced attack.  No wilting violet is she, but a proud and ferocious tigress, just as the real Anna Boleyn was in real life.  It was that extraordinary strength of her character and celebrated intelligence that warranted her demise from the crowned male filled with deep-seated insecurity and inferiority, obviously grounded in impaired sexuality.  As often happens in such unions, the weak and inferior initially strongly admires an exceptional figure, as Anna Boleyn was when returned from France - highly educated, cultured, elegant and enthralling; but then, unable to measure up, destroys the source of the constant reminder of own inadequacy.<br /><br />It must be said that the historic Anna Bolena was not just an innocent victim;  she was a highly energetic intrigant actively involved in the plot against Henry VIII first wife Catherine of Aragon, and even more infamously, in the execution of Sir Thomas More.  The latter tragedy is a conspicuous parallel to another royal story ofPoppea, whose influence over Nero brought the downfall of Seneca [[ASIN:B000JJSRMK Monteverdi - L'Incoronazione di Poppea]].<br /><br />I could not fail to notice a few parallels with another fascinating doomed heroine of the opera, although a very different one - Manon Lescault by Puccini.  As with Anna Bolena being Donizetti's first opera,  same is true for Puccini's Manon Lescault.  And as with Donizetti's Anna, it was the scheming brother in both operas whose reckless insistence brings about the sister's destruction.<br /><br />Another star in the evening was Elina Garanca, and really judging by these two ladies physical and vocal beauty one can appreciate the opportunities of choice available to powerful tyrants.  Garanca gives equally stunning performance as Netrebko; her luscious mezzo is a perfect match for the incomparable soprano.  I also loved the historical accuracy of their portraits - Anna was a brunette, while Jane Seymor was a blonde, and a younger one, too, although no one could call Garanca's Seymor submissive - something that according to historic accounts was her main quality that attracted the desperate despot.<br /><br />Henry VIII probably never looked such a sexy brute as Ildebrando d'Arcangelo.  His famous Holbein's portrait [[ASIN:B007WUW02W Henry VIII,Holbein,Earl of Egremont ;Wm. Derby,T A Dean]] shows us quite an abominable figure, matched by his misdeeds.  Yet d'Arcangelo gives a formidable performance.  The decidedly covered tone adopted throughout his range brought the most menacing nuance to its finest.<br /><br />Francesco Meli's Lord Riccardo Percy was excellent, although his squillo was at times forced and his timbre thin in the top of his range.  I saw him in live performances a few times - once in Pesaro in 2006 where he was simply sensational, and another time last October in Parma, at Verdi's Requiem, where he was astonishing.  But this role is obviously larger than Requem's tenor, and although he is still so great in it, it seemed as he struggled a bit at times with its demands.  I do admire his singing here nevertheless, because while there are recordings with great voices singing Percy, we don't know how they would sound in a live performance.  My most recent experience at Teatro del Maggio Musicale Fiorentino was quite poor when it comes to Percy - it's enough to hear a very mediocre one (it was Shalva Mucheria) to appreciate the mastery of Franceso Meli.<br /><br />Elisabeth Kulman was very good as Smeton, although this is the only role that the Florentine production provided at the same level - Jose Maria Lo Monaco was as eqally delighful Smeton.  Lo Monaco is quite an comparable contralto.<br /><br />And one of the main reasons which made this Vienna production such a delirious triumph was the musical direction of Evelino Pido.  He drew magnificent playing from Weiner Staatsoper orchestra.  He mastered the emotional ebb and stylish restrain, never once overwhelming a voice, allowing us to savor every syllable of this deeply felt interpetation of an opera that can be rightfully considered Donizetti's masterpiece.  I had an opportunity to further appreciate Evelino Pido's genius when I was at Rossini's Otello in Brussels this May; he made a sensational representation of that opera that otherwise remains in  obscure slumber on a few recordings available.  Truly there is nothing that can replace a live performance of a piece of classical music, and it is a wonder of life when it exceeds all possible expectations.<br /><br />For me, every moment on March 15, 2012 in Teatro del Maggio  where I was listening to \\"Anna Bolena\\" with Mariella Devia in the title role and Sonia Ganassi as Jane Seymor was ringing with memories of this Viennese musical feast.  Even though the Teatro del Maggio production by Graham Vick was much more lavish, ornate and inventive, it could not save the vocal deficiency of most singers.  I include links in comments section for comparison.<br /><br />This Anna's Anna is a must-see; a counsel already firmly supported by countless admirers, and in this case exceptionally well-deserved.<br /><br />Bravissimi!seemed as he struggled a bit at times with its demands.

Two twenty something year olds with traumatic events from childhood.

I've seen reviews of the book stating the sex was unrealistic and woman don't really want men like Cross. I don't agree at all. People like different things and I suggest reading the book for yourself.

0345803485|1.0|And I do mean god-awful! Fortunately, I did not waste my hard earned money on this piece of drivel (checked it out from the library and then promptly returned it after getting about 100 pages in).  Seriously one of the worst reads I've had in a long time.  I think I prefer reading the back of the cereal box over this garbage.  Bad writing, bad dialogue, idiotic characters etc.  It is really beyond me how this book is managing to average a 3 star rating on Amazon.  So I felt it was my duty to add yet another 1 star review (although it really deserves zero) to hopefully bring that average down and reflect the true rating of this book.  I even tried making a 2nd and 3rd attempt to get past the 100 pages but alas, I just couldn't take it any more!! So I \\"pursed my lips\\" and \\"peeked up through my eylashes\\" at the book return box and dropped them in.  My \\"mouth was in a hard line\\" afterwards but I knew I did the right thing.  That by the way is just a few examples of the bad writing you will experience if you choose to read this book and waste precious hours of your life.  If you do succumb to the hype and end up reading it, do yourself a favor and borrow it (definitely dont beg or steal as the book is not worth it) and save your money.

At first it lagged like crazy and the reviews say it all but I think some players are being impatient...I don't know if you all are stranded in the middle of Antarctica and this game lags continuously but where I come from it does tend to lag but you gotta wait for like 2 minutes if that doesn't work then move from the Jungle or wherever the hell you are.(
B00378VGGO|5.0|Great movie.  I like how you can make the connection between humans living a domestic life and a wild animal doing the same and it is difficult.  Humans still have urges to do things that go against the domestic life whether it is dangerous adventure or other things just like the fox wanted to rob the farms again after he promised not to and had a family since it is the natural instinct for foxes to hunt.  Great movie.

B000ECX0QU|2.0|Read no further, if you are concerned about \\"spoilers\\"....<br /><br />The IMDb explains that this film concerns \\"Cold War politics,\\" including parts \\"leading up to the 1962 Cuban Missle Crisis.\\"  Being a Hitchcock fan, I'd been eager to see this film, after learning of at least one scene filmed in NYC.  Unfortunately, this film does NOT measure up to Hitchcock quality.  A review on the web site of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops describes it well:<br />* \\"The dialogue is mostly banal and the action largely unconvincing, but there are occasional glimmers of the Hitchcock touch in subtle plot twists here and blind alleys there....Some physical and psychological violence and a lot of confusing intrigue.\\"
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I've been a fan of Rush for over 30 yrs.  My first memories of them are an older friend talking about \\"212\\", then another buddy (who's uncle played in a band from Canada) bringing in \\"Permanent Waves\\" when we were in high school.  I was in kind of an \\"in-between\\" stage musically.  I love Kiss, but didn't care for the \\"poppy\\" direction they were heading in.  I loved all of the classic bands of the time, but when I heard Rush, I was blown away.  I was a budding drummer just starting to play in some bands, and when I heard Neil Peart I thought, \\"I've got a lot of work to do!\\"  I'd never have the nerve to put myself in Neil's class! But about the new album...I absolutely love it.  I bought the 2 tunes in '10 that were released on itunes, and got sick of them a bit from playing them so much.  But hearing how they work with the rest of the album, I'm not sick of them any more.  They are a bit different on the album too.  Rush is still my favorite band, I have everything of their's...cd's, dvd's, blurays...I hope to see them on this tour, as I've never seen them live!
B008JH5CVS|2.0|This movie is very similar to the made for Scyfy Channel movies. It just does not work. I slept through much of it. The movie is shot in constant motion style and gave me a headache. The action is so chaotic that I gave up trying to follow it.
B003ZFCBJ0|4.0|I had very low expectations going in. I was in the mood for a love story, and I was curious to see the now newly-engaged couple interact on the big screen.<br /><br />Boy, was I in for a surprise. The movie is remarkably good. Usually these movies don't turn out so well and you're left with the feeling ... wish I hadn't wasted time on this one. But Last Song is just the opposite. In fact, I watched it twice.<br /><br />It has all the good elements that make a romantic movie good, and a few of the expected plot points and storylines, of course. But every bit of it is well done -- from the beautiful cinematography to the honest acting to the tug at your heartstrings moments.<br /><br />I'm not gonna rehash the plot -- there is enough of that in other reviews here. All of the actors large and small ... the young boy is very good ... do their roles proud. And it's not so predictable that you feel you always knows what comes next.<br /><br />It's a chick flick for sure, but you can drag your date to it. He'll like watching Miley while you languish on Liam.  Admittedly, Liam is twice as handsome now, some 5 years later. But his character and portrayal of the character are good enough to keep you interested.<br /><br />When you feel like chillin' out ... want a sweet Sunday afternoon treat ... or just want to share your loving feelings with your latest squeeze, Last Song is the movie to see.  So many of these types of movies are so bland and done so poorly that you can't enjoy them. At last, we have one that breaks the mold and does it right!

0307716988|5.0|I really enjoyed reading Michael Jackson's autobiography! I have been a fan of his music my whole life, thanks to my parents who introduced me to the Jackson 5 and MJ's early solo music, when I was a child. In my junior high school years, I discovered Michael Jackson for myself, and became a true fan. ..Not only of his music, but of him as a person. All these years later, reading his autobiography was a wonderful experience for me. It just verified everything I already thought about him - that he was a good guy, who made good (great) music, and had a good heart. I wish I could have been his friend. Greatest entertainer ever!!!

B007J4T2G8|4.0|I found myself smiling through many parts of the book, the writing style is fun, engaging, and escapist. It's an easy read, entertaining, and I thought the female character was relatable with her humor and wit. Yes, the whole story is not really believable, but I enjoyed it because it's a guilty pleasure and the characters were fun.

B005WTR4ZI|3.0|Pros:<br />- short read (and inexpensive to buy)<br />- well written and to the point<br />- decent primer on the larger structural trends affecting unemployment, especially in the most recent recession/depression<br />- optimistic view of how individuals will be empowered to become global entrepreneurs by rich technology like Amazon, Etsy, Google ads, and of course the artificial intelligence marvels of the future<br />- smart quotations from Aristotle and Keynes :)<br /><br />Cons:<br />- most of the points should be familiar and obvious if you read financial news and tech blogs, e.g. increasing income disparity, technology developing exponentially faster and obsoleting humans, globalization and digitalization creating winner-take-all market dynamics, etc.<br />- no bold predictions of the future and recommendations on how to cope with the huge social dislocations (the authors admit that re-education of low-skilled obsoleted workers does not work, and government handouts don't do much for morale)<br />- no mention how the ongoing centralization of income and power, combined with ever more powerful technology could result in oppressive dystopia<br /><br />If you have lived under a rock and did not know about Moore's law, Google's self-driving cars and natural language processing, or the jobless recession recovery and falling real median incomes in the US, this book is for you. I give it 3 stars because it is very well written and mercifully short.
0684803356|2.0|This book has great passages, as other reviewers have pointed out, like Pilar's tale or El  Sordo's last stand, but is otherwise too long. It has three major flaws:<br /><br />1. The hero's love interest, Maria, is a uninteresting and unattractive. Most of the other characters feel like flesh-and-blood, flawed people, but, for reasons I can't fathom, the author gave Maria the psychological depth of a pet.<br />2. The hero's dialogs with Spaniards are in a distracting and ridiculous form, resulting in lines like \\"Eatest thou always onions for breakfast?\\"<br />3. The characters' swearing is clumsily bleeped out, with lines like \\"Obscenity thy mother!\\" At first, I thought  that the Kindle edition I was reading had been censored, and returned it. I switched to Scribner's 1968 print edition, and found the same. I cannot believe that Hemingway actually wrote that way.<br /><br />Another strange passage that is also dating the book is one where the hero views himself as \\"taking part in a crusade,\\" adding \\"That was the only word for it although it was a word that had been so worn and abused that it no longer gave its true meaning.\\" And what exactly is the true meaning of \\"crusade\\"? Historians have long known that crusaders were nothing but thugs rampaging through the Middle-East. Even Voltaire wrote about it in the mid 18th century; [[ASIN:0805208984 The Crusades Through Arab Eyes]], 23 years ago. Yet Europeans and Americans have, until recently, used the crusades as a symbol of a generous and benevolent undertaking. Even [[ASIN:080185668X Crusade in Europe]]referred to the liberation of Europe as a \\"crusade.\\"

B001AI7KAE|5.0|When I received the \\"Grandes Exitos\\" disk with their latest \\"Cometas\\" disk for Christmas this past year,I didn't know whether I would even like them.  Well I listened to them, and even with their quirky female singer they rock, Spanish Style!  Their lead singer actually puts the icing on the sound that I can say defines La Oreja de Van Gogh.  After being spoiled with Amaral, and really enjoying their style so so much, here comes a very pop oriented sound that just seems to hit the right note (no pun intended) for my personal musical taste.<br />Its rather obvious after listening to LOVG for several months now that they are as competitive as any band out there.  This disk represents their best, and it doesn't disappoint.  If you enjoy music with a purpose, and a tremendous dose of musicality, GET THIS RECORD!  It will addict you.<br /><br />Starman Florida
B00009L1TA|2.0|OK. This is one of those twists & turns flicks that takes you on a roller-coaster ride as the plot zigs one way and then zags the other way. Which is fine. Unless the movie is based on some people sitting around in a room trying to think up a good movie and coming up with a plot wound around the twists & turns approach... simply because it is a proven formula. It's called putting the cart before the horse.<br /><br />In short, the negative reviews of this movie are dead on. I streamed it up on Netflix, not because it had Jackson (who seems to be in about every other movie these days), or because of Travolta (because he is not a sure bet in a film), but because of Nielsen, who is a fabulous actress, and, if you check out her bio, one hell of a talented human being in general. But her great talent was not put to good use in this film. Rather, she was turned into a tough, kick-ass cop, who can throw a man twice her size and weight across the room with a quick-cut martial art move (another proven formula that those folks sitting around in a room came up with for this flick).<br /><br />But the other, more interesting device employed in this film is the multiple viewpoint story, where each witness to an event tells a slightly different version of the \\"truth\\". In this flick you have the witnesses intentionally lying about what happened though. Far more interesting is the adaptation where each witness to the event tells the absolute truth about what they saw, yet they all contradict each other. This version of the varying witness accounts has more application to real life. We all can recall times when we have experienced a dilemma of this sort in our own lives. It's an aspect of the human condition, and can be quite disturbing at times.<br /><br />The quintessential multiple account story told in movie form could well be Akira Kurosawa's 'Rashomon' from 1950. If you don't care for subtitled foreign films, Kurosawa's script was adapted for the Western audience in 1964 as 'The Outrage', starring William Shatner and Edward G. Robinson.<br /><br />There's also an adaption of this general motif utilized by the great Alfred Hitchcock in his 1950's made for TV series \\"Alfred Hitchcock Presents' entitled 'I Killed the Count'. In this venue multiple people all confess to the same murder, and there is physical evidence supporting each person's story!<br /><br />And finally a bonus 4th title: 'The Situation' with Connie Nielsen brings home the point of how elusive the \\"truth\\" can be in a story of a Journalist seeking such in Iraq.<br /><br />Any one of these titles will provide more satisfaction than the product of self-abuse upchucked up by those folks who sit around in a room coming up with ways to lighten our wallets.he Outrage', starring William Shatner and Edward G.

B0079XPUOW|5.0|If the title didn't tip you off, Redshirts is Scalzi's  loving parody of Star Trek.  All the familiar characters and tropes are there, even if the names have been changed to protect the (not so) innocent.  I found it to be a fast and hilarious read - if anything I kept having to stop to read portions to my longsuffering wife.  The 3 codas add a nice balance to the book with their poignancy.  Highly recommended.

B00846REIS|1.0|I am not a reader by any stretch of the word. After I heard some hype about fifty shades, I gave it a whirl and fell in love. I thought that would even spiral a love of reading, so talking with some girlfriends one suggested this book if I loved \\"Fifty\\" so much. I wasn't into Fifty shades because of the raunchy-ness, I liked the story of this not-so-dark dark guy and an utterly defiantly in-love girl. It was fun to read their story. I bought this book without even sampling it and I am kicking myself for doing so. I wish I could get my money back. It is a total rip off from Fifty, within the first couple pages there are way too many similarities and found it incredibly hard to read.<br />I thought maybe I just didn't love reading after all? There was another book I had wanted to read for a while so I tried the sample of that book. Completely different genre all together. Within the first 5 pages I am already hooked into that book. So it isn't me after all. I guess they should recommend this book only to people looking to further the raunchy aspect and not looking for a new twisted lover story line.
0061537969|5.0|What a brilliant way to learn about life lessons.  SO eloquently written from the perspective of a beloved Golden Retriever.  Being the dog lover that I am, I know how intelligent and observant they are, and this well, and thoughtfully written book just made me realize even more how much joy and value they bring to our human lives.  I read this first as a library book, but I will read it again...and again.  I will buy this book and keep it on my bedside table as a treasured comforting friend to revisit when ever I wish.<br />Thank you Garth for such a brilliant work...

B007JWKLMO|5.0|It's official. I now like Martin Scorsese's documentaries more than his dramatic films.  I smiled through all four hours of this movie in which the quiet Beatle is not so quiet, nor are those close to him quiet about him. We really get a good look here at a man who made the most of what the world gave him, and who was quite aware of what it all meant in close to real time.  That is rare. Most of us, myself included, figure out why we did what we did a bit later, looking back, sorting through it all.<br /><br />And, without coming out and saying it, the film illuminates why the East-meets-West spiritual path Harrison walked (and pioneered) was such a perfect fit and a success for him, while others, famous and not-so-famous, only managed to annoy those around them with similar inner journeyings. The reason TM and mantras and Krishna-consciousness worked for Harrison is that they were not empty exercises in \\"self-actualization\\".  He also walked the walk in the materiel world, as demonstrated by his deep love, devotion, and service to others--and his love of life.
B00393SFU2|3.0|Don't get me wrong - the movie is great - one of my favorites.  My rating is for the package only.  However, I do not see much difference between the Blu-ray and the DVD I already own - except for some clarity.  The content is the same except for the English language audio version, which I don't feel was done very well.  Assuming it is a product of the times when it was done, maybe it's just the best they could do.  However, I prefer the original German with English sub-titles.  All in all, I regret having bought the blu-ray version which is basically, just over-priced.

B005ZOCF5E|5.0|The best thing about a Reynold's novel is the incredible reality of the future world and of course, his wonderful characters.  A major drawback to most most science fiction is the cartoonish nature of the characters - wonderful scientist, evil businessman, altruistic politician, kid genius, etc.  Reynolds never fails to surprise.  The African setting was slightly unnerving and I braced myself for an orgy of \\"bad colonialism / racial\\" discourses but thankfully, the author was an adult.  Race was simply a physical aspect, like height, weight or beauty.  While I find it far-fetched that Africa has become the dominant player (along with India and China) I will bequeath literary license.<br /><br />As is usual in a Reynolds \\"hero\\", Geoffrey is conflicted, this time between his legendary family and their company spanning the Solar System and his devotion to elephants.  Sunday, his sister, shares the spotlight and she is not conflicted - great presentation.  I mentioned that Reynolds draws the reader into the story as chings, smart matter, robots and Panspermic Societies seem almost real.  But even better, this is set in the NEAR future, a rarity in science fiction.  The Singularity that is featured in many of his stories was not allowed to happen in this future timeline although (****  WARNING - Spoiler  ****) its presence and possible usage becomes a major part of the plot.<br /><br />If there is one negative it is the chase, the series of clues left by the family matriarch.  They are too obscure, too likely never to be understood (or answered) and they seem forced at times.  But the author ties it all together with an electrifying yet soothing ending. This is not the far-future space opera many expected but, like his previous book, it is an excellent read.
B007CKNX28|5.0|when i first listened to this disk i instantly thought, modern day classic rock n roll ablum. then a few more listens i was kind of wishing it had more guitar in the songs. you know, his famous distorted riffs. then a few more listens i didnt even care. this album was just to damn classic. if you like some good ol rock n roll then get this album. almost positive you wont be let down. later

030758836X|2.0|This book did not live up to the hype for me. Two despicable people in a depressing marriage do crappy things to each other. It was interesting for awhile but ultimately unsatisfying and left a bad taste in my mouth.
B005LAIH3G|2.0|I have been a great fan of ERB's Martian novels since I first read them in the 1960's, so I looked forward to this movie with great anticipation.  I saw it in the theater and was extremely impressed with its visual presentation.  This is the reason I purchased this DVD collection.  In my opinion, they got the \\"look and feel\\" of the novels just right.  The creatures, fliers, and weapons were beautifully rendered and, for the most part, quite faithful to the books.  Both the BluRay and the standard DVD disk in this set faithfully reproduced the theatrical experience and I am very satisfied with them.  I do not have 3D capability yet so I was not able to try the 3D version.<br /><br />Unfortunately, as good as the creature effects and other special effects are in this movie, they cannot make up for the butchered story and characterizations in this production.  You would think that if a story were successful for 100 years, as this one is, the Disney crowd would not mess too much with the story line.  But, apparently they decided to make this movie into a hodgepodge of the first three books of the Martian series and they did it very badly.  This resulted in a confusing screenplay and a lack of deeply felt motivation for the characters.<br /><br />The most egregious mischaracterization was John Carter, himself.  In the movie he is portrayed as a very ordinary human who happened to be a great Civil War warrior, disgruntled and disillusioned after the loss of his wife to marauders.  ERB's John Carter is a very mysterious man, not remembering his childhood and remembering always being about 35 years old.  None of this mystery came across in the movie.  In the books, he was never married and had an upbeat and positive attitude.  I guess the thinking was that an upbeat, positive hero would not \\"sell\\" in today's market. Instead of an aloof princess, Dejah Thoris is portrayed as a warrior scientist, working on a secret weapon as if it were a high school science project.  I guessit is no longer politically correct to portray a woman's strength as arising simply from her beauty and femininity, she now must carry a sword!  The best characterizations were Woola and the Tharks, they were the characterizations most faithful to the books.<br /><br />Reminscent of movies such as Avatar, another bow to political correctness was the portrayal of Zodanga as a mobile industrial city bent on the distruction of Barsoom (Mars) for no apparent reason.  In the books, it was actually industrial operations, in the form of atmosphere plants, that were keeping Barsoom alive.  But, the worst plot deficiency, in my mind, was making the Therns into a race of godlike creatures who actually had real power and who were responsible for the transporation of Carter to Mars and back to Earth.  A lot of the fun of the novels was how Carter dealt with the Therns and how he revealed them to be the frauds that they were.  In the film, the Therns are not frauds!  Also, the Thern's ninth ray super weapon, which never existed in the books, is an unnecessary plot device reminiscent of the sonic blasters (weirding modules) introduced by David Lynch in his poorly received version of another great science fiction novel, Frank Herbert's Dune.  To me, introduction of extraneous plot devices such as these weapons reveals lack of confidence in plot development and characterizations on the part of the film makers.  Also, the film makers seemed to want to explain everything, like how Carter got to Mars and back, instead of leaving things just a little mysterious.<br /><br />The reasons listed above are just some of the reasons why this movie was so poorly attended in theaters.  It is too bad.  I think the makers of this film missed a chance to produce something very different than what you find in todays market.  All they had to do was to have the courage to stick closer to the book, be retro and a little mysterious, and do a movie which subscribed to the ideals of industriousness, courage, and loyalty.  Instead, what we got is your standard action hero fare with great action and special effects, but full of preachy poitical correctness, gimmicky plot devices, and flat characters.

I absolutely Loved the books - and the last one 50 shades freed was absolutely spell binding.  I can't wait for the movie, but the cast has to be right on.  I fell in love with each character.  I have recommended reading this to all my friends.  I have to thank the writer for such entertaining reading.  I found myself getting up in the middle of the night just to read one more chapter.  I read all three books in 1-1/2 weeks.  I could not put them down.  I say to all my friends if you have not read these books you are truly missing out - - -.  What an escape.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|A bit too simplistic. I love characters who are physically appealing in every way, but at least the author should play up some weak qualities, as we the readers also want to read books with characters who are at least believable and relatable. In my opinion, unless a novel is fantasy where some of its characters are out of this world and possess superhuman qualities, then at least some human imperfection should be revealed. But I do give E.L James credit for her success; it isn't an easy task writing a novel and getting published, much less to have it become famous world wide.
0553108034|5.0|I'm going to keep this short. This book is one of the best fantasy books ever written. It is a great installment to the series and does not disappoint.
0345803485|1.0|this book is not much better than the myriad of exploitation films that used to plague drive-in theaters, disgusting and rancid this book represents everything that is wrong for humanity, and it has delusions of grandeur. I look forward to the film, it has been a while since we have had some high budget schlock like Caligula.
0553801503|2.0|This book is the first in the series in which I feel like there is no coherent plot or story line. I'm not sure who are the protagonists or the antagonists. I've almost forgotten why I enjoyed the story line in the previous books so much in the first place. I found myself at the end of this book not just skimming paragraphs but skipping them entirely because of the tedium. After reading this we are now faced with choices. Do we continue to drudge on hoping that the story can be revitalized to its previous greatness? Or do we decide this is a waste of our time as there are a lot of good stories out there to read and we only have a finite time on this earth to read them? As for my part, I have invested to much time already to just give up. If A Dance With Dragons is not a vast improvement then I'll be leaving this series unfinished.
B005K17RU0|5.0|it seems to be working fine on the fire now. no problems with getting the city.nice to be able to check weather quickly for travel.
0553106635|5.0|I'm going to keep this short. This book is one of the best fantasy books ever written. It is a great installment to the series and does not disappoint...I wish the same could be said for A Feast For Crows.
0345803485|5.0|I don't know why so many people have such bad reviews about this book. I never read books they usually bore me and everyone was decribing this book as a \\"porn\\" type which is another reason why i didn't want to read it and I'm glad i gave the book the benefit of the doubt this Trilogy blew me away. I couldn't keep my eyes out of them. Every free second I got I was reading.<br />Now with all that being said the ending of the trilogy was very dissappointing to me. I did not like the way the book left you hanging and the first epilogue was good but the next 2 i was not so impressed with. I also did not like E.L. James finishing line in the book of \\"That's all.....for now\\" kinda got me wondering what she meant by that Is there going to be a book 4?
0553103547|5.0|I'm going to keep this short. This book is one of the best fantasy books ever written. If you don't read this book you are missing out on the best fantasy has to offer.
034580404X|4.0|Have not read it all yet but its a nice box set for the money.  Very inexpensive on amazon.com  Thanks for the hours of lost time in books I will enjoy.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|A typical Apple-branded product -- it just works!<br /><br />A must have adapter for the new MacBook Pro-Retina if you want to plug into a network instead of using WiFi.<br /><br />Nothing to setup. Just plug it into one of the Thunderbolt ports, open System Preferences>Network and set up \\"Thunderbolt Ethernet.\\"<br /><br />This adapter should have been included with the MacBook Pro-Retina, not an extra cost purchase!
B002MQYOFW|2.0|so...bad! when i got this, i thought it was the awesome, eventful book everyone said it was. its not! dont waste your time!
0345529057|5.0|This was a must read after watching HBO series.  I like the book version on which the show is based.  Couldnt stand the thought of waiting until next year to see what transpires....love it i'm on 3rd book...,
B008KMHFJY|5.0|amazing book loved the love story an easy read would definately suggest to friends and family didnt want the book to end i wish there was a sequel
B008ALA6DW|4.0|Granted, this product is nice but I'd advise anyone to think twice about their needs before purchasing. I realized after I got it that a MacBook Air can only take one thunderbolt adapter. And the reason I usually need an adapter is because I'm at a conference podium where the wifi isn't usable. You can't use both this and a display port adapter at the same time so I had to also get a USB adapter.<br /><br />This adapter is super fast so I plan to keep it for any time I need to do big transfers. But definitely consider your needs a bit more carefully than I did.
B0060QM0AG|5.0|I have heard about this book and its sequels before, but I guess I remembered it somewhere on the background of my mind. When I saw by accident that this book was on sale, I bought it. I thought it started slowly - just as life in English countryside in the 1930s must have been slow and unhurried. We meet the young veterinarian who  also narrates the story when his practice just begins and with him we get to know \\"all creatures great and small\\" whom he meets, helps to get better when he can or helps to end their sufferings when he can't. I thought this book was full of love in the best way and very well written.
B001O80G60|5.0|Fans of Pantera will probably agree that this is their best album.  There is not a weak track on the album and if you are even somewhat familiar with Pantera then you probably know most of them very well already.  Fans new to Pantera should start with this album since its their best.  \\"Cowboys From Hell\\" and \\"Far Beyond Driven\\" are also great but this one is their crowning achievement and made them metal superstars.  And for good reason!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wonderfully written and I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Wool Omnibus Edition\\".  Excellent read that I will recommend to people I know.  Thank you for an extremely good story.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Thank you for this Bible. I love it especially the voice feature. I wish I could get the voice feature for The New king James version.<br />God bless you<br />Joe
B007H7XJD4|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. It was full of action. I thought it was well done. Good flow. Not everyone who watched it here liked it as much as I did. But I thought it was a good movie.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|good game with levels. it captures you and makes you want to play more. the levelscare money systems are great.
B00701L5XS|1.0|When opening this app on the Galaxy Tab 7, it loads then locks up and the device has to be turned off.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|My daughters and I love this movie.  Steve Carrel adds something special to everything he does-this is no exception.  The big bad guy gets a 2nd chance at life after adopting 3 little girls who melt his heart.
B0053VKP8S|4.0|I bought a new plasma tv and wanted to use my old receiver which had no optical inputs.  This product was easy to set up (purchased an Amazon brand Optical cable).  The AC adapter provided did not work.  Fortunately I was able to use a USB cable that I had laying around to power the device from one of my TV's USB ports.  Contacted the seller about getting a new AC adapter but haven't heard back yet.
B000002UDG|5.0|This CD is the best!!! I am a new Amazon customer and this was my first purchase.  This music comes from a time when music was great and while i was never a HUGE Beatles fan (tho they were fabulous for sure!)  there are songs on this CD that truly touch and warm my heart!  you rock Paul McCartney- you and your band!  This CD is great quality and I AM LOVING IT and enjoying it soooo!  thanks!  wooooot woooo!
B003YL4LYI|4.0|it is slower than the other books, but still teeming with details and context. can't wait for the next book.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is an amazing game and i would recommend it to ANYONE!!! It is a kid friendly, Fun Family  game!!!!!! + its FREE!!!!!! how much more better could it get.....
B006BDHAX0|4.0|Freezing problem fixed, great new boards! Can't wait to take this with me on my vacation. It will help on the long plane ride.
030758836X|2.0|This book was on a list for good summer reading.  The characters were interesting and story kept you wondering what would happen next.  However, the ending was so disappointing that both my husband and I were sorry we read it.
0545101417|5.0|Enjoyed this Audio Book as much as the original.  Have the final one and will start on it very soon.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, it was a great read. I would purchase more books from this Author.  One of the fastest books I have read.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|I am a new proud owner of my Kindle. It was a gift and I have to say a great one at that. This app is very functional and really helps me keep track of time left on battery, and it lets you know how much energy you will use depending on how you are using your kindle. It does everthing it said it would do. A great help....Amazon has great apps and I am glad I choice to be a premium member. I can not believe the value of joining Amazon...Thanks Amazon
B0055SWM08|5.0|Easy to pick up and learn, but difficult to master. addictive in that you want to find the shortest solution for each puzzle. Highly recommended!
B007JWKLP6|5.0|An absolute MUST for any fan of any of The Beatles or the group. Insight in the life of \\"the quiet Beatle\\"<br />will have you watching the DVD over and over. A beautiful look into a man who taught us \\"WHAT IS LIFE\\".<br />BUT IT!
B005LAIGYQ|4.0|The movie is about the work that the Navy SEALS do to keep our country safe from outside threats. The principle actors aren't actors at all, but are actual Navy SEALS. I think that gives it a sense of realism that can't be faked by actors who do a week or two at boot camp as research. I heard about the criticism beforehand by those who thought the acting was horrible, but I didn't find it distracting at all. I am used to watching Hollywood actors and THEY can't act, so compared to that, I thought these guys held their own pretty well. :)<br /><br />There were several different plots that highlighted the danger that our country constantly faces and the highly specialized work that these guys do. The film showed a lot of different angles like how these guys have real lives with real wives and kids. They SACRIFICE to do this. They aren't just killing machines. The film also showed that people get killed in really horrible ways. It didn't dwell on any of these types of things. It wasn't political and it didn't make judgments. It just showed it like it is. It's up to the viewer to draw their own conclusions. In that way, it wasn't a Hollywood flick at all- which was refreshing.<br /><br />Anyway, I am not much for war type movies or shoot 'em up action, but I appreciated being given a glimpse into the world of our nation's heroes. It's not the type of thing I'd watch again and again because it is intense, but I found it compelling.
0694013013|5.0|This is one of my daughter's favorite books (she's one and a half). She loves imitating all the movements and she learned so many new words from the book from our first read (such as \\"thump\\" from \\"I am a gorilla and I thump my chest\\"). I highly recommend it for children around her age or a little older.<br /><br />I think what makes this book so unique is the simple yet very engaging interactivity which is missing from MOST books. We read the page, look at the pictures, AND act out rather than just reading and looking at the pictures as we do with most other books.
B006R1T40I|4.0|I heard this album compared to her early \\"Home Plate,\\" and I agree. Funky and classic at the same time, somehow, and Bonnie's voice and guitar are as vital as ever. If you like Bonnie Raitt, or if you like the blues, get this cd -- you won't be sorry.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Well written with an inventive plot line Gone Girl was one of those books that can't be put down. Gillian Flynn writes car wreck characters.  You read their stories with the same morbid fascination you feel when seeing the damage wrought by a bad accident. The story's twists and turns with surprising but well thought out developments deliver a brilliant read. Initially I felt a bit of a let down with the ending.  But after thinking it over I wonder what kind of wild ride Ms. Flynn could come up with using the novel's final circumstances.  This is a very good book that delivers a great story, engaging plot, and interesting characters.  It's certainly worth your time.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is an addictive game. What I like most about it is that it is a mind teaser and helps keep my brain/mind agile.
B007VTVGAQ|3.0|I love Fiona Apple.  I really do.  She's been with me through the train - wreck that were my teen years, and on into my early 20's.  I eagerly waited for \\"Extraodinary Machine\\" and was very pleased with the album.  Now, I realise that I am just a consumer, and a small drop of water in the HUGE sea of consumers/critics, but I've got to say, \\"Idler Wheel\\" has let me down a bit.<br /><br />First of all, it is some really good song writing.  The album isn't horrible.  However, I couldn't help but cringe through some of the songs while I was listening to them.  Fiona is SO ANGRY on this release.  Yeah, she was angry before, but she at least had a somewhat tongue-in-cheek approach with her lyrics and song writing.  On this new CD, you can hear that she is literally singing thru a clenched jaw and teeth that must be cracking with each syllable she utters.  It makes for some interesting vocalisations, and, frankly, gave me TMJ just listening to it.<br /><br />Also, the songs, while creatively written, are arranged for maximum damage as well.  Sparsely instrumented with loud, crashing percussion on almost every track.  It's like she went off her meds for a while and just kicked things around the studio and had them record it.<br /><br />I get it, you're angsty, Fiona.  That's why we love you.  But, this, this is just too angry.  Even Tori Amos, on her worst day, could inject a little compassion into her lyrics.  It's hard for me to find a favourite song on this LP, and I can name a dozen off her previous 3 releases.  Perhaps, with time, I will warm to some of them, but heed my advice and don't listen to this CD while driving home in rush hour traffic.  It may make you want to punch a baby.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Nice clear work.<br />I would like to see this expanded slightly to include publishing using the Mac or Linux, both of which I use. The instructions are for those who use Word on Windows (mostly). I tend to write on my Macbook using Sigil, and push to my Kindles for testing using Calibre, both of which are freeware products that I support. It gives me a quick turnaround and rapid development. This works for me, but the book doesn't mention them. I also wish the book mentioned publishing from the .epub or .mobi formats.<br />That said, I learned a bit from this book, and I've already recommend it to others.
B007SGM084|3.0|The trilogy is writtne for women and or submissive women at that. The Dom is not a real character--excuse me--I am and he isn't. The books draw havily from sukch things as Club d'Odelesque and other such resources. NOt bad as an introduction especially for those who wiol neve go further.
B000OJFV4C|2.0|I was disappointed in the storyline. It was all over the place. Characterization not as fleshed out as I hoped.
B000JML90Y|4.0|I downloaded the \\"On the Origin of Species\\" for reading with the Kindle app on my smartphone. I was flying round trip across country and made use of the time to read this famous publication.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Of the new Doctors, #9 is my favorite. He was just the right balance of fun and angry. Rose is a perfect companion. Moffet is a genius.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|\\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: It has been eight years since Batman vanished into the night, turning, in that instant, from hero to fugitive. Assuming the blame for the death of D.A. Harvey Dent, the Dark Knight sacrificed everything for what he and Commissioner Gordon both hoped was the greater good. For a time the lie worked, as criminal activity in Gotham City was crushed under the weight of the anti-crime Dent Act.<br /><br />But everything will change with the arrival of a cunning cat burglar with a mysterious agenda. Far more dangerous, however, is the emergence of Bane, a masked terrorist whose ruthless plans for Gotham drive Bruce out of his self-imposed exile. But even if he dons the cape and cowl again, Batman may be no match for Bane.<br /><br />The cast led by Christian Bale (as Bruce Wayne / Batman), Michael Caine (as Alfred), Gary Oldman (as Commissioner Jim Gordon), Anne Hathaway (as Selina Kyle / Catwoman), Tom Hardy (as Bane), Marion Cotillard (as Miranda Tate), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (as John Blake) & Morgan Freeman (as Lucius Fox) is brilliant. The directing by Christopher Nolan (who also produced) is brilliant. The story (based on Bob Kane's comic books) by Nolan & David S. Goyer & the screenplay by Nolan & his brother, Jonathan, is brilliant.<br /><br />The music by Hans Zimmer is brilliant. The cinematography by Wally Pfister is brilliant. The film editing by Lee Smith is brilliant. The casting by John Papsidera is brilliant. The production design by Nathan Crowley & Kevin Kavanaugh is brilliant. The art direction by Toby Britton, Kate Grimble, Zack Grobler, James Hambidge, Naaman Marshall, Jonathan Kevin Ong, Tom Still, Gerald Sullivan, Su Whitaker, Dean Wolcott & Robert Woodruff is brilliant. The set decoration by Paki Smith, set dressings by Ted Altman, Scott Edward Collins, Brendon Crigler, Jeno Dellicolli, Sean Doyle, Sean Haines, Jim Heastings, Brock Helfer, Linda Herrera, Scott G. Jones, Jason McDonough,Zach Selter, Randy Severino, Matt Stonish, Marisa Umsawasdi, Michael Vojvoda, John Warner, James Whelan, Robert Greenfield & Chris Withrow, set designs by Jason Kolowski & Emily Kwong is brilliant. The costume design by Lindy Hemming is brilliant. The stunts coordinated by Tom Struthers, Sy Hollands, George Cottle & Monique Allen, fights arranged by Buster Reeves is brilliant. The make-up by Audrey Doyle, Doug Fairall, Jay Wejebe, Maggie Elliott & Conor O'Sullivan is brilliant. The special effects supervised by Chris Corbould & coordinated by Jeff Brink & Scott R. Fisher is brilliant. The special make-up effects designed by Diana Choi is brilliant. The visual effects supervised by Paul J. Franklin, Pete Bebb, Rob Hodgson, Andrew Lockley & coordinated by Beverly Abbott, Katy Mummery, Max Rees, Katie Stetson, Jeff Winkle & Leanne Young is brilliant.<br /><br />This is a brilliantly well-made finale that is entertaining and well-crafted. This is also an impressive film, visually and thematically. This is just as brilliant as \\"Batman Begins\\" & \\"The Dark Knight\\". This is another terrific film from Christopher Nolan. This is also one of the best films of the summer season and of the year, so far.
0345803507|5.0|Was a slow start for me but once it picked up then it was a fast read. Didn't want to put the book down till I read Tue whole thing.
B0050XFY4O|4.0|This movie is absolutely gorgeous. Very highly recommended for anyone with an open mind.<br /><br />I'll admit that it's true this film is light on conflict and leaves some aspects unexplored. For example, it sort of glosses over why the boys got into the fight at school that caused a pretty serious injury. Was it because other kids at school were uncomfortable with their closeness? That's one of many parts that I wish they had expanded on. However, the lack of detailed plotting is made up for with gorgeous cinematography, beautiful theme music, and lots of long quiet sequences full of the most passionate embracing I've ever seen on film.<br /><br />As other people have pointed out, the actors are completely believable while portraying this deep lifelong love. I was even impressed with the child actors, whose casual touches and adoring gazes and gentle caresses were perfect mirrors of the mannerisms the older actors later possessed.<br /><br />The scene that begins at the 43:22 mark is one of my favorite scenes in movie history. Not many movies successfully pull off declarations of love without being too cliche or cloying. To me, the scene of them in bed asking each other \\"Why do you love me?\\" was a perfect mix of tender, playful, and philosophical. It highlights the extremely codependent nature of their relationship without making it seem unhealthy. They give each other exactly what they need, and they don't care that no one else would understand it. Fascinating dynamic. Powerfully moving.<br /><br />If I had to summarize this film in a few words, I would say: Lovely, erotic, sweet, and memorable.
0345803493|5.0|Slow starting; but once into book then didnt take long to finish. Couldn't wait to start the last book in series.
B006LSZECO|4.0|When I started reading this book, I was ready to put it down knowing the author was giving you small clues to the crime. Well, was I in for a shock and I will say that many others who read this book (maybe not married people) will find it an eye opener to the institution of marriage and the misconception of married people who stay married for the sake of being married. I applaud the author for bringing to light the realization that--and I quote from a famous line in a movie...&#34;Marriage is an institution whos time has come and GONE.&#34; Those who complain about the lame ending fail to realize that's marriage in its ttrue sense.
0345803485|4.0|Was a slow read to start but by chapter 4 then it starts to pick up.couldn't wait to finish it so I could read the others in series.
B001FFBI82|5.0|I really love jarhead i watch it alot best war movie ever i guess i like it cause i am joining the marines soon
B007H9B6KA|5.0|This album is a beast. Garbage been gone for awhile so I patently waited, and it was worth it. Not Your Kind Of People is just as good as any album this band has release. Shirley's vocals are haunting and Rockish, the bands music is also great, no song sounds the same as well a great mixture of rock and some popish sounds makes the album more thorough. My faves so far are sugar, control, i hate love, and felt.This album is well worth owning.
0345529057|5.0|I am loving these books. Very well written. Good service, fast delivery. I'm not an avid reader but these books caught my attention from the first page.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it was nice to find a many-in-one game,  but I also found it hard to unlock them. it starts with 8 or 9 games pre- unlocked but then you have to &quot;buy &quot; games with points you earn. I don't know,  but I found it hard at some points.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This book has some meat to it.  It keeps you wondering, and just when you think one problem has been solved, another pops up.  An they're the type of crises that keep you reading.  Keeping the book near is essential.

0374275637|5.0|Summary: A definite recommendation. Explore our mind, how we make choices and how we make faults. How common sense is not really common and how our mind fails us in the process.<br /><br />A rather tome-like book, I was introduced to Kahneman when I started reading a blog by David McRaney called you are not so smart. He explores biases and heuristics such as anchoring, availability bias, sunk cost fallacy, and the like. These of course are bulk of Kahneman's work thus his name appears frequently in his blog. Another common name in the blog is Richard Thaler who has an awesome book as well called Nudge who Kahneman has worked with.<br /><br />Kahneman's goal with the book, as stated in the introduction, is to open a lay man's mind in others decisions in situations, changes in policy and other topics that are usually discussed around the water cooler. A very simple goal if you ask me, but very relevant and timely as we \\"know\\" more about our friends from social media more than anytime in the world. He aims to give us tools to discuss situations in an informed way and to know why certain decisions seem very irrational and yet people still make the mistake of doing it.<br /><br />Thinking, fast and slow (TFS) is divided into five parts starting with our \\"two systems\\". A part of the book which will be referenced several times as it is the basis on how a lot of us think and process situations. Aptly named System One and System Two, this is a simplification of our thought process. System One is our \\"gut\\", the part of our brain that decides fast and assesses the situation with lightning speed. System Two is our \\"thinking self\\" the one that we use when we take time to process situations. When we stop and think, when we multiply 12 by 46. These two systems guide us everyday and make us do what we do. The use of these two systems for me defines a person. Impulsive versus reflective, an analyzer versus a quick doer.<br /><br />The first section of the book already introduces priming. Where decisions and situations are influenced by the outside environments by priming our System One. Priming is setting up the environment or situation to influence the decision of another to our favor. Whenever you walk into a shop, observe the environment. Everything is there for a reason, which is for you to purchase something. Making it easy for you to make a decision so that you don't need to engage your lazy System Two and letting System One take care of the rest. Several examples are in the book of which most of us can definitely relate to.<br /><br />Section two of TFS talks about heuristics and biases and for me was the most interesting section. These are common misconceptions that us lazy humans make sense of in our attempt to understand the world we are living in. Sadly, these pitfalls in our human minds are so hard to detect and figure out for ourselves as we are in the middle of the situation, compared to when we are observing a third party that is falling to the \\"trap\\". Common examples such as anchoring, having a base number over a purchase influences us that there is a discount. Availability bias that limits our decisions to what is only available to our feeble minds. One of my favorites is regression to the mean where we think that there is no where to go but up or a hot streak in basketball is really a \\"streak\\". I really hate our dumb minds.<br /><br />Section three introduces more biases as it's named Overconfidence. Hindsight bias the act of looking back and saying \\"I told you so\\" and outcome bias are both common in the working world and I was glad to have learned it in this book. Another interesting chapter is our reliance on experts and how, if we should, evaluate experts. Feedback and experience are the two key words here.<br /><br />The fourth section talks about choices. This is where bulk of Kahneman's work really shines where he also discuss about his work that earned him the Nobel Prize for Economics. My hatred for understanding mathconcepts came out but I appreciated the whole section as it again shows our poor understanding of ourselves especially in making decisions. What situations make a person more risk or loss averse. When do we get more value out of our money and how we view gains and losses. How much we value our things through the \\"endowment effect\\". Loss aversion, possibility effects and others make this section another must read (which I will actually re-read soon) as it shows how much we value things either monetary or otherwise. Another chapter of this section talks about rare events, such as getting struck by lightning and the like. How we overweigh and overestimate things. How vivid stories and images add weight to situations and \\"rare events\\". My dabbling with statistics already gave me the tools not to overweigh things but it's great to see it from another angle. How come we're more afraid of shark attacks than driving even though our chances of dying to the latter is much more?<br /><br />The fourth section for me had the most meat and shows how much research has Kahneman put on the topics in the section. My mind was opened with several situations presented in each of the chapters in the section. I have to admit that I fall for most of the situations in this section as my System Two for mathematical situation and analysis is very lazy. Risk and loss aversion, framing losses, disposition effect and other situations where gains and loss has to be calculated is definitely something that I have to improve on. A re-read and a better understanding will definitely allow me to take a step back and see the bigger picture of gains and losses.<br /><br />The book ends with Two Selves. Our mind is very strange especially on how we see experiences and memories. How we focus on the wrong things and want others. How happiness is perceived and how we strive to achieve it. This chapter is a great end to the book as it analyzes our situation as a whole. How we humans look at ourselves and howwe experience, remember and reflect on our own existence and happiness. A great end to a great book.<br /><br />Thinking, fast and slow gets all praises for me as I enjoy reading books that look into the mind. The best thing about Kahneman's book is it's really based on research and not just chewed up and regurgitated paper like a Malcolm Gladwell book. I was a fan of him until I read Blink and realized how much that book wasted my time with his premise going round and round. I realized that he is a great writer and nothing more.<br /><br />Thinking, fast and slow is an easy read and a great introduction to the world of our mind. A world full of contradictions and biases. A mind full of assumptions and what ifs. If you want to understand others and ourselves, do pick this up. Thank you Mr. Kahneman and Mr. Tversky.
B0086700CM|5.0|Omg...I cant believe how addicting this game is I have seriously been sitting here on the couch playing it for like hours.....I love this game.....if u haven't gotten this game yet u need to download it right now!!!!!
B007KZY1YY|5.0|Cannot get enough of Christian, as frustrating as he is!  This series is addictive and you just want to see what happens next. Some parts of this book are really quite thrilling!
B00881VLCE|5.0|this game is fantastic...so fantastic that I have already done all of the puzzles...highly recommended for people who enjoy puzzles...overall a great game
B007L3BMGA|4.0|This book starts of rather poorly.  However if you can overlook that it does get better as it goes.  You cannot fully appreciate Fifty Shades of Grey without continuing with the series.  All three books combine to make quite a highly-addictive and romantic story of two people stumbling through life who find themselves together.  It is not just 'mommy porn'!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is soooooo addictive and fun!! if u like to play games that make u think and r soooooo entertaining this is the game for u!!!! I love this game....definitely a must-have game!!!!
B007KOYEOC|5.0|This is my favourite of the three books in the series.  The conclusion to Christian's journey is truly heartening.  I love this story, my only problem being that there is not any more to read...
B0063IH60K|5.0|this game is so fun....its a classic that works really well on my kindle...highly recommended and very fun to play when u are bored
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|It is superior to office tools for the mobility, and as versatile as I could wish for in an app for writing the never-timely ramblings of my mind...
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|sooooooo fun!!! I can sit for hours and hours until my battery runs out and play back and forth with friends and family!!! if u haven't gotten this app yet u seriously need to stop reading the reviews and go back up to the top of the page and download it right now....definitely a must-have app!!!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I'll keep it short so as not to rant.<br /><br />*Spoilers below*<br /><br />Was it very predictable? Sure - At least until the part before she offs Coin(based off her friends in high places, this shouldn't have seemed like such a big deal, she definitely did the whole world a favor). For the whole book I thought that the final scene was gonna be to take back District 13(after taking the Capitol)...so I just felt like at the 75% point in the book we really shoulda been more around 2/3 of the way through. Bad pacing, poor conclusion...but the epilogue redeems it for me. As soon as you read that hospital scene between Peeta and Katniss you know that they have to get married and if they hadn't I might have lost it.<br /><br />A must read.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is a great way to keep the brain sharp.  It is totally addicting!  I can't get enough of it!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I know how it sounds, \\"Most fun book of the series\\"?...tricking the people, trying to avoid a revolution, trapped in a an arena fighting for your life. This is the most \\"fun\\" book in the series. Because of what Collin's builds in the first book you never think that the characters are in actual danger. You're along for the ride and you're more wrapped up in Peeta and Katniss' love story to care what else happens.
B005KELW26|5.0|Even though this case is for Amazon Kindle Fire, This fits perfectly for my Nexus 7.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- All buttons/ports are accessible.<br />- Heavy duty material.<br />- Uses a pullover strap to keep closed. Much better than a clasp.<br />- Folds into a stand for easy movie watching.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Blocks the rear speaker. Sound is muffled but can still be heard (Can't really complain much since it wasn't make for Nexus 7)<br /><br />I really can't recommend this enough. Whether it's for the Kindle Fire, Nexus 7, or any 7in tablet, this is the one to get.
B002DQLGHU|5.0|The start, #1, of the Potter saga is my favorite.  I wanted the Blu Ray edition so I could watch it in the best quality.  This movie is great and so is the quality.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Action packed movie.  Kept you in your seat for the almost 3-hour movie.  Exciting and the best Dark Knight movie yet.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Ok, some of the erotic description warmed me up. However, after a while it becomes redundant. The story, at times, is interesting, but this book should not be on the best seller list. I had never heard of the 50 Shades trilogy until it was a subject on Dr Oz. then I heard the books were banned by some libraries. After that, I had to read them. Doubt I'll read the third book.
B0034G4P8A|4.0|The Thor movie was not memorable as Iron Man but enjoyable nonetheless.  The movie rolled on at a much slower pace and did seem like it was divided into too many parts and transitions between them were not very smooth.  Plot was ok but I did enjoy the fight scenes when they existed. I liked Natalie Portman and her scientist buddies. The main battle was very disappointing, but I did enjoy the little glimpse of Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye and the rest of the S.H.I.E.L.D crew.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wow, I love the concept, original and makes for a great story. Characters are well thought and the story is engaging. Great detail and the ending  leaves you wanting more.
B006P0FICE|1.0|I have read The Three Musketeers by Alexandre Dumas and have seen many of the movie versions.  This is by far one of the worst movies based on Dumas' work right next to The Musketeer.  While Matthew Macfadyen did a good job of being Athos and Luke Evans was ok as Aramis, there was so much of the characterizations necessary to create Athos, Aramis, Porthos and D'Artagnan which was missing.  Where was the womanizing Aramis (except in the opening scene)?  The worst casting by far was D'Artagnan.  From the messed up hair, to poor acting Logan Lerman could not even attempt to pull off the arrogant Gascon.  And Milla Jovovich as M'Lady de Winter and Orlando Bloom as Buckingham were horrid!<br /><br />But despite the miscasting I still gave the movie a try only to watch it revolve around flying ships...  No plot, horrible casting, and bad acting makes me wonder why this even made it onto a movie screen in the first place.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Bought the triogly as a gift because I read the books on my ipad. Purchase was fast and very easy. Shipping was excellent.  Great all the way around.
B00365C752|5.0|If you've been watching Season 1 from the beginning, you know that they have a favorite plot so far--\\"NEIL, we're going to have you go undercover as a rich investor...\\"  This episode was totally different.<br /><br />There was also a little twist in how the case wrapped up, and I thought it was clever.<br /><br />I really liked this episode.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|you will enjoy it. I first played it and thought that it would be dumb. but it turns out that its very fun... give  it a shoot and see for yourself.
044655667X|4.0|If you're one who is into nicely detailed courtroom dramas you'll be intrigued by Mr. Connelly's novel. If not, the book may not be for you.<br /><br />We have a banker, Mitch Bondurant, murdered. The defendant Lisa Trammel is defended by our protagonist Mike Haller. Haller doesn't like his client at all, yet gives her defense his all.<br />The detailed courtroom drama is well done, yet not boring. Others characters are introduced as the story moves along. Some may be viable suspects in the murder. The characters are developed very well.<br /><br />Mike Haller balances the tight drama with a less than stellar personal life with his daughter and ex-wife.<br />The ending of this work has a couple of very good twists in it and we have Haller learning a lesson in life.<br /><br />A little bit too long in length, I felt some areas in court could have been pared down. I still found it a page turner. Nicely done, Mr. Connelly.
B007LE2VDM|5.0|I have been a huge fan ever since I first heard \\"Jar of Hearts.\\"  I kept thinking, let's see if she has any more singles 'cuz I might want the whole CD.  Turned out I DID want the CD.  She has a great voice and I love every song I have listened to.
B0086700CM|4.0|its a nice game even though it doesn't change levels I still like it I think everybody should get it
0425263908|5.0|Eva and Gideon's story is complicated and complexed.  I could not put my ereader down.  This was a page turner with me wanted to find out what's on the next page.  Sylvia Day's writing is a thriller of two people bared to each other for REAL.  Great read, can't wait for the next book to see what happend to 2 of my favorite characters.  Did I say GREAT READ!!
B00881VLCE|3.0|I found the puzzle difficult to  navigate.<br /><br />Keep it simple and I would enjoy it a lot more.<br /><br />The graphics are very good.
B007SGM084|4.0|Although you could tell that this was the first book she's ever written, the story more than made up for it. I couldn't put it down. I feel in love with the characters, and almost learned as much as Anastasia myself!
B001NKI60W|5.0|Yes, it's a chick flick--and no, I'm not a chick--but this is a really nice movie. It was written to showcase the music of ABBA, and it does, which makes the sound track alone worth the price of the rental. Going to purchase the disk to add to my library!
B000002MUN|4.0|I listen to this when I write, and come up with the best stories. I listen to this while I work on my headphones,and the day goes by so fast, I listen to this when I am blue and it heals me.<br /><br />Some of the songs are serious rock n' roll, but others are little pieces of philosophy. from \\" you don't know how it feels \\" - people come, people go , some grow young some grow cold. And \\"from time to move on\\" - broken skyline which way to Love Land ? Which way to forgiveness ? Which way do I go ?  The guitar riffs in between the lyrics of  'don't fade on me ' are right up there with pink floyd's master guitar solos.<br /><br />Also my one friend who is this tough cynical person, heard wildflowers and sang along  in this childlike voice ,like it took her back to a happy place before all the bad happened.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This Bible app is awesome! If u wanna study a passage in another version it's so quick and easy to switch back and forth! I would recommend to anyone!
B004V2AWKG|4.0|This book is really interesting. It was an assigned book during the course that I took in summer. I when I first start reading the book it was kid of boring, but later the events attracted me to read it. Sometimes I read this book on the train while I am going to my class. One day I was almost miss my stop because this book made me live in its story.<br />Especially, the part when Jonas had discovered the truth about the release, and had seen his father had released new child. However, the end is still confusing.I am thinking to read this book one or maybe two more time, for I Enjoyed reading it. I wondered why some authorities are frightened from keeping this book available for schools.
B005OCFHHK|1.0|My copy was missing the film Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.  I have no idea what to do about it.
B007SGM084|1.0|I bought this trilogy to read while on vacation, thinking that it might be a fun read to enjoy on the trip.  I should have saved my money and gone to see the world's biggest ball of twine or something equally entertaining.<br /><br />Written by someone who doesn't seem to have a grasp of American colloquialisms, it has adolescent dialogue, poorly developed characters, a 21-year-old naïve virgin who becomes a multiorgasmic sex goddess, and a billionaire control freak who likes beating the s**t out of women and marginalizing them as being nuts and not worthy of \\"more.\\"  Never mind his whopping case of Stockholm syndrome that is pervasive throughout all three books.<br /><br />And frankly, I got tired of all the sex scenes.  When I started the third book, and it was a rehash of the first two, I skipped ahead to see how things ended.  It was totally and completely unbelievable.<br /><br />Dear mommies seeking porn:  Do yourself a favor.  Put the kids down for a nap, and search for free porn on the internet.  It's much cheaper and there's better variety.
0545128285|4.0|Beedle the bard is an awesome collection of stories that are eluded to in the books. Its cute to be able to read it in its entirety. I loved the comments dumbledore left about how some of the stories had been lobbied against and some had attempted to ban them.<br /><br />If you're looking for off kilter stories go here.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Simply Amazing! Everyone should watch The Dark Knight at lest once in their Life time! its a masterpiece. Christopher Nolan gives us the best Batman movie to date. With an amazing performance by Heath \\" The Joker\\"

B008645YEE|4.0|Epic conclusion to the Nolan series!! Hans Zimmer gives us once again a very powerful album! however it does lack the touch of James Newton Howard. Never the less its a very good composed OST but it could have been perfect, But of the three in my opinion this album finish second.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Five books long yet holds attention until the very end!<br /> The only disappointment was the ending,obviously a sixth book is in the future, to tie up all the lose ends! I hope it will be soon,the plot deals with so many people to keep up with you are left with the thought \\"What Happens Now\\" Please George R. R. Martin<br />don't leave us hanging!!!!

B008JGSM6G|5.0|Freaking awesome pure epicness is the only way to say it is a good game just get it plus its free!!!!!
0061692042|2.0|I'm halfway through \\"Canada\\" and was hoping a couple of glowing reviews would give me incentive to keep going.  So far, I am stunned by the excess of this book.  Not its prose, which is plain and unmusical -- but the sheer quantity of it.  Does Ford's publisher pay him by the word?  I have rarely encountered this degree of small- and large-scale repetition in a straight-ahead novel.  Nor can I abide the constant use of elbow-in-the-ribs foreshadowing to \\"lure\\" the reader through a story that moves at the pace of a narcotized snail.  Half the myriad brief chapters end with some form of, \\"Had I known then what I know now...\\"<br /><br />The glowing reviews here are from people with different sensibilities, and it's wonderful that they enjoyed the experience as much as they did.  But I'm outta here; life is too short.
0767847431|5.0|Love this movie the most of all the Sinbad epics. John Philip Law will always be Sinbad for me. The Harryhausen animation is still so cool. The battle with the statue of Kali is amazing!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I was just planning on playing for a few minutes, but it turned into an hour! if I were u I would get it. plus, its free! I would still pay 99&cent; if I had to:)
0143038583|5.0|This is one of my favorite all-time books. I love food, I'm curious, I want to eat healthy and responsibly. This is the best possible summation of our food system and it's history that I could imagine. He seems genuinely curious and open minded. A classic.
030758836X|2.0|I felt this was a story of a GenX couple, and what might happen as they age in a world that doesn't value everything one does. It's really not a suspense thriller, but a case study in privilege, disappointment, and revenge for having to live in a real world where one's every move is not celebrated. Although I liked the juxtaposition of the characters narratives, I was never surprised by or involved in the characters. They were portrayed as two thirty-something spoiled children who ended up with no consequences to their actions.
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|I declared R&B dead until I heard R, Kelly's Write Me Back. After hearing Frank Ocean's Channel Orange, I have hope that real R&B will return to the forefront. This album is simply amazing. My Favorite songs are Pink Matter, Super Rich Kids, Bad Religion and Sweet Life. Support this man!!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|for an action game its one of the better free games I have played on my kindle fire I give it five stars for action, replay ability, and goals

B007SYWFRM|5.0|Keeps the kids busy in the car. Only problem is they fight over who getter to play the game first. Glad we downloaded it.
B0068PHS5Q|3.0|I am ploughing my way through this book. After reading the reviews I thought this would be a book I would like as I love Victorian novels. I find the over worked description is irritating and the plot line and characters uninteresting. As an airport novel it's OK. I'm sorry I wasted my money!
0756405890|5.0|Anytime you get a book with 1,000+ reviews and its average number of stars is 4.5 it must me good and must create a loyalty among the readers. I can say this book had that effect on me and everyone I had the pleasure of recommending it to.<br /><br />What this book really does well is what it doesn't do. This book does not fit the \\"popcorn\\", \\"beach\\"  reads of summer, yet brings the pleasure of  a beach read. Patrick Rothfuss does such a good job of description you can vanish into the world that Kvothe occupies. Many easy read books are predictable in how they turn out so much so that you know the end well before you get there, The Name of the Wind is not one of these books. This book gives you reason to continue reading. I look at it almost like a more adult form of Harry Potter or the Hunger Games (both of which I am a fan).<br /><br />The magic and the university have a real feeling to them, the magic appears to be almost \\"knowledge\\" in an era when the majority of the population was illiterate. I found it believable in the context of the story. I especially liked the reality of the mistakes Kvothe makes from his impulsive and often selfish behavior along with the results of these mistakes. Patrick Rothfuss gives us a hero with faults and I believe that is what drives the story. A main character who is heroic to the point of cockiness This cockiness is the root of his mistakes and his mistakes create considerable difficulties for him. Thus the story is able to unfold in multiple pages that hold your interest to the point you cannot put the book down until you reach the end; only to grab for the second book because you just cannot get enough of the story of Kvothe.<br /><br />Highly recommend this book, I really wish the third book would come out soon.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|One of the first things I did when I got my kindle fire was get this Bible app. The fact that it was free was great but then I found out about all the plans, I was amazed! I am very happy with this app!
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I'm glad I started this book on a Friday night because I ended up reading it all day on Saturday.  Although I felt the last third of the book was not as strong as the beginning, I plan on reading the sequel.  I wonder what other photographs (and corresponding peculiar characters) Ransom Riggs will introduce to us!<br /><br />I read the Kindle version of this book (via my library's eBook lending library) and agree that the pictures and handwritten letters were difficult to view on my Kindle Keyboard.

0307730697|5.0|You need to read this book. You need to know what our brave Warriors in the United States Military are doing for us. You need to know what these people and their families sacrifice for our freedom.<br />Very few books have affected me the way this one has. \\"Lone Survivor\\" was the closest.<br />When I started this book I didn't like Adam and what he was doing to his friends, Girlfriend(then wife), and family. I couldn't believe I was reading this.<br />By the end of the book I was in tears, praying to God, and thanking God for everything he has given me and my family. I was also praying for Adam's family.<br />I can't recommend this book enough.<br />Thank you to all our Service men and women out there.<br />God Bless the United States of America.

0446572993|5.0|I got hooked on David Baldacci's books from the very first one. This book is one of his best(Until the next one come out)and pulls you in from the begining and holds you until the end. Keep writting Dave.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The first book was a bit raw for me to swallow. No pun intended. Now the second book is developing into a love story and it is a nonstop read for me. I can only imagine who will play Christian in the movie. Laters baby. Gotta love it!

B005LAIGLE|3.0|The movie Contraband was not very thrilling. Mark Wahlberg and Giovanni Ribisi are great actors but \\"something\\" was missing in this movie.<br />Yes, I love thrillers and know \\"most\\" are unrealistic BUT this movie was regrettably unrealistic.<br />The punk brother in law (you want to pull him out of the screen and smack him he is so annoying)? The Panama City connection? The double crossing best friend?<br />Had a hard time believing in the characters and the plot.<br />I would like to see the Icelandic movie this is based from .......and see how badly or not it was lost in translation.

145162445X|2.0|I am disappointed I bought this book. Most of the book is about physics and the history of physics. Its not worth buying.

B007P4OTHO|5.0|this is my first review here or anywhere. Seeing some people make comments about this just being \\"another me too remaster\\" prompted me. In short, the sound of this new vinyl is superb in every way, shape and form and if this remaster isn't from the original analog tapes as claimed then it's from insanely good high-res digital because the sound just out of this world. I own an original 1st press UK vinyl pressing of this record which to this point was the best I'd every heard Ziggy sound by far. Unlike the Mo-Fi, which takes a lot of liberties, this new remaster sounds tonally very much like the original, only better in nearly all ways. The instruments have greater clarity, you can hear every drum skin in the kit, and the dynamics are far better. Bowie's vocal is a bit more \\"there\\" on the original, but everything else sounds better on this new vinyl. A lot better. And while there's more detail, it's very warm, natural and analog-like. In short it's a great great LP and anyone who wants the best sounding Ziggy vinyl there is without shelling out over $100 for a UK original should snap it up- and even then I'd argue this new pressing is better in almost every way. in short, don't pay attention to the haters, this new vinyl is the bee's knees!
B008M4MB8K|5.0|30th Anniversary Edition Blu-Ray Review:<br /><br />Having seen this movie probably more times and in more different formats than most, I thought it was time I write a few words about this masterpiece of filmmaking. Truly, I wasn't boasting with my assertion that I've seen this movie as much as I have (I watch this movie almost once a week and have done so for well over 10 years). I own several, still unopened, VHS tapes that for a large part of the nineties I did my best at collecting. I own the Japanese Laserdisc version, a rare bootleg VHS version that was distributed over the internet a handful of years ago that has the narration selectively placed back into the Director's Cut version of the film, not called the Esper Version as some would want to label it, the Director's Cut and now the HD version of the Final Cut. Blade Runner is just one of those movies that *consistently* holds up to numerous viewings and is never dull. Only the finest films seem to have this quality.<br /><br />Blade Runner first and foremost, is probably the greatest film ever made, from beginning to end and in all of its variations. A bold statement when the film doesn't even rank in the top 10 in the American Film Institute or on IMDb. Spots #97 and #104 respectively (ahem). But as these kind of lists are subjective and truly under the control of mere mortals and their own strange whims, and I take no offense that so many so-called aficionados have over-looked this film for so long. Roger Ebert slammed Ridley Scott and the film during the first theatrical release by stating that 'Scott cared more about the lush environment of the film than he did of the story', which as we all know - and even Ebert now, in hindsight, has stated that he was unkind and grossly unfair to both Scott and the film. We saw this same knee-jerk reaction to something mentally and emotionally foreign happen again with Prometheus, but that's another tale, but not unexpected.<br /><br />For years, Blade Runner was divided into two different camps, or rather four and they are: Those that preferred the narration and those that did not. The other camp were those that thought Deckard was a Replicant and those that thought he was either human or felt it was left ambiguous. Ridley Scott has very gracefully over the years, given homage to these thoughts and made many statements that most readers are aware of, chiefly - that Deckard was a Replicant. Unfortunately, the studios messed with the film during post-production in a very ham-handed manner. Warner Brothers had the right to trim anything after the 120 min mark, and thus butchering the nuance of the film and leaving several things vague and forcing Scott to tack on the 'happy ending' and the narration - because as we all know ... we're all just too stupid to get it. The Unicorn sequence and several other moments in the film were made to direct our attention down one path, but that path was obscured. Hampton Fancher, bless him, was one of those people who rejected the idea of Deckard being a Replicant. But that's okay, everyone has the right to their own interpretation. Philip K. Dick, however, was a little less fuzzy about it though. Deckard *was* a Replicant, and he had stated as much.<br /><br />The new and most refreshing part of the new argument, evinced in the 210 (wow!) min documentary 'Dangerous Days' is that Scott gives equal time to those that enjoyed the film with the narration, with Guillermo del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth / Hellboy) in the forefront, with his very candid telling of how Blade Runner changed his life and launched him down the road into filmmaking. We also get to hear a very lucid and warm retelling from Harrison Ford, and the nightmare that he not only endured making the movie but the further commitment of having to do the Voice Over narration months later. That ended up having its own strange story as well. We never really get to discover who that person was who wrote the Voice Over narration, because it *wasn't* David Peoples and it *wasn't* Hampton Fancher.<br /><br />This newer version (2012) comes equipped with over a thousand still photos, a spinner car model and a 72 page booklet (or digibook). I've also read, elsewhere, that it comes with a lenticular film cell but I think they should've also included one of the many versions of the soundtrack that's available as well. Some of die-hard fans would've preferred that . There's honestly not much in difference from the 2007 Final Cut release, which honestly, should've been the final release. Ultra-violet copy? I guess. But I prefer the actual disc so I can see this thing without hour-glassing, or visual generation loss from streaming. Yes, here comes the arguments in favor of Ultra-Violet.<br /><br />The 2012 Packaging with the Unicorn on the front: I think we can safely surmise that this is, once again, Ridley Scott underlining his position about Deckard. Of all the many elements to call attention to or feature on the cover, this one here is probably the most emblematic in regards 'who made who.' After all, if you know enough about this film, you already are aware that the only humans in this film were Sebastian, Holden, Gaff, Chew and Bryant. Every one else -- Replicants. Eldon Tyrell -- Replicant.<br /><br />But for the record -- there has been no adjustment made to the previous release of The Final Cut from 2007 in terms of the feature film itself. None. New menu? Maybe, but that doesn't affect the film. The film itself is the same. Why Amazon is allowing a whole new set of reviews for this product is beyond me. They should grouped them with the last set.<br /><br />So, now with several versions available in this box set, and with several others, you get to see Blade Runner in every single angle imaginable and it is engrossing every time. Ebert also said in the Nineties that the re-release of the movie for the Director's Cut gives you yet another version of the film, but fails to handle the main problems that were so apparent the first time around. As the film has changed, Ebert has gone from student flippancy to utmost respect and enjoyment. Ebert's own site has all three versions of his reviews which are interesting to read in context to the passage of time if you're interested. I'm doubting he'll review the film again, as nothing with the film itself has changed for the 2012 release.<br /><br />There are so many layers to Blade Runner and so many things that can be said from the brilliant look of the newly restored cut, the awesome remixed sound, the Original Score by Vangelis, and the story itself. Blade Runner is probably the high water mark of all films and will probably stay that way for quite some time. Internet voting puts the film as the 4th greatest movie of all time, according to AFI's own user polls - so that really puts perspective on AFI's and IMDb's so-called Final Lists. There's even a restored scene where they had lost the negative and had to reshoot it. Yes, they rebuilt the set and put everything back as it was. Harrison Ford's son was the same age when they did this and almost a dead ringer for his dad and was used as a stand in. The scene where Deckard confronts the snake seller and we see him pull him forward by his tie -- that's actually his son, Ben Ford, doing the man-handling.<br /><br />The funny thing is about this film, and it strikes me every time when I watch it -- usually when I hear that 'Ladd Comapny Logo' sound -- is that there isn't another film like this or even close to it that has come out since this was in the theatres. It's singular in many ways, even in its own duplicitous nature. Wim Wender's 'Until The End of The World' does have a sort of kin-ship with this, but it has a different feel and completely different message. I think it may be 'equally bold' though. So, the absence of anything similar is really a testament to how good it really is. A lot of folks bring up 'Children of Men' and the nuance of that film, which was brilliant. But an equal? I don't know.<br /><br />All I can really do is thank Ridley Scott for so much bloody effort, the sacrifice of years and such a true masterpiece; but I doubt he's even aware of how much I've gotten from Blade Runner or even who I am. His answer to fans is to just keep making more films. Of that, I'm thankful and will keep watching this for years to come.<br /><br />My son, who's now 5, has already seen this countless times and knows what it is when it comes on. Will he ever do 'Blade Runner' Sundays, like we did at the house with Casablanca for 12 plus years? Don't know, but it would cool if he does. I was told by the wife that I could only watch this on days when she was at work, which was fine.<br /><br />On a final note, when people watch this film, a lot of people come away with a strange feeling of familiarity regarding the content, the story and the character of Rick Deckard the protagonist, the Detective, the Blade Runner. You should know that Philip K. Dick was an incredibly huge fan of Raymond Chandler and absorbed every one of his stories on a personal level. Hampton Fancher, the screenwriter was privy to this when he penned the screenplay while making the adaptation for 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?' and did his best to not only pay homage to this for Dick but for Chandler as well. Hampton Fancher stated that he actually wrote the screenplay with Robert Mitchum in mind for the part of Deckard. Watching films like `The Big Sleep' really bring it home and make it evident to the viewer. Chandler's 'The High Window' also seems to have a lot of interesting similarity to it as well.<br /><br />Rachael: \\"Do you like our owl?\\"<br /><br />Deckard: \\"Is it artificial?\\"<br /><br />Rachael: \\"Of course.\\"<br /><br />Deckard: \\"Must be expensive.\\"<br /><br />Rachael: \\"Very.\\"<br /><br />As a parting thought, we might think that this is actually the final release of the film, but while I was watching the 'Dangerous Days' Documentary once again, I focused in on a comment that David Peoples made.  He said that there was a four-hour version (yes, 4 hours long) that they screened when they first put the thing together. I think at some point, we'll likely see that released next.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have to give this book five stars. It's a great story with well developed characters whom I truly cared about. It's action packed and well written. And it's certainly provides food for thought.<br /><br />But ... there were times I felt the author could have moved the story along a bit faster and there were bits that seemed lacking or overlooked. Spoiler Alert! Examples: The scene with Juliette going into the water and struggling for air went on much too long. Also, after she suffered the burns there was no mention of scaring or disfigurement.<br /><br />Am I glad I read it? Definitely. Should you? Yes.
B006R8GK2Q|3.0|fun to play with the kids, but the story doesn't really add much in my opinion. Facebook isn't required as some have posted. higher rez images would almost make it worth $5, but as it is I think $2 is appropriate. Got it as the FAOTD.
0765316994|3.0|\\"Redshirts\\" is founded on a fairly clever conceit.  Anyone even vaguely familiar with the original \\"Star Trek\\" television series is surely aware of the disposable crew members who were slaughtered in sordid ways when the Enterprise visited strange, new worlds.  They were frequently ranked \\"ensign\\" and clad in red shirts.  In each episode, the viewer could reliably predict the fate of the \\"away team\\" members, often by shirt color alone.  Scalzi affectionately lampoons this and various other conventions of the sci-fi television series.<br /><br />In his novel, new crew members aboard the Universal Union flagship Intrepid recognize some alarming patterns, not the least of which is that those of their ilk don't tend to live long... or prosper (sorry!).  They slowly discern that there's a \\"Narrative\\" dictating the outcomes of their missions.  While the more senior crew members have adapted by avoiding recognition and staying off the proverbial radar, the new crew members decide to challenge the \\"Narrative\\".<br /><br />While Star Trek provides fertile ground for this type of satirical treatment, there really isn't enough substance for a novel.  The primary narrative of \\"Redshirts\\" is only 231 pages, but that's at least a third longer than necessary given the story.  The plotting is uncomplicated and straightforward despite the metafictional elements which Scalzi, to his credit, took a bit farther than expected.  Characterization, another good potential use of space, was nonexistent.  This wasn't a clever metaphor on Scalzi's part (i.e., symbolic that \\"redshirts\\" aren't fully-fleshed out characters in the series) but because, rightly or wrongly, he chose to focus on the ideas underpinning the story instead of character-building.  Additionally, the dialog was largely stilted and awkward, blatantly contrived to demonstrate Scalzi's sardonic, snarky wit.  Practically every conversation was a succession of setups and one-liners.  Admittedly, they could be funny, but the overall affect was ruined by the unnatural delivery.  It was also distracting that each quotation ended with \\"he/she/[name] said\\".  I tried to discern some clever motive for this but couldn't escape the conclusion it simply resulted from laziness.<br /><br />After the overly long principle story is finished, three codas follow.  They're short stories told in first, second, and third-person respectively concerning minor characters from \\"Redshirts\\" proper.  In these short stories, Scalzi chooses to deal with some heavier themes.  In fact, there are several powerfully written and affecting passages.<br /><br />The first coda is similar in tone to the standard narrative.  It takes a shotgun approach to humor and tries way too hard.  It's occasionally funny, but the effort's too transparent.  And, although it can be easily overlooked, the story doesn't logically flow from the earlier narrative.  That said, it does provocatively assert the need for artistic integrity.<br /><br />The final two codas are much more successful, the last near flawless.  Given the light and jocular nature of the rest of the work, the emotional punch these stories deliver is all the more jarring.  Eschewing humor entirely, the tone is much more serious as Scalzi considers life and its choices and obligations.  In the final 26 pages of the book, he suddenly and unexpectedly humanizes the story, concluding the book on an exceptionally high note.  While Scalzi deserves considerable credit for the final two codas, one can't ignore that the bulk of the work, though clever and moderately amusing, was mostly mediocre.
B00000427L|2.0|The quality of the recording is questionable - production of the disk is poor.  I was very disappointed with the recording.  I am very fond of the performer and the orchestra, however, I expected a good quality recording.
B005LAII12|5.0|For all you 1 Stars, get a grip....this is a \\"movie\\"!  You all obviously saw the trailer.  When you saw a talking Teddy Bear sitting on a couch drinking beer with a grown man, what did you THINK the rest of the humor was gonna be. The animation was incredible.  The story line, albeit predictable at times, was heart-warming.  I do agree not to take your children.  Don't blame the pencil for your failing the spelling quiz.  Do your homework the next time you want to see a movie.

B00782O7NE|5.0|I sat down this evening to watch THE ARTIST on blu-ray. First there were five previews of other films, such as IRON LADY, with blaring soundtrack, which hurt my ears, but I left the volume on my usual setting. Finally the menu arrived, with a snappy bit of music. I selected PLAY, which is what I wanted to do in the first place, and then the film began. The opening credits were fuzzy, on purpose, to simulate how silent films look on VHS. Great! Blu-ray for this? Then I noticed that the soundtrack was set on a very low volume. Checking, yes, it's supposed to be a HD-Master 5.1 soundtrack, but what little sound there is seems to be coming out of the center speaker. There have been Dolby Digital 2.0 soundtracks for silent-film DVDs with much better quality sound. Then, just as I was hunkering down really to dislike this film, here comes the magnificent opening scene with the screening of the fictional RUSSIAN AFFAIR film in a movie theater with live orchestra, followed by the vaudeville routine with the dog. The hostility between the wife and the dog is something palpable. They don't want to share the same man! I did laugh. There then unfolds a series of scenes with really impressive cinematography--and silent films above all are nothing without the cinematographer. About half an hour into the movie is an incredible side-shot of a complex stairwell, with people coming and going, all as a backdrop for a meeting between the two principals. For that scene alone, the film deserves all the honors it can get, and takes a place in film history, IMHO. Yes, I'm still a bit cranky. Sound was introduced into movies in 1927, not in 1929 as the film portrays. The target audience for a film like this will surely know this, so why bend their universe? The HOLLYWOODLAND sign above the studios tell us that this is an alternative universe. Yet the script's conflation of four tragedies on October 25, 1929--financial, marital, professional and personal--seems like piling on. As you see, I try to talk myself into disliking this film. The trouble is, I don't convince myself. Otherwise, why would I be upset that the film was not widescreen, unless I really wanted to see more of it? I think it is a great film that was over-tampered with in post-production. But then, much more drastic things of the same kind happened to GREED, FOOLISH WIVES and MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS, and yet each of them remains a masterpiece. This is a film I will have to see two or three times to know if it grows on me. At this point I think I might not want to do without it.<br />AFTER SECOND VIEWING:<br />Well, I found out after posting my review that the film had won five Oscars--\\"That's a horse on me!\\" (Tim Holt in MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS). Give me time--I may catch up with events! (Is this film about me?)  Last night I put the blu-ray in to watch a second time. This time I skipped the previews, and that helped get into the film itself, but the menu music should have been turned down to match the volume on the film itself. For the menu music to spoil the opening mood is a frequent fault of DVD and blu-ray mastering. The soundtrack didn't seem so muted this time as before, but still--if the soundtrack won an Oscar, then it is nothing to be shy about. Bring it on! The opening titles were still too fuzzy, but the intertitles within the film itself were crisp and clear. The title character is a little bit of Rudolph Valentino (the name), Douglas Fairbanks (the swashbuckling sequence), Ramon Novarro (the silent star with a foreign accent), Maurice Chevalier (a French accent) and Fred Astaire (the dance routine--very well done). The female lead is closest, I think, to Clara Bow's in WINGS. During the late Twenties, films were featuring fallen women or liberated women, and even Clara Bow had a scene in WINGS where she impersonated a fallen women. But the female lead in THE ARTIST is a \\"good person\\" as the butler says. She avoids all their character flaws while combining the awestruck fan, the ambitious understudy, etc. She avoids every clich&eacute; and is always a real person at every stage of the film. Her one lapse is talking silly in an interview, but that is certainly an easy temptation to fall into. Even career politicians put their feet into their mouths often enough. I do not consider her having \\"toy boys\\" around her a character lapse, since she labels it herself. They are caricatures, but she is not.<br />About the widescreen issue. There were experiments with widescreen in the late Twenties and early Thirties. One concluding reel of Abel Gance's NAPOLEON (1927) is split-screen, a triptych of images. BAT WHISPERS (1932) was released in both standard and Magnoscope versions. I tried streching THE ARTIST out to the width of my TV, and it worked well nearly all of the time. I felt that it enhanced the effect of the film, except when it chopped off people's foreheads or feet. I hate that sort of thing, so I won't try it again.<br />So I am sorry that the award-winning soundtrack and award-winning cinematography are kept muted, but the film won the top awards anyway, so who am I to complain? Only two silent films have ever won the Best Film award--THE ARTIST and WINGS, both of them now on fine blu-rays (WINGS skipped DVD altogether and leapfrogged directly from laserdisc to blu-ray). Both films had recorded soundtracks so they weren't entirely soundless. For those of us who love silent film and have collected whatever fragments survive of the film heritage of that era, it is a great thing to see a year like 2012 in which a new silent film takes the top honors. I'm glad I found out before the year was over. I will try to pay better attention next year.<br />Anyway, after the second viewing, I am sure there will be a third and a fourth and so on.

0307956350|5.0|I read the NY Times review of this novel online, and it prompted me to get the book for my summer reading. It did not disappoint, in fact I read it in one day because I could not put it down. This would be a good recommendation for any lover of the spy novel genre. I enjoyed the main character and her flaws, and her perception about being the new kid. It was hard to believe her naivete to some degree, but it build the suspense and I enjoyed all the twists in this novel. What I enjoyed most of all was the main character being a woman, who was not whiny and conniving, but practical, and understanding the need to do what is required in the moment to protect her family and way of live. I hope to see more of this character. Perhaps she won't be heading off into a banal career prior to her retirement after all. I suspect, she could find more intrigue, even as a lackey pushing paper in an embassy.
B0081KTI0E|5.0|This was a pretty scary movie. It's a little hard to get past the Harry Potter thing, but there's a good twist at the end and we did jump several times. All in all I liked it enough to watch it a 2nd time with a friend.

I picked Moneyball to load on to the unit because, even though I'm an Australian, I am a rusted-on Yankee fan and find Baseball fascinating.<br /><br />I thought it to be an excellent, insightful book on the business of baseball.

When the DVD begins, there is a parental control screen and you have to punch in your DVD's parental control numbers or the DVD will not play.  If you never knew your DVD parental control numbers and then go through your DVD setup to reset your own parental control numbers, it still will not play.  I googled and found that MANY people were not able to view the DVD because of this problem.  I bought this DVD some time ago and only now had time to watch it, or TRY to watch it.  Guess what, when I tried to return the video, Amazon says my \\"window\\" of return has expired.  I just want to warn people!  I feel totally ripped off.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I ADORE this book. I really do! I bought this read it once couldn't get enough and had to read it again, that should say something. I would recommend this one over and over.<br /><br />I'm at a loss... how can I try to explain my feelings?<br /><br />Even if you have never experienced some of these situations that does not mean that you will not get them.  Yeah okay, I admit it... some people who have never had this kind of a relationship or seen this in \\"REAL LIFE\\" I wouldn't expect you to comprehend this. I'm not saying no one can its just the truth.<br /><br />I want to be clear that yea I said anyone could understand and get this and that's true and all but... you  have to have an open mind as well. Other wise you will just jump to conclusions without ever really understanding what your actually reading. How does that saying go? Read between the lines...? You have to do that!<br /><br />Also grasp it with reality in \\"Real Life Actuality\\" the way the characters are portrayed is really how most people act (I am talking about Travis.)Even more so for the rest. This I know is true I have dealt with a **it load of stuff like this.<br /><br />I like this Authors writing more than I thought I could or would. This story speaks volumes if you let it. I felt more emotions reading this than I could have imagined... It's like I was there... saw, heard, felt everything that they ALL experienced. I'm starting to sound like a broken record so I'm packing it up for now. But read this. I mean it!!! At least give it a try? I promise its worth the money and is THAT good!

I actually have two sets of this one, one of the \\"On Thin Ice\\" ones, and the \\"Spring is in the Air\\" one, dumped in a huge Angry Birds reusable tote - and my kids dump it out and will be occupied for hours. If you buy a couple of the games and put them all together, it's gold for small kids. They love to build things, put the birds/pigs all over it, and then shoot them down with nerf guns ;)
B008MEM24S|5.0|good game. and but or hand cat just a dog it or get do so to it so come of go.
145162445X|5.0|This is an excellent extension of his youtube lecture that I saw sometime ago. I used to hate science and math because of the horror I experienced at school in a third world country. I avoided the subject and everything that has anything to do with it until a couple of years ago when a good friend of mine kept telling me to watch this video on youtube. So I eventually gave in and gave it a go. It was Lawrence Krauss' A Universe From Nothing. It's an hour long lecture and I have to say his video (and from reading a few other books recommended by said friend) has changed my view about science. I wish I had science teachers like him at school. It's non threatening, interesting and clear. It sparks your curiosity. Now I can't stop reading popular books about physics, cosmology, biology etc and even though sometimes I don't understand everything, it makes me want to learn and understand them even more. This book is just as good and as interesting as his lecture. It is a more in-depth and detailed version of the lecture. I'm not sure how eye opening or useful it would be to physics students who study the subject extensively but for lay people who are curious and interested in the subject with no formal physics education like me, I highly recommend it. It is a very good introduction to the subject. Especially if you enjoy books like Stephen Hawking's A Brief History Of Time (one of the books I read after watching Lawrence Krauss' lecture).
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its is.a vary good game<br />my lil brother likes to play it and he loves the games in the app is so fun<br />@(^_^)@

B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love this app.I do not actually own a kindle so its nice to have the Kindle app on my phone.
0345803485|1.0|Did this book really get a publisher's approval? Character development is lacking.  Christian is too young , too wealthy, too much. I find it hard to believe that a 21 year old virgin goes from hardly been kissed to willing sex slave.  Her name is typical too..of course is has to be Anastasia!<br /><br />I didn't count but the phrase inner goddess was used almost every two or three pages.  I hated the many Holy this and that.  The language was more fitting for a 16 year old.  The erotic parts frankly bored me.  They were endless.  I know there are two more that follow and there are a few things I would like answered but I couldn't bear reading another two books.  It was a complete waste of time and that is what I get for being curious.
B007P6VLRS|5.0|This is a wonderful album.  Can't stop listening to it front to back over and over again.  I am a huge SP fan, but even if I wasn't, I would still love the musicality of this album.

B006LSZECO|4.0|I loved the book till the very last page.  Sets up for a sequel but very unsatisfying. I was so disappointed.  Leaves you hanging like a bad nail!
B007SGM084|5.0|Did not want to put down.  Ready for more!  Loved all three books.  There were alot of negative comments as to the sexual aspect of the book but it was not nearly as graphic as I was originally lead to believe.  Was actually a wonderful love story that gives me hope.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved how this book--3rd in the series--brought the story full circle.  It completed the story of a young girls life & the maturity she achieved during her struggle to survive & care for her family.
0812981448|5.0|This review comes from loving a company and being inspired by its creator.  No one swayed me to be overwhelmed with motivation and love after learning of the good that is possible in business.  I learned of this because I love to read and like I read many things I read about TOMS and then \\"Start Something that Matters\\" and now you have the opportunity as well.  What has brought me to write is being chosen to part of TOMS Book for Bloggers.  If anyone is going to kick my a$$ into gear and fuel my passion up it's Blake Mycoskie, Chief Shoe Giver of TOMS.  First learning of Blake Mycoskie and TOMS in October of 2010 when reading through Costco Connection, I will admit that the cover of this magazine was magnetizing beyond norm for Costco Connection.  I read the article and my life forever changed, it's like I finally got it.  I finally understood what you give in comes back and what you think about and love comes to fruition.  Here for the first time I learned about Blake and his amazing company which provides a pair of shoes to a needy child for every pair sold.  While it is a profit company the base is built on giving and I was instantly in love.  I told everyone I knew and even people who I didn't know when they inquired about my cool kicks.  I received my first pair of TOMS from my Grammie Moe Ibbotson November 2011: they were supposed to be my Christmas gift but instead she gave as a thank you for taking her to a couple of Dr. Appointments.  The cutest thing is she had also got her herself a matching pair as my love and passion for the company was contagious and she was hooked, making her the coolest Grandmother in Palm Desert, California.  Flash forward a few years to now and TOMS has literally taken over my shoe rack, my gift giving and I have even used them as exchange for valuable goods.  I so love giving TOMS as an exchange for goods and services, I suggest you think of the ways you can do this too, it's so much more fulfilling then cash exchange!  On top oftaking over my feet fashion and my giving this company has overall contributed and inspired my journey to learn more about myself and love all, which has in turn led to a dream to help people give and fulfill dreams.  Blake's passion is inspiring and beyond heart touching and I was honored to be part of \\"TOMS Books for Bloggers\\" and be able to read and share \\"Start Something That Matters\\" with my readers.  This book honestly took me longer than most to finish.  I read each page a few times as EVERY page gives you something, an idea, a vision, a laugh, a smile or a warmed heart.  I found myself bending pages and making notes everywhere!  I have never received such natural motivation from a book.  I truly love \\"Start Something that Matters\\" for its wit and honesty.  You'll honestly feel like a friend of Blake's sitting right there with him while he helps you along and shares his successes and even failures.  My Grammie Moe Ibbotson passed recently and while I will miss her every day I breathe, I am thankful that forever I will have TOMS and the memories this company gave us.  It may not always seem \\"easy\\" to \\"Start Something that Matters\\" however it could never be easier than it is now with this book here to guide you along the path to make a difference.  Whenever I am feeling uninspired or lost on my path, I pick up \\"Start Something That Matters\\" and go through it again, finding new inspirations and redirection on my current path.  Thank you Blake Mycoskie for sharing your story, we look forward to your future books.    LoveJoylyn  Follow me on Twitter LoveJoylyn  New Blog coming soon at [...]
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was really good. I first got interested in it because of all the sex scenes my friends kept talking about. But what kept my interest going once I started to read was the story line. I wanted to see where things were going with Ana and Christian. This is a must read!
076790592X|5.0|Tuesdays with Morrie by Mitch Albom<br />Reviewed by Jackie Paulson (July 2012)<br />I have to admit that I have had this book on my shelves for awhile and finally got down to reading it.  I have only gotten great reviews from others and I am so glad I read it.<br />The main characters are Mitch Albom and his professor Morrie Schwartz.  The day of graduation Mitch handed this teacher a gift which was a brief case.  Later in life Mitch finds his professor, after he sees his professor on television (Nightline).  Mitch meets with his professor each Tuesday to visit his professor to talk.  The rest of this book is the 14 Tuesdays and their conversations before death takes Morrie to heaven.<br />The topics they covered in his 14 Tuesdays cover:<br />acceptance,<br />communication,<br />love,<br />values,<br />openness,<br />and happiness.<br /><br /> Mitch Albom expressed the importance of forging a culture of one's own to transcend the tyranny of popular culture, suggesting that the media are preoccupied with death, hatred, violence and depression. Quoting his favorite poet, W. H. Auden, Schwartz insists we must \\"love each other or perish\\".<br />I enjoyed this book more than I thought I would.  It was very encouraging to see how Morrie dealt with his disease and death.  I was touched that Mitch took the Tuesdays to be with his old professor and to endure their talks until his last breathe took place.<br />© 2012
B0014D6PCO|5.0|Loved it. Such an amazingly awesome film! Thumbs up to Christopher Nolan and Christan Bale! What a masterpiece of a movie.
B00785P2QC|5.0|its good for passing time while I'm fasting. hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh j h h u u u u u u u u uu u u u u u
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is wildly addicting, from the actual gameply to the store and coins. Everything is perfect for beginners and hardcore enthusiasts. I would recommend this game to anyone.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|You will love this app.  I have been playing it for at least 2 mo. and still love it.  You will see.
B0063IH60K|3.0|The game is easy to use but it is very difficult.  I only win about one in a hundred whereas. With my iPhone solitaire game I win about one out of ten.
B007KZY1YY|5.0|Heard about it and had to have the kindle version as my hard copy was on rotation it came quick and was great
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This app has 126 games on it hence the 101+25. I admit that some of the games are a little cheesy but most are quite addicting and fun. It is also quite fun to be able to work for them when you work hard on a game and do well you can often activate others untill you unlock them all. Its completly free so go ahead! try it out!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Just came from the movie theater and couldn't wait to speak on this epic movie. I won't give any spoilers but I will say what I have to say about this film. Christopher Nolan gave the best end to any movie trilogy by introducing the perfect evil entitity for Batman to face off with, Bane. Bane is pure evil and that's all he is. You felt real horrow when he spoke, when his plans come to fluition, and when he gives you his eyes. Ann Hathaway played Catman flawlessly and stole the show in her scenes. Dark Knight Rises plays on all emotions when watching it. It's dark, gritty, and comes together masterfully. I was almost to tears and can't wait to add this to my blu-ray collection.
B007V2UGPE|1.0|ok so it was good for 1 moth. then it erased all progress and hello its 220mb huge.it just to sukey
B002PE2BXI|4.0|First off i give the music a 5. This pressing gets a 4. Three quarters of this double lp sound great. Feels live if turned up. I have an issue when halfway through Lights Out the album got hung up. Not sure why, so i cleaned what was already a clean new vinyl. Things got better but not perfect. Where it got stuck before it just pops now. I'll live but it is annoying to have a pop on a brand new album.<br /><br />Second and the most irritating thing is where's the blue? Album description says pressed on blue vinyl. What a load of b.s. To my surprise both vinyls are black. I was looking forward to my first colored vinyl. Nope, not this time. I find this problem just stupid. Why say blue vinyl and not actually follow through. There are more UFO 180 gram vinyls i want that say green or red vinyl. I'll venture to say they too will show up black.<br /><br />If buying because you love UFO, like i do, then do not hesitate. Strangers In The Night captures UFO at their best. If interested for colored vinyl collection, don't bother!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|as an artist,a colorist, i have been captured by martins ability to verbally paint vivid pictures with his words. i truly am moved by his talent as a writer. what a story!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is for all ages I love it so much my kids are six years old and they love it too.  I highly recommend.
0802473156|5.0|Many things covered you will know, but it can make a huge difference to be reminded since this is life-altering stuff we're learning about...
B0059XTUB8|5.0|Purchased this because I have been wanting to watch this movie for a while. As soon as I received it, I made sure that I watched it to make sure the DVD was in perfect condition and it was!! There is no damage to the case or the DVD. I am glad that I purchased from this seller. I'm glad that I am able to add to my DVD collection. I love My Week with Marilyn :)
030758836X|1.0|I stayed up late to finish Gone Girl.  It was a waste of time.  I liked the first part of the book, but began to lose interst as it became ridiculous.  I figured the ending would  help me to like the book a bit. But no!  It was even more far-fetched.
B0086700CM|2.0|it won't let me play on my friend's kindle. when ever I play it won't turn. but when she does it, it works just fine!!!! it's like her kindle hates me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1416562605|4.0|Quite an engrossing novel, narrated by low caste Balram from the slums of the 'Darkness' (poor rural India in contrast to the 21st century 'Light').<br />Having gained the position of Chauffeur to a wealthy family, he is torn by his feelings towards his employers...Increasingly aware of the corruption, both political and personal, of his 'superiors', Balram determines to break out of the chicken coop in which the poorer classes are kept down...
B001BANK32|4.0|This earlier work of Stephen King still remains fresh and keeps you caught in its grip, eager to flip to the next page and continue on to the very end despite how many years have passed since it's first conception. It has not staled in time or become dated as some stories do. As one of his earlier works, it's not the masterpiece that the Stand is by far, but its characters are endearing and lend for you to sympathize and see a little bit of your self in the good, bad an ugly encounters that occur to them.<br /><br />Stanley Kuprick and the cast did a great job with the film and no one can argue that Jack's Jack is engrossingly believable in the film but over all the tale seems so much more in depth and wrought with despair by reading it. As a fan of horror and also of Stephen King, this book still manages to make the hair on the back of my neck raise more than once despite reading it a second time after many years and having just recently re-watched the film.<br /><br />When they say it's a page turner of a book that will keep you on the edge of your seat, this is exactly what they mean and why King is praised for what he does. So sit back and let the Overlook Hotel invite you in.
B008MEM24S|5.0|great game...we love Perry!  The levels are interesting &amp; I love the dialogue.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes where's my water.
B001IYVUEW|3.0|This movie was geared for the teen crowd. Plot was ok but drawn out.  This movie could have been made it half the time and been a much better movie. Way too many fight and chase sceens and too much filler (less is more in some cases). Did they pay the director by the minute? It's an ok movie but if you want a deep or intellegent movie this is't it.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I love social networking and this app is so easy to use and works great on my kindle fire.  I use this everyday.
B008MEM24S|3.0|disappointed in the graphics...in Where is my Water, the definition of the graphics us so much better.  HTC Incredible 4G.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love this app and I love playing it on my Kindlee Fire. I just wish I could transfer games from my iphone to my kindle.
1439148953|2.0|I don't know what most readers saw in this novel to have given it more than a 3 star rating.  Many of the characters lack any depth to them and they all seem so superficial.  Everytime I thought something important or relevant would be revealed to explain some of the lose ends in this story, it just fell flat on its face! Some of the characters' actions and purpose are never fully developed nor explained such as Father Flood's true intentions or why Rose's opinion was so important to Eilis.  When I got to the middle of the story, I had hopes that it would finally pick up and have some sort of climatic moment but it never did.  Eilis' mother still remained as the same dull, resigned woman who seemed to be living in her own little fantasy world while Eilis just floats around not knowing where her heart really belongs.  It just became so predictable and the ending just had me laughing at how Eilis goes full circle in discovering that settling is the next best thing rather than facing reality, consequences and what's really in her heart.
B008MEM24S|5.0|they should make doctor doofinshmerts<br />and controllable passers and Carl please please now now now now now now now now
B008MEM24S|5.0|I thought this was just going to be a rehash of Where's My Water? but this game certainly delivers. Lots of fun.
B004JHY8A8|5.0|This book is very good and I surely recommend it.<br />It is a page-turner in the first few pages.<br />I did not like the end so much but the story, as a whole, was worth it.<br />Good for everyone who likes sad stories.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I like it but when I get a baby I end up abandoning it and I'm out of acorns. bummer.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This book is definitely not for everyone. I think 80% of it has sex descriptions.<br />It is not that sex scenes, or in this case, very descriptive sex scenes, in a book are bad, but why in the whole book?<br />But then again, perhaps thats why so many people loved the book.<br /><br />This book reminded me very much of \\"TWILIGHT\\" because:<br /><br />* Christian Grey (or should I say Edward Cullen) keeps saying \\"I'm not good for you... etc\\" at the beginning of the story (like EDWARD CULLEN), plus he is so handsome, irresistible, all women like him, he's rich, adopted, he's never had a real relationship, etc. just like Edward<br />* Ana Steele (or Bella Swan) is a senior, clumsy, get's embarassed easily, is not good at sports, her mother has a new husband and now lives in the beach, and most importantly, she's obsessed with this man. She has an old car, previously owned by Jose (Bella has an old truck, previously owned by Jacob Balck's family)<br />* Jose (or Jacob Black) is Ana's best friend & makes Christian Grey jealous because he's in love with Ana.<br />* Christian's family thought he would never find someone for him, until Ana appeared (sounds familiar? yes, just like Edward's family)<br />* Christian's adoptive mother is a doctor / Edward's adoptive father is a doctor<br /><br />Finally, I think the book is poorly written, it is very repetitive. For example, the main character, Ana: flushes, chews her bottom lip & rolls her eyes during the whole book.
B0011Z51QG|5.0|the purple rain album is a classic yesterday as today the little Nicky is a track that you for get but once you here again you remember \\"o yeah that's the song \\" you then cant stop playing it love this down load album
B0012GTZC0|4.0|The first book I read from Ken Follet was \\"Fall of giants\\" and I loved it, therefore, I decided to read another one.<br />I was kind of hoping Eye of the Needle would be as good as the above mentioned but it wasn't.<br />I finished it because I finish all the books I start, not because I was very drawn into it.<br />In the first few pages you learn everything you need to know about the characters. The middle gets a little boring. Luckily, the end is really entertaining because something unexpected (at least for me) happens.<br />My review is not so inspiring to get you people to read the book but believe me, If you like suspense novels, this one is good.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book had a great story line it kept your attention all the way through the series.  Was afraid to read it because of the sex but was glad I did
0793906091|5.0|This final version of the Trilogy to be released before 1997 and the endless tinkering. The picture is gorgeous for VHS, and the sound is solid. The videos are fullscreen, which I think was the only option originally except for the fake widescreen of the Laserdiscs.<br /><br />Worth picking up all these years after the demise of Videotape so I can watch as close to the originals in excellent quality as I can get.
B00845PV16|3.0|The movie quality, all the way around, was good.  The movie itself, the story, was lacking a lot.  Only worth watching once; maybe twice after a few years.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game I love to play it it is awrdome u should try it and play it yourself all the time
B008M34INW|4.0|I was surprised that it turned better than I thought it would. I really enjoyed this movie. The trailer is misleading and not interesting but watching the movie paid off. I am glad i took the risk of watching. Nice!
B002I0J5FG|5.0|I had this game back ordered and had to wait a while to get it. The time spent waiting almost killed me (even though it was only a week) but the game didn't disappoint and was well worth the wait.
B004XXIHS2|5.0|I read A Kiss Before Dying  on the edge of my seat.  This is a real page turner all the way through.  I put in on my Kindle Fire so I had the great looking cover to draw me in and peek my interest and I wasn't disappointed from page 1 to the end.  It's a great summer read.
B0013FSL3E|1.0|The box the movie came in was in terrible shape, but the movie looked fine.  Looks can be deceiving.  We put it in and got through just enough of the movie for everyone to be interested when it got stuck and we couldn't get it to fast forward, skip, or anything. Disappointing.
B006X08EZY|1.0|This CD was recommended in the L.A. Times and I always liked the Talking Heads, so I thought it might be nice driving music, soothing for the ever-present traffic snarls and craziness that is L.A. driving. And maybe I'm missing the point not being a musician myself, but I kept thinking why are all these people clapping between songs, either they're drunk or paid too much for their tickets and think they should be thinking it's great. Well it's super boring with stupid lyrics at least by Caetano Veloso. Some songs were so bad I had to skip to the next without even finishing. I did listen to the whole way too long CD trying to find something to like, but nothing. Will not listen again and will probably donate it to the library or throw it away. Also, for some reason I assumed the Times was recommending recently released music, not something from a concert in 2004! Guess I should have read the fine print closer before ordering.
030758836X|4.0|This well written and intricately woven novel gives us two married and memorable creeps, who deserve each other. They charm and beguile us by degree, and we, the discerning reader, vacillate between the two, deciding who is victim and who is the perp, only to have this wholly undone, in the very next chapter. I kept hearing the voice on my Garmin say \\"RECALCULATING\\", in her exasperated tone, as Ms Flynn toyed with my flimsy assumptions. And this in itself is the very subject of her book! Psychopaths are often gifted with a winning credulity, and the sneaky tricks the author deploys to manipulate us, are the same sneaky subterfuges that the couple use on each other, as well as all the gullible characters in the book. When the book was over I felt duped by what I thought was a fairly contrived ending, until I was forced to concede that this was also genius! Tied up in a Gordian Knot of their own making, eating each other alive for eternity!
B0026J8LHM|5.0|Dream Theater are one of those bands that just cannot do any wrong. Coming off of \\"Systematic Chaos\\" in 2007, they have returned with yet another amazing record, \\"Black Clouds And Silver Linings\\" in 2009. And there should be almost no room for discussion about whether or not it sounds like they are in tip-top form. And to say that they are firing on all cylinders would be a gross understatement. Nobody -- and I mean nobody! -- can quite do justice to the top-shelf musicianship -- including a wide array of great riffs, even greater (and more innovative) solos, exceptional bass work, and excellent drumming -- that these legendary progressive metal masters bring to the table time and time again. But anyone that knows anything should know that this band will never be one to stop there! After all, they didn't gain the status of being one of metal's all-time smartest for no reason. This means that such superior instrumental prowess is always augmented by truly excellent and ingenious songwriting. As such, tricky time signatures, varied tempos, infectious, long-lasting hooks, melodies that are as unique as they are irresistible, memorable choruses, taught dynamics, really broad and epic scopes, and innumerable painstaking nooks and crannies are ever-present in their music, too. And playing it safe and taking the easy way out, selling out by opting for a more accessible and commercialized sound, and/or coasting on the coattails of success achieved previously (no matter how sizeable it may have been) have absolutely no place in it.<br /><br />2009 marked the twenty-four year anniversary of being together as a musical group (this Boston-based fivesome formed - that is to say, embarked on a first-ever tour -- way back in the year 1986). Yet despite having nearly almost two and a half decades (as of press time) under their belt, as well as being credited for ten whole studio full-lengths, \\"Black Clouds And Silver Linings\\" is irrefutable proof that Dream Theater are still going as strong as ever. And to say that they are firing on all cylinders would be a gross understatement. These two things are lucky for us, too, because they remain just about untouchable when that happens. As a result, this 2009 release, very much keeps up with the usual tradition of excellence. Does it rank as one of the band's best works to date? Absolutamente! True, D.T. have only themselves to blame -- creating such a steadfastly splendid backing catalogue was purely optional -- but nobody should lend this record a single ear without first taking a moment to consider the steep competition that it is up against. Even so, \\"BC&SL\\" emerges darn near the utmost tip-top in their entire, massively influential, universally-acclaimed career.<br /><br />It is comprised of only a handful of cuts (six, to be exact); but each of which are at least five-and-a-half minutes in length, and with most clocking-in at well-over twelve. Hence, none of them should be labeled as a \\"track,\\" as they definitely have less in common with normal \\"tracks\\" per say than they do with very original, multi-dimensional, carefully-calculated, and terrifically-well-written epics. The end product is an extremely contagious and highly-addictive musical opus that, alone, is more memorable than everything that many bands can muster in a whole career. And the exceptional, polished (but not overly so), professional, and articulate production skills of seven-string ace John Petrucci is the icing on the cake.<br /><br />The first couple of songs showcase D.T.'s surprisingly heavy and angry side. After a somber, piano-laden intro, \\"A Night To Remember\\" switches to a brisk speed metal-paced tempo, crunchy riffs, and blast beats (thus displaying drummer Mike Portnoy's unsurprisingly dexterous skills). And after letting loose a wah-wah-inflected guitar solo that rips the air, the band proceed to take on a Dragonforce-style fashion by trading off melodic leads with propulsive keyboard runs. (Both of which are anchored by thunderous bass grooves.) Vocally, frontman James LaBrie spends most of his time doing his best Dave Mustaine impression, but a soaring melodic chorus is also included, as are some Opethian death metal inspired growls when things begin to wrap up. (And \\"A Night To Remember\\" is also of note for its use of a continuum and Lap Steel guitar.) \\"A Rite Of Passage\\" brings back those Megadeth-esque vocals for its chorus, but not before a soft guitar and sludgy, downtuned bass line in the intro, and thrashy, staccato riffing, grumbling bass lines, and galloping drum beats in the verses. Petrucci also tosses in a wealth of nice, soaring guitar harmonies and a really memorable, lengthy, and wailing solo section.<br /><br />These two tracks are the perfect lead in to \\"Wither,\\" a fittingly climactic conclusion to all of the energy and momentum attained previously. And clocking in at only a mere five and a half minutes in length, it is a relatively brief song. But man, is it pretty! Aside from a surprisingly blazing, Zakk Wylde-ish shredding electric guitar solo near the end, \\"Wither\\" is a fantastically elegant and docile, near Rush-worthy brooder that really shows off the extent of LaBrie's pipes. (His clean vocals sound very warm and positively excellent, here, as they soar over a foundation of dreamy acoustic strumming.) But as soon as this tune is over comes \\"The Shattered Fortress,\\" which is nearly thirteen minutes long, and is cut into three pieces (\\"Restraint,\\" \\"Receive,\\" and \\"Responsible\\"). It is also quite possibly the record's heaviest moment -- for the first few minutes, at least, when it acts like a surprisingly brutal, charging, full-on thrash attack. And aside from a nice bit of sweep picking, melody is used as an afterthought right up until about the seven and a half minute mark. After this point comes a nice, proggy breakdown iced with both clean, harmonic singing and visceral, deathly growls. A little extra guitar shredding (i.e. some more chunky riffs, and another really excellent, winding, multi-parted solo) is added to the mix some time later.<br /><br />Following this comes \\"The Best Of Times,\\" another gorgeous, mostly acoustic ballad (with plenty more exceptional melodic soloing) which wouldn't be out of place on an Iron Maiden album or Opeth's \\"Damnation.\\" Some Apocalyptica-like symphonic-sounding flourishes pepper it, too. \\"Black Clouds And Silver Linings\\" concludes with \\"The Count Of Tuscany,\\" which clocks in at well-over nineteen and a half minutes, making it the set's pinnacle. It begins and ends the same way: With gorgeous, feather-light melodic guitar plucking (and, in the case of the beginning, richly textured harmonic soloing). In between, the wildly technical and expansive number can be heard switching back-and-forth between sweeping arpeggios and heavy, driving riffs. And John Myung chips in throughout \\"Count\\" with noteworthy bass work, including solid, flowing bass lines. Myung is also granted some time in the spotlight around the midpoint, when he uncorks a tricky melodic bass groove.

Vocally, frontman James LaBrie spends most of his time doing his best Dave Mustaine impression, but a soaring melodic chorus is also included, as are some Opethian death metal inspired growls when things begin to wrap up. (And \\"A Night To Remember\\" is also of note for its use of a continuum and Lap Steel guitar.) \\"A Rite Of Passage\\" brings back those Megadeth-esque vocals for its chorus, but not before a soft guitar and sludgy, downtuned bass line in the intro, and thrashy, staccato riffing, grumbling bass lines, and galloping drum beats in the verses. Petrucci also tosses in a wealth of nice, soaring guitar harmonies and a really memorable, lengthy, and wailing solo section.<br /><br />These two tracks are the perfect lead in to \\"Wither,\\" a fittingly climactic conclusion to all of the energy and momentum attained previously. And clocking in at only a mere five and a half minutes in length, it is a relatively brief song. But man, is it pretty! Aside from a surprisingly blazing, Zakk Wylde-ish shredding electric guitar solo near the end, \\"Wither\\" is a fantastically elegant and docile, near Rush-worthy brooder that really shows off the extent of LaBrie's pipes. (His clean vocals sound very warm and positively excellent, here, as they soar over a foundation of dreamy acoustic strumming.) But as soon as this tune is over comes \\"The Shattered Fortress,\\" which is nearly thirteen minutes long, and is cut into three pieces (\\"Restraint,\\" \\"Receive,\\" and \\"Responsible\\"). It is also quite possibly the record's heaviest moment -- for the first few minutes, at least, when it acts like a surprisingly brutal, charging, full-on thrash attack.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|it was super fun but some of the things were really hard to get... also that u can get more points for owning thing is slightly manipulative but it is still fun
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|THIS BOOK WAS AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love the story of a troubled guy who changes his world at all costs to prove his undying love to a woman. This age old plot was done in a great new age way. You'll fall in love with Travis, be envious of Abby, expect greatness from friends like America & Shepley, you'll just want more in life! It's so well written it's kind of ridiculous. While I was reading the book, I kid you not... I felt like i was the main character! I could almost feel and smell and see everything that was being described. The little looks on people's faces, the way the environment was, the feel and vibes of people watching and what not. The details were excellent but not over barring. This is a major page turner so if you're not ready to lose a night's sleep don't pick it up quite yet. i finished it in 2 nights after work and DID lose SOME sleep because it was that intriguing =)
B00415ZW58|4.0|This drama was a lot better that I thought it was going to be. It kept me watching from beginning to end and it didn't drag the way some drama has a tendency to do. I'm glad I bought it. I highly recommend it.

0393338827|3.0|I really enjoyed Lewis' \\"The Big Short,\\" but through-out I kept waiting for him to address the other half of the equation, namely the government's intervention in creating the sub-prime market in the first place.  I literally kept asking, \\"Okay, so when do we hear about Fannie, Freddie, and the Community Reinvestment Act?\\"  Obviously the wall street financiers are his focus, and legitimately deserve the scorn he heaps on them for their greed, arrogance, hubris, and stupidity.  But Lewis fails to examine why there were borrowers in the first place, and the government's substantial role in encouraging this ridiculous lending in the first place, which was a bipartisan effort going back 25 years.    Lewis almost ignores the borrowers who signed the risky loans in the first place, and were trying to get rich quick.  When he does mention them it is to excuse their behavior and to condescend to them, suggesting they were either dumb or just failed to examine what they were getting into, but instead followed the lies they were told to make by unscrupulous lenders.  Where is their responsibility?  Why as a taxpayer should I feel sorry for the strawberry picker making $14,000 a year with a $720,000 home he uses as an example, or the Las Vegas stripper with 5 homes?  We are the ones on the hook for their excess, and Lewis acts as if it was perfectly reasonable for them to believe that they could afford these homes. The fact is that the housing bubble along with the dot-com bubble and others before it were fueled in large part by the greed of the \\"get rich quick\\" mentality, exemplified by the \\"flip your house\\" style of shows that were all over the TV channels preceding the crisis.  It is not enough to merely castigate Wall Street and excuse the borrowers, and fail to examine the incentives directed at the market by the federal government.  Anyone who expects a full understanding of our economic melt-down will not find it simply by reading this book.    Here's a good summary forthose who are unaware of the role of the Community Reinvestment Act in promoting the crisis:    [...]

B0052VUNHC|4.0|Really fun to read. I recommend it if you like juicy romance fiction books :) I can't wait for the book 'Walking Disaster' by the same author. It's not a sequel but the story from Travis's point of view :) Enjoy!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Well written-kept my interest! I couldnt put my iPad down!!!I cannot wait to read the other two books!!! I highly recommend this book!!!
B004LROMX4|4.0|I'm writing this just as a FYI. I received this and played the first episode and it was choppy. Well I have a Samsung 3D Player and 24p Mode was set to auto. For whatever reason since the show was made for TV perhaps it was shot @ 29.97/30 but the BD Player thought it would play it at 24p which pretty much makes it un watchable. Turning that off for this disc fixes it. :)

B00008LOS1|5.0|Does anyone out there know what concert this second disc came off of or what date/s that it was recorded?<br /> As stated in the synopsis it's part of the failed \\"Lifehouse Project\\" by Pete Townsend of The Who and I don't think<br /> that even the first disc sounds the same as the single edition disc that they also sell on Amazon there are two different<br /> versions of this CD and album and they both sound different, but the live stuff is a definate positive bonus that I happen to love.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|great game especially for old school mario fans. just try it and you will like this one. it is fast becoming my favorite free game ever!
B008GXHOFW|3.0|well? its pretty good, but I would reccomend the wii one more, though its 49.00 lol I wanna trade skyward sword afraid I might get like 10$ for it though.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it is a fun and child-friendly game. It keeps me entertained. If I give this game a review, I can continue playing it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|anyone who says you may get bored with this game has unrealistic standards. it never gets boring! i've beaten every level in both the regular and jumbo packs and then went back and did them all again. it's very addicting. NO problems at all with my kindle fire. even if it hadn't been free and I paid for it I'd still be verrrrry satisfied with the decision. it does get challenging in the larger grids, and takes a couple of tries to get a star for the levels, but it's not impossible - I completed all of them with stars. probably my favorite app out of all the ones i've installed.
B006N0YWGY|5.0|Got this for my kindle fire and cant stop playing. U steer a boat while its going full throttle running over and through anything that gets in your way. Buy low and sell high easy as that. Made over $600,000 once. Haven't got close to making that again but it's fun trying. Keep up the good work and make more apps like this.

B008MEM24S|1.0|come on  ppl let the game be free becauce when i saw this i was gonna get it but then i went on the appstore and it not free so make it free
B00000J9HF|4.0|Having read all the other reviews, unusually I can see where all the reviewers are coming from.  I bought this when it first came out years ago and have listened to it numerous times.  The cast is top drawer and in excellent voice, Giulini a wonderful and respected Verdi conductor (I love his Trovatore and Don Carlo), yet I find the recording only intermittently exciting.<br /><br />The recording acoustic is somewhat distant, with a warmth that soft-pedals the treble.  It sounds to me like sitting in the upper tier at the Met with a crowded house that soaks up treble.  That's OK when you're watching and listening, but not so OK at home when you're just listening.  I wish the sound were brighter.<br /><br />The characterizations from the principals are beautiful and I do see why some reviewers love the performance. Its high point is the duet \\"Vendetta, tremenda vendetta.\\"  In this number Giulini sets a steady pace, furnishing an obsessive accompaniment in the strings.  The cumulative power of the duet, which ends the second act, is tremendous--nobody does it better than Giulini.  If the whole performance was at this level it would be the ten-star champion of all Rigoletto recordings!<br /><br />You may like it . . . or not.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|i absolutely love it!! its so addicting!!! I just love it so much!! and I would reccomend it for everyone!!!
B0052QXAEK|3.0|I had high expectations for this flick, but it didn't quite make it to the level I wanted. I really enjoyed the performances by supporting characters, but many key moments of acting on the part of the two leads were less than stellar. I had trouble understanding why they reacted to each other the way they did in several situations and the reactions weren't believable... rather obviously staged and unnatural. Overall, an OK film, but disappointing compared to expectations.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|We bought this CD mostly because my daughter found it and it was a great deal... It turns out that it is her favorite CD even after a month. I'm sick of it, but she loves it and she's very happy with it.

B007SYWFRM|4.0|only find one thing wrong with this game they need to have more ways to earn acorns especially if that is how we pay for 75% of the animals and decor and fun stuff.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The ability to have multiple translations at your finger tips combined with the speed at which you are able to navigate books and verses make this app a must have.  Being able to listen to the spoken word is a plus.
B000HL09MG|2.0|Maybe it's just beyond me, but people looking for deep meaning in this movie may very well be disappointed. In my opinion it was slow, oversexed and overhyped.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|5 stars for being worth a dam<br />Ive played around with apps since I got my kindle fire.  its rare I come upon one that doesn't completely suck.  flow is great, sometimes challenging, and ive played it a lot more than any 99-3.00 game ive played so far. give these guys some support, they aren't actually out on a limb to rip you off, the game is worth your time.
030758836X|2.0|I would have bet my CAR that the ending of this book would at least be clever. It's anything but. And satisfying. It's not. Really poor job.<br /><br />I'm with the guy who said \\"4.5 stars for the writing, 1 star for the ending.\\"<br /><br />I was into it right up until the money belt. Then, as with many thrillers, it gets stupid and bizarre and I can no longer \\"suspend disbelief.\\" A lake house with a WALL AROUND IT? How can it be a lake house and have a wall around it? Things go rapidly downhill from that point onward.<br /><br />The author just got very sloppy, lazy and rushed at the end. Given how clever the first 4/5ths of the book is, the ending reads like a high school English assignment to \\"finish this book by Tuesday.\\"<br /><br />Cannot recommend this book.
0449011917|3.0|Anyone can scour the literally thousands of reviews already here to get a feel for the book.  My review solely concerns the quality of the audiobook re-recording done in 2011 or so, with Roy Dotrice returning after being too sick to originally read A Feast for Crows in 2005-2006.<br /><br />Roy Dotrice is a very old man, so I think he is due some respect and leniency when it comes to making errors; ever since the very first book, he's occasionally slipped up with words, saying \\"Jeffrey\\" instead of \\"Joffrey\\", \\"Brian\\" instead of \\"Bran\\", \\"Caitlin\\" instead of \\"Catelyn\\" and so on.  I call it a case of \\"old man\\" and it's not worth much notice, in my opinion.<br /><br />Here, he does so less frequently, but has apparently either forgotten how certain names were pronounced or else changed them.  Either way, it seems no one bothered to edit this or try to correct him after the first few times.  It's not a case of my nitpicking of how it's supposed to be pronounced or how it's pronounced in the series; it's how Roy Dotrice himself had pronounced them in the previous three books he'd read.<br /><br />-\\"Raff the Sweetling\\" he had pronounced \\"Raff\\" previously, now pronounces like \\"Raif\\".<br />-\\"Catelyn\\" he uses \\"Caitlin\\" almost all the time.<br />-\\"Brienne\\" he had pronounced like \\"Bri-Een\\" and now goes as \\"Bree-Ann\\"<br />-\\"Targaryen\\" he had pronounced as it is in the TV series, now pronounces something like \\"Tagarrin\\"<br />-\\"Petyr\\" he had pronounced \\"Pitar\\" or \\"Pitire\\" now pronounces as simply \\"Peter\\"<br /><br />In this audiobook recording, he seems to have forgotten his own continuity from the previous books, as certain types of voices he uses for different characters, with variances in pitch, tone, and accent, tend to waver or are completely discarded; Arya abruptly takes on a sharp accent she'd never had, Brienne and Jaime waver greatly, and so on.  Petyr Baelish probably has the greatest disparity, going from a vaguely nasally purr in the first three and first quarter of this book, to a very loud, throaty sort of voice he usually reserves for a character like Jon Umber.  Robert Baratheon's voice has also gone from being boisterous and bawdy in the first book to as \\"proper\\" and warbling as Maester Aemon.  He still maintains Tyrion's voice the same though.<br /><br />This is in no way Roy Dotrice's fault or problem, as I feel the producers should have mustered up the courage at some point to correct Roy Dotrice.  There should be no disrespect intended in helping the man.<br /><br />But one thing that is the producer and/or editors fault is the timing.  Apparently there were segments in the recordings where re-takes had to be done over several sentences, and whoever edited it together did a very poor job of it; it often sounds as if Roy Dotrice were rushing, allowing almost no time between sentences.  It becomes mechanically clear oftentimes, with a sentence beginning so soon after one ends that it is impossible for the human voice to do so.  This happens far too often to be a simple mistake, and becomes a genuine distraction, particularly where a character's thoughts bleed out onto a sentence with no spacing to distinguish that \\"THIS LINE\\" was meant to be spoken and THIS LINE was an inner monologue.<br /><br />Overall, I risk saying that this was simply a lazy effort.  People complained about the loss of Roy Dotrice as narrator when A Feast for Crows audiobook first came out, and it was with much fanfare that they announced this 2012 re-recording.  Either the makers really were not pleased about doing this again or else rushed the job.s book, to a very loud, throaty sort of voice he usually reserves for a character like Jon Umber.

B007AJFSJW|5.0|Paul Krugman has again demonstrated why he is one the leading economists of our time.  Anyone who desires a detailed but easy to understand explanation of our current economic crisis should read \\"Stop this Depression Now!\\"  Even more importantly, Krugman supplies the solution to the gravest economic crisis of our time.  Readers should all reach out to their elected representatives to embrace this solution.  As Krugman notes, the solution is simple and can be enacted very quickly.  All we lack is the political will.  Krugman has done what he can.  It is up to voters to reach out and make it happen.  Thank you Mr. Krugman.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I loved this book, it was a easy read. i would recommend this book to anyone. It only took me a couple of days to read and i would read it again
B004QL7K6G|1.0|I don't know how anyone can say this was a good movie. I found it rank, STUPID, boring, lousy acting, lousy plot, not entertaining, and a waste. If it didn't star Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston then it wouldn't draw ANY viewing.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I didn't want to put it down. A must read for any introvert or anyone who lives with one. I've read a variety of things on the topic over a number of years but this is the first one ever that provided me with the definitive permission to just be exactly who I am. So good that I've since started following this author on social media.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have tried 6 Bible apps in the past year.  YouVersion is the only one that offers a simple &amp; quick navigation system and a huge variety of translations and versions, even several foreign language translations.

B0002BO05S|4.0|The Greatest Story Ever Told is a 1965 epic biblical film starring Max Von Sydow in the role as Jesus. Another powerful role is played by Charlton Heston as John the Baptist. There is a slight problem with the film as many bit parts are played by famous actors and I can understand that they at the time of the release caused a distraction. Apart from this, I would say that it is a top notch film; great script, amazing music and set at the right pace. This is not an action film but a film that deals with contemplation and faith and should by no means be rushed. At times the film alters scripture and this is a bit irritating. Still, I very much enjoyed it and being a devout person I cherished both in my heart and spirit. Recommended. 4/5.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Great game with a Phineas and Ferb twist that makes it all the more fun! It even works really good on kindle fire unlike other apps! :)
B007PTJOV0|4.0|I am only on level 1-3, so far this game is pretty fun. But it is kinda hard to control sometimes. It reminds me of the first Mario Bros., I loved playing that game when I was a kid.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I must say I am late to the game when it comes to this series.  I watched the first season televised on HBO and was told by some friends that the books were really great.  They were not lying, the books are really good.  The attention to detail in this new world is incredible.  The characters are fully realized and you either love them or hate them.  Even the ones you hate you can't wait to get to the next chapter for.  I highly recommend this series to anyone who loves fantasy.  Watch out Tolkien lovers, I think Martin has created the new generation in fantasy writing.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|I've been told by so many people that I need to read this book. Everyone and their grandmother has INSISTED that I would love this novel.<br /><br />I really hate writing negative reviews. I'm a very optimistic person, and there are rarely any books I come across that I don't enjoy (in some way, shape or form).<br />I'm half way through \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\", and I already felt the need to write a review.<br />It really only takes me a couple days to finish a book. I've owned this for over a week, and I find myself dragging through it.<br />What sum it up, is a simple math equation: Twilight - Vampires + \\"Erotica\\" = Fifty Shades of Grey.<br />The similarities:<br />Christian Grey - A billionaire, stern, over protective, mysterious, never refers to Anastasia as Ana (must always be called by her proper name)<br />Edward Cullen - Rich, stern, way too over protective, mysterious, vampire, prefers Isabella<br /><br />Anastasia (Ana) - Overly dramatic, always fainting, a virgin, sweat pants, converse, crappy car, brunette, doesn't like being spoiled, stubborn, has an annoying guy friend who is in love with her (Jose').<br />Isabella (Bella) - Overly dramatic, ALWAYS fainting, a virgin, sweat pants, sneakers, crappy car, brunette, doesn't like being spoiled, stubborn, has an annoying guy friend who is in love with her (Jake).<br /><br />I think you get the point.<br /><br />The writing in it is absolutely terrible. The repetition of certain words and phrases will make you want to pull your hair out. If I have to read the words \\"penetrating eyes\\" one more time in this novel, I will probably throw my kindle across the room.<br />The main character (Ana), seems to climax for no good reason at all. Maybe it would make more sense if there was more detail. The sexual scenes in this book are just so bland. So.. cliche'.<br /><br />I'm trying my hardest to make it through this book.<br />Good luck to you and your e-readers. This book is not up to par with all the hype.

After watching the nerdy kid get bichslapped by nearly everybody he comes in contact with for the 1st 15-20 mins of the movie, i just couldn't take it any more. So i  picked up the remote and literally had my finger on the stop button. Then at the very second i was about to hit it, Michael B. Jordan appeared on the screen and i was like ok, if they're gonna start showing this little hottie now, well then i'll just have to give it more time to see what happens. THANK GOD I DID!! I woulda missed one helluva good movie!  Although many people complain that there are too many 'found-footage' films being made, i personally like that format because it turns what would be for me just another movie into something very realistic. The found footage genre makes movies look like you're watching things that actually were happening for real. In my opinion, take away that aspect of it and film it the regular way and its just another fictional movie. Now couple that with the top notch CGI that they used and dam, this turned out to be one awesomely realistic piece of fiction. Really good movie. Highly recommended.

B00846REIS|5.0|I know everyone is comparing this to Fifty shades of grey and yes that's true. It is like 50 shades, but in outline only. And that's where it ends. I think that the crossfire series stands in a spot all it's own in the erotica romance section. I loved the story of Eva and Gideon, so much so that I can tell you the difference between this series and 50 shades of grey. As much as I loved 50 shades I always felt like something was missing. And this series helped me realize what that was. Depth! 50 shades felt like I was getting an abridged version of the story. Like I wasn't getting all of it. The Crossfire series gave me two characters that are part of the elite but feel alienated from it and I wanted to know if they could do it. They're passion for each other is explosive and it shows in how they deal with it and their lives. Cary is the best friend everyone wants. Baggage and all, and I want so badly to fix him. This book has everything and a bag of chips. The relationship of this type of obsessive passion feels real and grounded and I love how Sylvia Day describes it. This is the difference between a professional writer and a new never before written writer. Two different styles, two different interpretations of a couple lost in passion and pain. You can love both series for different reasons.<br />Remember how many knock offs resulted from Harry Potter and twilight? Get use to it. It happens alot more than you think. If you read more you'd have already known that. So get over it. LOL

After going through the book, I felt that I had developed a strong fundamental understanding of the Python language.  In addition, the Heads First style was really fun, adding a lot of enjoyment to the learning process.  Now that I have completed this book I'm moving on to O'Reilly's Programming Python tome :)
1401301010|1.0|If you're looking for a wrong person to look up to, who shares only stories of his sex with a teenage skeleton model/tour hookers & drug relapses; with rare moments of pseudo-clarity and pseudo-spirituality; then this is a book for you.<br /><br />Unfortunately, for the rest of us it was a waste of time and a reason to hit head against the wall.<br /><br />All the girls were incredibly beautiful, all the sex was amazing, each drug experience would result in a spiritual cleansing and then the next girl would come and the story would start all over again. There are at least a dozen cycles of this meaninglessness.<br /><br />And I can imagine there's even more of that, as I started skipping pages after the famous ski trip adventure to get to content where John Frusciante is mentioned; and then I skipped most of the pages about One Hot Minute...<br /><br />The only good thing about the book are vague insights in recording the Red Hot Chili Peppers' albums; though magazine interviews with actual musicians in the band are a much better resource for that.<br /><br />Unless you are a woman with a fantasy about this man or are a teenage testosterone-filled sexually frustrated boy who likes to pose nude in front of the mirror and flex his muscles, do not read.

B005K2YRVG|5.0|I ordered this wondering if it would really fit my original style 6\\" Kindle. In previous reviews it sounded like there might be fit issues. I can say that if you have a $79 kindle this is the perfect cover. Mine slides in easily and there is not too much extra play. It's fits like a glove actually. If you are looking to also put your light in the case it will not work with this cover.  As far as the color goes I recieved exactly what was advertised. The paneling is black and edges are a dark grey. The interior is a soft red flannel type material. One previous reviewer stated that the red color bled on to the kindle. I have not encountered that issue. Although this is not a rigid case it is fairly stiff and I believe will protect my kindle if dropped in normal situations.<br /><br />***Update**<br /><br />I've now has this case for quite some time and it has held up over thousands of miles travelled.  The case still fits great and still has not bled any of the red interior color on my basic kindle.  It appears that Amazon is not selling these at this time but they are available from Timbuk2 directly.  Hopefully Amazon will carry them again for ease of purchase.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Okay, first of all, Rick Riordan is, like, my favorite author. If it weren't for R.I.F. (Reading Is Fundamental) books, I probably would have never found out about Rick Riordan or his five-star books. Our school library was giving out free R.I.F books when I was in 4th grade. I looked around, but they were all pretty much too short, too wierd looking, or girly. Then I saw one that seemed like it might not be TOO bad: The Lightning Theif. When I saw the title of the first chapter, &#34;I Accidentally Vaporize my Pre-Algebra Teacher,&#34; It looked like it would be really funny, too. I'll admit it; I was hooked. You know the feeling when you're playing the best video game ever, and you wish you never had to put down the controller? That's how Riordan makes me feel with his books. I gaurantee you, this is one heck of an awesome book and is 100% worth the price; in fact, I'm surprised at how cheap it is when it's such a good book. Also, if you're thinking; &#34;nah, I'm not into myths and heroes too much anyway.&#34; Well, by the end of this book, you'll be laughing so hard that... well, you get the idea. In case you loved this book and want to read the other books in this seires (which I'm sure you will), I'll tell you the names of the other 4 books in this seires:<br /><br />&#62;Book no. 2: The Sea of Monsters<br /><br />&#62;Book no. 3: The Titan's Curse<br /><br />&#62;Book no. 4: The Battle of the Labrynth<br /><br />&#62;Book no. 5: The Last Olympian<br /><br />If you're dissapointed because the seires is over (which I'm sure you will be), Riordan started a new seires with Percy Jackson and friends in it, called &#34;The Heroes of Olympus&#34; seires. He hasn't finished writing this seires yet; I'm still waiting for the third book to come out. I still have a few more things to say, but before I do, I'll tell you the books he's written for The Heroes of Olympus seires:<br /><br />&#62;Book no. 1: The Lost Hero<br /><br />&#62;Book no. 2: The Son of Neptune<br /><br />&#62;Book no. 3 (not out yet; but available for pre-order on Kindle) : The Mark of Athena<br /><br />Also, Rick has written a &#34;guide&#34; book for &#34;demigods.&#34; (If you read The Lightning Theif you should know what I mean.) It's called &#34;The Demigod Files.&#34; It has interviews with Percy and friends, word searches, adventures that Percy has undertaken, etc. One more thing (and sorry if this reveiw is getting a little boring) is that Rick has written another seires, sort of like Percy Jackson and the Olympians, but it's with Egyptian mythology instead. Before I was not at all interested in Egyptian mythology, and if you're the same way, I GAURANTEE you will like the Egyptian mythology seires, witch by the way is called &#34;The Kane Chronicles.&#34; There are 3 books in the seires, and they are: &#34;The Red Pyramid,&#34; The Throne of Fire,&#34; and &#34;The Serpent's Shadow.&#34; Well, I suppose that's all I have to say!<br /><br />P.S. A thousand apologies for any spelling mistakes. ;O)

159448385X|5.0|I read the Kite Runner first and fell in love with Hosseini's writing. As I was in line at Half Price Books buying A Thousand Splendid Suns, the lady in line behind me said, \\"Oh you will LOVE that book!.\\" She was right.<br /><br />This book will take you on a emotional rollercoaster. There were a few times when I thought I might bust out in tears due to the heavy content. This subject matter is not for the faint of heart...the book weighed on me long after I finished reading it.<br /><br />However, I would encourage anyone and everyone to read it. Just like the Kite Runner, I felt forever changed by reading this. It reminded me of what life is supposed to be about...love and strength. If you are looking for a book that is informative and touching, I strongly recommend ATSS.

0812993292|3.0|Swinging from hope and despair, memories and regrets to opportunism and media spin THE UNLIKELY PILGRIMAGE OF HAROLD FRY takes us on a journey which poses many questions not the least of which is \\"Can we outrun/or outwalk what life has in store for us\\".<br /><br /> Within the first few pages, the reader feels an ominous cloud hovering over the main characters when Harold receives a letter from a woman named Queenie with whom he had worked at a local brewery many years before.  She informs him that she is dying of cancer and when Harold walks to a mailbox down the road to mail a short letter of sympathy and apology he impulsively decides to continue walking and deliver his message in person.  Early in his walk he meets a young woman and in talking to her becomes convinced that as long as he walks Queenie will live.  Why must he see Queenie and apologize ----- well that is part of the narrative of Harold's story that unfurls mile by mile as do the memories of his relationship with his wife Maureen and his son David.<br /><br />Harold is a quiet, non-descript loner beaten down by a life of abandonment and guilt.  During his insightful journey he seems to readily attract others who have a plethora of problems - some self inflicted and others occurring through no fault of their own.  I kept getting the feeling that I had met Harold before but was probably just visualizing him as a British Forrest Gump......only instead of Run Forrest Run, I was chanting Walk Harold Walk.  Parts of the story are a little too convenient and during the six hundred miles that Harold traverses on foot we are fed some pretty schmaltzy insights like \\"the world needs a little less sense and a little more faith\\", and \\"Judge no one\\", or \\"The world is made up of people just putting one foot in front of the other every day of their lives\\".  Metaphors too were in abundance.  Harold's loss of his compass or his being \\"adopted\\" by a dog who stayed for a short while then abandoned him are just two examples that come to mind.<br /><br />I will admit that the book did keep me reading, if for no other reason than to see if a couple of assumptions I had made earlier in the book were correct.  They were, so perhaps my other assumption will be also.  I assume there will be a fat check from a movie studio in author Rachel Joyce's future because as we all know there is nothing better than a protagonist facing adversity and coming out with a happy ending. (Forrest Gump again???)les that come to mind.<br /><br />I will admit that the book did keep me reading, if for no other reason than to see if a couple of assumptions I had made earlier in the book were correct.

0345803485|1.0|There are so many awful things about this book. I dislike everything about this book from the from the American characters saying British slang to the abusive relationship,between Anastasia and Christian. I would never ever recommend this book to anyone Not my Mother,my friends,Not even to a Walmart employee. This book would be an excellent guide for \\"How To Have A Terrible Relationship.\\"
B00846TTDG|5.0|\\"Act of Valor\\", at face value, is an exciting and well made action movie that stands well on its own, but take into consideration that it was made with active duty SEALs (with support of the military) and you get a very realistic look at the men and families that make daily sacrifices to protect the USA.<br /><br />No plot spoilers from me; the movie centers on the men comprising a Navy SEAL Team, the families and commitments they leave behind when deploying, and their mission to stop a terrorist plot from being carried out on US soil. The plot feels a lot like a good Tom Clancy story (he was involved in the making of the movie). The acting during the drama scenes was fairly stiff but really came alive when moving into the action scenes, as might be expected. The cinematography is actually quite good, with a lot of impressive shots of the Navy's biggest and best hardware (aircraft carriers, submarines, fighters, and helicopters).<br /><br />This is a movie I will be watching again in the near future.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

B006JSXYPA|5.0|Not just because of the 3D, but because this is the version where they made an effort to optimize the picture! They released this on blu ray like like avatar was released. First they release the movie without any optimization and special features. Which means the picture looks better than DVD but not the best that blu ray can be.(which means a grainy looking picture that looks like the characters are in a sandstorm and there is a lack of detail that you expect in a blu ray). The they make the limited edition which is made the way a blu ray is supposed to be down. So if you are wondering which one to choose, this is the one you want! All the features with the visuals to boot!
B008MEM24S|5.0|my 7yr old loves this game and so do I! its one for the whole family to enjoy!! we love it!
B000SLP4SE|4.0|\\"Shooter\\" is a very watchable action movie with fairly good acting and special effects to keep interest up through the few slower parts.<br /><br />No plot spoilers from me: The story follows John Lee Swagger (great name for this character), a retired Marine Sniper, that is asked to do one more seemingly beneficial job for the government. Obviously, things do not go as planned and he is soon the subject of a nation wide manhunt and Swagger needs to use his Marine Corp Sniper training to stay alive. There are quite a few plot holes and it is hard to believe that the experienced and powerful forces at work in the shadows could be so good at somethings and so very incompetent at other related activities, but that is where some suspension of disbelief is required.<br /><br />It would be easy to get drawn into harping on the few preachy parts and political cynicism that crept in from the time this movie was made (released in 1997), but I choose to just enjoy it as an action movie.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
B00634GHJA|5.0|I really like this app. It does a great job of transferring my photos from my Motorola Bionic to my Windows 7 PC. I got it as the free app of the day and I would gladly have paid for it if I hadn't. It is nice not having to hook up cables to transfer my photos.

B005DN7W4G|4.0|\\"Deep Impact\\" is a very watchable disaster movie that is less about action and more about the character development. Like all disaster and sci-fi movies, there is the requirement to suspend disbelief to fully enjoy the movie.<br /><br />No plot spoilers from me: The movie follows several characters as they react to news that a comet is heading on a collision course with earth. From the young high school amateur astronomer that makes an accidental discovery, a reporter that blunders into a big break and has a complex family life, an aging astronaut that has the fate of the world on his shoulders, to the president that has to decide how best to preserve our way of life, this is heavy on the drama and is even a bit of tear jerker.<br /><br />The acting was better than average, with stars like Morgan Freeman, Robert Duvall, Tea Leoni, a young Elijah Wood, and Vanessa Redgrave. The special effects were good for a movie made in 1998 and hold up well.<br /><br />Being a disaster/sci-fi movie fan I likely enjoyed the movie more than most might, but it is high on my lazy weekend movie list.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
B00843TZJ2|2.0|Whoever was in charge of mic levels on stage obviously was NOT paying attention.

B001AITGWE|4.0|The movie was GREAT! Would have given it 5 stars, however, wasn't able to do so in good conscious because of the following situations that I would be inclined to change:<br /><br />(1)  The female officer should NOT have been carrying a purse! She put her own safety at risk by doing so... it only got in the way. LOSE the purse!<br /><br />(2)  WHY...WHY...WHY did the ex-wife stopped for a snack during her escape from the deranged husband... as if she had been fleeing for miles and miles??  Not to mention....wasn't the party guest due to arrive shortly...and food was about to be served?<br /><br />(3)  There should have been more emphasis put on the fact that a fatal police shooting had taken place just yards away... rather than have party guests show up all smiles??<br /><br />Can you please forward the above comments to the previous movie director? Would love to discuss more on a possible film remake...Thank You!

0307352145|5.0|My favorite part of this book was Chapter 9: When Should You Act More Extroverted Than You Really Are? Cain presents studies about self-monitoring.  There degrees of self-monitoring.  I call it \\"picking your battles\\" and \\"getting along.\\" My husband calls it \\"selling out\\" and \\"failing to take a stand.\\"  After reading this book I learned that getting along is evidence of social style not a question of courage or ethics.  I am a high self-monitor and my husband is a low self-monitor.  It is a difference of style not an assessment of values or character. I look forward to reading more about this.<br /><br />This book shed tremendous light on why I was what my parents called \\"overly sensitive\\" and \\"thin skinned.\\"  As a child, I wept for weeks when we moved from one town to another.  The new schools and neighborhoods were so strange, dangerous, and frightening.  I was admonished for my inability to adjust quickly and take things in stride.  Now I understand that I was a very sensitive child and I would have benefited from more gradual introduction to new settings. I was ashamed of not being \\"tough.\\"  Now I know that I highly sensitive. I was my nature, not a character flaw. Thank you Susan Cain.
0060935464|5.0|Somehow, as many times as I have seen the wonderful film made from Harper Lee's novel, I never got around to reading the book itself until now.  How could I have waited so long?  But reading it was one of those odd experiences that made me glad I did wait, just so that I could have the great joy that comes with a first reading of a masterpiece.  Indeed, one of the reasons the film is so good is because the filmmakers had such strong material to work with (though it is not hard to think of films that have made a hash out of excellent originals).  This book is wonderful, and the film's fidelity to the book (language, story, feeling) only makes me appreciate the film more than I already did.  But forget the film; this is a book to be savored for its own sake.  There is not a misstep from beginning to end.  It's so powerful it actually brought tears to my eyes in places.  Lee's straightforward telling of an overtly simple story effectively lays bare both the innocence of a Southern childhood and the deep prejudices of the South in which that childhood was lived.  It's Lee's own innocence, her own childhood, and her own South in many ways, since the story, while not necessarily autobiographical, mirrors her childhood in many ways.  There is much in the novel that transcends the specifics of the plot itself.  One of its most powerful messages, delivered repeatedly by the wise and tolerant lawyer-father Atticus Finch, is that you must stand in another person's shoes for a while before you judge that person (and then you just might find that you can't judge them at all).  Contained in the consoling words from Atticus to Jem in the aftermath of the trial that is the centerpiece of the plot is one of the most generous indictments of injustice you will ever read.  (\\"Those are twelve reasonable men in everyday life, Tom's jury, but you saw something come between them and reason. . . .  There's something in our world that makes men lose their heads--they couldn't be fair if theytried.\\")  And that's what this book is: generous.  This does not mean that it is tolerant of prejudice, hatred, cowardice, and narrow-mindedness.  But it is generous toward human beings with all of their weaknesses and foibles, as well as all their nobility and goodness.  If you've never read this book, do so immediately.  If you have read it, you know that it is one to read again.

B0079XPUOW|5.0|I just finished reading 'Redshirts', John Scalzi's spoof on the television industry in general, and 'Star Trek' in particular. I won't rehash the plot here; the editorial blurb and other reviews explain what the book is about. Suffice it to say the book relies on 'breaking the fourth wall', where characters talk to their creators, and that it's chuckle-funny, not laugh-out-loud funny. This type of writing is not everybody's cup of tea. Breaking the fourth wall  destroys suspension of disbelief for some folks, but I've always enjoyed works written along these lines. So, I give it two thumbs up.<br /><br />Some of the other reviews didn't care for the codas attached to the end of the piece--I guess they either work for you or they don't. I really enjoyed them; they are really Scalzi's meditations on writing, living life, and love. If what you want is straight science fiction, stop at the end of the main story, about three-quarters of the way through the book. It's still a good read. But the codas add a level of poignancy to what was, in the main story, a straight-out romp.<br /><br />I read this one in an afternoon, and it was time well spent. Now I kniow what happened to all those Redshirts on 'Star Trek'.

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Having heard so much about these books from my kids I decided to read them myself.  I enjoyed the Hunger Games and Catching Fire but found this, the final book a let down.  It seemed to me that the book struggled to capture the magnitude of the epic battle that was to resolve the story.  Instead, everything felt a bit undersized and underscoped.  Unlike the first two books, I needed to force myself to finish the Mockingjay.  I didn't feel the engagement with the story I had previously felt.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I found this novel engaging as both a mystery and a psychological study. In fact, I can't think of any element which was in the least disappointing. The characters are well drawn out and believable and the storyline, although surprising and unique, is made believable by Gillian Flynn's expert storytelling.<br />I plan on reading more of Ms Flynn's work which I hope is as engaging as this novel.
B000WTNCYA|5.0|Fabulous CD!  Fabulous artist with a fascinating back story.  Her smooth sultry voice makes great background music for parties and my guests are always asking \\"who is that fabulous artist?\\"  Her first CD is just as good.  The latest album is a stretch and not my favorite but growing on me a bit.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|this game basically steals your money from the second you get it. also you must shut to get out IT SUCKS!!!
1416955070|5.0|I'm glad I got the whole series since the movie is coming out next August and I love the concept. The story is about Clary Fray who befriends a handsome boy named Jace Wayland. She finds out that shes related to these half angel like breeds called Shadowhunters that hunt demons. I got hooked to this book. Its fun and action packed and yes theres romance too. There might have been stuff that you could have seen from a mile away but I liked it nonetheless. I like that theres other creatures than vampires in the book. Theres fairys and wearwolves as well as the shadowhunters. You also hear how the first shadowhunter became a shadowhunter with drinking the mortal cup mixed with the angel Raziels blood and the human blood. I love the characters even Jace who can be a butthead at times, he was hilarious that I found myself laughing. SPOILER ALERT DON'T READ ON IF YOU HATE SPOILERS! What I didn't like was that at the end Jace and Clary find out they were brother and sister because I wanted them to be together and their father, also the villian Valentine escapes. But I can see from a mile away that they aren't going to be siblings because Jace is the main guy and they'll probably find out that they aren't siblings. I think this book is way different than Harry Potter and Twilight . For anyone looking for a new series or is a fan of fantasy I would pick up this series. I'm already on book 2 City of Ashes. I can't wait to see Lily Collins next year as Clary Fray!
B0083VP2KQ|5.0|I bought both the Blu Ray and DVD versions of this series. It is one of the best dinosaur shows yet to be produced. The effects were spectacular and the realism is yet another level, as technology allows for increased detail and even the superfluous, background is completely realistic. The chosen dinosaurs are some of the most desirable for a paleo / dino fan. Also this series is fine for younger viewers, as there is not too much extreme violence. While this may be disappointing to many viewers (as full out battle scenes are great), it makes it appropriate for all ages, while not automatically being lame because of this. They have found the perfect balance between the action  most of us crave and the interesting and entertaining scenes devoid of violence.<br />I could not recommend this DVD series more highly.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|What can I say?  I'm completely hooked. not only have I watched this (and Season 1) several times.  I have lent it out to countless friends who enjoyed it as much as I.  We plan on having a Downton Abbey watch party just before Season 3 starts in January to re-watch the final episode in Season 2 to remind us of all the great plot twists and stories.  So happy for PBS to have an Emmy nominated series as good as this one!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this game a lot. only problem is the games are a lot to purchase but that does encourage you to keep playing.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|So, I'm not normally a reader.  With so many other things to do, I just can't force myself to take enough \\"me\\" time to read a book.  Well, I didn't leave the couch today!  50 Shades Darker is downloading NOW!  To the reviews that trashed the book - seriously?  Did you really expect anything more than smut or fantasy?  Does everything have to be such an intellectual read?  Just because it's on the New York Times Bestseller list doesn't mean that it's going to increase your IQ.  Make another selection if you're look to walk away with some new found knowledge you can nonchalantly drop at your next social encounter.

B007VGXS8M|1.0|The idea behind this was great, but after playing it once, it would no longer open properly. Save yourself a buck and buy a different app!
B002BSHXJA|5.0|I don't really have anything to say about The Beatles music that hasn't been said by countless others over the years.  Besides, anyone considering buying this set is presumably already a fan, so gushing about how great the music is seems rather pointless.  But I will say that, given the choice, mono is the way these albums should be heard.<br /><br />Mono is how The Beatles and producer George Martin intended for their music to be heard, with the stereo mixes almost being an afterthought, and it shows.  Not that the stereo mixes are bad; the mono mixes are just better, richer, and more natural-sounding.<br /><br />It's hard to imagine The Beatles sounding any better than they do on this set, at least on CD.  The sound is clear, full, and rich without sounding compressed as many remasters tend to be these days.  The inclusion of the original 1965 stereo mixes of Help! and Rubber Soul are nice extras (though it seems to me it would have been more appropriate to include them on the stereo versions).  Kevin Howlett's essay detailing the importance of these versions and some of the differences between the stereo and mono mixes is a fun and informative read.  The mini-LP sleeves, complete with paper inner-sleeves, are also a nice touch.  The icing on the cake, of course, is the inclusion of the previously unreleased mono versions of \\"Only a Northern Song,\\" \\"Hey Bulldog,\\" \\"All Together Now,\\" and \\"It's All Too Much\\" from the aborted Yellow Submarine EP.<br /><br />However, this box set is not without its shortcomings.  The extended liner notes from the stereo albums are not included here (with the exception of Mono Masters), nor are the mini-documentaries.  Also, while the exclusion of the stereo-only albums isn't a big deal since they're available separately, it's a shame they couldn't see fit to include the three stereo-only singles on Mono Masters, forcing people to also buy Past Masters to get those three songs.  It seems obvious that it was the label's intention that people purchase this set in addition to the stereo albums, rather than instead of.  Still, it's great that these mono mixes are available, and I hope other bands from this period who haven't already done so follow suit.
1609611543|4.0|After my mother told me about this & how wonderful it was but she had to return it to where it was borrowed from I bought it for her as a gift. Unbeknownst to me someone else had heard her and bought it for her as well.  She loves the book but is sending this one to me. I have yet to receive it but because of my food allergies, gluten specifically I'm sure I will be very interested.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|This USB cord does not work as a USB device. It will not connect the information on my kindle to the computer or vice versa. This is the second replacement cord I have received for crumbling previous cords, but the USB part of it does not work. Do you not try this out before sending them to customers? I'm very disappointed in this particular product. The first one crashed my computer twice. This one does nothing but charge my kindle.
B0086700CM|3.0|ok so I purchased this app about a week ago and I was addicted to it then. Now this is sitting on the bottom in the apps sorted by recent. You better really really love to download it.
B00457WZEI|5.0|War Horse is a movie that must be seen and/or owned by anyone who loves animals.  While it does not faithly follow the book, it is a fantasic adaptation of the book.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|The game is very fun and entertaining.  I also enjoy the fact it requires some mental thinking and problem solving.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I really loved this at first. I still liked it on my Kindle Fire even though we never got the great update we got on my phone. But now I keep getting some stupid error that says &quot;Too many controls added to LayoutManager&quot; I was on 200 with some people and I can't play at all. FRUSTRATED!!!
0345803485|2.0|A friend of mine \\"gushed\\" over this  awful series,  so I caved in and bought it. I have wasted $30 on worse things, but just know, if you buy it, you are wasting your money and time. I ended up skipping over almost all of the sex scenes in books 2 & 3. Thus, I was able to end my pain a little more quickly. I have never read erotica before and I will not be purchasing anymore. I actually didn't  realize what it was!  I have to give the author props~ she wrote something that is selling like crazy...oh my!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Bought the trilogy and enjoyed all three. Really good love story, had me laughing and crying. It is not for ones that are offended by sexual content
0316044695|1.0|The \\"story\\" just does not make sense\\", for instance:<br />1. He is stuck under a large fallen tree trunk, a RPG lands next to the tree blowing it in half and off of him (how convenient) and he is not injured by this?<br />2. He escapes the enemy, which has surrounded him, when an RPG lands in his fox hole, the force of which blows him out of the hole (he doesn't know how far) to somewhere enemy can't find him (really, how convenient).<br />3. By his words he tumbles about 900 feet down a rocky mountain, doing back flips, with no more than a broken nose? And each fall his rifle is right there falling next to him, never to get caught in a tree or between rocks (how convenient).<br />4. I could never understand how he was never shot given the amount of fire power from the enemy and bullets ricocheting everywhere. The two times left cover to save his buddies lives, they got shot, he didn't (how convenient once again).<br />5. The goat herder story did not happen, how can he and his fellow seals not hear at least 100 goats rumbling up a mountain, especially when they are in quite mode, yet when he is scaling the mountain side after the battle, he can hear people stepping on twigs from 200 yards away. Just doesn't make sense.<br />6. His commander, after being shot about 1 hour into the battle, decides to use a cell phone to finally call for help?<br /><br />The writing, editing (if anyone actually did edit the book) is horrible. In one paragraph Marcus takes about how great his god is but in the same paragraph uses the \\"F\\" word.<br /><br />Complete fabrication, I stopped reading about 3/4 way into the book.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|its amazing!!!!!! How did I live my life without it???!!??!??<br />its so fun its so entertaining and fun!!!!! I love it!!!!!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|fun and addictive.  this game is very simple in the design but is very well done.  I enjoy it a lot.
0345529057|5.0|Great series, the TV series follows the series fairly well. A must read! If you like the books you will love the TV series!
031606792X|1.0|This has to be the worst book of all of the saga just because of the ending! A lot of people told me not to read these books, but I said \\"Hey, why not?\\" I bought them all at once and started to read them. They were okay, not really my cup of tea. However, I start reading the end of the final. So much was going on at once, all these vampires from all over the place is about to fight the strongest group of vampires ever. Bella learns her vampire power that can really hurt the \\"big wig\\" vampires from winning. A battle was to break any second. It was amazing! Then out of nowhere, Alice comes a long and everyone stops, and goes home. Nothing happens, no battle, no one killed, nothing. I was so mad with his book, I threw it across the room because I felt like I wasted so much money. I never watched the movies or anything else. I would never read another book that Mrs. Meyers writes.<br /><br />If you want to read some good books, Harry Potter and the Hunger Games series are were its at!

B008645YEE|2.0|I love Hans Zimmer's work and although the music itself, in this album, is not his best, in my opinion, it's still enjoyable - at least in those tracks where the recordings were not mastered with excessive volume levels.<br /><br />Unfortunately, several tracks suffer severe clipping - where the maximum possible gain (volume) that can be recorded in a 16-bit file is reached, causing a severe loss of detail and an overall loss of dynamics throughout the entire track.<br /><br />The following tracks were mastered with excessive gain:  3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, and 15.<br /><br />That's 9 out of 15, or nearly two thirds of the CD, ruined by poor mastering.<br /><br />So now we have to wait a couple of years (if ever) for someone to come along and remaster these recordings with reasonable gain levels.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I loved the book until King decided to use it as a vehicle for his political views.  While the message was not a dominant theme in the work, it certainly destracted from my otherwise total immersion in the story.  This would have been distracting even if I had agreed with King.
B00785P2QC|5.0|great. awesome, fantastic, amazing, stupendous and not sleazy at all that they make you leave comments. anyways... no mention of space city playground... that would be cool.
B00197U0DU|3.0|It may not be a classic, but if you are a true fan of any band, you want all of their music in your collection, especially from the beginning in order to track their musical genesis (nyuk-nyuk!). Personally, if I do exclude albums from a particular artist's discography, most likely it will be later work when they ran out of ideas and began to, ummm...suck.<br /><br />As for this album as a whole, to be honest much of it really reminds me a lot of early Bee Gees with an occasional pinch of The Moody Blues. Though I don't mind some of the Bee Gees early work, they weren't a band that cloned well. But from a historical standpoint to trace the artistic progression of Geneisis, it is a must have.<br /><br />FYI, if I could, I'd give it 2.5 stars...
B004UNNAIM|4.0|The stranger stands outside of the society. It is the small circle of our morality that forms the society. He finds the behaviour of the people around him displeasing. Mersault had a different view of mortality. He can't show his mourning over the dead mother. The dead of the Arab makes him guilty in the eyes of the society. They condemn him about his behaviour. Albert Camus had experience this situation on the shore in real life. He shows that moral and discrimination have a narrow gab. They are two sides of a medal. Freedom and liberality are mayor are mayor values in our society. In the book the society is not ready for this liberality. The concept of this book is like an antic drama. At the end Mersault takes the dead as an option because he is not ready to give up his freedom. He lives like that there is no tomorrow. Every day can be his last. He can't bear the nerds and the hypocrite society. This makes the stranger a brilliant novel of the genre of existentialism.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|very fun and entertaining I love playing the mini games my favorite is the aquarium game my favorite game in the world
0307744434|1.0|There are very few books I don't want to finish but this is one of them.  I had expected so much more from the hype.  All fairy tale......like.
B00884GR0W|5.0|The only reviews on here is comparing block story to minecraft. i would honestly have block story. so much more to do,GREAT. you can go on quests, slay monsters and capture hourses and other animals. You can go into deep beautiful caves or explore the ocean. you can also fly to lands above! this is a great game. i had mine craft in the past and its fun but i got bored fast. its eather you just build all the time on relax mode or you fight the same old zombies. block story really mixs it up and holds my attention longet! I LOVE THIS GAME! at first i bought the lite version but i couldnt save my worl so i bought this version. best $4.98 i have ever spent on a game!! and it looks great on my Kindle Fire!
B0063GORYU|4.0|Is a good game. Plays well and does not cause any issues. Do not have any issues with it. I would re-download of necessary.
B0002WZTOI|4.0|Still a  very enjoyable film, if you can ignore Tom Cruise and the lame plot. Great carrier deck footage and music. Brief though it was, another outstanding performance by Meg Ryan. Loved the edgy wardrobe and haircut on Kelly McGillis. With its high-energy beach volleyball and beautiful so. Cal coastal scenes, this film is also a wonderful memento of the legendary NWS in its famous Miramar days. Having moved to the Nevada desert years ago, the school is now out of public view. No more standing near the freeway at NAS Miramar watching those gorgeous jets blasting to and fro.
1400052181|5.0|I loved this book. For one thing, it totally brings the snooze-fest of science to life and makes it easy to understand. Historical in it's telling of the HeLa cells, and poignant regarding the family that was left behind.<br /><br />I have read other reviews of this book that felt that the family story went on and on. But when your story isn't told, when your mother dies when you are four and all you want to do is 'know who she was' this story helps you understand their frustration, and how the loss of a woman, for all purposes held her family together, it totally makes sense why this story needs to be told.<br /><br />To many times, science forgoes the issue of humanity at the cost of saving and healing it. It took this book to may bridge the gap. You can't have it both ways as the doctors and the family prove. Should the family have been compensated. I don't think that's the issue, but I understand why the family would think the way they do. There were companies that did profit, handsomely from the sale of their mothers cells. Cancerous, or not, their mother lives on and has saved many other lives. We should all be so lucky.
0345803493|5.0|I totally recommend this book. Now on to Fifty Shades Freed.  Oh, Christian....what an interesting character with so much history...I loved this book.

B008JH5CVS|3.0|This was just so so.  It had so much promise.  I liked the actors and I'm not sure where it fell flat.  I just didn't feel invested and never was sucked in.  This did have lots of action, but not the greatest special affects.  Watch this when it's free and you'll be satisfied.  Otherwise, maybe not.
0345803507|5.0|I was so sad when the trilogy was over.  I hope we get a book 4...I so enjoyed this series of books and I recommend it.  Such a wonderful story and I loved every minute of it.
B004RLN3QG|5.0|I rarely write reviews of music because music is art and therefore very personal.  I'm a big fan of Joe Bonamassa and I believe i have all of his recordings.  This album is one, if not the, best.  I have listened to this album (cd) probably 100 times or more and I just don't get tired of it.  I do skip a couple of songs routinely, but overall, this is an excellent album.  I highly recommend it and I feel this is some of his very best work to date.  I would also highly recommend him on his live shows.  I hope to see him around for many many years.
0307951529|5.0|I was referred to this book and found it to be very helpful for me to get another jump start on one if my ideas.<br /><br />Getting rid of the hang ups and the need for having everything perfectly aligned is what I need desperately.Ideas can die from over thinking and can become a very real thing, if not checked and marked. This gave me a quick road map to ask questions of others and get something out in the market place, instead of sitting on your head. Feedback is important and input for possible tweaking like this is shown to be critical in moving forward.<br /><br />I'll shut up now. Enjoy the book. It's a very quick read and b4 ready to write in out and highlight passages, because you will. Find out what ideas can work for you and what can play long term and move on them either good or bad.

B001V7YJMG|4.0|personally i think this one was a little better than the newer let me in, the story was about the same, the subs were not great but they didn't kill the flick, the acting was pretty good, if you have seen the newer version then you might not like this one,i say that cuz  there are no subs in the newer film, the movie is shot in higher grade film and all the effects were way better,i guess this one's for all the people that don't mind a lower budget film with a great story.
B0009P5YXO|3.0|If you're using this in a video, especially without any closeups, then this sonic looks just fine. Otherwise, you'll notice the huge seams running up and down the length of the body and telescoping end. The clear bit is actually painted silver closer to the lighted end of the sonic, and the wire inside looks more like black licorice. The build quality of it makes you want to make your own custom sonic instead.<br /><br />As others have noted before, the black cap on the ink end of the pen fits tighter than the ink nib fits into the body of the pen, so you'll inevitably pull the whole nib off when you're just wanting to take the cap off the nib. The nib/cap combo frequently just comes loose from the sonic's body as well, so you can easily whip out your sonic from a pocket or purse...and the nib/cap end isn't there.<br /><br />So when the sonic is retracted, you press the round button in the middle of the body. When extended, you press the button closer to the lighted end of the sonic. But when you extend or retract the sonic, its sound and light will be momentarily triggered in between both buttons. That's because the buttons are raised higher than the blue inset \\"trench\\" between them, so the trigger beneath is activated during the sliding motion.<br /><br />The whole unit itself is extremely light, and looks comically large in your hand if you plan on using it as a writing instrument in the office. And remember the loose nib/cap issue? Well, the nib and body often start shifting about and separating when you try writing, so you end up consciously trying to keep the whole unit together while writing.<br /><br />I haven't had any success finding any \\"bio\\" spots in the bathroom or bedroom, as other reviewers have. Maybe I should try it in a public restroom. Or maybe I don't wanna know...<br /><br />In all, this is really more fun just as a giant plaything. The pen part is nice to have, but the nibs can only be replaced by contacting the UK manufacturer in writing or by phone, so I plan on using them sparingly.phone, so I plan on using them sparingly.
0345444051|4.0|Arthur C. Clarke is indisputably one of the great sci-fi writers of all time.  Not only are his novels 2001: A Space Odyssey, Rendezvous with Rama, and The Songs of Distant Earth classics, but he had a brilliant scientific mind.  Based on a paper he published in 1945, he is considered to have been the originator of the idea of using satellites in geosynchronous orbit for communications.  Talk about a world-changer.<br /><br />Childhood's End is one of his early novels, and probably not one of his best, but it's certainly enjoyable.  The set up is familiar: an race of aliens parks their massive spaceships in the air above several of the world's largest cities.  They set themselves up as benevolent dictators, of a sort, sharing much of their advanced technology with humans, yet retaining a level of control.  Clarke draws similarities to colonialism, like England's colonial occupation of India.<br /><br />There are groups who resist the aliens' influence, but for the most part mankind enters a new era of peace and prosperity.  Hunger and war are eliminated, thanks to the new technology, and work is mostly voluntary.  No one has to work for basic needs; they just work at what they like.  Eventually we find that the aliens are in fact working for an even more advanced race which has their eyes on humanity, which is about to enter a new stage of evolution.<br /><br />The story itself goes downhill toward the end, in my opinion.  To me, speculation about interactions with alien races, the impact of technology on daily life, and cultural and historical futures are more interesting to me than the sort of mystical, fantasy story this turns into.  Despite that, Childhood's End is worth a read.  And get this: the edition I read had a blurb from C.S. Lewis!  Any book with an endorsement from St. Jack is OK by me!<br /><br />Clarke's brilliance as a writer and storyteller are indisputable.  Few have been as visionary as he.  Even though this is not one of his \\"don't miss\\" novels, it's still a great read.it's still a great read.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|This latest album by The Beach Boys brings back the memories of summers past. Their combined harmonies sound as good today as they did in 1962. I recently saw The Beach Boys in concert for their 50th anniversary  and I can tell you it was a wonderful experience! I hope everyone that is a fan purchases this CD. The guys haven't missed a beat. Listen to their new songs and you'll know \\"Thats why God made The Beach Boys\\".
B004ZISVWC|3.0|I rented this a while back from netflix and i was kinda expecting a ton of action but was pretty disappointed when i had to not only read subs but wait like almost an hour for a damn troll.<br />the real movie starts like an hour in, the trolls start to pop out and the action picks up, overall the film was good but in my opinion i wouldn't buy it.
0553801473|2.0|Right out of the gate let me say that I hated, hated, hated book 4 (AFFC), but respected the author's work enough to give it three stars, plus, the fact that I hated it because of its left turn away from characters I cared about is telling - I still care, I guess. So while I guess I hate this one less because we've turned back again, it gets 2 stars, because honestly, while I still respect GRRM's way with words I am utterly disillusioned with his ability to control them in creating context any longer.<br /><br />Let's just cut to the chase, GRRM didn't \\"have to\\" create two books out of one, what he \\"had to\\" do was let his editing staff cut out the trenchers of filler and get back to the meat of a very, very good story.  Alas, words aren't just wind, they're also cold, hard cash.<br /><br />But GRRM expecting us to buy that these two books just \\"had\\" to be published separately is somewhat of an insult to the intelligence of his readership.
0307454894|4.0|Our hero, Michael, first met Hanna, an older woman, when he became ill walking home, and she aided him.  After a prolonged illness, he returned to express his gratitude.  At that visit, he became enamored with her, and caught a glimpse of her changing clothes.  He became obsessed with her and fantasized about returning to visit her.<br /><br />He doesn't explicitly quote Jesus' admonition that if you look with lust on a woman you have committed adultery, but he refers to it in a classic justification for premeditated sin.  When struggling with whether to visit Hanna again, he asks, \\"Did my moral upbringing somehow turn against itself?  If looking at someone with desire was as bad as satisfying the desire, if having an active fantasy was as bad as the act you were fantasizing--then why not the satisfaction and the act itself?  As the days went on, I discovered that I couldn't stop thinking sinful thoughts.  In which case I also wanted the sin itself.\\"<br /><br />Granted, lust and the act of adultery are both sins, but there is certainly a qualitative difference between imagining the act and actually doing it.  Still, many Christians can relate to his quandary.<br /><br />In a later passage, as he observes Hanna's trial, he reflects on his generation's rejection of his parents' generation's moral authority.  Every generation has a sense of rebellion against their parents, but in their case, they see the manifest moral failure of the Germans during World War 2 and the years leading up to it. Whether they were active participants, passive approvers, or silent observers, Michael considers the atrocities of that era to reflect a lack of morality for all of their generation, so who can blame young people for wanting to distance themselves from the culture and mores of the previous generation?<br /><br />The age gap between Michael and Hanna is unnerving, but is essential to the story.  If such a thing can be looked past, once you do look past it, The Reader is a terrific read and brings up questions of moral culpability and ethical decision making in very interesting ways.ead and brings up questions of moral culpability and ethical decision making in very interesting ways.

B006RUJST6|1.0|Returned for a refund. Found the characters to be flat and uninteresting. This book had so many great reviews and I'm not sure why.  Read about 100 pages and after the big reveal found myself forcing my way through the book. Glad ebooks are easy to return.
B00155GDXC|4.0|As a general rule, I think it's a good idea, every now and then, to view the world from unfamiliar perspectives.  That's what I like about The Reluctant Fundamentalist: the opportunity to view American culture in general, and the aftermath of 9/11 particularly, through the eyes of a Pakistani living in the U.S.<br /><br />The book takes place at a cafe in Lahore.  Changez, a young Pakistani, sits down with an American, whom Changez suspects is miltary or an intelligence agent, and tells his story.  Changez grew up in Pakistan, but gets an opportunity to attend Princeton and lands a job at an exclusive Wall Street valuation firm.  He lives the American dream, finding success in a high-paying field, meeting a terrific American girl, on track for long-term success and wealth.<br /><br />But everything is shattered on 9/11.  Although he had done well in the U.S., and had no real reason for animosity toward Americans, he felt a sense of elation and gloating when he saw the towers fall.  He got a sense of satisfaction that someone more like himself and his countrymen could strike such a blow to the world power.  In the aftermath, he feels like people perceive him differently, viewing him with suspicion.<br /><br />If I place myself in Changez's shoes, pretending, for instance, that I have gone to Germany to study and work, then Americans attack Germany in a terrorist attack, and Germany retailiates, I can appreciate his mixed feelings.  When the U.S. attacks Afghanistan, Changez takes it personally.  Even if the U.S was wronged, were we always in the right in our responses?  Viewing history since 9/11 through the eyes of a Pakistani hasn't turned me against the U.S., but it certainly does make me stop and think, and consider the world from another perspective.

B0079XPUOW|4.0|I'm not normally one to review this type of book on Amazon - I don't think the text of a view is going to sway you one way or the other... you're either the type of person this book appeals to, or you're not.<br /><br />I'm an occasional aci-fi reader, although I prefer TV/Movies for my usual sci-fi 'fix'.  Perhaps because of that, I enjoyed the premise of this novel even more.  It has a clever plot device, it pokes fun at Star Trek much like GalaxyQuest did, and has several codas at the end that supply supplemental story material as if several of the 21st century characters had blogs.<br /><br />Enjoyed this book to the point where I'm now seeking out other books by this author.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Awesome book. very well researched. easy to read. a nice flow and tone to her writing. makes you want to study personality psychology. highly recommend for both extro and introverts...especially if you have introverted children.
1584282584|5.0|Photographers have a list of must have items for their kit, a fast all-purpose lens, 50mm and fast telephoto lens. This book should be another part of that kit if you use a flashgun. The book introduces amateurs and professionals with new ways and ideas on using flashguns, remote triggers, light modifiers and techniques to help get the most out of your equipment. Neil, does not hide his methods for taking great photographs, he explains what he knows well and in a simple to understand way for photographers of all levels of experience. The book is not as technical as some people would like but everything can be easily deduced by the more experienced photographer. A+ book.
030758836X|4.0|While my brother was visiting last week, I downloaded this book on my Nook after seeing it topping charts for weeks and getting fantastic reviews.  This was my first time reading a Gillian Flynn novel, and I must say, I'm sure it won't be my last.<br /><br />It is so unique for me to find a book that can grab me by the very first page, but this book did just that. Opening on the day of his wife's disappearance, you're instantly thrown into Nick's world and mind, witnessing the current events through the eyes of his failing marriage and changing opinions of his wife. This book was such an absolute roller coaster! Unfortunately, in my opinion, the ending was a HUGE let down for me.  I felt as though I had gone through this emotional journey and flip flopped back and forth over who I thought the killer was - and then - the whole story just dropped. Maybe some found it poignant, but I didn't. I just felt let down.<br /><br />However, considering how much I enjoyed the rest of the book, I'd be more than willing to give Gillian Flynn's addictive writing style another try.

Illmatic will be a classic masterpiece 100 years from now. Much love to the 5 boroughs of New York, because Nas is one of the few artists that make you feel nastalgic when you hear his music. Anyone from New York that lived there in that era can relate.

B007L3BMGA|1.0|I told myself I'd read this book from cover to cover due to its excellent recommendations but found I did not enjoy a single second reading it.<br />Don't ignore the negative reviews on Amazon- they're all true. The book is slow and repetitive. *flush* *gasp* *flush* *gasp* Not much happens. As an erotic fiction I thought it fails miserably. I have read so much better elsewhere. The sex scenes are mediocre, even the ones that are meant to shock you. There isn't much of a plot and the main character is downright annoying. She's naive and insecure, and pretty much everything turns her on. I found some things just did not add up- it felt like the fantasy of a 13 year old, and everything felt glossed over and sugarcoated. It is about as unrealistic as a novel that tells you that all prostitutes enjoy their job or that love can be expressed through violence and abusive relationships.<br /><br />Definitely not something I'd recommend to anyone.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it fun and addicting<br /><br />cant put it down it has so many choices to chose from and has challenge to some of the games on it and you have to play to unlock more games
0345803493|4.0|I was not too happy with the first one but found that I couldn't stop reading it. But I continued reading because I wanted to know what happenes next.  This book brings all kinds of emotions out of you.  At times (most of the time for me) you can't stand Ana because she annoying and weak but all that changes in fifty shades freed. And other times Christian can be too much.  If you are stuck on grammar then you cant enjoy the fact that this is a love story between 2 extremely different people that are completely crazy about each other.  The sex is just the plus. The bdsm which btw is not much of it is part of Christian past and he's willing to give it all up for his love. I Love the story.  I want my very own Mr. Grey.  I felt sad when I finished the trilogy. It really hooks you.<br /><br />I didn't give it 5 stars because the writing could have really been better.

0767836286|5.0|Before 9/11, this movie was unthinkable and implausible.  After 9/11, it's totally believable and possible.<br /><br />With all the security in place in this post-9/11 world, terrorists and their sleeper cells would more than likely hide in plain sight by passing themselves off as the perfect next door neighbors.  After seeing this movie, you'll be wondering about the soccer mom you see at the local ice cream parlor or the baseball dad at the local baseball diamond.<br /><br />The paranoid thought going through your mind will be; \\"Are they...?\\"
B007L6VR12|5.0|Best described as one part \\"A Christmas Story\\", one part \\"Stand By Me\\", and one part \\"Lord of the Flies\\", with an extra helping of young estrogen from newcomer Kara Hayward to help balance out all of the snakes and snails and puppy-dog tails. Confused? At the end of the day Moonrise Kingdom is a very unique movie, one that is worthy of the copious amounts of praise that is being heaped upon it.<br /><br />Set on a small, sparsely populated chain of island in the 1960s that has more boyscout camps on it than townspeople, a twelve year old boy and girl decide that even if nobody likes them that they love each other. They set off into the wilderness with a coon skin cap, bb-gun, a yellow pup tent, some french records, and a few stolen library books. When they turn up missing, their parents, the police, and fellow scouts set out to try to find them, even though in many cases they were the ones that drove them away in the first place.<br /><br />This is all done in a light-comedy, tongue in cheek kind of way, but because you end up caring about the characters so much the movie carries with it a fair amount of emotion. The funny scenes predominate, but there is also a lot of suspense towards the end when you realize the fate of the kids and the movie itself is entirely up in the air. It has been a long time since I've seen a film where I sensed it was about to end but did not know what was going to happen.<br /><br />Although littered with many well known stars for the adult roles, both of the leading kids are played quite well by unknown newcomers. Jared Gilman reminds me of Ralphie from \\"A Christmas Story\\", wearing thick glasses and relying on his Red Ryder as he tries to navigate the perils of both the wilderness and his tween years. He may be a little more take charge than Ralphie, having already taken Scutt Farkas' coon skin cap from the school of hard knocks, but you'll see many similarities. One of Kara Hayward's on screen brothers is also interestingly the spitting image of Ralphie's younger brother Randy.<br /><br />Hayward plays the female tween misfit in this backwoods Romeo & Juliet, and would remind you a little bit of Wednesday from the Addams Family if not for the fact that she wears all pink and carries a kitten with her instead of being dressed in black with a headless doll. But she definitely carries Wednesday's personality, dry wit and style. Whereas Jared Gilman plays an orphan, Kara's character comes from a dysfunctional family who makes her feel like she wishes she had none. When she tells this to Gilman he quickly responds \\"I love you, but you don't know what you're talking about\\". While sometimes seemingly vulnerable and filled with self doubt, her trusty pair of \\"lefty-scissors\\" are quick to leap into action when she's forced to defend her man against some jealous boyscouts who have played with too many GI Joes.<br /><br />While that may sound a little violent, this is all delivered in the very quirky tongue in cheek style of Wes Anderson movies. This is probably his most accessible work to date. It does not feel too highbrow, and does not come off like it is trying too hard. He has really created a movie that is incredibly hard to define, and the more you try to do so the more all of your efforts seem lacking; he's really made his own genre here, with a nostalgic light-comedy coming of age love story kitchen sink suspense backwoods adventure.<br /><br />Ultimately I can see some people describing this as a chick flick and others as a guy's movie. Both would be right.g image of Ralphie's younger brother Randy.<br /><br />Hayward plays the female tween misfit in this backwoods Romeo & Juliet, and would remind you a little bit of Wednesday from the Addams Family if not for the fact that she wears all pink and carries a kitten with her instead of being dressed in black with a headless doll.

B0007J404G|2.0|This is a relatively cheap printing, physically and otherwise, of the \\"Origin\\".  My version, at 454 pgs. and published in 1914, has a very small preface by Grant Allen, it does contain the main introduction by Charles Darwin himself, but leaves off his \\"historical sketch\\" of the progression of the printing of his book during his lifetime, and leaves out the glossary at the back.  Further, it does not state what edition it is, but I assume the first... Around the turn of the century, Darwin's theory suffered a temporary (academic) setback, which was due in part to fallacious theories of inheritance then held; yet with the adoption of Gregor Mendel's ideas, this changed, and Darwin's ideas were back in full vogue.  It took a little time though, naturally, and so, in 1950, for the World's Classics series, G. R. De Beer would write a new preface for what would be a reprinting of Darwin's final edition, the 6th, with \\"all additions and corrections\\".  If one is to purchase an old \\"World's Classics\\"  printing of \\"The Origin Of Species\\", be sure that it is rather the \\"De Beer Edition\\", therefore, and not any of the pre-1950 renditions.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />The above review pertains to this particular rendition of Charles Darwin's \\"Origin\\" only, and is not a commentary in any way on the intellectual work itself, that is, Darwin's arguments.
B005JPXLCU|4.0|My 3 almost 4yr old daughter was introduced to this series in pre-school and loves Mr. Men and Little Miss books! The books in this set are alot smaller than the orginal stories and much shorter versions with only a few pages each story. I did not see this in the description, so that's why I am giving it a 4/5 rating. Shipping came faster than originally predicted though! We will be careful what set we buy next, because the original stories are much better!

Honestly I couldn't care less about what happens in this book. None of the characters is remotely likeable or interesting. The main character is a cold killer. His employer is a guy who has lived so long he has turned terminally boring. His wife is the token &#34;hottie&#34; added in the mix as excuse for the usual run of the mill sex scenes. Add the usual mix of bad guys and you see how I didn't care if any of them lived or died. Then the plot: solve a homicide which isn't really a homicide because people can just hop from one body to the next, so the victim is actually alive and well. Mix in some cheap violence and sex and out comes this book.

B008NAFU9A|4.0|Her Sweetest Downfall , by Rebecca Hamilton<br /><br />Before reading: The day I finished reading `The Forever Girl' I had many questions in my mind about the queen-being pure breed, about Ophelia- why is she helping Sophia and many such questions. And when Rebecca told me that some of these questions will be answered in this novella I couldn't wait for it. Finally Her Sweetest Downfall arrived in my mail and I was so excited to read it to know more about the world that Becca created in the forever girl.<br /><br />After Reading: WOW!!! It was Fantastic, Amazing and Awesome. I am glad I waited for it and too happy that I was lucky to get the e-ARC thank you very much Rebecca. It was a perfect page turner for me from the beginning and it was able to keep me awake from my night sleep till I read the last word. Even after completing the book I was deep in thoughts making connections to the incidents and characters in the forever girl.<br /><br />Anyone (15+) can read this book even if you have not read The Forever Girl: Sophia's Journey (Forever Girl, #1).<br /><br />The world, the setting of Forever Girl is now clearer to me. The mission towards which Sophia took her first few steps in forever girl, for which she was selected has been in making many years ago.<br /><br />CHARACTERS: I was already introduced to the main character Ophelia in the forever girl. But there I didn't knew much about her and her reasons to help Sophia but in her sweetest downfall it was all clear I was able to connect to the story and her character easily. here initially she has been shown like any ordinary girl who no longer ordinary when the serpents mark on her neck which indicated she is the chosen one.<br /><br />Next lead to whom I was introduced was Ethan-the perfect male lead. Ethan is a strong character who is fully dedicated towards his mission that was given to him by Universe. He didn't let his feelings for Ophelia sabotage his mission. He is perfect Guardian and lover. (Ophelia and Ethan have superb chemistry)<br /><br />Other important characters include Robert, Queen Callista and Lenore.<br /><br />STORY: Beginning depicts Ophelia like any ordinary girl who works for Lady Karina. But everything changes when the mark of an ouroboros--serpent eating its own tail appears on her neck. And then she is been kidnapped by Ethan who has taken her miles away from Great Paxton (where she lives). Ethan reveals she is `the chosen one' because she has the ouroboros mark same as Ethan. She comes to know her mother is dead when she was making plans to meet her. At this point of story both Ophelia and I had many questions like why she has this mark and what does it means? Why Ethan has kidnapped her? Who Ethan really is and what does `the chosen one' means?<br /><br />As the story progress all these questions were answered and I met new characters who play an important part in the story building.<br /><br />This story has a nice pack of budding romance and action. The story flows smoothly and again I'll say Rebecca has amazing writing talent.<br />Now I am sure this series will be on my favorites.

0439023513|5.0|I won't even bother trying to put into words what I thought and how I felt about the last installment of the trilogy when another reviewer has already done so flawlessly.<br /><br />Many reviewers were unhappy with the ending, were frustrated they didn't get their happy ending. In fact, this book was rated the lowest out of the trilogy, but I found the ending to be phenomenal and very fitting. You cannot expect happy endings when war is involved, when you leave and have to face the reality of your situation and all the atrocities you've witnessed and taken part of.<br /><br />Katniss had started her journey by volunteering to take the place of her sister in this evil game, but she came out broken. Broken by everything she had faced, and had to go through. She came out and was expected to go back to society and live her life normally, but all she could do was survive and try and get rid of the nightmares. Katniss, Peeta, Gale and all the other characters are not one dimensional in the least, and they are far from perfect. There is no good or bad, they all have their strengths and weaknesses, and they all have their moments of victory and defeat. Even President Snow, the filthiest leader played a part in Katniss's final decision when he tried to make her see reason.<br /><br />Yes, the epilogue was slightly predictable, but life goes on. You cannot erase all that's happened in the past, or change it, you just move on from it. You build a life over it and hope for the best.<br /><br />Here's what A.R. Bovey [[ASIN:0439023513 Mockingjay (The Hunger Games, Book 3)]] had to say, and all I can say is, I couldn't have said it better myself:<br /><br />\\"When I first closed the book last night, I felt shattered, empty, and drained.<br /><br />And that was the point, I think. I'm glad I waited to review the book because I'm not sure what my review would have been.<br /><br />For the first two books, I think most of us readers have all been laboring under the assumption that Katniss Everdeen would eventually choose one of the two terrific men in her life: Gale, her childhood companion or Peeta, the one who accompanied her to the Hunger Games twice. She'd pick one of them and live happily ever after with him, surrounded by friends and family. Somehow, along the way, Katniss would get rid of the awful President Snow and stop the evil Hunger Games. How one teenage girl would do all that, we weren't too sure, but we all had faith and hope that she would.<br /><br />\\"Mockingjay\\" relentlessly strips aside those feelings of faith and hope - much as District 13 must have done to Katniss. Katniss realizes that she is just as much a pawn for District 13 as she ever was for the Colony and that evil can exist in places outside of the Colony.<br /><br />And that's when the reader realizes that this will be a very different journey. And that maybe the first two books were a setup for a very different ride. That, at its heart, this wasn't a story about Katniss making her romantic decisions set against a backdrop of war.<br /><br />This is a story of war. And what it means to be a volunteer and yet still be a pawn. We have an entirely volunteer military now that is spread entirely too thin for the tasks we ask of it. The burden we place upon it is great. And at the end of the day, when the personal war is over for each of them, each is left alone to pick up the pieces as best he/she can.<br /><br />For some, like Peeta, it means hanging onto the back of a chair until the voices in his head stop and he's safe to be around again. Each copes in the best way he can. We ask - no, demand - incredible things of our men and women in arms, and then relegate them to the sidelines afterwards because we don't want to be reminded of the things they did in battle. What do you do with people who are trained to kill when they come back home? And what if there's no real home to come back to - if, heaven forbid, the war is fought in your own home? We need our soldiers when we need them, but they make us uncomfortable when the fighting stops.<br /><br />All of that is bigger than a love story - than Peeta or Gale. And yet, Katniss' war does come to an end. And she does have to pick up the pieces of her life and figure out where to go at the end. So she does make a choice. But compared to the tragedy of everything that comes before it, it doesn't seem \\"enough\\". And I think that's the point. That once you've been to hell and lost so much, your life will never be the same. Katniss will never be the same. For a large part of this book, we see Katniss acting in a way that we can only see as being combat-stress or PTSD-related - running and hiding in closets. This isn't our Katniss, this isn't our warrior girl.<br /><br />But this is what makes it so much more realistic, I think. Some may see this as a failing in plot - that Katniss is suddenly acting out of character. But as someone who has been around very strong soldiers returning home from deployments, this story, more than the other two, made Katniss come alive for me in a much more believable way.<br /><br />I realize many out there will hate the epilogue and find it trite. At first, I did too. But in retrospect, it really was perfect. Katniss gave her life already - back when she volunteered for Prim in \\"The Hunger Games\\". It's just that she actually physically kept living.<br /><br />The HBO miniseries, \\"Band of Brothers\\", has a quote that sums this up perfectly. When Captain Spiers says, \\"The only hope you have is to accept the fact that you're already dead. The sooner you accept that, the sooner you'll be able to function as a soldier is supposed to function: without mercy, without compassion, without remorse. All war depends upon it.\\"<br /><br />But how do you go from that, to living again in society? You really don't. So I'm not sure Katniss ever really did - live again. She just ... kept going. And there's not really much to celebrate in that. Seeing someone keep going, despite being asked - no, demanded - to do unconscionably horrifying things, and then being relegated to the fringes of society, and then to keep going - to pick up the pieces and keep on going, there is something fine and admirable and infinitely sad and pure and noble about that. But the fact is, it should never happen in the first place.<br /><br />And that was the point, I think.\\"n we need them, but they make us uncomfortable when the fighting stops.<br /><br />All of that is bigger than a love story - than Peeta or Gale. And yet, Katniss' war does come to an end. And she does have to pick up the pieces of her life and figure out where to go at the end. So she does make a choice. But compared to the tragedy of everything that comes before it, it doesn't seem \\"enough\\". And I think that's the point.

0307956350|3.0|I really liked the book at the beginning, even with the changing views. That was something that I really didn't like at first and it never grew on me. I don't want to talk about the plot, since so many other \\"reviews\\" do, but overall, I liked the idea of the plot. I think the book would have been better without the switching back and forth of the viewpoint. It could have worked to simply have the story told from Kate's point of view, without the flashbacks, etc., especially since the \\"current time\\" sections were the worst written. I didn't like how helpless Kate was throughout the story, either. She had been in the CIA for so many years but she made so, so many mistakes, it was really odd. There was also no real resolution at the end. I was really disappointed with the ending. For one, I feel like the reader should have been with Kate through the entire thought process of meeting Hayden, etc., and her thoughts, and I also think that there should have been some resolve with her and Dexter, which there really wasn't. I would recommend it, I guess, because it was a quick and fairly fun read but . . . quite a few flaws. By the end, I was mostly skimming just to finish it.

B000VYX8PE|5.0|I am someone who is very picky about books. Bu as i sawthis one it was eye candy. I looked at it day after day and finally decided to buy it. I had made the best decision ever. I love the persanalities (sorry if it isnt spelled right.) of each child. Klaus the one i can mostly relate to he is a bookworm very inteligent for his age. Violet the teen inventor who can think on how to make anything of materials found amywhere. Then, there is Sunny the toddler who is inteligent and is a good thinker. I recomend this book to anyone even adults would like this. I as an eleven year old loved to read the whole series. Thamk You
030758836X|2.0|[[ASIN:030758836X Gone Girl: A Novel]]  I read many comments about Gone Girl and thought it would be a change from the more staid book club selections I recently read:  Pope Joan, Major Pettigrew's Last Stand and These is My Words to name a few.  The early pages of Gone Girl didn't initially grab me,  I persevered and got to the point where I couldn't put the book down.  I told friends how gripping the story was though the sexual references and language were a bit off putting. It  strongly reminded me of two sensationalized missing wife cases that have occurred in the Chicago area in recent years.  I finished Gone Girl fifteen minutes ago and I feel I have been had.  As other reviewers have pointed out, the ending of Gone Girl is totally unsatisfactory, thus negating all that has gone before.  I regret succumbing to the hype and best seller status of this book.  I gave this book two stars, because for awhile the book was completely riveting.  Then the merry-go-round ground to a halt.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Another great game from Big Duck!  I can't stop playing!  Oh yeah...it's addicting!!  Love the water sound effects!  Thanks!!!  :-)
1400069289|3.0|This book seemed interesting at first. But after the first few chapters I put it down & haven't picked it up again.  Simply didn't hold my interest.
B005J4TLN4|5.0|I'm not a big foreign film fan.  However, there are a few films which capture my attention and this was one.  The acting was actually VERY GOOD.  The storyline and premise were top notch.  This IS NOT - ET.  It's better because its a cross between ET and Critters.  The cast was top notch and I'll be looking for other films by them.
B00884GR0W|4.0|this is definantly worth the money... but there ate a couple glitches, for 1, the game freezes occasionally when you go mine in certain caves, 2, sometimes you cant place things down and have to exit the game and play again to place things again
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I got this game mainly because it was free. then after I started to play it I was immediately addicted. I play this game in between my shifts, at lunch breaks and before going to bed. it makes the time go by quickly and it also works the brain. awesome game. everyone should try it!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|starts off very easy but gets fairly difficult on larger grids.  very addictive and you can't beat free! five stars.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love it so much its sooo addicting so so so so so so so so so so so so so fun!!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was an excellent read. It kept my attention and left me wanting more at the end of book one and two. I would definitely recommend this book to others it is also good for book clubs.
B008MEM24S|5.0|If you love Phineas and Ferb you will love this game too! I cannot put this game down, it is fun, challenging, and hilarious
B001GZ6QEC|4.0|By now we've been trained to expect a franchise's second film to be its darkest.  This precedent was arguably set by Empire Strikes Back, which managed to end on a surprisingly bleak note for a blockbuster film.  This trend continued with Back to the Future Part 2, which brought us the terrifying Biff controlled Hill Valley, Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom, which introduced a heart collecting Thuggee cult, and D2: The Mighty Ducks, which placed our pee wee hockey team in the middle of geopolitical turmoil.  In this sense, The Dark Knight does not disappoint.  If in the first movie Batman struggled against questions of retribution and revenge, in The Dark Knight he confronts untethered chaos as embodied in Heath Ledger's Joker.<br /><br />The movie begins in media res, as the Joker's men rip off a bank housing the unjust enrichments of Gotham's mob.  The heist's \\"punch line\\" happens to be the fact that the Joker has told each thief that he should kill the others in order to cut down on the number of people who will eventually split the money.  The only thief who survives happens to be the Joker in disguise.  This is one of many robberies the Joker has committed, all of which targeted the holdings of Gotham's organized crime, a move so brazen that one of the bank's guards even asks \\"Do you know who you're stealing from?\\"  I think it is safe to say that the Joker does in fact know who he's stealing from.<br /><br />This string of robberies stretches back to Batman Begins where Gordon tells Batman that a bank was ripped off by a lunatic who left a joker card as his calling, which means that the heist that opens the sequel does a nice job of connecting both films.  The Dark Knight further maintains the global scope of its predecessor.  Gotham's mob community (who have sorts of inter-familial meetings along the lines of the Algonquin round table) are involved in an international money laundering scheme that stretches across the globe to China.  In one of the film's best sequences, Batman decides to forcibly extradite Lau, the head of a Chinese corporation that is in league with Gotham's underworld.  Not only does Batman glide from one Hong Kong skyscraper to another, but he also devises a way for to hitch a ride with an in-flight airplane with Lau in tow.<br /><br />The series of decisions that lead up to this abduction lend the world of Gotham some real life weight.  Like an episode of Law and Order, the district attorney Harvey Dent confers with Lieutenant Gordon in order to determine how best to take down Gotham's mobsters.  The two then decide to rely on Batman's ability to perform an extra-legal extradition.  The police procedural aspect to the film accomplishes something that we rarely see in the comic books which are often concerned with flitting from one action panel to another: presenting the Gotham as a living, breathing city.  It is certainly in-keeping with Christopher Nolan's goal of grounding the superhero film in reality, an objective that is often achieved on the level of aesthetics, if not often on the level of plot.<br /><br />The Joker pulls off a series of criminal acts that look more like thought experiments than traditional crimes.  He threatens to continue killing Gotham's citizens until Batman reveals his identity to the public, and when Harvey Dent turns himself in as Batman in order to calm an agitated public, the Joker attacks Dent's SWAT team convoy in a dazzling set piece.  Later the Joker will make Batman choose between the life of Gotham's one true hero, the law abiding Harvey Dent, and Wayne's childhood friend Rachel Dawes, graciously recast from Katie Holmes to Maggie Gyllenhaal.  And in the film's climax two ferries, one containing everyday citizens and the other criminals, must decide whether or not they want to blow the other up in order to save their own lives.<br /><br />All of these Sophie's choices could have easily come across as the product of a freshman college student's philosophy 101term paper, if not for the byzantine, contorted, and scene stealing performance of Heath Ledger as the Joker.  Despite the fact that Ledger's Joker only appears for a grand total of ten and a half minutes in the entire two and a half hour movie, he successfully hijacks the film.  I think it is safe to say that Ledger's performance would have received the same accolades even if it weren't for his untimely death.  Ledger frequently smacks his distended lips as if he is never quite satiated, and at times he moves in a waddle in what is some unknowable inside joke.  Perhaps the film's most iconic scene occurs when Joker swerves down a street in a stolen police car, stretching his head out of the window and enjoying the wind on his face.  It is in this moment that the Joker seduces the audience to his point of view.  For just a second we get to see the joy and absolute freedom of anarchic will.  I have always felt that a great portrayal of the Joker lies not in his body count (although there's plenty of that here), but in his ability to convince an audience that his form of freewheeling violence might be just a little enjoyable.<br /><br />As a villain, the Joker poses a problem that's distinct from the League of Shadows.  Where the League of Shadows was an ideological terrorist group bent on refashioning the world in their own image, the Joker is pure bedlam.  His reasoning is inscrutable and thus unpredictable.  Like in the best horror movies, a genre from which Nolan also borrows, the Joker is scary because he defies traditional Enlightenment notions of reason.  Where half of Batman Begins was dedicated to the origins of its title character, Joker is distinct because we are denied an origin story.  He does provide a shifting narrative of his scarred face, but he's an unreliable narrator switching out his traumatic beginning whenever he feels like it.<br /><br />If the League of Shadows represented Al Qaeda, then the Joker represents the anthrax attacks that followed.Where the Twin Towers attack was a sickening spectacle, the anthrax attacks only furthered America's belief that violence could strike any one of us at any time and was arguably just as influential in convincing Americans that it was a good idea to invade Iraq as the 9/11 attack.  To this day, it is still entirely unclear who was involved in the anthrax attack and for what reason.  As the Joker tells a mentally and physically scarred Harvey Dent, \\"If tomorrow I tell the press that like a gang banger, will get shot, or a truckload of soldiers will be blown up, nobody panics, because it's all, part of the plan.\\"  Likewise, Americans seemed perfectly comfortable with the idea of civilian and military deaths within a war zone half a world away, but the moment that our own sense of security comes under attack, then we readily sacrifice hundreds of thousands of innocent foreigners and thousands of our own soldiers just so we can open our mail in peace.<br /><br />The central idea of The Dark Knight, that we are willing to cross ethical lines when the personal safety of ourselves and loves ones is broached, is embodied in the character of Harvey Dent.  While we see shadows in the corners of Dent's personality early on--he is surprisingly tolerant of Batman for a DA--the film explicitly positions him as the opposite of the caped crusader, as a man who works within the system and still manages to put criminals behind bars.  At one point he is referred to as Gotham's \\"white knight.\\"  But over the course of the film Dent becomes tarnished.  He begins bending rules, even threatening to shoot a suspect in order to garner more information.  When the Joker blows up half of Dent's face, then he goes into full on Inigo Montoya revenge mode.<br /><br />Any fan of Batman knows that Dent is playing the role of Two-Face, one of Batman's most complex villains.  While I'm sure most moviegoers were happy with Two-Face's appearance, as a longtime fan of the comics I was a little disappointed in his inclusion as a second tier villain.  The character also got short shrift in the campfest Batman Forever (again, playing second fiddle).  Even at two and a half hours, The Dark Knight feels increasingly overstuffed (I haven't even touched upon the subplot of the Wayne employee who uncovers his dual identity), and tacking on Two-Face feels like there are too many balls in the air.  Besides, when will this great character get the full spotlight he deserves?<br /><br />In some ways The Dark Knight is a messier film than its predecessor, but it more than makes up for it by being a much more ambitious film as well.  Arguably the greatest improvement between the first film and the second is Nolan's increased comfort shooting action scenes.  This is apparent in a showdown between the Joker brandishing a machine gun and Batman on a high tech motorcycle.  The scene becomes a clash of wills, the Joker employing Batman to break his code against killing, willing to sacrifice himself to prove man's infallibility.<br /><br />The Dark Knight ends on a note of nihilism.  Batman must become the villain in order to maintain Dent's role as a hero, because otherwise the masses would lose faith in social and government systems.  In Nolan's world there's a deep distrust of the people.  And while he does suggest that at times everyday people might surprise us and make the moral decision, ultimately this is overshadowed by the central characters who give in to a code of no code.  It is this anti-democratic point of view that not only makes the film an intriguing in its own right, but also makes it a unique blockbuster.  What other multi-million dollar success stories are as critical of the type of widespread populism that makes the summer blockbuster possible in the first place?  I may not agree with The Dark Knight's view of the world, and at times its theorizing can be incredibly thin, but it is a rare big budgeted film that makes us question our own moral fortitude.

1400063515|2.0|Full disclosure: I haven't read the book. I'm only reacting to the sales pitch.<br /><br />It says, \\"It is unpredictable; it carries a massive impact; and, after the fact, we concoct an explanation that makes it appear less random, and more predictable, than it was. The astonishing success of Google was a black swan; so was 9/11.\\"<br /><br />Google's success was unpredictable and astonishing? Maybe Taleb was astonished, but I wasn't. The obvious need for a better search model in the 1990s made it crystal clear to anyone with eyes and a brain that Google would be a massive success the first time they saw that now-famous white Google search page, typed in a search term, and hit Enter. The results were SO much better than anyone, including Yahoo, had to offer at the time. How could Google NOT be a mega success?<br /><br />Search in the 1990s sucked. Search for \\"plumbers\\" and you would get ten results about patent medicines, get rich quick schemes, and fraudulent investment schemes. But do the same search on Google, and you got results about plumbers. The difference was like night and day.<br /><br />I remember the first time I saw Google. It was 1998, the year of its release as part of a doctoral thesis by Larry Page and Sergey Brin at Stamford University. A coworker at the mid-size insurance company where I worked showed it to me. We both worked in the IT department. When I saw it, my mouth dropped open. I knew then, even though Google was a few years removed from its IPO, that it was destined to take over the search market in a huge way. The difference in quality was THAT obvious compared to the search leaders of the time.<br /><br />The only way Taleb could conclude that Google's success was a surprise is if he had never used a search engine during the 1990s.<br /><br />9/11 wasn't predictable? On the contrary, it WAS predicted, by U.S. Congressman Ron Paul no less. He predicted it immediately after hearing George W. Bush's inaugural address, months before that horrible day when jumbo jets got flown by terrorists into buildings. The root cause was also known: massive U.S. intervention overseas, as Paul clearly detailed in his pre-9/11 remarks. It's just that the powers that be (and most Americans) didn't want to face the truth before the event happened. Even afterward, most Americans still refuse to face the truth.<br /><br />There may be something to Taleb's thesis, but his sales pitch fails utterly.
1603420398|5.0|Don't think this is just another granny square pattern book.  Edie Eckman has covered aspects of crocheting that no other pattern books manage to do.  The patterns are in full colour with double-spaced text throughout. This  makes it easy to read and even easier to find your place. All the patterns are printed both in word and illustrated diagram format.  Edie has thought of everything from a quick symbol chart, to many side bars titled `Stitch it' which have tips, suggestions and advice that isn't always obvious if you're new to crochet. Colour photos are clear and close-up  and some technique pages have been written over with highlighted marks to show  how that particular stitch should look. This is a bonus for those beginners who prefer visual  learning!<br /><br /> Not only does Beyond the Square Crochet Motifs have 144 individual patterns, but it acts as a stepping stone towards creating and experimenting with designs of your own.  After the introduction, which reads like you are sitting with the author and being shown the pitfalls and triumphs of learning to crochet, the book  is divided up into  a chapter on each geometrical numbered shape.  A colour image accompanies the written pattern and there's an alternate line drawn diagram.  The patterns suit all levels of crochet with some rather intricate designs in each section.<br /> The Appendix includes some polar graphs for those who wish to design their own motif, and tips for making non-circular motifs.  The Basic Crochet Stitches section after the Appendix has every stitch abbreviation with its text explanation (no diagrams here) and then the Index, which is last, is followed by a universal stitch key.  The pleasure of motifs is that they finish quickly giving rapid satisfaction and it's true - crochet motifs CAN be addictive!
0985114606|1.0|'Bared to you' was recommended as a 'must read' after the Fifty shades of grey. So, rather than spend my money buying the book, I decided to download a sample on my IPad to test the waters first. Needless to say, this Sylvia Day author ( or plagarist) if you like didnt even wait until she was well into the book to start copying everything from 50 shades! I read only a few pages of this sample until I got, quite frankly, peed off with the oh so similarities of FSOG. The writing was too overly descriptive compared to FSOG which was criticised for it's lack of descriptiveness and repetition. For EL James and her first book, it was great, and good on her for plucking the courage to put pen to paper and start writing. I mean come on, how many different ways can you possibly describe and orgasm???? She wrote exactly what it feels like end of. In conclusion to this, 'bared to you' quite frankly is a stolen piece of writing from FSOG with v few differences and has been swiftly deleted from my kindle on IPad.

B002UXRH10|4.0|Back in 2007, Rihanna broke out and released her epic monster #1 single 'Umbrella' and her successful album 'Good Girl Gone Bad'. The album was solid, upbeat, fun and had sufficient serious moments. It spawned more hits like 'Shut Up And Drive', 'Hate That I Love You' and 'Don't Stop The Music', all of them becoming top 20 hits. Its success made Rihanna and her label repackage the album with new songs in 2008 for the album's first anniversary with the name 'Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded'. For this release, Rihanna took a more mature adult image, cutting her hair very short. The re-release singles were a complete success, with the songs 'Take A Bow' and 'Disturbia' becoming both instant #1 hits and solidifying Rihanna as a pop artist. 'Take A Bow' showed Rihanna's new haircut and also showed a new side of her, with lyrics that talk about a guy who just played with Rihanna's emotions and always cheated on her. 'Disturbia' showed a creepy and disturbing side of Rihanna, which became the image she took for the album I'm reviewing right now. She also released 'Rehab' from the original album to close the era and the song and video show a serious Rihanna singing about an infectious relationship. The song together with 'Breakin' Dishes' from the same album were potential choices for the closing single, and 'Rehab' was finally chosen and in my opinion it was the right choice since it constrasts with the first video from the era, which showed a good young girl becoming slighly rebellious unlike 'Rehab', which shows an adult Rihanna touching serious themes. In February 2009, she was still promoting 'Good Girl Gone Bad' and was set to perform at the 2009 Grammy Awards and finish her 'Good Girl Gone Bad Tour' in Asia, but it all abruptly ended after the pre-Grammy Awards party. Rumors broke out that Chris Brown, Rihanna's boyfriend at the time, had assaulted a woman. This woman was revealed to be Rihanna and photos of the singer with serious injuries in her face were leaked. Thenews shocked the world and everyone was wondering about the future of the couple, if they would get back together, if Chris Brown was going to jail, if Rihanna was taking a break and all that. In March 2009, Chris Brown was charged with assault and making criminal threats. During that same month, Rihanna started to write and record new material for her next album. Jay-Z said that the whole world thought Rihanna was taking a break, but in reality she was ready to work on new material and even with the assault her plans didn't get scrapped. For this album, Rihanna took a new direction which was dark and agressive, with depressing songs and some upbeat but still dark and agressive tracks with a bad girl gone evil image. The domestic violence case also went on during that year and Rihanna had to testify and do some other stuff about it. In mid 2009, a song from the recording sessions was leaked and had the title of 'Te Amo' (Spanish for 'I love you'). This song had a latin sound and people thought it could be Rihanna's new sound for the album. The album was very known to be set for a November 2009 release, but for October 2009 there still weren't any confirmed release dates and people started to wonder if Rihanna was even releasing a new album. Then in mid October, out of nowhere Rihanna's website said 'The Wait Is Ova. Nov 23 09\\" and then rumors inmediately started with people wondering if that was the name of the new single or album and if that release date was for the single or the album. Personally, it's obvious that 'The Wait Is Ova' is not the name of the album and it's just a message literally meaning that the wait is over and the new material is coming, it's too stupid and dumb to say it's the name of the single or album. In October 2009, Rihanna shot videos for 'Wait Your Turn' and 'Russian Roulette', 2 songs that made the album's final cut. 'Wait Your Turn' was a buzz single to introduce the album and had a low budget video, while 'Russian Roulette' was the actual lead single with a violent music video. Both songs were released in late October and its videos were released in early November. During November, tons of info about the new album was suddenly made public and Rihanna promoted it a lot. After the album's title was confirmed to be 'Rated R' and the tracklisting and cover were revealed, the album was released in late November 2009 and I'll now review each song and give a conclusion:<br /><br />1. Mad House - The album's first track. This is the album's intro and lasts for a minute and a half. I love this intro, it's creepy, mysterious, epic and definitely defines the album. I give it a 10/10<br /><br />2. Wait Your Turn - The album's second track. This was the album's buzz single and 'Mad House' segues nicely into it. I instantly loved this song when I first listened to it, Rihanna delivers epic vocals and the song while it's upbeat it sounds dark, so it's one of my favorites. I give it a 10/10<br /><br />3. Hard - The album's third track and second single. This song is about Rihanna being evil, agressive and hard and shows this \\"bad girl gone evil\\" direction of the album. This is another of my favorites. I give it a 10/10<br /><br />4. Stupid In Love - The album's fourth track. This is a deep ballad about an abusive relationship, which is exactly what happened to Rihanna with Chris Brown. A creepy fact is that this song was written 2 days before Rihanna was assaulted. Unlike other ballads on this album, this one instead of sounding \\"deeply dark and depressive\\" just sounds like Rihanna's classic ballads present on her 3 previous albums, although the lyrics are still dark. I really like this song, it must be very personal to Rihanna. I give it a 9.5/10<br /><br />5. Rockstar 101 - The album's fifth track and fourth single. This is another agressive track where Rihanna sings about being a rock star. I love the rocky vibe of this song and I think this deserved more success (it peaked at #64 on Billboard Hot 100!). I give it a 9.5/10<br /><br />6. Russian Roulette - The album's sixth track and first single. Another dark song that incorporates R&B elements. The song talks about violence and Rihanna sings with all her heart and soul and I really admire that, it's another favorite of mine. I give it a 10/10<br /><br />7. Fire Bomb - The album's seventh track. This song didn't work very well with me, while Rihanna delivers nice vocals the production is not too special. I give it an 8/10<br /><br />8. Rude Boy - The album's eighth track and third single. This was the album's biggest hit in the United States mostly because it's the least dark song on the album. The lyrics may refer to Chris Brown, but I really don't like them too much. The production and vocals are amazing though, and its beats are really catchy. I give it a 9/10<br /><br />9. Photographs - The album's ninth track. The song at first starts sadly and it's evident Rihanna sings about her relationship with Chris Brown. Then the songs starts to become upbeat and then will.i.am starts to deliver his vocals (this song features him). At first listen I thought this song was great and I still do, but I hate will.i.am's vocals and this song could be much better without him on it. I give it an 8.5/10<br /><br />10. G4L - The album's tenth track. Now we have the album's most epic track in which Rihanna talks about being \\"gangsta 4 life\\". Rihanna's fanbase is called Rihanna Navy because of this song's lyrics (\\"We're an army, better yet a navy, better yet crazy\\") and that part of the song was also referenced in the special thanks of Rihanna's 2011 album 'Talk That Talk'. I instantly loved this song's vibe and it's my favorite on the entire album. I give it a 10/10<br /><br />11. Te Amo - The album's eleventh track and fifth and final single. This song has a different sound, it's still dark like most of the songs on this album but it incorporates latin music elements like I said earlier in my review. This is another of my favorites,probably because I'm latin and have loved this kind of music throughout my whole life. I give it a 10/10<br /><br />12. Cold Case Love - The album's twelfth track. This song is the most depressing on this album and is about Chris Brown again. The piano and violin played at the beginning really reaches your heart and makes the song very emotional. Then the song's production totally takes over and makes it epic. This ties with G4L as another \\"total favorite\\". I give it a 10/10<br /><br />13. The Last Song - The album's thirteenth and final track. This is literally the last song on the album, but I personally think it's weaker than the rest of the album's songs and maybe 'Cold Case Love' should have closed the album. A creepy fact is that a Rihanna fan called Karen died in a car accident in 2010 while listening to this song. I give it a 7.5/10<br /><br />Overall, this album is very dark and its songs touch deep themes and some are really depressing. This is not bad, but I think this album really needed a fun moment, 'Rude Boy' comes close to that but it's not enough. This album is still solid and is an important phase of Rihanna's life and career. An interesting fact is that this is the only gap Rihanna has ever had between albums ('Good Girl Gone Bad' was released in 2007 and this album was released in 2009). This album still doesn't get a 5-star rating because of what I said, but it surely rocks. Rating: 4/5 Amazon stars.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I intend here to delve into the film and discuss it on more than a superficial level. While I want to respect that many may not have seen it yet, and won't reveal what I deem to be major spoilers regarding the much discussed fate of Batman, my goal here is to discuss it on a level that will inevitably cause spoilers pertaining to the film and even its third act revelations (at least if you haven't read the comics), so be forewarned and avoid this review if you must. For those who have seen the film and may have come to this page, like myself, wondering what others thought, please read on and let me know your thoughts in the comments section.<br /><br />I have now seen the film three times, once in the Dark Knight Marathon after having viewed Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. The Second time was after having had some time to reflect upon the first viewing. Before the third time I went back and watched Begins and Dark Knight once again to see what weight they may have gained with knowledge of how the trilogy now ends. SO now to the review of Rises... which begins with how it fits into the overall trilogy.<br /><br />The Dark Knight Rises is a genius film in that it not only completes a trilogy it gives the previous two films greater meaning and provides characters and scenes in the earlier films with even more depth and levels. The plot goes back and provides new context that adds enjoyment and helps the trilogy feel more cohesive. This is especially true regarding Batman Begins, specifically  a scene that occurs at about the twenty minute mark of that film. Ra's Al Ghul is expanded upon and his discussion of his lost love now carries heavier emotional impact. Also, a revelation about what Alfred was up to during Bruce's early travels around the world before becoming Batman also helps add more emotion and new meaning to Alfred's conversations with Bruce throughout the first third of Begins, and even to conversations they share in Dark Knight. It is amazing that Nolangrew as a filmmaker during the trilogy and crafted a final film that rose above where he began, but even more amazing that he took the time to craft a finale that makes the entire trilogy stronger, especially the first installment. Scenes that were clearly crafted on their own initially now seem like they were crafted with this final installment and the trilogy as a whole in mind.<br /><br />The Dark Knight, especially its final scenes with Two-face, Gordon and Batman are given a greater weight because Rises shows us the results of their decisions and gives us deeper understanding of what Gordon was thinking during those moments. What the film relies on from the Dark Knight, aside from Batman taking the fall for Harvey Dent, is the grittiness based in our reality. Begins had elements of this but Dark Knight pushed the parallels between Gotham and our world even further. Heavier real world issues were seeded throughout that film and that continues perfectly and seemlessly in Rises (financial strife, terrorism, disillusionment with social structures, etc.). The sheer ferocity and insanity of Bane is clearly only made possible by the astounding portrayal of the Joker. The fight, shown in many trailers, where Bane first fights Batman in the sewers is frighteningly real and has been primed by the realistic hostage tapes and menace produced by the Joker. Dark Knight clearly prepared us for Dark Knight Rises, but oddly the film seems to relate more strongly back to Batman Begins in that it provides a more emotional connection. Overall though the trilogy as a whole feels completed by this entry, and though Dark Knight will always stand out as the most provocative (it was so unexpected and something we were so unaccustomed to), in an entirely different sense Rises also stands out as something unique and compelling.<br /><br />How does Rises stand as a film on its own? Most people seem to be speaking in favor of it. I obviously agree with them. A few people have expressed not enjoying it and have been received very poorly for doing so, I just want to say regarding that, let's respect that each individual is entitled to their opinion. I can actually appreciate their stance as my first viewing was more of an enjoyment and my love and admiration for the film only came through repeated viewings I had planned ahead of my first viewing, despite the dismay it caused my wallet. Dark Knight Rises has many levels when paired up with the previous two movies, but it also has many levels contained within itself. There was a lot to take in and I admittedly had to process it and put it into the proper intended context. There are a slew of new characters, there are huge time jumps, there is not a great deal of time devoted to characters we already know and there are several plot revelations saved for the third act.<br /><br />Ultimately the thing to keep in mind when watching Rises is 'A Tale of Two Cities'. The story begins here and it really is the best of times, it really is the worst of times. The entire film is based strongly on themes found notably in the classic Dickens tale. Nolan's love for the motif of doubles/dualities throughout the franchise never plays more strongly than it does here. For example, Bane breaks Batman after a crushing blow to the forehead of his mask. Batman later deals crushing blows to Bane by wailing on his mask. Both men only became known for putting on masks. Gordon is a jaded cop who got his hands dirty, Blake is an idealistic squeaky clean cop, Miranda Tate and Selina Kyle also play opposites in their positions relating to Bruce Wayne. Even the film's ending has a quote from Dicken's classic and I think it speaks volumes not only regarding the themes of the film but to the ending and the dualities I believe to be found in it. It is this kind of writing, courtesy of the Nolans and Goyer, that I believe finds the film \\"being received... ...in the superlative degree of comparison only\\".<br /><br />The obvious things are all done with the craft and capability one expects from Nolan's team. The directing is great in that is follows traditional patterns but breaks them at key moments for planned effect (the dropping out of any score during a Batman and Bane brawl makes the hits that much more painful for example). The music plays with themes from the previous films but Zimmer pushes it to a wonderfully operatic crescendo here. The acting is the best of any summer blockbuster (Freeman, Oldman and Caine deliver as alwas) and Bale seems most markedly improved (he's given arguably heavier material to work with here than in Dark Knight and has notably won an Oscar since then). All the newcomers (Hardy, Cotilliard, JGL and Hathaway) fit into the series better than anyone portraying Rachel Dawes ever did (sorry but I couldn't believe Holmes or Gyllenhaal in Nolan's universe). The writing is, as noted above, layered and well done if not slightly compacted due to so much happening.<br /><br />Some weaknesses, a proper review should discuss the good and the bad and the film does have some issues, at least for me. The villains (Bane and [as most fans guessed early on] Talia) were well crafted by the writers and actors, but their final scenes felt somewhat anti-climatic to me. This may just be due to the fact that they weren't traditional in the Hollywood sense. Bane is sent off ultimately, after an earlier defeat, rather quickly with a joke (though a successful one) made at his expense. Talia makes her exit rather quickly without a direct confrontation and without much of a fight, it is troubling in the sense that she only gets one monologue after her big reveal and then is gone. She is given greater depth by a revelation regarding her childhood but her plan is never really presented in context of her desires other than the classic desire for revenge. She also never seems as strong as her provided origin would have us believe she is. Another annoyance is a character's death by car crash (despite every other character seemingly surviving similar or worse crashes during the trilogy, Joker survived a semi flipping over for example).<br /><br />Another potential weakness, from my view at least, was that though Gotham was seen falling into despair and decay, there was actually quite little seen of its citizens coping with the horrors inflicted by Bane and the League of Shadows. The majority of the citizens reactions seem to be done in one montage at the beginning of the occupation. Other than their faces during this montage and earlier at the football stadium we are left to guess what life for the everyday citizen in the occupied Gotham is like. That said we do see how the cops and Wayne executives are surviving and a nice reaction shot of Selina Kyle watching the initial looting does provide a great deal of weight and context. Still, seeing more of the everyday men and women trying to cope or survive would have added more weight to Batman's eventual attempts to save them all, it can almost feel like he will only be saving the main characters because few others are seen in the city.<br /><br />The last big question in my mind, how does everyone seem to know when the bomb will go off? Sure Lucious tells Gordon, Blake and the cops, but Bruce Wayne arrives in Gotham not having spoken to any of them and he already knows when the bomb will go off too. Then Talia always seems to know the exact minute count despite not having even looked at a watch. To a similar but greater point, how does Bruce get back to Gotham, get back into the city when its cordoned off so well and find Selina all luckily on the day before the bomb goes off? Great timing but no indication that he's planned any of it. It's all very coincidental and glossed over, some quick nods to how it all came together would've been appreciated. Further his plan in the finale is still somewhat murky to me, he gathers the police force for the huge wall street battle royale but why didn't he try using The Batto fly in blasting away and take Bane personally, or using his stealth for that matter, there are many reasons he probably does this (can't take on an entire army at once) but he never explicitly states any and no one questions him.<br /><br />Debatable weak spots aside, the strongest part of the film overall upon repeat viewings is indeed the ending. What upon initial viewing seems to be a somewhat cathartic and happy ending reveals itself to be a multi-layered and ambiguous one. It is an ending that merits endless deciphering and inspires questioning while provoking thought. I won't put any spoilers in this regard as I don't want to risk anyone accidentally reading it, but I would like to discuss further with any willing participants in the comments or a discussion thread. A crucial scene at the end of the film and a few quick scenes as well as one crucial shot during the final climax all leave room for interpretation to various possible outcomes. Initially I went with the masses and believed Nolan had provided a more traditional and cathartic ending, but upon repeat viewings I think the ending is meant to be ambiguous, just as Inception was. Personally I am drawn to the darker more traditionally Nolan ending. What makes it so genius though is that fans/viewers can seemingly have it either way. Happy ending for all, or a more somber ending with seeds of hope for the future.<br /><br />That the ending can be interpreted so differently is a testament to the time, effort and genius Nolan and his team put into making this film worthy of the trilogy. I believe it is.<br /><br />This was not the film that we deserved, but its the one we needed right now. This is a far, far better 'superhero' interpretation than has ever been done. This is a far, far better trilogy than we have ever known. I want to thank you Nolan, even though you'd say we never have to, for producing/creating smart, big budget films that don't condescend to the viewer. Hopefully you've started something...
B005HWUCMC|4.0|When Rihanna released the dark album 'Rated R' in November 2009, it was a big change of sound and image compared to the critically acclaimed and commercially successful 2007 album 'Good Girl Gone Bad'. The bad girl went evil this time, giving dark views of love, emotions and talking about being hurt, heartbroken and other dark themes, which was understandable after her former boyfriend Chris Brown assaulted her in February 2009 (more info on this on the 'Rated R' review). The album was still well received by people, calling the album an effective heartfelt effort by the singer. The album was also successful, becoming her best selling album at the time and debuting and peaking at #4 on the Billboard 200 chart. However, the singles weren't so successful with the biggest hit being 'Rude Boy' which was the only single to peak at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Its previous singles, the dark and morbid 'Russian Roulette' and the strong 'Hard', were also top 10 hits. The following United States single, the agressive 'Rockstar 101', was a disappointment however, only managing to peak at #64 and the following single 'Te Amo' was only released in Europe. In my opinion, the album was very good and it showed a new side of Rihanna, but sometimes it was just too dark and in my opinion it needed a little more fun. Rihanna then said in February 2010 that while she liked her new album, with songs like 'Rude Boy', 'Rockstar 101', 'Fire Bomb' and 'Cold Case Love' being her favorites, her new material would be much more fun and upbeat and she also said she was at a lighter and happier side of her life at the moment. That month, she started to work on her new project that became 'Loud' and she told her producers Stargate and Sandy Vee that she felt great about herself and wanted a very positive and upbeat song to record. The song was 'Only Girl (In The World)' that eventually made this album's final cut and was its lead single. She listened to the demo and loved it instantly, so shechose it for inclusion before even recording it. The song was the inspiration for Rihanna to create her 'Last Girl On Earth Tour' in support of 'Rated R', with Rihanna claiming she loves the idea of being the last, the only girl in the planet and feeling free. She released 'Only Girl' in September 2010 after finishing the North American leg of her tour and the 'Loud' era started. I'll review the album songs and give my final conclusion:<br /><br />1. S&M - The album's first track and third single. It's a very upbeat song that will surely make you dance, but its dirty lyrics just don't work with me and make it weaker. I give it a 7.5/10<br /><br />2. What's My Name? - The album's second track and second single. This song is also upbeat and is also very romantic, it's one of my favorites of this album. It features vocals of Drake. I give it a 9.5/10<br /><br />3. Cheers (Drink To That) - The album's third track and sixth and final single. When I first listened to this song, I didn't really like it and thought it was very stupid. Now I really like it, except for Avril Lavigne's 'yeah yeah yeah yeah' that I completely hated since I first listened to the song. The song talks about drinking, having a good time and forgetting about negativity, which is a very nice message. I give it a 9/10<br /><br />4. Fading - The album's fourth track. At the first listen this song was nothing special for me, it was just passable. Then after listening more to it and discovering more the lyrics, it's my favorite song on the entire album. Rihanna talks about a relationship that just can't go on because it's just not working and it's falling apart, she says she has opened eyes and realized her partner is just fading away. This is the first album ballad (finally!) and in my opinion needed to be a single with a video. I give it a 10/10<br /><br />5. Only Girl (In The World) - The album's fifth track and first single. This is the lead single I've been talking about earlier in my review. It'sa very fun and upbeat dance song, in which Rihanna insists and tells her guy to make her feel the only girl in this whole world, claiming she will make him feel like a real man. Basically, a song about any girl wanting a special relationship with a guy. It's an amazing song and is also one of my favorites. I give it a 10/10<br /><br />6. California King Bed - The album's sixth track and fourth single. This song shares similarities to 'Fading' since both are ballads and both talk about a relationship that has problems that make it fall apart. The song was picked by fans in a poll made by Rihanna in March 2011 to pick the album's next single, where they could vote for this, 'Cheers', 'Fading' or 'Man Down' (the next track on the album). Personally, I would have prefered 'Fading' to win now since it's more emotional, but this song is also very good and it's more effective for Rihanna since it easily becomes familiar (I used to like it more than 'Fading' because precisely that song takes some time to be appreciated). I give it a 9/10<br /><br />7. Man Down - The album's seventh track and fifth single. This song was between the choices for Rihanna's fourth single and while it didn't win, it was still sent to radios in USA and a video was also made. This song is kind of dark and talks about Rihanna shooting a man and then being scared of the consequences of her actions. She also sings this song with a catchy and curious accent, which makes the song more interesting. This song is also one of my favorites and the video may be a reference to Chris Brown's assault on Rihanna in 2009. I give it a 9.5/10<br /><br />8. Raining Men - The album's eighth track. This song features Nicki Minaj and just like the critics say, I think they easily make chemistry. This song is very catchy and it easily became another favorite of mine. I give it a 9.5/10<br /><br />9. Complicated - The album's ninth track. Another song that shares similarities with 'Fading' and 'California King Bed', but now it's a little more different since instead of being a soft and emotional ballad, this is an upbeat song and instead of talking about a relationship that is stopping to work, it seems to be about a relationship that has never worked quite well, a complicated relationship in which Rihanna complains about her lover making it difficult to love him. At first I thought Rihanna sounded annoying, but the song has become a little more acceptable after owning the album for a longer while, but the song is still not perfect. I give it an 8.5/10<br /><br />10. Skin - The album's tenth track. This song has a more sensual element to it and Rihanna talks about wanting her guy to please her. Again, like S&M, the song's lyrics don't work with me, but it's not that bad because unlike S&M, Rihanna doesn't sing desperately for pleasures and for instance the song is more acceptable. The instrumental is so perfect and I prefer listening to it over the song itself. I give it an 8/10<br /><br />11. Love The Way You Lie (Part II) - The album's eleventh and final track on the Standard edition. This song is a sequel to the original hit of the summer 2010 'Love The Way You Lie' which is an Eminem song featuring Rihanna and shows a man's perspective of a dysfunctional relationship that just has cheats, lies, hurt and violence over it. Rihanna at first was totally against recording a sequel, saying that nothing could top the original. She later changed her mind and recorded this sequel, which features the woman's perspective of this relationship. I like this version more, since it's not so agressive and hurtful and instead it's softer and sensible. I give it a 9/10<br /><br />Overall, this album is still amazing, but I can't give it a 5-star rating because it lacked its \\"super emotional moment\\". 'Rated R' lacked its \\"super fun moment\\" and just had \\"super emotional moments\\", and with this album it's the opposite. While it has amazing ballads, it was not enough and while 'Fading' became emotional for me, it doesn't compare to 'Cold Case Love' from 'Rated R'. I would have probably moved 'Raining Men' or 'Skin' to 'Rated R' and taken 'Stupid In Love' or 'Cold Case Love' to 'Loud' to have more balanced albums, but overall it's still a very solid effort and I really admire how Rihanna manages to put this kind of albums together in such a short amount of time; between 'Rated R', 'Loud' and its follow-up 'Talk That Talk' there aren't gaps and they are put together in such a short time that at some point they overlap with the tours that end when a new album is already out, which has been the case with 'Last Girl On Earth Tour' (April 2010-March 2011) and 'Loud Tour' (June-December 2011). Anyway, this album is great and it's a significant and memorable evolution of Rihanna. Rating: 4/5 Amazon stars.

7811168359|4.0|I love this movie and this would have been a 5 star if not for the misconception of it also having an English audio, which it does not. It has English COMMENTARY under Audio. Still has English subtitles and worth the money.

After a period of time, music began again. I got up to see and it was the 11th track.<br />I am writing this on a gift CD because the one I ordered for myself was purchased too long ago on June 10. If I had not been so lazy, I would have found this out sooner.<br /><br />Thank you<br /><br />I am contacting my friend to see if she has the same problem.

B008ALAHA4|5.0|The magsafe to magsafe2 adapter is only $9.99 at the apple store.  Why are they asking more here?  I bought the adapter at the Apple store when I picked up my new MBPwRD.  If you like any Apple enthusiast, you will be in the store soon anyway.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I seen the commercials for this and thought I would like film but rarely see films until they are released into Blu-ray. I was not wrong, this movie was very good in my opinion.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Mr Martin is a genius.  His writing is hypnotic.  This book, second in the series pulled me into the realm.  I felt like I knew every Stark and Lannister and could hear swords and smell roasted mutton.  This book is so real in it's depiction of the dress and sounds and smells and the anger and violence.  I have never seen the series on television but can't believe it could be as good as reading George RR Martin's words and I will read every word he writes.  I tell everyone I meet to read this and I know everyone will love it.

B0034DGPEU|5.0|I read this book today.  I only meant to read the prologue but I could not put it down.  The story is so powerful and the characters to deep and real.  I found myself a part of their everyday life and felt like I've known them forever.  I am sorry I finished the book because it's ended but I am so very happy that I read this.  I feel warm with the memory of all those spirits that touched me so deeply.  Kudos to Ms Grissom.

B006LSZECO|1.0|I am sorry to report that I did not like this book.  It failed me on many levels.  The biggest being, the first three quarters of the book was a word for word repetition of a recent news story of a pregnant woman who disappeared and whose husband was convicted of the crime.  I'm assuming it would be inappropriate to use their names.  The book then takes a weird twist and goes really off with an unacceptable, illogical ending that left me cold and empty.  All the characters in the book thus far do a complete about face and become someone they are not in the beginning of the story.  It just disappointed and went flat.  I felt like I could have put my time to much better use than to waste on this book.  I certainly wouldn't recommend this book to anyone.
B0043ZDU1E|5.0|This is one of the 10 CD's I am taking when I am marooned on the proverbial desert island.  I've love Loreena McKennitt's music since I first heard her on an episode of Highlander.  I have a number of her CD's but this is absolutely her best, especially if you love Celtic music.  Coincidentially, some of my most favoriate all time songs are on this CD, sung in her special way.  If you like traditional Celtic music, this is a CD for you.  If you like Loreena McKennitt, this is a CD for you.  If you like both, this is definitely a CD for you.  Absent from this CD is her usual Mediterranean, Eqyptian, whatever influenced songs.  She also lets her voice go in a few places and we can hear how strong it is.
0345803485|1.0|I must say, I am very disappointed. With all the hoopla over this, I was expecting a good read, instead all I received was boring, repetative grammer. There is no character developement at all, the only person who is talking in the whole book seems to be from her point of view. Which is very weak I might add. I am a very strong woman, and the idea of anyone controlling makes my blood boil over. I really hope that there are not weak woman in the world who will read this book and go looking for someone like this. It took everything I could to finish this book and with a third of it done, I just couldnt take it anymore and skipped to the end. So very disappointing. Please save your ten dollars and find another author. Sandra Brown is a good start. I am not sure how this book ever made it past the editors.

1594203059|3.0|I definitely liked COLOSSUS, this book less.  In ways it was a pleasure to read:  Ferguson's wide-ranging learning holds your interest throughout.  But, though I ultimately agree with his argument, as an argument I found the book rambling and inefficient.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This book was more annoying than entertaining. I couldn't even finish reading it. It was the same thing over and over again. The use of \\"foil packet\\" instead of condom and \\"down there\\" instead if VAGINA made this book seem like it was written by a middle schooler. I got bored with it.
0345803507|5.0|I liked the book a lot. Yes, the characters are crazy and the plot is very fictional, but a good story all in all. Not for the weak at heart!
B005H29GSI|5.0|I bought this for my son for his birthday and he loves it! My sons are 9 and 7 years old and they find it fun and challenging. I also brought it for a friends 5 year old son and he loves it too!
B007U1FEJE|4.0|Contains 12 songs, ten are good and two are average. Has four slow songs and eight with a medium tempo. All have good harmony. The Boys don't sound like they are 70 yrs. old, and Brian uses his falsetto with quality. The sixth song \\"Shelter\\" is good enough to be a Hit and deserves to be on the radio. In the last two songs it seems as though Brian is saying good-bye prematurely. It's beautifully sad. There are no duds on this album, but I only wish there was a fast song.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is tons of fun of you like a little bit of a challenge. it just get harder and harder. at first I though it would be boring but it great!!!!!
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I've always been a little nervous about ordering items unless they are directly from the store. I love my new life proof case! It came in very quickly and it was in the original box. I would recommend this site to anyone, I'll also be a returning customer.
030758836X|4.0|I was immediately drawn into the story.  Very cleverly written with the two perspectives, and as one who usually finds stories like this contrived or far too easy to solve, this mystery was enthralling, but then there was the end....I felt there was just too much left to the imagination...wish it would have taken one more step forward...I have a list of authors who I feel cannot end a book properly and I hope I will not have to add this author to that list!
1933952806|5.0|I,m really enjoying this book on the Nikon D7000, it has helped me with the camera.  I recommend it to anyone who has the camera.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I read a few reviews on here before I finally decided to read the book. I had sworn I wouldn't but a friend said it was good and wanted to compare notes, so I did. Well I should have listened to the first review I read! This book was repetitive and had no plot. There was no character development and no plot. I forced myself to make it through the first book, but I will not be reading the second or third.
B007Y36K46|5.0|John Carter from the instant download is an excellent movie. The stream came out clear and fast. I was happy with the picture it gave me. This is one of those movies that surprise you.
B006TLFPKO|3.0|When I was looking to purchase Breaking Dawn, I was unaware that it was video on demand instead of an actual cd. I also did not get the option to confirm my purchase, just when I clicked, it was a done deal.
B007ZJDGXC|5.0|Safe House from the instant download is an excellent movie. The stream came out clear and fast. I was happy with the picture it gave me.

B008MEM24S|2.0|This app should be for free its the same as where's my water. where my water has more levels then this. don't get me wrong who cant love Perry but 1 penny away from a dollar its not<br />worth it. where's my water is the same price as this. MAKE IT FREE
B007STXHTM|2.0|Bought this for a snorkeling trip in Mexico and was a bit disappointed. The housing and lens worked great but after 20 minutes in the water the lens would fog up big time pretty much ruining any video I was taking.
B0086700CM|5.0|For people who seen my review for Temple Run Brave, as I had told you my friend also got Temple Run instead. Here are ten reasons to get it.<br /><br />1. No freezes<br />2.No force closes<br />3. No glitches<br />4. Finished game<br />5. Characters do no look like fairies<br />6. More characters<br />7. No ripoffs<br />8. Good enough quality<br />9. Scarier looking chasers<br />10. Fre
B000TYV3C6|5.0|Shipped right on time, as expected and came with the newer release versions of each movie even though I was expecting the older. Great product w/ a surprise and I'll take that! Appreciate that, oh wonderful sender.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Decent enough game collection but can't complete most of the free point offers on kindle fire due to them being on google play rather than amazon marketplace.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|very fun challenging will keep your time occupied way longer than you thought you would play for great app has many levels to attempt
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great game.  is kind of like zoo tycoon but has all off the characters from ice age contenital drift.  love it
B007RRFUHM|5.0|Great voice, with a wide range...  My 15 year old daughter wasn't happy that I had bought this album; apparently it's not cool to like the same music as your parents and vs.
0143039601|4.0|It is not polished, but the rough gems are in there.<br /><br />If I were to distill my impressions of The Dharma Bums into a single sentence, that would be it.<br /><br />As On the Road was an ode to Kerouac's friendship with Neal Cassady, The Dharma Bums is an ode to his friendship with Gary Snyder.<br /><br />For all his talk of bhikkus, Bodhisattvas and visions, what struck me as most authentically Buddhist was Kerouac's sensitivity to the ever-passing moment, his desire to look deeply into moments that may seem insignificant and reveal the beauty, joy and peace in such simple occurrences. And with what relish he describes his meals, travels, fleeting meetings with other people, animals, and nature!<br /><br />On the other hand, I found Kerouac's interpretation of Buddhism to be rather misguided at times. A bhikku is one who commits himself to monastic discipline -- in stark contrast to Ray Smith and Japhy Ryder, who were often chasing after pleasures of the flesh.<br /><br />No, it is not polished, but I would prefer to focus on what I appreciated about this book: his admiration for others, his dynamic descriptions of mountain climbing, his wonderful anecdotes about food and eating (he truly had a knack for making an austere meal sound divine). So much gratitude and love of simple things, so much childlike wonder.
B007R21JJK|4.0|if you have an old CD Rom with IDE port take care, becouse this MB does not have it. Despite of that, lots of USB3.0 and everything else you for normal usage. I do recommend.
B008MEM24S|5.0|you should get it :)  its the best on kindle fires. its just 99 cents.  good game.  you can get new levels for 1.99
B005HSG3VK|1.0|We bought three Kindle Fires and three covers.  All three covers began to fray on all edges within a week.  Very poor<br />quality.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book will play with your mind. Just when you think you have it all figured out, it changes, then changes again. The characters battle over who is the most twisted. It's a compelling read.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|It is an excellent app. It will not let me install or update and it is currently unable to input anything. Hope they fix that so I can get away from these stupid preloaded keyboards.
030758836X|1.0|I purchased Gone Girl on the recommendation of my niece.  She said it was fantastic and she's recommended other books that I've enjoyed.  Not this time.  Absolutely unbelievable.<br /><br />The first part of the book was slow...but I was told it would get better, so I soldiered on.  Second part of the book WAS better...or at least a bit more readable.  I kept waiting for the BIG REVEAL.  The ending was absolutely the worst ending ever.  No justice and I had a flashback to the television show Dallas and was HOPING that they'd both wake up and it was all a dream.<br /><br />There are MANY loose ends in this book.  With such an open ended conclusion, I can only think the author is working on a sequel.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I started this book thinking it would be a mediocre discount read and I'd be on to the next thing by the end of the weekend. In less than 14 hours, I was finished! I went from chapter to chapter without being able to put my Kindle down. I was so pleasantly surprised by the direction the story line took.<br /><br />The characters were believable, the story line was a big enough surprise, and most of all, I got lost in the story.<br /><br />Such a great experience! If you're looking for a relaxing, effortless read, I highly recommend this one!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I saw Adam's wife and parents being interviewed on the Mike Huckebee Show.<br />I purchased the Kindle edition from Amazon.com. Once I started reading I could not put it down.<br />Adam Brown never gave up!!!! His reliance on Jesus Christ for every step he took<br />was so profound and almost unbelievable. It moved me to tears. I purchased five more<br />hard covers to give to my sons and grandson. I hope Adam Brown's life will inspire<br />them in their journey through life.<br />I highly recommend this book to EVERYONE in need of a ROLE MODEL. NOT the Hollywood type.<br />I hope a movie will be forth coming.<br />Eddie Preijers<br />Tustin, CA.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I almost didn't buy this book because of the negative reviews - I am SO glad I decided to see for myself!  This book kept my interest from the first page until it ended.  Yes, I was a little disappointed how it ended - but that's not a bad thing.  Eagerly anticipating the next book!
B005LAIGSC|5.0|One of the best movie I have seen in years and I watch well over 700 movies a year...<br />The action in this movie is well done and the acting is oscar quality...
B0086700CM|5.0|who does not like temple run??????? u pepper who rated less than 4 wars do not understand life!!!!!!!!! I mean my mom has owned an I phone 4 years and she has had temple run since she got it. I have had no problems what so ever.now I even have on this kindle and no problems DUHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!! because this game has no problems but some people R just stupid
B001DPDVE8|5.0|This was a very interesting mix of cast and missions.  Will probably have to watch again when I'm not babysitting my demanding puppy.  A lot happening in a short time, really requires your attention....  Recommend....
0756407125|5.0|I'm not going to talk about the plot.  Instead, let me just say that I continue to be thoroughly impressed by Patrick Rothfuss's imagination and his amazing ability to put his ideas into very entertaining and easy to follow prose. His command of the English language is complete.  He takes Kvothe through five separately complete adventures and I never lost interest. I will have to admit that the ending is a little anticlimatic while each individual adventure had relatively good conclusions.  Except for that and the idea that I now have to wait for the next book,I don't think I have read any better books than these first two. Amomg my favorites are Dune, Lord of the Rings, and many but not all the books in the Wheel of Time series.
B000JQU4TW|5.0|What a wonderfull book. I Love  the classic's. There are plenty of great books written today, but the classic's are from other periods in time that show life in a different light.
B005K17RU0|5.0|works great on the kindle fire. like the map. easy to navigate.  the controls are simple.  I use the time lapse to see when the storm will hit
B006LSZECO|4.0|I couldn't put this book down but the ending had me really peeved. Really?!<br />This is still a brilliant book and I highly suggest reading it. No spoilers but what a fantastic read. Wish I could write an alternate ending though.
B00005JKG9|5.0|A singular motion picture.  David Mamet and the cast absolutely rule.  I have never seen so many great actors in one film who manage not to trip over each other.  My landlord loved this movie; he used to be a car salesman; he should know!
B003ES61EE|5.0|This is a very basic lens cleaner, but it does exactly what it's supposed to, and it does a good job. I don't let my camera lenses get very dirty, but this lens cleaner gets the occasional spot off easily. It's size is very handy for slipping in a side pouch too. Recommended.
B005P06AAO|4.0|Love this show so much! Very funny and relatable. The shipping was very fast. I was content, but I kinda feel cheated on because the DVD is a copy of the original one. At least have in the discription box that it's a copy... It works and looks the same but still I feel like I was lied too...not cool
034580404X|4.0|i personally loved the books,but the reality is that it's up to you to read them and makeup ur mind, mabie U CAN relate to them in some level, but mabie you CAN'T,keep an open mind when u read them and decided for ur self, who knows u migth discover that u like this kind of \\"romance\\".I would recomend this books to my friends to read!!
0425263908|5.0|Excellent book ~ I loved it!  I will definetely read the follow up books.  However, it is as if the author read 50 Shades of Grey then wrote her version.  Doesn't matter though, it was still a great read!
B00005V0X5|5.0|This album is one of the best albums that exsist and is so far my favorite album.  Came really fast through the mail (withing 72 hours of exiting it's location, I ordered it Memorial Day Weekened), and contains everything that Megadeth could offer with this album.  They are getting more fierce with what appears to be less protected with some songs such as \\"Rattlehead\\", which is blatant speed metal (this may even be the first speed metal song, it originally came out in 1985), and this album still leaves me speechless sometimes.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love it finally something I can play with my kids or with my husband and its challlenging to us all
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I think this is an awesome game.  If you get it now you'll have the pirate ship from the new Ice Age.<br />And if you click it it'll pop up a cool pirate joke.  This is one AWESOME! game and I think you should get it.  It should always be rated 5!
0525952616|3.0|While this was an entertaining read, the lack of any real explanation for why or how thousands of drones can just suddenly start wreaking havoc leaves the story feeling incomplete. All you get is just some nameless, faceless \\"they\\", that is out to get everyone. It feels like the author did not completely think through all aspects of the story.<br /><br />Also, like in my review of Freedom, I have a problem with using unnecessarily large type that consumes unnecessary pages of paper to make the book look longer than it really is.
B006XF5BTG|4.0|It is a well written book that makes a lot of sense and puts away confusion. I just have to see if the workouts actually work still.
0143039830|5.0|First of all the cover painting was so impressive. i know that there are a variety of covers in the same new york trilogies but i like this one the best. the cover made me feel like reading a mystery light novels. of course the Auster's work is definately better than those ones.<br /><br />And also the delivery was fairly good. im currently living in an asia-pacific area so it is sometimes hard to get products from the states. but the amazon didn't disappoint me it took no more than two weeks to get the book in my hands and there was no scratch or any unpleasants regarding the book.<br /><br />Thanks for this wonderful reading experience.
B005LAIIS0|5.0|...this is not. I am getting chills, literally and mentally, as I am just now watching The Grey. To say the least, I am getting terrified. When Liam Needing holds the makeshift torch to the dark, and only sees the wolves eyes, appearing set after set, CRAPPED MY PANTS. I really thought (SPOILER) the stewardess was just badly hurt, but the wolf was eating her alive. I wager to say this is about to be a hell of a ride. Check this one out.
B008MEM24S|5.0|great game!!!! My daughter and I think through the levels and it makes her think. Plus who doesn't love Perry the platypus.
B0042RUMH8|4.0|I really love this cd, unfortunately the plastic case was cracked when I received it.  It didn't affect the cd so I just kept it.  Wish it had been packed a little better though.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|I have loved this movie forever. It is just one that has to be watched every holiday season. Believing is what puts that magical feeling into your holidays.
0307592731|5.0|Loved this book! It was great following along in her journey physically and emotionally. Would recommend this book to everyone!
0316023744|5.0|When I ordered The Second World War by Antony Beevor I wondered if I would be getting yet another rehash of WW II. This concern proved unwarranted. After its arrival from Amazon I began the book and found it hard to put down.  In my opinion it is by far the best one volume hitory of this war in my extensive library of military history - very well written with more than enough new information and fresh insights for any WW II buff - a caution, however, while Bevor's The Second World War is a good read it is not a happy read
B0061S073A|3.0|I have an Autistic son who loves to push the buttons on my electronic devices. I've had to reload my Kindle Fire multiple times even though it's built in Parental Settings are set up. This App makes it  hard for even ME to get through!! It's security times 1,000!
B00005JMFQ|5.0|A favorite that I can and do watch over and over again.  And, one of the few movies I'd buy on DVD.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|playon leps. world is tuna nd very addicting u have a brest time and its a Kool way to play when ur bbored
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Open image screen just loops and loops and it never actually does anything.  I was actually kinda excited about this one.
B00846REIS|4.0|I totally loved this from beginning to end. I love that Eva has her own issues, but still has the strength to articulate her ants & needs. The secondary plot line is compelling in its own right. I'm as interested about the family dynamics of both main characters as I am about the love story. The sex is hot, but the backstories are the winners here. This isn't just a twisted fairy tale, butchered like 50 Shades. Much more & I loved it.
B008MEM24S|5.0|get it its awesome love this app so -I was having to watch a 2 year old so I got this app and love it
B00881VLCE|4.0|I love puzzles and was very excited to fing this. It's a pretty great app. I would definitely recommend to friends.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|There aren't many sequels out there that can surpass their predecessors, some are repetitive, even unnecessary but thankfully The Dark Knight is neither. Christopher Nolan once again brings us superb writing with breathtaking cinematography and special effects, everything you want but rarely get in a superhero movie. The story is a continuation of Batman Begins, with Bruce Wayne still fighting crime in everyday Gotham city with regulars like Jonathan Crane and irregulars like the Joker. While dealing with all of this, he's also balancing a double life at Wayne Enterprise, protecting Harvey Dent while simultaneously pledging his love for Rachel Dawes. This seems like a lot to cover during a movie, and it is with nearly a three hour running time, however Nolan paces the movie so well, the plot seems to slip by in an instant. Props have to go to the cast for their acting and dedication, Bale and Ledger obviously bring the heat and play off each other well, likewise Gyllenhaal brings her own spin to Rachel, playing an older, wiser version of the character. Special effects are also phenomenal, another reason beyond the many to buy blu-ray. These effects deserve to be seen in high definition, not only because of their clarity but because of their impact. Nolan's Batman series is filmed with grounded morals and dilemmas, character flaws and imperfections. He gives Gotham the gritty tone it deserves, and what many fans have been waiting for since Batman Forever.
B000059H98|5.0|I love Tank Girl! She has a crazy attitude but does show some very tiny soft spots in her personality. Funny, witty, stylish!! Anyway, i ordered some of the books that arrived in great condition. They arrived in the timeframe specified and i thoroughly enjoy them. I plan on continuing to add to the collection here and there when possible. I ordered this DVD some time ago before the books and i really think that Lori Petty did a great job of portraying her. Too bad they didnt make any more of these into movies...it would be fun to see what they'd come up with. The movie may seem to most to kinda be a little dorky....but thats the point! It should be funny and entertaining as i thought it was. So sue me for feeling this way...lol!
B004SNAEO2|5.0|One of the most thought provoking books I've read in a long time!  I will read more books by the same author.
030758836X|5.0|A friend recommended this book and it sounded odd. However, I read the first few pages on Amazon and I was hooked! I don't usually buy novels in hardcover but it was so fantastic, what could I do!  Ms. Flynn's writing is beautiful and she really knows how to turn a phrase. The story is addicting, but so the writing. Buy it buy it buy it!  You will not be sorry.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is so much fun, but as you get to higher levels, it is very difficult.  I have almost completed all the levels in the &quot;regular pack&quot;. I would recommend this to just about anyone.
B0077SGMXM|4.0|I've been craving this game mechanic since Scorched Earth (and Gorilla)!  It works great on my HTC MyTouch 4G (Glacier).  But I seem to have to start at the beginning each time, and when it gets hard, it gets really hard!
B0086700CM|5.0|hey u haters back off ok this is a great game so if like this game and u herd it was great so if u played ot before then get and don't let those stupid haters who gave it a one stars and plus u problely don't know how to work your known device sorry u sick at not making your device work thats sad
0062197258|5.0|This is an odd way to begin a review, but \\"Into the Darkest Corner\\" reminds me of when I used to go rollerblading (back when it was still cool). While rollerblading I would occasionally fall to pavement, and get what we (me and my friends) would refer to as \\"Road Rash\\". Road Rash was part scrape and part part burn - it was like having a raw nerve exposed. The \\"Road Rash\\" was compounded by the dirt and sweat that naturally occurred when you were rollerblading. The end result was painful and very raw, and it lingered for days. That is exactly how I would describe \\"Into the Darkest Corner\\" - it is like an exposed nerve... it feels dirty, it stings, and it lingers.<br /><br />  Elizabeth Haynes crafts a very graphic novel both in terms of it language and the details of the abuse that is described. I will not go into the details of the story, but the level of realism is remarkable. Haynes is able to rationalize the challenges of OCD, and the misery of sufferer. Think about that for a second... she rationalizes OCD...  meaning you begin to feel the need to exhibit the sample compulsive disorders that plagues our protagonist (Cathy Bailey). Remarkably (but maybe not quite as uniquely) you begin to understand the cycle of domestic abuse and the feeling of being trapped. This really is a powerful novel.<br /><br /> So far, I have described, \\"Into the Dark\\" as raw, painful, realistic, and intense - but most importantly it is very good. It is one of the few books that I have read this year that kept me up past midnight (much to the chagrin of my wife). It is a story that you simply have to finish - you don't have a choice - again, it is like an exposed nerve - it must be treated.<br /><br />Final Verdict - \\"Into the Dark\\" is a very good novel, but it is NOT for everyone. The story is very graphic, and once the movie comes out it will be rated a strong \\"R\\". However, if you can handle the graphic language and intense visual imagery, \\"Into the Dark\\" is a novel you will unlikely forget.<br /><br />5 Starsorget.<br /><br />5 Stars
B0054JZC6E|4.0|love the variety of games...something here for the whole family! most are easy to beat and few games can give lots of points so you can unlock next games and levels easy.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I love this game its awesome you need to get it right now I meen like come on samurai kills zombies
B004SYP5WC|5.0|check it all the time to see what bills are due. love it. does what it says. works great and have recommended to my friends.
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|Did not work on my kindle fire. Paid $3. something and it does not work. I had the app on another tablet and loved it. I kept trying to find a app that would work on my kindle. I thought if I paid for the app it might work, but no such luck.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|My kids love listening any chance they can get. This is a great passtime for the family. I make sure this is on all my amazon app store machines
B004QL7K8E|5.0|I love this movie. It's very good. This movie is so interesting and at the same time fun.<br />I don't know why people write bad reviews. Maybe they're too old for this type of movies.
B007BHFSZC|3.0|OK, what can I say about Europe & their latest opus...firstly, Europe was the band that introduced me to the World of Hard Rock/Heavy Metal way back in the mid 80's, so I can gladly admit to being a TRUE & RESPECTABLE fan of Sweden's finest Rockin' export act. Secondly I'm proud of all my Europe albums, in which I own every one including solo material & side projects & will continue to do so as long as these lads deliver the goods in years to come. Now to the latest offering 'Bag Of Bones' & why I only give it a 3 star rating.<br /><br />Whilst just about every Europe record delivers a blast to start the ball rolling, then continues to roll throughout (with the exception of a few tracks scattered within...then not everyone's going to enjoy every moment on an album), 'Bag Of Bones' to me personally was a minor letdown with the fact that I was waiting for the x-factor song/s that'd make me sit up & say \\"HEEEELLLLLLLL YEEESSSSS, NOW THIS IS EUROPEEEE!!!!!!\\". Unfortunately that just never happened. With continual spins on the cd player, I can start to appreciate certain tunes on the album, with songs like 'Firebox', 'Bag Of Bones', 'My Woman My Friend', 'Demon Head', & 'Mercy Me Mercy You' growing on me with every listen. But in saying that, WHY does it have to be repeated listens to capture my attention, for I personally believe if that's the only way to appreciate an album, it's soon going to sit on my shelf & gather dust without a thought it ever existed. Luckily I have the copy with the Japan bonus track 'Beautiful Disaster' which confusingly is better than half the songs that made the Worldwide release, so why Japan got that gem is surprising to me (no offense to the Rising Sun). I will go ahead & say though that one tune in which just screams perfection is the beautifully crafted ballad & album closer 'Bring It All Home' which just has me spellbound everytime I hear it.<br /><br />I do know that not every review is agreeable with every fanatic, but as stated I AMa long long longtime Europe follower & I just expected something a little more special from my second favourite all-time band (second to Whitesnake). For anyone wanting to hear abit of Europe in their second coming, I'd highly recommend 'Start From The Dark' or 'Secret Society', otherwise this is certainly an addition every Europe maniac should own.<br /><br />P.S. Try finding the Japan version for the bonus track 'Beautiful Disaster'. You won't be dissapointed.
B0063IH60K|5.0|its simple but great I use it to pass the time and it does that there is nothing I would do to make it better some times kiss is the way to go ( keep it simple stupid)
0307592731|3.0|I bought this book to read while on vacation, and it was a good choice for beach reading material.  It was very well-written and there were times when I couldn't put it down.  But there were also times when I couldn't bear to read anymore (especially when it came to her sexual escapades), and I jumped ahead.  The most enjoyable parts for me were her narratives about the trail itself (I wish there were more such narratives!), her issues as a novice hiker, and the people she met along the way.  Like some other reviewers, I, too, looked forward to the moment of her epiphany, and it was a bit of let-down when that singular moment didn't come because the sub-title and the early parts of the book refer to how the author \\"found\\" herself.  I also wish there was a bit more in the end chapter about what she did once she finished hiking the PCT; there's a very brief synopsis of major life events, but after following her on the PCT for 300+ pages, I would have liked a few more pages that explain how she re-adjusted to life off the trail, how she met her current husband, etc.<br /><br />Overall, the book is good, but not one I would keep on my bookshelf to re-read in the future.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|this is a great game. I really enjoy playing it in my spare time. worth the 0.99 you pay for it.
B008MEM24S|4.0|wheres my perry is not much of a diffrence from wheres my water. it is very entertaining and kid friendly and has the other characters voices inside which make it better.
B005C9YZKU|5.0|I don't understand the Limited Edition, Special Edition, Directors cut, Original version??? Can any one can explain???<br /><br />I wanted to buy this for a long time and got a good deal in Amazon.com, but don't understand these confusions...

B00338QENI|5.0|An amazing story about the woman whose cells gave scientists a foundation to build from.  It is a fascinating book that I hope becomes a staple in classrooms.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is totally awesome its fun for all ages you can move areas around so you can make more money
B006O6F932|5.0|I'm no stranger to large playsets.  My daughters have had several including the tower from Tangled, a Disney Princess castle (the Enchanted Tales hot pink one), Barbie's Diamond Castle and Dream House and others.  All of them have been big, bulky, hard to store and a nightmare to put together.  Monster High is the latest craze, and my soon-to-be six year old HAD to have the school to go with her dolls that she already had.  I knew what I was getting into... but was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />If you are worried about accuracy, Monster High School is meticulously detailed.  There's a locker area, a cafeteria and a school room.  It boasts a basketball court but the \\"court\\" is simply a hoop on the side of the school (and it comes with a black basketball!).  But the details are not the best part... when you first get it out of the box it looks kind of like a closed coffin, and not too big... but it keeps folding out and you end up with two good sized rooms (with floors!) and an upstairs area.  These houses without floors are ridiculous... and it was awesome to see that this would not be an issue with this set!  I was actually surprised at how big it is overall, and best of all - it closes right back up, locks up and even has a handle.  This can easily be stored in a closet, under the bed or behind a door when not in use.  It's not going to be a huge bulky play set.  I could even reasonably see them taking this over to a friend's house to play with after they have the knack of opening it by themselves!  The design is great, and I hope more companies will take a cue from design.<br /><br />Assembly is a cinch (there isn't much of one).  There are a few lights to hang, two moveable spiderweb lantern holders that can be moved around and clipped in various places, a pair of columns for the front with gargoyles... nothing too extreme.  The school is already stickered and ready to go!  It comes with a page of extra stickers but they are just for adding your own touches, the school has its decals on right out of the box!  Very impressive!  You can pop this out and the kids can be playing with it within minutes without hovering over you waiting for you to finish construction on the house.<br /><br />The only downside are the accessories.  It comes with a lot of them, but many have to be assembled, such as the cafeteria tables, the rolling cart, the benches (part of the \\"basketball court\\" I assume, but the kids use it for extra classroom seating) and two desks.  There's other goodies that are ready to go such as various creepy foods and classroom supplies.  The little working skull locks for the coffin lockers were another nice touch.<br /><br />Overall, this playset is a big hit.  There's plenty of room for lots of ghouls to haunt the halls and it's cute to see my kids practicing math and spelling by playing \\"school\\" with the Monster High characters.  Imagination is where the educational spin of this comes in, but for those kids that have it, they will actually enjoy using their dolls to teach one another and will be practicing skills needed for school without even knowing it.  If you were on the fence about this one due to fears about size or being unstable... then fear not!<br /><br />Positives:<br />+Very little assembly required (maybe 10-15 minutes to sort the pieces and snap the furniture together)<br />+Bigger than expected<br />+Nice decent build<br />+Not a bulky eyesore! Folds up for storage with a carrying handle<br />+It has FLOORS!<br />+Accurately depicts Monster High<br />+Lots of little details and accessories<br />+Reasonably priced considering what you get (bought mine from Amazon for $79.99)<br /><br />Negatives:<br />-The stairway to the second floor can be hard to lock in place<br />-The second floor could have used a column to help support it.  The stairs keep it from collapsing but you won't be playing with that level too roughly.<br />-Could have used another desk or two, but that's a minor quibble
031606792X|4.0|this book is awsome better then the movie but i did get mad about the second book replaceing bella as kinda the narator and putting in jocob i havent finished yet but..who knows it might be better with jacob so idk get one see whatcha think

IT WILL NOT SHOW ME ALL MY CARDS AND WHEN I TRY TO MOVE THE CARDS BLOCKING (SOMETIMES MORE THAN HALF THE HAND)  THEY WILL NOT MOVE OR IT PICKS A CARD AND PLAYS IT,  AND SOMETIMES IT IS THE WRONG CARD WHICH CAN CAUSE ME TO HAVE TO DRAW 6 CARDS BECAUSE THE APP PLAYS A DRAW 4 WHEN I HAVE 1 OR MORE CARDS OF THE CORRECT COLOR OR NUMBER!!<br />ALSO IT SOMETIMES HAS PICKED A CARD TO PLAY BEFORE THE 2 PLAYERS BEFORE ME HAVE EVEN PLAYED,  MAKING ME BELIEVE THE GAME ACTUALLY CHEATS. LIKE JUST THIS LADT TIME WHEN 2 PLAYERS GOT WAY BEHIND AND FOR 6 OR MORE HANDS THE LOWEST PLAYER WON,  NOW I ASK YOU, DOES THAT SOUND NSTURAL?  I THINK NOT. AND WHEN DOING THAT IT HAS AT LEAST 1 PLAYER PUT DOWN A DRAW 4 AND CALL THE COLOR SHOWING,  NOW THAT TAKES REAL STUPIDITY. BY THE WAY I WAS JUST PLAYING WHAT IT CALLS A QUICK GAME OR SOMETHING,  SHOULD BE CALLED PRACTICE AGAINST THE COMPUTER OR SOMTTHING.<br />NOW I SHALL REMOVE IT FROM MY KINDLE FIRE AND TRY TO FIND ANOTHER GAME THAT WORKS BETTER. OH AND THE OTHER GAMELOFT APP (FASHION ICON)  THAT I HAVE CONSTANTLY FREEZES AND CRASHES SO IT MAY BE AWHILE BEFORE I TRY ANOTHER BY THIS DEVELOPER!!!

0345535421|5.0|One Word: AWESOMENESS!<br /><br />This series is one best new fiction series out there. The best way I can describe this series is:<br /><br />A super violent, sexed up, twisted, riveting, way less boring version of Lord of the rings. NOW BEFORE  HARDCORE LOTR fans begin trolling; don't get me wrong, I love LOTR, its just that Tolkein's style is at times too slow and tedious (e.g. 5 sentences to describe a single blade of grass and a whole chapter devoted to describing a single field). Where as Martin has a perfect balance of story telling, character driven drama, plot twists, and details. Legit Martin has created his own new little universe where things like magic, dragons,drinking, whoring, wars and incest all create this crazy and compelling story.<br /><br />If you like good fantasy fiction: YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|If I had just one dollar for every time Ana murmured, muttered, or moaned over the course of just a dozen paragraphs, I could be refunded for the money I wasted downloading this. I have never read such poor writing in my life.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This series is just a fantastic page turner.  This last volume does not disappoint.  It is certainly well worth the time and effort to read this trilogy.  It is just a wonderfully well-written novel!!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This was one of those cases where I could not put this book down. The story was fantastic and being a product of the 70's & 80's I share the love of all the same things as the author. I'd also have to say this was one of the most \\"immersive\\" stories I've read in a while. Cline's writing style really makes you feel like you are there with the characters watching it all unfold. I can't wait to see if the movie deal comes through. I'll be at the opening if it does.<br /><br />Now if you'll excuse me I've got to go dust off the Atari 2600 and enjoy some memories.
B0062NAVXA|5.0|Well we have seen Fireproof but this movie takes belief to the next level.  The lessons are real life and certainly highlights the courage needed to live your belief with family and in the community.  I highly recommend this movie for its lessons, it's inspiration and quality of actors and production.  It is a beauty.

A huge waste of time!!

B0088RQ4X4|5.0|Great tempo and story, wish there was a sequel.  May have flopped at the box office due to poor advertising and trailer, but one of those movies that I think will continue to be watched by new viewers as popularity of the fans grow in places like Amazon.  I put the movie up there with Avatar, perhaps a little better.  Definitely will recommend it to my kids.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|trying to get this movie has been a nightmare for me.  i have friends that bought it for as little as $2 and i tried not to pay full price but the first one i purchased was defected and amazon refunded me-no problem-, but the 2nd one i bought hastily and it was blu-ray.  i bought a blu-ray because of this purchase and would you believe that my blu ray was defected?  when i returned the blu ray, I LEFT THE DANG DVD IN THE MACHINE! I am still seeking this movie because and it may sound like i am retarded and went through alot to get it, but no i am not retarded, but i did go through alot and will continue i think, but this movie is worth it! p.s. my son is retarded and in no way am i making fun of them at all.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|I went into this movie expecting... well, not the worst, precisely, but certainly mediocrity.  Wild horses could not have kept me from a movie with this cast, but I didn't expect much, knew all that could go wrong.  What I got was far greater than even my most optimistic hopes: this is a movie that delivers in almost all aspects, and does a lot of things that are incredibly danged hard to find anywhere in cinema these days.<br /><br />SWATH is not only a rebuke to those who cast aspersions on Kristen Stewart's acting, but a powerful demonstration that a woman can carry a fantasy/action movie just fine, thanks.  Snow is amazing, and while her partnership (however you want to see it) with the Huntsman is one of the most wonderful, understated parts of the movie (again, SO hard to find, and so good), *nothing that she does is for him*.  The same goes for Ravenna, the \\"evil\\" queen - these are women who have been shaped by the hard world around them, yes, but become incredibly powerful and take control for themselves.  That in itself makes this movie a miracle, and the absolutely breathtaking visuals are just a fabulous bonus.<br /><br />(Also, when I say visuals, I do not just mean costumes, creatures, and settings: everyone in this movie is a *babe*.)

B00466HN86|2.0|I always enjoy a movie about personal salvation and the ability to change, and I suppose that if religion is what's required to coerce some men to become better fathers then more power to it. Two things, though, that really troubled me was the patriarchal nature of the film and the corresponding female subordination, and the one father dictating to his daughter that it's his role to choose a proper husband for her.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app is fun and addicting!  My son saw me trying it out, and now he has it on his tablet too.  Simple concept, but it gets challenging.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Hands down, one of the best book I've read. Captivating, Exciting, Well written, I just couldn't put the book down. And when I finished it, first thing I did was checking whether they are going to make a movie for it. And yes they are working on it now - can't wait!<br />One thing I really love about this book, besides the interesting choice of narrator (death), superb story line, and great character development, is the fact that the story is 'complete'. My pet hate is spending some time reading a book, and in the end, my imagination is left hanging to wonder what happens with the characters. With this book, it tells me exactly how each character ends up to be. I finished reading the book feeling satisfied.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|Ico runs in 1080p native at 30 fps. It looks gorgeous and uses MLAA for jaggy reduction. Ico doesn't need much explanation. It is one of the most wonderful videogames I have ever played and still holds up today. In fact, it looks gorgeous and plays well. Unforgettable.<br /><br />Shadow, though, is kind of dated. I put my PS3 into 720p mode only because the initial resolution they have uses an upscaled 1080p mode with rectangular pixels and does not play well with the MLAA post processing method they use here for anti-aliasing. It looks.... okay. LOD transitions are awful just like the original and textures are completely untouched and awful looking for the most part. The bloom is totally overdone and the lighting is a bit garish but the game does have some soul at least.<br /><br />It runs well in 720p mode and gets a little worse in its set 960x1080p mode. No idea why devs think that a little extra fill rate looks better than true squared pixels at 720p but it really does not matter. The colossi are awesome the horse riding is okay and the camera is ****ing awful. Good game but it honestly cannot touch Ico in my mind.<br /><br />A full win for putting a backwards cover with the true Ico artwork on it. AWESOME stuff marketing guys.
B000Q9IZ5C|4.0|I like this movie a lot, even though I only saw about one-third of the television series episodes of \\"Firefly,\\" on which the movie is based.  The series translated to the big screen quite well.  Quality of video/sound is excellent, and the DVD has lots of nice extras, including director's commentary.  Without revealing any spoilers, the plot revolves around a big secret which the Alliance (which rules most of the galaxy) strongly wishes to keep secret.  A passenger on the ship may have the key to this secret buried deep within her subconscious.  Thus, an assassin from the Alliance is in pursuit...<br />Lots of action, good acting, nice FX, poignancy.  Worth the price!
1606995359|5.0|This is the second published volume of Fantagraphics Complete Barks series. It will be the 12th volume of the completed series.<br /><br />I'd gotten the impression that the series was going to present the stories in chronological order (although the volumes would be published out of order), but it seems like they've loosened a bit up on that promise for this second volume. This book presents the early Uncle Scrooge stories produced between 1952-1954. The ten page Donald Duck solo-stories Barks produced within the same period have apparently been moved to the adjacent volumes. Oh well, I'm not really complaining. Uncle Scrooge is a popular character, and I can see the attraction of producing a 'definitive' first Scrooge volume that includes the early 'origin'-stories*. This book certainly feels very much like a complete and attractive entity for new readers.<br /><br />The coloring is still excellent. There were some complaints about the yellow color in the first volume, and it's been tweaked a bit for this second volume. It's less 'golden', and there are no stories in which this color dominates too much. The coloring still sticks pretty much to the original coloring - which was mostly very good - and my only real complaint is that they've chosen to keep the inconsistent colors used for Uncle Scrooge's clothes (I assume this was done by different colorists for the original books). This was before his jacket had been established as being red in later stories. It's not a major problem, though. I'm nitpicking here.<br /><br />So basically this book presents some of the greatest comic book stories ever produced in an attractive no-nonsense manner which is slightly (and fashionably) 'retro' and mirrors the way they were originally published in the 1950s, but which should still appeal to modern kids. I approve!<br /><br />A LOOK AHEAD<br /><br />Based on me having borrowed the European Barks edition from my local public library, here's what you should (approximately) expect from the series in the future:<br /><br />- About 12 or 13 glorious five star volumes from the 'golden' era, in which Barks was on a roll, and pretty much every story was an amazing classic. I assume Fantagraphics will publish these volumes first, so you can expect pretty much pure gold for the next few years of publication. Best comics ever made! Seriously!<br /><br />- 2 initial volumes of early stories. These stick pretty close to the formula used in the Donald Duck animated shorts Barks had worked on previously. They frankly feel a bit slow and dated. But still... it's fascinating to see how Barks personal vision quickly evolved from this. And around volume 3 Barks starts to get REALLY funny and REALLY dynamic REALLY fast.<br /><br />- maybe 4 or 5 volumes (worthy of maybe 3 stars) in which Barks was experiencing creative burn-out (particularly around 1958-59) or was writing second-rate Junior Woodchucks stories for other artists. I assume the stories written for other artists will be published in the redrawn versions by the great Daan Jippes (these were redrawn a few years ago for the German/Scandinavian Barks Library), so the art will certainly be attractive enough, but these stories aren't particularly inspired efforts.<br /><br />- the rest (approx. 11 volumes) will feature a mix of classic stories and some lesser works, in which Barks was repeating himself a bit. I'd probably rate most of these volumes four starts or four-and-a-half-stars - the beautiful cartooning still makes them very much memorable.<br /><br />The volumes in this series aren't numbered on the spine, and each book works as a stand alone item. So if you aren't a completist or collector you'll be able to pick and chose between the volumes based on which periods you find interesting.<br /><br />*) note: the earliest stories in this volume ARE sort of 'origin'-stories, but only in the loosest sense of the term. They aren't the earliest Scrooge stories, but they define Scrooge as a new maincharacter for his own comic book series. They also include a few brief flashbacks to his youth.

0525423281|1.0|Lola and the Boy Next Door had big shoes to fill in my opinion.  After reading Anna and the French Kiss, I was in love with this author and her writing.  It surpassed my expectations in so many ways.  So when Lola and the Boy Next Door was released, I was hesitant in reading it.  I picked it up and put it back.  I eyed it from across the room.  I did not want to be disappointed and have it fall in the trap where second books fall.  I wanted it to be great like Anna.  Finally I caved and started reading it.<br /><br />I was right though.  Lola fell flat and it fell hard.  I will say that the writing was there and the author can write some amazing scenes.  You could read a paragraph and know it was written by Stephanie Perkins.  I think one of the main reasons I didn't enjoy this book so much was because of the main characters.  Lola was a spoiled girl that is being raised by two Dads.  I have nothing against gay parents raising a child.  Yet when two parents -- no matter the genre -- think it is okay for a teenager who is approaching adulthood dress like it is Halloween everyday makes me rethink their ability to be a parent.  Seriously?  They think it is okay to send their daughter to school in a sheet with a Cleopatra wig and eyeliner?  Lola was also spoiled and bratty.  I couldn't connect with her on any level.<br /><br />Then we have Cricket.  Oh Ms. Perkins.  Why? Why name a guy Cricket?  Seriously?  Then you step off the ledge and dress him like a dork?  Skinny short pants? Plus we have a plot of them growing to like each other when they were younger and the reason they separate is just laughable. I just couldn't see the reason being enough to cause Lola to act the way she does whenever his name is brought up.<br /><br />There were just so many cliches in this book that it made it unbelievable and worthy of eye rolling ever other page.  I know this author can write.  Anna and the French Kiss is proof of it.  I wish the author would take a step back before her next novel and go back to her roots in writing.  I desperately hope her next novel can reclaim her work to that spot in my heart that Anna is filling.xt novel and go back to her roots in writing.  I desperately hope her next novel can reclaim her work to that spot in my heart that Anna is filling.
B003H9MSPG|3.0|I'm a big foam dart gun guy, and I use them to make props for low-budget movies. Part of the fun of my props is that they can shoot, and my customers appreciate the extra functionality. But here's the problem; the Longstrike doesn't really shoot. Without the barrel extension, at an angle, yeah, it gets quasai-respectable ranges, but come on! This thing is a sniper rifle! Maybe I was naive to expect some real power out of this thing but frankly when the dart first dribbled out of the tip I was so disappointed with it. That said, it's a big, sturdy gun. Looks great, easy to load, an impressive breakdown of parts. Unfortunately, little things come in big packages. Get it because it looks cool, not because it works.

0345803485|1.0|Oh please do not waste your time with this garbage!! I do not know what has prompted this to be a \\"bestseller\\" it certainly isn't content. I actually threw this book away shortly before I was done; it wasn't worth reading or recommending. The sex scenes are certainly bland at best, I've definitely read better. Anyone who has been in a controlling relationship will not be \\"turned on\\" by this they will be repulsed. Completely unbelievable and sounds like it was written by a 15 year old girl, not a mature woman who has knowledge of the world (I would hope). I would never want my name associated with this sophomoric piece of trash. Do not spend a penny on this or waste your time that could be spent in so many better ways (sleeping perhaps??).

0307592731|5.0|Though I do not hike myself, I was totally drawn in by this memoir of a young woman who finds her self coming undone after a life fraught with emotional traumas,which culminated with the death of her mother at age 45. It is an amazing story of how this young woman ends up \\"saving\\" her self while going through a long and mostly solo trip through the wilds of the Pacific Crest Trail. A great read that mixes humor and a self revealing honesty that should resonate with most readers.

0393064476|4.0|After hearing the author on NPR as well as read several articles on this book I was quite excited to finally have the opportunity to sit down and read it. I am an avid reader of history and was looking forward to learning how Lucretius' poem On the Nature of Things helped to influence the modern world. Upon finally sitting down to read it, I had push myself through the first several chapters as we learned of the history of Poggio who is the one who rediscovered the book during a tumultuous time. While I found this interesting, the writing dragged quite a bit and did not pull me in. However, it obviously kept me interested enough to keep going. Once the author finally arrived to the point of Poggio's discovery of On the Nature of Things and began to go through the significance of the poem I could not put it down and read it all the way through. While the author does seem to make some broad generalizations and possible exaggerations on the influence of the poem, I found it quite an enjoyable read. I would recommend to anyone who reads this book though to not look to this as the sole source of information on Lucretius and his works, but rather as more of a pop culture high level view that requires more reading to understand the full breadth of his work.

B006LSZECO|3.0|I started this book over a month ago and it started out so slow, that I read 2 other books before returning to it.  The plot finally sped up.  The concept of a psycho wife framing her unfaithful hubby is blase.  I felt like it was part Twilight Zone & you've got to be kidding.  It was okay but as a bestseller, I wasn't dazzled like I expected.

B0085776BG|4.0|Excellent movie! Great cinematography! In addition to the message(the true story aspect), what I love about it is the action - nonstop almost. The actors were perfect for their roles. Terrence Howard, Cuba Gooding Jr., excellent. I love the time period & the props. I see it often...
B007H7XJD4|2.0|Can't stand blue people. Not even the chick from Farscape. These Titans had no individual personalities. That removes a whole star easily. What I consider a weak story with poor continuity-it seemed to almost go in reverse at times- kills another star. Zeus was an idiot and I couldn't care about any of the characters. That takes care of another star. The visuals were entertaining, but, I preferred 300 over-all. But, you go ahead and enjoy.

Of course she had no tongue, but, still... And yes, a 3rd star for the beautiful scenery when it wasn't blood-soaked. I'd give it another 1/2 star for Mickey the idiot (Noel Clarke), because I enjoy Doctor Who also. The details of the story held it back from a fourth star. Became very much like a muddled American western. Very much. Still, it was as expected. Enjoy.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|The boys in The MAZE RUNNER (MAZE RUNNER TRILOGY, BOOK 1 are so young but have adapted extremely well to the situation they have found themselves in (none of them have any knowledge about themselves before they got out of the box) and are trying to make the best of it.  Some of them just accept that they are where they are but some know that if they work through the tough stuff they will be able to get back to a life they 'seem' to remember as being normal but none of them can really figure out what 'normal' was UNTIL one boy thinks he has seen the new boy before he arrived. I am looking forward to the next book in the series.

B003WE9TU8|4.0|World War Z is a zombie apocalypse novel, written as a series of interviews done after the war is over. It's an original approach, but it means that there's very little tension in the book: we know that humans eventually win. That said, the book is very entertaining. It examines many of the social and political effects that such an catastrophe would have, and how society would respond. It speculates on how the zombies would be fought: what weapons and tactics would be employed, and how effective they would be (this particular variety of zombie is slow, but immensely strong, and hard to kill).

B0086213XW|1.0|I didn't even read the reviews for this film, thinking if Sarah Polley directed it, it had to be great. I'll try never to make this mistake again. I'd been saving it for just the right time to treat myself to an evening of pleasurable viewing.  Long, drawn out, and often seemingly pointless, I kept checking the time elapsed, hoping for the good news that it would soon be over. Mindless baby-talk (really?), a woman always wanting her husband's attention when he is least able to give it (literally)because he's laboring over a hot stove and one of them could be injured. She is child-like and childish in a not-at-all endearing way. She is too young to write this off to a mid-life crisis, and too old to be playing these kinds of games. Sarah Silverman was one bright light in this very dim picture and you have to respect Seth Rogen's character when he finally says his piece.  But the entire statement made by the film could have been reduced to a half hour, if that. And I found myself once again asking, \\"What's the big deal about Michelle Williams?\\" I didn't find her character likable and am not impressed with her as an actress with her listless mumbling. The entire experience leaves me with one final question -- to whom do I speak about a refund?
0345803485|5.0|Let me tell you that this book is a page turner for anyone ages adult and up. I really felt in the moment while I read this book.  Without giving anything away, this was my own personal \\"SATISFACTION.\\" What husband? Okay, I know that's not really what I want as the book describes from beginning to end.  Christian Grey really does have issues. Although I can fantasize how much his kinky, dark, sexual desires turn me on, that's as far as it goes. This has been a real page turner.....AND sorry E.L. James, but you REALLY left us no other choice, but to buy the second book.  I so cannot wait to watch the movie.  I am so saddened at the end of this book, but I hope that you, the author, believe in happy ending in book three. Otherwise, again, I just LOVED this book, and I highly recommend this book! (Note: With Emphasis:!)
0439023513|4.0|The final book in the Hunger Games trilogy....I have somewhat mixed feelings about Mockingjay, but it's hard to know where to begin. Katniss's celebrity status is more dominating than ever, with the whole nation looking to her as the symbol of the rebel movement. Most of her family and friends escaped the bombings in District 12, but the Capitol has captured Peeta, and not knowing his fate has left Katniss with a heavy heart. Her old friend Gale is often at her side, but recent events have changed them both, and their relationship just isn't the same as it used to be. To those around Katniss, it's clear where her heart lies, whether she knows it herself or not.<br /><br />The rebellion leaders' concern for Katniss's safety results in much of her time being spent underground (literally!), which not only adds to her gloomy mindset, but also causes the pacing of the story to be slower than the previous two books, especially during the first half. Several times I just wanted to light a fire under someone to get things moving a bit quicker!<br /><br />Unfortunately, Peeta's captivity in the Capitol causes him to not be present for a large portion of the book, and I have to say that I really, really missed him. Of all the characters, he has the softest heart and has always managed to bring just a hint of lightness and gentleness to the savage situations encountered in the past. His absence was deeply felt, and when he finally did make an appearance, I was somewhat shocked, disappointed, and very much saddened by what had become of him. :(<br /><br />Overall, I have to say I'm a bit disappointed with Mockingjay. It doesn't have the same spirit that was present in the first two books, and with Peeta's long-running absence, well, there was really no one left to bring a spark of humor, irony, or anything, to dull the horribleness of the events in their world.<br /><br />In the end, the long-awaited change did come to Panem, but not as much or in the way that I'd hoped. At this point our heroes are so beaten down, broken, and abused, both mentally and physically, that they barely resemble the people we originally met in The Hunger Games, which I find very sad. Now, despite my mixed feelings on the book, I will admit that Mockingjay is absolutely essential reading if you've already read the first two books, there's just no denying that fact. However, now that I've read it, I'm going to try to remember our heroes the way they were before...before the atrocities they both witnessed, and committed, left them as little more than empty shells, ghosts of their former selves.<br /><br />My Rating: 3.5 stars (rounded up to 4 stars for this review)s point our heroes are so beaten down, broken, and abused, both mentally and physically, that they barely resemble the people we originally met in The Hunger Games, which I find very sad.

B000G2YD3C|3.0|LOVE the music, but the CD I have sounds like it was recorded in 4-bit (or worse).  Almost unlistenable.  And that's too bad, because when they really let loose on Bight Ambassadors of Morning, it could really crack the foundations of your home if only it didn't sound like pure crap from the distorted mastering.  Rated 3 stars only because of the sound quality.  The music itself is absolutely wonderful.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great. app for studying the Bible. You can quickly switch between translations and paraphrases to see if another translation will make a difficult passage more understandable.  The reading plans keep you on track and the badges give you an extra incentive to keep on reading and since the creators recognize that people may fall behind for whatever reason,  they created a method where you can pick back up without making you feel you are days or weeks behind.
0307592731|3.0|There are parts of the story that are intense (boots) weird/interesting (frogs) incredibly moving, (the story regarding her mothers horse). But I expected more of an adventure, a little more immersion into the actual experience, instead you get a very self absorbed internal tale about someone who frankly is not very sympathetic. The writing is solid and I can see why there has been quite a bit of interest in this book, however, for me personally I did not find myself caring enough about the author to really get into the book they way that she intended.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|This case offers good protection for the device and screen, but isn't the thinnest or best designed thing. I do like the all-black styling.

B005LAIGYQ|5.0|This has been one of the better movies that I have seen in quite some time. You get a first hand look at the workings of Navy Seals.. This movie even had<br />some Seals starring in it. A Chechnyn terrorist has teamed up with a drug dealer named Christo. They haved abducted a Dr. Named Morales. Navy Seals stage a<br />rescue operation in Costa Rico. It is to say the least a running gun battle. The superiority of the Navy Seals is obvious. After the sucessful rescue of<br />Dr Morales American forces are able to gain more intelligance. The Seals also capture a mobile phone that tells all. They are able to gain the identity of<br />Christo who is trying to escape and retire. He is captured on a raid in the ocean. He reveals the plan of the Chechnyn terrorist. The terrorist plans to<br />commits acts of terrorism within the United States using special vests that will cause mass death. This group plans to enter the United States by going<br />through Mexico at the border. The Seals locate the terrorists and a huge battle breaks loose. The terrorists are being protected by the cartel. the skills of the Navy Seal are adequately shown. This border battle is quite a display. The ending of the movie is also very touching. Do not miss this movie. It is. It is one of the better movies that you will see.

0385341008|4.0|Why write a review when a book already has 1,634 reviews? I will because I enjoyed this glimpse into what life might have been like for these islanders during German occupation of their homeland in WW2. I loved \\"84 Charing Cross Road\\" and this had a similar feel. I liked in this book the idea of a literary society being a constant in the lives of people oppressed by hunger and loss. I only gave it 4 stars because it was difficult for me at first to figure out what the relationship was between these characters who were writing to each other. I like reading about books and history so that made it a plus. The romance was a bit predictable but I enjoyed it.

The book is designed to help you keep your professional edge well-honed, this latest edition covers all new and proposed changes to the NHS including non legal remedies, capacity and consent.<br /><br />This well-established work contains everything you need to help you lead your cases confidently through court.  Indeed the amount of new material (since the publication of the previous edition) is truly massive and as a consequence, the book has been extensively re-written by a learned and expert team headed by Andrew Buchan, who has been chosen by Charles Lewis -- who edited the first six editions -- to carry on the  editorship of this current volume.<br /><br />As the publishers point out, this new edition contains a number of useful precedents to include the most recent model directions, instructions and draft agendas.  Significant changes in general guidance and legislation are all incorporated, notably detention under the Mental Capacity Act 2005... the Court of Protection... and the effects of the NHS Redress Act 2006.<br /><br />Issues covered in case law include, to cite only a few examples: causation in negligence... consent to treatment... human rights and clinical negligence... damages... costs... expert evidence... terms of duty of care... funding and detention under the mental capacity and health legislation.<br /><br />We can only agree with Laura Cox, who, writing in the foreword, refers to this edition as `an informative, readable and comprehensive account of the current state of play in relation to every aspect of clinical litigation.'<br /><br />As expressed in the book's introduction, this is `a fascinating subject' and we would add - a subject in a continuing state of change.  Most useful, then, will be the copious research resources contained within the book's more than 800 pages.<br /><br />In addition to the logically organized table of contents and detailed index, there are extensive tables of cases, statutes and statutory instruments followed by -- rather intriguingly -- a short, but selective and apposite list of quotations on this broad subject, from everybody from Shakespeare to Voltaire (incorrigibly sarcastic) to Lord Woolf.<br /><br />If you're in any way involved in clinical negligence cases, this book, which covers almost every aspect of this litigation, should be in your professional library.<br /><br />We have in mind not just barristers and solicitors specializing in medical law, but the judiciary of course, as well as doctors and NHS legal advisors who will undoubtedly regard this lucid and accessible book as a vital tool.  The publication date is cited as at 12 March 2012.oreword, refers to this edition as `an informative, readable and comprehensive account of the current state of play in relation to every aspect of clinical litigation.'<br /><br />As expressed in the book's introduction, this is `a fascinating subject' and we would add - a subject in a continuing state of change.

0415579600|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2YLZCZ0QZW7NI]]<br /><br />DO REFUGEES HAVE THAT RIGHT?<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />To say that this book is a formidable work of research is a colossal understatement.  For starters, the book contains a bibliography of no less than 38 pages. It attests to the mind-boggling amount of papers, books and learned journals the author, Anneke Smit, has had to examine over the course of a decade in order to produce her scholarly, thorough and carefully argued thesis on the thorny, distressing and virtually intractable problems faced by refugees the world over, particularly with regard to property rights.<br /><br />An assistant professor in the Faculty of Law at the University of Windsor, Canada, Smit has also apparently spent some time in the areas under discussion in the book, including, notably, Georgia/South Ossetia and Kosovo.<br /><br />Fundamentally, the right to `return home' to your own property after you and your family have been forcibly evicted as the result of war, or political conflict - has been upheld (at least in theory) by the world community, as exemplified in the 2005 United Nations Principle on Housing and Property Restitution for Refugees and Displaced Persons.<br /><br />But, as Smit points out, initiatives like these have been largely ineffectual.  Indeed, she asserts that 'this focus on return and restitution of property has come at the expense of supporting effectively local integration and resettlement as possible durable solutions.'  She therefore explores the alternatives which, in a number of instances, might be preferable, including settlement and integration into a new community, or country.<br /><br />It's perhaps unsurprising that this extensive research originated in Canada.  And it's doubtful that there is any individual living anywhere in that country who does not know an individual, or family who originally settled there after fleeing in terror from somewhere else.<br /><br />For example, after World War II, there were at least 3 million displaced persons, or refugees in Europe, many of whom were able to emigrate to North America, but as far as it is known, received no `restitution' for their seized property.<br /><br />What the author accomplishes admirably in this book is to re-open the discussion and debate on this almost insoluble problem, focusing on the more recent experiences with post-conflict restitution and return.  The situation in a wide range of countries is examined, including Israel/Palestine, Cyprus, Cambodia, Mozambique, Tajikistan, Rwanda, Guatemala, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, Timor-Leste, Georgia/South Ossetia and Iraq.<br /><br />Since the publication of this book, other refugee problems have, unfortunately, emerged, including the thousands of refugees who have poured into Turkey to escape massacre or incarceration under Syria's murderous regime.<br /><br />Having been examined through the lens of practical experience, as well as academic research, the refugee problem overall has been analysed in this book with sympathy and rigour.<br /><br />Legal practitioners and advisers, as well as those with academic interests in the rights of refugees -- or those who may be responsible for decision-making regarding those rights --  will certainly find this excellent book a helpful, if not an indispensible acquisition.from somewhere else.<br /><br />For example, after World War II, there were at least 3 million displaced persons, or refugees in Europe, many of whom were able to emigrate to North America, but as far as it is known, received no `restitution' for their seized property.<br /><br />What the author accomplishes admirably in this book is to re-open the discussion and debate on this almost insoluble problem, focusing on the more recent experiences with post-conflict restitution and return.

Now, no business or government can do without it, nor can most individual users.<br /><br />Nevertheless in many respects it has grown from infancy into a wild child, or as some have said, a wild frontier, almost completely lawless and therefore subject to exploitation and abuse, with all kinds of desperate measures put in place to make it `safe for the children', not to mention the rest of us.<br /><br />Joanna Kulesza, an assistant professor of international public law at Lodz University in Poland has therefore written a timely and important book advocating international standards of governance.  The book should particularly interest legal scholars concerned with international law and international relations.<br /><br />Practitioners involved in any area of IT law, or for that matter, international trade over the internet will also find it immensely useful, not only as a study of the current Promethean state of internet law, but also as an examination of possibilities and probabilities which will affect internet governance in the future.<br /><br />This lucid and erudite book begins with a quote from Kofi Annan, who, speaking at the Global Internet Governance Forum in New York in 2004, observed that `the Internet has revolutionized trade, heath, education and indeed the very fabric of human communication and exchange'.<br /><br />`Clearly, there is a need for governance,' he adds, `but that does not necessarily mean that it has to be done in the traditional way, for something that is so very different.'<br /><br />Since that quite prescient statement was made, Internet usage worldwide has increased to an estimated 2.5 billion users, or one in three of the world's population.  The need for some form of international standard for Internet governance has become urgent.<br /><br />`Laying down common legal principles governing the Internet as a whole would facilitate the protection of users' rights,' remarks the author - and who would disagree?<br /><br />The book therefore reveals a broad range of views surrounding the issue of Internet governance.  Such topics as international copyright protection, state responsibility regarding cyber-attacks and online protection of privacy are discussed.<br /><br />A comparative study is made of the way in which different jurisdictions approach the problem; the US, EU, China and Singapore included.<br /><br />The author's suggested solution revolves around the principle of `International Internet Law' which could evolve, we assume, in a similar way to international environmental law.<br /><br />An Internet Framework Convention would be required to point the way for international cooperation on regulating the Internet worldwide in an enlightened, ethical manner, ideally in keeping with democratic principles and traditions of free speech.<br /><br />Any user of the Internet; certainly anyone concerned with its future will find much to consider in this thought provoking book.  Researchers in this area will be delighted by the bibliography of some 26 pages, which offers abundant avenues for further reading and enquiry.  There is also an extensive table of cases and statutes. The publication date is 2012.Internet governance has become urgent.<br /><br />`Laying down common legal principles governing the Internet as a whole would facilitate the protection of users' rights,' remarks the author - and who would disagree?<br /><br />The book therefore reveals a broad range of views surrounding the issue of Internet governance.

B007Z9RAX4|2.0|I love chick-kicks-ass movies, but this one is simply confusing.  It's all happening  because of an incident in Barcelona, but it's never clear exactly what the incident was.  We're left confused as to who are the good guys and bad guys.  And the people trying to kill the heroine seem awfully inept.  This is the second movie from director Steven Soderbergh to go into the sell-back box.  Contagion went there as well.
B00846REIS|3.0|I read so many comments on this book and decided to add it to my kindle library. Unfortunately, it turned to be so boring, I could hardly finish it. I do not believe the characters, the feelings they are supposed to share, the story itself. They have known each for only several days  and he agrees to participate in couple therapy? She already loves him? He is not ready for dating and offers her to move in? Come on! Are you for real? I am not a fan of 50 Shades, but reading that book was at least entertaining, reading this one was boring.

B000BYRCGU|3.0|Decent Reboot Of '[[ASIN:B00441GYSS The Deep]]'. More or less a straight rip of the original Benchley story and 1977 movie, so don't expect anything fresh.<br /><br />Hundreds of years apart two valuable cargos sink to the bottom of the sea. Freakishly, both end up resting in the exact same spot. One of gold, the other, narcotics. The problem: The cold-blooded owner of eight-hundred kilos of cocaine wants his product back and is more than willing to commit multiple murders in order to reclaim the contents of his stricken plane. Can the protagonists salvage the product and keep the true treasure secret from the thugs - all while avoiding a collective anonymous grave?<br /><br />And despite my general distaste for reboots, I found myself liking the film as a decent rental. Perhaps because of a long-standing love of movies which deal with lost treasures coloring my perspective. But also because I felt the actors devoted their artistic energies into the project, giving the flick energy beyond a typical rehash.<br /><br />Jacqueline Bisset - who could ever forget that opening sequence in 'The Deep'? But if there were anyone who could, ahem, top that performance - I'd say Jessica Alba works her own special magic.<br /><br />Still on the fence when it comes to co-lead Paul Walker. Screened several productions over the years and he certainly looks the part of a star - tall, handsome and projects the lead actor riff. But I haven't seen anything that really challenges his acting ability, if there is one. The fast car franchise not really helping him in my opinion; the sensitive tough guy thing only carrying him so far. But in this production, I thought he was solid in his role as a former treasure hunter relegated to doing dive tours to make a living.<br /><br />The film is most enjoyable when Walker and Alba were on screen together - there's a genuine rapport as they play a young couple in love. A true testament to on-screen chemistry, arguably one of the most deceptively difficult things to capture in front of the cameras for a pair of performers who aren't actually romantically involved.<br /><br />I'd be remiss not to note Josh Brolin, whose skill often surpasses that of the productions he participates in. A top notch actor in every respect, even when he's not the featured player.<br /><br />Overall, entertaining enough, while artfully dodging most of the reflection from the original.fficult things to capture in front of the cameras for a pair of performers who aren't actually romantically involved.<br /><br />I'd be remiss not to note Josh Brolin, whose skill often surpasses that of the productions he participates in.

0316023744|2.0|Perhaps the most positive thing that can be said about Beevor's book is that it's better than Andrew Roberts' \\"The Storm of War\\".  It includes nothing new in the telling, and displays a decidedly unbalanced priority of different battles and campaigns.<br /><br />This is another British-authored history of World War II that devotes more ink to British defeats of arms than it does to American victories. The Battle of Crete is lavished with nine pages, while Coral Sea and Midway between them rate only five pages, and his three pages on Midway have many errors:  the initial sighting of the Japanese fleet was to the Northwest, not Southwest; the Midway aircraft not only \\"failed to score many hits\\" they didn't score ANY hits; the US carrier aircrews weren't \\"barely out of flying school\\" except for the Hornet's, the Yorktown and Enterprise groups had flown and practiced together for at least two years; no Japanese battleship was \\"severely damaged\\".  And he perpetuates the Mitsuo Fuchida myth that the Japanese carrier decks were full of armed planes when the American dive bombers appeared. Paschal and Tully demonstrated conclusively in their book \\"Shattered Sword\\", which came out seven years before this book, that the carrier decks were empty because the Japanese Carriers had been zigzagging for hours to avoid the string of attacks, and had cleared the decks to land CAP fighters.  Why is Beevor's first description of the sublime American Admiral Raymond Spruance limited to, \\"a fitness fanatic\\"? Almost three of the fourteen paragraphs quote Japanese participants verbatim. There is only one concluding sentence from Chester Nimitz.<br /><br />Iwo Jima has two listings in the index, Malta has fifteen and Hong Kong eleven.  In fact he uses more ink criticizing American general Joseph Stilwell's conduct than he devotes to Midway.<br /><br />He's confused about the Pearl Harbor attack. The Japanese planes did not take off at 6:05am on Sunday Dec. 8, but on Sunday Dec. 7 local time. Oklahoma sailors were not trapped \\"beneath the hull\\" but rather inside it.<br /><br />Likewise he claims that MacArthur in Manila immediately called a staff meeting but then \\"hesitated\\" to give Brereton orders to bomb Formosa, when it is widely and well documented that MacArthur's staff wouldn't even let Brereton meet with their boss.<br /><br />Beevor bizarrely characterizes Eisenhower as \\"politically naive\\". Ike's been criticized for many things, but his political savvy is one area most agree on.<br /><br />He cites a story about American general Mark Clark having to board a British submarine near Algiers without his trousers as a \\"minor humiliation\\" and \\"undignified\\". Interesting that he chose to mention this rather than the many humiliations that the British suffered.<br /><br />He even makes careless mistakes when writing about the British. Rommel certainly did not have \\"10,000 vehicles\\" at the beginning of his May 1942 offensive in North Africa, concealed by sandstorms or otherwise.<br /><br />I was happy to see Beevor criticize Montgomery's conduct of el Alamein, though his sponsor and water carrier Alan Brooke comes off admirably.<br /><br />A reviewer from Israel claims that the book gives scant coverage to the War in the East.  I couldn't disagree more.  Beevor probably gives more coverage to this front than he does to the Pacific.  On the other hand, Beevor writes very little about the Combined Bomber Offensive, which tied down the bulk of the Luftwaffe, much of the Germans' store of 88mm guns, and over 600,000 flak troops, for two years.  The Bomber Offensive may not have brought Germany to its knees directly, but it did help the Soviet Army's efforts quite considerably.<br /><br />What was perhaps most disturbing was Beevor's apparent refusal to state that Hitler was aware of, let alone ordered, the specifics of the Holocaust.  Very early in the book Beevor writes that Hitler had a \\"dismissive attitude toward administration,\\" and claims that underlings \\"seizing on a random comment from the Fuhrer, or trying to second guess his wishes..would initiate programs.\\"  This excuse might have been useful to Thomas a Becket's killers, but is shameful in this case.  A third of the way into the book, Beevor writes that Hitler \\"still does not appear to have made an irrevocable decision on a Final Solution\\" (in Dec 1941), even though Beevor wrote that \\"the Polish Diaspora had begun\\" in 1939 and mentions Hitler's specific orders to kill those with developmental disabilities.<br /><br />And then it was over.  After 781 pages, we get two pages that make absolutely no effort to summarize or draw conclusions.<br /><br />If you don't have any other histories of World War II readily at hand, you might learn something from this book.  But many other books written before this past year do a much better job of telling the full story more accurately.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Alright, I can understand Book One being top of the best seller list for eons:  when a book gets this much press one feels almost obligated to read it, just to understand cultural references.  So I bought it and read it and found the sex scenes to be fairly erotic and titillating, and kind of enjoyed the story:  what woman doesn't like thinking about finding a gorgeous, troubled billionaire who finds them uniquely captivating and that only she can save from his weird demons?  The writing, though, is so bad that it is almost camp.  I would say this book is the literary equivalent of the movie Showgirls.  How can so many reviewers praise the writing?  Compared to what, Hi and Lois?  But all in all, I enjoyed (in a guilty pleasure kind of way) Book One enough to pay $9.99 for Book Two.  Big mistake.  Book Two is just more of the nonsense of Book One, and by now it is getting more and more boring.  I found myself skipping the sex scenes, and skimming the rest of the book just to see what happens.  I can't bring myself to actually pay for Book Three.  If I could get it for free, I'd quickly skim it.<br /><br />So my recommendation is that yes, you should get your hands on Book One, but only if you can do so without paying, and only so you will know what the buzz is about.

1400097029|3.0|I don't know if it is because the book is not in American English, or if it is because the author is from a different educational class, but there were at least 175 words in this book that I did not know, such as ziggurat, revenant, velutinous, and ichor. This detracted from the reading for me.<br /><br />There was also a lack of commas where they should be, creating run on sentences, often enough to be annoying to me.<br /><br />The most interesting part to me was the way sudden memories would intrude into the narrator's mind in the middle of another train of thought, the way that remembered images do, and the detail with which they are described.<br /><br />Not much to this book; not very moving emotionally.

0141047976|4.0|This is probably one of the very best books on important aspects of real (not theoretical) economics that should be read by laypersons and academics. It describes the effects of economic and political decisions on our everyday lives, and how far removed modern practised economic philosophy is from what is really happening.<br /><br />It is easy and entertaining to read, and though controversial, it is still of academic relevance. It also describes human behaviour, and can therefore also be described as social economics, despite being classed as \\"non-scientific\\" by some \\"pure\\" economists. Economists tend to forget, of course, that all economics is based on what in many respects is unpredictable human behaviour.<br /><br />More importantly, it also describes the relationship between economics and politics (which is also unpredictable because of human behaviour).<br /><br />The author, Ha-Joon Chang, is remarkably insightful, thoughtful and understanding (except for a few important things), and there is a very interesting description on Wikipedia of his activities. He is a professor at Cambridge University. Of course, there are many readers in the USA who don't like what he has to say about Capitalism. However, he doesn't condemn Capitalism; he just shows how it is being misused and abused.<br /><br />I give it one less than five stars because the author (like most others in economics and politics) does not understand the developed and developing countries' ubiquitous banking system. This banking system is a fractional reserve, and therefore fraudulent, money-making scheme for the world's interrelated privatised banks, and which has been the basis for all \\"booms and busts\\" in human history over the last 300 years. The current Euro crisis is basically a result of this system.<br /><br />With regard to this missing information in the author's book, I would implore readers to examine the research findings and recommendations of the London-based New Economics Foundation, one of the few organisations that have economists who truly understand the relevance and workings of our current money system in economies. Another organisation is the Money Reform Party, which has the ambition to educate fellow politicians (most all of whom are ignorant about the relevance of money creation and distribution in economies). There are other organisations like these in North America and elsewhere.<br /><br />One other particularly glaring, though relatively smaller flaw in his arguments and recommendations concerns the popular notion of \\"equal opportunity\\". He discusses this at length and alludes to the requirement of cross-border migration without restrictions, even without considering commonly known socio-economic repercussions. This is contrary to his other arguments that, to paraphrase succinctly, \\"charity should best begin at home\\", and that outright \\"free-marketing\\" does not work well for host countries. He also contradicts his own argument that countries and their States should have the right to determine the skills needs of, and training for, their own industries. This unrestricted cross-border migration for \\"equal opportunity\\" sits nicely with the desires of mega-rich industrialists in their protected socio-economic (non-geographic) enclaves, for unrestricted migrations help drive down the wage costs in the host countries. Wage earners are also consumers, so the more labour units there are at low cost, the cheaper the products and the greater the sales. Wunderbar! Why do you think Britain has \\"difficulty\\" in monitoring and controlling illegal immigrants? I would say that it satisfies the ideology of the liberals as well as the pockets of the conservatives! I discovered reports by Civitas UK on these issues of migration after I recorded my views on this matter.ne of the few organisations that have economists who truly understand the relevance and workings of our current money system in economies.

B004EPZ084|4.0|Horrible Bosses is one of those \\"It's so crude, it's pointless drivel... and I like it\\" type of comedies.  The storyline is simple- 3 employees who strongly dislike their ignorant and compassionless bosses come up with a plan to eventually murder them in the middle of the night.  It turns out this is one of the craziest nights you can imagine, haha.<br /><br />The film features plenty of top notch actors and actresses, the most surprising one has to be Jennifer Aniston playing the role of an exceptionally sexually active dentist who loves to say the worst things you can imagine while hitting on her assistant (a young man who refuses to go along with her obnoxious and flirtatious requests).  Now THIS is interesting- the woman is the one who's sexually harassing the man!  The tables have turned in this instance, so obviously I strongly recommend all children completely avoid this movie as a result of Jennifer Aniston's character.<br /><br />Another high point is Jason Bateman who, as always, plays the role of a guy trying to do the right thing and finding himself involved in the most unusual and regrettable of circumstances.  He needs to stop hanging out with losers and misfits!  Colin Farrell is sort of hilarious as well (believe it or not).  He plays a wimp that never says the right thing, like ever.  He inadvertently starts trouble as a result.<br /><br />This is a trashy comedy, plain and simple.  It does however benefit from maintaining a somewhat coherent plot, and the jokes are numerous and hardly let up. When the actual murder attempts get underway, there are a few occasions when the storytelling is sacrified for an excessive use of pointless gibberish between the main characters, which is why my rating can't possibly be a 5 out of 5.<br /><br />Overall, it's crude, it's trashy, it's todays comedy that sells really.

B006VKKAWQ|5.0|Over fifty years after his death, it must be difficult for audiences to grasp the importance of Arturo Toscanini's contribution to music. George Szell summed it up best, in reaction to hearing Toscanini in 1930: \\"This was orchestral performance of a kind new to all of us.  The clarity of texture; the precision of ensemble; the rightness of balances; the virtuosity of every section, every solo player in the orchestra - then at its peak - in the service of an interpretative concept of evident, self-effacing integrity, enforced with irresistible willpower and unflagging ardor, set new, undreamed-of standards literally overnight.\\"  Today, we take for granted what Szell marveled over, and that's mainly thanks to Toscanini and his successors - including Szell. Thus, it's no exaggeration to say that Toscanini initiated the modern era of conducting.<br /><br />However, Toscanini's recorded legacy is problematic. First, Toscanini didn't start recording until 1920, when he was 53 and halfway through his career. Second, recording technology was primitive and seldom captured the orchestral sonority with any accuracy. Many of Toscanini's recordings were sonically substandard even for the time. RCA's use of NBC's Studio 8-H - where Saturday Night Live is now performed - didn't help matters. (Stereo recordings of Toscanini's final two concerts - not included in this set - give an idea of the glowing sonority Toscanini pursued, but the playing is tragically off form.) Unlike Stokowski, Toscanini didn't know much about recording technology, but he knew what he liked. A comment he made to a recording producer is characteristic: \\"It's perfect, just like reading the score.\\"<br /><br />Much has been written about Toscanini's performances: the lean, presciently-HIP Mozart, propulsive Beethoven, transparent and virile Brahms, non-sentimental Tchaikovsky, bon-bons given as much care as established masterpieces, and opera which placed pacing and structure above singers' vanity - this is what the critics of Toscanini's time raved about. For Toscanini, the performance of great - and not so great - music was as much a moral as a musical matter. The music simply HAD to go a certain way. But there was a less positive side to Toscanini's fanaticism: Some of his recordings, particularly of concertos, are lacking in communicativeness and spontaneity - it was Toscanini's way or the highway. His concerto recordings with Heifetz, Horowitz, and Rubinstein in particular often find soloist and conductor poles apart: Rubinstein and Toscanini are simply not together in the coda of the opening movement of Beethoven's Third Concerto; and hard as it is to imagine Horowitz being intimidated by anyone, that's exactly the case in their studio recording of Brahms' Second Concerto. Serkin, on the other hand, saw music in much the same way as Toscanini, and they fit each other hand in glove during Beethoven's Fourth Concerto. The recordings in this collection argue both sides of the Toscanini coin.<br /><br />Toscanini's approach changed over the years, as he came to value structural cohesiveness over episodic expression. This can be clearly heard in two recordings of Mozart's Haffner Symphony: in the first, with the New York Philharmonic in 1929, the forte outbursts and pianissimo replies are played at different tempos, like an opera aria between an imposing suitor and demure lady; in 1946 at NBC, the passages are played straight. But certain things were always there: the clarity and balance Szell marveled over, the sure sense of rhythm even when using rubato, and the phrasing which takes the music coherently from beginning to end.<br /><br />This set, which compiles all of Toscanini's authorized RCA recordings, uses the best existing transfers available from the Sony (formerly RCA) vaults - meaning the 1999-2000 Immortal series for about 24 discs worth of material, 2006 transfers of the Philadelphia Orchestra recordings, and some JVC issues from Japan. But the bulk of the material comes from RCA's early 1990s Gold Seal reissues which sound rather cramped and compressed. Paradoxically, the New York Philharmonic recordings, which many consider some of Toscanini's best, sound better than many of the NBC recordings despite being older.<br /><br />Documentation is scant: a miniature book but no notes for individual discs - and no librettos for the operas.  Surely Sony could have scanned the existing notes and libretti into a CD-ROM?  The cover art approximates the look of the 1990s Gold Seal series, although Robert Hupka's famous photographs have been replaced.  There is an issue when multiple discs are included in a single \\"gatefold\\" album: Unlike what one would encounter in a 2 LP set, where one pulls the discs from the outside openings, here the openings are along the center line of the gatefold - making the discs difficult to remove without damaging the jacket.<br /><br />A DVD containing the 1980s documentary \\"Toscanini - the Maestro\\" is also included. But I'd also recommend acquiring the Testament DVDs of the ten concerts Toscanini conducted on television - a revelatory view of how Toscanini conducted the orchestra, not the audience.<br /><br />You get what you pay for. I can't recommend this for those who bought the complete collection in the 1990s - chances are die-hard Toscanini fans have already supplemented their collections with the Immortal series. But for those wanting an overview of the second half of Toscanini's career, this set is an excellent choice.aterial comes from RCA's early 1990s Gold Seal reissues which sound rather cramped and compressed.

0345803507|5.0|I've fallen deeper and deeper in love with this trilogy as a whole.  This last book represents everything that has building up to this finale.  The love between \\"Cristian\\" and \\"Ana\\" finally becoming one and being a family just makes it all worth it, but the suspense is what gets me, I mean the mix of \\"Cristian's\\" past to his future and having someone as strong as \\"Ana\\" in it makes it all better.  I just LOVE all three books!!

So much has been learnt, and yet so much more remains unknown, both at subatomic and cosmic levels.<br /><br />Superbly honest and full of enthusiasm for his subject, Krauss is to be congratulated.

B004J4WKTW|5.0|There are already a lot of amazing reviews for this book, but I just wanted to add another 5 star rating. I read this book and then immediately read it again. It just completely took me to another world, I was completely immersed in it and I never ever wanted to leave. I would have loved for the book to have been longer. I would have loved more interactions between Marco and Celia. But I am happy that I got any of it at all, I am so happy I took a chance on this book. It's one I will return to any time I want to be swept away into a daydream. (Sorry for the cheese, this book draws it out of me.)

B008JGSM6G|3.0|This game is well designed, but could be better. I blazed through the first 90 screens in a very short period, but was disappointed when several of the puzzles could be solved in many different ways. I think better care could have been taken in design. It seems like the puzzles were designed by a computer, not by thinking out difficult tricks. It is worth the download, especially if you love puzzles, but I suspect you may become bored with it.

0345803485|5.0|First of all, if you're going to whine about \\"poor quality of writing\\" then why the heck are you reading smutty romance novels? I didn't read this series to expand my mind and learn astrophysics for pete's sake! I'm reading it for the love and sex. DUH! I love that Christian ISN'T perfect. He's so flawed. And to dispute all the feminist whiners, Ana doesn't just let it slide. She stands up for herself when needed, and Christian loves her for it. That's what draws him to her. In reality, SHE has all the power. You get the sexy romantic aspect of a man being obsessed with her, without the violence or degradation. It's perfect, sexy, and intirguing. This series drew me in like NO OTHER. And for the record, it is nothing...NOTHING...like Twilight. I don't know WHY people come up with that cmoparions in the least bit except a slightly over protective good looking male? Dumb to even associate the two. READ THESE BOOKS!!!

0142001104|1.0|I have to say I'm a bit mystified by all the praise of this book.  Despite its claims to the contrary, it offered, in my view, very few \\"actionable\\" tools or approaches.  Repeatedly, I sought to drill down to better understand the authors' concepts and perspectives; too often these were buried under an impenetrable avalance of cliches and platitudes...I mean a LOT of them.  I would read a chapter only to be distressed at it's evanescence...I'd like to think that I'm an attentive and engaged reader, but I literally couldn't apply or clearly connect with many of the concepts presented.  More disturbingly, some of the cases/examples seem to me to strain credulity and plausibility.  The Zanders seem like interesting, winning people, but I'm sorry to say this book added precious little value.

B0073XV2W2|4.0|Kill Decision is a non-stop action thriller featuring advanced technology and an all too plausible near future scenario.  This book drops you right in the middle of the action with a high-tech drone attack and just keeps going.  The first part of the book contains a lot of information on high-tech warfare and some background science, which was as fascinating as the action sequences.  Once this information is established, the action comes even faster in an almost non-stop ride to the finish.<br /><br />This is a classic page-turner that doesn't let you go until you've reached the end. Author Daniel Suarez does a great job making you feel that no one and nowhere is safe.  This fuels the sense of danger and excitement.  Paranoia, after all, is just smart when everyone really is out to get you.<br /><br />The heroes are convincing and dedicated while the bad guys are nebulous and operate in shadow.  You could nit-pick on some characterization which isn't really all that deep, but the concepts and the action are what this novel is about and it is more than worth it.  If you like high-adrenaline action that doesn't let up paired with plausible and frightening technology development, you are going to love this book.  Highly recommended.
B004132HZS|4.0|With over 400 reviews, its hard to imagine that I can say anything which has not already been said. But let me rehash some obvious points. First, these are not rewritings of the original Sherlock Holmes stories. They should best be though of as new stories, based loosely on one or more of Arthur Conan Doyle's works, with the same characters, but in 21st century London rather than 19th century London. Some things have been sanitized. Holmes morphine habit is replaced by nicotine patches. Also, the sense of several secondary characters have been changed. Chief inspector Lestrade seems far less helpless, and far more a decent policeman, albeit a bit colorless. But his assistants have no respect. One sargeant, for example, rather appropriately refers to Holmes as \\"freak\\". Both Mycroft and Moriarity have been made either younger and thinner, or both. And both are played with the kind of tics which distinguish someone who is far, far smarter than anyone you will ever meet, aside from Sherlock himself. All that is to the good. The modernization is done with absolutely no amount of clever asides which say \\"Look what I did to modernize this or that.\\"<br /><br />Now the down side. The first episode, \\"A Study in Pink\\" is loosely based on the novel \\"A Study in Scarlet\\", but without the whole Mormon back story. The conclusion is totally different. But being based on a preexisting plot gives it good coherence. The second episode is based on a few different short stories, but it has a certain coherence. The end resolves the situation laid out in the opening. The third episode, \\"The Great Game\\" has problems, at least on two successive viewings. It is based on several different Holmes short stories, but they are pidgon-holed into a plot which is has so many twists and turns that no amount of Holmes reading will help. This leads me to the voice-over commentary provided by the principle actors. It helps not one wit in understanding the plot. It has lots of useful comments about how scenes were shot, but no illumination about what is driving the plot. When we find out that it was all orchestrated by Moriarty, and we meet him, in the end, helps very little.<br /><br />All in all, this is a really great series. The acting, the direction, and the music are spot on. In the third episode, it seems the writing became a bit too enthralled with its cleverness. But, get it and judge for yourself. You will be entertained and entranced.enes were shot, but no illumination about what is driving the plot.

030758836X|4.0|Having read Gillian Flynn's first two efforts, \\"Sharp Objects\\" and \\"Dark Places,\\" I was very mush looking forward to digging into her latest, \\"Gone Girl.\\" No one writes about dark, twisted characters better than Flynn, and Gone Girl certainly does not disappoint in this respect. It's part mystery and part psychological thriller in which middle class, jobless magazine writer Nick Dunne is accused of murdering his missing wife Amy. The conceit of the novel revolves around alternating narratives in which Nick (post-disappearance) and Amy (pre-disappearance through diary entries) tell the tale from their unique perspectives.<br /><br />Did Nick kill Amy or didn't he? There's plenty of damning physical (but largely circumstantial) evidence to suggest that he did, yet in his narrative, he asserts that he's no killer and is just as much in the dark as everyone else as to her whereabouts. Should he be believed? This question propels the first half of the book, which is filled with a page-turning series of twists and turns that I found completely riveting.<br /><br />I can't describe what happens after the midway point without revealing major spoilers about the book, spoilers that would surely ruin its enjoyment. Let's just say that there's a major and largely unforeseen turn that really ramps up reader interest. At least, it did for this reader. This new revelation keeps the story powered under full steam...until we approach the end of the book. Author Flynn seems to have written herself into a bit of a corner...with no credible way out. The ending felt a bit preposterous and artificial. I was left feeling largely unsatisfied with its outcome. It's far from a tidy Hollywood outcome.<br /><br />Leaving the plot of Gone Girl aside, it has to be said the Gillian Flynn writes psychopaths (and lesser sick, twisted individuals) like no one else. She knows how to write them so darkly and with such an authentic voice that one wants to take a shower to rid themselves of the bad taste in their brain. These characters are indeed repulsive and reprehensible, but they're written in such a way as to keep the reader fascinated, like a curious driver passing a road accident, wondering just how much more depraved things can get.e in their brain.

B000HC2LI0|5.0|This review is primarily about the series, but I can make a few comments about this packaging. It is better than what I found in some other \\"Complete Seasons\\" packaging. All seasons are in a uniform format, even if the disks are simply lifted from yearly issues. The file folder styie is decent, relatively easy to remove and re-insert disks, unlike most jewel box containers. But, there are some errors in the labelling of the contents of the disks on the back of the folder, and in season 1 and season 2, the scene selection seems to malfunction. In order to select the beginning, the second scene needs to be highlighted. But on to the story.<br /><br />I really like to see this series, even with its huge cast and many, many different issues, as the story primarily of Josh Lyman and Donna Moss. The pilot opens with a controversy centered on Josh's disrespecting a member of the conservative right Christian fundamentalists. Two of the emotional high points, one at the end of season 1 and one at the end of season 5 involves serious injuries to Josh and Donna respectively. Josh has his ups and downs throughout the series. His low point comes in episode 5 of season 5, when it seems no one wants to be seen with him in the Democratic party, after a Democratic senator switches party due to Josh's intimidation. Josh's star starts rising when the First Lady asks why Josh isn't part of the negotiations over the budget, and Josh orchestrates a stunt which allows Bartlett to pull a big victory out of the hat over the budget. Virtually all of Season 6 and 7 are devoted to Josh's managing the presidental campaign of Matt Santos, and the parallel fortunes of Donna, in the campaign of Santos' democratic rival. Donna and Josh have the two best scenes in the last episode, where Josh (with Sam Seaborn) takes his position as Santos chief of staff, and Donna is shown her office as chief of staff to the new first lady, in an Old Executive Offfice Building office which seems bigger and grander than the Oval Office, a far, far cry from her cubicle in the bullpen of The West Wing. The last few episodes finally resolve the romantic tension between Josh and Donna.<br /><br />What makes The West Wing so impressive is when one watches other shows which deal with similar circumstances. The Sigourney Weaver headlined show, \\"Political Animals\\" seems detached from reality in comparison. The characters are not smart, fast talking, and not diverted by relatively trivial matters such as sex. In The West Wing, power and responsiblity seem to trump mere sex at practically every turn. Josh skirts sexual laisons with various characters (three at least), and they all pale and are undermined by political position and power.<br /><br />I can't think of any series which has such a rich mixture of great characters and great dialogue and innovative direction as this. Even relatively minor characters, such as John Larroquette as the White House council in one episode is memorable, as is David Huddleston's brief appearance as a Republican senator. The king of The West Wing guest appearances is John Goodman's playing the Speaker of the House, Glen Allen Walken, who takes over as president for three days.<br /><br />It is also worth mentioning that with the cost of this set, each episode is half the cost of downloading it from Amazon, 1 dollar versus about 2 dollars.than the Oval Office, a far, far cry from her cubicle in the bullpen of The West Wing.

0765322889|1.0|I read \\"Gardens of the Moon\\" up until its last page waiting for it to get better, it doesn´t. Maybe the second book is great but I can´t give it a try after suffering through the first book. The author doesn´t explain anything (you have the feeling throughout the book that this can´t be the first book, that you must be missing a previous book because nobody tells you what is a warren, an ascendant,.. what the hell is going on and what is the point of it all). And you get to the end of the book and you still feel that way. Horrible.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|I loved this book. It sucked me right in and I couldn't put it down. The chemistry between the two characters left me thinking about them even when I wasn't reading. I would recommend this to anyone, however I do agree with all of the bad reviews. The writer is clearly trying to hard with words, but at the same time not trying hard enough. I had to look up a lot of words in the dictionary (which I NEVER do) because they were so obscure I had never heard them. On the flip side, there was way too much repetition. Too many words and phrases were overused and it was extremely annoying. After a while I was able to ignore it (just like I ignored all the annoying things about Twilight) but I really wish it would have just been written better. Many times the writer was just over thinking things, you know you can just used the word \\"said\\" instead of \\"muttered\\" or \\"murmured\\" over and over. I totally get why so many people are annoyed with this book, and but I still liked it and will continue on to the second and third books of the series.

0440237688|5.0|There were some things that lacked explanation but you could fill it in easily with your imagination.  It was a quick read also.
0375842209|1.0|Someone asked me why this book would be considered a 'young adult' novel.  It's because of the short sentences, limited vocabulary, and choppy paragraphs with cutesy fonts combined with glaringly obvious symbolism.  To me, all of those things should be a detriment, not things to recommend the book.  There's certainly nothing else to recommend this as reading for children of any age.<br /><br />The author is exploiting a global human tragedy as a vehicle to wring emotion out of his poor writing style and sell books to kids.  That's immoral in my view and I am appalled that awards have been handed out to this drivel.  The Book Thief also features a plethora of bad metaphors on every page, shallow stereotypical characters, and unrelenting gloom.  In addition, you can observe poor use of foreshadowing and tell, tell, tell rather than show.  I guess if a teacher wanted to use this book as an example of how not to write, he/she could hardly find a better example.<br /><br />I plowed through this gloppy mess since the book was selected by my book club.  Any other book about the holocaust would be a better choice for your time and money.  I'm writing this review in irritation that schoolchildren will be required to read this, being told what a 'good' book it is and what they are supposed to 'learn' from it.  Unless they are learning how to make money in spite of lack of writing skills by using horrific themes with vulnerable child protagonists, the students will spend their time wondering why they don't get it.<br /><br />My guess is that reviewers who like this book found the device of writing from death's point of view to be interesting and had never run across it before.  If this is you, I suggest watching the Canadian TV series 'Dead Like Me' in which you will find some excellent writing, thoughtful insights, and fully fleshed out characters who develop over time.
B00003CWN3|5.0|Amazing movie. By far one of my newly favorites. Hillary Swank's role is something totally different and out of the box for her and she portrays a trans like a champ. I recommend this movie only to the open-minded.
B004LSO6YI|5.0|I have NEVER written a review on a movie but after seeing this one, I felt it was necessary. I've seen a lot of lesbian movies in my time and most are cheaply done and you could tell the main characters were acting. This movie has it all, the BEST chemistry between characters, best acting, best directed and I even loved the music during the entire movie. Both characters will take your breath away with their acting because every scene they make you feel what they are feeling and it makes you come alive. I was set back a little at the beginning of the movie with the short stories but that shortly falls into the flow of the story. I honestly don't know how this movie is not on everyone's top 10 list because it is so realistic and even the love making scenes were beautiful captured and tastefully done. There doesn't seem to be any french kissing involved that I could tell but the movie kisses as I call them are still very believable and the chemistry certainly comes out. I am a hugh Traci Dinwiddie fan because as Nicole Conn states, who would not like to come home to her every day!

And then, my heart broke a little at the ending. I still would recommend this book to anyone. But honestly the ending just isn't what I had hoped. This book was similar to foreplay with a hot, sexy man- and it feels so good and you think you're there- and then BAM you fall short at the end (if you catch my drift). In hindsight it was still fun, but the big O would have made it better.

030758836X|3.0|I read this book after reading several positive reviews.  However, I am probably one of the few people who feel that this book was a let-down.  The book started off slowly, but picked up in the middle with an interesting twist in the plot.  The ending, I felt, fell flat, making the book as a whole, a disappointment.  Overall, the writing was very good, and the characters were well developed.  The plot was not as good as I expected based on previous reviews.
B007549W62|1.0|I wasted two hours of my time so you don't have to. There is no way to sugar coat this, this movie is a waste of time. Slow moving most of the time, a total of 2 hours actual run time could have easily been condensed into a 20 minute short. Maybe that could have made it more watchable. You watch and watch and watch and wait for something interesting to happen, some sort of pay-off, but nothing.<br /><br />Just about everything that could potentially have been interesting about the movie was touched very tangentially and then forgotten. On the plus side, it avoids some of predictable cliches found in movies in this genre. That could have saved the movie, except, nothing interesting happens. The suspense ends up being, not what is going to happen to the plot/characters next, but will something interesting happen eventually? The answer: it happened, it was the song playing over the closing credits.<br /><br />There is no depth to the characters, no arc, no realistic progression or development. The film slowly devolved into random violence for the sake of violence.<br /><br />The DVD extras are 1) audio commentary track with the director and some of the actors, and 2) 2 minute trailer for the movie. It has subtitles and it is 2.35 widescreen anamorphic.<br /><br />The DVD packaging is nice, a standard case with a paper sleeve on top. The post-apocalyptic picture is just there as eye-candy, it has very little to do with this movie.
B00164GDA0|1.0|The movie, the story, is great, I have seen this film before. But I wish I would have bought the DVD or the Blu ray + DVD combo (if it exists), instead of just the blu ray. Lesson learned, I am of the mind to buy more combos of BluRay+DVD from now on.<br /><br />Tried to watch this last night, played a few minutes then froze up in my blu ray player. I checked the disc, surface was pristine, no finger grease or smudges, came right out of the blu ray case. My firmware and codecs were just updated a month or so ago on my Samsung home theater blu ray player. Now I have an expensive beverage coaster or small frisbee.
0553801473|3.0|If words are wind then so are letters in much of this installment. The main stages here are the Wall and Slavers Bay with a secondary stage of Dorne, the Iron Isles and Kings Landing. Briefly mentioned are the Riverlands and Winterfell.<br /><br />There are as usual unexpected deaths at the end, Tyrion's interesting adventures and the sudden return of almost forgotten characters. I wasn't interested in Arya's adventures nor Bran's in this installment. Both of them seem to be no longer a part of the main narrative and are just added in for completeness and to fill up pages. Of course this is only going off of what we have so far. The main thing to remember about all this is that anyone can die and the only constant is the rat race for the Iron Throne.<br /><br />It is definitely true that there are just too many throw away characters in this one it can be hard to care much about them or their plotlines. The Wildlings/Crows and all the many characters of Slavers Bay etc. make it hard to follow. It seems that the characters of Slavers Bay and the Wildlings/Crows will be forgotten once the previously introduced main characters that are there move on in life or death. They are only in bulk to be thought of as one large character kind of like the Wights or the Dragons. I found myself feeling like the proverbial \\"are we there yet\\" kids.<br /><br />The whole split chronology is a detriment as well. It means that almost half the characters are not reacting or participating in any of the events of the other half, splendid isolation in time and place. Are the messenger crows not working here? This splitting is one reason why this novel is so unfocused it's almost as if Martin is just adding stuff to keep his page count up. The constant retelling of the near past is annoying. He could have written Parts 4 and 5 as one book and cut out a lot of unnecessary details and people that showed up in Part 5. This wouldn't have worked for the marketing dept. though: the release scheduleand premier dates dictate too much. I think that's part of why he keeps changing the number of books. I wouldn't be surprised if he extended it to 10 books. We may have a new LOST on our hands here!<br /><br />I have to say that it's a definite liability that this and it's sequels are being fleshed out while a TV show is being produced of the series. This all smells too much of marketing to me, wasn't it around the start of Season 2 TV show that this novel debuted? Was the series even extended simply for cash and future TV seasons? I think this makes the rest of the books very reactive and subservient to the needs of HBO(the dragons largely disappear conveniently must be a TV/graphics budget issue) and weakens Martins credibility as a writer: but I guess once a TV writer always a TV writer. It's almost as if you should just skip the first 500-700 pages and just read the rest to get the gist of the novel. So, the next novel will be released in April 201X(near TV premiere time) or thereabouts I'm sure. There isn't even a preview of the next novel in this one at the end like the first four books, ominous sign that.<br /><br />In short it's worth a read but don't expect the tight focused story of the first four or the introduction of any new characters you'll care much about.
1400052181|5.0|I thought the book was wonderfully well researched and informative. There was one thing that bothered me, however: Why did Skloot not write about how white christian mythology was used to keep people like those in the Lacks family docile and ignorant?
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is very addictive.  At first it seems easy and then gets very difficult .  Next thing you know you have spent an hour trying to solve a single grid. Hints might be helpful but not neccessary.  Reccomended to anyone with lots of spare time.
B00843TZJM|5.0|I don't agree with the negative reviews here.  Considering that Graham and David are 70 and Stephen is 67,<br />they sound pretty damn good for their age and can still rock it on stage.  How many bands or musicians can<br />say they have been playing on stage for 40 or 50 years?  Not many or certainly not many that still can play<br />well and excite the audience like these guys do with this DVD/Blu-ray.<br /><br />Going into this I was concerned about Stephen's voice since the last time I saw CSN in concert a few years ago,<br />he sounded terrible with little voice left.  For this concert, which was filmed this past April, he sounds much<br />better than I have heard him in years.  He's certainly past his prime and is not what he was as a singer but he<br />really had some extra juice going for this show especially the last song, Suite: Judy Blue Eyes.  His guitar playing,<br />flawless.<br /><br />Graham and David's voices were great as usual and they have the usual banter on stage in between songs.  The other<br />musicians playing with them are all very good and David has his son James Raymond on keyboards.  They play most of<br />the favorites you would know and the new songs for the most part are pretty good.  The only negative I would bring<br />up is that for the past 10 years they have brought some politics into their concerts (which I think should be left<br />out of concerts).  This one is no different but it's not nearly as bad when they were with Neil Young on their last<br />tour together which so blatant and heavy handed that a number of people walked out of the concert I attended.  This<br />time their discussion on Bradley Manning (the soldier who leaked miltary documents to wikileaks) was not nearly as<br />abrasive and Graham actually had a valid point about the issue.<br /><br />Technically the Blu-ray is fine.  The image is clear and there is plenty of shot changes on stage as well as audience<br />shots.  No fancy light show or multimedia on stage, just a bunch of guys playing their hearts out for you to enjoy.<br />The audio is only in DTS-Stereo (on bluray) but I was OK with that and was still able to crank the volume on my receiver<br />to fully enjoy the show.<br /><br />If you're a true fan, you will like this concert, just realize that these guys aren't in their 20/30s anymore.

0393338827|5.0|A great story-teller can come be very handy when it comes to understanding a complex event like the 2008 financial crisis; especially if that story-teller also understands the crisis sufficiently enough to supposedly* meet Albert Einstein's standard of legitimate understanding.  That is you don't sufficiently know a topic unless you can explain it to your grandmother.<br /><br />So if you're seeking some perspective on one narrow though important aspect of the crisis, \\"What were those bankers thinking when it came to loading up on subprime loans?\\", Mr. Lewis' \\"Big Short\\" goes a good way towards explaining their behavior.  However his reporting here isn't a complete picture of even the subprime aspect of the crisis.  That's because the book primarily focuses on those betting against the valuations of subprime assets; an indirect approach to understanding those who were long on their bets.  However this aspect is a highly valued one since it's provided by those who were correct in their assessments of the market, rather than the hindsight of those who were wrong.<br /><br />*While this truism is frequently attributed to Dr. Einstein, there's no evidence he actually asserted such.  So I present here tongue-in-cheek.
1878424114|5.0|I used to not read Chopra, his belief system in my mind was opposed to mind (closed minded, I know).<br /><br />Then I heard him interviewed by Anthony Robbins and his medical discussion along with spirit blew me away.<br /><br />I have shared with 1000s of people one thing he said, \\"We have 60,000 thoughts a day.\\" He went on to share that many people have 95% of the same thoughts the next day.<br /><br />The statement revolutionized my life and thinking.<br /><br />Then I read \\"Do You\\" by Russell Simmons and he said he gives The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success to all his staff. So I picked it up; and am glad I did.<br /><br />His discussion about state of mind, gratitude and giving is filled with wisdom. Here is where I appreciate Chopra, he believes people are meant to fulfill their dreams. He believes God has placed us here to be happy, and that there is enough for everyone. I now have several of his books.<br /><br />Turns out he and I are not so far about in what we believe.

Shows the true humanity, strengths and weaknesses, the good and ugly, of being an elite soldier.

Can't recommend it enough. Truly inspirational story.

1557427968|4.0|If you could retain your youth, what would you give up? What would you be willing to barter? Imagine, you're always young, vibrant, desired and the envy of all those who age around you?<br /><br />The Picture of Dorian Gray doesn't set out to answer the question, just to pose it. Oscar Wilde writes like no other I've read. The prose moves along along like a tempestuous sea. It rolls, it sways, it rocks and occasionally calms before the next surge. Amazing penmanship. Verbose conversations stir between the players as they seek to answer each other's questions and address each other's comments.<br /><br />The main character of the book, for me, was Lord Henry Wotton. A dandy gentleman who, for his own sake, is way too educated. It always seems to be Henry who plants the seeds of thought, or challenges the conventional wisdom which, in turn, sets the other players thinking. Henry meets Dorian as his portrait is finished by Basil Hallward. Henry, struck by Dorian's youth and beauty, remarks that, as Dorian ages, the picture will constantly remind him of who he was. Dorian wishes it the other way around and, his wish is granted but, at what cost? The picture always remains at the age when Dorian was painted yet, the face reflects Dorian's soul. The soul that becomes more dark and damaged.<br /><br />Chapter XI of this book describes, at Sir Henry's urging, Dorian's exploration into  life. I don't think I've ever read anything like it before. Oscar Wilde seemed to have gone mad with the pen as he describes riches, wealth, decadence and hedonism. The finest details of objects of desire are described so richly you can almost feel them. This outpouring of prose meanders over many pages. At the end of the chapter I let out a \\"phew\\" as I felt Wilde had probably thrown down his pen and gone for a nap. I was exhausted from reading it. How he felt after writing it is anyone's guess.<br /><br />Gray does some horrible things as he develops and eventually, he sees what he's become. The picture, a mirror of his soul, becomes darker and darker as his soul becomes heartless and self-serving.<br /><br />It's great stuff. The book is relatively short yet overflowing with rich text and thought provoking idioms. Enjoy it, digest it, this one is a classic.The picture, a mirror of his soul, becomes darker and darker as his soul becomes heartless and self-serving.<br /><br />It's great stuff.

B0082XJGRK|5.0|The Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius wrote his 'Meditations' between 170 and 180. Other titles assigned to the same book are: 'Personal Notes', 'Thougts', 'The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius' et al. It is one of the few complete works of a late Stoic philosopher that still exists today. He wrote his 'Meditations' as personal notes for himself. He writes about solidarity, physical adversity, good and evil, inner freedom and more. 'Meditations' of Marcus Aurelius is a book full of wisdom that brings comfort and contemplation; it is moving and inspiring. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />The 'Meditations' of Marcus Aurelius are grouped in 12 'books' (chapters). The first book is clearly different from the other eleven; it is a 'thank you' to people who have had a good influence on him. For example: 'From my grandfather Verus (I learned) good morals and the government of my temper.' (I.1). The other eleven books contain his notes. His Stoic philosophy emphasizes ethics, especially everyday problems. This book is in the public domain and can be downloaded for free from several websites.<br /><br />This edition has an active table of 'Paragraphs with First Lines', so you can 'click' on a first line and you are directly taken to that part of the book. This books begins with an introduction (location 424-621) giving some background and insight in the philosophy of Marcus Aurelius, at the end there are an appendix (loc. 5603-5908) with correspondence of Marcus Aurelius and a glossary of proper names and obsolete or obscure words (loc. 5908-5983). There are several editions of the 'Meditations' or 'Thoughts' of Marcus Aurelius available for free on the web. The advantage of this edition in relation to the others is this edition's active table of first lines which none of the other editions have.<br /><br />Some quotations from this book:<br />Since it is possible that thou mayest depart from life this very moment, regulate every act and thought accordingly. (II.11)<br />Be cheerful also, and seek not external help nor the tranquillity which others give. A man then must stand erect, not be kept erect by others. (III.5)<br />Always run to the short way; and the short way is the natural: accordingly say and do everything in conformity with the soundest reason. For such a purpose frees a man from trouble, and warfare, and all artifice and ostentatious display. (IV.51)
B00846REIS|4.0|This book was basically a spinoff of 50 shades of grey. I just finished that series, so I found this book a bit annoying.  Same characters, same issues, same sex scenes. Maybe the sequel will offer something new & different.
B005MYWZIO|5.0|Great CD altho a bit too short! Purchased for studio, easy listening. His voice is mellow. Heard him on a late night TV program, bought his CD.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Since everyone else has given their review, I'll give my $.02 worth too, for what it's worth - which may only be that. $.02. haha.<br /><br />This book is exotic. erotic. and downright entertaining. I've read many of the 1 and 2 star reviews that pretty much LOATHE the writing style - and yes...I will agree the writing style isn't exactly a literary masterpiece, but it's not MEANT to be!<br /><br />I have to say, I'm actually surprised at the amount of sex scenes in this book...with all the hype surrounding it - I truly thought there was MORE. I honestly didn't realize, when I finally got it to read on my kindle that it wasn't all-encompasing 100% sex the entire way through.<br /><br />The sex scenes were hot, but they're also not all THAT graphic. I've read some other erotica (very little, although thanks to this book plan on reading more! lol) in which the language for the sex scenes were much more intense!<br /><br />Honestly, though, there's not nearly as many sex scenes as I expected and the story line is pretty good, just waiting to see what each character will do next...Christian becoming more of the 'boyfriend-type' and NOT so controlling and what his boundaries are as far as becoming a \\"normal\\" guy as well as what Anastasia will allow herself to get into.<br /><br />Yes this will open your eyes up to the BDSM scene, if you're not familiar with it...which I'm not but I'm also not dumb to it either. I consider myself \\"worldly\\" if that's what you'd call it - knowing about stuff such as \\"safe words\\" and whatnot. Hey I've got HBO and the real sex series is informative! lol.<br /><br />I'm excited to start the second book to see the character development of Anastasia. It is interesting to read a book about a man who wants 100% control. I don't exactly consider myself a feminist and can somewhat understand the want of a woman of a man to take control in the bedroom - however I will say it's strange to read a book where the man is so incredibly controlling in otherways when we're taught in this society that a man should NEVER control a woman. Shoot, I get mad when my husband gets upset at me for leaving a dish in the sink (he is a neat-freak).<br /><br />One thing I found irritating about this book was the over-use of \\"big words\\". I consider myself fairly intelligent, but when most of the book DOES seem like it was written by someone who barely had an editor, I've had to use the dictionary function on my kindle throughout a lot of the book to understand what a lot of words the author throws in means.<br /><br />Overall, it's a very entertaining book. I would absolutely recommend it to anyone, but just know you're NOT reading the book for its literary intelligence but just for some downright fun erotic entertainment!

B0074YVW1G|5.0|This text has helped me understand myself and those around me. As an introvert who strove (until now) to \\"fit in\\" I was always scared and puzzled by the lack of empathy and tolerance of the \\"noisy\\" majority.<br />This text has tremendous value as a tool for self awareness and I will always come back to it to help unpack issues of self that are unresolved. I will also return to it because it has wider implications, particularly in art. The rise of the culture of personality corresponded to the rise of modernism and post-modernism in literature and the arts and understanding some of the social mechanisms at play via this book has been very valuable to me. The observations of artists and writers (many if not all must be creative introverts) articulated in the art and literature of the twentieth century make much more sense to me as I read this book.

0142418471|3.0|When I first heard about Will Grayson, Will Grayson, I didn't really look much into it. I figured the synopsis I had heard from Paul and from reading the back of the book was pretty indicative of what the book would be about. Two boys, both named Will Grayson, who meet and change each other's lives. Simple enough, right?<br /><br />Well, while that's what happens, it does not even scratch the surface of what the book is actually about. I was not expecting the book to be as gay as it was, and it definitely surprised me. I haven't read anything as gay as this book - not because I have any problem with LGBTQ books, but simply because I have just never read much in that subgenre - and this was quite a dive into that arena. After the initial shock, I really appreciated that though. It's nice to go into something completely unaware sometimes and see how things turn out.<br /><br />From the first meeting with Tiny, I knew I would like him. While Will Grayson seems to be annoyed with him most of the time, it never comes across as him disliking Tiny. And Tiny is so confident and sure of himself, how could you not like the kid? He's a huge kid who goes by \\"Tiny,\\" he's a star football player, active in several clubs, writes and directs his own musical, and is extremely gay. And the whole time, I wanted to be his friend.<br /><br />I also liked Will Grayson. Although he seemed to want to just fade into the crowd, he wasn't really all that unhappy with his life and his friends. Plus, he acts like a realistic high school kid. Not popular, but not without any friends. Just somewhere in the middle, and not too upset about that. His growth over the course of the novel though is really interesting, and I love how he comes to appreciate Tiny and everything else so much more by the end of the novel.<br /><br />will grayson though, he drove me crazy. I would NOT have wanted to be his friend. I understand being depressed and being on medication and all of the other things wrong with him, but I didn't like his attitude, or how he treats his \\"friend\\" or how he doesn't use any capitalization and very little punctuation. He also grows and learns and changes over the course of the novel, but I still was not a fan.<br /><br />I think I would have liked this book more if will grayson hadn't driven me so crazy. I really liked how being gay in high school was dealt with. I think the juxtaposition of Tiny with will grayson was done well, and the way Tiny brings will out of his shell is incredible. Especially after the whole Maura thing. And I loved how by the end, Tiny finally gets to feel appreciated. Sometimes, I felt the book was more about Tiny than about the Will Graysons.<br /><br />Having the authors write every other chapters was pretty neat, and reading the interview in the back between them really added to the book. At least I thought so, anyway.<br /><br />I'm interested in reading more LGBTQ YA novels, especially if I know ahead of time what I'm getting into.<br /><br />I give this book a 3/5, and recommend it to anyone who enjoys YA novels about teens growing and maturing.but I didn't like his attitude, or how he treats his \\"friend\\" or how he doesn't use any capitalization and very little punctuation.

B0041KKYBA|3.0|No one account has yet emerged that does justice to the entire financial disaster of four years ago.  This doco hits hard indeed at collusion between the financial sector and the federal government. But one must look elsewhere for accounts of how Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, with their nod/wink attitude to the risk they were exposing the taxpayers to, help ignite the crisis as well. Ditto for how the feds \\"encouraged\\" lenders, in the name of fairness, to make loans to people who could never pay them back and had no business taking them out.<br /><br />That said, Wall Street must shoulder the majority of the blame.  The quants--smart young math whizzes hired by financial firms to oversee complex investing formulas--don't figure in this film.  But they were particularly destructive.  All intellect and no empathy for the casualties of their maneuverings, they only saw that they could hit their quarterly numbers and score their bonuses if they ran everyone else's financial affairs off the road. And so off the road we went.<br /><br />Cinematically, the film is rather repetitive.  Practically every transitional shot is an overhead view of Manhattan--we peer down an extraordinary number of ceiling vents.  The interviews are edited into highly shaped tropes: I-told-them-so vindications  from critics; self-damning gaffes from squirming ex-officials.  But the shots of the abandoned, foreclosed homes in stillborn neighborhoods are emblematic of the current times.<br /><br />Surprisingly, the film is rough on President Obama, depicting him as having been stared down by the money men.  Since this film is an expose', there's not much discussion on what the filmmakers think should be done with the financial sector, other than unspecified regulation.<br /><br />So, if you believe that Wall Street and the Treasury Department are connected with a revolving door, this film is for you.  If you believe in the infallibility of free markets, take a good look around, and then see this film.  The free market has been a boon for most of us, most of our lives.  But none of the works of Man are infallible..  The free market has been a boon for most of us, most of our lives.  But none of the works of Man are infallible.

0143038419|1.0|First, I am not one to write reviews typically. However, I have been reading this book while traveling to, ironically, Italy and India amongst many other countries. My travels were a mix of fun and work over a span of 5 weeks. I enjoy traveling to meet new people and see new things. I also enjoy having this time to myself to get back to my needs and focus where I am going in life. I just don't hide behind travel to think that it will make me more of a person.<br /><br />I admire her openness and her willing to write about herself and let the world read. I do believe that there are people out there that are like her. I swear I have dated her twin. They are running away from who they are and hiding behind who they think they are.<br /><br />My warning to those not trying to find themselves through someone else, it may be...um...shallow to you. I am not saying you shouldn't read the book, it is always good to see the world through others eyes.
0425263908|3.0|I bought this because it was a recommendation for those who like the Fifty Shades books.  I was disappointed, actually.  To me the characters are not as well developed as those in Fifty Shades and the writing style in Fifty Shades is just more to my liking.  Perhaps if I had read this BEFORE Fifty Shades I would feel differently.  I don't think I will be purchasing the second book of this series.

1594744769|4.0|The book \\"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children\\" is about a young boy named Jacob who was told many stories by his Granpa Portman about a home with peculiar children. Later in Jacob's life Grandpa Portman dies from unknown causes, and leaves Jacob on a hunt to find the home of the peculiar children.<br />The book started off slow, but was very informational setting up the plot. Once I read a few pages into the book, the story became very interesting. The description and pictures of the characters and their abilities help the reader really visualize each individual. It's as if you're seeing each character face to face. When I read this book I felt as if I was really with Jacob on his adventure. The imagery helped create the setting and create the mood. This book was a fast-paced book, and it's really easy to read.<br />I think this is a fantastic book, and I would recommend it to anyone. Ransom Riggs wrote a book that catches any reader's attention, and it defently caught mine.

0345803507|3.0|I've been hearing about this series for weeks but I didn't want to spend money on something I didn't think I'd like all that well.  Boy am I glad I didn't spend a dime on this.  I borrowed the books from a friend and I'm about midway thru the third one and I have to say I don't think much of them.  Yes, I'm still reading them because of the sex.  I enjoy a little erotica and that's the only reason I'm giving these books 3 stars.<br /><br />Otherwise there's no character development beyond the main two characters and not that much even with them.  The plot is very thin and revolves entirely around these two fighting and having sex, then they argue and have sex, and just for a change of pace they disagree and have sex.  As with most porn the sex isn't very realistic or believable.  I admit to getting a bit aroused by it more than once and that's why I've continued to read past the first book and why I'm giving them 3 stars instead of 1.<br /><br />The author originally posted this as Twilight fanfic. I know there are those that will disagree with me but I wish these books were as good as the Twilight series. Twilight has characters that I know and care about. For the most part I really enjoyed the plot and sub-plots of Twilight. They aren't my favorite books but I'd rate them much higher than Fifty Shades.<br /><br />I know she sold the movie rights but I don't see how anyone but a porn company will be able to make a movie of this story unless they get a screen writer to completely re-write it and create a storyline where none exists.

0307719774|5.0|I really do love writing in this journal. It's better than a diary because it asks you questions. There is pretty much an answer everyday even if your day wasnt eventful. Some of the questions are confusing or strange but I don't mind. The book itself looks very nice. The pages are outlined in gold. Overall, I would recommend this journal. Plus, Amazon shipped it very very fast. I believe it only took 2 business days for me.

B003VR5PPY|5.0|I'll say my CONCLUSION first:<br />if you love visual novels, puzzles, survival/mystery games, and can stand trial and error and repetitive games...i definitely think you will enjoy this game.<br /><br />---------------------<br /><br />(READ BELOW for my actual review. sorry this is really long.)<br /><br />---------------------<br /><br />THIS IS FOR ALL YOU PEOPLE WHO THINK THIS GAME IS HORRIBLE AND WANT TO GIVE IT A BAD RATING:<br /><br />Only people who have completely finished the whole game and got all the endings...have a right to say whether it's bad or not. seriously.<br /><br />For all you people who have this game and/or have started playing it, and then think this game is \\"horrible,\\"...i'd bet a lot of money that you only got one or two endings, if that. before you judge this game and say its bad, diss it, and give it 1 star ratings...actually play it to the end and get the true ending before you quit. if you actually do completely finish the game and STILL hate it, give an actual reason why, not just say \\"it's not really a game...\\" or \\"there's too much reading.\\"<br /><br />i'm really tired of seeing people give a great game a 1 star rating just because of their stupidity of buying a game they wouldn't like in the first place.<br /><br />its as SIMPLE as this:<br />-don't like visual novels? don't buy one.<br />-don't like reading? don't buy something that involves a lot of reading.<br />-can't stand intense violence, blood and gore, sexual content and/or strong language? don't get/play an M-Rated game.<br />-don't know what something is about? read the summary.<br />-want to know what others think about it? read the reviews.<br /><br />seriously, if one is stupid enough to buy a game (or whatever you buy) on Amazon or something without taking advantage of the fact that it gives you pictures, it's rating if its a game or movie, etc. (for example, this game is said to be rated M for Mature), it's summary, all the reviews and the average rating...deserves to buy a something they don't like.<br /><br />---------------------<br /><br />NOW THE ACTUAL REVIEW:<br /><br />i've had and finished this game back in February, but i finally decided to write a review lol. while i know that this game definitely isn't meant for everyone, it's still an amazing game.<br /><br />WHAT I LIKE ABOUT IT: it has a great, original, unpredictable storyline.<br /><br />WHAT I DON'T LIKE ABOUT IT: having to replay many of the puzzles, having to deal with being told instructions over and over again, and having to read the constant text every time you click something.<br /><br />WHAT I FEEL NEUTRAL ABOUT: having to write everything down and have to pay attention to all decisions (otherwise you could get a bad ending).<br /><br />CONCLUSION:<br />while the controls are pretty bad, you gotta keep track/write down pretty much everything that you think might be even a little important, and there is WAY to much text when it comes to instructions and whatnot...if you can get past that, and get over its repetitiveness...you will probably like/love this game.<br /><br />---------------------<br /><br />-i definitely find the storyline unique. while the story is really great, you definitely have to work for it. you cant just play it once and expect to get the whole story. you HAVE to play over, and over, and over again until you get it all...and while its repetitive, i definitely find it worth it. the true ending was really unexpected, but it was definitely amazing and really made me think about it for quite a bit after i finished it.<br /><br />-though i'm fine with all the reading, i mean its a visual novel, what can you expect? the fact that you have to play over and over again and have to deal with all the text explaining everything every time you play a mini-game or something...got real annoying really quickly. also, i hated having to solve some of the puzzles/mini-games over and over again (like in junpei's room where you have to get all the cards and the keys and solve the locks and have to have the instructions read like 5 times). also, the controls of the game were kind of a pain..i mean if you click the wrong thing because its right next to what you are trying to click...you will more than likely have to read like 10 lines of text before you can try clicking again.<br /><br />-i honestly don't think i could've played the game without writing almost everything down. like puzzles i already solved, the orders of what rooms i've gone in, formulas and pictures i needed to remember, etc. though that didn't bug me a lot, its just something extra i had to do.also, the fact that if you click just one wrong thing (whether its a choice in a conversation or if its the wrong door), it could change which ending you get...so if you are trying to get a certain ending, you have to do EVERYTHING perfectly..otherwise you end up screwed lol...that's why i ended up looking online for which rooms i have to get for each ending, otherwise it would've taken me sooo long till i finished the game lol.s and the keys and solve the locks and have to have the instructions read like 5 times). also, the controls of the game were kind of a pain..i mean if you click the wrong thing because its right next to what you are trying to click...you will more than likely have to read like 10 lines of text before you can try clicking again.<br /><br />-i honestly don't think i could've played the game without writing almost everything down. like puzzles i already solved, the orders of what rooms i've gone in, formulas and pictures i needed to remember, etc. though that didn't bug me a lot, its just something extra i had to do.also, the fact that if you click just one wrong thing (whether its a choice in a conversation or if its the wrong door), it could change which ending you get...so if you are trying to get a certain ending, you have to do EVERYTHING perfectly..otherwise you end up screwed lol...that's why i ended up looking online for which rooms i have to get for each ending, otherwise it would've taken me sooo long till i finished the game lol.

B008JH5CVS|3.0|OK, as my title states, it is a watchable action movie.  Main actor Guy Pearce called \\"Snow\\" in movie, is great. Hope he gets in better movies, he has great potential.  Supporting cast not bad, liked the 2 main bad guys and Snow's handler.<br /><br />Now for my rant! warning bit of spoiler in it.<br /><br />Why do they seem to spend ZERO dollars on writers and people with some science and/or physics knowledge?  This movie cost more the $20 million to make, spending $500,000 more to get people to make it more believable would have made this a A movie.  I mean seriously, anyone who's had a high school education, maybe just grade school knows how much BS physics there is in this movie.  Even little things like the \\"automated defense guns\\" don't make sense.  First its automatic, next they have to press a button, next it lets ships dock, next its shooting other ships.....HUH?  It has the feel of a 5 year old coming up with parts of the story.  \\"Well you see their running...and then..and then  a space station crashes into them!!!\\"  \\"YAH\\"  \\"And then the bad guys get really, really mad...oh and he has a scar..yah and well anyway then.....\\"  So that's what I had narrating to me in the back of my mind.  Future tech kinda sucked as well, didn't these guys watch any sci-fi movies before making this?  Red planet had some cool ideas, better then this.  I guess that's what pisses me off, so much possibility and potential and they piss it away.
0812550706|4.0|Another reviewer said this book is The Chocolate War set in outer space and I think that analogy is spot on. It was a good read, but it was obviously written for children. The plot is your standard adventure plot. Young kid gets recruited by military to fight aliens, and along the way he is bullied.<br /><br />The only problem I had with this book is that the dialogue didn't seem real to me. Ender was a 6 year old child that talked like a 16 year old. Many of the supporting charters such as Bonso also talked strange even though they were preteens. Bonso talked as if he was a 16 year old high school punk/jock. It was explained that they were children geniuses and didn't talk like children, or write like children and even Ender battled with this within himself, so I became complacent with the dialogue instead of hating it like I initially did, but even so I still think it was the speech of teenage punks rather than preteen geniuses. If the characters were five years older their speech would have been more believable, but as I said earlier this is the only thing I didn't like about the book.

0307592731|5.0|I spent the first 100 pages of this book saying to myself \\"I hope she isn't making this up. I hope this is true.\\" After that, I let myself believe this is true. A true story of one woman's redemption brought on my self-inflicted pain. She could have left the trail and got better boots. She could have lightened her load before she did. She could have chosen to hike with others, pretty soon after she started hiking. She did not do those things. (Well, she did finally get bigger boots, but they still hurt her feet.) Instead, she did what she set out to do: hike the PCT trail alone. She found herself, and made herself better. It was difficult to ever put this book down, I read into the wee hours of three mornings, after waiting until bedtime to pick up the book. And the last night I so nearly finished it, that I finished it as soon as I opened my eyes in the morning. \\"Wild\\" is well written, beautifully crafted, edited, shaped. I'm in love with this book as a perfect example of how memoir should be written. Great story, gorgeously told. Brava!

1451627289|5.0|I would not necessarily call myself a Stephen King devotee.  I have mainly only seen some of the movies based on his novels, which of course are likely a lot different than the books.  I am a history, JFK assassination and science fiction buff however, and I read enough good reviews of the book to give it a try.  I am very glad I did.  I like how the book took on the time travel with rules aspect.  The main character could not just travel back to the day of the assassination.  He could only go back to a specific day, years before the assassination, live and age in the past.  He could come back to the present and the events of the past would remain the same, but if he ever went back to the past again everything reset and he would have to start all over.  A big point of the book is the past does not want to change, and the bigger the event you try to interfere with, the more the \\"past\\" is going to try to stop you.<br /><br />It is not a fictionalized \\"who done it\\" or conspiracy buff story.  The novel for the most part presumes that Oswald acted alone.  King explains his belief in that theory in the afterward.  An element in the story however is that the main character wants to be sure that Oswald was the guilty party and one of the conflicts in the plot is when is there enough proof to actually kill Oswald.  The story has aspects of history, romance, action, suspense and morality questions.  There are also several side stories that go on in the years leading up to the assassination, so while that is the overall theme of the book, there is more to the story than that.<br /><br />Obviously I cannot say for certain that everyone will like this book.  There is a large aspect of subjectivity in liking or disliking any novel.  I am also not sure how much people who feel very strongly (positively or negatively) about Stephen King as an author will feel about the book.  I am not sure how much of a departure this is or is not from any of his other books.  I can tell you that Ifound it to be entertaining, and while it is long a fairly quick read.

030758836X|4.0|Gone Girl is a well-written intriguing mystery with twists and turns that makes the book well worth reading. Having just read The Collector by John Fowles for the first time, I was struck by the parallels to Fowles' amazing creation. Similar structure, similar POV, use of a diary, and late in the novel, (don't want to give anything away) the similarities become TOO similar. Yet, Fowles succeeds where Flynn fails, and that is with a satisying, believable ending. Gone Girl was almost flawless up to the end, where the author must have struggled to match all the earlier surprises with an ending that shocked. I can feel the author trying to convince the reader of the plausibility of the ending. That being said, the book is still a very worthwhile read. At times, I tired of the unlikeability of the two characters and had to lay the book aside. The rampant contempt for women as well as men became tiresome and unpleasant. Still, careful editing would have eliminated some of this ugliness which resulted sometimes from repetitive writing. The novel definitely raises many questions and sticks with the reader for days.... all signs of a good read. Perhaps if I hadn't just read Fowles' The Collector, I would have been more impressed, but the similarities took away from Gone Girl. Also, Fowles is the master of creating compassion and understanding while also evoking contempt. Flynn's characters merely evoke contempt. Still, her treatment of the media circus we live in was exemplary, and her mastery of both characters' voices superb and consistent (not an easy task). I look forward to reading more from Flynn and recommend reading Gone Girl. Endings are tricky and for me what stopped Gone Girl from being GREAT and instead being merely Very Good, was the ending.

B008KW43TE|5.0|The first half of 2012 has been loaded with 2 fantastic R&B albums: the first, R. Kelly's WRITE ME BACK is an old-school throwback. It's a great homage to R&B of the 70's and a really great listen. The second of these albums is Frank Ocean's CHANNEL ORANGE. Ocean's brand of R&B is much more experimental and forward-thinking than Kelly's, but it's just as good, and in some respects, even better. This release improves upon the nostalgia, ULTRA mixtapes released last year. CHANNEL ORANGE is a concept album that is filled with nuance and attention, and it only gets better the more you listen.<br /><br />CHANNEL ORANGE feels like watching television really late at night; there is a ton of ground covered in the music and, particularly, in the lyrics. There's an occasional commercial (\\"Fertilizer,\\" \\"Not Just the Money\\" and \\"White\\"), but for the most part, these songs serve as different shows. \\"Sierra Leone\\" is dreamlike, and it's atmospheric soundscapes and repetitious drum beats throw listeners into a trance. The next track, \\"Sweet Life\\" is dramatically different in style and tone; however, the transitions are jarring. The real beauty in CHANNEL ORANGE is how different many of these songs are but how interrelated they all are in the context of the album as a whole. After an interlude, \\"Super Rich Kids\\" shows the side-effects of a life lived in \\"Sweet Life.\\" It's an angry, frustrated track, but it (along with \\"Crack Rock\\") provides a good example of Ocean's social sensibilities. It's a song that's both personal and political. \\"Pyramids\\" marries electronic dance music with an urgent melody. \\"Bad Religion\\" finds Ocean trading his priest for a taxi-cab driver for confession. Literally from \\"Start\\" to \\"End,\\" this album works well -- there's not a bad song in the entire bunch.<br /><br />The only disappointment I had with the album was its collaborations. Bringing in John Mayer and Andre 3000, what is surprising is how much Ocean overshadow's their contributions. While I like both of these artists, \\"White\\" didn't do much for me, and in \\"Pink Matter,\\" the slow, spacey vibe doesn't suit Andre's delivery.<br /><br />You don't need to enjoy R&B to love what CHANNEL ORANGE has to offer: it has something for everyone. It's an album that works well as a cohesive whole, but each song here is able to live on its own. While CHANNEL ORANGE is accessible, it only grows better with repeated listening as Ocean's nuance is revealed. Standout tracks to sample/download: \\"Sweet Life,\\" \\"Thinkin Bout You,\\" and \\"Pyramids.\\" This small smattering of songs will give listeners an idea of what they are in for with this album. Be sure to check out this wonderful album -- don't miss this.oth of these artists, \\"White\\" didn't do much for me, and in \\"Pink Matter,\\" the slow, spacey vibe doesn't suit Andre's delivery.<br /><br />You don't need to enjoy R&B to love what CHANNEL ORANGE has to offer: it has something for everyone.

B004VYYA2K|5.0|We love this ZipBin!  Our 5-year old uses it as an extra bedroom since her Barbie house only has one bedroom.  We unzip a couple of the sides to fold down the floor and set it up right beside her Barbie house and put the extra bedroom furniture in it.  Then when playtime is over, zip the sides back up and fill the box with all the dolls, clothes, and accessories.  The ZipBin is very sturdy and well made.  The colors are vibrant and the indoor/outdoor design is really cute.  The lid of the box, when flipped over, has the image of a swimming pool so she can set her dolls around inside the lid and pretend that they are swimming - perfect since I only let her have the \\"real\\" Barbie pool outdoors.  If there were more Barbie Zip Bins with different designs, I would buy more of them to keep \\"building on\\" to our Barbie house!

B004LWZWGK|5.0|SPOILER....<br /><br />I saw the movie in IMAX opening night in Hawaii and it was incredible.<br /><br />The plot was decent: the story begins 8 years after the Dark Knight ended. Commissioner James Gordon has cleaned up the streets but framed Batman for the murder of Harvey Dent. Bruce Wayne/Batman went into hiding in Wayne Manor and becomes a recluse. Selina Kyle/Catwoman robs his safe- steals his mother's pearls and he chases after her. Anne Hathaway's portrayal of Catwoman was more believable than Michelle Pfeiffer and Halle Berry's portrayals in Batman Returns and Catwoman. Selina Kyle winds up working with Bane (the new villain in Gotham City) and lures Batman into a trap. Bane beats the crap out of Batman and breaks the \\"hero\\". Of course, Batman has to have a girlfriend, none other than what turns out to be a new bad guy, Miranda, who takes over Wayne Enterprises and turns the nuclear reactor supposed to provide clean energy to the world, into a nuclear bomb. Fight scenes later and dramatic interludes lead to the conclusion, which was open-ended. At least this trilogy didn't end the way the writers of LOST decided to end their series- lame.<br /><br />Chris Nolan is at his best with this one. The story makes sense for a simple girl such as myself (having never read a single Batman series comic book) to understand. Also entertaining. Bane made sense in this story, unlike in Batman Forever. What the f was that?! At least in this version, Bane wears the mask because his face was torn apart trying to save Miranda. A morphine addict in incredible pain- makes sense to need the respirator that makes him sound like Sean Connery when he speaks, but still eerie.
B007PTJOV0|3.0|at first it was really enjoyable, but when I kept losing I got more and more frustrated. I immediately. uninstalled this app so I woundnt play this addicting game and yet feel really frustrated and sad if I lost.
B004ZRV3AU|1.0|I purchased this bottle cutter recently. I was unable to cut any type of glass bottle with this item. I followed the instructions even watching tutorials on YouTube.<br />Only one of my bottles came apart but the separation started at the 'score line' and ended up further on down due to a huge crack.<br />The cutting 'wheel' is not sharp which is part of the problem and the entire unit is very flimsy. It's made of thin aluminum and the wing nuts cannot be tightened enough to prevent the metal pieces from moving when in use.<br />I don't feel this item is worth the money spent.
B00006CXSS|4.0|My dad is a big fan of war movies, so I purchased this as a birthday gift for him. I asked him if he enjoyed the dvds, he simply said \\"it's alright\\". So... I'm sure it's not bad, but probably not the best he ever watched either.

B007SYWFRM|3.0|At first, it was fun, until it started to freeze up my kindle fire all the time. I wish it was able to give you more acorns easier, otherwise I wouldn't be complaining.
B004TTMYQG|4.0|I basically love everything about this calendar app with a few minor exceptions. I feel like week view may be better optimized for a phone than a tablet.  Also this app neglects to import the colors from the calendar like the native jelly bean calendar app does.<br /><br />Other than that it's great. I like how the week view starts out on the exact day so that I'm not looking at the past unless I need to. I also like how there are a ton of ways to customize the appearances of the various view.  This app was made for productivity and it's well worth the money.

B008MEM24S|5.0|It was awesome! I absolutely love it.<br />You guys should make more Disney games like that.Thank you for making this app!
B008MEM24S|5.0|This is an excellent version of Disney's Where's My Water app. This app is addicting. They got Disney Voice Studio to allow the voice talent to aid in making this game. I would like to see Phineus and Ferb some how end up down the tube and make their version of the mazes.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I don't usually read for fun. A few coworkers were talking about the book and I borrowed it from one of them. I finished all 3 books of the series in less than 2 weeks and for someone like me who doesn't read, that's a HUGE accomplishment. This is a LOVE story. Not and erotic book. While it does have the plus of being erotic, it is so much more than that. I would definitely read more from the author.
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|I can't add a thing to what the other five-star reviewers have said about Blackbird.<br />I have enjoyed listening to Creed and to Alter Bridge's debut album.<br /><br />This second album from Alterbridge contains some of the best music that is being made today.<br />My original copy of Blackbird got damaged recently and would no longer play the first two tracks.<br />I ordered the replacement as soon as I discovered the damage.<br />That answers the question that nobody asked, \\"Would you replace this CD of it were lost to you?\\"<br /><br />Absolutely I would; I did it once already and I would do it again.  It's that good.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I can't get enough. I plowed through all five in two weeks. This is a rich world that deserves a dozen novels and a weekly TV series.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I highly recommend this game great time passer good for any age crongratulation on another amazing game gameloft keep on designing
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I Am 15 and I love it so much it it awsome..I have a kindle fire and works really well! !!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is the first review I've ever written, but felt I had to comment on this series!  I'm impressed at how well the characters are developed and how quickly the reader falls in love with them!  What a great world that has been developed, one with infinite possibilities for sequels that I look forward to.  How refreshing to read a well written and edited series without vampires or shades of ...well, whatever!  Very well done.
0345803485|1.0|I can't even keep reading this book. I made it through six chapters of this drivel, and haven't even reached the \\"sexy\\" part. I find the concept odd - the book seems written for older teens, perhaps, but is someone really marketing sex stories to them? I couldn't believe the all the \\"oh my god, he's so hot\\" variations, as though we just won't get it. Beginner-level descriptions of uninteresting, unbelievable characters. I can't imagine what the sex scenes will be like; not sure I care to find out. This did remind me of \\"Twilight\\" in that it was written for someone much younger than I (who was a teenager two decades ago). I couldn't stay awake to see what happened in \\"Grey's\\" sex department; this bored me to sleep. And that seems to be the opposite of good sex -- don't put your partner to sleep before the fun starts.
B0067EKY7M|5.0|This is a perfect gem at a time when many of us desperately need a thoughtful, intelligent escape.  Here we find hope, optimism and brilliant imagery offering a chance to be more introspective. Throughout this movie, I kept thinking of a favorite quote from Ovid \\"Let your hook always be cast; in the pool where you least expect it, there will be fish\\".  This film offers moments of take-your-breath-away surprise and many small pleasures.
