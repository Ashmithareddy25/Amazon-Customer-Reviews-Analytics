B007U8UBGI|5.0|I've always been sort of a passive observer of Jack White. I always like what I heard but I never actively pursued him and his music, but after hearing Take ME With You on Steve LaMacq's BBC Radio show on the very day  this album was released, I surfed over to Amazon and purchased this album straight away (and I am not a frequent album purchaser at all). This album is lush, gorgeous, and brutally honest (his alternating joy and hurt at his alone-ness is palpable) from beginning to end. The only thing I can complain about is that the whole thing is far too short. I want more!
B006JPS1OM|1.0|I am unable to use this game. The download was very slow, but once download completed, I still can't use it. It has frozen, I can't do anything with it.  t<br />This is the first app that I purchased that does not work.

B007R6X9IK|5.0|One huge reason that Depeche Mode still create quality new albums is because of their singer, Dave Gahan. For the past decade he's been writing his own stuff, continuing to develop and create high level work. His two solo albums are right there challenging Depeche in quality - in a way maybe it has inspired Martin Gore to strive to do better with Depeche. (Speaking of Martin, the Ssss album with Vince Clarke was quite lazy compared to what Dave has done outside of Depeche.)<br /><br />That, finally, brings me to this - The Light The Dead See. Dave and Soulsavers complement one another beautifully. Dave's lyrics add depth to the rich music. Each song is worth a close listening to, and it grows with repeated play. This album stands strong beside his solo albums, and it's there grazing next to Depeche Mode.
0345803493|5.0|If you haven't read this trilogy... stop trying to decide and read it!! Everyone that I've talked to who has read this trilogy -loved it. One solid piece of advice, if you are thinking about buying Fifty Shades of Grey- just buy the trilogy, if you don't you'll be sorry when you've finish the first book and you don't have the next book ready to crack open!! I LOVED this book!!
B007549W62|5.0|This is a well made movie. The story was fantastic. The acting even better! I felt like i was on the edge of my seat the whole time. It was shocking. When I started watching this movie, I didnt know what to expect from the characters. I couldnt figure out who was the gonna be the good guy, the bad guy, or the crazy! I liked how they put all these people together and then showed how things can fall apart. Mistrust, hatred, anger, love, and a whole host of emotions are revealed in the characters.  The film is a glimpse of what could happen and how people can react. It made me wanna go build a bomb shelter. (of course, not let anyone know about it!) I would recommend this movie it was well worth the money!
B0086700CM|5.0|this is a fun game expesly to pass time the only thing I would change is sometimes when u jump or slide it don't respond
B0086700CM|5.0|I think this is the best game in the world! My highscore is 6 million... It is adicting and FUN! Get this app!
B000W4KT64|5.0|Brand new, full screen as ordered, packaged well. A great family film for all to see. I can see myself buying more films of this nature.
B0086700CM|5.0|I absolutely love this game and I am so glad that it is finally available in the amazon market! It is also so awesome that this is free so if you have not bought ot yet you are severely missing out!!!!!!

B007HIEBV2|5.0|I read about Caravan Palace in a newspaper in Berlin and checked out their music a few weeks later. I immediately bought this album and it's quickly become one of my favorites. One of the few albums I can listen to all the way through without skipping any songs.
0345803485|1.0|What a waste of time. I actually enjoyed the Twilight series, but cannot understand how or why this book is a top seller? There is no story and its falls flat, even for a light-hearted plane/vacation read, which is what I picked it up for. I don't read erotica, but I suspect other erotic books have similar levels of sex but with an actual plot and much better vocabulary and character development. I don't get the hype?
145162445X|5.0|It's not a hard read for even mildly intelligent people, however, fundamentalist can't understand it. It's an amazing piece of work. I've suggested it to all my family and friends.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|As with book one I am intrigued by this author and the storyline. The character relationships and twists and turns are well done. Yes, you read many of the same phrases over and over again. We are all human right...and have the tendency to be repetitive just like the characters in this book. I am captivated by the characters and the story...I cannot wait to see what happens in book three...
B004EPYZV2|2.0|Don't get me wrong--I love the movie. It's a lot of fun to watch, which is why I bought this version, which advertised digital copy. My kids are going on a road trip in a couple weeks, and I thought this would be great for them to watch on our Android tablet. I don't even own a Blu-ray player, so the ONLY reason for the purchase was digital copy.<br /><br />We've all seen digital copy advertised on TV. The commercials make a big deal about how you can watch a movie on your PC, TV, and portable devices. Unfortunately, when I transferred this film to my Android tablet, some kind of copy protect prevents it from playing. Not being very tablet-savvy, I'm kind of at a loss.<br /><br />I was going to buy a whole bunch of digital copy movies for my kids' trip, but now it looks like I'll have to find another way to keep them entertained for three weeks in the car.<br /><br />This is the first Amazon purchase I'm seriously disappointed in. :-(
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Thought it was great...reviewers crack me up like they want this to be more realistic...I will never understand that. This is not a non-fiction book so it isn't supposed to be real. Are phrases and scenes repetitive, yes? Do I care, no? I think the author does a great job building up the characters and making the reader want to learn more about them as an individual as well as a couple. I immediately started and finished book two and am even more intrigued...on to book three and I can't wait to see what happens with Christian and Ana...like the Twilight Series I am intrigued by the storyline and fascinated by the imagination with the hints of truth. Keeps me interested and wanting more...
0375842209|5.0|I especially loved the unique style in which The Book Thief was written through the eyes of Death. I felt like I was right there in that uncertain and desperate historical period of time. This book is a keeper!
B0086700CM|5.0|I enjoy playing Temple Run it makes you want to score higher and do better...it gets fast but it keeps you entertained... Awesome Game
B0086700CM|4.0|This game is awesome but it came in the store to late. So I downloaded it on a different website risking viruses! But a few weeks after I got it it came in the appstore! Excellent game, but came too late. That's all I'm saying.
B000086EOB|5.0|This is a must have for any W.A.S.P. fan. This album features a much more mature approach to song writing than the self titled debut album. Of the original titles there is not one song on this album that is not listenable. Highlights on this album include; Wild Child, Ballcrusher,Jack Action, Widowmaker, Blind in Texas, The Last Command, Running Wild in the Streets, and Mississippi Queen (one of two covers featured on the album). The remaining three cuts on the original score; Fist full of Diamonds, Cries in the Night, and Sex Drive (cover #2) would be highlights on any other album but this one. If you have never heard this band before this would be a great introductory album to purchase.<br /><br />As a bonus the Dig includes a live version of the infamous Animal (F**k like a beast), as well as live versions of Hellion, and On your Knees from the the first album. The studio versions of these songs where not able to capture the intensity and feel of these or any of the first album tracks for that matter. These where songs that where meant to assault an audience live accompanied by what was a very intense live show (Long time W.A.S.P. fans know what I mean). Live versions (especially early ones) are glimpse into this assault and aura of intensity that surrounded this band at the time. This album may be arguably one of the best studio albums this band has cut and if nothing else one of the top 3 for sure. While the subject matter has matured over the years this was where that process started to evolve. I highly, highly recommend this album.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|This was my first time using aftermarket CPU cooling and I am extremely impressed.  My i5 3570k was still at 30C after a full install of Windows, AV, 300GB of data transfer from old PC, and an hour of Arkham City trying out the on-die graphics before installing my video card.  I heard the CPU fan once towards the end of my gaming session when it kicked up to 1100 RPM and my PC is currently about a foot from my head while I'm finishing the build.  Amazing compared to the stock coolers I am used to.<br /><br />I will say this may be a challenge to install for some.  It requires a roomy case (it does fit in a Corsair 300R nicely) and having a motherboard tray cut-out is very handy.  Applying the thermal paste is definitely different on this model due the small channels on either side of each heat pipe, but a quick web search will help since the included instructions are very basic.
B003UESJ9M|1.0|Bad acting bad script bad directing especially bad screenplay this movie is for people that can watch anything and not be able to tell the difference between good and crap if you decide to watch and have a brain you will see what I mean rent from redbox if you have to see it. Just bad. I will always tell like I see it.<br />Scott M
B0086700CM|5.0|I want to do nothing but play this my entire life xD want to know my reaction when I saw this in the market? just look at the icon

B0086700CM|5.0|This game is addicting. I don't think it gets boring after a few games; I just got it and have already played over 200 games. It's awesome.
B005LAIH3G|4.0|I saw this in the theater and told my 14 year she must go see it.  We ran out of time and so I have ben waiting anxiously for the DVD release.  I read the book very long ago and loved the story.  Seeing it come to life was memorable.  I am puzzled over why it was panned, certainly Disney could have done better marketing it.  One of my best sci fi movies I have ever seen.  See it, you won't regret it!
B005L38QK2|5.0|playing diablo 3 like a boss! great gaming mouse, perfect for all the macros I set up for my monk!
B005DC68NI|5.0|I was lucky enough to grab a free copy of this book. After reading it I felt so indebted to David Gaughran that I went and bought his two short stories. This book is not only informative and inspirational but it is also very well written. For someone who recently bought a Kindle and started reading books by indie writers it comes as a nice surprise to find such a well written and edited book. I hope aspiring authors will follow his advice on how to properly format and have their books edited. There are lots of fastidious readers out there (I am one!) who will give up on a good story because it is poorly written or full of errors. And he is also totally right about book covers too! If I don't like the cover I don't even read the book description. Unfair, I know, but there's just too many books out there!
B0086700CM|5.0|Just amazing it is very addictive. I played 47 games without even realizing it.not much else to say. just buy this awesome free game.
0345803485|1.0|I started reading this book after hearing much about it. Even thou the reviews were mixed I had an open mind.<br />It was hard to get the main character, Anastasia. Too young, a virgin open to S&M not interested in the money or the things<br />Money can buy!?  Mr Gray is another I just could not wrap my head around, too perfect, (in looks). I think this book could've been<br />Better written, I will not be reading the other two books.  It was hard finishing the first.<br />The S&M did not bother me at all. I just could not make the characters real. Too fake too much exaggeration on all levels.

0062119044|5.0|This book was awesome. I found myself staying up late to read it. The ending was surprising to me. All around great book, no complaints. I really enjoyed Eva's character and Shriver's depiction of Kevin was perfect.
B004KBSQBA|4.0|The anniversary release is going to include the film \\"Under African Skies\\" which describes the story behind this CD.  It's currently playing on A&E cable TV and is well worth watching if you're a fan of the music, there's a lot of backstory there.

0385344228|3.0|I decided to read this book based on the hype and good reviews.  Unfortunately, the book did not live up to the big billing for me.  I look for quality writing and an interesting plot in a good novel, and I thought the quality of writing was lacking in this book.  It just didn't flow very smoothly for me, and I wasn't surprised when I found out later that the author was actually a lawyer by trade.  You'll definitely notice the difference if you are accustomed to reading books by more natural authors.<br /><br />Subpar writing can be partially overcome by an interesting storyline, but I didn't find that to be the case for most of the book.  While the general plotline provides an opportunity for a great book, the actual execution was not there.  Both the lead-up to the trial and the trial itself definitely felt like it dragged on.  The author is a former Assistant District Attorney, but unfortunately he could not bring any major suspense to the court proceedings.  I will admit I did enjoy the last 10% or so of the book, which was a pleasant surprise.  I know others say the ending is easy to predict, but it wasn't for me, so I found it interesting.  Overall though, it did not wow me as I expected it to.
B0058VW36U|5.0|this is a great game for kids.  that I enjoy as a teenager this is a game a recomend for families. enjoy

B0086700CM|5.0|I died a little when I looked at the appstore and saw Temple Run was on here FOR FREE. The only reason I wanted an Itouch is gone now. It runs just as well on my KindleFire as on an Apple device; with the only drawback being the slow startup for the game.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|fun game. but it got too one level and got me stuck and I had to start over. I hated that but its worth playing.
B0086700CM|5.0|This app is SO AWESOME! If you don't have it,or you're on the fence about getting it, I'm telling you this now,1 time only: GET THE APP! &hearts;ME&hearts;
0451232577|4.0|I just finished Fall of Giants and I'm looking forward to the release of the second book in the trilogy next fall.  Follett covers the lead up to WWI, the horrors of the \\"Great War\\", the Bolshevik Revolution, and the aftermath of the Treaty of Versailles in such a way that you hardly notice that you're having a great history lesson as you follow the characters.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|I was a little nervous to try Fifty Shades of Grey after all of the publicity about it. However, if you can get past the mediocre writing and cheesy plot, the story actually does keep you reading. I was definitely blushing at some of the early scenes, but by the end, those scenes get you excited to keep reading.
B0073XORCY|5.0|Great price and great service.  Delivery was prompt. Album was what I expected... GREAT!!!  Ian Anderson outdoes himself again.<br />Bravo!!  The band is as tight as ever.  Recommend this album to all Tull fans.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I loved the darker tone to the second book of the Fifty Shades of Grey series. The writing is still mediocre, but the story has gotten a little less cheesy. Overall, a good read.
0345803507|3.0|Well, what can I say?  I have read 2 of the 3 books so far and just starting the 3rd.  Why, you ask?  Well, that is definitely a good question.  I guess because I hope there is more.  I hope that I'll discover something about these characters that really makes the whole story worthwhile.  Unfortunately, I have yet to get there.  I feel somewhat empty to tell the truth....I want to like these characters and I want to know their story.  But, their development is so shallow and so empty that I am left with....meh?  He's a hot, troubled guy.  Okay.  I get it already that they have amazing sex together.  I get it already that Ana is a little hesitant because of Christian's \\"darker side\\".  And Lord, please don't open another \\"foil packet\\" or \\"bite her lip\\" or \\"set his mouth in a hard line\\"!!!!!  And that \\"inner goddess\\" crap?  Is she a gymnast or an ice skater?  Honestly, she shows up so much I should know this, but I don't and it's because it wears very thin, very quickly and I find myself skipping over it.<br /><br />I will say that the sex scenes are good.  But, after so many of Ana's incredible mind-shattering orgasms, I have found myself skipping over them as well just to get to the plot development.  Oh wait....the sex scenes are the plot development.  Oops.<br /><br />Overall, the book is an entertaining read and kinda trashy.  It is by no means any sort of literature.  But, you know, a better author (with a better editor to reduce the redundant use of words) might've taken the same story and really turned it into a more meaningful story.  But, I've said the same thing about Twilight as well.  Enjoy it for what it is....a trashy, simple read.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love youversion all the plans and options it has is amazing. I recommend this app to everyone. the wake upright plan has given me the streagth to continue to believe in him.

B0063IH60K|4.0|I can't seem to put the game down since downloading it. Now with multiplayer mode it's even better. Solitaire for Kindle Fire has never played so good.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is great on my Kindle Fire. This is th most addicting game out there and it's FREE. Only beef I have with it is that it can be laggy from time to time. Other than that its fantastic.
B007KLKFSO|3.0|Eleanor is returning to her family; her mum, three younger brothers and little sister. She has been away for a year, after her step-dad, Richie, kicked her out and her mum dumped her off with well-meaning friends who didn't know \\"a little while\\" would turn into a whole year. Now she's home, because Richie wants to `make peace' and be a `real family'. But that will never happen. Not when Richie drinks and shouts, leaves bruises on her beautiful mother and has Eleanor's siblings waking up scared in the middle of the night. But at least she's home . . .  sort of. She's in Omaha, about to start a new school year that goes disastrously wrong the moment she steps on the bus.<br /><br />Park can't believe his eyes when she gets on his bus. A big girl, all stout curves, and giant red hair made worse by her army-surplus clothes, random ribbons on her wrists and in her hair and the giant men's shirts she sports. The insults start almost instantaneously; Big Red being the most popular. Park keeps his head down - he's lucky that the school bully and his girlfriend, Steve and Tina, are Park's next-door-neighbour and sixth-grade girlfriend, respectively - being the only half-Korean kid in his school sticks him out enough, the last thing he needs is this `Big Red' attracting attention to him. Except she does. She sits next to him on the bus and now they're stuck together. . .<br /><br />At first they enjoy a mutually-agreed-upon truce of cold-shouldering. Then Park notices that Big Red (actually called Eleanor) is reading his comic books over his shoulder. When he starts slowing down his reading of `Watchmen' and `X-men', he gains a friend. So Park starts bringing his old comics for Eleanor to take home and read. Then he makes a point of asking her about `The Smiths' lyrics on her binder - then decides to make her mix-tapes of the bands and artists she has never heard before.<br /><br />What starts as begrudging seat-acceptance turns into a mutual love of comics, blossoms into friendship and then turns into the most important thing in both their lives.<br /><br />`Eleanor and Park' is the young adult novel from Rainbow Rowell.<br /><br />I have been desperate to read this book ever since I discovered Rainbow Rowell's debut novel, `Attachments' and gained a favourite. I was over-the-moon thrilled to learn that Rowell's second literary outing would be a YA romance. And then I tried to buy the book, and I hit the first of many hurdles with `Eleanor and Park'. . .<br /><br />Rowell sold the rights to `Eleanor and Park' to her UK publishers - so the book would be released there before America. Okay, fine. No worries. I went onto the UK Amazon site and purchased a copy of the book (would have bought an ebook copy for my Kindle, but Amazon UK doesn't sell ebooks to my territory?!). I patiently waited for my `Eleanor and Park' book to be shipped off and land in my hot little hands. Except it didn't. The `shipping estimate' kept being pushed back because, according to Amazon UK, they didn't technically have any copies to send (even though they were listed as having book available?!). I tried buying through an Amazon private seller, which was also fine . . . until a week went by and they contacted me to cancel my purchase because they didn't, technically, have a book to send me. Grr. I went onto the Amazon US site, and even though the book was listed and being sold through private sellers, there was no technical release date for the book to be released in the US. Again, I tried purchasing through a private seller who, again, contacted me and said although they were listing the book for sale, they didn't `technically' have any copies to send me. My Amazon UK purchase, by this time, had its shipping estimate pushed back to two months. So I bit the bullet and bought the Kindle from the Amazon US site . . .  for $17.36. I know! Crazy! Insane! But a testament to how much I loved `Attachments' and how eager I was to read Rowell's second literary foray.<br /><br />Sadly, `Eleanor and Park' did not meet my expectations . . . after all that hubbub to actually read the darn thing!<br /><br />The story is told through third-person omniscient narration, from the alternating viewpoints of Eleanor and Park. Set in Omaha in 1986, Eleanor is returning to a horrible family life after being kicked out for a year by her drunken stepfather. Her welcome home is dampened when she sees how her little brothers and sister, once allied against Richie, have started calling him `dad' in Eleanor's absence and have begrudgingly accepted his late-night fights with their mother and her bruises the next morning. To make matters worse, Eleanor faces a firing squad of school bullies when she starts the new semester. Her looks don't exactly help, she knows; a big girl with flaming red hair and freckles, she dresses to hide the many rips and holes in her second-hand clothing, and needing to shut herself in her room to avoid her stepfather limits her social schedule a tad.<br /><br />Park is the first person to offer Eleanor a small kindness, albeit begrudgingly, when he offers her a seat next to him on the bus. Park is half-Korean; his dad was a veteran who met his mum during the war; they married in Seoul and are still madly in love to this day. Park has a younger brother called Josh who takes after their father in all-American looks and just about everything else - from being able to drive stick to picking up their taekwondo lessons more easily. For this reason, but especially because of his obvious Asian exoticness, Park feels that his father favours Josh over him, and always will.<br /><br />When Park starts sharing his comic book readings with Eleanor, the two strike up an unusual bond - they start discussing and debating everything from bland Batman to the perfection of Joy Division. And pretty soon, increment by small increment, Eleanor and Park start crossing boundaries with one another . . . holding hands, sneaking kisses . . .  nobody understands what Park sees in his awkward big girl (least of all Eleanor). But what they have is special and verging on forever. Until Eleanor's home-life gets so bad that Park has to step in.<br /><br />Credit where credit's due; some things in `Eleanor and Park' worked really well. Like Rowell showing the evolution of young romance - from first encounter to heart-thumping end. What's especially brilliant in reading the building of Eleanor and Park's love is their duel-perspectives. It's great fun to read how every brush of legs and sideways glance is taken and differently deconstructed by the two of them. The simple act of holding hands for the first time turns into an explosively epic encounter for them both. Reading Eleanor and Park's individual freak-outs and inner-earthquakes was brilliant, and will no doubt take you back to your own first romance and the little moments that meant so much.<br /><br />I feel like I should warn readers who are coming to `Eleanor and Park' fresh from `Attachments' - don't expect the chuckle-fest of that first book. `Eleanor and Park' may squeeze a smile and smirk out of you in the reading, but there's too much heavy subject matter in here to allow much room for laughing-out-loud. Overall, I have to say that I didn't love that this was a young adult book, for a few reasons.<br /><br />First, throughout the book there was this constant feeling that all of the young characters were plagued by powerlessness. Eleanor is stuck in her terrible home life because her mother thinks to make the best of a bad situation - even when that bad situation is drunk, scares her kids half to death and beats her regularly. But Eleanor doesn't want to leave her family again; she can't imagine what will happen to the little kids and her mother if she isn't there to keep an eye on Richie. Park feels powerless in his relationship with his father - knowing that he'll never act or look the way he wants, to truly accept Park for who he is. Now, this feeling ofpowerlessness is fine - it's part of Eleanor and Park's story. And Eleanor's story, for all that it's frustratingly heart-in-your-throat to read the abuse her and her family suffers, it is powerful and realistic. But I never felt like either Eleanor or Park rose above their power-struggles. I feel like in a certain kind of YA novel, the protagonist's should be empowered - they should become their own hero's and have the opportunity to save themselves, or each other. I don't feel like that happened in `Eleanor and Park'.<br /><br />I was waiting for that moment - for a d&eacute;nouement in which Eleanor confronted her mother and Park his father - even if their talks with those parents were fruitless and came to nothing, I feel like there would have been power in at least speaking the words. I don't know, it was just very hard to read a book, lovely romance aside, in which these downtrodden teen characters never really get the opportunity to level the playing field a little bit. I especially felt this with Eleanor and her mum. I'm not saying I wanted a scene in which Eleanor whacked Richie out cold with a saucepan (delicious as that would have been) - I just wanted her to sit her mum down and tell it like it is, lay the truth on the line and make her wake up to herself - to even try.<br /><br />I think it was partly this foreboding feeling of powerlessness in the characters that had me hoping that the book would skip ahead to an adult Eleanor and Park. Now, I don't normally love the `fast forward' technique - but I thought that what Rowell lacked in her teen characters could be made up if she fast-forwarded them to adulthood. I know Rowell writes brilliant and complex adult romances (have I mentioned that `Attachments' is superb?) and I felt it would be nice to read a grown Eleanor and Park, when they'd be old enough to leave home and save themselves. Not to mention it would have been great to see if Park's prediction of young romance held true (or if Eleanor's more cynical, \\"Romeo and Juliet were idiots\\" approach won out). Sadly, this did not happen. We remain in 1986, with sixteen-year-old Eleanor and Park; more the pity.<br /><br />I also had an issue with a few of the secondary characters in the book. A girl called Tina takes it upon herself to be Eleanor's worst nightmare - an awful bullying girl who kicks Eleanor when she's down. I think Rowell did a good job at touching on the awfulness of bullying - but the Tina character got away from her towards the end, when she decided to write a last minute `sorta' explanation for Tina's awfulness. It didn't work. It was rushed and random, and would have done better to be teased and touched on throughout the book rather than tacked on at the end. Then there was Park's best friend, Cal. We get very few scenes between Cal and Park, but they were some of the funniest as Park tries to convince him not to ask out the most beautiful girl in school. These scenes were so sporadic and scarce that they did more to highlight how strange it was that Cal wasn't a bigger part of Park's life. In general, secondary characters were, sadly, few and far between in the book.<br /><br />Finally, my last problem with this novel was the ending. Now, I love me an open-ended finale. Unlike some people I don't read them as being a cop-out or indecisive. I read open-endings as the characters leaving us with infinite possibility for their futures. However, the open-ended ending of `Eleanor and Park' is just downright frustrating and unfulfilling . . .  and seemed to shift the powerlessness of the characters onto the reader. For one thing, the last few chapters had a lot of harsh blows coming in quick succession - and when there was that much misery jam-packed, I would have liked a slightly tidier end to make up for it.<br /><br />All in all, `Eleanor and Park' was a bit of a letdown - and trust me when I say that no one is more surprised at my disappointment than me. I had high hopes since reading (and loving!) Rainbow Rowell's `Attachments' - I thought she would be perfectly suited to a teen romance. And while the book had some lovely quirky, heartfelt romantic moments, sadly overall I felt that the YA genre is not for Rowell. Her teen protagonists were frustratingly powerless; Eleanor in her rotten home life, Park in his relationship with his father. Too many secondary characters were left to fall by the wayside and revert to one-dimensional caricatures, and the ending was exasperatingly vague and unfulfilling after reading so much bleakness. I also feel like the book's tagline of `You never forget your first love. . . ' hints that it will look at whether or not young romance stands the test of time - and for that reason I would have liked a skip-ahead in the timeline, to see if finding `the one' at sixteen is possible?powerlessness is fine - it's part of Eleanor and Park's story.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Angry birds time! The developers are the best! =) Well done, guys. It's really hard to make a simple but gripping game.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This app is great fun. I love that it is challenging. At times it gets frustrating, but in a good, I want more way. Love it.
1416955070|3.0|First, a word about the rating.  This deserves five stars for understanding its audience and delivering exactly what that audience wants to see.  This deserves one star for its execution and style.  So I gave it three.<br /><br />Cassandra Clare understands teenagers.  She knows what they want: ordinary heroines with a special destiny, attractive, caustic boys with a burning urge to protect said heroines, love triangles, monsters, magic, and so much more.  She gets teenagers in a way that few of her YA compatriots do, and for that she deserves all of her success.<br /><br />As an author, however, she is middling.  City of Bones, her first novel, is embarrassingly purple and overlong.  It succeeds in understanding its core demographic, in creating an interesting mythology, and in constructing a couple of very memorable characters (Magnus Bane, etc.)  It fails in its language, its style, which careens from painfully hipper-than-thou to melodramatic and back again, and its two leads.<br /><br />Quick word about the story: this is the tale of sixteen year old Clary Fray, an ordinary girl who one night stumbles upon a group of Shadowhunters, demon killers if you will, as they dispatch a hellspawn.  Before long, she and her best friend Simon are on the run with the Shadowhunters, including closeted Alec, haughty Isabelle, and the dreamiest dreamboat snarky angel tortured soul Adonis wot is dreamy, Jace.  Clary runs around with these folks looking for her kidnapped mother, discovers a world of supernatural creatures and a surprising heritage she never suspected, and engages in a 'love triangle' that holds no tension because we know whom she'll pick.  Though there is a nice twist at the end.  More on that later.<br /><br />The good: I felt like a teenager again while reading this.  The overdramatic angst, the wonder, the flush of first love/infatuation, it all came right off the page.  And I'm serious, for that Ms. Clare deserves much praise.  Also, I enjoy the deep incorporation of everyday Manhattan into the story.<br /><br />The bad: the logistics of this world make little sense.  I have a problem with Urban Fantasy worlds where there are a myriad of strange, immortal, powerful supernatural creatures who hide out from the much weaker humans.  It seems like Manhattan alone is teeming with supernaturals, which begs the question: why aren't they running the show?  There isn't any reason, really.<br /><br />I get the feeling that Ms. Clare is a fan of Joss Whedon.  I'll tell you why.  The hipper-than-thouness I mentioned earlier?  That is classic faux-Whedon.  The man has pretty much perfected the art of the pop culture quip and savvy snark merging with supernatural banter.  But Mr. Whedon is easy to imitate and hard to imitate well.  The constant, CONSTANT quips and quirks and snarks will exhaust you after a while.  Why don't these people just talk to each other?<br /><br />And then they do.<br /><br />The purple prose, good lord, it is so very purple and so very, very melodramatic.  Apparently all Shadowhunters come from this place called Idris.  I could not figure out 1. if Idris was in another dimension or off the coast of Scotland or something; 2. how everyone got there; 3. why they all apparently dressed and spoke like Shakespeare in the Park, and if moving from Idris to Brooklyn makes for a culture shock.  Nobody speaks; they DECLAIM.  Especially the villain, who pops in at the tail end with, admittedly, a great plot twist.<br /><br />The ugly: meet Clary Fray and Jace Wayland.  They might call to mind another famous YA couple, Edward Cullen and Bella Swan, except that Edward is more charming than Jace, and Bella has more personality than Clary.<br /><br />I am not kidding.  At.  All.  For all Edward's stalker creep mode, at least he treated Bella with courtesy (when not treating her like a child).  Jace gets points in the 'doesn't keep Clary from her friends' department, but he's rude, inconsiderate, charmless and aggressive for no real reason.  And Clary...likes to paint and has red hair.  I have never in my life read a heroine who made less of an impact.  Even if Bella Swan is warped and twisted and psycho, I REMEMBER her.  Sure, Clary is a better, more independent person than Bella and can live her life without a man...mostly.  But Clary is a cipher, a paper mask of a human face with the eyes cut out, so that the reader can put the mask on and listen as Jace lovingly berates her.<br /><br />Love, it is so twu.<br /><br />I am going to stop this review a moment for a quick chat about this particular couple, and why romances like this and Twilight really irk me.<br /><br />Ladies, I know we all love a rogue.  A madman.  Someone self-possessed and witty, someone who wants to verbally spar with us, someone passionate and intense.  Mr. Darcy, Heathcliff, Mr. Rochester, Benedick, all those great classic heroes.  Except that Mr. Darcy wasn't really a jerk, he was just shy, Heathcliff was a real psychopath, Rochester had...issues, and Benedick was really a nice guy.  But I digress.<br /><br />There's this weird thing going around in some of these YA couplings where abuse and unhealthy obsession are seen as the goal.  Maybe Jace isn't a psycho a la Cullen, but he's rude, he's mean, he's not particularly witty or funny or charming (some character calls him 'charming' at some point and all I could think was WHEN?!), he treats people badly for no real reason, he's self-obsessed, and he and Clary 'fall in love' after snarking at each other for forty eight hours.  Remember that love triangle?  The other contestant is a handsome, good-hearted, funny guy who loves Clary, and has since they were kids.  And she treats him like he doesn't exist when the Angel appears.<br /><br />I know it's the female fantasy to redeem a bad boy/change his world/be wanted by a smoldering, passionate man.  But let's switch roles for a second.  Our story is about a handsome young man caught between two women.  One is a girl he's known forever, his best friend, maybe not the best looker but bright and funny and warm and genuine, who knows him and who loves him for who he is.  The other is a supermodel looker who's sooo good at everything, treats him badly, treats his friend TERRIBLY, and makes the boy forget all about his friend after he and the supermodel start making out...in his room, because he forgot his lifelong friend was there.  He forgot all about her.  Broken-hearted, the smart girl realizes their friendship means little, and the hot mean girl wins the guy because she is hot and mean.<br /><br />Is this a yummy romance?  Or an utter tragedy?  Food for thought, that's all I'm saying.<br /><br />The cool plot twist at the end, that Clary's real father and Jace's real father are the SAME EVIL VILLAIN MAN, MAKING THEM VILLAIN SPAWN AND *BROTHER AND SISTER* definitely puts an interesting spin on the developing relationship.  I just hate this kind of romance, folks.  I'm not going to go overboard and say things like 'think of the children, the developing female minds, oh no!'  You're not going to end up married to an abusive jerk because of this book.  And I know that what looks good at sixteen and what looks good ten years on will be vastly different.  Cards on the table: I just don't get it.  I take it back.  I get why, at sixteen, Clary would be into this guy.  But the author's presenting him as HER ONE AND ONLY, and that is where I get lost.  Inexperienced teenage hormones so rarely lead to the one true love.  Really.<br /><br />And...that's it.  If you like this, this is what you will like.  It's not terrible.  I like some of the world building, some of the characters, the use of Manhattan.  It IS a first novel, and I'm sure Clare's style improves.  But I don't get how this world really operates, it's too long, and I hate Jace and Clary.  I mean, HATE them.<br /><br />Still, different strokes for different folks.  But the next time you pick up a delicious romance with a girlchoosing between a hot jerk and a kind guy, and you're going for the jerk...switch the genders for a minute.  See if it still holds the same oomf.  I'm just saying.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|One of a kind. The author needs polish for sure and this is a shame it was rushed to market. At my age I assure you that if the sex wasn't already experienced in my 20's what a loss! Read all three.

0143038419|4.0|Elizabeth Gilbert is a woman in her early thirties that seems to have the perfect life: the job, the house, the husband and friends, and in the natural progression of things, a baby is the next step to complete that life. But she is overcome by an unexplained feeling of not fitting in to that life: one night, while her husband is sleeping, Liz breaks down, sobbing uncontrollably on the bathroom floor and facing the terrifying realization that she cannot continue.<br />Thus begins her painful, protracted, bitter divorce, followed by a painful, damaging rebound affair. One day, in the midst of these trenches, Liz makes a decision: she is going to drop the ball, literally, and travel around the world in search of her lost inner peace and balance.<br />Her journey begins in Italy, a place that she'd always wanted to visit and learn its language. In Italy she indulges herself in pleasurable experiences of food, cappuccinos, wine, and good friends, giving her body and spirit much needed healing and laughter. Then begins a more sober leg of her journey: India, where she exposes herself to a strict meditation program in a remote Ashram (a place of meditation and worship). She decides to fight her inner demons head on: she scrubs floors, sits in silence for hours and has furious mental battles with herself to clear her mind and sort out its inner mess.<br />It's not an easy journey, but Liz is helped by Richard, a kindly American gentleman and fellow Ashram resident. He nicknames her `Groceries' after seeing the amount of food she eats, and begins to hound and tease her in every manner imaginable, before their relationship blossoms into a beautiful friendship of mentoring and support. Richard is instrumental in helping Liz make sense of the world, be kind to herself, and ultimately, come to terms with her past and let it go.<br />With pleasure on one side and devotion on the other, Liz needs a medium, and so she travels to Bali to explore the last concept of her journey: balance. She is hosted by a charismatic Balinese healer, an old man who practices traditional medicine and who is the next, powerful mentor to her. Liz is immersed into Balinese culture, discovering its intricate system of balance and using it to learn. She is at peace now; she `has never felt less burdened by herself or the world.'<br />The universe would have it that, now that she has achieved alignment with herself, a new love would come into her life: Felipe, a Brazilian gem stone trader who lives in Bali. Felipe has a truly beautiful character, totally therapeutic to Liz's insecurities and fears. He simply scoops her up into intense love and care, and we see a very different Liz from the start of the book, as she is simply able to stop fussing and agitating and slide naturally into this love.<br />Her life seems complete: Liz has closed the circle. In a tantalizing ending, however, she must return to America, and Felipe cannot live with her there unless they do the unthinkable: holy matrimony. They panic. Both hardened divorcees, they had sworn never to `destroy their love' by getting married. But fate ironically smiles at them, as though saying: `Now what, folks?' Thus begins the new book, Committed, the first chapter of which is enticingly included at the end of this one.<br />A heart-warming memoir, Eat Pray Love sold over ten million copies worldwide and was made into a movie. Its strength is its universal appeal to that spirit of restlessness and `What if?' inside us, the moments we all have in our lives when we momentarily think of doing something `crazy,' really crazy. Liz does it. And though there are points in the book when the reader cringes, thinking of her unsettling ordeals, overall, we cannot help but feel a great deal of respect for her. She decides that life is to be lived, comes out of her rut, and pushes the envelope in daring ways that ultimately bring her unprecedented joy and peace.

B0072IVGZG|1.0|The Southern Death Cult(Ian), Death Cult & The Cult... They once could do no wrong but that's all changed now. Actually it started with Sonic Temple. I can listen to all their albums (up to Sonic) without having to skip a song. Choice Of Weapon is certainly loud and in your face but who cares if the songs seem uninspired. Ian Astbury's singing as of late is more like talk singing. like's he's either phoning it in or just incapable of believing in what he's actually vocalizing. As for Billy Duffy? Some of the riffs on this album sound like he's revisiting some of his early (better) guitar parts instead of trying to break new ground. A lot of bands lose their edge with age (Morrissey, I'm looking at you) and I'm thinking that this is probably the case with The Cult these days. Also, everything that Bob Rock touches turns into crap as far as I'm concerned. The wonderful thing about the internet is that what was once so rare or hard to find is fairly easy to locate now. So if you're interested in learning about the version of The Cult that matters to me, look up the following songs: SDC: False Faces, Moya, The Girl... Oh, just listen to the whole album  DC: Brothers Grimm... Oh just listen to the whole album. TC: Horse Nation, Go West, A Flower In The Desert, Judith, All Souls Avenue, Love Trooper, Brother Wolf; Sister Moon, Revolution, Black Angel... Oh, just listen to everything prior to Sonic Temple unless you really really want to listen to Fire Woman. As for my Choice Of Weapon for this Cd? Simple... the mute button.
0131479415|5.0|Agile Estimating and Planning<br />Cohn, M.; Prentice Hall 2006; 330 pages<br /><br />This an excellent introduction to agile for the non-technical manager. The structure introduces Agile concepts in a logical progression assuming little or no previous knowledge.  Those working in government or public services may find this other book useful as well: [[ASIN:0957223404 Agile Project Management for Government]].<br /><br />Detail:<br /><br />The book promises to describe a better way to plan development of products that are difficult to estimate and control using conventional development approaches based on prescriptive planning techniques.  It explains concepts such as `story points', and puts these into an iterative project life-cycle context with explanations of `how to' and `when to'.<br /><br />The title of this book may indicate relevance to ICT planning specialists only, but it is actually a very readable introduction to the Agile approach, and the lessons it gives are relevant to project teams that are developing non-ICT products.<br /><br />Cohn starts by stressing that planning reduces risk and uncertainty.  It supports better decision making, and it conveys information and builds trust.  However, he believes that conventional planning approaches fail because:<br />* Many plans are based on hierarchical breakdowns of activities and teams often allow these individual activities to expand and use up the time available.<br />* There is often confusion over interdependencies and overruns are hidden as they are passed on to succeeding tasks.<br />* Activities are carried out in parallel and prioritised by convenience of execution, not by importance of the features they deliver<br />* Risk and uncertainty are often dealt with superficially or even left out of the planning equation.<br /><br />The Agile approach, in contrast, is feature led, working in short iterations, each iteration focussed on priority features.  Various concepts support this approach, such as story points, velocity based tracking and ideal days.  The ideal approach is for teams to use these techniques in a collaborative manner.  The text dives into some useful detail on size estimation, planning for value, scheduling, tracking and communications (an area that is lacking in many traditional planning textbooks).<br /><br />The book finishes with an engaging 50 page imaginary case study based on a computer games company developing a new product.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|nice game. my kids like it but i dont like how it makes you use real money for basic things like fishing bait. why cant i just dig for worms?
B0052RE4MQ|1.0|What a complete waste of time!!  I also cannot believe this was written by the same author as Matched!  Matched was so much better than this crap. Crossed definitely did not take you where it should have.  It was so boring...nothing happened! I kept waiting for something to happen but it never did.  The last 2 chapters were the most interesting...you can skip everything in between cuz not a lot is going on  except for some climbing of canyons.  Ky and Cassia were boring and not the same couple from the last book.  Ky's character was very sneaky and withheld a lot of information from Cassia. By the end, I was on Team Xander once again. Last note, the switching back in forth in chapters from Cassia and then Ky was so confusing.  I didn't know who was speaking half the time and had to go back a couple of pages to refresh my mind.  I am so glad I didn't pay for this book and got it from the library!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is almost as bad as the Twilight series. Its female protagonist is apparently desirable, but has no awareness of that fact, has no personality of her own, and is constantly swooning in the presence of her male lover. Christian Grey might as well be a sparkly vampire. This book is drivel upon drivel.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is awesome and its definately worth your money Haha just kidding IT'S FREE and that makes it even better. I thought when it came out for kindle. fire that it might cost a lot of money. Unlike some other games where you have to buy things with real money you dont have to because coins are realy easy to get.Anyway I think you should get it because I think its fun even though some other people think it gets boring after a while I don't. I love this game and I think you might too. HAVE FUN!!!!!
B005LAIHPY|5.0|First, let's address \\"suspension of belief.\\" Every movie or TV show requires it. What, there REALLY IS a private-eye like Magnum living in crime ridden Hawaii working for a never seen Robin Masters who lets our Magnum zoom around the island in his Ferrari? You mean crime scene investigators from New York to South Beach to Las Vegas really do work in glass tabled, state of the art, heavily stylized labs? There really is an unbiased media (ahhh! Just kidding. No politics in this review!).<br /><br />I went to see \\"Battleship\\", based on the Hasbro game, not knowing what to expect. Maybe it would be good. After all, there was already a very good \\"Rock'em Sock'em Robots\\" movie (not based on the classic kids game) last year called \\"Real Steel.\\" So...I was really surprised with \\"Battleship.\\" And (semi-spolier alert): thankfully...THANKFULLY...no one says \\"Hey, you sank my battleship.\\"<br /><br />\\"Battleship\\" might be the most fun summer movie since \\"Die Hard.\\" It's a combination of \\"Top Gun\\", spritzed with \\"War of the Worlds.\\" It's funny at times, serious at times and a schmaltzy at times. What more could you ask for in a summer movie?! AC/DC on the soundtrack? Yeah, it's got that too.<br /><br />Let's not confuse the issue here: this isn't \\"Ghandi\\" or \\"Fried Green Tomatoes\\" or \\"The Artist.\\" It's a hang on to your suspension of belief, big Hollywood, blockbusting, metal crushing, Alien butt kicking summer movie that isn't way over the top or goofy under-done. And, they found creative ways to work in the classic concepts of the Hasbro game that won't make you groan. It's a fun summer movie that fits every expectation of what that means.<br /><br />I give \\"Battleship\\" my highest recommendation.
B007SGM084|5.0|I wanted to see what all the fuss is about.  I was skepticle at first after down loading a sample of the first book but then i read a sample of the second book and i was intrigued. So i bought the trigolgy and was captivated.  I could not put the books down. This series is an erotic, tantalizing love story that is tastefully orchestrated about a tormented little boy trapped in a hot, sexy man's body with \\"unique\\" coping skills and the young lady that forever changes his world. It's a dark and enlightened tale that will sweep you off yor feet and have you craving for more....
B007MDB71O|5.0|No spoilers, and not a review, but a passionate rant:<br /><br />This film was fumbled by bad marketing, raped by critics and forgotten by most everybody.<br />It pisses me off in a over 40 fanboy way.  I feel towards \\"John Carter of Mars\\" like I feel towards \\"Firefly\\", or \\"Starship Troopers\\".. great entertainments that didn't catch on or were unfairly maligned, and I'm happy to see so many positive reviews here on Amazon.  I saw this film in the theater, and had a great time.  I laughed out loud alot at how audacious and fun the storytelling was.<br /><br />Simply put:  this is a classic swashbuckling adventure story. There's a tough hero, a beautiful princess, a host of adversaries, colorful side characters, steampunk technology, gorgeous Native American-meets-India-meets Final Fantasy art design, great soundtrack..<br /><br />there's also little to no swearing, no nudity, no bloody violence, no deep morality messages about racism or sustainability or how fathers don't love their sons enough, etc<br /><br />***and THANK YOU - no gritty realistic looking desaturated color palette.<br /><br />Yeah, this film is colorFULL- it looks fantastic in High Def!<br /><br />and it has plenty of romantic subtext, action and humor. And critics moaned about how the story didn't make enough sense. I could care less that they combined and altered some of the original books ideas and elements.. it was written 100 years ago.

B0052VUNHC|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, and it was well worth the read.  It definitely had me hooked and I finished it fairly quickly.  My only issue with it is that after recently reading the fifty shades trilogy, I found SO MANY concepts to be very similar.<br /><br />But since there is very little originality anymore, I give it 4 stars and I can't wait to read other things by Jamie.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book is so good, I stayed up until 4:00 a.m. reading it.  It's not what I think of as an apocalyptic novel.  Additionally, the characters are not black and white.  Whether or not you like a character, you will enjoy slowly coming to understand each individual and the reasons for his or her actions and inactions.  Currently, you can read the entire first story, Wool 1, for free by clicking on \\"Look inside\\" the book.
B00845MRKE|1.0|I'll stick with my 25th anniversary 5 disc set that has the same content without lenticular thingies and toys. Nothing game-changing about the actual content here and seems like nothing more than to capitalize on us Blade Runner fanatics.<br /><br />Sorry, WB....This fanatic ain't buying.<br /><br />I bought this film twice on VHS (pan/scan then widescreen), on laser disc, twice on DVD (original release, then four-disc DVD) and finally got the blu-ray when I got a player. Until Blu Ray becomes obsolete, I'll cherish the five disc version as the best release.<br /><br />Waiting now for next year to mark the 40th anniversary of The Exorcist. Ten bucks says they do the same thing to the already excellent Blu Ray book release from 2010.
B0066W1AZK|3.0|the game is cidave hard to me couse it does not tell you how to play it.you have to get to know it
B007SGM084|3.0|The story itself is interesting, and some scenes get steamy. However, I found that the editing was terrible. A really good editor, or even a writers club, may have provided the author with a modicum of feedback about redundancy in writing. Using the same descriptors ad nauseum was a turn-off in an otherwise hot novella. I bought the trilogy, but afterward cringed at the price when the writing was taken into account. My advice? Borrow it from a friend, or find it as a used paperback. Certainly not worth the nearly $30 for the trilogy.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|'<br />a really fun game easy enough for the kids. ut still entertains mom and dad. reminded me of old Mario games and lucky charms.
B0086700CM|5.0|You never realize how simple something is while you're totally absorbed in it! Great game for long hours and the grinding rpg players out there!
B001DJLCRC|3.0|I thought this show was an interesting fantasy.  It is set in a pretend world where high school teachers need to work second jobs and don't have health insurance or pension plans.  A magic place where cancer is diagnosed and the prognosis is known in one day.  Unfortunately for the future of this show lung cancer that is amenable to chemo only has an untreated life expectancy of less than a year and sometimes much less than that. This show takes place in a magic place where brilliant chemistry teachers don't take elementary life precautions like get life insurance.  In this magic place, the moral depravity to create a deadly drug that ruins lives for the financial betterment of yourself seems easy and natural.<br /><br />If you can get beyond the above and a bunch of other dreary cliches this show is not bad if you are into the current stream of shows about miserable people and the depraved lives they live.  Vicious people that you would hate to actually know but we all like to watch.  In this genre this show does pretty well.  And the main character is a fantastic actor who makes the show worth watching even as an amoral person.
B007MAETA8|5.0|Having been a fan of John Mayer's since his first live album. Watching him grow as a person and an artist. Has he made stupid, immature mistakes as a \\"person?\\" Of course. Everyone has, but his are on supermarket tabloids.<br /><br />But few have been as honest in their attempt to grow and evolve. Born and Raised is a giant step toward that maturity. He explores a more \\"country,\\" sound, but still has the same love of funk and blues, and it comes through. But his lyrics is where John Mayer shines. Revelatory and memorable.<br /><br />If you prefer Billy Joel to Bruce Springsteen; Paul McCartney to John Lennon; and Joni Mitchell to Janis Joplin, you will love this album.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so addictive. I played 100 games when I first downloaded it. I really do love this game!!!
0345803485|3.0|I've read Ana's adventures now and I thought the author was lazy. The plot was intriguing and mysterious. Ana's inner goodess cracked me up, I often found myself actually laughing out loud. But the story could have easily been one book. I felt like E L James did her audience a disservice with the sheer amount of ridiculous \\"*ahem*\\". I would have enjoyed the story just as much, and the point would have been made about poor Mr. Grey's tortured past without about half of it. I wasn't offended at all, don't get me wrong. But I found mtself skipping over (some of) the juicy parts in order to read the actual story. Sometimes the juicy bits just got in the way rather than enhancing the story. And I am not a prude, so it wasn't the kinkyness. I give it a C.
B007JRUCGO|5.0|a movie purchased for the grandchildren which caused pure silence for all of us while dinner was being made.  except ofcourse for the laughter of the little ones.  so enjoyable!

B004SJ3AXI|3.0|Not as fun as other angry bird games.  It is an okay game, I haven't had any problems with it.
0345803485|3.0|Pun intended!! I'm not sure what the hype is about. Despite the fact that it won't win the Booker, you might enjoy the erotica. (Is \\"well-written erotica\\" an oxymoron? I wonder, as I press my lips into a hard line.) Whatever you do, do NOT pay full price.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I think this book is making a lot of relationships come to life. Also getting some couples to try some new things from this book. Amazon must be selling a lot of this one.

B007OXWWX4|5.0|Unlike SLASH's first post-VELVET REVOLVER solo album, which featured a myriad of guest singers and musicians, Apocalyptic Love sees the former Gunner re-team with the nucleus of his touring band - vocalist Myles Kennedy (ALTER BRIDGE), bassist Todd Kerns (SIN CITY SINNERS) and drummer Brent Fitz (UNION) - for an absolutely rockin' 13-song soundtrack to the summer of 2012. First single `You're A Lie' continues to dominate North American radio airwaves; and with good reason, it's so damn catchy! Hands down, second single should be `No More Heroes', another ridiculously infectious tune. The key to both of these gems lies in their irresistible hooks and sing-along choruses. Admittedly, some of the other cuts, such `Hard & Fast' and `Standing In The Sun' - which bears a slight resemblance to GUNS N' ROSES' `Locomotive' with its rumbling riff - are growers, requiring a few listens before they too rattle around your brain long after the disc's done. Mid-way through, `Anastasia' offers a beautiful acoustic intro followed by a superb picking pattern, while `Not For Me' takes things down a notch, allowing Myles to show his tender side. Throughout the entire album, Slash solos effortlessly and admirably; proving he truly is a guitar icon without parallel. The deluxe edition of Apocalyptic Love includes two bonus tracks: `Carolina', which sees Slash hit the talk box, and `Crazy Life', guaranteed to have your foot stompin' before you know it. Also included in the deluxe version is a free t-shirt offer and bonus 30-minute DVD comprised of interviews with each of the four guys, providing insight into the creative process, as well as footage of the band rehearsing and  recording a handful of songs live off the floor at Barefoot Studios in Hollywood, CA. Pity the lyrics weren't included in the booklet, but it's hard to imagine Apocalyptic Love sounding any better; as the only album to top it thus far this year is VAN HALEN's A Different Kind Of Truth.
B0086700CM|5.0|I've been waiting for this app for a while and it was indeed worth the wait. This game is addictive.
B001608QVS|5.0|You can't beat Clint Eastwood shooting people. The collector's edition is awesome. I got all of this stuff for a little over $30. I don't know what the price is now, but these movies are worth owning.
1594203059|1.0|Having been drawn this book by the curriculum vitae of the author as a Oxford-educated, Harvard-chaired professor of history, I was wholly unprepared for the unapologetic and shockingly explicit racist attitudes pervasive throughout the book. In his discussion of every non Anglo-Saxon culture throughout history, words like \\"dumb\\" and \\"lazy\\" are used to summarize entire cultures and races of people from the Ottoman Turks, to the Chinese, to the Soviets which invariably leads the author to the conclusion that every non-WASP culture is inherently inferior to Anglo-Saxons and therefore was predestined to be become subjects to the superior culture.<br /><br />A quick search around the internet has unearthed other statements made by the author that shocks even further. For example, a review of another Ferguson book called Empire: How Britain Made the Modern World, quotes the author saying \\"Without the spread of British rule around the world, colonised peoples, such as Indians, would not have what are now their most valuable ideas and institutions - parliamentary democracy, individual freedom and the English language.\\"<br /><br />This book is a startling wake-up call for those (like myself) who take for granted our existence in a world where the wholesale subjugation of one race by another based on claims of innate superiority is no longer a credible threat. It should be read by others as a cautionary reminder of the colonial philosophies that dominated the Western power structure not so long ago that led to the death, enslavement, and forced migration of so many millions in this world. The fact that an individual who unashamedly advocates a return to these philosophies is held up and supported by an intellectual institution such as Harvard University is shocking to the point of disbelief.
B002KKCWP4|4.0|Just got these today.  If you need good arch support, these are for you.  My arches are a bit \\"smashed\\" down so when I put them on they seemed a bit odd feeling but after wearing them for a few hours I am happy with them. They are better quality than the last pait I had so thats a start.  I will have to see how long they last.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting for this game to come out for kindle fire. Now that's its out...this is the best game yet. This graphics are awesomeand gameplay is the best.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The best book in the series. Very good writing angles. The torment of Katniss thinking of Peeta is greatly written.
B0086700CM|5.0|I can see now why so many people have begged amazon to get this app. The permissions are stellar and so is game play. 100% addictive can't stop! Can't believe it's free. And yes its completely free there is no need to spend money. I haven't even wanted or thought about spending money. They could charge 2.99 for this game and I would buy it again! Very fun! And no reason for suspicious reviews the game is just that good.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This game is the bees knees. I can't get enough of it. Time my battery to the limit cause I play it so long. Lol
B000FC1AGG|5.0|Kinsella's best book ever!  Like all her others, this book had me laughing out loud.  Great upbeat read.  Her characters are so alive ant yet lovingly pitifully relatable.

B003BVFZ4G|3.0|Loved the book all the way through to the last chapter. Could not put it down but the lat chapters just ruined it for me. Really irritating
B0018QQQK8|5.0|As with Message In A Bottle, Sparks reaches memories in a way that touches the heart.  I heard about the movie from Volunteers for Berlin, Korean, Vietnam, Dessert Storm and Iraqi War Veterans and had to read the book.  You will not be disappointed by this wonderfully written book.  Thank you Mr Sparks for your insight and touching portrayal of this veteran's journey.
B0086700CM|5.0|For the Kindle Fire. I really like the new genre of runner games that have sprouted up and this is a contender for top dog.  Its tense, fast, and a heck of a lot of fun.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It's okay. The other reviews written are either really negative or really positive. I don't see what make's it so bad. The writings not the best, but not the worse. I also don't see what makes it so great either. This is one of those books I can't recommend either way. What I can say is I'm not sure if I'll continue the series, but I defiantly will not pay for the other books. I'll get them from the library.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game has kept me entertained from the minute I started playing. the graphics are good and the characters are adorable. long install and download process when you first get the game but it is definitely worth the wait! :)

0756404738|2.0|I devoured the first book in this series, and couldn't wait for \\"The Wise Mans Fear, however now that I am half way through it waiting for it to become a different book from the first and so far am very unimpressed . This seems to be nearly exactly the same book as the first. Unless something really new happens in the next 50 pages I will give up reading it. If anyone knows if this book becomes \\"DAY TWO\\" could they let us all know at what page it becomes the second day? Had such high hopes.....
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is so much fun .you have to try it.go head and play it and i bet u love it.
B0086700CM|5.0|Great for hours of mindless fun. You can play to reach a goal or just to pass time on your commute. Great for all ages.
0345803485|1.0|This book was appallingly bad.  I am sorry a 4 star overall review conned me into downloading this book. \\"It's a beautiful love story,\\" one talk show guest gushed. Oh, please! I couldn't bear to finish this sophomoric fantasy.  Ana's use of British jargon was plainly stupid, since she said she had never left the continental US. Did her character learn to speak that way having studied major British writers at WSU? Was she channeling Tess? Half way through, I just couldn't take another page of the poor writing. The characters? Embarrassingly inane, flat, predictable and boring doesn't begin to describe it. The fact that this insufferably repetitious book was even published is an insult to talented writers everywhere. If I had to again read the word \\"frown\\" or had to endure Christian telling Ana to stop biting her lip because he wanted to, I think I would scream! Really. How many more times could his \\"mouth press into a hard line\\"??? Jeesh! Smirks, hitching breath (what??), cocking the head to one side, murmuring, blah, blah blah blah.... My \\"inner goddess\\" is really annoyed with my decision to read this tripe. Don't waste your money.
B007IE4DSG|5.0|Everything the previous reviewers say about this Gem of CD is true! However I wanted details, there are NO liner notes. I want to know who played drums, when it was recorded -where etc. But it is a beautiful CD.  Giles Martin has once again done a spectacular job! New Rule:He needs to re do ALL of the Beatles solo and re issue tracks. I think what really comes thru is Georges love of music and how CLEAN his guitar style was. More of these please
B000683VI4|4.0|The reason this got four stars instead of five is the cheap packaging. That's my only complaint. As far as the actual movie goes, hello, it's the Notebook. The movie itself deserves 5 stars.

B0062NAX1U|5.0|COURAGEOUS IS A GREAT MOVIE ABOUT HOW TO BE FAITHFUL TO YOUR FAMILY. I ENCOURAGE EVERY MAN TO WATCH AND MAKE A COMMITMENT OF FAITH, HONESTY, AND DUTY.
B007OWG3LM|3.0|This is a truly hard review to write.  Sigur Ros is, without a doubt, my favorite band.  The emotions they were able to draw up to me gives their music a very special place in my heart.  Hearing Aquetis Byrjun was love and first listen; ( ) was the same for me.  Takk was initially a little disappointing for only the first listen but then blossomed into a masterpiece.  \\"Med\\" was a total embarrassment for the first two songs and I wrote that album off; yet years later I discovered Ara Batur, Flojotavik and Festival which really brought the album alive.  However, it still stands as the album when Sigur Ros began their slow decent into mediocrity.<br /><br />We have all been waiting a very long time for this album and when I heard that this album was going more towards the mellow nature of ( ), I was excited.  I bought the album and actually waiting until I had got home and comfortable to break it open; upon first listening to it, I was once again disappointing and let down by Sigur Ros.  I really was surprised in how under whelming, lazy and uninspired this album really is.  First off, the vocals are of course superficially beautiful but Jonsi is not singing in the beautiful expressiveness with the exception of Ekki Mukk)which once made this music so great.  There are no longer any of the beautiful, reverb laden guitar riffs that added so much uniqueness to their music and gone are the emotional build ups.  It seems that Sigur Ros is now replacing their emotional build ups with volume build ups, which annoys me; Their songs now only progress in volume but now in emotion.<br /><br />I love Sigur Ros but, for me, their glory days are behind them.  They will always hold a special place in my heart but I can't see myself getting as excited about their up coming albums as I used to. It is not that this album is bad, it's just that it doesn't have the qualities that I love in their music.  I listened to this album from start to finish and, even though song 3 and 5 were okay,none of the songs were at all spectacular
B0059XTUVI|3.0|A nicely delivered even if not fully engaging tale about the life of Margaret Thatcher, former Prime Minister of Britain, which is mostly told through flashbacks in her old age as her memory begins to fail her. Meryl Streep, who played Thatcher, received Best Actress from the Academy Awards for this picture.<br /><br />About the only issue I had (and it's a big one) is that they tried to make it appear as if all of her victories didn't mean much in the end when they actually did. One could argue there was a liberal bias in this film that took a few opportunities to slam Thacher when they really weren't justified. Thatcher's children dubbed this film \\"a left-wing fantasy\\". Anybody who doesn't know what she did for Great Britain should educate themselves about the woman and no I'm not a conservative.<br /><br />The budget for this picture was $13M and it made over $114M at the Box Office.<br /><br />STORY/PLOTTING: B minus to B; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B to B plus; GOT THATCHER RIGHT: B minus; OVERALL GRADE: B minus to B; WHEN WATCHED: end of May 2012.

B001CS2TFS|4.0|If you're a serious ELP fan and enjoy their less commercial more intricate works, you'll love the title track.  It's Emerson and Palmer at their best, with Lake showing his (often overlooked) technical abilities as well.  I notice a few other reviewers forgetting that Lake does far more than just sing; and some neglecting his creditable guitar work.  It's not just a tecnhical tour-de-force, either: Emerson shows once again that he can really rock out, such as the organ solo break starting at 8:40.<br /><br />If you're more of a fan of ELP ballads such as Lucky Man, Still You Turn Me On, and the first movement of Trilogy, this album is probably not for you.  The two lyrical ballads are embedded in the epic title track, and while they're nice, they aren't on par with the more popular ones nor do they really stand alone.<br /><br />This was one of ELP's least popular albums for a reason, and that reason is that the best work in the album is technical and challenging.  If you're not up to a bit of a challenge, skip it.  If you can't enjoy 11/4 timing, skip it.<br /><br />I can't comment on this particular mastering/rendering.  I got this on vinyl, back in 1972.

B001PU8N0I|5.0|Following up the BBC's epic 2005 miniseries of \\"Bleak House\\" comes Charles Dickens' poignant LITTLE DORRIT, the tale of a young girl born into London's most infamous debtors' prison, but whose destiny is inextricably linked to the lives and fortunes of several others.<br /><br />Growing up the daughter of Marshalsea Prison's most esteemed inmate Mr Dorrit (Tom Courtenay), \\"Little\\" Amy Dorrit (Claire Foy) is a dutiful and charming young girl, who does what she can to contribute towards the upkeep of the Dorrit family.  Following his families' unexpected fall from fortune, Dorrit has spent the entire span of Amy's life locked away in the Marshalsea, where he has become something of a London celebrity.  When Amy goes to work as a seamstress for the ageing Mrs Clennam (Judy Parfitt), nobody, lest not Amy, is prepared for the events which will unfold.<br /><br />Arriving back in London after spending many years in China with his ill father, Mrs Clennam's son Arthur (Matthew Macfadyen) is full of pressing questions that he desperately needs answers for, the most puzzling one being a hand-stitched note reading \\"Do not forget\\", hidden inside a fob-watch, given to Arthur on his father's deathbed.  When Arthur encounters Amy, he determines to unravel the legal red-tape around the Dorrit's fortune at the Circumlocution Office.  Despite Arthur's best intentions, there are sinister forces lurking in the shadows, namely Rigaud (Andy Serkis), a criminal recently-escaped from France with a score to settle at the Clennam house, and a shady young woman named Miss Wade (Maxine Peake), who leads the impressionable young ladies' maid Tattycoram (Freema Agyeman) down a dangerous path.<br /><br />Like most of Dickens' works, LITTLE DORRIT contains a colourful gallery of supporting players, many quite comical (Arthur's jilted childhood sweetheart Flora Finching and her crazy aunt, Amy's sister Fanny and her somewhat simple husband Edmund Sparkler, former convict Mr Cavaletto; and the Plornish family of Bleeding Heart Yard).<br /><br />Charles Dickens originally serialised LITTLE DORRIT between 1855-57, and the same episodic approach is replicated in this miniseries version.  There are hour-length opening and closing episodes with 12 half-hour instalments sandwiched in-between, each one climaxing at a delicious cliffhanger.  Screenwriter Andrew Davies (1995's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", \\"Daniel Deronda\\" and, yes, 2005's \\"Bleak House\\" to name only a few) knows how to write a cracking costume drama and LITTLE DORRIT is amongst his best work.  It can't have been easy to incorporate the panoramic range of characters in the story and let them all have their own individual moments to shine (Dickens was always famous for his extensive range of characters - in LITTLE DORRIT there are no less than 30 notable figures, all more or less tightly tied into the story of Amy and Arthur); but Davies manages to give them all space to be enjoyed.<br /><br />The BBC wisely decided to cast the role of Amy Dorrit with an unknown, and in Claire Foy they found their ideal heroine.  She is everything you could possibly want in \\"Little\\" Amy, a demure young girl, so caring and dutiful to her family, yet unwilling to give away her heart, conceal true feelings or suffer fools.  Ms Foy has since gone on to play the spoilt, wilful Lady Persie in the BBC's revamped series of \\"Upstairs Downstairs\\".  Arthur Clennam is Dickens' most true-hearted (almost too good to be real) hero, a man who is, in the scheme of things, perhaps even more innocent than Amy is, and Matthew Macfadyen is absolutely wonderful in the part.  Andy Serkis is truly chilling as Rigaud, and Alun Armstrong (something of a Dickens veteran with his earlier roles in 1999's \\"David Copperfield\\" and \\"Bleak House\\") is very effective as Mrs Clennam's assistant, Flintwinch.  Tom Courtenay's Dorrit is a titanic portrayal which walks the knife-edge of subtle comedy and unbearable tragedy, and his performance will haunt you.<br /><br/>The only temptation in watching LITTLE DORRIT will be to properly pace yourself and not watch the entire thing in one sitting!  It was all I could do to turn off the DVD player after 3 or 4 episodes.  This will surely go down as one of the crown jewels in the BBC's considerable canon of literary dramas.  My highest recommendation./>The only temptation in watching LITTLE DORRIT will be to properly pace yourself and not watch the entire thing in one sitting!

B002GLWMK2|3.0|First of all, The quality of the sound and video on the streaming version was awesome. Almost HD quality and sound. Very rare for any 70s era concert film. Shows how much is lost from the masters. And you see enough to realize why they were the \\"Kings of Rock\\" from the late 60s through the 70s.<br /><br />As most already know, the movie is quite uneven. Even Plant said it was \\"a load of Bo%%ocks\\". The fantasy scenes are just plain strange. Chalk that up to the 70s I suppose. The performance was self indulgent and long winded at times. Some parts were right out of a scene from Spinal Tap. Though I admit I'm not a huge fan, I've never seen a great live Led Zeppelin performance on film yet, and this didn't change anything. Mediocre at best. Very loose performances of some of their hits and long boring solos that go on forever.<br /><br />I remember this film being a staple of \\"Midnight Movies\\" when I was a kid in the 70s and I always wondered what all the fuss was about. Now I know I wasn't missing much. This film was meant to be viewed stoned I suppose. Some of the most interesting bits were of the behind the scenes stuff. They could have made a much better film if they'd skipped some of the fantasy sequences and put more of that in there. The shot of the first song from above, when the lights go on and the first notes are played, was amazing, but it was mostly down hill from there. This concert came late in a long tour and you can tell the band are tired of playing songs straight up. They just tend to venture off in self-indulgent directions as a result. I was left wondering if they were even capable of playing the songs as recorded or were they just bored. I suspect the latter, as moment of sheer brilliance did occur. Not that live performances need to sound exactly like the recording, but at times I couldn't even recognize the songs.<br /><br />I was left with an even greater appreciation of Page's, and even Bonham's playing. Bonham seemed as if he was going to destroy his drum set he was hitting so hard. Its apparent Page really was the heart of that band, though Jones steady contribution can not be ignored. Plant? Well you either love him or you don't. Great rock voice. But some of the screams and yells in the film seem so forced and out of place.<br /><br />Reading about the production problems they had with this film, its a wonder it turned out as good as it was. It explained a lot. Like John Paul Jone's ridiculous wig. The lack of continuity. I have ordered the Led Zeppelin DVD because so many mention it is a better record of Led Zeppelin live. I look forward to viewing it.

B002V7TL00|5.0|I missed place this album for 2 weeks in 2003 and I knew it was somewhere in my home but just the thought of not being able to listen to it killed me so I went and got another one. This is my favorite Travis Album and probably one of my favorite albums period. I believe that every song is absolutely perfect and I can listen to it non stop from begging to end.

0385534639|5.0|Best book this feline has read all year! Seriously, I couldn't put it down nor did I want it to end. Morgenstern could not have written a better debut novel. ~purrs~<br /><br />This was one of those books that at first I wasn't sure I wanted to read. But as friends began talking about it and reviews started showing up on websites, my curiosity was raised and I decided to get my paws on a copy. Glad I did, because as I said above, this really was the best book I've read this year.<br /><br />The imagery, tone, plot, characters, and well everything, made for a beautiful story that left this feline wishing such a circus existed. Each tent described was clearly visible in my mind and for all that the only colors used to describe them were black, white, and grey, they all felt real and alive. I've never read a book that made me want something to be real so badly.<br /><br />For those complaining about there being little by way of romance in the novel, my response is that there's plenty, it's just subtle. True Marco and Celia dance around their feelings for each other throughout the story, but it keeps in theme with what is going on in their lives. There are some really poignant moments between these two, and by the end, I wanted them both to win and find a way to be together.<br /><br />I loved how Morgenstern set up the initial basis for the challenge between Marco and Celia. It struck me as being similar to the challenge that was issued in the movie, The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, and a bit like Faust. In fact, when I first began reading the book, I thought that was originally where Morgenstern was going to take it, the idea of both God and the Devil playing a game. If that was indeed what she wanted readers to perceive, then she did a wonderful job in the execution of the idea.<br /><br />Honestly, it's challenging for me to write this review and not sound like a crazy fan cat. There were so many elements in this book that I loved. I really am making plans to read it again soon. I have a feeling that this will be one of those books where I will discover something new to love with each reading. For me, stories like this one never get old.ad it again soon. I have a feeling that this will be one of those books where I will discover something new to love with each reading. For me, stories like this one never get old.

1594744769|3.0|Normally I do not review young adult fiction, but after listening to a few folks talk about it, I figured I would read this novel rather than pass it on to Sara. Unfortunately, I'm now thinking that she would have enjoyed this a lot more than I did. It was an okay novel, but it wasn't great.<br /><br />I had heard rumors that it was supposed to be \\"creepy\\". Sadly, I wasn't creeped out. Yes, the monsters that appear in the novel are a bit unusual and for some folks I can understand why they might be considered scary, but for me, when I hear the word creepy, I think, \\"curl your whiskers and make your fur stand on end.\\" Unfortunately this didn't come close, which was rather disappointing. Looking at the front cover of the book, which depicts a girl in 20's Flapper style clothing floating above the ground, you'd think the book was about ghosts. But it isn't. Bit misleading if you ask me.<br /><br />The other problem I had was that I just couldn't get into the story much. I enjoyed the concept Riggs developed the story around, and I particularly enjoyed the inclusion of photos that are supposed to depict characters and moments in the book, but the overall plot proved to be...Well, the only word I can think of to use is meh. This is a book that is just \\"okay\\". I'm not about to say that I was completely dissatisfied, but if there is a second book, and the ending leads me to believe that there will be, I doubt that I am going to run out and buy it the moment it hits shelves.<br /><br />So yeah, great story idea, but in the end, I wanted more than I got.

0812992792|4.0|What can you say about a book that sent you through a wide range of emotions? More to the point, what can you say about a book that you struggled to read, not because it was poorly written or anything like that, but because your mind simply could not grasp the fact that such actions as happened within the story were true and all to real? Well after reading this book, I can say that it's good. Real good. I mean, leaves you thinking long after you have finished, good.<br /><br />I've read a great many books during the course of my nine lives and while all of them have left me with the desire to learn more about the events or people depicted within the pages, very few of them have ever left me staring at the wall in deep contemplation afterwards. This book succeeded in doing that.<br /><br />I warn you now; this is not a book to pick up with the intention of a \\"little light reading\\". Johnson spares the reader nothing. The story is very much in your face and heavy on your brain. I will even go so far as to say that it will change the way you look at things. Maybe not all things, but a great many nonetheless.<br /><br />The only problem that I had with the story was the way in which it was told. Made up of two parts, the first half focuses entirely on Pak Jun Do and is told in the third person narrative, while the second half is told from three different voices and alternates between first and third person narrative. Now normally shifts in points of view don't always prove distracting to me, but the way it was done in this book made me twitchy. Between the Loudspeaker propaganda story, the third person narrative focusing on Commander Ga and his time spent with Sun Moon, and the first person narrative of the Interrogator, I found the second half to be overwhelming and confusing at times. While I could see what Johnson was trying to do in this second half, I'd have been happier if the Interrogators part had been it's own separate section rather than blended in with the other two.<br /><br />Still, Johnson did a wonderful job depicting how the government of North Korea overshadows the lives of its citizens and I must applaud him for being brave enough to actually visit the country. No sadly, as much as my curiosity has been piqued, this feline will not be traveling there any time soon.er two.<br /><br />Still, Johnson did a wonderful job depicting how the government of North Korea overshadows the lives of its citizens and I must applaud him for being brave enough to actually visit the country.

0345409671|3.0|I read this book as part of the Book Whore Book Club, hosted by Book Whore. When we first started this book I was excited because it's been a long time since I last read a book by Anne Rice. Unfortunately, halfway through the reading, my excitement died and it became one of the hardest things ever for me to continue reading. I've never read a book where I've gone from absolutely loving it to wanting to bury it in the liter pan in just a few chapters :(<br /><br />Honestly, this book bored me! Okay, it didn't bore me at first. I enjoyed the scenes involving David, Roger, and Dora. Part of me would have been happy if Rice had just told a story involving these characters only, but then I guess it wouldn't be called Memnoch the Devil. And I'll admit that I even found Memnoch himself to be an interesting and puzzling character. The book started off strong and was very compelling. Sadly though, by chapter ten I began to lose interest. And by the end of the book I was not only lost, but completely turned off to the entire book.<br /><br />I know that I will more than likely alienate a few readers with what I'm about to say next, but I'm the type of feline who feels that talking around a subject just isn't healthy and given how old I am, I'm not in the mood to play those games. So let me tell you straight...I hate books that deal mostly with religion! I don't care if the book is a National Best Seller. If I start to feel like the book is basically shoving religion at me, I'll happily bury it in the liter pan! The only reason I didn't do that with this book is because of the book club. If it wasn't for those folks, I'd have given up on the book a long time ago.<br /><br />So you are probably asking why, if I hated the book as much as I did, have I given it three paws. Because there are still elements to the book that made it worth reading. As I said, I enjoyed getting to know Roger, seeing more of David, and have always had a thing for Lestat. Plus I feel that if you can get around Rice's long-winded speeches as told by Memnoch, the book itself brings up interesting discussion points. It made me think about what I knew regarding the Creation Story and the Crucifixion of Christ and it made me think of them in a different light. There are moments of brilliance within this book, but you have to wade through a lot of boring/unnecessary talk to get there.around Rice's long-winded speeches as told by Memnoch, the book itself brings up interesting discussion points.

B0086700CM|5.0|It is just so easy to explain because ur just running. sounds boring and lame but its really fun and addictive. u must get this great game.
0441013597|3.0|I will be honest; I've known about this book's existence for years, but never had any interest in reading it. In fact, I have gone out of my way not to read it because I'm generally not a big fan of straight science fiction. However, when author Sarwat Chadda told me in a tongue in cheek way to read this book else our friendship would be in jeopardy, I decided to give it a try. Generally when I get a challenge like that, I follow through on it.<br /><br />So what were my thoughts on this book upon finishing it? Well it was an interesting read. While I liked various parts of it, other parts were just boring. And yes, perhaps my dislike of straight science fiction clouded my feelings and made it impossible to read with an unbiased eye, but in the long run, the book just simply didn't do much for me.<br /><br />The ideas behind the Bene Gesserit teachings and the Fremen way of life I found immensely intriguing. The Litany against Fear especially caught my eye and left me thinking. In truth it was the thoughtful, intellectual moments in the book that were the most enjoyable for me. Herbert poses some truly deep philosophical ideas within this novel and those ideas held my interest far more than the actual plot of the story. Try as I might, I just didn't care what happened to the characters or the power struggle between political houses. And once Paul became the \\"messiah\\", I lost what little respect I felt towards him.<br /><br />At the same time, I struggled with Herbert's writing style. To me it was dry and extremely confusing. The general pacing of events took far to long and often times I found myself wanting to scream, \\"Get on with it already!\\" Not that that would have done much good. In fact, by the time I finished with the story itself, I chose to completely skip the appendices and glossary. Plus, the inner monologues just killed me. Almost all of Herbert's characters engage in inner contemplation to the point where it was overkill.<br /><br />Yes, Herbert createda world that truly was unique, however the actual story just didn't work for me. I've heard that it has been compared to Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy, but if I had to choose between the two, I'd go with Tolkien long before I'd ever choose Herbert.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I actaully lost sleep due to the fact that I was not able to put this book trilogy down!  It has left a void that I have not been able to fill!  I want more!<br /><br />I wish I would have read it before I watched the movie (as my book friends suggested), and now want to go watch it again!<br /><br />Suzanne Collins has been added to my list of favorite authors!  She has an ability to take you right into the story and keep you on the edge of the page!

B006Z10B48|4.0|..Third CD from these German sleaze rockers and if you like lots of loud in-your-face guitars and a solid sound you'll love this. Just two or three plays and you'll be singing four or five tracks here non-stop for weeks - guaranteed! Scream and shout and pump your fists to the rip-snorting humdingers that are 'Money, Sex, Power' (\\" I'm a moola junkie, bucks run through my veins, daily cash infusions, dough is my cocaine..\\" ) and 'Dinosaurs...\\" ..There ARE some GREAT catchy riffs, clever lyrical moments and CLASS songs all the way through this disc. Play loud! Perhaps not as melodic as is claimed, nor as metal, think more a sleaze Kiss but very enjoyable all the same. A GOOD album. I'm taking a star off though since the stomping \\" My name is Hannibal\\" is only on the Limited Edition and the album really deserves to close with this track rather the acoustic jam that is 'Six feet Under' even with its nice chorus..

B002ZFQD04|4.0|I still prefer Confessions over this one. At times, it felt kinda juvenile and cheesy, but she sure knows how to keep the energy going. I really enjoyed the double dutch performance in Into The Groove, the booty popping performance in Heartbeat, Rain, and Give It 2 Me. I think her best performance would definitely be You Must Love Me/Don't Cry For Me Argentina. Get Stupid segment was my favorite one of all. There were some funny moments as well like She's Not Me and the part where she asked a guy if he was a virgin. His answer was  \\"half and half\\". Yea, Madonna always go there. Overall, the show was pretty decent and lively but I do, however, like the 2009 version of the show better than this one.

B007PTJOV0|5.0|I LOVE it. Its so addicting. Some levels are hard but it makes it fun. Its a lot like Super Mario Bros but better. You should at least try it because its free and if you don't like it you can just delete it. ( Which probably won't happen because its so fun.) Its a great app to play when you are bored.

B000YIGNKE|1.0|This adaptation of Jane Austen's brilliant story is laughably bad. The acting is quite the worst I've seen in a very long time--I'm not entirely sure what Amanda Hale was attempting in her portrayal of Mary Musgrove, but the character ended up coming across as very weird and possibly demented. Sally Hawkins was perhaps more attractive than Amanda Root's Anne Elliot, but seemed to think gasping and a perpetually slack mouth constitutes a good performance.<br /><br />Rupert Penry-Jones gave me a glimmer of hope in his performance, but any acting skill he possesses was forced into the background by a truly terrible script. If the writer and director actually read Jane Austen's \\"Persuasion\\" (of which I am not convinced), I'm quite curious why they felt the events of the story needed to be cut up and rearranged.<br /><br />The conversation Anne has with Harville in the book, regarding the constancy of women, instead takes place between Anne and Benwick, outside Wentworth's hearing--which is rather extraordinary, since Wentworth's overhearing of that conversation is what prompts his declaration of love. It is all finished off by a very unladylike and period-inappropriate sprint through Bath (complete with enough shaky cam to suit any extreme sports filmmaker), and one of the worst on-screen kisses I have ever seen.<br /><br />I can't think of a single redeeming thing to say about this film, and forcing myself to finish it was nothing short of torture.

B0017JKEL8|5.0|I'm so in love with this show. \\"Mad Men\\" is a great drama. It's centered in the advertising world around a group of working men during the 60's.It highlights their relationships with their wives, co-workers, and secretaries.<br /><br />This series is ingeniously written, with great characters, and it's extremely entertaining.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|When I unplugged my Kindle, the cord coating cracked and flaked off.  I got on the Amazon site, initiated a chat with customer service and they arranged for a new cord to replace it.

I can't think of a customer service exchange in the past ten years that was resolved so quickly and painlessly.  Thank you Amazon!
B0063IH60K|4.0|this app is alright. I like that you can choose both winning and random deals. and I like that you can ask for hints. I wish that there were more solitaire games with the app but oh well.
B004V7EXO2|4.0|I enjoy this album and find it's not quite up to par with the some of his previous albums. Paul Simon has an incredible story-telling quality in his songs and this is no exception. My favorite of his newer albums is \\"You're The One\\" which has really grown on me over the years. Perhaps this one will do the same.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|Do not install this app ever, it says its free but then it keeps giving you multiple options to buy points and its your kids who are playing it, so I would say \\"its a cheating game\\" they are cheating the parents.<br />1st - you give a free app<br />2. ever 2 seconds there's a \\"BUY\\" pop up and the app is for kids who have no idea about it<br />basically you are ripped.<br />Never Install it!
B0072NWJRK|4.0|An eminently readable book written with great sensitivity and respect to the key players - their foibles are recorded, their imperfections apparent, their strengths to be admired. A manifestly sad story of a horrible murder, and the difficulties faced by police in a country where everyone has hidden agendas, and even agendas within agendas. It is a fascinating insight into the world of the `ex-pat', particularly in an exotic location which itself is undergoing social and political upheaval. Overall, a deftly written tribute to the life of the victim, the determination of her father to identify the culprit(s).
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so awesome it should be a crime to rate it one star and its so addicting cuz I could play it all day long! get this app!!!!
B007FH9GT2|3.0|I wanted to watch this mainly as a comparison to the original version.  What can change in a movie only a couple years old, after all?  I was mostly pleased with the way the plot was true to the foreign version (English subtitled) and the book, but probably had I not seen/read them before, this would seem a little choppy.<br /><br />Was unsatisfied with the ending, and will leave it at that.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|am a big fan of star wars and the movies and extras in bluray format.... awesome<br />totaly recommended buy it now
B0070NSPCU|4.0|I read the reviews on this book before buying it and they were all spot on.  I am fairly new to reading this genre of books other than reading Tolkien and Harry Potter a billion times.  A lot of the books I have read are fun and I really enjoy them but the writing is a bit amateur.  Not so with this book. I never had that feeling while reading this book.  I thought the hero 's character was so engaging and interesting.  Loyalty is my strength.  I can't wait for the next book in this series.  Hopefully, he will write one!!
0345803485|5.0|I really enjoyed all three books! I was hooked by like page 5 in the first book. I thought it was a great romance novel.  I know that the books are unrealistic, but still a fun read.  It did have a bit too much sex in the series, but thats okay. I guess it's not labeled as a erotic romance novel for nothing.
B00008DDHZ|5.0|The  film  is  about  the  actual  events  of  30th  of  January  1972  when  the  British  Para  regiment  attacked  a  civil  rights  demonstration  in  Derry  which  ended  with  the deaths  of  13  of  the  civil  rights  marchers. The  film  is  shot  in  an  almost  documentary  style  which  really  gives  you  a  great  feel  for  the  events  of  that  horrific  day. All  in  all  a  very  real  and  moving  look  at  a  day  of  shame  when  13  innocent  people  were  massacered  on  the  streets  of  Derry.
B0081KTI0E|2.0|I usually like somewhat dark movies, but this was definitely not one of my favorites.  The movie seemed to go for screaming in your face type scares instead of trying to be a deeper psychological thriller.  It had the makings of a good movie, but the scares were too heavy handed and not thought provoking.  This reminded me of going to a carnival haunted house.  Not really my thing.
B001LM1456|4.0|Watched movie because 13yo son told me I had to in order to fully appreciate new Avengers movie coming out.  It was not the best movie I've ever seen, but it was certainly entertaining.

B0086700CM|5.0|This is a great game. It's interactive and fun. I can't stop playing it. Unlike most games similar to this one, you earn the coins fast so you don't have to purchase extra. That's what I like about this game. I'm not spending money just to buy fake money for a game. The game runs smoothly. I had no technical issues with it. I didn't experience any glitches. Overall I am quite happy with it. I recommend it to anyone.
B0086700CM|5.0|its great to pass the time with but its not something groundbreaking ive owned this on my kindle for a while (4share) and the only reason for the ratings is everyones happy for it being released (which is understandable this game is fun and great)
B005KELQEU|3.0|I was replacing the one I had for my Kindle, one of the first one's that has a keyboard.  Since it looked the same and said it was for the Kindle<br /> I was very surprised that it was too small.  I think the item needs to better state that it is not intended for the older Kindles that have the keypad.<br />I'm going to keep it since I this is my second Kindle and the next one I get should fit.

B000PC0U1W|4.0|I had no previous knowledge of the movie or the book behind the movie so I approached the whole thing with no preconceived notions of what to expect. The movie immediately struck me as intriguing and original; I felt myself being drawn in to the mystery and the danger and became very curious how things were going to progress. The movie was doing a great job of involving me in the story and creating the beginnings of a sympathetic concern for the characters.<br /><br />Hugo Weaving does an impressive job as the enigmatic V and Natalie Portman has an opportunity to display her acting skills in a very convincing manner as the young Evey. The scenery and overall ambience of the movie are effective in conveying the oppressive nature of life under the dictatorial control of Chancellor Adam Sutler, played by John Hurt.<br /><br />This is a dark, serious, action movie which I believe more sensitive children and adults should probably avoid. It is very effective in conveying a memorable impression of tragedy, darkness and violence which some may find hard to handle.

B005LAIIS0|4.0|The premise of this film is fairly simple to follow. We have a grizzled and suicidal hired gun who makes his money protecting oil workers from wolves and a plan full of these hardened men go down in a plane crash. What ensues is an epic struggle for survival of man versus nature.<br /><br />What you end up with past this premise is a pretty shocking, fairly brutal and seriously violent series of encounters between the survivors and the elements.......oh and a pack of hungry wolves. For what is a relatively standard nature film, the Grey strays close to the horror genre with a steady, vicious pack of killers attacking the survivors in a methodical one at a time pace. This is almost the Jaws for wolves and it brings back memories of films like the Reef and Black Water.<br /><br />As if this wasn't enough, the film also contains a heavy-handed dose of metaphysical exposition. We are frequently treated to the insights and narrative of Liam Neeson's character's tortured psyche. The characters at some point begin discussing God and how cruel he is to allow these things to happen. Much of this seems natural given the constant sense of dread these characters feel as they are removed one at a time. Still I did find at a certain point that I had \\"gotten it\\" and wanted to focus more on the thriller portion of the film than the spiritual meandering.<br /><br />As to the so-called inaccuracies, do they really matter? When I watched the oft-described shotgun shell scene, it looked to me like everybody sort of used their shells up in one go. The truth is that survivors of catastrophes such as this are often affected by PTSD, as well as being at high altitude in the freezing cold. I am not certain that their actions in any way were entirely inconsistent with a group faced with these circumstances.<br /><br />All of that said, I felt this was a rock-solid thriller that had a brutal pace and some wicked killers. To me, nothing could be worse than running for my life, being chased by a pack of wolves, knowing that I am surrounded. There is something primal about what is hown here and it definitely tappen into my fears. This film is an easy recommendation for both horror and thriller fans. Let the nit pickers argue about the finer points and watch the movie and make up your own mind!a pack of wolves, knowing that I am surrounded.

B007KW5N9Y|5.0|As Christian Bale's introduction film (his first) you will not find another character in the film that does a better job. John Malkovich comes in second in his believable job coming and going in a young British boy, Jim Graham's life. The film takes place in China when the Japanese invade and changes the lives of many, especially young Jim Graham. He will eventually be put into an internment camp and survive in his own way. The most moving scene in the film is when he discovers the American aircraft flying over the camp and Christian Bale does a SUPER job that should have at least given him an Academy nomination performance. He didn't get it but after 20+ years Christian will receive an Academy Award. Empire does get the nomination but not the award. Christian receives the National Board Of Review USA award as the Outstanding Juvenile Performance and Young Artist Awards as Best Young Actor in a Motion Picture - Drama. You will not be disappointed if you see it and I am sure you will want to take action and keep it in your collection of World War II films.
B007MNV5WU|2.0|after reading the reviews about this app I think I'll wait until they actually update the app so I don't have to pay $3 for only two worlds and wait who knows how long before they update it.  P.S. where is jetpack joyride?????!!!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I rate this game 5 stars because, it is not only completely free, but it is actually entertaining! I am very hard to please when it comes to games, but this satisfies me completely!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game so much! first when I got a kindle fire I was so so so so mad! my favorite game was temple run on my itouch so I was happy when i saw it! peace out! bye bye<br />b. wilson
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I've been a fan of post-apocalyptic stories (movies & books) for decades, and this gem just jumped to the top of my favorites.  I recently read all 3 of the Hunger Games books (free via Prime), and, although I liked them alright, they weren't even in the same league as this series.  I immediately had to buy and read the 6th Wool book (a prequel), which was also awesome.  I am eagerly awaiting the release of more, and in the meantime will likely read the rest of Howey's Kindle books.  Support this author and his craft.  Buy this book!
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is awesome I'm so glad I bought it I play it a lot its one of my favorite games
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I have enjoyed every puzzle and have spent hours entertained (and I am still only on the easy levels) Product runs great and I not had a single problem with it! WELL DONE.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is super cool... The graphics are fine... In this moment, one of my favorite games in my Kindle
B0086700CM|5.0|ive had this game on my kindle fire for a while now.. get with the program amazon.. its easy to get games from apple or aneroid market..
B00785P2QC|5.0|city playground is better than the rest because u can actually put it all where u choose.you should really try it.
B0086700CM|5.0|I am in 7th grade and everybody had it but me unroll now!! I love luv wuz this game I'm Sooo happy it came out for android!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game! I'm so so so happy they finally put this on kindle fire!I have always loved this game even when it wasn't on kindle fire!
0307463745|4.0|I started listening to this in a books-on-tape format while flying back from Europe and it got me intrigued.<br /><br />I never liked working inside the box, so the more justification I can find for it the better.  This book didn't let me down, and more than that it has very practical approaches to many of the tiny aspects that make a business successful over the long haul - from start-up on up.<br /><br />I just passed it on to a friend who just got her MBA and is in a start-up.  I think she will find it as helpful as I did about cutting through the clutter of age-old untruths.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|Excellant next step in the MI tradition. Fast, unbelievable, and yet fun enough to imagine that it really could happen. :)
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Well I just downloaded the app and so far so good. No complaints.....Totally fun when your bored.....It is so easy to win points to get access to another.....
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Love love love this app!!! So addicting! Great if you love games like sodoku and mindsweeper. Really get your brain working on the hard ones.
B00005MP58|5.0|I haven't read the book yet, but WOW what amazing service from the seller!  I have seen the 2011 movie Pride and Prejudice, and that is what prompted me to purchase the book.  I also have purchased the older movie that was a TV series.  I'm looking forward to reviewing them later...
0439023513|5.0|I was so happy to see that the ending was very real and not sugar coated at all. I loved this book.  Just like the first 2 in the series I couldn't put it down.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I couldn't wait to read this book after reading the first two.  And it did not disappoint.  The ending was superb.  I have recommended all my friends to read all three books.  I am looking forward to reading more books by E. L. James.
0439023491|5.0|Once again I couldn't put this book down. I loved it. The characters are so well described you feel like you actually know them. Collins imagination is incredible.
B0086700CM|4.0|Great game but it lags in the beginning. Could this be the game calibrating for the tilt each round? Maybe they could look into an update for that....
B007VGXS8M|5.0|I love my Where's Waldo books so I knew I would love this game.  I really have fun playing it but I am doing it on a Kindle Fire and the screen is small for my old eyes.  I play a little each day until my eyes get tired but I know that if you are younger you will enjoy it.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This game is so much fun. It's interesting and challenging, which I'm always looking for. If you enjoy puzzles try this game. Maybe it'll be the Amazon App of the day again and you can grab it for free.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|This app. is so neat - it has gotten me nothing but praise on my FB page photos.  I have many friends asking where I got it from....
B0086700CM|1.0|ok ive had this game 4 ever! if u rlly wanted this game on your kindle you should have sideloaded this along time ago like off of one mobile market or if your rooted off google play store.I uninstalled my old one and downloaded this one and was dissapointed I figured since this was on the market,they modified it to work smoother on the kindle fire...and I was wrong!having issues so uninstalled new one and re-sideloaded it off of google play store.I deffinitly reccomend sideloading.
B0035JRVBO|5.0|If you can only watch one movie in your life, this would be it.  This will be a film that a 100 years from now will be still a classic.
B0086700CM|5.0|I got this game on my Ipod touch and I loved it then it came out for my kindle fire and it's SO AWESOME. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this game. I can play it all day. Whoever came up with this game thumbs up go u. I actually give this game 1 MILLION STARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:)
B005DNPKSQ|5.0|Jim Carry gives a wonderful performance in a film that is worth watching!  After watching this you have to wonder \\"Why are films like this anymore?\\"
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is entertaining and runs perfectly on the kindle fire. I'm so glad they finally got this into the kindle appstore.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|This is the start of an amazing series that is going to keep you waiting for the next book at the end of each day.  Get into Kvothe's story and be prepared to love it.
B00005V0X5|3.0|So, I bought this about a week ago. It took longer then normal to recive, When It DID arrive, It was in a cheap paper bag with bubble wrap. Jewel Case was cracked across the entire case, and slight rip in the cover album photo. The CD is the only thing that was not damaged
B004FOA84A|3.0|Too short! Only took me 1 hour to finish. The game would be so much better I'd it was longer.
B005LAIHQS|4.0|Agent J (Smith) goes back in time to save the planet and encounters a much younger K (Brolin).  After convincing K he is his future partner, they go after an alien who had previously time jumped with the intention of changing history and destroying Earth. Along the way, J discovers answers to the list of questions he has amassed working as K's partner for 15 years.<br /><br />My husband and I saw this movie over the Memorial Day weekend. Tommy Lee Jones has a relatively small part and my husband made an astute observation/comment \\"I don't think there will be a fourth, Tommy Lee is really getting up there.\\" I've always enjoyed Jone's understated acting and thought Brolin did an okay job as a young K.  However, they tried to pass Brolin off as 29 years old, to which J responded \\"those must've been city miles\\" in order to make the timeline work with the first moon landing and other historic events.  Unfortunately, Brolin saw 29 years old a very long time ago. Also, Brolin just does not have the same gravitas and magnetism as Jones. Smith does a fine job, as usual. Z is gone and Emma Thompson (who has had enough work that she is almost able to be mistaken for Annette Bening) is O who now runs the agency.<br /><br />Without the old familiar faces and characters this movie did not have the punch of its predecessors.  However, being a fan, I still think it is well worth the purchase price for the dvd and I would not have wanted to miss it.
B0086700CM|5.0|In temple run, you steal an Idol from a temple, and the creatures protecting it are angry and trying to catch you. The objective is to run, jump, and slide your way through an increasingly fast gauntlet of obsticles while collecting coins to purchase fun things with. If you haven't already jumped on the hyper train, do it now.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The story line is uninteresting and improbable about a college girl who is a virgin and a very handsome billionaire who \\"educates\\" the girl on sadistic sex and tries to make her his \\"submissive\\". Too many \\"Oh My's\\" and \\"Eye Rolling\\" rather than descriptions of real emotional responses. Don't waste your money on this trilogy of trash.
B008518MOW|2.0|The MIB concept of an official group dealing with extraterrestrials living secretly on earth is great.  I own MIB and MIB 2.<br /><br />This movie concentrated on a single given \\"alien\\". And that \\"alien\\" looked essentially human.<br />Both K and J act like super-heroes, not normal people, in that they crawl over structures like Spiderman.<br /><br />And time travel was the major thing in the movie. Not single time travel, but multiple time travels occurring simultaneously. Cornier than corny.<br /><br />Aliens, the very few that are shown, are only secondary to time travel.<br /><br />There was sooo much original background material available to work with to generate great new original stories. But no, they had one cliché bad guy and spent the movie hunting him down. All cliché. All done many times before in many other movies.<br /><br />They could have had more emersion of the MIB group dealing with multiple aliens; e.g., something like Avatar and MIB-1 did: emersion in an alternate reality. But no. Just standard invincible super hero stuff like Thor and Batman.<br /><br />Also there were no jokes to overcome the lack of a story. I never laughed once. What happened to the joke writers?<br />What a waste.<br /><br />Josh Brolin, playing the young agent K, is super super great. You would never know that he was not Tommy Lee Jones. He is the one bright spot in the movie.
0345803485|5.0|WOW! How did this book almost get past me??? There has been so much chatter about how erotic and off beat this book is, that I had to run out and buy it. Not knowing much more then it was a book that was filled with sex and steamy love scene's, I purchased it hoping that it would live up to all the \\"Hoop La\\" . It not only lived up to the \\"Hoop La,\\" but it left me feeling \\"OOOOOO LA... LA... LA.., \\" with a smile on my face.<br /><br />This is a love story between two people that is not the ordinary typical love story, but more of a love story that involves \\"Submission\\", \\"Control\\", \\"Desire\\" and \\"Dominance\\". A love story that most people would not understand or appreciate, never mind except that this could really happen. This love story rises above the \\"norm\\" idea of love. It's way on the \\"Dark Side,\\" the \\"Unacceptable\\", \\"Unthinkable\\" and most \\"Desirable\\". Make no mistake it is a true love story between two people. I'm just so happy that E L James had the courage to put in on paper with ink and share it with us, \\"All the Shades of Gray\\". The author tells a tale, or is it is a tale, of two people sharing their love but expressing it in in a kinky way.\\"Kinky\\", a slang word for most minds to image what it means. What it means.... hmmm.... well lets add some facts to the word kinky, and leave some imagination at the same time. \\"Kinky\\" in this book is a form of Domination, a source of total control over another. One who pushes ones desires to a level that is \\"Tantalizing,\\" \\"Stimulating\\", \\"Incredibly Satisfying\\", a level that is on the Dark Side. A level that is unthinkable to the average, yet its totally rewarding and arousing and will make you pant, thirsting for more.<br /><br />Christian the male  in this story is a powerful wealthy man, who is Dominant in every way. He is tormented with sexual demons and has the need to be in control, he wants what he wants, yet at the same time, allows some part of himself to truly escape and feel true feelings for Anastasia who is thesubmissive partner in this relationship. She is young, innocent and knows nothing about love. Christian is a man who deflowered Anastasia and wants to start a BDSM relationship. He soon introduces her to a world of unbelievable erotic incredible off beat sexual behavior. She desires more and more and excepts the darkness of his love because she enjoys and thirsts for more of the physical satisfaction. He is thrilled and satisfied that he has total control over her, she submits to him and all his demands and he glorifies in this. Christian, gets more pleasure out of the thrill that his partner is submissive and obeys his every command. Anastasia learns through Christian to explore her on dark side that she never even knew existed. Surprisingly, she enjoys it and longs for more. Christian is very perplexed, and ill tempered, but under all his bizarre ways, there is a side of him that is gentle and caring.<br /><br />This book will keep you on the edge of your seat, reading page after page, wanting to see what Christian demands next from Anastasia, making you wonder will Anastasia continue to be submissive. Will their love affair continue? I recommend this book, its very exciting, very hot , go ahead pick it up and read it, I dare you to think outside of the box, and walk through the door ....\\"To the Dark Side\\"..... you just may find your own self some where in this book....
0307269760|2.0|I put many of these stories in a genre where authors rely on bizarre or troubling circumstances to hook readers.  It's a genre much beloved by The New Yorker, but not by me.  I prefer a more nuanced story arc about ordinary people and circumstances I can more easily identify with.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is sooo addicting! i honestly love it sooo much! it is definitely a worth while app. you should totally buy it!!
B005PR2FD8|2.0|Positives:<br />- I thought the CGI was quite good all things considered. If you really like CGI, it's probably worth watching just for the eye candy. The facial expressions are a little robotic and they can't seem to do wet characters (people standing in the rain, looking perfectly dry for some reason). But overall, good I thought.<br />- Voice acting was good.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />- The plot is so ridiculous you give up trying to follow it about 15 minutes in. FFVII Advent Children had a much more cohesive plot by comparison.<br />- For a fighting movie, it's more than 50% teenage girl angst. No joke. Fight scenes are ok, but not as good was I was hoping.<br />- The \\"lesson\\" is really heavy-handed and trite. Humans shouldn't fight each other. Revenge is destructive. Respect the earth. Etc.<br /><br />Verdict: This is a straight up terrible movie. Unless you're really bored, or really love CGI, don't bother.
B000VUCIZE|3.0|Harris makes some good points, but there is also a lot of fuzzy-headed nonsense in here (spirituality, arguments in favor of mass torture as military policy, etc.). It's well worth reading, but take everything with a grain of salt (which you should be doing any time you read non-fiction anyway).
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Amazingly simplistic, helpful, and surprising. Especially the reminders! :-) It helps me stay on track, which is difficult in this crazy world.
B006ZB3V2C|5.0|Kindle Fire owner here: I initially bought Lightning Bug when looking for a decent alarm and ambient sleep-time sounds app. The initial quirkyness of some of the loops (obvious loop boundaries, etc.) as well as other nits with the app have been fixed via updates. Speaking of which, I'm extremely pleased to see how much attention the devs put in to reading feedback and fixing quirks. This app has continuously gotten better, and they keep adding more sound sample sets for free via the plug-ins option. I love the sample set featuring a few ambient tracks from that U.K. artist too - devs, please keep providing this feature as it seems like a great way to both support your continued maintenance and provide users with track suggestions that likely fall in line with their music tastes. Again, great job!
B0086700CM|5.0|this app is awesome. I can finally get in on my fire. My friends would all play it and I can too!
B007M45PMU|4.0|While most albums are auto tuned and stripped of any insecurities - this album welcomes them. You can hear the raw emotion with every track. I hate comparisons. They are not Mumford and Sons. They are not the Counting Crows. They are the Lumineers. A folk band with bluegrass roots from Colorado.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read all 3 books 3 times, and I can't wait for the movie to come out, I just hope that it would be as good as the books.
B003Y5H5EW|4.0|This was obviously a set up for the new run of Underworld sagas, and it could<br />have been a total disaster and we would still buy it, but we lucked out, and<br />it was actually pretty good, all be it a bit sketchy for the first quarter as<br />it twisted around to the new theme.<br />Can't wait for the next one!
B0086700CM|5.0|this is the best game ever me and my brother go aganist each other to see who gets the higher  score....:-)))))
B007N0REX6|1.0|I bought this cd expecting a whole lot from slash.After listening to it a couple of times iwas pretty depressed nothing extraordinary just plain, not one song stuck out. may hesitate to buy his next cd
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is very entertaining....lots of games to play on and also hours of fun. it is extremely cool. yeah
B0086700CM|5.0|very good game even my grandkids like it. easy to use.grafics are good I would reccomend it.hard to put down
B00005NKKZ|5.0|What can I say ?? it was new shipped quickly and it is Simon and Garfunkel brilliant !!and has some of my favorite songs from them on this CD 8-)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Total non-reader, I couldn't put it down, read all three in record time.  Totally entrawled, and looking for more, although my housework and sleep have suffered because of thes books.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game!!! its been a long time soice I found a game I don't want to out down and give up!!!
B0018QQQK8|3.0|Like the other reviewer, I truly enjoyed the first part of the novel. However, the characters do not continue to evolve as naturally and the sequence of events was somewhat predictable. I enjoyed the read, but was slightly dissapointed.
B005FLX2WC|5.0|Wow, what a great combo with these two talented artist joining forces to blow your mind with great musical talent. What instrumentation by Joe Bonamassa with his vocals with Beth Hart and her Janis Joplin type voice and that shivering throat growl of the blues by hers. WOW ! Great CD and will worth the money. No problem with delivery and or price ! Thanks again Amazon ! !
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Excellant story line well written, could hardly put it down.  Purchased the second book before finishing the first one, I was caught up in the story.
0060229357|5.0|My kids LOVE this story and the series as well. We were happy with the product even though it took about 2 1/2 weeks to arrive.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Started off with a bang then slowed down a bit.  About 15 chapters in it is back on track along the lines of the first book,  Nicely done for a follow up book.
B0086700CM|5.0|Ive been waiting for it for months upon months and bought an ipod touch so i could play it. Now i can play it on the kindle which jas longer battery life!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|Finally they have this game! I've played it on my ipod before and I was addicted! Then when I got my Kindle I was kinda of disappointed they didn't have it... They should of gotten this game along time ago! but now we can enjoy it!!! Its super addicting and will keep you playing for ever! great for long car rides! I'm addicted! :)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book. I thought it was amazing, I was a little skeptical at first, but in the end I'm glad I read it!
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is the greatest game ever! I play it every day! You have to get Temple Run I recommend this game to everyone!
B001BKTEZA|5.0|I hungrily devoured this book, and yet, several times, I had to stop to digest the depth and import of a few simple words. Steinbeck is commenting on industrialization, big business killing small business, environmentalism, family, the extended family of the human race...all in an allegory of Exodus and Jesus Christ's life. I can't think of a more timely message for the modern world. The symbolism was a bit obvious at times, but there were also more subtle areas in which he left you with just a hint of import until you were able to analyze it more fully.  The ending gives new meaning to the Milk of Human Kindness. I absolutely recommend this, but at least a basic background in the history of the Dust Bowl and Depression are recommended.
B007VYDFMS|4.0|A very in depth documentary about the life of Bob Marley. I found out some things i did not know. Was shown some rare footage
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I began with Quell v1 and loved it. The reflect version is amazingly awesome. Great relaxer and brain teaser. Beautiful graphics. Learn to play as you play. More Quell, please! Some games are a rip-off. The Quell games are definitely NOT.
B0083GQ2A0|2.0|Not a very realistic story line. I'm not a wolf expert but I think it highly unlikely wolves would venture into an open prarie and attack a group of men around a very large plane.  I think the wolf stuff was way over done.<br /><br /> It would be foolish to leave the plane and not await rescue.  The odds of walking out would be way less. (this turned out to be true in the story). Also they apparently had no destination and, since they couldn't be sure of where they were in the first place, where were they walking to?<br /><br />Sadness and meaninglessness everywhere, in the end he (the principle character is angry against God, so in some sense he admits his existence) very bad ending leaves the audience hanging. In the face of annihilation by the wolves the wallets (representing the best of human relationships) would never be found and  become meaningless too. Very tragic, very existential,  but in reality we can't live that way, and fortunately, we don't. We need hope for the future in a positive way. In the end it turns out that his wife had died also, the letter he had wrote was for her.  For these people death is the end and that is all, very sad way to view life.<br /><br />This moive was all about death, and hopelessness, nothing more.
1904994679|2.0|This is crap!! What happened to the original format of the Guinness book of world records??<br />You had much better and more relevent topics and articles. I am very disappointed with what happened to a decent book.
B00005N6KG|5.0|Great product and price. Very comfortable to wear.<br />I have used Sony products for many years and still have most of them.
B0034G4P9E|5.0|I really loved this movie, yes it was like every other sporting movie that was ever created, and yes all of the MMA fights were pretty basic and the fantastic moments were incredibly unlikely, but it still works incredibly well. The soldier brother always knocks his opponents out in the first minute of the fight, and the teacher brother is always beat up for the whole fight until pulling off an amazing submission right before the fight ends. I mean, yes this does happen in MMA fights, but it felt pretty contrived in the movie. The action (beyond the believability) was very well done, however it was kind of annoying how often the director liked to cut to people watching the fight, but I understand it's meant to instill emotion into the action.<br /><br />The reason this movie is one of the best sports movies ever made is because of the actors and the script. All of the main characters are incredibly deep, and the emotion in their confrontations go all the way through the screen to your heart. They're all damaged goods, but it just makes them painfully human. In the end, you can't help but wonder what will happen to these characters after the credit rolls. I really loved this movie, and everyone should set aside a few hours to watch this, even if you aren't an MMA fan. It also holds up for multiple viewings, I still felt a lot of emotion (damn those onions!) throughout the movie.
0380715430|1.0|I was suspicious of many tales Bill Bryson tells in this book but didn't bother to verify because I read the book mostly during commute so it wasn't the most convenient thing to do. But when I reached the part when he talks about Chinese my suspicion was confirmed. See, Chinese is my first language. It appears that Bill Bryson is more interested in embellishing and exaggerating than writing a good book.<br /><br />This is not the only Bill Bryson book I had to put down part-way. It seems to be a problem with the author and not any particular subject he happens to be writing.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|This was a really amazing film, and it features the best ultra-realistic stylized violence since one of my favorite movies \\"A History of Violence.\\" My only real problem with it is the pacing, which is incredibly erratic. The opening scene has probably my favorite car chase I've ever seen. However, afterwards for the next 30-45 minutes there isn't any action. Yes there are some touching and beautiful low-key scenes, but it just feels separate from the rest of the movie. They've created an amazing character here, and you absolutely feel for even even you have no idea who he is, not even his name. He's a mystery, but I can accept that. The acting in this whole movie is perfect, and the cinematography is very unique. Ultimately his story is tragic, but there is a bit of hope in the end.
1400069289|5.0|Others have covered the specifics about the book so I won't go into them here.  I just wanted to point out this book is up to the standard of excellence Duhigg has set with his NYT, Frontline and NPR work.  He holds up the power of habit like a jewel and examines it from several perspectives, all extremely well grounded and documented. Look forward to your next work, Sir!
B006UKC566|5.0|This was an incredibly fun movie, in the theater and on my LG 3D TV, though there aren't too many 3D effects, other than increasing the depth and making it a little more awesome. The action and cinematography are both amazing and gorgeous (respectively) with the set pieces being absolutely gigantic, however they didn't totally translate to the small screen. However, I wish there had been a better screen writer on the project, as the story and characters are all very basic and/or generic. The whole Greek God and mortal thing has been done multiple times in every genre of entertainment, and Immortals really doesn't bring anything new to the table. I do feel like the movie was trying to be like 300 at times, but it generally bested it, though it may not have as many memorable moments or pop culture importance. Still, overall I absolutely loved this movie, and it was an instant buy when it came out to Blu-Ray. I saw it twice at the Theaters, and I'm sure I'll now watch it multiple times at home.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|I was hooked after the first chapter, read breakfast, morning and dinner just to get through it one day. I laughed and sobbed, such a fantastic journey.
B007PBKG5G|5.0|I first found this band's EP on BandCamp, and I immediately fell in love with the lead singer's voice. She is simply amazing, and most of the songs on their debut album feature her voice with the band just carrying it to greater heights. My five favorite songs on the album in order are: You Ain't Alone, Hold On, I Ain't the Same, Rise to the Sun, and Be Mine, and they are all constantly on repeat in my Ipod. The soul and emotion in her voice should be impossible at her young age, and I can barely wait to hear what else she creates.
B006IMY5ZU|4.0|I recently watched this movie, and I thoroughly enjoyed it, even though I am not even a baseball fan. However, I understand the game, and I think that it is necessary to have a decent understanding of the game of baseball and how the stats work. Otherwise, you will be confused and will likely miss out on a lot of the dialogue.<br /><br />I enjoy movies that are based on true stories, and when I finished watching this movie, I immediately did a Google search for the main characters and events that were portrayed in the movie. I was happy to find lots of additional information related to the movie. However, as with most (or all) movies, it is not 100% accurate to what happened in real life.<br /><br />All in all, I think the acting was very good, and the movie was entertaining. I have not read the book yet (although I plan to eventually), but I would recommend watching Moneyball to anyone that has been on the fence about it (as I was, after originally passing on it when it came out in theaters).
B006JTS5OO|4.0|Being a fan of the Muppets pretty much my entire life, I of course loved this movie. However, the story was incredibly basic, you can pretty much boil it down to being a redemption story where Kermit, inspired by the actions of two brothers and an evil oil magnate, reforms the Muppets and they put on a benefit show. There were also several unbelievable parts (for example there being millions of dollars of oil under the Muppets Studio in LA, and a dues ex machina ending where the evil character has a change of heart), but let's face it, this is a Muppet movie and no one expects an interesting or complex realistic story. I did however, have some problems with the musical numbers. Most of the new songs mainly featured the mediocre humans (even though I love Jason Segel), with the Muppets everyone loves either not being featured at all or only as cameos. Then most of the musical numbers that did feature the main Muppets were rehashed Classics, which while I still love and elicit fond memories, I can experience the higher quality versions (with the original voices) when I watch the older Muppet movies.<br /><br />Still, it was great to see the Muppets in action again, and I'm happy that today's young generation now has their own Muppet movie to watch.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so awesome. Everybody was talking about it on there ipods. But now I got it and I'm in love with it!!:)
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is not for the faint of heart, the difficulty ramps up perhaps a bit faster than it should but the game is superb.  The puzzles are all the more rewarding for their challenge.
B0086700CM|4.0|My sister has an ipod touch and I really want to play games on it that are only on the apple app store. I like this a lot but sometimes it doesn't jump duck or turn.
B0063IH60K|5.0|easy to play. easy to configure and plenty of configuration options. adds aren't bothersome at all. great for a free game.
B0086700CM|5.0|I've been waiting for this awesome app to come to the amazon market! Its great and runs smoothly on kindle fire.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is the best I regimens this game to children ages 7. and up thank you and please take this personal for your child's care
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This is my first written review of a book.  But I had to tell everyone that this book is great.  This is my first David Baldacci novel, but I have just purchased another of his after reading this one. When I started reading it I thought it was an odd book with all the killings.  Then more characters were added and the book developed into a great read.  Lots of twists and turns. I really enjoyed it.
B0086700CM|5.0|Fun and addicting! I have been playing this a lot! Great on Kindle Fire. I have it on my droid x and that is more laggy but this being the first release on android platform I'm sure that will get a fix. Over all loving this game!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game. It's like the funest game ever. I don't know why but it is just so much fun. This game
B0086700CM|5.0|I have played this game before and when I got it was the first thing I looked for but they did not have it I was heart broken now they have it yayyyyyyyy.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|What can I say that hasn't been said a million times about this book. The relationship between these characters is unhealthy. AND IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF THE BDSM!!! It's because Ana is literally afraid of Christian. I mean really scared of him. She refers to his spankings as beatings on more than one occasion and is constantly doing things she doesn't want to do to please him. This is not the defination of a consensual BDSM relationship. BDSM doesn't bother me at all. In fact I thought it was pretty tame in that regard.<br /><br />The sex scenes in these books are misleading and a gross misrepresention of what real women experience in their lives. We do not have two orgasms everytime we have sex. It doesn't matter how great of a partner you have it's just unrealistic. Talk about giving young women a horrible complex about themselves.<br />The writing is not the greatest. I've seen worse though.<br /><br />It's great the EL James is having such great success as a self published author. I know so many other self published works that are more worthy of being on the NYT Bestsellers list than this one though.<br /><br />Why the two stars? Because it is like crack. For some reason, even though you know it's bad, you can't stop. That's it. The one and only reason I kept reading. That and gossiping about it with my friend who was reading it when I was.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Absolutely love the game. Fun for all ages. Its nice to build your own city from the ground up. Recommend this game for everyone
0345803493|2.0|I rated the first book highly despite the appalling writing, non-existent editing, and ridiculously unrealistic male lead among other flaws because I found I genuinely wanted to know what would happen between Christian and Ana. However, I cannot say the same for 50 Shades Darker. If you thought the first book suffered from chronic repetition, then good luck with this one.<br /><br />I will not rehash all the bad reviews that others have provided - suffice it to say, they all make valid points. However, I must say that despite how badly written the books are, I initially thought the idea had potential. I have not read or watched the Twilight series and probably never will so I was completely unaware that James basically plagiarized Meyers' story until I read that she based the Shades trilogy on them. \\"Based\\" is completely innacurate; \\"stole\\" is more like it and though I have no interest in Twilight, I am extremely disappointed that James didn't even bother to make an effort to develop an original arc to her story which could have been done well had she taken it in a different direction. Yet her books are international best sellers. I am annoyed above all because I contributed to that success.<br /><br />Clearly James wanted to create an adult version of the Twilight series but she even failed at that; her characters are completely immature, under-developed (especially Christian and Elena) and lacking in depth, and the dialogue is extremely childish, especially in books two and three. The progression of the plot was so weak, I felt like I was reading a book by a 12 year old.<br /><br />I am not averse to happy endings - in fact I like them but I was hoping for a darker storyline - at least as it progressed. I would have liked James to take her time with the development of Christian and Ana's love affair, perhaps expound on Christian's relationships with his ex-subs and Elena in particular. But I suppose I would only enjoy it if it was written well and the evidence suggests that had she done that, all the reader would get is more \\"holy crap\\", \\"stop biting that lip\\", and \\"my inner goddess.\\" I also think her writing the book in the first person and in Ana's perspective compromised her ability to write other characters well. James is clearly incapable of handling that writing style.<br /><br />I was also done with all the redundant sex scenes and the funny thing is, they aren't even that kinky or erotic. Ana climaxes at the mere sound of her name, Christian gasps at the most innocent displays of affection, and the whole \\"i dont want to be spanked, oh wait, i kind of like it now\\" was just pathetic. I truly think if James wanted to include so many sexual interludes, she could have used them differently - perhaps even work them into the story in meaningful ways but that requires talent which she has little of as far as I'm concerned.<br /><br />I should have stopped reading the books at this point but unfortunately, I get really annoyed if I dont finish books I start.gests that had she done that, all the reader would get is more \\"holy crap\\", \\"stop biting that lip\\", and \\"my inner goddess.\\" I also think her writing the book in the first person and in Ana's perspective compromised her ability to write other characters well.

B0063GORYU|5.0|I love it! I only do one suit, but that's enough for me right now. I can't do this often enough. Very challenging.
B006MW3VGA|5.0|As a Prime member, I watched Season 1 for free after hearing good reviews of it.  It was well-cast, well-acted, with beautifully detailed costuming and a compelling story line.  So compelling, I purchased the second season for $14.99, and was not disappointed.  The drama and intrigue continued, as well as excellent character development.  Titled or servant, the author is able to show us that everyone has lapse of judgement, inner struggle and even the ability to change.  The villains softer sides are exposed, and the mercurial emotions of the three daughters seem to evolve and mature over time so that their better traits of forgiveness, selflessness and charity are shown.  I was very pleased with my purchase, and look forward with great anticipation, for Season 3.
B00457WZEI|4.0|Upon first opening this novel, I was brought back in time to the first horse book I ever read, \\"Black Beauty\\". Where the tale was told from view of a red bay, 4 white socks, and a black tail and mane, named Joey. I love books that go in a different direction and was so glad to see that it took this track. \\"War Horse\\" is delightful in its simplicity. Joey brings us into his world, seen from his perspective, with horses eyes. I did feel that Morpurgo could have gotten more descriptive and go a little deeper in the adventures and horrors that Joey experienced. It is here that it lacked for me. I know that I reacted deeply to what happened to Beauty, in \\"Black Beauty\\" and just didn't quite feel that same connection as I did to Joey's story. Perhaps that is just because I am not a 9 year old little girl but a grandmother over 55.<br />The horrors of war were touched but if felt like the writer, Morpurgo, was afraid of offending the child reading this story. War happens and it is not pretty, and the ugliness of it was just to light,it didn't make a strong impression. Again I know that this book was written for children, but it lacked for me.<br />All in all, I was very glad that I read this book and I will share this book with my grandchildren. \\"War Horse\\" by Michael Morpurgo is a wonderful adventure based on a true event.<br /><br />**Edited to state that I read this book through my local library on my Kindle
B0086700CM|5.0|At first when I found out that it was not avalibe for my kindle fire  I was really upset, but now since it came out it like the only game /app I play!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book.  I have read the trilogy and loved all of them.  Amazon makes it so easy for me to order books to read on my Kindle.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have had no issuses with it on kindle fire. It downloaded fine and hasn't crashed. Two things to note: 1) the fire is heavy and big so its harder to hold than a phone or ipod touch. 2) after a while of continuted use it will hurt your wrist. As far as game play goes the game is fun and addictive.
B003YUOH3Y|4.0|Long time Converse wearer and looking for more support with same cool style. Found it with these shoes. As others have said, sizing is an issue. I wear a women's 7, but ordered a women's 8 based on the reviews. They were snug at the front as others have said but I put them on with extra thick running socks to break them in and now they are super comfortable.  Maybe not for those with wide feet because they are a bit snug. Without socks feels like walking barefoot.  Just ordered a second pair in navy.  Thanks for making stylish shoes that are easy to wear!
B0086700CM|2.0|I have an impression tablet, and it downloaded but would not open. I  love the game but it wouldn't work for me :(
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game so much I got to two million.I beat every one I played.my mom could not beat me.

B004A8ZWWO|1.0|The movie was laced with too much profanity. I would not reccomend this movie to anyone who would not want filth to float through their mind
B0086700CM|5.0|you will love it and have countless hour of fun. it will be one of those games you won't. put down
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is super fun and addicting!  once you start playing, it's. really hard to stop!  it is a fun way to spend your extra time!
B0016OLC5Q|4.0|As a hippy teenager, I thought and lived much like Christopher McCandless.  Fortunately, by God's grace, I grew-up before I met a tragic end as McCandless did.<br /><br />Only the spoiled son of a wealthy man could live as he did.  He engaged in foolishness and took foolish risks because he knew he could go back to his parents for help, and especially if things turned-out badly.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the movie, and McCandless is a likeable character.  Though, I cringed through much of the movie, at McCandless's foolishness idealism, and the memories it brought back of my own.
0061689246|3.0|It has all the elements of a good book, I guess. But it's only average. Why does everybody like Neil Gaiman so much?
B00006RAKP|5.0|Wonderful memories as the songs play. I got an extra cd titled ---Elton John's Greatest Hits Volume lll 1979-1987.  The cd was hidden under the right flap. The outside cd case does not indicate an extra cd. Lucky me!!!
0553801473|1.0|I hate you, George RR Martin. You are an evil, sadistic little man, aren't you?<br /><br />First I had to go through Feast for Crows without my favorite characters. I actually thought they were going to be right around the corner up until the last page when - surprise! I find out they were moved to the next book. Okay. \\"No problem,\\" I said. \\"I'll wait, Georgey Porgey. But it better be good.\\"<br /><br />But it wasn't. Oh, how it wasn't. (He made this girl cry.)<br /><br />There seems to be a huge misconception that this is actually reading material, judging by how the average rating isn't 1 star.<br /><br />How does someone start a series so magnificently and then deteriorate so magnificently quickly?<br /><br />The problem here is that NOT ENOUGH HAPPENS. Phrases are repeated until you want to smash your book or reading device with a hammer. Tyrion keeps \\"taking a piss.\\"<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT? DOES IT MATTER? Tyrion spends the entire book just /traveling/ to where Daenerys is. At first you think, cool! Daenerys gets to meet Tyrion! But then you just forget that that was ever his destination. And Cersei? I think she got her comeuppance in this book, but really all I remember is where do whores go? You know nothing, Jon Snow. I'mma take a piss off the boat now.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|This is an excellent dvd.  It is 2-disc and was well worth the price.  It is the complete season 1 of the show.  I love this series and hope to purchase Season 2 soon.
0345803485|5.0|My husband bought this for me for Mother's Day.  Needless to say, he thinks it was an excellent investment.  The only problem with this book is that it ends.  I wish it had been a 1000 pages.  Do yourself a favor, before you finish the first book, order the second one.  I had never read a book like this before and it's better than any other therapy I can think of! I just hope this author keeps on writing,otherwise there will be a couple of million sad women moping around.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|great side scrolling defense game. the upgrades are Interesting. the mini pachenko game is cute. you get attacked by flying zombie squirrels. what's not to love?
0345803507|5.0|I heard a lot about 50 Shades of Grey from the media and my co-workers. I had to read about all the fuss. I read the first book and I couldn't get enough. I was happy to see there was two more books. I read all three books in 2weeks. I could not put the books down. Yes I agree the author did repeat herself and I did notice some grammar errors. However It did not make a huge influence. I fell in love with books and Ana and Christian. By the last book It was filled with, love, horror, actions, passion, and growth with Ana and Christian. I cried, laughed out loud, and sat on the edge of my seat. I was sad when the story ended and not reading about Ana and christian. I Want more!!!!! I will refer this story to my friends to read. 50 Shades of Grey is a page turner with lots of kinkyness. If you not into hot and heavy passion, kinky stuff do not read, but if your open minded and willing to indulge in a great story that is right up your alley.
B0086700CM|5.0|me and my friends have been waiting for this game to come out on the Kindle! Omg, I was Soooo happy when I saw it ( :<br /><br />#ThankYou^____^
B007MNV5WU|5.0|This app is awesome but there is a minor setback. This one goes out to Rovio and Amazon. I am very disappointed that us people on the kindle cannot get the world &quot;Danger Zone.&quot; We also cannot get the free version of this game and the ad-free version. So if people from Amazon or Rovio read this, include Danger Zone in the next update after the donut world. Or at least give us the ad-free and free version. both companies will get more money therefore more sales therefore... bigger salary. So who's in? I would like comments for this review as well. Find me on Playstation as steveisfun56! (No exclamation point in my user name.)
B0086700CM|5.0|i cant believe they finally got this on the store! im so happy tht i can now play thiz kn my fire. the games works great amd dossnt alow dkwn any of my ohrr apps or my kindle fire in general. best game ever! a must get!

B0086700CM|5.0|this is a great game u would be satisfied with it but sumtimes it does stuff you did not put there lik if you went right it would run u into sumthin
B0086700CM|3.0|i love this game on the ipod or iphone.. but on the kindle fire it glitches alot tends to mess up my score alot so i just get frustrated but end up playin it sgain because its addicting
B0086700CM|5.0|This game has been out on every device other than this one now it is finally out! It rocks. GET It.
B007V2UGPE|3.0|Love this game. It is so much fun and definatley addicting. Unfortunately it will freeze after a while and you have to uninstall and reinstall. The only other problem ive found is that whenever you die you can purchase a revive with gold coins that you can pay for with real money or can find throught the game. One revive costs five coins supposedly but if you have six coins the game will take all six coins. Again I loved this game but became frustrated with the glitches.
B0086700CM|5.0|Finally got one right... Temple Run is going to keep you running for hours.. Plenty of unlockables without spending a penny.. just keep runnin and runnin.. runnin and runnin... black eyed peas style.. you know the song so now know the game..........
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is the best and you will enjoy the game. what you do on this game is work on getting new characters and coins. you work on getting farther on your running. there is about 4 girl characters and 4 boy characters and they have all kinds of settings and stuff.
B0086700CM|4.0|I love temple run.  The game is addicting, I play it on my opossum all the time but one thing about the kindle fire virsion is that if you tilt it just a little the character goes to the side of the path.  Which makes it hard for me on the stone raised paths.
B0086700CM|5.0|Thank you! I've been waiting for this app to come out tor a while! This game is so fun and I play it a lot! To any one who hasn't. downloaded. this awesome game yet do it! Do it now!
B0086700CM|1.0|Play this game on my ipod, but doesn't work on the lg optimus slider. Error message \\"The application has stopped unexpectedly. Please try again.\\" My only option is to force close. All other apps I've downloaded work on my phone.
B007KDFWRG|4.0|I saw this band last year in Auckland New Zealand without the horn section. They didn't miss them at all though Genius performance from Derek, and Susan sung with incredible soul, winning me over as I didn't think she had the capability from what I'd heard and seen prior. In fact I thought the Tedeschi Trucks project was a backward step from where DTB left off but after that concert I was a convert.  However I am slightly disappointed with this CD compared with live DTB dvd and CD's.  Despite great playing by everyone, (and I so miss Mike's lead vocals he is a superb singer - how can you put that guy as backing?) there's just too much on the instrumental side that is jammy and somewhat repetitive. As an example too much wah wah, and too many blurry fast (though highly competent)bass lines. Less would have been more. It works magic if you are at the concert (or remember these songs from  a concert) but I don't think a lot of these translate onto a live CD well. Still I admire their conviction, song choice and direction which is against the tide of the ordinary and for that it deserves 4 stars and is still a fine CD to have in your collection.
B0086700CM|4.0|Even though the objective is always the same,  the game is fast pace and fun. I keep finding myself trying to beat my last score and go further and faster then my previous run! Watch out for the obstacles! enjoy!
0525478817|5.0|John Green has managed to, once again, get me to read a book. I'm not big on reading and when I do read its either a gruesome process that I'm forced to go through (thanks school) or i sit there and am captured in a whole different world and cannot put the book down. All of John's books have done the later for me. I can never put his books down until I'm finished, and TFIOS is no exception. DFTBA!
B005TBN04S|5.0|People can be extremely hard on the good movies with all the crap out there. I thought the sequel was hilarious and had its own die laughing moments. It is not the first one and yes the first one is better but no that does not mean this one wasn't great.

B0086700CM|5.0|i have been regularly cheching the market for this app since i purchased my kindle fire, and finally it has come. this game has great graphics, fast and nonstop gameplay, and although in app purchases are available, they  are not  neccisary. i am in fact in wonder that this app is free. it deserves at least a 99&cent; price... but hey, i'm not complaining!!!

B007J4T2G8|4.0|Tis book is not as bad as I thought it would be. I read all the reviews and I was worried it would be awful like many people said but I really enjoyed the read. It was a fast read and is something I've never read before. Granted yes I will agree E.L. James used th same phrases and words over and over again but give her a break it's her first novel and also you can't really phrase some of the things she said any other way...  I am itching to see how this translates onto the big screen and pray they do not age it down and make it a pg-13 movie to accommodate more viewers because this book isn't a pg-13 book. I also hope they get the actors I see as the characters which are the characters from twilight honestly because they are the only ones I see as the characters.<br /><br />But in conclusion give this book a chance you might really enjoy it
B0001XAPZ6|1.0|This version of Nausicaa is extremely disappointing compared to the version released in the 80's.. The speech made no sense in this & at times didn't match to the mouths.. I hope I still have the one that was recorded from the TV still around somewhere.. Might sell this version if I can find the older version..
B0086700CM|5.0|I love it! ! when I am bored it is the best thing that has ever happens to me &lt;333
1597801585|1.0|If this is award winning sci-fi then please leave me to my non-fiction books.  I don't read much sci-fi and now I remember why.  While the idea is original the author fails to put it into text.  I mean, he has a great idea and brings to life a host of cool characters (who seem to be on a colision course) but never developes much of a story.  Instead he takes the easy path and goes for total annihilation which, considering how much energy he wastes on trivial issues in the first hundred and fifty pages, is not a bad thing.  It just seems like he got tired of his own idea.  Too bad, a lot of editing and a little more trial and error and this could have been a good book.  Instead it's like a flesh wound full of maggots, interesting in a nauseating sort of way.
B007P6VM04|5.0|I absolutely love this CD!!!  I purchased this CD the first week of its release and have listened to it nonstop since.  I will probably buy the \\"Target\\" version as well, since I didn't find out about the additional tracks until AFTER I purchased it.  I do think that more songs should have been included from the show, but hopefully, they'll release another volume.  I absolutely love \\"Let Me Be Your Star\\" by Megan Hilty and Katharine McPhee, as well as \\"History is Made at Night\\".  The only track I really don't care for on the whole cd is the one be Nick Jonas.  I'm not sure why they selected this track over other possible tracks from the show.  So, to sum it up, great show....great cd!!!
B0086700CM|1.0|I was able to install this game in my evo 3d but it will not open at all.  It just show an opening screen for less than a second then quits.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Hunger Games.  As soon as I finished it I immediately bought the next two books in the trilogy.  I am almost done with the 3rd book.  This was a great trilogy.  I have not seen the movie yet, but I will.

0375869026|5.0|Wonder by R.J. Palacio follows August Pullman through the 5th grade at Beecher Prep Middle School in Manhattan. August has a genetic disorder that has required multiple facial surgeries, and his face will never look normal. He's been homeschooled through 4th grade, so his first day of 5th grade is really his first day out in the world on his own. Middle school is tough for most kids, but truly terrifying for August, who encounters both bullying and kindness.  The story is divided into eight parts with Parts 1, 6, and 8 narrated by August, Part 2 narrated by  August's sister Via ( a freshman in high school), Part 3 narrated by August's friend Summer, Part 4 narrated by August's friend Jack, Part 5 narrated by Via's boyfriend Justin, and Part 7 narrated by Via's friend Miranda.<br /><br />Telling the story from six different points of view, three male and three female, three younger (5th grade) and three older (9th grade) make this an engaging story for boys and girls alike. I thought the ending could have been stronger, but overall excellent writing and a powerful message earn this book five stars. Every middle school kid would benefit from reading this book.  The absence of profanity and adult situations makes it appropriate for advanced 3rd and 4th grade readers as well.
B00005JL96|5.0|This movie didn't get that much hype but it is one of my favorites.  The dvd was in good shape for being a kids movie and used.

B006XF5BTG|5.0|I accidently found this book while searching through various other books.  This one seemed to have a different take on working out, a bit like, ''you've tried the rest, now try the best''.  I read a couple of reviews, and was impressed with what they had said about the book.  So I thought its worth a go and it was a decent price.  On reading the book Ive been very impressed with the detail, but not too complicated, and it just seemed to make sense.  It was a bit like I already knew what Michael was telling me, but this just confirmed it.  Im just starting the routines, and I hope that I get half of the results that Michael got, as he is properly cut.  Its a very worthwhile read and I am already reading it for a second time.  This could be the start of the new you.<br /><br />While Im here I would definately recommend his book 'Muscle Myths'.  Another great read, and I can guarantee that you will have heard the myths that he dispells in this book.<br /><br />[[ASIN:147514377X Muscle Myths: 50 Health & Fitness Mistakes You Didn't Know You Were Making]]<br /><br />Ben Davy (UK)
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|This app is much faster than the dictionary included with the Kindle Fire.  Therefore it is much more practical.  Occasionally I come across a technical term that is not in this dictionary.  But it is a frequently used app on my Kindle when I write papers  for grad school.
B0086700CM|3.0|after you play it for a while it gets old and then you want to go to a different game. don't waist your time. fun at first but then gets old
B0063IH60K|5.0|It's just like Solitaire that I remember from playing on the computer.  Ads don't bother me, and for a free app, you get great quality along with endless hours of fun.  Very enjoyable.
B004XUMPFQ|5.0|Great show. If you love Joss Whedon stuff you'll love this. Loved it when it was on tv and still love it now. God I hope Netflix pulls an Arrested Development on this and get's it going somehow. Been a lot of years though. I always forget Christina Hendricks is in this for a couple episodes.
0345803485|4.0|I really like the story in the book although it reminds so much of the twilight series.  The only problem that I really had is the words and expressions that the writer chose to use.  You can tell that she is not from America.  I don't know any 21 year old college student that speaks the way the main character does and some of the repetative expressions are not common in America.  Also, there are alot of repetitive statements refering to the girls subconsioius and she says crap a lot in the book.  I don't know but it started to kind of turn me off as I got about half way through the second book.  All in all it's a good story. Kept me entertained for awhile any way.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game rocks on my kindle. Whenever I have some time to blow; this is the first game I tap on!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|Awesome game!  Great entertainment!  Plays great on my kindle fire.  Graphics are cool. Really enjoying this app.  Get it while it's free!
B0086700CM|5.0|After all the waiting and fake temple run apps, they finally have the real game! Thank goodness. This is a very fun and entertaining game. You will not be sorry that you bought it!
B007EC27QM|5.0|I needed a calculator app and foind thos one.  It is the best app yet.  big buttons easy use.  Excellent.
B003Y74KCK|5.0|I purchased this case a few weeks back. I wanted to try it out before writing the review.<br /><br />This case is pretty amazing. I'm not sure why other people received cases that did not fit well. Mine were perfect. This case is thin and protective. The case has a easy design grip. It does not create extra unwanted bulk.<br /><br />This case was $7 (when I purchased it). Don't expect a  high-quality case that will protect your phone from hail, sleet, or rain. If you are careful with your phone, this case is for you. If you plan on throwing your phone around, then I suggest the titanium one that case-mate.com sells for $300. Your pick.
B0086700CM|4.0|it keeps me hooked and i can never get off. i enjoy playing this when im bored and its pretty fun
B0086700CM|5.0|this is a great game for kindle fire. I play it every day its awesome. whoever invented it is a genius
B0086700CM|5.0|ive been trying to look for temple run on my kindle for a while and then it just pops up I was so happy. its bigger on my kindle but bigger better!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome game its free has fun games and lots of them.  ive played it on the ds now the kindle awesome.
B0086700CM|4.0|The awesome game is here! The only reason I took off a star is because it took SOO SOO LONG!
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is a fast paced, addictive and super fun game and it sure took long enough to put it on the app store! this is totally worthwhile and an awesome game to have!  now all they hag to do is put tiny wings and jetpack joyride on the appetite and I'll be overjoyed
B0086700CM|5.0|finally ive been waiting for this game like forever but its hard to tilt the kindle but I don't care who went to dorney park because I'm taking g steel force stir ger Andre possessed
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting forever for this to make it to the android markets and stuff. It is really fun for me
B0063IH60K|5.0|this is an addictive and fascinating game. I have found myself totally engrossed and oblivious to everything around me. I would totally. recommend. wholeheartedly and with much enthusiasm.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I get the feeling that the \\"talked about\\" content in this book had a real editor. The quality and effectiveness of the writing in that section was different from the terrible beginning and awful ending. Those parts were dreadful. How many teenager-like Wows and Oh my lines can you read before you ask yourself, \\"why on earth am I reading this?\\"<br /><br />The story was ground to an ever-so-slow pace. I think it was done to make this a three book series (with only one story to tell). This trilogy book business is damaging the art for the sake of the dollar. Wow, just like the movie business.... I digress.<br /><br />I can tell this story in four lines and save you $10:<br /><br />Virginal dumb girl falls for rich man with fetishes and baggage.<br />Girl thinks man will change.<br /><br />Men don't change.<br />Girl is sad.
9056912445|4.0|Excellent book... I own Dvoretsky too - it is a classic of course but sometimes the learning curve is too steep. For example Dvoretsky opens the chapter on bishop vs knight with a study that de la Villa uses as a last and most complex example on this topic.<br />I had to remove one star for poor editing - it's a shame that diagrams are published without indication of side to move. I usually like to analyze the position myself before reading the text and with this book you have to look into game notation to know side to move. So on first reading I had to write W or B next to each diagram.
B005K17RU0|5.0|So far this weather app has been the best at keeping me up to date on my Kindle Fire. I love it and it is so accurate and easy to use.
B0086700CM|5.0|love the challenges.  keeps u coming back. playing during down times to keep brain stimulated. love it. some challenges more difficult than others.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is the most fun addicting game I love it it is so fun on the kindle fire and on the I pad awesome
B0083VFEMW|4.0|The Scissor Sisters have always made my feet happy and their newest album is no exception to the rule. Though their debut album and Ta-Dah remain my favorites, Magic Hour is very quickly growing on me, with \\"Keep Your Shoes\\" every bit as infectious and dangerously danceable as \\"Take Your Mama,\\" \\"Music is The Victim\\" and \\"Filthy Gorgeous\\" off their first album.<br /><br />Always paying their respects to those who came before them (mainly Elton John, George Michael, Queen and Abba) Scissor Sisters never fail to inject freshness into every one of their tracks. You can't help but smile at \\"Keep Your Shoes\\" (I know I already said how good it is, but it is REALLY, REALLY good!) and \\"Let's Have A Kiki\\" (oh, boy, that song sure is fun, like Miami Sound Machine for the 21st century, on speed, tongue in cheek!)<br /><br />Another winner, \\"Baby Come Home,\\" reminds me the most of the magic from their unforgettable debut. I can't complain about a single song on here (it's Scissor Sisters, after all) but the ones that stand out for me the most are the ones my feet can't say no to...not just the ones already mentioned, but also \\"Best In Me\\" and \\"Somewhere.\\"
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun to play but it takes forever to get points.  some of the games are a little simple but I like the ease of play.
B007LB1O3I|2.0|This is probably my least favorite of all Madonna's albums next to \\"Hard Candy\\". It is contrived and repetitive with nothing to really catch the attention of the listener. I'm a little disappointed, however I realize this is her new genre.
B0086700CM|5.0|totally addictive game.  some times swipes don't register but game is cool, worth a buck or faotd. kindle fire and Motorola defy.
B007SGM084|5.0|This is a book that you cannot put down.  The author is very detailed in her writing, so be prepared.  It is a story about how far two people will go to be together.  In essence, it is a modern day love story.  The characters are amazingly complex and make you want more.  I love that the ending wrapped everything together nicely and doesn't leave you hanging...although...I'd love to see how Christian and Ana are doing now. :)
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have this on Kindle Fire and it runs great. It has never mest up on me and ive had it since the Kindle first came out.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was well written, erotic, provocative, and quite honestly the beginning of a wonderful love story. I loved it!
031618201X|5.0|I saw this book in my local bookstore and since I have a love for the Victorian era, I picked it up. The art is spectacular, but no suprise given the artist. I instantly fell in love with the story and have been devouring the novels as soon as I finished this. There are so many things I feel right now about this book that I can't articulate. I love all the effort that has been poured into this, but it definatley isn't something for children, since it may be a bit graphic in places (It's a comic, it has pictures FYI), but it is spectacular and I highly recommend it.
B0086700CM|5.0|i love this game.  but dont listen to the reviews tht say its a bad game. it works on my kindle fire  GREAT.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|It is almost new and had no issues with it. Packing is also original. No complaints. Received it in less than two week of purchase.
B00006690G|5.0|When Eminem was first introduced to the public we got this wild kid who could care less about other people's opinions. Sure \\"The Slim Shady LP\\" had a few deep/dark songs (mostly dark humor), but majority of it was pure comedy. Things so random that you had to laugh. Combine a good sense of humor and a knack for storytelling and you have yourself a good MC. One year after dropping SSLP Marshall is back with his second album \\"The Marshall Mathers LP.\\" This album is by far his darkest, which is why I feel many look at it as his best. Once again, another great album. Two years later he's back again with his third album \\"The Eminem Show.\\"<br /><br />There are many reasons why I feel this was his best album, and his last great album. With his debut we got to see Slim Shady, with his sophomore album we got to see Marshall Mathers, now we get to see Eminem. Three albums in (four if you count Infinite) and we are just now seeing just who Eminem is. He's more than a guy who cracks jokes, more than a guy with a dark sense of humor, more than a guy that has issues with his mom and his ex, he's a human just like you and I. Never in my life have I heard an album that was this consistent all the way through. The production, his verses, the guest artists, the skits, they all work together perfectly to form one amazing record.<br /><br />He touches on a wide variety of topics on this album, including the government, his beefs at the time, his mom, his ex, his daughter, he holds nothing back. It's a full on attack of everything he's held in and/or witnessed in the past two years since MMLP. Then you have songs like \\"Drips\\" that are there to paint you a picture. The way him and Obie put that song together is phenomenal. It's so clever and witty, it's so vivid, and it all comes together to make a coherent story. It's amazing that it's only been a decade since this album dropped, but no one does stuff like this anymore.<br /><br />In many ways I think he uses his humor at times to try and distract him from his problems. On track eight \\"Say Goodbye To Hollywood\\" he goes: \\"Bury my face in comic books, cause I don't want to look, at nothin' this world's too much, I've swallowed all I could. If I could swallow a bottle of tylenol I would, and end it for good, just say goodbye to Hollywood.\\" No matter who you are, that's some really dark stuff. If I remember correctly he wrote this album while on the set of 8 Mile, which is when he started getting addicted to the sleep medication that would eventually put him on a five year hiatus after 2004's \\"Encore.\\"<br /><br />Standout Songs: \\"Square Dance\\" \\"Say Goodbye To Hollywood\\" & \\"Say What You Say (Feat. Dr. Dre)\\"<br /><br />- I advise you to check out the entire album though.<br /><br />Overall Score: 10/10 - I don't give out perfect scores often. However, this album is a decade old and it still holds that \\"wow\\" factor from when I first heard it. It still has the same intensity and to be honest, it just never gets old. In many ways I felt he perfected his craft on this album by combining everything he had done on his first two albums. If you only listen to one Eminem record in your life, let it be this one.
B007JQLNXG|5.0|As a die-hard Peter Gabriel fan, I was most eager to listen to this album, and overall, was not disappointed.  His use of a full orchestra and their intricate arrangements added depth and feeling to Gabriel's already soul-full music, with a combination of the classics, and even some that I did not recognize.
B000RO9PXC|5.0|of all the LIVE albums by the doors, this one is my favorite....great songs, Jim sounds awesome, Fun to listen to!!!!! doors fans, you MUST have this one....
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting for this app to come out forever!!! I love temple run and my ipod broke so I couldn't play it!!!! YAY!
B0011U8NZ2|5.0|This CD is worth the price of admission for the \\"mystery train, away in india, crossroads\\"....one of the best versions ever....Jim at his best, great recording, audio is great....Doors fans, you must have this one!!!! RIP Jim!!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is absolutely amazing. I've never been a huge fan of games that you cannot win, but you can compete for high scores. Temple Run, however, was so amazing that I forgot all about that. The controls are easy, so it takes about a minute to learn. After that, you have hours of fun waiting. Jumping, dodging, sliding, getting coins to buy amazing power-ups...all on a beautiful temple map. The only thing I have a problem with is the Demon Monkeys (they are laughably demented to the point where you spend about an hour arguing with your friend about what animal they are supposed to resemble) and repetitiveness of the map. The game play is so awesome that I can look past this, but I think the developers should update the map a bit. All in all, probably the best free running app ever invented. Thank you developers!
B0086700CM|5.0|I LOVE this game its so addicting but in a good way it's a little slow on my kindle but other than that it's amazing
B0086700CM|5.0|Well I'm berry happy they did finally came out for the kindle and I play it on my iphone too! but it is pretty fun though. so if you think you think its boring you got another tho g coming!
B0044RUSZM|5.0|Iv had this stand for over a year, its great for my 15' MBP. Great price for something that lets your computer be off the desk.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is hard then when you get upgrades then it becomes easy then you get fitter in to the game.
B0086700CM|5.0|seeeeexxxxyyyyy and a beast game I love it its addicting and should cos more money they would get hell of a lot
B0086700CM|5.0|that's awesome its finally on the kindle. it was just on I oho.es or ipads or I pods ht know its on the kinddle doing the same thing
B0086700CM|5.0|so cool and it is so addicting I will play this game all day long BEST GAME EVER love it
B0086700CM|5.0|I luff it :D DEFINATELY GET THIS GAME GUYS!<br />its entertainertaining,challenging and addicting all at the same time. I cant stop trying to beat my high score
B007IXWKUK|1.0|After reading the first book, I thought book two might be a better written book.  After only a few chapters, I put the book down.  The characters are weak and the story line is something anyone could write.  It is totally fantasy.
B007BWUJ60|5.0|This reedition have a superior quality of sound. The remastered apurede the sound. This is a great álbum and deserve this job. I liked a lot.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I bought this book because of all of the publicity it was receiving.  After reading it, I felt that it lived up to the publicity.  However, the majority of people are right.  It is just a poorly written sex manual.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this hut a lot of people don't because they don't know that to get off of it. All you have to do is go to options
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This was not what I thought it was, but it is a brest game!!!! works great on the kindle fire.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I downloaded it when going on a business trip - I needed a game that wouldn't require wifi.  Now I am kind of hooked!  I am an old SimCity fan - this game *sort of* resembles that one.  I hope it continues to be good!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was the perfect completion to the Hunger Games trilogy. I seriously read this book within 24 hours. I can't really say more about it. If you read the Hunger Games, then you will naturally find your way to this book. And if you don't read it, you won't ever get the end of the series.<br />Definitely a well-crafted book, standing as the final chapter to Katniss's journey.
B000057H8P|1.0|I ordered this DVD and when I tried to play it the DVD player said region error and would not play the movie.
B0017KIBAI|5.0|New Nintendo brand Gamecube controller, colored to match the Wii. The cable is twice as long as standard controllers at 10'. Crispy!
B007SGM084|5.0|I saw an interview with the author and it perked my interest.  Once I started reading I couldn't get enough!  It is a rare author who's character development skills are capable of intoxicating the reader with such a potent mix of emotion and guilty pleasure.  To be able to convince a world of readers to branch out of their sexual comfort zone and indulge in a romance based upon a controversial erotic lifestyle is amazing.  To have those readers insisting everyone they know MUST read the series too...genius.  Treat yourself to an exhilarating roller coaster ride of emotion that you never want to end and purchase this series NOW.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Not your usual crime novel.  More of a psychological mystery, with a good dose of psychology tossed in.  Well written, a pleasure to read.  One of those perfect books that you can finish in a weekend.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I'm really glad this is available on my kindle. it's one of my favorites from zynga online but I like playing it this way better.
1451627289|5.0|This was my first foray into the world of Stephen King. I am not a fan of horror stories but am always drawn to all things Kennedy. Thus, I was pulled in by the title. The book is not specifically about JFK or even the assassination, but about traveling into the past with the intent to change history. Turns out, not only is the past obdurate, but every change causes a butterfly (ripple) effect.<br />The book is very cleverly written, but the reader must concentrate on every detail so as not to miss the little intricacies that tie everything together.<br />There are some parts that are a bit drawn out, but overall, it is a definite \\"must read\\". Loved it!
B007PTJOV0|4.0|I enjoy playing the game. its a lot of fun. great to pass time. I recommend it and I'm sure if you like those old nintendo games,  you'll enjoy this one too.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed every part of every book in the trilogy. I did not let the repetitive words get under my skin to the point that I could not enjoy the book.<br /><br />If you read about the author, she mentions in an interview that the story came to her regarding slightly of her past. I find that even more intriguing about the books after I have read them.<br /><br />The trilogy is amazing! That is all... for now.<br /><br />x
B008578H9G|5.0|Loved the show for all 8 seasons. Very few shows do i set my DVR for and must wacth it, House was one. sad to see it end, it could have easily went on another season or 2.<br />  The Finale, I wish it was a 2 hour event, it deserved it!  But atleast they did show that retrospective special right before it.<br />  I really kinda wanted House to really be dead as we thought he was for a few seconds. I thought, who but HOUSE would have the balls to kill off the main character and END the series! Seems every ending to a series these days, they ALWAYS leave a door open for a comeback special or something.<br />Oh well. Wilson will be dead if they do, unless they drove their bikes down to Mexico and got some unorthodox remedy there. Who knows with TV....
B007IXWKUK|5.0|..as the first! As I have mentioned in my review for book one, this trilogy has an amazing story. I could not put it down!<br /><br />x
B008577DT6|5.0|Loved the show for all 8 seasons. Very few shows do i set my DVR for and must wacth it, House was one. sad to see it end, it could have easily went on another season or 2.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read and read a LOT of reviews before deciding to purchase this book. I found a lot of reviews to be rather harsh and quite frankly, rude. I loved this book, all of them in fact. It is not JUST erotica or porn, it has a story. A story I believe that other women can and will relate to, as I did.<br /><br />This trilogy is obviously not for everyone, so if it was not, please do not purposely write hateful reviews.<br /><br />Overall, I give the trilogy 5 stars. And according to the last page in book three, I hope that was all... for now.<br /><br />x
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its a great challenge. if you need something to pass time this is it. it really tests you're brain cells.
B0086700CM|1.0|I really dislike this game. it isn't very well written code wise and I, being a computer expert,  find all aspects of the game from a creation qaulity stand point, extremely poor.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|Nice addition to the genre. Hours of fun. Not terribly hard, but not too easy, either. Worth a dollar to play.
B0086700CM|5.0|Oh my God! I'm sooooooo happy you guys got this I was one of the people that recommended this game and they actually did it! Haha! I'm really really excited to finally have it on my kindle fire. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!!!!!!!
B006P0FD4W|3.0|This time we go back to the late 80s to witness the origin of the demon possession that plagues the ill-fated sisters of this series.<br /><br />This installment has some good scenes and a genuinely creepy ending, but it also comes off as more than a little silly at times when characters in mortal danger and stark terror are apparently taking great care to make sure that the camera is running.  The found footage genre can be very effective when done well, but I think the inherent eeriness of bumps in the night and vulnerable people sleeping in darkened bedrooms has just about been exhausted at this point.  It's time to move on.
0345803485|2.0|We bought this book for my mom, and so far she says it is an ok book. But, the PAGES ARE FALLING OUT. She got it for mother's day, which was not that long ago, and we are very disappointed in the quality of the product.
145162445X|5.0|I read this a couple of months ago and am still thinking of several of the concepts. Krauss does an excellent job in carefully explaining difficult concepts, and fairly represents the various (thin) arguments against his science based ideas.
B0086700CM|1.0|takes forvever to download, takes forever to load and when it does it is super slow. everyone is like &quot; no prob on kindle fire! so awesome! blab blab!&quot; but this game barely works and came out llike two months after it went out of style. gotta love amazon.  I wonder how much an ipad costs.....
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game. I would totally recommend this game. This game is challenging and very fun. You have to play this game.
B0086700CM|5.0|Love it! I couldn't wait till they made it for kindle fire and they finally did! I love love love love it!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Excellent novel with many unexpected twists.  A great and quick read.  Couldn't put it down until I finished the entire trilogy.  Looking forward to other works from this author.
B0086700CM|5.0|people who don't like this r crazy if u have not got this buy it is so fun buy it it is fun! !!!!!!!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I have this gamee on my ipod and I love it!  I'm so haply they have it ffor kindle fire and android!! Happy :)
B007V2UGPE|4.0|so it is pretty good game alot like the garfield and evil dead defense games I like the mini games and how you can be very specific about how you upgrade
B007TKBE40|5.0|Great vocals with an \\"Old Timey\\" feel. It is great to see someone still paying music with a purpose and capturing the \\"Mojo\\" of the Music Gods. I can't wait for the next one he burns off.
B0086700CM|5.0|I've always heard great things about temple run but never got to play because I don't have iPod touch, iPhone, etc. so I was super excited when it came out for Kindle Fire.
B007T2XC7A|2.0|I like Norah Jones but this album is not jamming.  It's not like she ever was jamming but I just believe she needs to up the tempo more consistently. It's starting to sound like she is making the same album for 10 years. No, I'm not talking go pop or techno just add a little spice....a little funk some variation in the arrangements.  I thought she was moving in that direction when I heard the single HAPPY PILLS but she didn't keep that sound and tempo throughout.  She needs to get with The Roots, Raphael Saadiq, or somebody similar to get it going (like Joss Stone).  I hate to say it but I fell asleep twice on this album.  The first song, Good Morning, should have been called Good Night because I wanted to go to sleep.<br /><br />I'm just disappointed in the overall effort.  Danger Mouse adds a few gems but nothing outstanding in my opinion.  Norah Jones voice sounds better than ever but the material is lacking.  The few songs I like are Happy Pills, Out On The Road, I Don't Wanna Hear Another Sound, and Say Goodbye. 2 Stars.
B000001FE0|5.0|Very happy to have been able to get a CD of this album.  We originally bought it on vinyl many years ago and loved it.  Great service and delivery on time.
B0025X4OYI|3.0|I ordered  Ray Charles In Country and Western Music. The Cd looked fine on the outside everything in English, but when you download it on the computer to your media player everthing is in Chinese. I sent it back and they replaced it with one just like it. Should I try again? Has anybody had this problem?
B0086700CM|5.0|finally the greatest game on the kindle fire! glad that they put it on I play with it allll the time! u will loooove this game its so addicting! I love unlocking new things
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I wont say there aren't parts of this book that you read and think, \\"really?\\" but that doesn't change the fact that it really is a good book. Yes, there are erotic scenes in it, obviously but this book is about so much more than that. If you're like me and you really get into a book, than this book will have you laughing, rolling your eyes and crying all in the same chapter. I was only 50% of the way through the first one when I bought the other two and could not put any of them down. Take it as a challenge, read the first one and if you don't find yourself buying the next one than fine. You're out $10, it wont kill you. Everyone I talk to is reading this series and nobody stopped after book one.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|through all the hunger games book series this sure was the crapi one. Suzanne Collins should be ashamed of this horrible books!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this app it is very fun and you don't have to be good I think you should download it
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Everything works fine until you go to the radar and try to animate it. Forces close every time and is useless. Fix this problem and it would get a 5 star rating.
B0086700CM|5.0|The only thing to purchase in this app is the coins,which you can collect w/o having to buy  them. So the money prob is solved. Other than that this game is AWESOME and ADDICTING. Beware!!!!!!!!!!!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|fun game. just a cheap knockoff to super mario. its something entertaining to play when you are sitting around and bored
B005K0HDGE|5.0|A little overpriced considering what I like to pay for e-books, but worth every penny!  Great story, very well written, totally loved it!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I've enjoyed this game since I was a young boy. Very pleased with the app and the fun it provides.
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|This was fun when I first got the app.  The cat repeats what you say and you can also make the cat do a few other things.  It's a novelty and I rarely use it now.
0765348276|5.0|The first book in the Old Man's War series, it's set in a future time, and all elderly people on Earth are given the option of joining the CDF (Colonial Defense Forces) when they turn 75. If you do, you're taken off Earth and - on Earth - declared legally dead. Nobody on Earth knows exactly what happens next...except that they somehow make you young again, to fight in the war.<br /><br />I love this book and, in fact, the whole series. Scalzi's writing is energetic and always readable; the story is fast-paced and fun with believable, relateable characters; and he delights in inventing truly alien aliens for CDF to fight against.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|this is a nice game but the game keeps on freezing I think that this game has a bug plz do not get
B0086700CM|4.0|I love temple run but sometimes it would crack up and then its hard for me Upton play. other than that I like it.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|There have been a lot of words written about these two products.  I'm not going to be able to add much more other than my personal likes of the products.<br /><br />I am not a gamer.  I follow the stock market and have used this type of device to help me quickly select tools to alter  graphs and write algorithms specific to he market.  I can not imagine life without this product.  I think both of them are easily enough programmed, and both respond accurately and quickly.  I owned the Belkin product before and after it was sold, and have been using these devices for over 8 years now.<br /><br />If you use this product for stock market graphs, you will find how quickly you can assign choices in the software, and how quickly you can get through a stack of company stock graphs. Now if you want to select a horizontal line to set a stop on a graph, it's just a finger click away. Instead of having to locate the tool bar and press the wrong key, your selection is right there.  This clearly is heaven.<br /><br />I went with the Logitech this time because it had more utility. In addition to having more programmable keys, it has an LCD screen, which is programmable.  All day long this device lets me know what's going on in the world news.  It tracks your CPU and memory utilization, and let's you know you've got mail.  All very handy and critical.<br /><br />I like the availability of more programmable keys on the Logitech.  When I first got the unit, I didn't think I would fill it up, but I did.  And, it associates itself with your different programs.  I have one setup for Metastock, and another for Word/Excel.  There is no end to the utility of this product.<br /><br />Thanks to Logitech for an exceptional product and thanks to Amazon for a great price.
B006ZZANG0|4.0|Rufus Wainwright's new CD has some nice moments.  His amazing vocals are in full play on the opening title track.  \\"You're only a child with the mind of senile man, You're only a young thing about to sleep with a sea of men, Just hanging around, wearing something from God-knows-where, just having a ball,\\" Rufus sings on the track that combines his best attributes of a great arrangement, powerful vocals and intriguing lyric.  Excellent track!  My other favorite track is \\"Bitter Tears\\" which builds in tension, like a guy emotionally torn, trying to go in two different directions at the same time.  The other tracks on the set are interesting if somewhat less than totally gripping.  The DVD is interesting to hear how each song was generated and how it connects with his life experience of losing his mother and becoming a father.  There are enough good moments here to make it worth the purchase, although \\"Poses\\" and \\"Want One\\" are still his two strongest sets.  Enjoy!
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is revolutionary. I play it all the time and I don't get bored. if you need to be productive then I suggest you do not fer this game.
B006RUJST6|5.0|Wonderful book.  I hadn't read much about it before I started, so each event and twist was a new surprise.  This was a great, love-affirming read with warm, real (albeit someties annoying) characters.  It is a gem for the money.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|This is a great mind challenge game. Got for free stop hard to put a value on it but it's fun.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is awesome!!!! For anyone that enjoys old school nitendo games, this will remind them of that. I would recommend it to people of all ages.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Simple, inexpensive and effective.  Only complaint is it's a bit hard to hold onto while sharpening due to its compact size.  Recommended otherwise.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its awesome and cooool.I like it a lot and u should download this game it'd sweet.it id good for ur kids
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Loved this book.  I read it in one day and did not want it to end!  I totally jumped on the modern romance band wagon.  I have read several types of these books but most of them are terrible.  This one on the other hand, I loved.  READ READ READ!!!  You must get it!
B0086700CM|5.0|I have played this on my Kindle many, many, times and I have experienced absolutely NO problems whatsoever. My sister asks me every second to play. Sooo awesome!
B005GFPZYK|1.0|worst ever. this book MUST have been written by a committee seriously this is the most thinly veiled propaganda I've ever seen or read. avoid at all costs!
B001AQO3XS|4.0|Just a good old movie at a reasonable price.  My kids definately didn't like it as much as I did!
B007JM4CWY|4.0|I got this game free which is a very good price.  $4.99, on the other hand is a very high price.<br /><br />This is a really good game, however.  The puzzles are interesting and challenging and even though I have solved a number of them there is no sign that I am growing tired of the game.<br /><br />The user interface is a bit flawed.  The larger puzzles must be zoomed in on in order to select squares but the hints them scroll offscreen and one must continually scroll back and forth to make any progress.  The clues for the currently visible rows and columns should remain on the screen.  One nice touch on the user interface is that if you touch and hold the square rather than tapping it, a circle surrounds your finger indicating that you can now slide your finger over several squares in a row or column and it will fill all of them with whatever token you are currently entering.<br /><br />It would be worth a buck or two, particularly if they improved the interface, but the current price is just too much.
B003V6L94Q|5.0|Great band and they do many USO tours.  Hope to get to see them live.  Cardboard cd sleeve, cd sounds great.  Now to buy a couple more of their albums.
B006PZBR8S|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie \\"Real Steel\\".  The movie made boxing seem more interesting.  The robots fighting did not seem as barbaric.  Interesting.  If two autonomous machines are fighting it is more like demolition derby than a physical confrontation.  Atom becomes the peoples champion.
B003AQBYUG|5.0|Received the set in 3 days.  Nice case and set.  Watched the four movie discs; all worked great in an actual bluray player, little goofy on the computer bluray.
B0086T77MG|1.0|I am completely in agreement with the previous reviewers in relation to being charged for this \\"special\\". In the past, any ancillary \\"documentary\\" and \\"preview\\" material has been free of charge to entice viewership, and is generally released BEFORE the actual season.<br /><br />This product was released after the show was done airing, and, therefore, after consumers would logically think to \\"stop payment\\" on their season passes. This is a total insult to consumers committing to Amazon's \\"season pass\\" promotion, as now any discount earned from being a season pass holder is completely mitigated by being automatically charged $1.89 for this NON-EPISODE. Sherlock is a unique show in terms of pricing model due to episode length (each one essentially being its own movie), but a usual (non-HD) show on Amazon costs about $1.89! That is for a 40+ minute full-length episode, and here we are being charged that same price for an almost 9 minute behind the scenes documentary of questionable insight and worth, especially in light of the fact it is a \\"preview\\" of the 2nd season which we have already, presumably, watched since we have already bought it!<br /><br />I find this unacceptable and will reevaluate my \\"season pass\\" buying habits in the future if this is a new \\"feature\\" on Amazon. Even now, one can save considerable money (sometimes as much as HALF in comparison to even \\"discounted\\" season passes of shows in real-time) buying seasons of tv a mere month after their season finales. If anything, committing to a season pass should entitle consumers to ancillary material such as this for free if Amazon wants to continue this (rather dubious) pricing model, not punish us for committing to a show and, unlike individual episode buyers, not being given the OPTION of buying this fluff!
B0086700CM|5.0|you have to play this awesome game. I love it if you don't play it than you'll be sorry for not playing it
B001R0KH3M|5.0|Stevie Wonder: Live At Last! is like being there! He gives his all, singing all of my favorites! And the quality of the DVD is superb.  Would love to attend one of his concerts, but this DVD is certainly the next best thing!  You won't be disappointed!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love this app. It wakes me up every morning for school at 6:30! and if you need help in math, then you can have it set to only solve an equation to stop the alarm!
0393072231|4.0|\\"The Big Short\\" is a great book. It takes an incredibly complicated and fairly arcane story and explains it in terms that are not only understandable, but for which there is drama, humour and insight. That's a rare feat in any book. In one about Credit Default Swaps and Collateralized Debt Obligations, it's well-nigh a miracle.    Which is probably why it spent 28 weeks on the New York Times Bestseller list. Why it was shortlisted for the Financial Times best business book of 2010, and why noted financial blogger Felix [to read the rest of this review, please visit: [...]
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|2004's \\"Stone Cold\\" was the first of the Jesse Stone tv movies, starring Tom Selleck as Robert Parker's hard-nosed former LA cop with a drinking problem and an ex-wife problem, now police chief of the small Maine town of Paradise (Nova Scotia provides the venue).  Tom Selleck inhabits the role perfectly as a man with demons and a good heart, more interested in justice than the law.<br /><br />Paradise's three-person police department will be stretched to its limits with a serial killer or killers on the loose, and the rape of a high school student.  Both will be delicate cases, solved more by Jesse's wiles than by hard evidence or the assistance of the state troopers.  The serial killer will strike close to home before Jesse can arrange a fateful confrontation.<br /><br />This movie plunges right into the plot, without much introduction, a fault made good by the second movie.  Some of the recurring characters are introduced, such as Kohl Suddath as \\"Suitcase\\", one of Jesse's patrolmen, and Stephen McHattie as the state homicide chief.  Viola Davis is superb as Jesse's other deputy.  Mimi Rogers has a deliciously ambiguous role as a high-powered attorney.<br /><br />This movie and its successors are good quality tv movies that take advantage of the small town setting and the character of Jesse Stone to set a contemplative tone.  If you don't like Tom Selleck, don't bother; he carries this and the other movies.  Highly recommended to fans of the Jesse Stone movies.
B0073PPKNM|5.0|First, this is an album full of beautiful, absolutely listenable music - but I do agree with the reviewer who states that the song \\"So Long\\" suffers from a strange clicking that I cannot reconcile with the music at all. I can't understand how it was not detected during the recording or mixdown.<br />Second, for the reviewer who contends that the overall recording was poor, I beg to disagree - and I have an above average stereo system. Excepting the aforementioned clicking, this is an album of nuance and artistry. Melody Gardot is one of those wonderful artists who never loses her core while also never repeating herself. One hears echoes of great artists of the past as she sings, but she is unto herself in mixing those influences with the sensibilities of an old soul in the modern world.<br />\\"The Absence\\" graces us with a five-star talent. Fix the clicks on the one track and the album is five stars as well.<br /><br />Update: Based on the gracious response of Ms. Gardot to Amazon Chuck, I wish to revise my comments. As I have a highly resolving system, my ears interpreted the clicking on \\"So Long\\" as a distraction as it is in timbre close to the sound that I used to hear on poorly cared for vinyl. It also has a correlation to the beat, but is not entirely consistent with it. Understanding it now to be the sound of fingernails tapping interpretively to the music, I appreciate the intent behind it. I can't guess how this tapping will come across on differently resolving systems, but my overall comments from above remain. The music on \\"The Absence\\" - all of it - is beautiful. I hope most of you do not find the tapping on \\"So Long\\" as distracting as I have, and I hope to put my initial impressions of it out of my mind.
B0042L78MG|5.0|This is a great CD. Not one song on it is bad, which is rare these days. You'll find yourself humming these songs for weeks after hearing them.<br /><br />I'm basically a Rock & Roller that likes all kinds of other music. This CD beats out most of the rock & roll I hear today.<br /><br />The songs are a fusion of 30s and 40s big band sound mixed with Jazz & some hiphop and I don't know what else. But the songs are memorable and stick with you. Not like the one note wonder BS you hear today out of groups. This CD crosses so many barriers that young and old will love it. I've listened to Bittersweet and other groups like Caro E. but they may have one or two songs on their CDs that are good, then the rest are so so. I hope all her stuff is this good from now on.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is the best game ever. its addicting by far. I played over 400 games in 2 days. I'm always playing it no matter where I'm at.
B004132HZS|4.0|Masterpiece Mystery has scored a home run with this brilliant, quick-witted, and fast-paced modern re-imagining of Sherlock Holmes.  Moffet's (of Dr. Who fame) creative brilliance shines in this, although at times the manic nature and chasing about of the Sherlock character feels a little too much like Matt Smith's Eleventh Doctor and not enough of a intellect-based, dry-humored detective.  The acting is spot-on, especially in the supporting characters of Watson, Mrs. Hudson, and Molly, written to be wonderful foils and, at times enablers, of the Sherlock character.  Season One is a little unbalanced--Study in Pink is a charming introduction to the characters and situations, but the Blind Banker is slightly off and the ending scenes of season one left me wanting a little more from the build-up with Moriarty than what was actually delivered.  Still, all in all, a wonderful new distraction for all us PBS nerds and a fantastic counter-point to Masterpiece's other recent and wonderful--if completely opposite--series of Downtown Abbey.  Finally, Masterpiece is cool again.
B0086700CM|5.0|i REALLY like this game and for the longest time was sad that i couldnt get it on my knidle.. when i found out u could get it... i was freaking out all over the place! i was and still am so excited! i love this game!
B002GYI9C4|5.0|My favorite part about it was how well he tied everything together, there's just enough foreshadowing to make you want to guess what will happen next, but it's so well written that I had no idea.  Loved it! I just finished all three books.  Very well written and having it on my phone made it so I could read it whenever I had a few mins.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|I started watching this show when it first premiered.  I don't know if it was that I was too busy, or that I was more invested in other shows, but I never latched myself to it.  Then I started reading spoiler free reviews and I heard about alternate realities, string theory, and other science fiction ideas I loved, as well as reading some more quotes from my new favorite character on television, Dr. Walter Bishop, and I decided to give it another try.<br /><br />The story telling.  The science fact and fiction.  The character building and conflict between the universes and within the characters themselves got me so engaged that I immediately bought seasons 2 and 3 and paid to watch season four on Amazon new direct video so that I could catch up.  I would wake up early just so I could watch an episode.<br /><br />I will leave with a quote from Walter, \\"That's the thing about scientific inquiry -- not every experiment is a success. But I hold high hopes for the parmesan ice cream.\\".  Wonder what that would taste like?
B0086700CM|5.0|I am so glad this came out I wish they would make jelly car though.This game is addicting. I want to play it every day
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|If crap could crap and then that crap could crap it would be better then this crap of a movie.<br /><br />So let me get this straight: A plane crashes and a group of men are chased for days by wolves. These men jump off cliffs,survive plunges in freezing water, have no food and still end up in the middle of the wolves den.<br /><br />I hate everyone that had anything to do with this movie...even Kraft's services.
B0073V7YTY|5.0|Very good.  This is the best one that I've tried.  I espeially like the high sensivity and the graphing feature.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love Evernote!  I can sync across my Mac, pc, droid, kindle fire, and even an hp touchpad.  I save travel plans,  notes,  and more.  Great app!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game it is amazing!!! I was wanting to get this game because my friends would have it on their ipods and ipads and finally amazon got it!!!
B004AFFZNI|5.0|The skeleton housing is great for keeping the camera inside the housing while hooking the GoPro up to power, or having access to the SD card without having to remove it from the case.  Obviously not waterproof, this modified housing has allowed me to keep the GoPro running for hours during multi-camera shoots.
B007MDB71O|5.0|i was truly surprised at how much i enjoyed this movie. The special effects were amazing and i was totally entertained the whole time. This is a great movie for family night or even if your just staying home alone on a rainy day. You should definitely check John Carter out!!
1847879071|5.0|If all my textbooks were written like this I am pretty sure I would enjoy reading them a lot more. I am actually not taking any stats classes but wanted to find a book that would be a bit above the level of Stats for Stupids just so I could learn a bit about it. So far this book has far exceeded my expectations, I am learning, understanding, laughing and I keep going back to reading it page by page.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|it started fine but now it will not update or let me will the one game on here. I'm very dissatisfied.
B0086700CM|5.0|At first I had to play it on my iphone but now I can play it on my kindle fire!
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I will make this quick,<br /><br />Friend of mine ask me if I had read the 50 Shades trilogy. I had not heard of it. So looked up the series on Amazon and read some of the reviews. So many people either loved or hated the book. I then found out that the series is supposed to be a \\"Best Seller\\" and that the author E L James sold the rights to turn the series into a movie. So I thought.....couldn't be that bad.....could it?<br /><br />So downloaded the 3 books.....50 Shades of Grey, 50 Shades Darker and 50 Shades Freed. I have tried.....I really have tried to read them all. Finished the first with great difficulty, struggled through the second. I am about 1/3 of the way through the third and I can't take anymore!<br /><br />What I want to know....how the damn $&@$& did these books become a \\"Best Seller\\" for $&@& sake! I just don't get it!!<br /><br />What are the books about? I am sure that by the time you get to my review you will have found out plenty......all I will say is that the male lead character, Christian is a mentally abusive, unadjusted, arrogant, controlling, degrading pig! I honestly can't read any more of his abuse, it's to hard to take it in. He is either caring and affectionate (when he is \\"in the mood\\") or yelling and being abusive to lead character Ana.<br /><br />Honestly.....don't bother.....save your money!
B008469DGY|4.0|For some reason I thought this was going to be an actual golf game where you played a round.  I was disappointed at first, but now I can't put it down!
1469984202|5.0|I'm kind of a tough nut when it comes to books.  There are so many bad ones out there. And I have little tolerance for bad writers.  Then once in a while you stumble across something that sticks.  Solid writing, page turning story and some good philosophical questions that let you sound the deep if you choose.  ...And Viola...  Wool.<br /><br />Apocalyptic as a genre has admittedly been badly abused.  But you will not find an author resorting to zombies or vampire shortcuts here.  This is just really good storytelling.  I read the full Omnibus over the holiday weekend and can't wait for more installments.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game it is the most advenrltrous game ever! and its addicting! it with ur time and money
B005K17RU0|5.0|I live in a city that, frankly, seems to be hard to map and identify for google and other sites. So, it's a treat when I can get accurate weather forecasts!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|The game is easy to understand, works perfectly, and should be fun for anyone who enjoys puzzle games. I find myself challenged, but not overwhelmed by the puzzles. Easily deserving of 5 stars.
B0086700CM|5.0|finally! after all this time u can finally get this game!! I'm never putting my kindle fire down now!!! absolutely the best game ever!!
145162445X|5.0|One of the best reads, lent it to a few friends to read as well. Definitely worth the cash. An amazing book written by a smart man with some content that will really make you think.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I got this app mainly to watch my recorded shows from the Media Center on my PC without having to sit in the computer room.  I can now use this app and watch my computer recorded shows on the couch via my kindle!  Still, it worked as a life saver for me last week because my PC's computer screen went out!  Because of splashtop, I could still get on my computer via my kindle and set up shows I wanted to record, use anything I would normally see on my monitor, but on my kindle until I got a new PC monitor.  Love it!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|you get points to buy new games. its hood for long car ride. passes time. I love this game! GREAT!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I enjoyed the book immensely. Found it entertaining and interesting. I would like to see it carry on to some conclusion as it does seem to stop short of that. I know that it finishes the current story sort of, but could carry onward into the future.
0345803507|5.0|I hope she writes more books like this love story it was very intriguing and now I am sad I finished all three of them in like a week ...
B0086700CM|5.0|it is very fun and challenging. a lot of people have anticipated the arrival of the game temple run for the kindle fire
B005LAIGPU|1.0|Wow. What a waste of an interesting plot. Great special effects (what little there were) wasted in the effort to create a melodrama of teenage angst filmed on a hand-held camera rather than a sci-fi/fantasy film.  The question \\"what would it be like to gain super powers?\\" is answered by this production like this: \\"Waste those powers stupidly because some people are messed up and teens are not that bright\\".  Gee, thanks, that's entertainment?  If I were a teen today I would not find this film enjoyable, I'd find it an insult.
B0086700CM|5.0|fun gamee they finally got it for the kindle!!!!!!!!  jj h u j jgufn j jsj hxjcydhjh h&amp;!%?&amp;&amp; hsh gxjdg

B0086700CM|2.0|I normally LOVE this app, but I have only played on ipads. On my Fire, after 125k it starts lagging and I just have to quit. Dont get it for you kindle.

B007RV6X2Y|5.0|the ending is such a sick twist this was awesome!!! what a ride this one got me at the end I love this kind of movie L)
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting so long for this to come on the kindle fire. Atlast its here! I haven't stopped playing it and have no idea why it would be rated one star. :)
B0086700CM|5.0|This is such an entertaining game. I love it. It is such a good time waster and I play it constantly!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was skeptical about this book to start with because I had heard about it, and all my friends were divided on it.  They either loved it or hated it.  The ones who hated it were shocked by the graphic bondage sex.  I personally thought, \\"Well, I like sex, and you never know if you like it if you don't try it, so why not?\\"  I quickly saw that I could identify with Anastasia, not seeing myself as attractive, but feeling that The Red Room of Pain was fascinating.  Also, the dynamic of the relationship between Christian and Ana enthralled me unlike any other book I've read.  I literally could not put it down.  I've almost finished the third book now, and I can honestly say this trilogy is a scintillating, compassionate, sexy, loving, and intriguing body of fiction.  Christian and Ana are a must read! ;o)
B003U55J9Y|5.0|**Spoilers of the final scene**<br />This finale was amazing.  It tied up the loose ends that were the most important, and let others to the imagination.  I honestly can't think a satisfactory explanation for many of the questions brought up throughout the six seasons, and no answer is better than a crappy one.  As for the ending itself I've run into so many people saying, \\"I called it all along, the island was purgatory\\"...NO IT WAS NOT.  The sideways flashes are purgatory, but I repeat the island and everything that happened on it was NOT.  If that's what you thought about the finale then you clearly didn't understand it, and I implore you to watch season 6 again (or at least just the finale).  Christian Shepard says during the finale, \\"'Yea I'm real.  You're real, everything that's every happened to you is real.  All those people in the church, they're all real too' and 'There is no now in this place.  Some of them died before you and others long after you.'\\"<br /><br />Lost, as much as people may think otherwise, was 100% about character development.  Yes at the end of each week we had new questions and were intrigued by the lore of the island, but in the end it was all about how the characters effected each others lives and how they were intertwined with each other.  This was the perfect ending, and it was epitomized by what Christian Shepard says, \\"This is a place that you all made together so that you could find one another...The most important part of your life was the time that you spend with these people.  That's why all of you are here.  Nobody does it alone Jack.  You needed all of them, and they needed you.\\"
B0086700CM|1.0|this app is very slow and scratchy.  and when on the ipad you run 500000 miles a min. here you only run 5 miles a min.  I would mot reccomend this all at all
0525423281|5.0|What can I say? Stephanie Perkins creates contemporary magic. LOLA AND THE BOY NEXT DOOR was witty, and quite simply, irresistible. I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />Perkins hooked me with the mystery on why the main character, Lola, had such built up anger at Cricket, the boy next door. Now I will say the name Cricket threw me off. It didn't exactly scream hot guy. BUT it fit the love interests character. Cricket was quirky, just like his name.<br /><br />The narrative Perkins created with Lola felt authentic. I totally believed she was that rebellious chick from my high school who didn't give a damn about what people thought about her clothes. She was only concerned about pleasing her inner artist. So it was awesome to tap into a character like that. Lola was totally kick ass, and I loved her.<br /><br />Lola's older boyfriend, Max was definitely a hot character. And let's face it, there's something alluring about older guys to teenage girls. Rebellion comes to mind. I loved reading about them. The last YA novels that come to mind with an older love interest was Vampire Academy and Going To Far. So it was great to read that same twist here. Added some spice. Plus he was a rocker. Who doesn't like reading about HOT rocker dudes?<br /><br />Another thing I liked about this novel was the cameo appearance by Anna and St. Clair from ANNA AND THE FRENCH KISS. I freakin' loved that book and was so happy to read a little more about them.<br /><br />So if you are a YA contemporary fan, add this one to your list!

B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is my first Amazon review if that tells you how strongly I feed about this.  I cannot believe the hype this book is getting - and canNOT believe it's a bestseller!  This is quite possibly the worst book I've ever read.  The writing is amateurish at best, too much simple dialogue and the characters are so shallow.  Obviously the subject matter is the draw, but if you want erotica, I'm pretty sure you could throw a dart at a list of titles and come up with much better material.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I made it through book one and two. They were sluggish and repetitious at times but kept my attention.  This one took repetition to a whole new level and had me rolling my eyes.  I rarely quit books but by 28% of the way through I'd had enough.  Fell victim to the hype.

1401937519|5.0|This book has revolutionized my way of thinking about illness, death and religion. It's amazing medically well-documented testimony of Anita Moorjani, because not only had the experience of going to another realm but was cured of terminal cancer grade 4, in less than 5 days. She point out how important is the \\"INCONDITIONAL LOVE\\", after all \\"GOD IS LOVE\\"

B001QTXM5Y|5.0|At the price, I expected something quite worn. to my surprise, the Directors Cut cosisted of TWO dvds',both of excellent quality and 180 minues long instead of the usual 116-120.  Very pleased with my purchase and makes a nice addition to my dvd library.
B0086700CM|5.0|I like Temple Run because it is a lot of fun. You get to earn money .Have a great time playing!

B007R3AZNK|5.0|I am a 58 year old man and I still enjoy some good old Rock and Roll blues. Joe is great on the guitar.  Great music to get you started in the morning.  I have a 30 minute commute to work.  Joe rocks.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great game, but they need to fix the updating issue. It wont update for Me and its really annoying to have it pop up andxnot work.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|pretty cool way to pass some time. point system is a little whacked. I'm writing this. review to get. 250,000 points.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|Have recently downloaded &quot;hidden&quot; object apps that were more suited for pre-schoolers. Not challenging at all but this game is fun; objects well hidden; and puzzles make you think! I really think Alawar did a fantastic job with this game and I am only three levels into it! Hours of fun to come and I may let my son borrow my Kindle Fire to play this too. Zero trouble downloading it and maybe those who did have wi-fi connectivity issues? All good here! Keep the great games coming!
B000V6BE6C|4.0|this is a great album. arrived on time, in good condition, no major flaws or defects. Played correctly, cosmetically a little scuffed and scratched but still in working order.
0143117009|4.0|This was an excellent book because it shows the truths about how close our modern day civilization is to collapsing. This book shows different civilizations strengths and weaknesses and what truly caused them to decline. He discusses 12 different environmental reasons as to why societies collapse and that is his main argument for most of the book. He points out that there other a few other reasons why a society might decline but environmental reasons why the main reason. He is worried about our modern day society failing because of pollution and many more reasons. He states how people know what is happening but choose to do nothing. You should definitively read this book, even if you're not interested in economics or the study of societies because it gives you a different outlook to view modern day society. He has definitively done his research for this book so it is easy to trust his knowledge.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Great game for kids and to keep their entertained! It also can help them have a good or even better imagination :)
B005LAIHPE|4.0|I like intelligent science fiction films, but every now and then I get a craving for a mindless action flick.  Battleship delivers the sci-fi and action components (emphasis on the action) but leaves out much of the intelligence.  That's OK because that's what I expected, and I enjoyed it for what it is.<br /><br />The story (such as it is) is simple:  An alien flotilla arrives on Earth and hides in the Pacific Ocean near Hawaii.  A U.S. naval fleet is conducting exercises in the neighborhood.  Mayhem ensues.<br /><br />The CGI effects are fantastic, and they bring to life some intense combat scenes.  If you liked Transformers, you'll like Battleship.  There's a fair amount of humor as well, especially toward the beginning.  The scene where Taylor Kitsch's character goes to extreme lengths to get a burrito for a girl is actually based almost frame for frame on actual surveillance footage of a comical burglary of a convenience store which occurred several years ago.  This movie could be a 2 hour long recruiting video for the Navy.  Fighting ships and all forms of naval hardware are showcased left and right.<br /><br />Before the movie was released, a lot of people made quips about how elements of the original board game would be incorporated into the film.  Well... that's exactly what they did!  The main defensive weapon on the alien ships hurls explosive shells that are shaped like the plastic pegs used in the game.  There's a scene during a night battle where naval officers are breathlessly staring at a computer-generated grid while a captain gives out targeting coordinates for missle strikes.<br /><br />There is a long list of things in this film that just made no sense.  For example, the aliens in the film are a paradox.  They have ships that can travel across light years in no time and can generate impenetrable energy shields.  On the other hand, their ships' main defensive weapons are no more effective than conventional artillery.  And for a space-faring race,they don't seem to be very smart.<br /><br />Despite its many flaws, I still enjoyed Battleship enough to give it 4 stars.  It doesn't deserve 4 stars, but it's just a fun movie.  It just requires a big dose of suspension of disbelief.
1933633867|5.0|A bracing, utterly enjoyable book embodying the essence of the word \\"scholarship.\\" I didn't know anything about the author until I was way deep into the book, which was a good thing. Then, having read up on Mr. Graeber, I was struck by the relative lack of polemics (given that he's \\"the Occupy Guy\\"). I am now up to Chapter 4 of my second pass through this fine, timely book.
B0053O89JM|5.0|Say...AAHHH...Ha Ha Ha :)<br />Can't wait for my copy to arive !<br />The Good Doctor arives on 08-21-2012, DVD with 22 shows on five disks, & published by Universal (SRP is $59.98). Extras have not been announced as of yet. The last episode is worthy of the entire eight years spent on the Fox TV network. THANK YOU to everyone involved with this program :)<br />Be well, have fun, & GOD bless !!!<br />JWC II<br />PS: You will find 5 disks hanging onto 3 spindles, this will lead to an early demise of the DVD set. Most cost effective remeady, use a double DVD case holder, copy the box cover (& trim to fit) marking the cover as for disk No.4 & 5, and insert a paper barrier between the two DVD's inside the case. At the recommended price for any DVD this practice of \\"piggy-backing\\" disks is indefensible. Public domain title publishers (such as for the 1950's Robin Hood TV series) allow for better packaging by placing each disk in a protective sleave.<br />The Universal Pictures packaging rates \\"NO\\" stars & a grade of \\"F\\" ... :( :( :(<br />08/27/2012<br />JWC II
B00004YTIQ|3.0|I would love to figure out how they got the cover so tight in the picture. It comes with a cord that you are supposed to put through the holes to keep the cover on. We have yet to figure out how to get it tight so when it rains it doesn't go down in the middle. I'm sure it will be fine once we figure it out!
B005QUQP76|4.0|Bought this mouse after reading a few reviews and having owned a ridiculous number of gaming mice (Copperhead, DeathAdder, Orochi, MX500, MX518, G5, G9x, G500, Kinzu, Xai, Sensei) and I have to say, it's probably the most accurate mouse I have ever used.  Coming from Sensei, this seriously accurate. The feel is excellent. Only thing that causes it not to get 5 stars is the fact that the software is still in Beta. Some good updates to software and I can see great things for this mouse in Corsair's future. I have actually increased my accuracy by 20% in MW3 alone based on stats and that does say a lot.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I loved Book One and Two, I thought they were so cleverly written and the characters were so believable, I couldn't put my Kindle down.The imagination of the Author never failed to amaze me.<br /><br />The third book was a little disappointing, I began to get annoyed with Katniss who reverted from the strong independent female of the early books into a rather wimpy character who kept having nervous breakdowns. It seemed that her breakdowns and isolation were used by the Author to let a lot happen in the outside world, but she didn't need to describe it to us, although I really wanted to know. The long hard fight to get to the centre of the Capitol to kill the President was all for nothing when the freedom fighters had got there before them anyway, so a bit pointless and a dreadful waste of life? And it wasn't clear what had happened to Gale and Pete there.<br /><br />I felt Gale changed dramatically from the protective bright boy of Book One and bacame rather selfish and self important, and I was fed up that the most likeable characters kept being killed off! I would have preferred to have had a few nice people left at the end other than Katniss and good old Pete who had been taking a less and less important role as the book went on.<br /><br />The whole story was a fascinating premise, however, and I will now read more books by this Author.
B0086700CM|5.0|don't listen to the one star reviews this is a great app ive been looking all over the app store but couldn't find it and it just came out I woud highly recemand it to anyone great app. this game is probably or and the best app ever
B004YD1KTO|4.0|An excellent annd unusual book. It's a rather sad story, but cleverly written. The Author grabs you from the begining and makes you want to find out what happens to the characters, so you can't put it down. Rosamund Lipton is a clever writer and I look forward to her next book!
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I had never played this game but had always been curious about it. I had heard it mentioned several times by others. It is addictive and at times frustrating but really fun. Best of all, it was free!!
B007H7XJD4|3.0|We tried watching this, but the video had to stop repeatedly in order to load. We ended up just turning it off. I'm sure the video would have been great, but the repeated loading was aggravating.

0307951529|4.0|So what do you call Chris Guillebeau? Writer? World-traveler? Publisher of the blog The Art of Non-Conformity? Well, all of those would be apt, but they only scratch the surface. With this, his second book afte the great [[ASIN:0399536108 The Art of Non-Conformity: Set Your Own Rules, Live the Life You Want, and Change the World]], he cements his status as entrepreneur, teacher, and inspiration.<br /><br />The $100 Startup covers the \\"how-to\\" for those inclined to transform an idea into a profitable business. Fortunately, this is not just a book of theory on what should work. These are methods proven to work for the author and many others possessed of the entrepreneurial mindset.<br /><br />Chris gives you actionable guidelines that are drawn from his own experience building a successful enterprise. As well he pulls data from exhaustive research conducted over years of interviews and profiles of 1,500 self-starters who have built fruitful operations for themselves.<br /><br />On top of dozens of case studies provided in the book, there is in-depth, specific information on how to handle everything from writing a business plan (hint: it rarely takes more than a single page) to a step-by-step blueprint for initiating a product launch. Each chapter covers a different aspect of getting started. The main take-aways from the book are in the areas of marketing, fund-raising, and motivation.<br /><br />While the title is catchy, the truth of the matter is that some of the businesses profiled did cost more than $100 to start up, but the biggest percentage of them cost LESS than $100 with $125 being the median. So, any arguments you may have about a lack of money, a lack of experience, or a lack of incentive will be addressed by this book. And to make sure that you don't miss out on the lessons he's teaching you, Chris gives you a summary of key points to take away at the end of each chapter.<br /><br />If you've got (approximately) a hundred bucks and a desire to master your own financial and occupational fate, this book is a good place to begin. It gives you the instruction you need to replicate the success of others. The actual work is up to you. Get the book and get started!own financial and occupational fate, this book is a good place to begin. It gives you the instruction you need to replicate the success of others.

B007XKEY6Q|5.0|It is so fantastic. Fun to draw random thingys. It deserves two thumbs up. I like drawing with friends. I like having options to draw different things and it makes me laugh when I see peoples drawings. I also like the comment option. It allows me to tell the person how cool or funny their picture is. Live this app!!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so addicting!!!!!! Once you start playing, it impossible to put it down. I couldn't stop!!!! I LOVE it!!!
B0024FAR5M|5.0|Had a lil hiccup with first product , but i am very happy  with the fast , courteous attention received to remedy the situation !!! I have been wanting this for a long time and i am all smiles :-)  i will definately gonna be a repeat customer !!!
B00001QEG5|4.0|Way more consistent than \\"Stay Hungry\\" (which had some great songs) and \\"Come Out and Play\\" (which didn't suck), it's a return to the much more fun sound of \\"Can't Stop Rock and Roll.\\" Not only is the title track one of their best songs but the cover is one of the all-time greatest.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|I am so happy with this purchase , great service and product !! Fast shipping !! I am thrilled been wanting this for a long time , I AM ALL SMILES :-)
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I don't really rate movies specially via a web site, but this one truly moved me, I bought the movie just for the heck of it, I have found my Akita mix Shiloh, or should I say, Shiloh found me a little over two years now, and I see all the tendencies I see in Hutchi. I can't wait for myself to get home and spend time with him, luckily I was able to keep my dog with my family while I'm at work, but as soon as I find myself a place local to work, i'm getting him a companion! :) Love every single minute of this movie and I will always will enjoy watching it.
0061801313|5.0|Pretty Little Liars by Sara Shepard is the first book in the Pretty Little Liars series. Alison DiLaurentis, Aria Montgomery, Emily Fields, Spencer Hastings, and Hanna Marin are the \\"it\\" girls of Rosewood. Only in 7th grade, the girls embark on a series of adventures together bonding them closer; each one mainly to Ali. Ali is a manipulative girl who can make anyone totally love or hate her. One night at Spencer's, Ali goes missing and the girls begin to go their separate ways. However, the girls all come back to each other because they're being black-mailed by someone who knows all of the things they do and all of their deep dark secrets that they only told Ali.<br /><br />This book is just a taste of the Pretty Little Liars series, but it leads you to need to read the next book. This series was designed to completely involve your mind within the girls' story. It's a story of friendship and danger; these aren't your every day high school girls. Pretty Little Liars is so interesting and worth the read.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Everything you could ask for. It's what I have come to expect from MobilityWare. Great job and keep up the good work.
B004MMEF30|5.0|An all-time classic which was probably my first Sherlock Holmes story.  Well-written and easy to follow, but does require an ability to think in the terms that Doyle wrote.  Since he wrote in a different era, don't expect modern English.
0618918248|1.0|I believe people call themselves atheists instead of Satanists to get more people to belief their outlandish rhetoric. Its a shame so many of them control our news and entertainment media as well as academia. People need to be made aware of what's happening, but I wouldn't suggest buying this book to support this devils' philosophy and make him wealthy for his horrifying writings. I also notice, mostly from their videos on youtube, that Bill Maher and Suze Orman are also atheists.
0345803507|1.0|FIFTY SHADES OF INSIPID: Yes, folks, I read the entire god-awful trilogy. I was able to do this because, after a certain level of exposure, the trite writing style and paper-thin character development no longer consumed my entire attention. And while the tediously repetitious sex scenes never ceased to grate on my nerves much like the incessantly repeated verbs, I learned that it is possible to skip them entirely as they add nothing whatever to the story. This leaves us with the story. There is one, but it is so ludicrously unbelievable as to inspire nothing but distain for the two-dimensional protagonist and an oddly satisfying anti-lust for her one-dimensional lover/husband/foil.<br />We are to believe that a gawky, poorly-educated, simpering idiot virgin of a girl somehow incites the passions of a megalomaniacal billionaire business mogul. Lest you think this is a sweet Cinderella story, think again. Our billionaire also happens to be a sexual sadist who likes to beat little brown-haired girls half to death in his expensively appointed penthouse dungeon. But, hey, he's rich! And he beats girls with really nice canes and expensive leather whips, so it's not like ordinary trailer-trash domestic violence, right?<br />We are also to believe that our young, virginal, and clearly not very bright young lady falls head over heels in love with this sicko, moves in with him a couple of weeks after meeting him, marries him shortly after that, and is thrilled to be expecting his child in a few short months. (Spare yourself the sex scenes in the third book, which include our very pregnant heroine being flogged across the belly by her oh-so-loving sadist husband. I am not kidding. E.L. James knows no boundaries whatsoever.)<br />If you have a taste for perverse literature, there are much better writers available to scratch that peculiar little itch. If you are reading this crap just because everyone else is reading it, be my guest. This story is too insipid to traumatize anyone. Clamber on into it; maybe it will make you blush, flush, and bite your lip! Most likely, though, you'll just roll your eyes at the sheer tedium of the author's inadequacies.
B0086700CM|5.0|I cant believe that after this long I can finally get temple run on my kindle it is so great I am so happy
B007JM4CWY|4.0|I am enjoying this game so very much. The puzzles gradually increase in diffficulty making this an exciting challenge for the average enthusiasm.  I would recommend this game if for no other reason then to excersie your Mind-clean out the cobwebs a little and have some strategic fun!

B0086700CM|5.0|I really dont't understand how people can complain about this game. It is so fun and entertaining! I play volleyball so pretty much every seemed I'm going to to places hours away. Temple Run helps me keep busy. I reccomend this game to EVERYONE! :)
B000I2JKCO|1.0|I attempted to play this DVD for my grandson and got the error message that my player could not read the DVD.  I'd give it no stars but the system won't let me leave that blank.

B002VPE1WK|5.0|This bag is nice, well constructed and fits well when all straps are adjusted.  I got this bag as a part of my D 5100 purchase just today and will serve me well while I am in the USA doing picture things; however,I am leaving for China, Thailand, and Vietnam in a few months and will be bringing my laptop, camera, and backpack.  There is no place for my laptop in this case, (if it was just a little bigger) so I will be buying another case for my camera and laptop while traveling overseas and wear it on my front while the backpack will sit on my back.  Overall a great case especially since I didn't pay for it. (lol)
B0086700CM|5.0|so much FUN!!!!!!I wish I cod play it all day!!!!!!! U SHOD TRAI IT!!!!!!&quot;LOVE IT &quot;!!!!!!!!!!TEMPLE RUN IS SO MUCH FUN!!!!

1596912863|4.0|This was my second time to read Austenland, and I liked it even better this time. Jane's obsession with the romance in the BBC Pride and Prejudice movie made me want to watch it. I found some clips on the BBCWorldWide channel on You Tube if you're interested.<br /><br />Jane is someone you really want to root for. The poor girl (woman actually since she's 32) has had a rough love life. Boyfriend after boyfriend turn out to be disappointments. Before the chapters there's a story about each of Jane's \\"boyfriends\\" from 4 years old to present. Some were hilarious, some embarrassing, and some just plain sad. I so wanted Jane to be able to find true love.<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of Jane Austen's books. I've read them all, some multiple times. I would love to go to an Austenland, but maybe one with married couples allowed. I just want to go dress up and learn the dances and go to a ball.<br /><br />If you haven't read this book you need. It's plain fun, and a short read too. There's a movie being made so get it read before it comes out.
B0086700CM|5.0|it is oje of the best game ever. i got it for my kindle and the grafics r amaxing. definately get it.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|An absolute joy to watch!  Few guitarists play with such feel, and Joe's range is on full and glorious display at the Royal Albert Hall.  A triumph for Bonamassa and his band, and one of my very favorite performances by a true master at his instrument.
B0086700CM|5.0|This app is soooooo addicting, it is also really fun. Don't listen to the people that say it is &quot;ok&quot; cause it is really AWESOME!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|This is an app that is extremely popular in the Apple world but had not made it's way over to Android and I for one am happy that it did. I like the game quite a bit as do my boys.<br /><br />It's basically a game that involves running and avoiding the monkeys in pursuit and jumping, ducking and not falling into the water. It's a fun game and I'm glad it came to the Fire.
B0086700CM|1.0|I couldnt wait to get this app.  Now whenever I try to install it, my phone reboots and won't install. Fix the problem or at least inform that it wont work on some phones.
B0086700CM|4.0|Finally, Kindle Fire has this in the app store. Game is very addictive but it has a sudden glitch which is irritating when I tend to slide or jump. Other than that, its great. Get it!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|The game is so fun! Its a great way to pass time or just to have fun. I rate this five stars
B0073LWEXK|4.0|Beats out both Grizzly Manor and Crimson Manor. And the use of a notebook to auto write clues was perfect so we don't waste time trying to find a pen!
B006IOK66K|4.0|Just a quick word about this album on vinyl.<br /><br />Fist of all, it was delayed. They promised it back in February 2012, at the same time the cd was coming out. But then nothing came and there was no date the vinyl would be delivered here in the USA. Silence. And I think in the UK it came out without delay.<br /><br />Finally they started selling in at the end of May. I just got my copy. Alas, all the excitement about the album was gone since I had gotten the cd a long time ago.<br /><br />It is a good album. Not their best, I think, but still quite good.<br /><br />The vinyl is a single, black in color LP in a single sleeve. Not heavy 180g vinyl, but it still plays fine.<br />The inner sleeve is quite thick and has a nice colorful picture of the band on one side and all the lyrics to the songs on the other. I like it.<br /><br />The LP comes with a code for MP3 download of the album.<br /><br />Solid 4 stars for me. Would definitely recommend this album on vinyl.
B005USZYDU|3.0|Another great work by John Grisham.  His ability to make you feel you are there, trying to help Theo get the info to the proper people and keep the trust of his friends makes it hard to put down.  Once you start, you will not want to stop.  Cant wait for another.  He makes you feel you a part of book.
B004HEXSLI|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I am buying another as a gift for my son who is going to be starting occupational therapy school soon.  I would recommend it to anyone in the medical field who works with patients that have had a stroke.  I would also recommend this to anyone who has had a family member or friend who has had a stroke.  Personally I was completely intrigued by her educational experience, and then her stroke experience.  Beautifully written!<br />  What a gift Jill Bolte Taylor has given to the world!
B004LROUNG|4.0|Another Grisham masterpiece.  The shifts and suprises were non stop and the ending was great.  Highly recommend to anyone who thinks they can figure everything out early.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Awesome book. Would reccomend for any couple. Really helps you to see how to communicate in an efficient way to your mate.

0470901071|5.0|I came across the CCNA book on Amazon first, and decided to buy it after looking through the reviews. I have owned some of the Cisco press books, and they worked very well as pillows for me, because I used to sleep on them every single time I opened them. But I absolutely love this book. It not only helped me pass my CCNA but contains a wealth of information that's hard to find in the same place, at the same time. It is a very easy read and there is some humor which definitely helps when you are reading 800 pages and want to concentrate. I have also read his CCENT book and I like that one too....I highly recommend this book for CCNA exams.
B0086700CM|5.0|It's fun, you collect coins, slide, jump, and run. If you like games where you get chased by something, this is game for you.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book is similar to Fifty Shades of Grey and it is just as good! It has a it all in this books. Sex, love twists, attractions, excitement, and great characters. If you liked Fifty Shades, you will love this book. I cant wait for the next series to come out so I can learn more about the characters!
0307917509|4.0|Eat the snow!  Kinky little story written by someone who is obviously a pervert.  Good crime scene story, but with a sexual side to it.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|CrossMe is a fun way to blow 10-15 minutes on something to get your brain in gear. Think of it as a crossword or sudoku; something  get your mind running, but you can take a break from or come back to later.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I am so surprised this book is such a big hit. I found it extremely disturbing and have been unable to finish it. It really bothers me to think of young girls I know reading this book.  I have a 29 year old married daughter. I called her and asked her not to read the book.
B005LAIHEA|1.0|This is the worst movie ever!!! Not funny at all.  Should not have been made.  Wanted my money back.  I would have walked out but it was Mother's Day and guess who picked this movie...well don't waste your time with this movie.
B007X16GFC|3.0|Contraband is a fun, rompus ride. If you're looking for something fresh and new, it is not that. Contraband feels like several other movies with some new packaging. It doesn't quite have the edge-of-your-seat fun of Shooter, but it's still a great option if you're a Wahlberg fan and action junkie.
B0086700CM|5.0|never gets boring! always play when you have nothing to do. absolutely worth 5 stars. will not disappoint anyone. lots o fun
B002NQ3AAQ|5.0|When you find a story line that impacts your thoughts and attitude---it's worth seeing.  Billy Elliot has a great story line about acceptance and unconditional love between a Father and Son.
B0044DEAUA|2.0|I like this device and it works fine when connected.  However, it will not stay paired with my Samsung Epic 4G.  I have tried reseting the device and running the pairing process several times.  I always leave the device on, as required, but once I leave the vicinity and return, I have to go through the pairing process from the beginning.  This means I am only likely to bother doing this if I'm going to drive on a longer trip and want to take the time to set this up.  Very disappointing.  I'll be looking for a better alternative.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its just like Mario! its a ton of fun! I like it a lot and I would reccommend it to anyone who likes mario
B007MDB71O|5.0|I, like most of the movie-going world, skipped this flick. That's too bad. After watching it after the fact, I wish I would have seen it in 3D. It brings to life one of the classic SF pulp series, with an \\"everyman\\" protagonist (John Carter) and a believable supporting cast of aliens, humanoids, machines and landscapes. Watching the first five minutes of John Carter when he's on Mars, you'll find yourself thinking \\"So that's where the idea of Superman came from!\\"<br /><br />This movie was a treat to watch, and one I'll undoubtedly view many more times, James Cameron admits that the John Carter books were his inspiration for Avatar, and after watching this movie, you can see where the books have impacted SF for generations. Edgar Rice Burroughs started writing his Barsoom stories in 1912, at the height of the Mars hysteria. He envisioned ships that sail on light (solar powered aircraft), Astral Projection and more. His scientific ideas, like those of Jules Verne, were considered outlandish. Today, they are almost a reality.<br /><br />Do yourself (and the studio!) a favor and get this movie. It will make a great addition to any SF collection! No, it's not that true to the books - they were more of an inspiration. Carter's leaping ability and strength are over exaggerated, and the other races changed significantly. If Disney would have left some of these aspects, I'm sure the movie would have done much better. Unfortunately, Carter comes off as a clumsy superman.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I have so much fun playing this game, I am addicted! I can play with friends and family of all ages, and the imagination everyone uses with limited colors and drawing ability is hilarious
B006ZCWTXS|5.0|Who the hell is this girl, she sounds like a seasoned woman \\"of a certain age\\" A truly amazing talent!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game. Im glad it's finally on the Kindle Fire. So much better playing on here than my cellphone.
0345803485|4.0|Well, I've read many erotic love stories over the years. None of them is for the faint of heart and neither is the Fifty Shades Trilogy.<br /><br />Christian Grey is a very complex and damaged character. Ana Steele starts off a bit wimpy but soon shows she has a real backbone. There is a little too much eye widening and gasping from the two of them along with a good helping of 'he wants me....he wants me not'. I was really looking forward to reading more about Christian's childhood in order to see what makes him tick.  We get some information, but I think Ms. James could have devoted a little less time on spankings and more on an explanation of his early years. All in all though, these were good books to read.  You really do get invested in the Ana/Christian relationship and root for them to have a happy ending. I thought the Jack character was a bit of a pat villian and his reason for doing what he did was kind of weak.<br /><br />These books are a great escape from the ho-hum daily grind. Read them with fun in mind and don't worry about typos, occasionaly bad sentence structure or anything else mentioned from other reviewers.  Fifty Shades is fifty ways to just have a little mental escape and maybe get a few naughty ideas as well!!!<br />Read and enjoy!!!!
B007Z9QWVK|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie, two love stories in one film. If you want to watch a true love story, watch this movie! Loved it!
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|I loved this movie because they didn't start this series off with Captain America being all modern.  And this was a great segue into the Avengers movie.  Well done.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game so much I had it on my android but I wanted it on my kindle fire but they never made one on here so I bought it right away I was so happy thank you for making it people.
B0086700CM|5.0|ADDICTING!  I've been waiting for this for my Kindle Fire.  I'm sure a lot of work is involved in the process; it was worth the wait.  Thanks!
B007SYWFRM|1.0|when I first got it the game said ..................... downloading 0.00 Mb -21.31 Mb. next thing unstalled. I hats this game.
B0086700CM|5.0|This app is part of a new era of app creating like ROVIO and OMGPOP. I had never even heard of Temple Run until my friend showed it to me. It's funny, because when he showed it to me, I would wake up in the middle of the night and play it on his Ipod. This app is not my favorite app, but it's a great one. Sorry to change the topic, but if you don't already have FarmStory by TeamLava, download it now it's a great app if your in to taking care of things. Download Temple Run now don't even finish reading just download it.
B003TH2LA8|1.0|Lets first start off saying that it is comendable to cast / crew / and writers for trying to make a tv series based upon such wonderfully detailed and image inspiring books. More commendable is that they even got the second season to come out. This  however, is were they praise sadly ends. A comparison that a wise old man once told me pretty much sums this up - The reason you wear brown pants to battle is to hide the crap that is taken when faced with overwelming fear of the coming situation - ... This tv series though trying to show why the books were so good, actually tears the books apart and makes a gross characture of the beauty found in the pages. Now dont get me wrong as stated above there is some praise but, this is just too painful to watch.<br /><br />I would highly suggest skipping this. If the title does catch your interest though, pick up the book or kindle version of \\" Wizard's First Rule\\" by terry goodkind as this is the first book for which this series is based.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is by far one of the best free games on the app store.  It is really fun, and no ads.  what makes it the best is the mere fact that, while you have the option to buy coins to get more upgrades/new characters, the game isn't so hard that you have to, plus the upgrades aren't extremely valuable except to keep you alive or increase your coin banks, and the characters are purely aesthetic, to the best of my knowledge. If you like a challenge with immense replay value, this is a must have.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love tr! although it could use some minor modifications like accepting last minute turns, jumps, and slides. temple run needs a few adjustments.  I rest my case.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been dying for this game to come out for the kindle fire. otz a really fun and addicting game<br /> the graphics are great and the controls also work really well. :) I highly recomend thisbgame to anyone.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is very fun.  There are many diffrent games you can unlock.  It will keep you and your kids entertained for hours.
B0086700CM|5.0|I enjoy this game very much I couldn't wait till it got released for kindle fire I have a highscore of almost 2,000,000
B007SGM084|5.0|This is quite possibly the most addictive series I have ever read.  The writing could use some polishing sure, but the story is heart stopping.  It's not all about the erotica either, although that is good.  I loved how the author brought them together on both of their terms, not one or the other.  As I have my own 50(Not quite as bad), I can appreciatte Ana's struggles.  But she also has her own issues.  I am really sick of the Twilight references.  I hate Twilight, and I probably would not have read this if I had known before.  It was written on a fan site origanally, yes.  That is where the similarities end.  Twilight is for little girls, THIS IS NOT!  That being said I am a 50 addict.  I think I may need a 12 step program.  Paging Dr. Flynn.
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|who ever says that it takes up all the space on a kindle fire is wrong I have this and many many other apps with space to spare
B0086700CM|5.0|this is a fun addictive game. the kindle responds well to the tilt and finger movements. I got it free and I don't even notice any ads.
B0086700CM|5.0|I just love temple run I cant put it down I rate 5 star if your thinking about buy it and besides its free! No doubt you should get it you'll love it.
B000M9BPEY|1.0|This was my first purchase of  a Blur Ray movie from Amazon.  I am unable to play them in Australia  as they are dedicated to Zone 1, which means it will only play in the Americas. There is NO NOTIFICATION that such product has this LIMITATION and therefore is sold without this disclosure. I cannot return it as the packaging has been opened. Some attention to correct this would be wise.
B0086700CM|5.0|its totally awesome.you will play it once and then you will just keep playing. it s addicting.played it once you will never go back
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Great puzzle game. Easy to pick up and yet it gets challenging gradually.<br /><br />Definitely can use a save or ckeckpoint feature to easily go back a known good state. It can be frustrating and error-prone trying to roll back multiple trial steps with the simple undo.
0345803485|1.0|I try to make a habit of being familiar with works that make a splash in our cultural milieu, for better or for worse, and I wanted to read this too, given what a sales phenomenon it has become. It turned out to be one of the very few times in my life when I could not actually finish a book I had set out to read.<br />If this had been an essay written by a middle school student, it would not make passing grade. The same cliches are repeated ad nauseam, and, sorry to be rather crass, but I'm pretty sure I've seen better dialogue in porno movies... It is a sad day for humanity when this is a NYT best seller...<br />The story line and characters are infantile at best. The erotic aspect is contrived, disconnected, and fitting more with a conversation between 12 year olds than with adult erotica.<br />And the writing, oh, lord help us, the writing... The author makes brilliant use of a vocabulary of about 200 words, in which \\"blushing\\" \\"Jeez\\", \\"WHAT?!\\" and a few simplistic phrases are recycled over and over... The phrasing is so stilted and forced that it makes reading a chore. About twice on every page the main character has her heart in her throat, and she blushes about 5 times in the same span. And no, this is not an elaborate ironic device; this is the extent of the author's imagination and creative prowess...<br />The fact that such an abomination gets printed would be mildly amusing if this was found where it belongs, in the tabloids displayed by the check-out in the grocery store. That it is a huge commercial success, receiving actual praise from some readers, is depressing and scary.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting and waiting for this game on the kindle fire!! I always ask my bff to play this on her iphone and I felt bad I kept asking her for it but now I don't have to. :) thank u jesus!!!! lil!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|great....the best book period...great app. would recommend this to anyone, great for the whole family. We take time every night to read before bed.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting for a long time:) I have been playing this on my brother's I pod touch.I couldn't wait till it came out on the kindle fire:)
B006RUJST6|5.0|Incredible. This book touched my heart in so many ways. I fell in love with all of the characters. Especially Will - what an amazing person. Such a beautiful, emotional read - I laughed and cried. I can't even put in to words how much I loved it.<br /><br />Also - big points for the Chuck Norris jokes. That was just awesome.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a really fun game. This game is very simple and you could spend hours playing it. 5 stars all the way!!!!!
B005LAIGNC|5.0|good special effects but story is a little lacking. fair tribute to the pilots and their endeavors and what they had to go through to get basic respect. total bs and unfair at the time of the war.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|This app is a lot of fun to play.  So far every puzzle works great no problems. The app has an issue in the Kindle when it is shut down improperly.  If you quit the app with the bottom arrow or the Home icon the app will not properly clear the active memory and will give you a blank screen when you try to run it again.  If you do a complete shut down of the device it will clear and start right the next time you run it.  It does not need to be uninstalled then reinstalled.  If you use the 3 bars at the top right of the app screen it will give you an option to quit.  This properly shuts the program down and saves the puzzle your working on.  When this is fix I will give it 5 stars.  Be careful it is so addictive that time just seems to disappear.
0439023521|5.0|Recently, I've read \\"The Hunger Games\\" by Suzanne Collins. Like many others, I've watched the movie before reading the amazing novel, and thought that no book could compare to HD TV.  However, after reading the detailed novel, I've come to realize what an amazing book it truly was. When you first start reading the book's plot will immediately pull you in, and the main character, Katniss Everdeen, makes sure you stay for the bumpy ride. Now, I fully believe that the book can never be compared to the movie because it's so much enhanced in details, and lets the reader's imagination fully take over. I personally would recommend this amazing book to anyone, and will defiantly read the next in its series.  Thought, age wise, I would consider it appropriate to teens above 13 because the book does describe violent scenes and death. The plot takes place in Panem, which is made up of a rich Capital and twelve poorer surrounding districts. The main storyline of this book is that Katniss Everdeen, a 16 year old girl, volunteers to play in the 74th annual Hunger Games. She does this because her younger sister, Prim, is originally chosen and Katniss wants to take her place. Through the story, Katniss must rely on herself to fight, win the hunger games, and come home. This book is defiantly a page turner.
B0086700CM|4.0|It is amazingly fun but can be choppy when doing sharp turns or suddenness movements. It is fun as always, but can be not as fluid as it can be expected to. The game is fun because your goal is you have to run away from gorilla monster. The gorillas are furious at you because you have stolen an idol from a temple. While you are running from the gorillas, you must over-come obsticles and achieve achievements. This is an overall superior game.
0307592731|5.0|\\"Wild\\" is an amazing story.  I didn't want the book to end.  Strayed is a fine writer who told the story of her life which had so many ups and downs.  The long hike on the PCT added much to her growing up and maturing, I think.  She's a gutsie gal who learned to reach out and trust her fellow man.  I have suggested this book to many friends whom I know will enjoy it as much as I did.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love app so much it is a amazing it is awesome my favorite game ever you should try it I would never turn my back on temple run
B005DZMODI|3.0|While I enjoyed this CD, I have other Wynton Marsalis CDs that I like and enjoy much more.  This CD seemed to be disjointed somehow so other musical selections might have been more enjoyable to me.
B0086700CM|5.0|The appstore peeps finally listened! Temple Run is here! I have been waiting since I got my kindle for this! Thank goodness! This is the best game ever! You mist get it!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I just spent the last few days reading this book and was blown away by how good it is, especially for the price.  I wouldn't have given this book a second though if it wasn't for all the prior reviews I read and boy is everyone else right.  There are some minor spelling errors throughout, but for 1.50 you won't find a better book.  Heck this is better than many books I've read where I spend 10-25 dollars on them.  I'm now upset though because it'll be sometime before the second book is finished and I don't want to start another series while I wait; I'd rather continue with this one.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The Wool Omnibus contains all five volumes of the Wool series, originally published as separate novellas.  It's an excellent and engrossing read with wonderful characters and good pacing and tension.
B0086700CM|5.0|so addicting and finally its for the kindle very fun!I recomend this game to everyone people who hate this game are retards. :)
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Just finished Blood Song Book 1 - read the other reviews and take them to heart. If you like this kind of book, you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />I think - good pacing of the tale, excellent characters I wanted to know more about, the hint of a secrets not yet revealed, more than enough action.  Sword and action fantasy straight-up, leaves me wanting more..! NOW!!<br /><br />Worth ten times the price - this guy will be in print soon!
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so much fun. funest game of all the games i have. i enjoy this game .all of my cousin love this game.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Able to switch for right or left hands, nice that you are able to tap a card and auto move it
0670023329|1.0|Written differently this could have been a great story, written as it was; what a waste.<br /><br />The author uses parts of Shin Dong-hyuk's life to tell us about North Korea, and to a lesser extent South Korea.  This is not a story about Shin Dong-hyuk, but it does feature accounts by the author of Shin Dong-hyuk's life.  There is just so much missing.  If you need a primer on life in North Korea and many of the issues there, this book might serve, but let's not make it out to be something it's not.<br /><br />At best it's a poor read, written poorly, about what could have been a facinating story.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Okay, it's hard to like a book, never mind a series, if you don't like the main character-- which I don't. However, I finished the 1st book in one afternoon. Hands down, The Hunger Games was one of my favorite books, for its action, emotional writing, and, of course, Peeta. Catching Fire was okay, but I found myself flipping through it,  waiting for the action to start. Then I found myself in the arena, again, trying to survive, AGAIN. If I wanted another Hunger Games, I would have, oh, I don't know, REREAD The Hunger Games again. I did, however, manage to enjoy the 2nd book much, much better than Mockingjay. It seems everything I loved in the first book was either left out of or twisted in this one. The action was so bland I flipped to the end(Thus Prim's and Finnick's deaths were completely unexpected.) The emotion either was not there, or was so disgustingly terrible that I wanted to puke at Katniss' meanness. I could stand all of this if Collins hadn't turned Peeta from a loving, noble person into a sarcastic maniac. It would have been so much better if he was never taken to the Capitol. However, if Collins had killed off Peeta I probably would have pulled a Nurse Annie from Misery... so it could've gone in a worse direction. All in all, this book was so boring it had me skipping to the end, and what I did read left a bad  taste in my mouth. The only reason I'm giving this book 3 stars is that Peeta didn't die and he returned to his somewhat former self.
B000002UB2|5.0|The Beatles will forever live on.Enough said...<br />Just got it in vinyl today and can't stop listing to it!!!<br />THIS IS A MUST GET!!
B000JQUMPI|4.0|I found this book very &#34;comfortable&#34;. I enjoyed how the author managed to make the book readable to people of all ages even though it was about children. Also, I approved of the theme-- the satisfaction that simple virtues can bring, even if you must sacrifice greater ambition to acheive it. At least, that is the message I took from this book. Additionally, Beth's character and death were beautifully and compellingly written. The one problem I had with the book was the style of narration; it was written in first person with the author referring to herself. This made it hard for me to lose myself in the story, as I kept getting dragged back to reality by the author herself mentioning how the story was a story. This was annoying, to say the least. All in all, I recommend this book, as it becomes even more relevent in today's pleasure-loving mindset, as the characters do their duties wholeheartedly. A good, homelike, virtuous book.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Between the thin and horrible character narratives, elementary writing on a very adult subject, and a forced plot don't waste your time on thus drivel.
B0063B2C5G|5.0|Great show!! It's nice to be able to buy the episodes of this show and every other tv show that I miss.
B0086700CM|5.0|Either way, it is definitely a great time filler.  Although you can buy extra coins with real money, like most of the games these days, they are earned in game fairly quickly so you don't find yourself stuck unless you're willing to fork over real cash.<br /><br />And, since what you spend the coins on are things like power ups (my favorite is the magnet one that helps you collect coins easier) and upgrades (getting to skip 1000 meters ahead or a resurrection one that is one use then needing to be purchased again are a couple examples) the things you buy in game are nice extras as opposed to absolute necessities, so a little patience is all you need.<br /><br />The actual gameplay is straightforward...you are, quite simply, running.  There is no stop or way to slow down and you have to think quickly to turn left or right, jump over obstacles or slide beneath them, and so on.  Oh yeah and try to be on the left, right, or middle part of the path in order to collect the coins as you run by...<br /><br />So simple and yet it keeps eating my time right up...must...run...more.  Must...earn...coins...Need to upgrade powerups further...Need to break my current meters-run record and make it at least to the 3000 meter mark...(what, I'm still getting the hang of it...)
B00664C0PC|5.0|Great show!! It's nice to be able to buy the episodes of this show and every other tv show that I miss.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have really enjoyed playing this game. When I saw that it had finally become available on the kindle fire I was thrilled. Now I play this game almost all the time when I am bored at work.
B002OVEB5S|5.0|I enjoy the entire album as I listen on my Iphone over and over.  All I have on my phone is Slayer so sometimes I shuffle everything and get the full up and down of Slayer which has had very little change since I started listening to Slayer in the 80's.  Slayer is everything to me and I can definatly say that WPB is the third of my favorites with South of Heaven and Seasons in front.  I love that the band has never sold out like M*******ica.  Slayer keeps it real and I'll be thrashing Slayer til I die!  It's like being an Elvis lover, I just keep it all Slayer, I can't listen to anything else.  Nothing compares.<br /><br />As far as WPB, I feel that the hottest song is \\"WPB\\" with \\"Psycopathy in Red\\" next.  Both those two songs are serious mind benders although there are not as much solo and pull off tremello work as with the older songs.  I think Kerry is at a super professional point of his career and doesn't get the support to write with Jeff like before.  I Wasn't too impressed with \\"Big-4\\".  I love to watch the DVD, but only the Slayer part.  I threw away disk two with you know who on it.  I hate lars and James!!!<br /><br />Forever Slayer fan-- WPB will always be on my playlist.

B003IWZ1D8|5.0|5 Stars = Masterpiece<br /><br />The Granddaddy of all insane slasher movies. It also inspired several excellent like themed (called Grand Guignol period) insane horror films of the 60's, which are classic unto their selves! \\"Hush...Hush Sweet Charlotte,\\" & \\"Whatever Happened to Baby Jane.\\" Well worth your time to watch!<br /><br />My mother-in law would never took a shower again, after seeing this film! I myself, when I hear something in the shower, guess what pops in my mind???<br /><br />An incredible film, all the more if you saw it in it's day!
B007UXSPK2|4.0|An entertaining movie. To the level of the second one. The first one was definitely my favorite. Good couch movie
B007C7UZIG|5.0|There really isn't much to this app. It does what the description says. I can see what friends are playing what games, and talk to them. I can also view game catalogs and check sales. Works great.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game reminds me of The Oregon Trail from years ago that we all loved to play!!  This updated version gives the player more tasks to do which is also really nice.
B0086700CM|5.0|the secong u hit play ur addicted till ur device dies then u charge and play freaking amazing!!!!! all I do now when I get home is play till I have something to do
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting for the longest time ever for Temple Run to finally be added. I used to keep on searching and searching for it until one day I searched for it.....AND IT WAS THERE!!! Thank you so much app store owners!!!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I give this book three stars - definitely an engaging and authentic story; but a bit dark for my liking. I do think it was well written though and I do look forward to the remaining books in the series. But first, must finish the Fifty Shades trilogy!
B0086700CM|5.0|I had downloaded this app from one mobile. And it worked but when it was on my caroseul it was fuzzy and I didn't like it.this one works so much better. the other one had glichs and it would freeze up.this one is ALOT better. :)
B0036TGSR6|4.0|By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MS<br /><br />Too many films, these days, rely on special effects, incredible stunts ... forgetting that plot should be one of the most important parts of any movie.<br />Roman Polanski has taken us back to the film noir of the 50s, where though the film moves slowly, The Ghost Writer, moves slowly, it holds the viewer's attention until the final credits roll.<br />The story revolves around the Ghost (Ewan McGregor) who has been hired to complete the memoirs of a former British prime minister, Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan). The manuscript was originally being written by Lang's first choice for ghostwriter. The original author had drowned under mysterious circumstances.<br />It soon becomes apparent that Lang is not as politically driven as his wife, Ruth (Olivia Williams). Our ghostwriter also learns Lang is having an affair with his assistant, Amelia Bly (Kim Cattrall). Bly makes it clear that the original manuscript can never leave the premises.<br />The day our author arrives a former British cabinet minister accuses Lang of authorizing the illegal seizure of suspected terrorists and handing them over for torture by the CIA -- a war crime.<br />Research begins to show that the first ghostwriter did not drown by accident, and that our young reluctant hero may have stumbled into a complex CIA'cover-up, which some will do anything to keep secret.<br />This Summit Entertainment project is a keeper.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|After I heard that Fifty Shades of Gray was inspired by Stephenie Meyer`s Twilight saga, I downloaded the Fifty Shades trilogy.  I enjoyed the Twilight saga but I can`t say the same for the Fifty Shades trilogy.  Fifty Shades was repetitive, unbelievable and very disappointing.

B0063IH60K|4.0|This game works very well and I have really enjoyed it. The card backs are kind of lame and the game options and are kind of hard to find but I figured it out quickly. Over all I would recommend it to anyone and I am very pleased with it.

B007PTJOV0|1.0|if you actually want to play a good nintendo game just get 4 shared download an emulator and zip for games way better idea.
B0086700CM|5.0|I had already downloaded the game from 1mobile.com because I just couldn't wait for it to come out. That version was laggy and it froze a lot.<br /><br />Now all those problems are fixed. The game is actually better to me on the kindle fire than any Apple device. This is an amazing game. My friends have told me that the game is boring because of its age. Temple Run is still one of my favorite games. Now there are definitely things that are better.<br /><br />If you hadden't realized this on other applications, the graphics are always better because of the screen size. This game is no exception. The responsiveness is spot on. The sensitivity can be changed like the ipod ones but to me, the original sensitivity is the best.<br /><br />This game never gets old and everyone should play it.<br />It's the test of your reflexes.<br /><br />Also enjoy other games like Morin test 1&amp;2, gravity guy, spy mouse, angry birds space he, and cut the rope.

0143119680|4.0|Great new series about witches, vampires, and daemons. There are a few things that bother me. At first I thought maybe I had stumbled onto a romance novel with all the \\"non\\" sex scenes. That seemed to resolve itself as the book progressed. Another thing that bothered me is the use of \\"the vampire\\" for someone that Diana Bishop was already in love with. Why not use his name or a pronoun such as \\"he\\". This continues all the way to the end of the book....\\"the vampires\\" or \\"the daemons\\" instead of \\"they\\". Do we say \\"the human\\" or \\"the humans\\"? I was listening to an audio version of this book but I think this would have shouted at me when reading also. After researching the author, I hope that this is just a first time writer's glitch.
B0074MZSWW|3.0|Like a few others here I am also disappointed with the recording of this CD. After listening to this band on YouTube and seeing what they can really sound like. I'm sure this CD will be re-released with better sound quality in the future. Great band though.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I cannot believe this book is so popular.  I honestly don't see any redeeming quality to it.  First, the writing is terrible. Everything is so repetitive,  like the constant inner monologue of Ana's \\"subconscious\\" and \\"inner goddess\\".  The author also uses the same words over and over.  E. L. James needs to invest in a thesaurus.  Most importantly the over all message of the book just pisses me off.  The main character, Ana is so pathetic its not even funny.  It would be one thing if she really was in to the whole dom/sub thing, not something that I would want to do but I don't judge others' sexual preferences, but the girl doesn't even want to do it.  She only agrees because she doesn't want to lose this Mr.  Grey guy.  *spoiler alert*  he makes her call him \\"sir\\" or \\"mr. grey\\",  she has to work out 3-4 times a week (god forbid she get fat), she is required to go to a beauty salon type place to have whatever procedures he decides she needs, etc. As I said, if this were something she was really interested in I'd feel differently but the fact that she isn't and she belittles herself for some man just really strikes a nerve with me.<br /><br />So much for feminism, equal rights, and the hopes that women can be seen as something other than sexual objects.  Thanks a lot Mrs. James for sending us back to 1800's.

0756405890|5.0|Phenomenal book - along w/its successor, and I can't wait for the third.  Second only, IMHO, to George R.R. Martin's Song of Fire and Ice series - and probably more to your liking if you prefer a tighter narrative focusing on only one protagonist (which this is), versus Martin's sprawling (arguably out of control) epic.  Long live Kvothe!

B000SEI230|5.0|The specific Nicolas Sparks book was just slightly different from the others that I have read in the past. One the book had younger characters than he normally has in a book, the characters were in high school. Two most of his books have more 'love storyish' and not just a couple of scenes where they kiss, or go on romantic walks.

0345803485|5.0|I'm a very, happily married woman with two small children. I have zero time to read. A ton of people told me how great this book was but I could not imagine why I would waste my time reading about sex when I can have great sex whenever I want. My husband bought the book and actually read it before me. Only after seeing how much he liked it, I decided to read it, and yes, I am truly happy that I did. I LOVED IT. There is a great love story behind all the sex. I was completely engrossed from page 5 or so. I read this book in four days and read the other two books right after.<br /><br />If you are looking for a literary masterpiece, then maybe this is not the book for you. But, if you want to escape, then definitely, read this book. Also, make sure you have book two before you finish book one, otherwise, you will kick yourself if you don't.
006197806X|2.0|Overall the book is well written, fast paced and interesting but there were things that seriously ruined the whole thing for me...things that made me consider just putting the book down and never picking it back up.    There are things that are hard to swallow that carry over from the first book, such as Lena just assuming that Alex is killed. I don't know about you, but I wouldn't just go \\"Oh man, he will probably get killed. Oh well, I guess he is dead now. Dead, dead, dead. Time to move on.\\" It would be easier to assume if  the author hadn't already brought Lena's mom back from the dead (and what was the point of this, again? Her mother's revival serves no purpose to move the plot forward). And the fact that she falls in love so quickly after losing the love of her life makes it an uncomfortable read.    Though i'd say the romance in this book is set up a little better than the first book (Romeo and Juliet style). Still, the author fails to realize she is asking WAY too much of the reader to care about another one of Lena's 'loves' after watching her first love being ripped from her mere months before...and then proceed to set up the same scenario of us to re-live. I nearly didn't finish this book.    I only read it because I bought it at the same time as Delirium. And while I enjoyed reading this more than I enjoyed Delirium (the pacing and action is far better in this book), the ending left me with no desire to buy the last book.    There is so much potential for this world, I just wish the author didn't hinge the whole series off the idea of a love triangle and random people coming back from the dead. It really frustrates me, considering the potential Lena has as a character and how interesting the world is. I get the appeal of a love triangle...it works in many novels. But in this series it feels forced: it's shoved down our throats like the only possible plot device available in this world.evice available in this world.
B0086700CM|5.0|So happy it finally came out. It is such aa fun game. The ipod ipad and iphone has had it at the app store but now the finally have it here!! Now all we need is Minecraft.

I liked the different twists and turns around the island, and there was a fairly good plot that kept it going.  Every time I thought I was almost done, I would uncover a new room and more levels which was great! I played this on my Kindle Fire.

1402786360|5.0|I have not been able to separate myself from this book since buying it two weeks ago.  Here's why:<br /><br />A Great Reference for Beginners: Many of Heather's recipes are great for beginners.  She includes recipes for simple sugar cookies, homemade fondant, several kinds of icing, and even a list of stencils in the back for those just beginning to play with colored fondant, the painting of food, and the sculpting of icing as a medium.  In many ways the cookbook is advanced too-you'll see lovely macaroons, meticulously hand-painted cookies, and a slew of other jaw-dropping recipes.<br /><br />Visually Inspiring: to say that Heather's baked goods are more like art would be an understatement.  In fact, Heather's baked goods are art.  As the title suggests, her approach to baking takes a cue from her past history as a painter and photographer and inspires readers on how to bring that background to something as everyday as cookies and cakes.  See pages on brush strokes and the different kinds of candy dough to get an idea of just how malleable this baking \\"art\\" form can be.<br /><br />A Primer on Baking Equipment, Art Supplies, and Decorating Tools: Sometimes, it can be hard to imagine just how Heather gets such amazing results for her blog.  With the opening pages of the Sprinkle Bakes Cookbook, you get a sense for what works and what doesn't.  As I'm always advocating the use of a silpat in my own kitchen, it's fun to see that Heather uses parchment paper for her work instead.  Plus, I can take advice from Heather's other tools like Rolling-Pin Guide Bands or Piping Tip Brushes.

B007L96SI6|5.0|Most of the C.D.'s I've purchased from Idol's I liked were unimpressive-they play it too safe and don't keep the unique tones in their voice. At first, I thought Haley's uncontrollable rasp was missing a little, and I could go for a little more of it-but this was still great, and unlike other idols, this C.D. really did sound like HER. It's really cool that she co-wrote most of the songs, and they really do seem her style. They make me feel like I've gone back in time, but in a modern way. Haley Reinhart, to me, is a very unique breath of fresh air, America has been waiting for her. I love ALL of the songs on this album, it's been on in my car the entire time since the release date. Wish there were more songs on it, I hope she's recording another album!!!
1451629184|5.0|The book is the most difficult piece of literature that I have ever read. I am glad that Jaycee didn't have a ghost-writer help her write this book. Jaycee tells her story in a very raw way which makes the story even that much more captivating. I can sum up my reaction to reading this book in 4 simple statements:<br />I cried<br />I cussed<br />I questioned God, and in the end<br />I smiled.<br /><br />The monsters that carried out such evil upon Jaycee and her daughters took things from them that can never be regained. At the same time though, Jaycee is in many ways miraculously redeeming the life that was stolen for a time.<br /><br />Jaycee Dugard is an inspiration to me. She will be to all who read her story.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Enjoyable read. All things considered, it was a good way to end the series. Be sure to read the first two books in the Hunger Games series as this book would not be anywhere near as good as a stand-alone.
0439023521|3.0|The Hunger Games is a story about a young and intelligent 16 year-old girl fighting for survival in a fitictional, post-apocolyptic, deathmatch arena. The read is entertaining and I'll offer both criticism and praise.<br /><br />Criticism:<br /><br />Collins' prose is entirely unformidable and perspicuous. Advanced readers will find nothing cryptic, intriguing, or provocative after chapter one. The characters are simple caricatures of people we all know. They're predictable, often naïve, and sometimes frustrating. The dialogue - both internal and external - is both shallow and bland. The metaphors are sophomore and sparse. The story is unoriginal, as it is merely a twist on Battle Royal with a bit of history, background, and minimal character development.<br /><br />Praise:<br /><br />Collins' virtue is in story-stelling. Very little happens over the course of the book, but the read is entertaining. The pages turn well and the chapters develop gradually with build-up, climax, and conclusion. Collins' experience in writing children's television programming is evident and the end result is a simple, approachable, and youthful adventure (with a tinge of violence).<br /><br />The Skinny:<br /><br />If you're into light, adventure reading (i.e., Harry Potter) you'll probably enjoy this book. The book is effectively entertaining. If you're looking for something with rich prose, creative story, or political/cultural/philosophical undercurrent, keep looking.

B005MYEPXC|5.0|Loved the movie, bought the blu-ray and found the disc is defective, no audio track.  Music track yes, dialogue track, no.  Sony should have an exchange program for this, apparently not.  I'm returning this and ordering a regular disc.  The movie is sweet, well scripted and otherwise magical Woody Allen.
0061537969|5.0|This is by far the best book that I have ever read. I never do product reviews, but this book was so great that I needed to give my impute.<br /><br />The novel hooks you from the first page and will never let you put it down. The author manages to attach you to the character in the story better than in book I remember reading. This is a novel that I believe that everyone should pick up and read.<br /><br />On top of that I love racing so this book was a perfect fit for me.

B0072440OE|4.0|When Norah Jones arrived in early 2002, not much was known about her. In fact, the only things that people knew about her were her father being Ravi Shankar and being the newest signee to the  Blue Note record label. She released her debut album \\"Come Away With Me\\", which was produced legendary hitmaker Arif Mardin (The Bee Gees, Average White Band, Scritti Politti, Chaka Kahn). Her single \\"Don't Know Why\\" was an instant smash and she followed it up by working with Mardin again for her second album \\"Feels Like Home\\". Her sophomore effort had traces of country music alongside her jazz influences- only this time around, her album was all original material. Sadly, it would be the last time Norah and Mardin would work together- as he would pass away from cancer several months before the release of her next album. On her 2007 album \\"Not Too Late\\", she turned to a member of her band Lee Alexander (Best known for producing Amos Lee's self titled debut) for the production. She went with a soul based sound and followed it up with her fourth release- the Jacquire King produced \\"The Fall\\" in 2009.<br /><br />For the next few years Norah laid low until May 2012, when she issued her fifth recording \\"Little Broken Hearts\\". On this new album, the enlists the production of Gnarls Barkley member/producer Danger Mouse (Gorillaz, The Black Keys, Beck). While Norah's previous works bore the obvious stamp of the 'Norah Jones sound', \\"Little Broken Hearts\\" sounds less like a Norah Jones record and more like a Danger Mouse record. Look no further than the song \\"Say Goodbye\\" a song in which Norah walks away from a relationship when she's forced to be honest. On the ballad \\"She's 22\\", she's trapped in a love triangle with someone who also has a much younger girlfriend. Norah gets help from the Sonus Quartet on the songs \\"Take It Back\\", the dark confrontation ballad \\"Miriam\\" and the album closer \\"All A Dream\\". She tries to recover from heartbreak on the upbeat \\"Happy Pills\\" and desires to escape on the country flavored \\"Out On The Road\\". Norah Jones' \\"Little Broken Hearts\\" is a noticeable change in sound for the singer-songwriter. It's not her best work, but it's a daring record for her to step out of her comfort zone. While the pairing of Norah and Danger Mouse sounded odd on paper, it surprisingly works on this new album.cape on the country flavored \\"Out On The Road\\".

0307592731|5.0|Cheryl Strayed found herself at the age of 26, out of parents, out of her marriage, leaning on drugs and headed in a direction she realized was not healthy. So, she took a walk. The chance finding of a book describing how to hike the Pacific Crest Trail led her to accept that physical challenge as a way coming to grips with a life that seemed to be slowly spinning out of control.<br /><br />Along her 1100 mile journey she tells us the story of how she got to the point in her life where going alone on a long hike seemed like a good idea. She encounters bears, rattlesnakes, snakes of a human sort and even some \\"Trail Angels\\".<br /><br />As she walks with aching muscles and battered feet, the epiphany she seemed to be looking for doesn't come.  Instead she learns that the only thing worth worrying about for NOW is taking the next step.<br /><br />She came to this trek seemingly unprepared but little by little she learns that sometimes Mom does know best. Sometimes the lessons we learn from our parents, although seemingly irrelevant at the time, may just be the right preparation for life in the real world.<br /><br />WARNING! When you finish this book you will want to do what Cheryl did. Instead, look for your own challenge be it the same kind of long walk or learning to do something you never thought you could.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this highly enough! Especially if you know a young person needing a little help in direction finding.

I bought the original shuttle released because this is one of my favorite vehicles from star wars, and when I saw this, I was absolutely in awe, and more in awe once I build the vehicle. It is HUGE!!! Incredible detail. I didn't buy this from amazon though, I bought it on Star Wars day from Lego with their special promotion, but I think it's well worth the money for any serious collector. Be advised, this thing is HUGE and takes up some room, so move those crappy figures over, and put this mammoth in their place, it will fill the space with the glory of the EMPIRE!

B007H9B8FS|3.0|Garbage is one of my favorite bands from the past twenty years. In the late 90s I listened to their first two albums non-stop. Catchy, melodic, danceable yet rocking, both the self-titled debut (1995) and the more up-tempo follow-up \\"Version 2.0\\" are modern classics.  \\"Queer,\\" \\"Only Happy When it Rains,\\" \\"Stupid Girl,\\" \\"Vow,\\" \\"Special,\\" \\"Medication,\\" etc. are some of the best alt. rock songs of all-time.<br /><br />Not wanting to rehash the same formula, Garbage expanded their sound, incorporating elements of electronica and dance-pop for their third album \\"Beautiful Garbage\\" (2001) and went for a more rocking sound with its' follow-up \\"Bleed Like Me\\" (2005).<br /><br />One thing that I liked and admired about this band was their willingness to take chances. Each of their four albums had its own personality. Even if the first two were the most similar, each one still had its own flavor. I was very pleased to read that Garbage were working on a new album and wondered what direction they would take. Unfortunately, they didn't really take one with \\"Not Your Kind of People\\" (2012).<br /><br />I want to be clear about one thing, this is NOT a bad album. It's actually quite good. Butch Vig, Duke Erikson, Steve Marker and Shirley Manson still know how to churn-out finely written, well-crafted songs and every track on this album is good. Shirley Manson remains an exciting, charismatic frontwoman and her words and voice still captivate. The problem is that Garbage are playing it safe and except for some modern touches here and there, are in their comfort zone, making an album in the vein of their first two albums. While some of the songs like \\"Automatic Systematic Habit\\" and \\"Blood for Poppies\\" have a modern, almost Lady Ga Ga feel, this album sounds pretty retro. It could have been released anytime between 1996-1999 and it would have probably sold a few million copies. The album is at times very exciting and when it's good, it's very good, but even so, it seems like it has a \\"been there, done that\\" kind of feel. One exception is the very cool \\"Control,\\" which has an almost Clint Eastwood, \\"Man With No Name\\" Western feel.<br /><br />If you are a Garbage fan, buy this album. You'll enjoy it. But if you are new to Garbage, start off with the first two or the greatest hits and then maybe check this out. Also, make sure to order the deluxe edition (red cover) as it has four bonus songs and is only a few more dollars. The bonus songs are good, but sort of by-the-numbers.a \\"been there, done that\\" kind of feel.

B005LAIIRQ|3.0|This Liam Neeson vehicle has been marketed as a spirited action movie.  While there is action and suspense, the tone of the film is different than advertised.  It is a morose, nihilistic death march through the Alaskan wilderness.  There never is a \\"Rocky\\" moment in which the crash survivors turn the tables on the wolfpack.  They are simply there in order to suffer and die.  The pacing is off, with morbid moments that seem to drag on forever.<br /><br />In all of these \\"Ten Little Indians\\" type of scenarios, the characters must be sympathetic and well-developed, their deaths plausible, in order for the viewer to feel that he has not been crassly manipulated.  By that standard, this film is not especially well-written.  There may be too many \\"Aw, come on!\\" moments for viewers.  The Alaskan plane crash premise, along with the battle against an obsessed carnivore, draws comparisons with the old Anthony Hopkins vehicle \\"The Edge.\\"  \\"The Edge,\\" however, is practically sunny and optimistic compared with this film.<br /><br />In a way, it is refreshing that the film avoids most attempts at saccharine sentimentality; morover, it flatly rejects spriritual or metaphysical consolations.  If there is any universality to this film, it is the theme that, given that we are all doomed, what induces us to fight our end?  Here, there are no happy answers.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is EPIC!! It is very addicting after you understand the simple controls. I hope you agree with me!! Believe me, this the game thar combines simplictiy and fun.

B005KJJ4F8|5.0|Such a wonderful twist on the Cinderella story! Cinder is gutsy, humble and down-to-earth - she's flawed but so willing to put herself out there. She's someone I'd love to call a friend... and that's not something I usually say about a character.<br /><br />The end of the story gave a number of relevations, so it wasn't completely a cliffhanger. I want to know what happens to Cinder and her world, but mostly I just want to read more about her.
B0086700CM|5.0|fun and addicting, great buy for kindle fire....I'm glad its finally been added. its my favorite game at the moment.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Hello. You won't be getting the season 7 until oct 9th. You must have purchased the pre order. So u will get it asap once season 7 is released
B003P2WO5E|4.0|I'm excited for the second book as the first book is never even close to the best and this was a very good book.  I consider it somewhat of a mix of George R.R. Martin's books (not as depressing) and Jordan's books.  Definitely worth a read.

1934356476|5.0|This was a great book.  I learned a ton, and the examples and reading was never tedious or repeated.  It's a pretty quick read too (each time, might want to pass through it more than once).  There isn't much required coding to do along the way, but that's completely up to you.  I kept an interactive ruby shell open to really drive the points home.
B006OV7S1I|4.0|MOVIE RATING:  4 stars (B+)<br /><br />One of the most surprising and intriguing films I saw in 2011 was director Sean Durkin's debut feature film, Martha Marcy May Marlene (2011). In fact, it was one of my Top 10 Movies of 2011. I know, I know...the title is long and confusing to remember. But after seeing the movie, it becomes a lot more memorable. That's because you WANT to remember it so you can share it with your friends. This is a film that's really hard to talk about in terms of its story and plot. You've really just have to watch it and feel it and let it get into your head and move around. The less you know, the better. So I won't spoil it by trying to talking about it in those terms.<br /><br />As both writer and director of M4 (my shorthand abbreviation), Durkin has shown everyone the craft and care that's possible from an independent filmmaker with a low production budget (under $1 Million), but a great story to tell and the passion to tell it. The real key to the success of M4 is in the excellent performances of the cast, led by newcomer Elizabeth Olsen, the relatively unknown third sister of the Olsen Twins. Olsen embodies the psychologically troubled character of Martha with chilling emotional depth. She seems to have REALLY gotten into the head of Martha, which is not the best place to be, and brought everything within her to the surface for us to feel and experience in a dreamlike manner. And with a solid supporting cast of character actors that includes John Hawkes, Hugh Dancy, Sarah Paulson, and Brady Corbet, the world of an un-named rural Northeast cult is brought to eerily rich life.<br /><br />M4 is a smart, mysterious, and confusing psychological drama. While Durkin has written a story that keeps you guessing, it also keeps you an arm's length away from understanding some of it's details, which is both good and bad. Overall, I think it's well-written and engaging, but there were times during the film where I had to simply let go of figuring something out at the moment and just follow along in a murky mist. If there is one major weakness in M4, I think it is in some of the seemingly abstract aspects of the story. But that may also be what makes the movie stand out from the crowd too. Only time will tell. I need to watch the film again to really talk more about it's themes and ideas.<br /><br />The visuals in M4 have a dark, gritty, and grainy feel, having been shot on 35mm film in what I assume was mostly natural light. And there is an incredible beauty in the shadows and gritty gray areas of the frame. I love crisp, clear and detailed digital cinematography, but 35mm film really worked well in telling this story. Cinematographer Jody Lee Lipes completely captured the perfect visuals here. I was constantly engaged in appreciating the compositions of each and every sequence, admiring the craftsmanship of the team behind the camera.<br /><br />Probably the most striking filmmaking aspect of M4 is the editing. Lead Film Editor Zachary Stuart-Pontier gave us one of the most finely edited films of 2011. The transitions between the present and the past, memory and reality, are seamless and a wonder to watch. The flow and feel of the film really came together in the editing room and took this good story with its great visuals and performances and made it something more. I'm guessing that the editing team spent A LOT of time in Post putting this film together. And it truly paid off.<br /><br />Hand in hand with the editing is really stellar sound work by the sound team. The moments of quiet, the moments of just sound, the music...they all come together like they should in a psychological film like this. Again, I was continually impressed as I was watching this movie at how the editing of the visuals, together with the sound, really told this story right. Not much else to say. While the production design is simple and understated, I definitely felt transported into the rural Northeast location. The farm, the lakehouse, and everything in between just works. Chad Keith and his team did a great job of creating the physical world of M4 and bringing all the pieces together.<br /><br />2011 was a strong year for small, independent films. And Martha Marcy May Marlene is at the top of the list of those movies. It's the perfect film to check out on Blu-ray or DVD some Saturday afternoon or evening when you want to escape into the mind of a mystery.house, and everything in between just works.

B004LROUW2|2.0|I read it, I read it,I kept reading it, I kept reading... I am so glad it's done. Why did I keep on reading, hope that the ending would be worth it. It wasn't. Interesting plot that never really gets resolved to my satisfaction and I think could be done so much better.
B0086700CM|5.0|one of the best games ever. really fun to play and coins just wish had more awards to buy. enjoyable

B007JM4CWY|4.0|it takes a little thinking, but not so much as to be frustrating.  The controls can be a hassle, but just expand the screen and scroll around.  I really like this game.
B002SJIO4A|5.0|I put this one into roughly the same category as a Cohen Bros. flick.  It ain't pretty, with babes running around in skimpy tees as a lot of the sci-fi genre would lead us to believe happens in the future.  It's down to earth, realistic projections of what could happen should a technologically advanced race lose their way and encounter the plundering, greedy humans.<br />It also has some of the alien shoot-em-up scenes in it with good effects, but not too much, in my opinion.<br />I saw this 4 times in 09 on flights to/from Brazil in '10 and can't wait to get my copy to watch it again.<br />It's one of those movies that you need to watch several times to get the nuances.  I can understand how if you just went to the theater and never watched it again, you'd miss a lot.<br />It ranks right up there with O Brother for me.<br />Give it a shot, I think you'll like it.
B0041CGP02|5.0|I was so thrilled when I heard about this CD and love it even more that it has all my favorite songs on it. I had lost some Cd's over the years and have been trying to replace them. So I was happy to see this collection because with this one I could get pretty much all the songs I'd want from all Bon Jovi's music. I may buy the other albums just to have the songs that didn't make this collection but atleast I have a good enough sampling that I'm satisfied.

B005LAIGTG|1.0|I had read a lot of bad stuff about this flick.  The only reason I watched it was because Jessica Lange dropped in and saved the day as only she can do.    What's-his-name and The Notebook girl were good, to be honest.  Seriously, though...the fart scene?  That's just plain laughable, out of place, and ridiculous.  I'm not a prude by any means...but that was just nasty.  Ruined the moment.  RUINED it.

B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved it, and I couldn't put it down! I also bought the next one in the series, but the third one is not as well written. Yet, I had to finish it and can say I am glad I did, the ending was worth finishing it.
B00845MRKE|4.0|From the description of the set, it sounds like this was the version that was released a few years back when it was the five-disc DVD Voight-Kampff Gift Set that came in the mini-suitcase, but sadly it turns out that it's not. At least it has the little Matchbox-style Spinner included.<br /><br />If you're a die-hard fan of BLADE RUNNER and really want the best picture/sound quality that is currently available, this might not be a bad price, since I'm sure that previous Blu-Ray sets of this are selling for a lot more with it being out of print. If not, then this is pretty easily skippable. The 5-Disc set has a glut of bonus features and four different versions of the film: The \\"Final\\" cut, the 1992 Director's Cut, the 1982 Theatrical Cut, and an early cut of the theatrical release. The fifth disc is an amazing 3-and-a-half hour behind-the-scenes documentary called \\"Dangerous Days\\" (a reference to the original working title for the film as scripted by Hampton Fancher) which is LOADED with interesting tidbits and anecdotes about the making of the film as well as long studies of its conceptual art to its continuing influence on Sci-Fi and neo-noir genres. Having watched only the Final cut (to see what significant changes were made from the '92 Director's cut, and there aren't many) and the Theatrical cut (because there are moments in the Theatrical cut that are really interesting as well) and the documentary, there's a lot to digest and again, is only for really hardcore fans of this film.<br /><br />I know that everybody HATES UltraViolet because of the issues they have with streaming the film on the various devices it's supposed to support, but that's so much of a non-issue because it's almost not even worth it to see it on a smaller screen than a television and someday, manufacturers will start getting the hint and just continue to provide digital copies, because those work quite well.<br /><br />Of course as far as the film is concerned, it's beyond classic status, and well-deserved of its vast acclaim. However, the \\"Final\\" cut is not extraordinarliy different, aside from some digital clean-up, some insertions of some shots from the workprint version, some shots that clean up some editing inconsitencies, and some lines of dialogue that clear up some logical inconsistencies. The most obvious difference is the digital superimposition of Joanna Cassidy's face over her very different-looking stunt-double during the Deckard-Zhora shootout sequence, which has long been a source of bother for fans.<br /><br />Personally, I loved both the Theatrical Cut and the Director's cut, warts and all, so all of the Final cut changes are nice, but don't make a significant difference in the enjoyment of the film. At least Ridley Scott didn't go all Lucas on the film and start inserting scenes that make no sense and actually hurt the film more than help it (See the \\"Special Editions\\" of the original STAR WARS trilogy if you don't know what I mean).and well-deserved of its vast acclaim.

B0086700CM|5.0|at last they bring us temple run on the kindle fire. I hope it has good motion and good graphics
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|This was one of the best books I have read in a long time. As the reader you never know who the killer is, even from the beginning. A boy's mother dies, but you never find out his name and Harry Hole is on a mission to find the killer, this takes him hither and thither and straps him with a new, dubiously-motivated partner who globs on to him. Since I read this book first, I was unaware of the entirety of the Harry Hole series. But he's a great character. A character you can actually care about.<br /><br />I love how Nesbo incorporates Hole's flat and the mold into the book, how it is part of his life. His life is the seamless transition between ex-girlfriend, work, new \\"partner,\\" and his moldy flat; along with a killer that is on the lose and he can't seem to find him. These poor women disappear, children are left traumatized, but Hole plugs along, trying to stay clear of alcohol, sometimes failing, but ultimately ending up the hero at the end of the book. This was the end of the series and Nesbo closed it in an excellent manner.<br /><br />This is an a must read, an absolutely spell-binding, well-written book. @derkrautboy loved it as well!

0307716546|5.0|I don't know how to discuss this book, because it defies categorization.<br /><br />On the one hand, and at its most basic, it is a mystery. Grace runs into a burning school building to rescue her daughter Jenny, who is trapped inside. As Grace and Jenny recover from their wounds, Grace learns that the fire was arson, and she sets out to discover who is to blame.<br /><br />But this book is so much more.<br /><br />It is the story of parents. Grace and her husband, Michael, have 17-year-old Jenny and 8-year-old Adam. In fact, the day of the fire also happens to be Adam's birthday. They do not always agree on parenting their children; Michael, a traveling television journalist, distrusts Adam's beloved teacher, while Grace wishes Michael distrusted Jenny's boyfriend a little more. But we know they love each other. Theirs is not a marriage that is in trouble, yet it is a marriage. It has its skips and bumps.<br /><br />Afterwards is also the story of a mother and a daughter. As Grace delves deeper into the mystery surrounding the fire, she both grows closer to and realizes the distance between Jenny and herself. She is unhappy with Jenny's apparent lack of academic discipline, and she thinks Jenny is in too deep with her boyfriend. She also struggles with jealousy of her sister-in-law, Sarah, a policewoman with whom Jenny shares confidences. Grace exhibits typical parental insecurity in that regard.<br /><br />This is the story of a family. Grace feels inferior to Sarah, and she feels judged by her. Yet she comes to discover a different side to her sister-in-law, as she watches Sarah both investigate the fire and comfort her brother, Michael, as he tries to manage his daughter's and wife's injuries. Grace desperately tries to help Sarah, especially when Grace fears that Jenny's life is in danger. Grace feels powerless to help her daughter, and she must rely on Sarah to help her find the arsonist.<br /><br />And this is also the story of friendship. Grace's friend, Maisie, has a daughter Jenny's age who also was in the fire. Rowena is not as injured as Jenny, but Grace knows Maisie is worried about her, nonetheless. But the further Grace moves through the investigation, the more she learns about Maisie, her daughter, and even Maisie's husband. Grace begins to wonder just how much she knows about her purported best friend.<br /><br />Afterwards will make you think. You will get caught up in the mystery as Grace and Sarah pursue all of the angles. Who set fire to the school? Why? Is Adam's favorite teacher evil or misunderstood. And what about Maisie's husband? Then there is Adam himself. Did he play a role? But it is more than that. You will find yourself examining your own relationships with your children and friends. How much do we really know about our families and loved ones?<br /><br />This is a completely absorbing book, and I enjoyed every word. I admit that I feel for a bad red herring, and I didn't see the arsonist coming. I did have some suspicions about the mastermind, though, but even then, I can't say I really thought that person was guilty.<br /><br />Rosamund Lupton is to be commended for writing this novel, because it is so richly complex and fulfilling. But beware: you will not be able to put it down once you start, so choose your time wisely.<br /><br />Published on cupcake's book cupboard. @VivaAmaRisata<br />ARC from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.sie, has a daughter Jenny's age who also was in the fire.

B004QOB8SY|5.0|\\"Sherlock\\" is one of the best shows on television right now. If you aren't watching it, you really should be. Season 2 definitely lived up to expectations. I think the very first episode, \\"A Scandal in Belgravia,\\" is hands-down the best episode of the season to date. The third episode of the season, \\"The Reichenbach Fall,\\" leaves you with an awesome cliffhanger, one that I am dying to see how they handle next season. Surprisingly, my least favorite episode of this season was \\"The Hounds of Baskerville.\\" It was an interesting episode, but as it is one of my favorite classic Sherlock Holmes tales, I think I really had a lot of expectations for this episode, and was slightly disappointed by the way it ultimately played out. I am still giving the season five stars, though, because it is just THAT GOOD. See for yourself if you haven't already done so!!!

B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Pretty good game. No bugs or problems yet. Pretty easy to move through and you don't get stuck in the beginning stages like in some games.<br /><br />The above was my original review. After playing for a while... I'm not so positive. I saw where another reviewer said they would like to rate either 5 stars or no stars. This describes my feelings perfectly! There are so many incredibly frustrating glitches that just don't get updated. Without these it could potentially be a fun and addicting game. As things stand, all it does is make you want to throw your Kindle across the room.

159514188X|5.0|Imagine you're a teenager living your life as usual when one of your peers commits suicide. Even worse, imagine you are one of the reasons she ended her life. That is just the case for Clay Jensen in Jay Asher's Thirteen Reasons Why. Every school in the nation struggles with bully in one form or another, simply because kids and teens do not know the damage they are causing.<br /><br />Clay Jensen receives an odd package with his name written on it. Being young, getting mail was a rare, exciting experience. He hastily opened it to see what was encased in the brown wrapping. Inside, he found seven cassette tapes. He hurried to the garage to listen to the first tape. Little does he know he will regret ever opening that little package.<br /><br />\\"I hope you're ready, because I'm about to tell you the story of my life. More specifically, why my life ended. And if you are listening to these tapes, you're one of the reasons why.\\"<br /><br />As he listens, he is surprised to hear no other than Hannah Baker. He might not have been as surprised if she hadn't of committed suicide two weeks earlier. Hannah Baker was Clays high school crush and her death was a tragedy for him.<br /><br />Through these tapes, Hannah is telling her story. Her reasons. Clay soon starts to notice everything she was going through. The only problem with knowing is he can't do anything to fix what had already happened. Hannah sends him on the most emotional walk around town just trying to help him understand why. With every tape he listens to, I began to lose touch with the 'outside world' and lost track of time completely along with Clay on his emotional journey.<br /><br />Jay Asher had a tough scenario to convey through text. Asher needed to show Clay talking to people, thinking to himself, showing his feelings, and had to do this for Hannah over tapes. Somehow he managed to do all of this while still making the story interesting and not losing the reader to confusion. Through his headings and a difference in fonts, I enjoyed both aspects of the books; Hannah's tapes and Clay's analysis of them.<br /><br />Thirteen Reasons Why taught me a lesson, and kept me busy with the great story. I would recommend this book to all readers 12+ because any younger than that and they might not get the full message Asher had worked so hard to portray in the dark yet interesting story of Hannah's suicide. Teens need to be aware of the effects of bullying therefore, they need to read this fantastic book. Every school in the nation struggles with bullying in one form or another, simply because kids and teens do not know the damage they are causing. Thirteen Reasons Why helps kids understand what not to do while they read a classic page turner.
B0086700CM|5.0|Some people think, that a game is bad by the review, but I played games that have 3 stars and a lot of 2 star reviews, but that was a really good game and I liked it. You have to remember, the reveiws are people's own options and the game might be different too. So don't hold back on a game till you played it and not go off of what other people say. People all have different interests in what they do and think, ain't there a game that u loved that had some bad reviews. Most of the bad reviews are some thing wrong with what phone, tablet, ipod and so on, but it might be the device you are using not the game. Also there's bad reviews about that people are not interested in that kind of game but think, have u played it yet. I liked this game ever sence I found it on my ipod touch, and you should love it to. Remember, don't let people control what you do and think. Live your life the way you want to.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is a great game keep running my battery down playing it so much anyone that gets it will love it! and it is free

B006IGZWB2|1.0|The Help was incredibly predictable and consequently boring.  Most importantly The Help made light of very serious subjects and seemed more like  dark comedy than drama.  The main character's boyfriend was completely unbelievable in his mood swings.  At dinner he is an arrogant alcoholic.  Upon visiting her home he is a supportive, apologetic man.  Upon news of the publication, he becomes an enraged man who leaves in a fury!  His character was completely unbelievable.  The actresses were great, but other than their skilled acting, I feel I wasted a couple of hours and was embarrassed that I selected the movie for viewing.
B0086700CM|3.0|I like this game a lot its just the dude doesn't do what I say. if I tell him to jump he just keeps running straight half the time its frustrating
145162445X|5.0|This is truly a captivating and informative book. I went into it with little to no knowledge of the wondrous Universe we call home. This book informed me in a comprehensive, and well written manner and i recommend it to friends and family constantly. Well worth the read! I am now an avid reader of similar titles.
0380725398|4.0|Actually a 3.75 for me. I wasn't completely enchanted with the goings on of Jamaica Inn.<br /><br />Although this was not Ms. Du Marnier's most famous work it should not be over looked.  It has held up surprisingly well for a story written in 1936. By today's standards it is wordy and over-descriptive leaving the readers mind to wander.  It was a also bit jarring to keep seeing the characters first and surnames being utilized. It was another minor note that became annoying as it went on. Again differences in acceptable writing styles have occurred since this book was written.<br /><br />Regarding the story itself, the synopsis is designed to not provide a lot of information about what the story holds and I actually liked that - it added to the mystery of the piece. The pacing of the plot was designed to increase the tension of the moment and it did - very well. The characters were drawn vividly enough so they had definable personalities and possibly my modern brain kept bumping into the stupidity of some character actions - they were quite visual. Some of these characters could actually serve as the prototype for famous clichés such as the drunken landlord, the albino priest, the drab & fearful wife, the boggy moor. This is a multi-layered story covering quite a few dark crimes people commit that fans of historical literature shouldn't miss.
B0086700CM|5.0|it is my fav game ever i could play this for my whole life and its a addicticting for freee i was waiting so long for this game to come out and now it did
B0086700CM|5.0|It's nothing more than running and dodging (by jumping and ducking over/under obstacles) mean monkeys but what sets this game apart is that it's different every time you play it. It's a great FUN and FREE program. What more could one ask for? Except maybe some free power-ups along the run for your life.

0345803493|4.0|I absolutely loved the first book and thought the second and the third where not necessary. It becomes too much of a repetition after a while. I think the whole story could have been written in one book instead of three.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I m reading it and I makes it so much easyer to. read Cu's it is so much bigger. omg. I love this it tells so much about God and how earth got to be like this . to be love and how he intended us to use this land he gave us to live on with air and every thing he gave so we can be a live and healthy.<br />if there was nothing to do and the only thing that u had was a Bible and the hunger games I would.Pick the Bible.

0399246665|5.0|I purchased these books for my nephew. He isn't old enough yet to appreciate them but hopefully when he is he will love them. These books are full of bright colors and easy to read font. The hard covers are especially good considering the age group they're intended for. They were shipped well within the given dates and arrived inperfect condition. I highly reccommend this book set.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book kept me reading until all hours of the night. I could not put this book down. It makes you more aware of your behavior and the behavior of your children
B007MAETA8|4.0|Maybe it's because John Mayer and I are around the same age but it seems that everything he puts out just speaks to me.  Battle Studies, I thought, was just great music with a pop twist.  This album reminds me of the kind of music my parents used to listen to when I was growing up and it resonates with me.  I really wish John Mayer fans would take their heads out of their asses and realize that an artist cannot stick with the same formula over and over (ie: Continuum).  It wont work and is counter productive to their own art to do so.  Born and Raised is a beautiful album with beautiful melodies and most importantly a beautiful message. I kind of feel sorry for John Mayer to have such whiney babies as fans.
0553801473|5.0|So, I was most annoyed about Martin's decision to divide his characters between two books separated as they were by geographic distance.<br /><br />In part my annoyance may have been due to not really liking the southern characters, and at the time I did not realise there would be a payoff - the next book Dance with Dragons would be ALL  about the characters I did like!<br /><br />Well for the most part, Martin still manages to meander around with characters I barely heard of let-alone care about, and for some the plot will still appear to be moving at snails pace.<br /><br />Still D w/ Ds rules. Martin's writing is crisp, and powerful seeming to have evolved over the sixish years he took to write this book. Obviously if you've read up to this one in the series you're probably going to read this anyway, I'm just providing a heads up this is a goodun...
0345803485|3.0|The sex scenes are pretty good. I just got annoyed with the whole \\"continuous traits\\" thing. Like she bites her lip and blushes 15 million times, and he cocks his head another 20 million times. The book is good. A little unbelievable, but if you're like every other woman out there, you want to believe that fantasies like this really do happen. It gives you hope.<br />This book is either going to cause some serious pregnancies with wives jumping on their husbands, or many divorces when they don't put out.<br />Give it ago.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this app since they didn't have it before i download the app on 4shared but I erased it when I found out this was on the fire I love the game

1423113462|4.0|We're going to change things up a bit and today and I'm going to review some middle grade fiction. I'm usually not a huge fan of the middle grade genre, but for Rick Riordan, I'll read anything. It seems that Riordan has delved into my elementary-aged self and pulled all of my past loves into his books. What child in 4th grade didn't love learning about Greek, Roman and Egyptian mythology? If these things were your favorites as well, check out Mr. Riordan's books because they will definitely take you back.<br /><br />While I have already read his first series, Percy Jackson and the Olympians, (and I'm quite obsessed) I have read and re-read those books so many times I think later I'll do a big review of the series as a whole. The Lost Hero takes off a little after the last of the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series stopped, only now we find out that Percy is missing. His girlfriend, Annabeth, is ready to tear the world apart to find him and she thinks Hera, the goddess who seems to hate demigods (especially Annabeth) is behind his disappearance. We are introduced to new demigods and one of them, Jason, has lost his memory and has no idea where he came from. This book takes readers on a whirlwind adventure through quests to find family, friends and answers to some of the worlds oldest questions.<br /><br />I really did like this book. While not quite as much as the Percy Jackson and the Olympians books, this one really was great. We meet a host of new Gods and Goddesses and we're even introduced to their Roman counterparts. The thing I like most about Riordan's books is that they have a sneaky way of teaching you not only important lessons, but also about mythology. I will swear this to you, some of the only reasons I passed my college Classics class was the fact that I had read Riordan's books. How else would I have known what each God and Goddess represented? Or what their Roman counterparts were named? Or that Aphrodite, while married to Hephaestus, had some pretty sordid affairs with Ares. These books only strengthened my love of mythology and I know that they're ones that I will one day read to my children. They're that great.<br /><br />Rick does a superb job of world building. I'm sure it's just as exciting for kids to believe that Olympus is now located at the Empire State Building and that the Underworld is in L.A. These books really put your imagination into overdrive and you have to wonder where Rick gets his wonderfully brilliant ideas.<br /><br />I do recommend starting out with the first series, beginning with The Lightening Thief as they are prequels to this series and you may be a tad confused with the characters and their parentage. Also, if you're a fan of Egyptian mythology, definitely check out The Kane Chronicles, another series by Rick Riordan that have the same quirky and fun way of sneaking some learning in while you read.<br /><br />6 out of 10 (Only because I do love the Percy and the Olympians better)<br /><br />Happy Reading :)<br /><br />-Allison<br />[...]irs with Ares.

B0077PBPJ6|5.0|I just watched this movie out of bordom and it turned out to be great. All the acting was sensational. I loved the quiet, touching moments between them. Not to mention the beautiful soundtrack. The main male actor has a great future of acting. My heart ached for him.

1594202842|4.0|Amy Chua's \\"Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother\\" was more irritating to read than dropping a pencil, trying to pick it up, to only end up kicking it even farther away.  This doesn't just happen once.  It happens over and over again until you frustrate yourself to the point of verbal or physical outbursts.  By then you were finally able to pick up the pencil that was dropped.  Relief sets upon you and you continue on your way.  I felt that same kind of relief when I finished Amy Chua's book.  While I was able to take breaks from reading the book every once in a while I kicked my metaphorical pencil until I was finally able to pick it up.<br /><br />According to the front cover (forgive me if this was not written by Chua herself) her first intention in writing this book was to show that the Chinese parenting style is superior to the Western parenting style.  However, she explains that \\"Battle Hymn\\" turned into a book about how she was humbled by her family (most notably by one of her daughters).  While this may have been her intention she makes it very clear how she believes unequivocally that Chinese parenting is the only way to raise successful children.  But success is an ambiguous term.  To some parents a child's success means that they don't end up in prison.  Yet other parents see that their children are successful when they go to college, can maintain a good job, work hard, and are decent citizens.  To Chua a successful child is a child who gets nothing less than straight A's, works tirelessly (with no breaks or \\"fun times\\") at perfecting the violin or the piano, goes to an Ivy League college, and perfects pretty much every other thing they do and say.  When you decide to read this book I would recommend that you be open minded, no matter what your definition of raising successful children may be.  I wasn't open minded and I only ended being infuriated and disgusted by practically every word and page.  Being open minded might at least give you an understanding of why Amy Chua raised her children the way she did.  Because I wasn't I had to think very long and hard about the variety of situations she describes.  This is where I realized that I could have just picked up my metaphorical pencil the moment I started reading the book.  I could have saved myself plenty of time bending over and trying to pick it up multiple times.<br /><br />I came to one main realization after opening my mind to Amy Chua's (Chinese way) way of parenting.  While I do not agree with the excessive way she parented her children I do find that the very basics of her parenting makes logical sense.  For example, she expected her children to practice their instruments (the instruments had to be a violin or piano; the children had no other choices) five hours a day, even during their vacations and weekends.  I can see the validity in having children learn musical instruments.  It teaches discipline, responsibility, and the importance of hard work.  While the piano and violin are notably the most difficult instruments to master I believe that a child can still be successful by mastering some other instrument.  I also believe that practicing five hours a day (and being forced to do so) is not necessary.  My children do not have to be perfect at what they do.  But I would sure hope that they are good at what they do and that they always enjoy it, despite the fact that they have to work hard.  This example, among several other examples in the book, shows that I do in some way agree with the Chinese way of parenting, but I do not agree with the excessive nature in which they parent.  But the point is not that I agree or disagree with her.  She can verbally abuse her children (by her own admission).  I have chosen to not do that (every parent makes mistakes, but I would hope that I would never call my children \\"garbage\\"). I would also hope that readers of this book can tell how much Amy Chua loves her children and is completely dedicated and devoted to them, despite the things that I feel are wrong or illogical.<br /><br />Even though the definitions of dedication, devotion, and success are going to be different for everyone, I hope that anyone who reads this sees that Chua firmly believed that she was only helping her children to be the best they could possibly be.  I will let you read the ending, but she knew that her family was falling apart, so in a way she really was humbled by her daughter, like I explained earlier. Yet she didn't compromise her lifestyle and she continued to maintain her beliefs about the Chinese way of parenting.  I admire her tenacity, even though I could never raise my children the way she has.<br /><br />If you are anything like the \\"Western Parents\\" she so poignantly implies as being undedicated, lenient, and passive there will be a clash of opinion between you and Chua.  Several times throughout her book she implies or flat out states that Western parents, in general, are not dedicated or hard working enough to raise truly successful children.  Just remember that this is not fact.  It is merely opinion, just like it is opinion when one says she is wrong.  I would highly recommend one to figure this out before you delve into \\"Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother.\\"  Even if you don't try to be open minded you will still find this book to be gripping and intriguing.  But save yourself some irritation and put your pencil away before you drop it again.
B007BT0RKG|5.0|I just love to have it on my Fire. Nice details on the additional country map download. And its free.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|It is really sad. The whole series started of so goood with a wide range of charachters and a daring, to kill a some of the supposed main ones off.<br />And then.... Adding more characters without purpose, without meaning... Just more. No direction. The author confesses he struggled with last books, well... Stuggled and failed. And it was a complete waste of time. For him as a writer and for me as a reader. Despite really enjoying the first two books, now I'd say don't bother. It is a true dissapointment.<br />Mr Martin thanks his editors, well - I blame them for doing a poor job. They didn't support him enough and in the end published crap that is not worthy of the first books.  It is just sad.
0345803485|5.0|I enjoyed the book very much. A steamy novel with a good story that kept me insterested the entire book. Can not wait to read the next one.
B007Z9RAX4|5.0|I don't even know why I'm writing this review. You can't trust the reviews on Amazon for movies, at least. Last night, I actually watched \\"This Means War\\" because a bunch of people on Amazon said it was really good (action meets romantic comedy). It was maybe the worst movie I've ever seen. Then I come on here to re-rent Haywire (because it was that good) and see all the bad reviews.<br /><br />What's WRONG with people?!<br /><br />I originally saw this movie (in the theater) because Ewan McGregor (who I love) was in it... but MAN, the lead woman was AMAZING! She blew Ewan away!!<br /><br />I just really really loved this movie. It reminded me a bit of Kill Bill (which I also loved). FULL of action and a little bit of humor too. If you like intelligent action movies that kick ass... I highly recommend.
B00000IQW5|5.0|I saw this movie in 1990, shortly after it was released.  My lady loved it because it was a classic \\"Chick-Flick\\" with romance and comedy.  I loved it because of all the firefighting action, and the cool WWII aircraft.  I know it is a Hollywood movie, and not real.  I am a 30 plus year volunteer firefighter, and a private pilot since 1972.  It is still one of the best movies around that a guy will enjoy watching along with his lady.
0345803485|5.0|Immediately the characters grabbed me into their story.  I enjoy books that entertain, make me want to ignore my duties, keep me up at night and take me way.  These books had it all yet... I couldn't share the story with my friends.  You don't want to give anything away.  We spoke in criptic references to chapters.  You knew which book they are reading and can't help but say \\"Wait until Chapter X!\\".  It was a lovely story of growth, personal and as a couple. A great read.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome game isn't it I love it get the app look at. it right fun is it not wow cool
B0086700CM|5.0|I really didn't think I was going to like this game, but found that it was extremely addicting. Tons of fun, unless you don't like restarting every time you fall or run into something. This definetely frusterated me at first, but now I play all the time. Ran down my battery without even noticing!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|It was a very emotional/stressful story...but I would not<br />have it any other way.<br />Enjoyed and plan on reading it again!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I thought the book contained too much sexual vulgarity!  It was demeaning for any woman that thought she had to be a submissive to a controller. I wonder how many women are out there thinking this??? I stopped reading it about half way through. I would not recommend the book.

B006ZZANDI|5.0|After continuously searching for this in stores, I was afraid that I would not be able to find it, when finally I found it on Amazon! And it is amazing!

B004XJRQUQ|1.0|No civilization in rocorded history has ever practiced such a terrible practice of forcing children to murder each other for the supposed entertainment of it citizens.  There is something sick in the mind of someone who thinks up such a thing and sadly also a reflection of how many sick minds we have in our socirty for enjoying such a story.  This shows that Grave's theory on levels of existance have quite a long way to go yet!
B0086700CM|5.0|it is an amazing ga.me and worth every penny. I would play all day if could and I would want e everyone to. have a chance to play it

B007OAAK0O|5.0|what can be said of the Diva of all Divas?  I've waited a life time to see the full rained out concert and this does not disappoint, it is legendary!  Diana Ross is the Queen of the stage and this concert proved \\"beyond a shadow of a doubt that she is the stuff that entertainment legends are made of\\".<br />Every child should see this and then they'll understand why Diana Ross wipes the floor with the likes of Beyonce, Brittany, and GaGa.  They'll never be another performer like her...
B0086700CM|5.0|I've been waiting for this game for a long time and now its finally here!!!! I totally reccomend it for anyone!

B0086700CM|5.0|I don't usually play many free games, because to be honest they usually aren't very good. This game is definitely the exception to the rule.  Its more entertaining than most games out there, paid or free. I find it hard to put down. Works great on the Kindle Fire. I would of gladly paid for this. Highly recommend trying it out... Why not, it's FREE .
B005K2YXHO|5.0|This case is stylish, rugged, and the perfect fit for your Kindle. I use it with my [[ASIN:B005890G8Y Kindle Touch, Wi-Fi, 6\\" E Ink Display - includes Special Offers & Sponsored Screensavers]], and it's easy to stow away, carry along, and toss around without having to worry about damaging your Kindle. The envelope style makes it super easy to access quickly without dealing with zippers and the like, while also keeping dirt and bottom-of-the-backpack lint out. Definitely the #1 choice for a Kindle case if you don't want to have some leather or plastic contraption bulking up your Kindle.
B0073PPKNM|3.0|Fans of Melody's sophomore effort may be a little surprised by the Latin jazz direction of this album. There are some really exceptional tracks here - the Argentinian tango of \\"Impossible Love,\\" the trademark Gardot jazz ballad in \\"So We Meet Again My Heartache,\\" and the burlesque, attitude-laden \\"Goodbye\\" come to mind. Ms. Gardot's relaxed, breezy, sometimes moody style in the context of Latin music sometimes works, and sometimes does not. The first single, \\"Mira\\" is an example of the latter. The song is pleasant enough but forgettable, and not very representative of the album as a whole. \\"Amalia\\" fares better in that it stands as a stronger, more enjoyable meshing of Gardot's old and new styles. Overall, the album is hit and miss, with the balance between the two categories pretty much up to each individual listener's willingness to embrace Melody's new artistic direction on this record. As an artist, I completely understand the need to re-invent oneself and experiment with new sounds to add flavor and more colors to your work. The fact that I enjoy the tracks which most closely resemble Ms. Gardot's previous records speaks to my own preferences, but it shouldn't discourage anybody to give this album a listen - it's a solid record. However, if this is your first album from Melody, I would recommend checking out \\"My One and Only Thrill\\" first - a more straightforward jazz/blues record where nearly every track could be a single.

0062011847|5.0|As I said, words fail me, but that never stops me from tossing them around. I find that, at this stage in the saga of Discworld, I really can't review a single book. Terry Pratchett has produced a body of work that is wise, hilarious, deep, true, profound. You owe it to yourself to read every book in the Discworld series, and to read them in the order in which they were written - not because you'd be confused if you didn't, but because you shouldn't miss out on the joy of seeing the author grow as both a writer and a human being. Terry Pratchett is a wise man, and his wisdom is accessible to all of us, a gift to be savored. If you haven't yet ventured into Discworld, I envy you! Don't wait a moment longer.
B0086700CM|5.0|I think temple run is awesome! its the best!!!!<br />I like how you can unlock different tools to use and power ups! its awesome!!!!
B0086700CM|4.0|This game is highly addictive, very intuitive, and incredibly precise and responsive (controls).  However, the Kindle Fire edition can glitch frequently.  In a game that requires exact timing, this is unacceptable.  PLEASE FIX!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game but I wish you didn't have to worry about running out of energy. if you didn't run out of energy so fast it would be a lot more fun.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is so awesome I waited so long 4 this now I got it!<br />q w e r t y u I o p a s d f g h j k l z x c v b n m.
0380807343|3.0|I enjoyed this book, though I am an adult. It is engaging and imaginative but I found it lacking in an emotional resolution that would have made it unforgettable. It's a dark, horror story for kids who enjoy a scare. It's not bloody or violent but psychologically scary with creepy illustrations to go with it.It plays on childhood frustrations with the adults who don't always pay enough attention to children. I could see ten to twelve, thirteen year olds really enjoying the story. I like a children's book that does try to scare because I think dealing with fears through stories is a good way to get over fears. The idea of a dark book for children is tantalizing because so many children's stories are saccharine. That is why I liked Gaiman's The Graveyard Book.<br /><br />The story's basis in childhood frustration could be much more emotionally effective if the story had engaged me emotionally. There are several reasons this didn't happen. First of all, Coraline, though she has determination, isn't interesting enough and she doesn't go through a change. She begins the story as an intelligent girl who is used to being on her own and having to entertain herself because her parents are too busy. She complains but there isn't anything special about her that makes you sympathize with her. She discovers a passage to the \\"other\\" world where her \\"other\\" mother, father and neighbors live. They resemble her real family but they have black buttons for eyes and the other mother tries to entice Coraline to stay with her by promising good food, games and love. If Coraline doesn't cooperate she will be punished. Now had the other world had a sort of candy-coated sweetness overlaying the sinisterness and the other mother shown Coraline some attention, the story would have been more interesting. Coraline would be tempted to stay. Instead the world is sinister and dark so Coraline immediately sets out on a quest to save some children's souls and find her real parents so she can go home.However when she gets home, her parents, who were being held in a sort of suspended world by the other mother, haven't changed. Coraline hasn't discovered something new about herself. It seems that life will go on as unremarkably and boringly as before. What was the point?
B0086700CM|5.0|it is the best game in the world!!!everybody should get this game!!!! I think everydody will luv this game!!!its the best!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is such a great game and there trying to copy temple run with some stupid game called temple ruin. and once I saw temple run I was like omg temple run YAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007PS0X0W|2.0|What's with all the 5 star reviews? Are these people middle-schoolers or production/distribution company lackeys?<br /><br />I'm a fan, but this new addition is an embarrassment to Len Wiseman's brainchild and Kate Beckinsale's talent. After the first 15 minutes, it becomes obvious that this is nothing more than a revenue generator. The writing had flashes of brilliance, but it means nothing when the directing and overall production is amateur. I was optimistic that the quality would be on par with past installments, but I was wrong. Very disappointing to one of my favorite franchises and I sincerely hope a 5th addition is axed to save from adding insult to injury. Len, what happened???
B004VMUS9G|5.0|its great. the best thing is that if u want to set it for evert week it will. sometimes I will even forget and it wakes me up and say wyldlife. I named that so I could remeber.
B0086700CM|4.0|This game is addictive, yet oh so much fun. Besides a few glitches here and there, the thing runs great. So glad I downloaded. it :)
B0086700CM|3.0|love the game<br />lags on the kindle and doesn't always register swipes to turn,run,  or slide<br />I always die because of this and its annoying
B001E45XT4|2.0|Loved the headset for 6 months, and then the plastic in the headband cracked. Surprisingly, there is no interior support.<br />Overall, great sound and mic, but the hardware won't last.
B003J5UIRS|5.0|If you have spent a great deal of time researching the possibilities of life before life (reincarnation), this may not be the book for you. If, however, you are a neophyte to this area or are seeking an excellent summation text that thoroughly reviews Stevenson's and other more recent studies, this is an excellent gem!<br /><br />The author, like Stevenson, does not give any definitive conclusions to whether or not reincarnation is a reality or a myth. He responsibly leaves this for the reader to determine. He does, however, examine any and all explanations for the 2500+ studied reports that come from various parts of the world and implicitly shows that reincarnation is the most plausible conclusion to reach in most cases. While there are portions of the individual studies that each of us will have a difficult time with, the data is there and while metaphysical issues do not appear to have concrete solutions in our lifetimes the foundations have been solidly laid.<br /><br />One of the most frequent comment by the skeptics as their 'proof' that reincarnation is a myth is \\"Because the subjects do not remember these previous experiences when they become adults, they must have simply been childhood fantasies!\\". This complaint is easily refuted by the fact that childhood amnesia (the failure of nearly all children to forget ALL events before the age of five), while unexplained, exists worldwide and, of course, would include any early memories of previous experiences.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is awesome if you have coordination! :) You should really get it! It's not like any other game! :) its the bestttttttttttttttttttttttttttt gameeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee everrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr outttttttttttttt theirrrrrrrrrrrr

B007V2UGPE|4.0|A cute time waster. I am still trying to figure it all out,  but enjoying it. The game has great graphics on the Kindle Fire. Thanks!
B000002UTY|5.0|Have just updated my much loved record of this to cd.<br />No real sonic leap forward in sound, but I can sit and hear it all in one go and not get up.<br />One of the great live albums of all time.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|the game is so fun but recently it wouldn't let me on for weeks I had to delete it not sure if I deleted my Colours and my games I will be so mad if it did!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|so much fun! I played it for like three hours straight. you will enjoy this game a lot.  I didn't know what it was unroll I got it and I love it!<br />p.s love ya world
B002PMPTIO|5.0|I enjoyed this new version of Star Trek, I thought it was done well and will appeal to Star Trek fans and non Star Trek fans. I think it is a proper way to reboot a TV/Movie franchise that has appealed to people for over 40 years. Amazon unbox is a great service and I highly endorse, almost all my video comes from unbox.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is beyond addictive you won't be able to stop playing it... &lt;3 this game it truly doesn't disappoint!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game and have waited for it for months and am glad amazon listened to everyone and got this game on the market now they just need tiny tower
B0086700CM|5.0|At first the whole concept of monkeys with skulls outside their heads chasing me creeped me out but its actually a really fun game.
B000EOTAM6|5.0|Actually A Great Movie, for an old abstract MTV cartoon! This movie has surprising depth and I for one am ok with anything Charlize Theron does.
B0086700CM|5.0|I've been waiting for temple run on aneroid foreveeeeer and it does not disappoint. it feels great on the kindle fire and I've had no problems w running this and 4 other processes. great, thanks for all the good work!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love temple run. its like the best app i have. And if u dont like temple run then your crazy

B00001QEE8|5.0|This product was shipped exactly how I expected it. This vendor really met my expectations as a shopper. I wasn't sure what to expect upon buying this product but I was not disappointed. Thanks.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I installed this app on my kindle fire and it has become addicting!  I have always enjoyed Solitaire and this one is great.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have always played temple run on my brothers ipod or moms ipad. &amp;&amp; I'm so happy they put this game on Amazon! I have always loved this game its so addicting!
B007MNV5WU|3.0|this angry bird game is not as good as the rest. not worth it at all. way to short the other angry bird games are longer and down to earth (you can shoot eaiser)LOL
145162445X|5.0|Lawrence Krauss' newest book is remarkably readable, plus it makes one think beyond the parameters of everyday, commonly held concepts about the world around us.  Mr. Krauss is both a smart writer and a clever thinker in that he can bring the reader around to a way of looking at the universe as it actually is, not as religious \\"historians\\" wish you would believe it to be.  Kudos to the author for a brilliant bit of reading!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love the large buttons and screen. I have trouble with my sight so the large size of the calculator is perfect for me.
0345803507|1.0|In book one, Anastasia Steele, a true innocent, meets Christian Grey, a true pervert, and sparks fly, spiked with a range of dangerous sex toys. Ana soon has her first sexual encounter, followed by another every 30 seconds or so, as long as this trilogy shall live.  As Christian, age 27, earns close to a billion dollars a year (doing what?)and longs to cure world hunger and promote alternative energy, he is deemed more worthy than your average everyday S&M loving perv.  Ah!  The twists and turns of loving such a man!<br /><br />Adding to the tension of this three-volume non-page-turner is the juvenile writing style.  Before the first chapter ends the reader is ready to tear out her hair due to Ana's constant \\"oh mys!\\", \\"holy this and thats!\\", references to her inner goddess, subconscious and other imaginary beings, and just plain repetitive stupidity.<br /><br />Please, E.L. James:  Do NOT write another book!  This trilogy was three too many from your amateurish pen.  But I know you will.  Why wouldn't you want to earn more praise and dollars from romance novel fans who dream of a gorgeous 27-year-old multibillionaire ravaging them, sexually torturing them and stimulating their \\"sex\\"?  I was persuaded to read this disaster by well-meaning friends.  They were wrong and I can hardly wait to get back to reading real authors.  And real books.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|its worth the 99 cents. fun fun fun ! I own them all and this one and seasons are the best so far
B000BZISTE|5.0|An unusual film that changed the way viewers looked at Vietnam, or at any war for that matter. Whether you agree with it or not, its message is still valid today in light of current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.<br /><br />It is interesting to note that 20th Century produced this movie while they were already working ot two other major war productions, Tora Tora Tora and Patton. Both those movies, in their very different ways, portrayed American military leaders in a positive, even heroic, light. MASH makes fun of them in a way that almost makes fun of war, if that is at all conceivable.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|It's a good, mindless, quick summer read.  I wasn't planning on going on to the next book but it leaves you hanging a bit. I want to know what comes next so I'm going to order book two.
B005EGXTL2|5.0|I really enjoyed Mockingjay and once I started reading it was very hard to put the book down.  All three in the trilogy are excellent.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|love it. this game and rio and the first game are far the best. just remember to skip angry birds in space(to short). can't wait till they come out with another one :)
B00005PSY8|4.0|I'm a little late writing a review. Okay shipping, but it's from out of the country. Record works great though :-)<br />Thank you again amazon for helping me with my shopping a lot easier then going to a store and have to deal with the craziness.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|...... . . . ..... . . . . . . . . . . V v s w dikbd
B0055SWM08|4.0|The game is well done and fun yet challenging to play, a great one for winding down at night but I had no obsessive drive to play it even weekly.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|a very interesting game - the energy budget sometimes makes it a bit slow, but still very interesting.  I will keep playing and see what comes next.
B0086700CM|5.0|It is one of my favorite games in the world. I can't wait to play some more. I love it.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|after you get into it it's really fun. all those complaining about not getting put of it, it's. not that hard. and those parents who don't read the clear warnings and tell you to put a lock on finances well that's on you...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I first heard about how terrific the book was on a flight to L.A.  Then saw all of the lines of people to see the movie, who were talking about how great it was.  I thought since it was a book for young adults, it might not appeal to me but decided to try it because I knew I'd probably see the movie at some time and wanted a reference point so I bought the Kindle version.  I couldn't put it down!  I was immediately hooked from the first page and finished it in about a day and quickly ordered \\"Catching Fire\\", the second book in the series.  I'm waiting for a good time to buy the third book so I can dive right in and READ without interruption!
B0086700CM|5.0|addicting! fast-paced fun! what could be more fun than to have an endless supply of energy for running? I like the ability to earn the coins needed to upgrade your character. this game is good frustrating fun.
0345803485|1.0|Clearly the majority of America's reading female population never read Penthouse Forum because that is all 50 Shades is! I borrowed from a friend, curious about all the hype, and couldn't even finish it. For ONCE I wanted more plot and less sex scenes!!  At first intriguing- the virgin, ingenue, seduced by the fabulously wealthy and handsome alpha male. But it quickly turned into the insipid, virgin girl introduced to the &#34;unrealistic&#34; world of multiple orgasms by a control freak.  I guess I should leave well enough alone and be happy that all these &#34;50 Shades&#34; fans now have a legit way to read erotica without having to ask for the magazine behind the drugstore counter and have been introduced to certain peccadilloes they would not have known about otherwise, but I just hope their teen daughters don't get hold of their copy because they will have unrealistic expectations about sex.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple run is finally in the app store. Really fun game always is really fun. Best game I ever played.
B007K3JCAE|4.0|Okay, so if you liked the first one chances are you'll enjoy this one. It's not quite as good but a worthwhile sequel. If you're questioning buying this because you see lots of low starred reviews give them a read first. A majority of these people aren't reviewing the movie, rather they're upset about the UltraViolet copy. Which by the way you can use to download the movie to your device. Yes, it's a pain because you can't just do a direct transfer from the disc to your computer/device but you still can get an actual copy of it.<br />So back to the movie: it's fun, well acted (Downey as always is fantastic) and has the great action scenes we've come to expect from Mr. Ritchie. If you're like me and have read the books (practically free on kindle [[ASIN:B004LE7PCM THE COMPLETE SHERLOCK HOLMES and THE COMPLETE TALES OF TERROR AND MYSTERY (All Sherlock Holmes Stories and All 12 Tales of Mystery in a Single Volume!) ... Conan Doyle   The Complete Works Collection)]]) you'll see lots of nods to different stories, primarily \\"the final problem\\". Moriarty is as devious as ever and you really start to wonder if Holmes is in over his head. The final fight was very unexpected and quite fun. Finally, those who think the original films were true to the books should give the books a read (ie: Holmes never ever says \\"Elementary my dear Watson\\" nor is he some stuffy old man). The books/short stories are classics for a reason and still have relevancy. I found many more connections in the first & second Downey Holmes movies than a lot of those older movies.
B0086700CM|5.0|nice game, when u have some time to waste, or not, lol. really id recommened it anytime, thanks imangi studios, keep em coming!
B0086700CM|5.0|I really do love this app. when I first saw it on the app store I was like WOAHH its finally here. ever since then I have been addicted to this game... its ok though because it is a fun game and you know what.... it can actually help with brain power... because ever since ive been playing it I have increased my Gpa and I am in all ap classes next year. KEEP UP THE RUNNING, AND NEVER DOUBT THE TEMPLE RUN!!!! ITS FREAKING AMAZING... and free
B005ZUR724|5.0|ok its not deep like wow but for a tablet mmo its awesome. when the tech is better and tablets can keep up with laptops the mmo scene for mobiles will get better but for the time being this is as good as its going to get.
0740797719|5.0|First off, not only does he write these very helpful resource books, he also has a blog and many videos talking about similar topics trying to help artists get better.  His work is beautiful and his knowledge is pure gold.  Even if you know a good deal of the art theory stuff, just having it all in one helpful book by topic is great for reference.  It is worth getting for his diagrams and pictures alone.  Even as a coffee table book for non-artists it's still valuable.
B007QXU0ZO|5.0|I never really got into Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeros when I first heard them on the radio with their hit single, \\"home\\". I like the song alot, maybe I just passed it off as one of those one hit wonders and didn't feel I needed to investigate them more. I WAS WRONG.<br /><br />I saw they had a new album being released so I thought i'd give it a go, it was well worth it. This is one of those genre busting bands that you can't put a tag on. Although if I had to it would be gospel/folk. I might have just started a new genre, if so you heard it here first, tell your friends. The first song is a perfect example.... \\"Man on Fire\\" this sound could have easily been released from the 60's to present day. To top it off I'm pretty sure there is a didgeridoo in mixed in the song as well. \\"That's Whats Up\\" and \\"I don't want to pray\\" are really strong songs as well. Mayla is a good one instrumentally but I think they could have left off what minimal singing there was, kind of ruins it. \\"Dear Believer\\" is a great tune, they even solve the answer of why we are on Earth in the song... \\"Reaching for heaven is what I'm on Earth to do...\\" Just Beautiful, I'm not a religious guy by any means but you can take it any way you want to. \\"One Water\\" is a more country-esque song that could have been heard in the 70's rocking out with Lynyrd Skynyrd. And to close it all out they have the dreamy tune \\"All Wash Out\\".<br /><br />Tell your friend to tell their friends, to tell their friends about this one. Now I've got to go listen to their older stuff....<br /><br />harpelli.blogspot.com/ for more reviews and music recommendations

B0086700CM|5.0|this game is super fun I love it. I like the fact that you have to be really fast but it sooooo fun!
B005721Y7Y|4.0|this movie is about life and how real it is it makes you notice how life is so beautiful and you shouldn't miss out on anything the storyline on the movie couldn't be any better it hits topics where other movies don't open your eyes

0307887960|5.0|We sent for the book in April, and received it very quickly. Hubby had read about the diet at the library, so we ordered the book. We have been impressed with how easy it is to read, how well the directions are written and how well the diet actually works!!! Hubby has lost 10lbs and I have lost 15!!!<br />the content of the book is great, the condition of the book is excellent and the time of arrival was within only a couple of days.

B0086700CM|5.0|Love this freaking game so freaking addicting I love it so freaking much and by the way people my name is Jack Mehoff! xD You don't get it!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Wow, I'm obsessed with these characters. I would love for it to be made into a movie. This is one of those books that you devour yet never want the story to end. It consumed me for the 24 hours that it took me to read and now I will read it again at a slower pace. I seldom do that but I just loved this crazy, flawed love story. I made myself stay up late to keep reading. I hurt and felt elated for both of the main characters. It didn't feel contrived and it took me on a ride with the ups and downs of it all. My only pet peeve doesn't have anything to do with the story, just the E-book typos...there are a few of them. Buy this book, you won't be sorry. I want more like this!
B007T9UIMA|5.0|Words cannot explain how exciting this is!!!! This dvd will give me goosebumps:)!! One Direction is amazing and wonderful! They sing awesome live and they love to preform in front of people. Also, they are so funny and fun! Loving the dvd!:)
B006OE7XM4|5.0|Standards or contemporaries Gregory Porter infuses in a melodious irresistable stew that's good for the soul. We saw him perform Water in Boston. Unlike many performers his vocals are as true live as on \\"the wax\\". If you're on the fence about this one, get off and get it done.
B0086700CM|1.0|I thought that temple run is nice. It made me happy. It is entertaining and addicting. I hope others get to enjoy this app.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so addicting, i could just not get enough!!!<br />if you wanna get a game, GET THIS ONE!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|you are weird if you think temple run is Bab temple run is great the greatest game every I think they should make a Tv show about it that would be great.
0345803485|1.0|Let me first start by saying, I love to read.  Adore it.  However, this is the first book which made me wish I were illiterate.  It is the most repetitive inane piece of writing I think I have ever read.  For some reason, my book club picked this book.  I think our discussion will actually be fun because we can pick apart how truly horrendous this book is.<br /><br />Not to ruin the end for anyone, but I hope Ana keeps on sobbing and I could not care less about what happens next as I will not be reading, what I assume, are the other two ridiculous books in this trilogy.
B000009RC2|5.0|This wonderful album continues to confound copyists and delight those with open minds and ears. In my view, the best rock/jazz album ever.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|50 shades of Grey was easy to read, and full of sex, sex, sex!  Not just sex, but fantastically hot sex.  This book should be a must read for women and should be made into a film for their husbands to take notes from.  I've jsut finished the third book, and am ready to start over on the first book again.  Highly recommended reading!
B000UX6THK|5.0|...is a soap opera, a crime show, a supernatural thriller, and pure crazy-raggedy-paranoiac-gorgeous David Lynch. And that doesn't even being to describe it. The atmosphere is so tantalizing, dangerous and bizarre yet warm and even sentimental... it feels like an homage to small-town America in many ways, and Northwestern America specifically (where Lynch grew up, I think). I honestly don't know what to say about this show, I just wanted to post a glowing review to prove that I have a heart. Absolute adoration and unequivocal love is always the hardest feeling to articulate...<br /><br />Seriously: even if you don't watch TV, if you don't ever get hooked on a television show, if the phrase \\"soap opera\\" sends shudders down your spine -- buy this, or find a friend with Netflix instant and watch every episode online. If you're not absolutely transfixed after the pilot alone, I'll eat Dale Cooper's tie.
B0086700CM|5.0|When I first got my Fire, people would ask &quot;Do you have Temple Run?&quot; they'd show me on their ipads and I'd say no. But now I have it and its GREAT! But only buy it if you don't mind getting addicted to it. haha! ;)
0345803493|5.0|I think if you are wanting Twilight then you are not really looking for the right book. I liked the Twilight series but this is so much better!!! I love the book and hope to see maybe another one in the future. I am sure I will read these over and over!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|great on the kindle fire.  love it!  even better than on the ipod.  now I don't have to &quot;borrow &quot; my hubbys opossum anymore to play. so glad it finally came out for kindle!
1594203334|5.0|I loved this book and found it pretty mind-blowing! I am so glad that I have read it (especially since I do not have children yet). I always had the view that being a parent was a total drag and that the rest of your life pretty much disappeared once you had babies. I assumed that having kids would totally change your personality into that of an obsessed, hyper-vigilant, super-micromanaging, overprotective dictator over your children. At least that is what I was seeing around me, and it looked totally unappealing. I am a laid back person and \\"having\\" to act like that in order to parent seemed pretty scary, and was something I wasn't really looking forward to. But now I know, thanks to reading this book, that turning into that kind of parent-monster is a culturual thing, that you do NOT have to do it, that other countries don't do it, and that they (and their children) are actually better off for it. Such a relief! I think this would be an amazing baby shower gift for a progressive mom-to-be (unless the intended recipient has already gone overboard with all the don't-do/eat-this-child-warning-danger-books, which most of my friends fell victim to; then it might be insulting). A great eye-opening read for people thinking about having children.
B0086700CM|3.0|i love this game but it is extremely hard to play when its lagging constantly. that is a huge downside to the game. i hope over time it gets updated and works better on the fire.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I use the pack regularly.  It is a good pack but not a great one.  Not as high quality as a tamrac but for the price it will work.  I would order again but know that this isn't the end all be all camera bag.  It is a little light on the material in my opinion.  It works and I like it compared to spending a couple hundred on another bag.  I will upgrade later but this will do the trick for now.
B007UZO3F6|5.0|If you've done your research on this box, you'll know that if you've got an Ivy Bridge processor you'll need to have BIOS version 107 or higher installed just to boot the machine.<br /><br />Some of these boxes have been shipping with older BIOS versions, meaning that anyone with a newer processor is basically screwed unless they request a new BIOS chip from Shuttle.  (They'll Fedex you the chip at no charge, and swapping it out takes literally 5 seconds.)<br /><br />I purchased through Amazon seller \\"Platinum Micro\\".  A sticker on the motherboard indicated it came from the factory with 106, but when I booted up with my Ivy Bridge chip in there, I was happy to see that 107 was already loaded.  So no worries there.<br /><br />This is a great little box.  Not the quietest thing in the world, but the included heatpipe system seems to work well enough.  Once you install the drive cage things get really tight, so routing cables becomes a bit of an art.<br /><br />So far no complaints.  Been running Win7 on here for a few weeks and no problems at all!
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is the perfect game to waste hours on. It's repetitive, but it never gets boring. I love it!
0345803485|1.0|I bought this book because of the rave reviews. I went in with an open mind.  Romance novels are NOT my typical read, but because of the way this book was splashed all over tv and the internet with women raving about it I figured I needed to read it.<br /><br />I've read trashy romance novels before, usually the really cheap Harlequin Blaze novels you find at Barnes and Noble for about 3.99 each.  There is not ONE THING in Fifty Shades of Grey that I have not read before in a cheap romance novel. I thought the least the author could do was include an actual story line, (something you don't often get with trashy romance books) She didn't even do that! No story, no character development.  The sex was pretty graphic, but like I said, that does NOT set it apart then any other romance novel you would find on any shelf in any bookstore in the world.  Even the S&M stuff I've read before in books!. This book was horribly written, repetitive, and just plain boring. Please, do not believe the hype. Save your time and your money and you'll get the same experience a lot cheaper with any old romance book.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|I spent 6 dollars trying to download. I love this game but I cant Play it if it wont download.
B006UREQ3Y|5.0|This is a fantastic DVD made in his hometown where they never played with GNR. They do both Slash material and GNR material. Myles Kennedy is an excellent singer. Arrived before estimated delivery date. I suggest you pick up this DVD.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|thought the book sophomoric at best.  if sex didnt sell, there would be no excuse for this<br />absurd story. would not recommend.
B005I6EU7U|4.0|I bought this to review on Tech Reviews and Help, and I found this is a great cover. Simply, the only problem is there is no place to keep your papers, and it's only a cover. There is covers out there that cost the same and acts like a stand. But they don't look as good.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book was a difficult read. I downloaded the sample to my Kindle and after reading those first two chapters could not understand what all of the uproar was about. I'll admit that I was curious, but not quite curious enough to want to spend almost $10 to find out if there was more to the story than what I'd seen. Surely there must have been a reason why the book was such a hot seller! In the interest of full disclosure, I did end up reading and finishing the book, but only by skimming to the end.<br /><br />A major issue for me was that the book is poorly written and in desperate need of editing, so much so that I kept being pulled out of the story because of the repetitive wording and awkward phrasing. Anastasia was constantly flushing (113 times, if you use the search feature!), and she and Christian seemed to only communicate verbally via murmuring and whispering, just as a couple of examples. Another issue was that the book is written in 1st person. I usually don't have a problem with that, but I found Anastasia to be so irritating that it was painful to be \\"inside her head\\". She was supposed to be a college graduate with a high GPA, but she came across to me as more of an insipid and extremely naive teenager. Everything surprised her--\\"Wow!\\", \\"Holy Cow!\\", \\"Holy this!\\", \\"Holy that!\\" Then there was the dialogue from her \\"inner goddess\\" and her \\"subconscious\\", who were sort of the devil and the angel on each of her shoulders. That became tiresome quickly. I found Christian to be just as unlikable. He was wooden. It was clear that he had a troubled past, but that was a poor excuse for keeping him so distant. Yeah, he was handsome and rich, but beyond that, there wasn't much to him. Well, other than the fact that he liked to wear linen shirts and jeans. Oh, and he was into BDSM. But really? He has his potential submissives sign a contract before engaging with him? Basically he was a control freak. When he wasn't getting what he wanted by throwing money at it, hewas trying to get his way via punishment, e.g. spanking Anastasia for rolling her eyes at him. What a fun guy.<br /><br />The poor writing and the unlikable characters did this book in for me. Those are the main negatives. There are more. I found little that was redeemable about it. It's black and white for me--this was one of the worst books that I've read in a long time. Perhaps the only thing that will salvage this and make me feel better about wasting my time even skimming this story is that I'll be better able to appreciate the parodies. For someone looking to read something in this genre, run away and look elsewhere! There are many much better reads and much better crafted stories out there.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I live in the fickle Rocky Mountains and this app is a must for me. Love that i can track multiple locations.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Great fun that lasts a long time.  You can play over and over again.  Even when losing, the characters make losing fun (and a little frustrating).
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|really fun game. very entertaining. the energy timer is kind of annoying but its still really fun overall. 5 stars
B008518MOW|2.0|I saw this movie in the theater and won't buy the 3d version. The acting is above average. However, the plot is simple, so there are many unnecessary scenes and dialogue. I had a hard time sitting through the whole movie.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|I'm totally hooked. cant get enough of it. no complaints so far. don't see myself not playing it any time soon.
B000JMKO3C|4.0|This was a quick, fun read. I found it typical of a lot of European-style literature, a bit of a pretentious fluff piece but ultimately engaging enough to merit the cost of the book. Given Coelho's history, I'm giving it a higher star rating because I'm sure writing this book was very personal to him. I enjoyed the fact that, as in his other fiction, he tries to draw a larger portrait of the world via one simple storyline.<br />I'd recommend it to a friend for sure.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Always been a huge fan of picross games. This one is no different. Works great on my Thunderbolt. Pretty good amount of levels too. Worth it!
B0086700CM|5.0|First of all, yes! Finally. This has been one of my favorite games for a very long time. Its quick and fun, with a lot of &quot;adventure&quot;. It works very well on my Kindle Fire. So far, none of these reviews seem false to me. This is a cool game.
B0086700CM|5.0|I've had to use my friends itouches and ipads everytime I wanted to play this so it's about time amazon.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|As a Masters of English degree holding woman, I'm not ashamed to admit I really loved this series. I know many think it's poorly written with a hackneyed plot and have criticized the author for this, but I ask: who cares? Why does it have to be a brilliant piece of literature with masterful prose to deserve a read? If you're looking for a novel with inspiring verses and unending, overly artistic descriptions you want to highlight and quote forever, you won't find it here. It's very vernacular, but that makes it approachable - thus the millions reading it. There is something to be said for that.<br /><br />Ultimately, The Fifty Shades trilogy is just a romance about unconditional love. It just happens to be between some fairly kinky people with issues. E.L. James hit women (and brave men) with a story that provokes in many ways. Here is what you can expect (and what I most enjoyed):<br /><br />- The sex, which while copious and explicit, isn't grotesque at all. If anything, it's inspiring, playful, and awakening for many people...which is a great thing if you ask me! I think people need to stop evaluating the nuances (yes, it is a *tad* too perfect) and just have fun with the fantasy of it. America certainly isn't going to suffer with some more, ahem, satisfied people. Well done, Mrs. James.<br /><br />- The love story is slightly contrived, but captivating nonetheless. It is addicting for many because above all else, it is a romance. And despite the rough, we-can-tackle-anything exteriors most modern-age women display, most of us relish flowers and mushy stuff now and again. (If you don't, you'll appreciate the Mrs. Robinson character.)<br /><br />- The domination aspect is interesting. I readily admit I'm in the main demographics for this book: 30-something, married mom of 4 and as such, I lead a fairly traditional lifestyle where my husband and I are all about equality in our marriage. However, the truth is I'm the kid expert and even though I'm not the breadwinner, I run the house...unwillingly at times. Everyone waits for my lead. That's why I found the male character in here so attractive. His primal desire to take care of the protagonist - even though it's over the top and routed in his seriously traumatized youth - makes me swoon like a teenager. I'm sure in reality it would be restrictive and tiresome, but I would welcome it now and again. E.L. James gets this and allows us to gratefully indulge.<br /><br />-Finally, feminists criticize the book for it's supposed regression of what women (referencing the submissive qualities of the protagonist.) I disagree completely. I feel this series is actually empowering for women. For one, the protagonist was defiant and feisty (half her character's nature and half her obvious immaturity.) I didn't see her desire to please her love as submissive...it was out of unconditional love for him...which is considered a noble theme in countless works of literature throughout history. If anything, this book gets women talking about wants and desires. What could be more empowering than that?<br /><br />As for a review of this 3rd book in particular, the ending isn't it's selling point. It's fairly predictable and ties up in nice neat bow. It's the epilogue. THAT is the most intriguing part of the entire series if you ask me!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|this game is extremely fun, although it has a lot of glitches. that's why I rated it a four instead of a five

B0000JCFPE|4.0|If you tell me there's a detective movie with Michael Douglas and the most elegant and beautiful woman in cinema both featured, I'm not going to ask anything more.  Just buy it.  And don't worry about that 'interrogation scene'; it's in there too, not that I had any interest in it (of course.)
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this app and don't Liston to the 123 stared reviews this app is the shiznitz(Yahoo I said it) lol
B003ZSJ212|4.0|First and foremost, I really have to second Sloopydrew's review \\"The Fanboy Test vs. The Girlfriend Test\\".  It would be hard to write a much better review.  This DVD set is not perfect by any means, but the video and sound quality of the movies is amazing.  I never imagined the films looking this good.  I own a sound-bar, and the sound on that is amazing.  I can only imagine what it would be like on a high end digital surround system.  There are also a plethora of extras ranging from the 1970s to the present day.<br /><br />I decided to buy these because I really was sick of getting out my VHS player every time I wanted to watch the original trilogy.  Although these discs do not contain the theatrical releases of Episodes 4-6, it is possible to look past the tinkering for the convenience.  If you are a Star Wars original trilogy purist, this set is not for you.  However if you enjoy the new movies, and can make the best of the additions to the old films, this set is not to be missed.
0143038583|4.0|The Omnivore's Dilemma (a review)<br />Probably, if you were going to read it you have already, but if you haven't ... you might want to pick it up. It was the #1 New York Times Bestseller in 2006 and it's still quite relevant today -- maybe more so, who knows.<br /><br />Normally we may think of evolution as a drive toward complexity, but bacteria has gone the other direction, it's evolved downward into simplicity and into very niche environments. This is an excellent survival strategy - what will survive any catastrophe you can imagine? Somewhere, bacteria, probably.<br /><br />But most animals have opted for complexity and flexibility instead. They are able to move about and adapt to new environments. But here's the rub: since they choose to be flexible, they have to be flexible.<br /><br />There is a direct analogy in the gastronomic world, it turns out. Some creatures have taken the simple approach by consuming a limited range of things. They can afford to do this because they have evolved elaborate intestines with which to work food over thoroughly and in which to harbor bacteria which converts one sort of input into all the various nutrients their bodies need. These are the herbivores and carnivores, and genetic code alone, which we call instinct, is sufficient to get them fed. On the other hand, omnivores have taken the high road; their innards are leaner and less elaborate so they must gather the right mix of inputs themselves.  And in doing so, they must avoid the dangerous ones. This requires a lot of care, and thought, and therefore ... big brains. It's a tradeoff of a simple lifestyle and an elaborate belly, or a complicated lifestyle, and a lean interior. So the omnivore's dilemma is gathering how to gather the right foods and not take in the harmful kind.  That in itself is a dilemma, but Pollan points out there are plenty of moral quandries as well.<br /><br />The book is as entertaining as The Botany of Desire (2001), in which he looked at the storyof apples, potatos, tulips, and marijuana from the plants' perspective. Here he takes on corn, grass, meat, and fungus, and once again we benefit from his careful research and introspection (the latter, occasionally laid on a little thick, for my taste). He also does a great deal of field observation, visiting the food factories and farms, talking to many different kinds of people, gathering mushrooms, and even slitting some chicken necks himself, and shooting a wild boar.  He describes much of this so well I felt I had done it too.<br /><br />His best field trips included a large sustainable farm in Virginia where production is high, costs are relatively low, waste is almost nil, and the animals are mostly content. It's most impressive in the cleverness with which it all works, and the owner explains that in detail.  It's a stark contrast to some of the more corporate operations - like a standard corn-fed feedlot, a poultry farm, even an organic farm that turned out to be pretty much like the others. In these chapters the moral dilemmas come into the sharpest focus.<br /><br />Food -- if you haven't noticed --  has become a new moral battleground, and when Pollan disparaged the new methods, and the lower quality of food they sometimes produce at times I felt he didn't fully appreciate the countervailing moral implications of the much larger quantities turned out now.  All that food is a good thing, too.  When he marveled that corn production increased from 75 bu/acre in 1950 to 180 in 2006 (140% increase, and often to the detriment of small time farmers), he didn't mention that world population increased by 172% in the same period.  Sometimes I though it was a little one-sided because the older methods could not easily produce the food we need now.  Hybrid vigor, that gives us pumped up ears of corn, is itself infertile.  That's not a Monsanto conspiracy -- as he intimates -- it is a fact of nature.  Vigorous hybrids, like mules, are often -- oddly -- infertile.In the end it appears he was sometimes just exploring some of the more extreme views of his interviewees, as his own conclusions seemed balanced and reasonable, in my opinion.  As a reader I felt I had been treated fairly.<br /><br />First, it's corn's dizzying ascendency as a food source, with the field trip to a chemical plant that rips the kernal pulp apart, sending it out in a tangle of different spigots -- some headed for the gas tank, others to the various mixers of myriad foodstuffs, others to make non-edibles.  There's a good discussion of the political and economic forces driving the corn industry too.  In the second section, on  \\"grass,\\" he works on a the sustainable Virginia farm, among other things. When it comes to meat, he compares the sustainable approach to that in a large organic poultry operation, a feedlot, and commercial slaughterhouse, and more.  And all through the book he comments on underlying philosophical issues.<br /><br />And the section of fungus (mushrooms) is interesting from a botanical perspective, mostly.  It could have been in The Botany of Desire.  In the end he pulls the story together by describing his \\"perfect meal\\" made up of perfect ingredients, served to perfect guests.  That just seemed unnecessary, to me but by that time I'd had a good enough intellectual and philosophical material to chew on - enough food for thought, you might say - to forgive him a little retrospective self-indulgence.

B002T9H2LA|5.0|Upon first seeing Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds in the theatre a couple years ago, my initial reactions were mixed. While I certainly found it to be a very engaging film, with great mise-en-scene and that classic Tarantino dialogue, I was repulsed by it's content, it's lack of humanity, and the fact that so many people were reveling in it simply because it was Nazis being tortured and mutilated. And, being a student of history, I also wondered, \\"what the hell was up with that ending?\\" Thankfully, it was just that mixture of confusion and disgust that intrigued me enough to give it a second look. After all, I'm a die-hard Tarantino fan, and simply could not believe that such a brilliant director would make such a horrid exhalation of man's cruelty to man if there were not more to it; all his other films, violent as they may be, are centered on a warm, persevering humanity- a criminal caring for, and ultimately giving his life for, another; a mother seeking endlessly, albeit amid bloody revenge, to find her daughter. I am glad to say, after repeated viewing, I've finally figured it out. \\"Inglourious\\" is, in fact, a revenge tragedy, similar to Shakespeare's \\"Titus Andronicus\\" - coincidentally, another story that was, and is, reviled for it's grotesque inhumanity, so much so that many even today seek to exclude it from the Shakespeare canon. Yet the point of both stories are not the bloody acts of vengeance themselves, but the tragic consequences that arise when people forget their humanity and blindly pursue revenge. Perhaps, after \\"Kill Bill\\" QT felt it necessary to depict the awful realities of revenge; perhaps it is an effort to show a post 9-11 world that vengeance is vanity, and that bloodshed only leads to more bloodshed, as atrocities escalate and peace becomes ever more impossible. As Saladin said, \\"Blood that is spilt never sleeps.\\" Whatever the case, the film succeeds by taking arguably the most justifiable revenge- that of Jews against Nazis- andmaking it utterly unpalatable, shocking and disturbing. By the end, as in Shakespeare's play, nearly everyone lies dead, proof of the bitter fruits of vengeance single-mindedly pursued at all costs. In between, we are given plenty of subtle flashes of humanity awakened and forgotten in the swing of a bat, stroke of a knife or what have you. In light of this, I would have to say that Inglourious Basterds is indeed a great film, and not the reprehensible heroic-bloodshed garbage I first took it for. In short, if you can enjoy a mindless revenge fantasy about atrocious cruelty, and your conscience doesn't bother you, you can probably still enjoy this film without giving yourself a headache; but if your looking for something deeper, and don't aren't averse to a little subtext, \\"Inglourious\\" will reward you.
B0086700CM|5.0|I saw my sis play it and truer to find it on my kindle but no hope and I looked at apps and there it was I love it so so so so so mucch fun
B003Y5H5F6|4.0|Why can't they all just get along? The Vampires and Werewolves \\"at each others throats\\" for so many generations instead of letting bygones be bygones and teaming up to feed on us mere mortals...I mean...how silly! Well I guess it's a good thing for us though, no? Because without the war there would be no action-packed Underworld series.<br /><br />I'll try to keep this short since my review is a tad bit late to the party: The beginning of Awakening suggests that approximately 12 years ago the humans executed a major Vampire/Werewolf (Lycan) cleansing, but Selene (Kate Beckensale) was captured and frozen cryogenically in an experimental biotech lab. All other Vampires and Lycans have supposedly been exterminated...for the most part. Immortal survivors are in hiding literally underground...or should I say \\"Underworld\\". An unknown entity frees Selene from her ice-prison, and she creates absolute mayhem for anyone in her way to find out what has happened and where her beloved Vampire/Lycan hybrid Michael is.<br /><br />The effects in the entire series have been great and Awakening only improves on the tradition. The movie is a dark, but visual spectacular. There's suspense, tons of action and a great storyline from the start of the prequel called [[ASIN:B001VLFE7Q Rise of the Lycans]], to [[ASIN:B000TGJ80I the original]], through [[ASIN:B000F6IOBG Evolution]] and right up to Awakening.<br /><br />All in all a very well done continuation of the story that pays to watch from the beginning. Yes, Awakening stands alone, but this is one movie that I believe was not intended for seeing prior to its predecessors. So if you haven't already, you'll want to view both Underworld and Underworld Evolution and watch them in order. The prequel Rise is certainly not necessary, but it does add a bit of perspective and history to the story.<br /><br />Check 'em out.
