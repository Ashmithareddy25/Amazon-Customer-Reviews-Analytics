B001R6AW18|5.0|I love this movie.  What more could you ask for?  Jungle, evil natives, diversity, eveil white men, a barely clothed sliunky female all make for a great experience.  Far from politically correct, but a lot like Chicago and Newark today, except our monkey won't climb tall buildings!
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Love the math problems feature! It really helps my mind get going in the more making it easier to wake up rather than my usual snooze after snooze after snooze:)
B0060D0Z0G|4.0|We enjoyed the movie, just would like there to be more to it.  It was fast paced which is good in a movie but could feel the absence of what could have been a fuller storyline.
B0014BEDBG|5.0|Excellent performance def worth buying if your a jt fan shows he really cares about his fans and his music
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|We enjoyed the unique storyline and the refusal to give up to save lives.  An awakening in developing relationships is a very good part of this story.
B000H305U0|5.0|This cd has a great beat and lyrics all around great album shows how far he has come as a musician
B004Q3NBXU|4.0|There is a lot of focus on revenge and the saving grace of this movie is that forgiveness saved a life.  We say for mature audiences because one must understand that the vengeful acts in this movie are not the right way to solve problems.
B00005JM02|5.0|I have always love this movie and once my daughter started talking one of her first words was fish, so we decided to get this movie for her and she just loves the colors and everything else. Highly recommend it!
B005IEGUDY|3.0|I found myself lost in what I viewed as insequntial details.  I only got up to the middle of the book and lost interest.  In this time of my life a book like this is exhausting.  I read New York and enjoyed that one very much.  I totally respect Edward Rutherford's amazing research but it just wasn't for me.
B002GHIPYI|5.0|Really comfortable.<br />Excellent audio quality.<br />Good thick and long cable without interference.<br />Really can't beat this headphone with the price point. I use one in office and am thinking of getting one more for home over the ATH-M50 I have. These are way more comfortable for someone with large ears.
B000JPRPAO|4.0|I enjoyed the car chases and the special effects.  It will not win an oscar but it is very entertaining.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|The Kindle Fire HD is perfect for playing Bingo Blitz! Much much better than on much iPhone. I can see  SO much more information on my Kindle, and I can easily play four cards with the larger screen. Bingo Blitz is by far the best Bingo/Slots App available anywhere!!
B002ZG9846|5.0|I bought this movie not knowing what to expect and I can say this might be one of the best blind purchases I've ever made. This movie plays off my silly sense of humor perfectly, if you're the serious, literal, everything has to make perfect sense type this may not be for you. But I think if you're in it for pure entertainment value this is a great movie. The interactions between the characters is perfect and this is the perfect regular guy super hero movie in a time filled with Avengers, Supermans, and Batmans.<br /><br />I just hope that Kick Ass 2 can live up to the first one.
B00EXVZW6E|5.0|BEST HIDDEN OBJECTS GAME I HAVE FOUND.<br />Did I Spy books with my daughter when she was a child. Now I do them with my granddaughter. This Hidden Objects game is the best I have found to date.
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|I went to see this movie in the theater and I'm usually pretty hard to scare, but this movie had me on the edge of my seat several times. I do have to say that most horror movies now are very predictable and there for not scary because you have an idea what's coming before it happens. This movie is different sometimes it builds suspense and nothing happens and other times when you think you have time to catch your breath something crazy happens. I totally believe I got my moneys worth when I chose to see this movie and I can only hope that the blu ray expierence is half as good the theater was.<br /><br />5 stars for sure.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is one of the best games I've ever played. It's really easy to create things and its a really good game if your bored all the time. I highly recommend you get this game.
B009LDCZDC|5.0|One of my favorite shows.  This could be the best set of actors I've ever seen.  I can't wait until season 3 comes out on blu ray.
B0012NVGHU|4.0|Watched the movie years ago. Saw the Broadway show, watched the movie again. The music is haunting. Appreciated the movie version much more after seeing the Broadway production.
B00ET0PZDO|5.0|A lot of fun for my seven yr old child and me to play together. Gets us thinking while having fun.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|If you like Janet Evonovich you'll love twenty-eight and a half reasons! Great writing style.Loved this book.kept me reading wanting more!
B004QX07G4|5.0|Had to find something to occupy my time for a few hrs....this took care of that. It's a fun, witty, and easy read.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|I loved this book so much that I had to buy the next one as soon as I'd finished. It is so well written I couldn't wait to see what happened next. Part of the time I was laughing out loud so hard tears were rolling and then feeling Roses pain and confusion. I haven't started the second but as soon as I'm done here I plan on doing just that;)
B008Y212PI|4.0|The puzzles in this app were challenging enough to keep me engaged, yet simple enough not to be the frustrate me to the point I wanted to uninstall it. Game play was simple and intuitive. I withhold a star because the developer required me to write this review to enter a bonus round. I don't feel that should be a requirement for a paid app.
B00FCR3JQS|5.0|I preordered this and it arrived today.  I absolutely LOVE this book!  It is a wild celebration of humanity in all our diversity. Brandon has  captured poignant moments, a range of moods, tender relationships, and not a few quirky personalities that somehow seem quite normal and delightful. I'm so glad I bought the hard copy. I know I'll enjoy this for years.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Can't view photos and many other things on the TV. I have an iPhone and for now I can only use Netflix and YouTube. I already can get Netflix on the TV, so all this does for now, is YouTube. I guess with that, the $35 price is sort of justified and maybe somewhat overpriced!
B002M9WW30|5.0|A really good movie because the storyline is written really well and the actors performed really well in the movie!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I'm generally pleased with this application. It's always nice to know where your charge stands. I have a similar app on my phone and find it useful.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|had to reinstall app after it shutdown my kindle..many of the items are behind things and you can only tap all over to find the item.  frustrating
B009XIXVU6|4.0|This novel focuses on an Afghan family fractured by a painful decision. Although much of the story transpires in Afghanistan, the family and the story story splinter into California, France, and Greece. Many of the subplots are fascinating, though the last two lose a bit of steam.
B00E0G5S20|5.0|All the song have the power and the fresh air of carcass!!Sadist riffs and the vocal of Jeff kills!!Excellent comeback!!!
B000NGTJTY|1.0|I had no idea this movie would be so violent!  I just knew I like the stars in it.  This is not the fault of the movie, just my preference.  I would not recommend this movie for those folks who like \\"happy\\" movies like me.
B005CRQ3UC|5.0|These books have lasted for years and loved for years in our home. Would recommend it to all families with children
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Must read love every page of this book<br />I have to read the rest of the books I need to read them now
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|This review is based on having watched the film at home with my family on Blu-ray.<br /><br />\\"Star Trek: Into Darkness\\" is the sequel to Director J.J. Abram's 2009 film version of \\"[[ASIN:B002HREH2Q Star Trek [DVD]]]\\" and both are set at about the same time as, or slightly earlier than, the original series but in an alternative timeline. I'm not going to explain more than that because to do so would be a spoiler for the previous film and \\"Star Trek: Into Darkness\\" works best if you have previously watched Abram's first offering. Abrams said that \\"The idea, now that we are in an independent timeline, allows us to use any of the ingredients from the past - or come up with brand-new ones - to make potential stories.\\"<br /><br />He does that many times in this film, which includes a lot of references to the most popular features and characters from the original TV episodes, from the Kirk/Picard voiceover during the title sequence to Tribbles, but you don't have to be a massive Star Trek fan to enjoy it.<br /><br />I would advise against looking up the cast list on the internet before watching the film, because this would give away the identity of the first villain - which was such a closely guarded secret before the film came out that even Benedict Cumberbatch, who performs the part brilliantly, was not told who he was playing until a week after he was cast.<br /><br />I say the first villain because there are more than two sides to the conflict and it is not at all obvious at first who the bad guys are.<br /><br />There is some element of sympathetic parody of the original series, which perhaps can be best illustrated by two quotes from this film. At one point Kirk (Chris Pine) tells his away team<br /><br />\\"Don't set your phasers to stun - their's certainly won't be\\"<br /><br />which rather reminds one of the line attributed to his TOS character in a comic song, \\"We come in peace - shoot to kill!\\"<br /><br />On another occasion Dr McCoy (Karl Urban) asks Kirk \\"Tellme, are you feeling homicidal, power-mad, despotic?\\"<br /><br />Kirk replies: \\"No more than usual.\\"<br /><br />Zachary Quinto is magnificent as Spock (Leonard Nimoy has a brief cameo as Spock's older self), Pine and Urban are equally brilliant as Kirk and McCoy, while Zoe Saldana makes a convincing Uhura and Simon Pegg is an excellent Scotty (it grates slightly that his accent is from a different part of Scotland than James Doohan's was, but never mind.)<br /><br />Special effects are, of course, superb, with the Enterprise managing both to look true to the sixties original and like a magnificently sophisticated creation of the twenty-third century.<br /><br />The film delivers non-stop action and excitement, and anyone who is at all into science fiction is very likely to enjoy it.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Very smart and scary, but not in that jumpy kind of way. It makes you think in a way that is entertaining as a viewer, but doesn't require you to be a writer or movie critic to catch all of the subtleties that make the show great. I highly recommend this series as a whole.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I couldn't put it down. Disappointed that there are only a few levels. The last comments were in June, and no update since :/ Lost starts for lack of levels.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was the perfect mix of funny, sweet, and sad.  I felt about every emotion in reading this book, and once I started I couldn't put it down.  One night when I told myself \\"two chapters and then I'll go to sleep,\\" I ended up staying up until 2am and finished it!  I sometimes work with children with cancer, so (even though it's fiction), it was great to read something from their point of view. Obviously every child deals with cancer differently, but this story was just so beautifully told.  I've been recommending it to everyone since finishing it! I don't know if I will see the movie- when I love a book this much I sometimes like to leave well enough alone and not ruin it with a movie I'll inevitably be disappointed in.  But we'll see.
B00AB55BS0|5.0|It's great. Production values are great. Acting's great. Soundtrack's great. Intro is great. Credits is great. Sean Bean is great. Peter Dinklage is great. Trailers are great. Books are great. Future seasons are great. It's great, y'all. Watch it. Don't troll.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|It's a good application for my kindle fire and my s3 I use it to shop for car parts when I can't get it in the junk yards while I'm out and about.
B000CCBCAS|5.0|Not sure what is so deluxe, but it is at least the original Brit version with Brit cursing, etc. In the American version, some of the language was changed which I as an American find insulting and ridiculous. Love this film and have enjoyed it over and over.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Well I have owned Chromecast for over a month now and I really love the simplicity of the product.  I have several devices that I use for streaming content to my TV's (Xbox, PC..etc.) and Chromecast is by far the easiest to setup and use. I am anxiously awaiting integration into other applications and would love the ability to send photos or local videos from my phone. For the price I would highly recommend.  It will make a great gift for techies and non techies.  Parents were over visiting and showing YouTube content on their iPad so I had to show them the Chromecast.  They ordered from amazon immediately after my demo.  The best part is when you have friends over and want to share videos from YouTube or Netflix everyone can participate and queue up videos.  Now just need Google to open up the api and allow additional functionality.  Come on Google open er up.
B006BFK5DK|4.0|Nice performances from my alltime favorite group. The songs themselves are not sensational, but if you're a fan, it may be worth having.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|super fun and super addictive. easy to catch on and I love the challenges. and the updates are always quick and super cute!
1451613520|5.0|This book covers all the documentaries in the DVD set and in more detail and references to offer. This is a absolute must have with the DVD set. This book will offer more to further explain every subject in greater detail  and to quench your thirst for more information. A+!
B008JFUR10|5.0|i love this movie i saw it in 3D wish i saw in IMAX, if you loved godzilla/gamera movies you will love this, this movie will hold me until godzilla 2014, my only gripe about this movie no godzilla 2014 trailer when at theater
B008JFUR10|5.0|If you love giant fighting robots and giant monsters then this is the movie! It's got that same look of the old Godzilla movies but faster action and more high tech. When I first saw the commercials for this movie I knew this would be a winner for me. If you liked the monster movies from the 60's and 70's you&#34;ll love this movie!
B00F91RYL8|1.0|In my opinion this is the worst movie of Brad Pitts career! The rate of infection & the side effects were the official demise of the movie. All in all it was just a huge let down!
B001XUH69Y|5.0|Excellent classic movie. They just can't make movies like this any more. Hollywood has seen its better days. This one will last forever
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's so cool and cute it was might go to the new class of them eyes and I waswas to be thethe the way the I don't know what is that it will be the first time in the sun was a human rights and I have been awkward and really foolishly yield to go out and I
B00B2YH7D6|5.0|Great documentary about a great studio. I enjoyed hearing the stories & listening to the great music. It also shows where the computer ruined sound city. All in all if you are a fan of music you will love this.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|I hate these games that require energy to play and once your out you have to buy more or wait hours to play again &gt;: 
B00FN811SY|5.0|It is the best ap ever! You can see ip to 5 different Bible  translations at once.aldo it is very fadt.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think that this app is a must have! I have it on all my noble devices and the Xbox and pc version I even have it on my Apple products. It's fun and can be funny lol bold the unthinkable trap friends in holes and play with them lol! You can play alone or with buds'. Try it today! You will be amazed on what you can do!<br />  The best thing to do though is see some one run from them big old spiders lol I also like to lead creepers to my friends homes and watch explode. Zombies are fun too! Lead them to the sun and set them in fire with flint and steal. The scelitons are more fun because the shoot Aries at you so what you do is find a zombie and let him stand near you and the scelitons shoot and they miss you and hit the zombie lol then they fight each other to the death.
0393078299|5.0|This book is a very readable acccount of the thinking and discoveries that led to Quantum mechanics. It connects the people and events along the way to the remarkable concept of quantum behavior. You feel you are watching an encounter and struggle with ideas that challenge the limits of the human mind.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|The game is cute,funny to watch.I haven't played it much. I got it mainly for the grand kids to play.
B004SDEP38|4.0|Handy to have to store documents on the kindle.<br />It is useful to me on a daily basis.  I am a man of few words and a word count bites.
1444777556|5.0|Loving this story. Truly amazing pair. Can't wait for more books. Bob is just about the most amazing cat I have had the pleasure to meet through reading his and James' story.
B00F91RYL8|2.0|Something was missing, really went down toward the end. Just can't put my finger on it, maybe the story was lacking and too much put on the action. Anyway won't be one of those movies you watch again, sorry Brad, try again, you can't get them all ...
1250029465|5.0|What an AWESOME book and truly amazing story! Loved it! Best of luck to James and Bob on future books as well!
B005HED11Y|5.0|As an avid fan of the original series, I was worried that in this &#34;remastered&#34; version would be butchered. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it is very, very well done. It is clear that this was remastered by someone who really understood how the show is supposed to feel.<br /><br />Basically in the remastering they redid a lot of the space scenes and also some special effects, mostly when there are no people on screen. Watching the remastered vs. the original episodes side by side, I found the remastered versions better looking and quietly improved, while still keeping the same spirit and feel as the original special effects.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Its really fun, simple gameplay, but that's not bad. the armors are pretty cool and it can get kinds challenging.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Iv hade my kindle for about a year now and the only thang I do is play this game I love it
B00BRUPICM|5.0|This book definitely kept me on my toes! The sudden story line change will keep you wanting to know more!
0446555002|3.0|Conventional labels are not quite sufficient to describe the Pendergast series, and this installment in particular.  The labels of mystery, thriller, suspense and even fantasy apply, and might be best imagined as four corners of a square. I'm going to label this novel as quite far inside the Fantasy quadrant, even more so than previous Pendergast books. This one requires quite a lot of suspension of disbelief, not only in the plot devices but with character developments that seem illogical to me. As with previous books, there are enough loose ends to fuel a future book (White Fire, release date Nov 12, 2013).
B00B5DWI2O|4.0|Worth buying!! Olafur's music is getting more vibrant and rich. Once you play it, you will be drawn into a deep emotion...
B008Q08IV4|5.0|Great acting and wonderful story weaves through events of the 60s, 70s and 80s. Magical characters teach acceptance of differences.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|The perfect calculator from my seven-year-old. Works great on the Kindle and is easy to use  I would recommend it
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love this show!!  Downton Abbey is a great series. I have watched all the series on Amazon and have enjoyed all of them.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|Almost exactly like Dragon story but has some cool features that my seven-year-old loves like seeing people visit. Lots and lots of in app purchasing opportunities so we'll see if you can really get anywhere in the game without spending all that money
B00DJWV11I|5.0|This book was very funny. Had me laughing out loud at, work, on the road everywhere. I can't wait for the next 2 installments to come out. Sad it won't be until next year :(
B00B9B4IYI|5.0|I just recently started using this product so I can't comment on its longevity, but it is reasonably priced, easy to install and works well per its design.
B00ACBN9CI|4.0|I have the Strike fighters series on my PC, so when this game came out for android I had to get it.<br />Control is intuitive, graphics and gameplay are great fun, the only improvement I would like is to see defence missions against bombers.
B004GXL8GC|5.0|These little guys look alive. You feel like the Smurfs have moved into your home. For play or display these work!
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I love this game !!!!! Any way read the reviews for yourself there all positive and free like I said asome
B00CFYAT6O|4.0|Another good album.  Really like it better than the last one.  The more you listen to it, the better you'll like it.
B009BJAPLK|5.0|Fantastic!!! Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are a great team and the way they bring one of the greatest detectives to the present is brilliant!!
B00DQBWLSO|4.0|Another good album by John Mayer.  He's such a great talent.  Always great music, always great lyrics.  If you take his whole body of work, there's such variety there.  I like that.  Been listening to him since the beginning and always look forward to seeing where he's going next.  Wherever it is, I know it'll be great.
B001EBWIRW|3.0|THE ORIGINAL MOVIE MADE BACK IN 1960 WITH FEW SPECIAL EFFECTS WAS FAR BETTER THAN THIS REMAKE PLAY, EVEN WITH THE ANIMATED PLANT.
B00FGM0IEU|5.0|Being from Alabama and growing up listening to this music, I really enjoyed this movie.  Bought the soundtrack CD, too.  So appreciative to Amazon for making it available in this way.
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|Personally, I thought it was a good, Hollywood-style movie - it was entertaining with good graphics and good acting.  I enjoyed it!  Isn't going to be renowned as the most brilliant movie ever, but who expected it would be?
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I don't use calculators very much so i don't need one sitting around. My kindle is about all the electronics I use so when I did need a calculator i remembered to look in my apps store to see if there was a freebie. Just like when i needed an alarm clock. Very handy and very free.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This author pulls you in from the first page thru to the end. I never (rarely) cry while reading, but I sobbed during several very emotional parts; yet I could not stop reading!<br />Makes me want to read more of this writers books.
B00BDSRKHO|4.0|Even though I was a big fan of this band in the 1980s, I missed hearing their previous &#34;comeback&#34; album, &#34;History of Modern.&#34; But this new release caught my eye recently and I decided to order it. After many listenings, I can safely proclaim that it's caught my ear too. A very impressive album from start to finish. The songs are so good, dripping with that classic OMD sound, that it sounds like the band hasn't lost a beat over the years. Nor have they lost their knack for writing catchy, melodic snyth-pop tunes. This is a like an '80s time capsule exploding in your ears!<br /><br />And those gorgeous vocals remain one of the band's strengths. It sounds like Andy McCluskey has been drinking from the fountain of youth. Really, you'd swear it was a man 20-30 years younger singing these songs. Plenty of good songs on here, and several truly great ones also. Everyone one will have different favorites, another indication of the high quality of tunes on this CD. I think most OMD fans will be thrilled with this new album. I'm very happy to hear OMD making such vibrant music once again.
B003NS1JHY|5.0|One of the best movies I saw growing up in the 90's that got me into the weird west genre.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I give this game five stars. please play this the bubbles are so cool looking nd I just cant get enough of it its very addicting
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It was really good and I liked it alot I liked this book alot there was alot of words in it and it had me at the end of my seat
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|My great grandson's love this game.  Even the 2 years old is learning coordination with aim and control.  The 8 year old say it is a challenge the high up the game you go.  They love Star Wars and they love Angry Birds so with this game they get both and it keeps them quiet because they need to concentrate in order to complete each game. LOVE ANYTHING THAT IS ENTERTAINING TO THE GREAT GRANDCHILDREN!  THANK YOU!
B00FPH6AXE|1.0|Wow where do I start?  The script... Blah.  The props... Looked like they were from a garage sale... They were all flimsy and low budget.  Not even good enough for red box rental.  It was cute to see father and son together again.  I do not recommend movie!
B00D1VKZ3M|5.0|I think a lot of people have been dissapointed that the author didn't follow their personal hopes for how Bridget would live out her life. To enjoy this book, you need to clear all that out of your head and start with a neutral attitude. Once you get past the initial shock of what her situation is, this book is very enjoyable. Yes it is darker and a little more ridiculous, but I think the ridiculousness helps to offset the darker parts. I like how Bridget has in some ways matured, but she also still can't help but fall back to her old ways and fears as we all do from time to time. I was sad at Mark dying, but the way the story is told, you really do want to cheer on Bridget to make it on her own. I say this book is worth a read, but DO NOT stop after only the beginning part, which is the hardest to swallow for old fans I think. It gets better as it goes, I promise!
B003G4W49C|3.0|This is the first Orson Scott Card book I've read, and I think I just don't like his writing style. I am a big fan of the science fiction writers who emphasize SCIENCE. Card isn't a scientist, he's a historian. It shows. This book seemed very fluffy in places, and the end was insanely anticlimactic. About 1/3 of the book is spent discussing the strategies that the kids use while playing a game in zero G. I almost stopped reading in that section because it was so boring. There were a few interesting parts, but nothing ever grabbed me. As another reviewer wrote, it deals with such important and though-provoking topics that it SHOULD be gripping; however, it wasn't for me. It lacks ... heart. It's almost like Card thought these would be interesting subjects to write about, but he has no personal connection or feeling about them, and no personal commentary to make. So, it's OK. Didn't live up to the hype for me. I think I'll go reread the Rama books.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This was a great book and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes wars, history, and, action. I think this is a very well written book and I loved it. Thank you for writing it.
B00AEBB8BK|5.0|Great drama and excellent acting by Jim Carrey.  Also, the script and originality of the theme deserves a special mention.
160774273X|3.0|The book was not quite complete. For example to make a sour dough starter It was left out what for water to use. In my experience only bottled water worked, because it has no chlorine in it Chlorine kills the bacteria you want to create in a starter. I was left struggling for years to build a starter until I came across the Bread Bible which explained it so nicely. My starter is now nearly 9 years old and very powerful. Certainly you have to feed it every 10 days. I do not waste half of it as the book advices. I just add to it, and when I have enough to make two batches of bread  I bake. Certainly I safe a handful for next time. Anybody out there needs help. I will gladly give it.<br />Ursula
B008RC72G8|3.0|I am a a fan of the original (and the best) Dark Shadows with Jonathan Frid as Barnabas. Even though Tim Burton and Johnny Depp are reverent followers of the series, this film  at best, has its moments.  The storyline tried to hard to incorporate too many things and the result is this &#34;campy&#34; version. There are some nice touches but I wish that they had taken a somewhat different approach to this iconic vampire story.
B00A7YZ1KI|2.0|After all we have been through! I'm sorry but that was just lame as an end to the series. Just didn't gel or feel right
B00006JDVV|4.0|Cameo appearance by a young Gerard Butler. Christian Bale before he became Batman but Matthew McConaughy steals the movie in this futuristic rendition of a world consumed by dragons.  He even shaved his head for the role.  Worth watching.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|Dr. Perlmutter knows what he is talking about. I followed his recommendations from his last book to help recover from meningitis. Now I have real reasons to change my diet and hopefully circumvent my greatest fear- Alzheimer's disease.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I agree with the recommendations of so many others.  This is fun to play and it gets more challenging as you get better.
0425170349|4.0|VIntage Tom Clancy.  Haven't read one of his books in quite a while, as I thought they had become too techncial.  May pick up again.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this game.  Play it to relax several times a day. It fills in my downtime to keep me from getting bored.
B00DV3A84G|5.0|This is my favorite CD of the year. I love it! Love the sounds, the voices, the words. I don't love the CD cover, which is difficult to read, but that is a minor quibble. The songs are haunting, melodious, important, and resonant. I hear ghosts of 80s (the Fixx, Roxy Music, Flock of Seagulls)  in the music, which is a compliment and the ghosts are subtle and reminiscently reinterpreted so the music really is fresh and fervently current. I recently heard a radio DJ say Bastille is getting a lot of critical acclaim and they have the potential to be the most important newcomers this year and I believe that.
B009EHDU7U|4.0|interesting story of the old guy's life and adventures culminating in those in his 101st year. An enjoyable and amusing read.

1250038820|5.0|I first discovered HONY through the Facebook group many moons ago and became a regular visitor to the page thereafter and to this day. Of course, I pre-ordered this book as soon as I heard about it and I received it yesterday, (Oct. 15, 2013). Brandon Stanton's work is truly amazing, inspiring, and engrossing to see. Most of Brandon's photos tell their own story, but they are frequently accompanied by statements from the diverse subjects of the photos, or short interviews. More often than not, this accompanying text elevates the visual to something more - whether it be a snippet of wisdom, an interesting anecdote, something poignant, funny, sad or tragic, or just a line or two that opens a window into the soul of a real person.<br /><br />Rarely does something make such an impact in my old, jaded eyes. This book, (and the whole HONY project), has gone a long way to restore my faith in humanity. That really is no exaggeration. This is a wonderful book.
B002BCNK1Q|3.0|A lot of unnecessary profanity. The moral of the movie resonates great with me. Great for dealing with individual biases and prejudice.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I chose this rating because from the beginning to end I stayed on the edge of my seat. It's a mix of romance, tragedy and thriller. The only thing I didn't like is the big predictable thing is that Katniss will win the Games. Other then that I loved the book!

B0031P4FFM|5.0|The books have a great story line, and plenty of twists that keep you on the edge of your seat. It is extremely fast paced and there is plenty of action (for the guys) and some romance (for the girls). All in all this is a series that you have to read!

B00F2362IE|1.0|It is forever &#34;loading!&#34; The game itself is pretty boring and it runs very slow. I have plenty of space on the kindle, but it may run smoother on iPad. Definitely not worth the $3.99 we paid! :(
B00DW3X07M|5.0|I didn't even know about this album until a week ago. A friend posted a video from the recording session on Facebook and I knew I had to buy it. I am not a drummer but Virgil Donati is my favorite drummer to listen to. I love the way he plays. And the other musicians on this album are fantastic!
B000091NQY|1.0|This vinyl record came to me in poor packaging and because it was not labeled &#34;do not fold&#34; or &#34;do not bend&#34; the Post Office carrier folded it over and stuffed it into my mailbox!<br /><br />Should have been packaged in such a way that it could not be bent as well as labeled clearly to not do so on the outside of the package.<br /><br />Only minor objections from the seller before being able to return it for this reason.

B008OJ291W|2.0|Can't say I'm a fan of this remake edition.  I was hoping I would like it at least as much as the original releases but it just doesn't work for me.  Guess I just like the originals too much even if they aren't as clean sounding compared to this one with the use of newer technology.
B00E3QJ7ZG|4.0|Very glad I waited for this to come out in Blu-ray and wondering why it's taken so long compared to other Eastwood films in his &#34;Man With No Name&#34; sub-genre. Eastwood's 2nd directorial effort (shortly after Play Misty for Me), it's not quite as good in plot (storyline) as &#34;Outlaw Josie Wales&#34; or &#34;Pale Rider&#34; which came years later, but only by a little as it's still a good tale. The cinematography and his directing are quite strong. There's plenty of action and enough depth to the story to keep interest. It has the typical gunslinger stranger arrives to town in extremis (or about to be) from a gang of ruthless ruffians. However, this one has a significant twist that the town's &#34;elders&#34; have brought the situation upon themselves (any more about this would be a major spoiler). Everyone pretty much gets their just deserves by the end; there is Karma.<br /><br />This film was a sufficient enough break from the traditional &#34;Western&#34; (as epitomized by John Ford's films) that it prompted John Wayne to write Eastwood a letter telling him this film did NOT represent the 19th Century American West, its values or its traditions. Perhaps Wayne had dismissed the Sergio Leone &#34;Dollars Trilogy&#34; that preceded this, and their popularity, as aberrant foreign Italian-Spanish imports (it had been some number of years)? What about Sam Peckinpah's &#34;The Wild Bunch&#34; released four years earlier? Perhaps it wasn't &#34;Western&#34; enough. In any event, Eastwood's &#34;High Plains Drifter&#34; is one of the films that continued to break down the 1930's-60's traditional Western genre, redefining it with Bad Men that aren't totally Bad, and Good Guys that had their own significant flaws. Critically acclaimed when released, it's well worth seeing, as it was part of the continuing evolution of the &#34;Man With No Name&#34; Western sub-genre.
B007SY3CEW|5.0|I love this app. Always wanted to take piano lessons and didn't.  This is a great a way to feel like I a m a great piano player. :) Hoping  for more additions soon.
B00CL151G4|5.0|I started watching this show from the beginning and loved it!  Jonny Lee Miller is great at being a lovable a_ _ and Lucy Liu is brilliant as Watson.  I was an AA Sponsor for years and they stay true enough to that part of life that it gets the message across The entire cast is great, the stories are both intriguing and funny as they solve cases in their own unique way.  Highly recommended!
B004WCTLNY|5.0|I love the movie...I know its not to far from the truth and sometimes you wish you could tell someone to really understands...not that you don't take responsibility for your actions but THERE ARE FORCES WORKING. Like example why is it when you found a nice girl/or girl finds a guy there ex calls..texts around the same time not just any one but the one that could be the one but their not sure. just like in the movie. This has happen too many times to be a coincidence its happen about over 10 times I say not. NO Its NOT DUMB LUCK has mostly happen to with their ex calling or why is it when you have someone boyfriend/girlfriend guys or girls know this..then they come out the wood works everyone wants you then but when your not with anyone they don't AND NO ITS NOT BECAUSE YOUR CONFIDENCE IS HIGH..ive seen to many strange things this scenario is also in the movie...I knew these things before the movie and i ve kinda always looked For the path to go I'm an great observer..truthfully that has always kept me out of the most trouble. I will even go into greater detail \\"there are people I knew were no good for me times in my life\\" reason I know is they were not good influence for my good or love me in that way but I wanted to be with them for whatever reason..then I've watched almost like counter intellegents on that relationship..examples the appearance of cheating...I did not cheat on them...but they see my phone an ex on there, they bump into me after I bump into ex so it looks like something, or their friends give them the wrong information's to influence their decisions'anything you could think of to influence the relationship in negative way happen...so when the guy they liked called..its more appealing.. I HAVE SO MANY examples greater than these but these I know some can relate to.....I love the movie so I think itst because it plants the seed FOR people to look at it again and because you have not experienced this by yourself<br />Beloved, think it is not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, though some STRANGE thing happen to you!<br />If you you like movies that challenge you,gives you something different, creative, makes you think about life decisions love, has beautiful romance, entertains you this one is it!!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I<br />like this game it keeps . You focus try it it works for me share with a friend or play with a family member
0316204366|5.0|Man oh man, read some of the one star reviews and you'll see what happens when you write about things like forgiveness, God and other biblical things.<br />I enjoyed Gladwell's other books, but I had no idea he had any biblical background. With all the science and humanistic views, I assumed him to be another atheistic Einstein or Sagan.<br />It is refreshing to hear stories that cast a shadow on all the confused social crusades we have been conducting for the past few decades.<br />As he points out, the ideas seemed good at first, but without the correct focus in seeing ahead, the results have the opposite outcome, such as in classrooms and jails.<br />Great insight into some of our recent history too and how we can move forward with discretion and proper determination,<br />rather than getting locked into logical 'religious' programs that ultimately destroy progress and end up causing more problems.<br />It shows that getting too 'liberal' in society is as bad as all out, mindless 'conservative' justice and uniform punishment,<br />all when done outside of love.<br />Gladwell shows that love is always triumphant, whether it is how students are loved, criminals are loved or the enemies who have invaded your country are loved.<br />If your are full of hatred, revenge, are  unforgiving and Godless falling for every seemingly logical idea that some deceived individual committee or group puts forward,<br />because it sounds good for all humanity, you won't like this book.<br />But if you are interested in human stories which prove that thoughtful love can champion over mindless or organized aggression,<br />you might just cheer for the underdog here and read this book. (Or listen to Malcolm read it himself on Audible).
B004X4R3FE|5.0|I know a lot about WW2 but had not heard this story. I thought the actors were very good and the story held my interest completely. A self taught man was able to make a huge difference in helping a leader in his  Country in a time of need.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This app has a ton of little games. Each set has its own games which cost a certain amount of coins to unlock which you earn from playing the unlocked games. Pretty fun.
0307276902|5.0|Interesting and makes you look at addiction. I've never had an issue with addiction so it's hard for me to fully understand. No one can unless they've been there. I think this book brings someone as close as they can get to understanding.

B0089LOG02|5.0|The story line pulls you in at the very beginning and continues to keep you on the edge of your seat hoping &#34;Dorothy&#34; finds a good home.  It also is fascinating as to how she became the woman she is today.

B0014JKJHK|1.0|I bought an 8 because typically I'm a 7-7.5, well my mother who is a 9 fits in these. Very upset. I would return these if my mom didn't actually wear them. Still, a waste of money.<br />I wore them the first night I got them with thick fuzzy socks and the backs up (only way they would fit) and I work in a restaurant for 10 hours some times... They gave me three blisters in 8 hours! My mom wore them for work (she does not work on her feet) and she even got a blister.<br />I really wish I could return these.<br /><br />My danskos and Sanitas are much better.. Invest guys! These suck!
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|I'm sorry. I normally try to sound erudite and intelligent, but here all I can say is: this is some of the most beautiful modern literature I've read.  God, what an exquisite book.  Equal to Gone With the Wind. Thank you.  I laughed and cried and-what an amazing gift.

B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I don't know how he does it but as long as he writes I will read.  He is truly the King.  I have yet to find a writer who can take ordinary people and places and write a story that not only can scare the hell out of you but make it so fascinating that you can't stop reading. I have been hooked on King for many years and wish I had half his talent.  He is a master of his craft.
B00BMR4RIG|5.0|This is an excellent app works better than the IPhone weather app. I would definitely recommend this app to anyone from early risers wondering wether to wear long sleeves or short sleeves, to people wanting to camp without bad weather.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I learned a lot about Nikola Tesla. To me he's like Albert Einstein is to scientists and other people. I've looked up to him for 5 years now learning about him and that may not sound like a long time to some but of course I'm only 14. But anyway I've learned more about Nikola Tesla in this book then in the 5 years of researching him.
B00486070K|1.0|I bought this product for my pc because it has a bad wifi connection, when it arrived i plugged it into my pc and nothing happened. the reason why it didn't work is because i checked the packaging, it is only compatible with the 2013 mac book air. it doesn't say anywhere on amazon that it is very limited.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Great start to the new season. Good to see Rick semi sane. And the rest of the cast still going strong. I hate that the governor is still lurking somewhere. They need to hurry up and get rid of him. You go Michon!

0143038419|3.0|Leaving behind the outward marks of success, the author of [[ASIN:0143038419 Eat, Pray, Love: One Woman's Search for Everything Across Italy, India and Indonesia]] committed herself to a year of self-discovery.  A journey away from the emotional pain of her divorce and a broken relationship afterwards...toward a spiritual awakening.<br /><br />She divided the year into increments, beginning in Italy, where she would enjoy the pleasures and sensory experience of eating.  And practice her Italian.  In India, she lived in an Ashram and devoted herself to the art of meditation, in order to connect with her spirituality.  And the final leg of her journey would be in Bali, where she hoped to find balance.<br /><br />I must admit that I had some fascination for the story, and how devoted the author was to her quest.  And I enjoyed following her journey through the months in Italy.  The experiences in India bored me...and I could not relate to them, try as I would.<br /><br />Bali felt a little more like a time of connecting to others, as she helped families and people she met there, and formed lasting relationships.<br /><br />Sometimes our journeys in life yield just what we need.  And sharing them with others can help them.  But that didn't happen for me with this book, which I almost gave up on several times.  However, I must say that the book is well-written, and sometimes for several pages in a row, I could engage with it.  But not enough to recommend it to anyone other than those who are on a similar quest.  Therefore, I'm awarding it three stars.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This is a well told story of a family enduring slavery and the different phases of acceptance.  The cast of characters are believable and lovable.  You can empathize with how trapped and helpless they can feel at times.  You can relate to Lavinia's perspectives as a child and then that of an adult.  I find myself rooting for a happy outcome for anyone.  It must have been such a difficult existence in that age and location.  Really no one came out unscathed.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|This sleeper that most people haven't heard of is a masterpiece drama. The English have really made a blockbuster with this one.
B0063GORYU|5.0|this is a neat twist on an old game. It's fun to pass the time with. will definitely be more challenging as other options are added
B007EVQAFC|3.0|I have been a huge fan of Alice Cooper for many, many years, and I wish I could say this was a brilliant album.  The setlist is okay, and it's really great to see &#34;Muscle of Love&#34; and &#34;Clones&#34; make an appearance, but they' too, are marred by the sound quality of this release.  To me, it sounds like it's a bootleg taken from the soundboard, and not mixed very well at that.  The bass notes are way too overpowering and distract from the songs.  On the performance side, Alice sounds a little rough here... often like he's shouting rather than following the melody.  There are some good things about this release, but overall it is average, and I would not recommend it for anybody except completest-type fans.
B00866H7SS|3.0|It was a short read that did not take to much concentration, but I did want to continue on too find out what happened next!
006114665X|5.0|If you have always wondered how World War I got started this book will give you more details than you thought possible.<br /><br />The title is somewhat misleading because the European powers did not sleepwalk into World War I.  The years leading up to the war were full of war talk, war threats, war preparations, various small wars, and countless crises and confrontations.  What the European powers sleepwalked into was a long and catastrophic war they did not expect because they each thought it would be a short war with themselves victorious.  The author admits this at the end but the title suggests otherwise as does conventional wisdom.<br /><br />But the proximate cause of the war was Serb nationalism.  Serbia was formed at the end of the Dark Ages when countries like England, France, and Germany were being formed and modern Europe began taking its present form.  But during the Middle Ages the Turks began advancing northward and the Serbs suffered a major defeat in 1389 at the Battle of Kosovo.  Eventually Serbia and the rest of the Balkans were incorporated into the Ottoman Empire.<br /><br />During the modern era the Ottoman Empire began weakening and Serbia as well as other countries such as Bulgaria and Romania became independent due to Turkish losses from the Russo-Turkish War of 1878.  Then in the First Balkan War of 1912, Serbia and other Balkan countries gained more territory from the Ottoman Empire.  In the Second Balkan War of 1913, the victors fought amongst themselves over captured Ottoman territory.<br /><br />As a result of all this, Serbia almost doubled in size and began approaching its medieval size, known as Greater Serbia.  Meanwhile, other nearby Slav states such as Croatia, Slovenia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina were part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.  Some of their territories had been part of medieval Greater Serbia.  Flush with their victories, Serbs began agitating against the Austro-Hungarian Empire, especially for Bosnia-Herzegovina which contained many Bosnian Serbs.<br /><br />All this led to a plot by Bosnian Serbs operating out of Serbia to assassinate the Austrian Archduke (heir to the throne) who was coming to Bosnia on a goodwill tour.  The assassins were the usual terrorist formula: they were young, unemployed, idealistic, and inexperienced.  They were sponsored by the Black Hand, a Serbian terrorist organization which had penetrated the Serbian government and military.  Like all terrorists they despised any reformer like the Archduke who was trying to lessen tensions by giving the Slav provinces more autonomy.<br /><br />On June 28, 1914, the Archduke and his wife were assassinated in Sarajevo, Bosnia.  This started the July Crisis where Europe had already formed into two opposing coalitions.  There was the Triple Entente comprising the established imperial powers of Britain, France, and Russia.  Opposing them was the Triple Alliance (aka the Central Powers) of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire.<br /><br />Austria first sent an ultimatum to Serbia.  The main demands were that a joint Austro-Serbian effort supress subversive movements in Serbia and investigate the role of Serbians in the assassinations.  These demands seem moderate today but they were deemed extreme at the time.  The author explains that the NATO demand of 1990 that Yugoslavia open all of its territory to NATO forces was much more extreme.<br /><br />The Third Balkan War then started when Austria and Serbia mobilized their forces with Austria going only into partial mobilization (Balkan forces only).  Russia in its role as big brother protector of the Balkan Slavs went into a partial mobilization.  Austria declared war on Serbia after receiving an equivocal reply to its ultimatum.  Russia responded by going into full mobilization.  This turned a Balkan war into World War I as Germany, Austria-Hungary, and France went into full mobilization.  Britain then mobilized its expeditionary force when Germany would not guarantee the neutrality of Belgium.<br /><br />It is ironic that all the major powers were acting defensively.  Austria was reacting to Serb terrorism.  Russia was protecting Serbia.  Germany was protecting Austria.  France was supporting Russia while Britain was protecting France and Belgium.<br /><br />While Europe was a powder keg in 1914, it had been so for decades.  It was the assassination in Sarajevo that sparked World War I.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This was my first time reading a book by Liane, so wasn't sure what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised.  Loved how the character's lives all connected together.  And how she told the story from different points of view.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this book!

B00BTYP6QE|5.0|The game is simple enough for a child but develops into a more challenaging game if you want to receive all the starts and the highest poitns for hte level. The game gets progressively harder with each level. The main character is cute for any age.

B007U1FEJE|4.0|The Beach Boys are back and they sound great. I miss Carl like all BB fans but the harmonies are still fine. Brian still knows how to create those catchy tunes and it really turns the mind back to those days of the 60s were life was simple and the music was fresh and original. Unfortunately as good as the album is, and I have listened to it a number of times, I am no longer 19 and there is nothing we haven't heard before. Brian \\"going steady\\" just doesn't sound right or am I just a grumpy old fan. It's a great return to form but I can still see the wrinkles!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I read this book because it was on a list  of recommended books of the General Federation of Women's Clubs.  While the book does end (spoiler alert) with her leaving Christian Gray because he cannot give her what  she wants (and she cannot give him what he needs), I was relieved to see her go in order to give herself back to herself.  There are 50 different sides (shades) to Mr. Gray, none of which include self-love so the beast cannot accept the love of beauty.  Give this a read if you like squirming.

B004GHNH7Q|5.0|This review is specific to the Kindle edition of the book.<br /><br />It is suprisingly difficult to find critical essays on To Kill a Mockingbird.  This book is a gold mine of multiple critical views, each exploring some aspect of the book.  As so many of the people that scored this product with only one or two stars have stated, it is NOT the actual novel.  The title should make that plain.  If not, the product discription states that &#34;Michael J. Meyer has assembled a collection of new essays that celebrate this enduring work of American literature. These essays approach the novel from educational, legal, social, and thematic perspectives.&#34;  A hasty purchase without reading either the product title or the description should not translate into a low score for the product.<br /><br />That said, I will be using this book for research as an M.A. Literature student and am thrilled to find such a wide variety of critical approaches in a single volume. The book is relatively current (2010) and contains fifteen critical essays grouped into four broad areas of approach.<br /><br /> I've just started sampling the contents, but can already say that the navigation appears to be friendly if not fantastic. The table of contents allows the various essays to be accessed directly.  One excellent perk of the Kindle edition (used with the free laptop Kindle reader) is the inclusion of the specific Kindle reference information pasted directly into a Word document immediately below any cut/pasted text.<br /><br />This book is primarily intended as either a research resource for college level students or by advanced readers familiar with literary criticism who wish to gain a deeper appreciation for Harper Lee's master work. In case you missed it, this is NOT the novel.

0307730700|5.0|How do I review a book like this? <br /><br />Adam Brown overcame all odds to fulfill what he felt was his divine calling in life. His faith in God was his fuel to overcome his addiction and fight for human rights and dignities in the capacity of a Navy Seal. This book will renew your faith in God and his plan for his children. It will renew your faith in American and our military. This may be as close as one can come to understanding what it means to be in the military without having direct personal experience. It makes me a little sick inside to stop and think about the things that our military has to endure in order to protect our way of life. <br /><br />The author does a good job following the life of Adam Brown to bring him alive to the reader. Adam stands as an example of the many American heroes who lose their lives in action. What makes Adam special was his refusal to quit or walk away. Despite all the opportunities and excuses to stop, quit, or walk away he had a mission in life and he was committed to fulfilling that purpose.<br /><br />Read this book and it will change you.
B0010SKTRA|5.0|Should be required reading in schools. Would help get rid of superstitions, Tea Parties and other ailments of society. Keep up the good work.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I read it because of the buzz around it, but honestly I found it disappointing. Bad written, plain characters, improbable situations; almost ridiculous. I don't know why women found it so enjoyable or why did they fell in love with Christian Grey, that character is so unlikable: possesive, controlling, rude, etc. The only good thing are his over-admired beauty. OK, we got that he's gorgeous, there's no point in reminding us about it over and over. It's a waste of time and if you want a real &#34;heroin&#34;, read Austen or Bronte, cause Anastasia is just annoying.

B00DYVU9K8|4.0|Being a fan of Sofia Coppolla, I got this film to see her latest wks. It was interesting watching these Hollywood rich girls trying to be gangsters. They made it look so simple going into Celebs homes, and robbing them.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|I not only think this is a great show, I believe that it is also very informative. I love the fact that the show has drama every episode you just dont want to miss!
B00DHRLK84|5.0|Love Zombie films, the CGI was a bit much on this film, but it kept pace with todays interpertation of the Zombie Apocalypse.
B00DAXXO98|5.0|I think this is one of the TV shows that really gets me. It has that political drama, manipulation, and black humor. It is just a great TV show.. very sarcastic!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This is my first real gaming mouse so I don't have much to compare it to, but what I can say is it works fantastically for what I need. The buttons are all very easy to push without having any mistaken clicks so far. The cord is plenty long and seems to be very sturdy and I love the customization. The weight tuning cartridges really helped me adjust quicker to this mouse over my last one.<br /><br />The only thing I will say is that the key binding is a bit weird in that you can't bind keys straight from a game. You've got to bind each mouse button to a keyboard key, which you then bind in game. Example, for the three thumb buttons, I've got them bound to N, M, and \\",\\" and then in my game, I've got to bind my actions to N, M, and \\",\\" in order to use them. It's not a big deal, it's just a little bit of a hassle. Five stars.
B00E9E4EC8|5.0|I really enjoy Allen Jackson's voice; This C.D has a lot of great songs and in the keeping with the spirit of true blue grass tone has a lot of banjo and Fidel. Thank You Allen, for keeping it real.
B004LOMB2Q|2.0|To make it short and sweet... Perhaps this is a great application (though it looks & feels like a lot of eye-candy for functions already on my Kindle Fire HD).<br /><br />I won't really know 'cause I'm not running any app with permissions to use my personal info so freely. Apparently thousands of users find it acceptable. I don't. Uninstalled.
B00CMQX84A|1.0|My kids love this movie.. but when got it they put it in dvd player and it didn't work. Have to buy again:(
0307271080|3.0|Ifemelu the main protagonist. A singularly most self centered, self absorbed, superior, sneering, scornful,  enterprising character, with simmering disguised arrogance.  Blaine  and Curt were used, Obinze misused, the other characters florally arranged.<br /><br />The book seems to me an opportunity for the author to purge her worldly observations, opinions,  in a very cleverly crafted manner. Is the book truly fiction, written without an audience in mind as the author has claimed? It feels in places autobiographical.<br /><br />The immigrant experience was exceptionally done. The hair dressing  scenes engrossing.<br /><br />This is not a love story.  The morally dubious Ifemelu gets to eat, and keep the cake!<br /><br />The glimpses of Nigerian society is narrow, shallow, stereotypical,  perpetuation of common perceptions of the `been to's' and  the unimaginable easily acquired wealth.<br /><br /> I would love to see a  really detailed critique by a black African American, and their response to the dissection of the race issues in America.<br /><br />CNA is a master craft writer,  kept me hooked, even though there were impulses  to skim and  put the book down.<br /><br />What the hell is NAB?<br /><br />I loved the first two books of the author,  I look forward to the next.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This game was fun. Only pitfall was a lack of directions. A hint option would be helpful. Was not to hard to be able to enjoy. Was slightly addictive so ran through rather quickly.
B003G4W49C|5.0|A fantastic story of interstellar battles, politics, and the struggle for peace, both personal and global. At once beautiful and terrifying. Highly recommended for readers of all ages.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|Came on time and good condition. I remember watching this movie as a kid and now i get to share it with my kids. Memories and family time.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|My wife tell me about this program, and I am really, really impress, and I like´t a lot. Thank You
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's about time they made this for the kindle Fire. My gf has been wanting it forever. Thanks for finally making it.
B005LAII12|5.0|Ted is a great movie with some of the best writers.  It keeps you laughing from start to finish and everyone that grew up in the generation depicted can have a nice trip through memory lane.  Highly recommend.
B005WKKI96|5.0|This is a &#34;must have&#34; selection of songs with international seasoning, to bring zest to your listening pleasure.<br />If you ever have the opportunity to attend a live Lila Downs performance, you will have an uplifting musical experience.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great game, only Down side is wireless fades in and out and u have to start all over when u get an update of new phone..
0345529057|5.0|What can you say about this series that hasn't already been said? I've read the first 3 books and it keeps getting better. I'm trying to put off reading the next one so I don't go through them so fast.
0762445262|1.0|For the $13 I spent on this item (including S&H), this was not a good value.  The kit came in a manila envelope and had obviously been crushed in transit--you'd think this item could be shipped fairly cheaply in a cardboard box, to avoid damage to the shipment.  Apparently the shipper wasn't concerned about the integrity of the kit, so the container is crumpled.  I checked the inside components, and got what I expected, a mini bat signal with accompanying book.  I realize this item is a novelty gift, and feel it was represented appropriately in the listing; I just wish the shipper had taken reasonable precautions, such as packaging the kit in a sturdier container, to ensure that my shipment would have made it to me without damage.  I would recommend going elsewhere if you're looking for this item or similar novelty gifts.
B005LJITS0|2.0|This movie probably unfairly gets scathing reviews, but that doesn't mean it is great.  It is just not that good.
B0070YDOT8|5.0|Woohoo!! I love this game :) I'm addicted to Roulette and Blackjack!!  Wish I would have found this game sooner!!
0783226063|5.0|I like the book and i also liked the movie. Frank Hurbert wrote the book and the movie was a close second
B000KKPN5C|1.0|Hi. I bought this flash unit because I was left with a little budget after buying a camera (D7000) and an extra lens (50mm f/1.8). At the moment I couldn't afford something more expensive so i went for this as it was a bargain for $ 120 and apparently had nothing to break, only a power switch.<br /><br />I received it the first days of september and 2 weeks later it stopped working. I almost used it exclusively at home, mostly family use. Now I'm outside the US (South America) and Nikon doesn't want to take it for a service, even if I pay for it. Nikon policy is terrible when it comes to original products bought in other country than the one you're in. They treat you as hell, almost like if you did something illegal for taking your photo equipment from one country to another.<br /><br />Now I must send it to the US, the shipment is going to cost more than the flash itself. Nikon user experience is really really decieving.<br /><br />I can't write further about the usefulness of this unit because it worked for so little time and I don't have enough shots to evaluate.
B0055S348W|5.0|Got this for a couple Android tablets. Needed to print but there's no drivers with Android. This program finds the printer over a network, WIFI or USB connection and handles the drivers. A very handy program to have.
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|.One of the best time management games of all time. Challenging and fun and worth playing multiple times.  Exciting to finally have it on a mobile device
B00F35BV64|4.0|Very exciting (as block busters have to be), lots of action and plot twists (so is great to watch on an exercise bike), but totally absurd.<br />Spock has to hand carry a bomb into a molten volcano? Really?<br />They send Uhura to capture the badass Khan? Ok.<br />Kind of miss the imaginative exploration (their mission?) of the original series, but at least they gave it 10 minutes in this film.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|the game is really fun and entertaining but i am highly dissapointed by the fact that when i battle el macho the game freezes EVERY TIME. other than that it is five stars!!! :)
0307711773|5.0|My children and I love to listen to audio books in the car and Riordan is one of our favorite Authors.  The Audio version of this new series is well produced and the story just as fun as all the other Riordan stories!  I think that if I had a quibble, it would be that the voice talent is a new one for the series and he does the female voices of Annabeth and Thalia a bit stilted and flat, as if he isn't sure who these characters are yet.  However, he does have a good range of voices and really brings the story to life.  It is a testament to both the talent of the Author and the Reader that when we get to our destination the kids don't want me to turn the car off so they can hear some more of the story!
B005LAIIMG|3.0|I was really excited to get this but frankly was not all the hype made it out to be. Would wait and buy at the pawn shop for 3 bucks if I were you. Its worth a look just not 15 bucks worth.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I've read all of Flynns novel.  It brings to mind today's world events and sometimes I think &#34;Where is Mitch Rapp when you need him?&#34;
B00AZMFJYA|3.0|No where near as good as the last one. As usual Hollywood cashes in on the first ones popularity and phones it in on this one. Another wait for the 5 dollar walmart bin or get it for 3 bucks at the old pawn shop.
B008FRFN7A|2.0|Unfortunately I still have not been able to print out anything with this app, and the so-called &#34;Help&#34; section is no help at all. If anyone can provide assistance, please sing out!
B003G4W49C|5.0|This was a great read! The story is unique and entertaining. I would recommend it to anyone, at any age.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was an easy read but it doesn't mean that it isn't meant for adults as well. This is a great book for any age. I cried, I laughed, and I loved.
0385528787|3.0|This book follows the same format as the other two before it.  A story line which takes you back through the past of one of the main characters (Zeb in this case) mixed with the happenings of the present.  I found Zeb's story a bit more interesting than the rest but nothing that much more exciting that what was told in the past.  All in all a good series which is interesting an a sci-fi way but if you're looking for more of a post-apocalyptic read where you see the end of the world this isn't really that type of book.
B005LAIIJY|3.0|I was intrigued initially by the actors who played the roles. This was a strong movie, lagged just slightly in places. The acting was excellent. They gave you a character to love/hate. It was a twisted role and story line that actually worked. The special effects were a little clumsy, but not bad. The ending was good, but the period of show that created the ending was the best. I hated to see a favored character exit, but what an exit he made. Perfect. I would recommend. It was worth watching and I would watch it again. Definitely one to keep. Enjoy.
B00EO4SBSG|4.0|Trivium is a special band in my eyes. They have managed to make each an every album sound vastly different from the next. Some people might find that to be a bad thing, but even if I am not a huge fan of the music, it is a quality I can really respect.<br /><br />With Vengeance Falls, they once again outdid themselves from a musicians standpoint. Frontman Matt Heafy stated in an interview before the release of the album that it consisted of everything they had done right in the past. I could not agree more with this statement. The album is chock full of brilliant riffs that could have come from various eras of the band. The one thing that changed the most is what typically changes most on Trivium's albums; Heafy's vocals. Some might argue that David Draiman had major influence on the vocals, which I can hear and understand, but that is not necessarily a bad thing unless you are a metal elitist that hates anything and everything related to Disturbed.<br /><br />A trend that has been going from their first album on for me, only to be broken by In Waves, is the last track on the album being my absolute favorite. Wake (The End is Nigh) is a masterpiece. This song alone easily bests anything on In Waves, which I thought was their most generic core album. Some other tracks that really tickle my fancy are Incineration, the title track, and Villainy Thrives.<br /><br />So basically, I believe that if you are a huge fan of Shogun like I am, then this album probably suits what you are looking for more than In Waves. But, it still lacks the thrash element that has me hooked on Shogun to this day. Give it a try. Always listen to an album with an open mind and you might be surprised at what you end up liking.
B005WUHAX8|2.0|I bought this case from another supplier. I paid $85 at the time. I did drop the phone once, from at least 3-4 ft onto concrete and it was undamaged. That is the PRO. My CON for it is that you can't use anything other than an APPLE charger with this case on. The after market chargers/connectors are just ever so slightly too big and won't work. It's truly a design flaw. I hate it. I shouldn't have to pay Apple prices for accessories because I bought a case for my phone to protect it. I don't know if Lifeproof gets some sort of monetary value from doing it, but it's irritating in the extreme. If I had known I would never have bought this case. I would NOT recommend buying it. There are other cases that are cheaper and work just as well that don't restrict the use of which charger/connector you use. If you HAVE to have a Lifeproof, be prepared to order only APPLE products for it.
B008YUNDJS|5.0|This led me to the Harvard Negotiation Programs Executive Education Course, which was one the most transformative experiences I've had. The book challenges the convention of argumentative negotiation. Instead it promotes the notion of informed dialogue focused on satisfying interests above pointless and counter-productive positioning. It is the very embodiment of Churchillian &#34;jaw-jaw above war-war.&#34;
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I gave it 3 stars as I am still trying to figure out how to play the game.<br />i have only played it for a few days.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Maybe is to late, understanding, the mysteries of woman brain,but I'll keep learning. .I think can be a great movie.
B009O2XY12|5.0|Hours and hours of fun!  It is also a challenge to try to win every time, which isn't possible ALL the time...that makes it addicting!  Be careful, though, you may not get anything else done for playing so much!!!  ^ _ ^
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was sure I knew where thus book would lead but I couldn't have been mire wrong. I thought The Hunger Games was a great read but Catching Fire was so far above it I don't have the words. I can't wait to get my hands on the final instalment of this series!
B000002KXO|4.0|Not as good as TUSK, but hey, it's Fleetwood Mac. Hold Me and Gypsy are still two of my favorites.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|My seven year old absolutely loves this game. Keeps her focused on something else besides the Disney channel. Very fun!
B00F4KGJRO|5.0|Wonderful harmonies, solid picking and timeless stories told by Alan Jackson.  He is a prolific song writer and this adds another layer of depth to his incredible career.  Echoing others who have provided comments I hope AJ follows this album up with another bluegrass effort.
190949013X|5.0|Beautifully written, alternating between the voices of Payton and Kendall, this book gripped me from the first page, the characters staying with me long after the book ended. Also, this book manages to do what very few books achieve- it tells a great story and keeps you entertained while at the same time dealing with many of the issues facing young people today: the subject of identity- daring to accept who you are as well as finding the courage to bare yourself to those closest to you, taking the chance that you might lose them in the process; choosing between fame and friendship, treading the line between being a celebrity and being true to yourself.  These issues are very sensitively handled, the writing jumps off the page, the dialogue is sharp and witty. Payton and Kendall, the protagonists, are very likeable and very real-I think we all can identify with them at some level and that is another of the strengths of this wonderful novel. Compelling. Highly recommended. A great read.
081297381X|5.0|A very thoughtful out look on life events and how we as a people think we know a lot. I was surprised to realize how many things I don't know and the different way of looking at events that shape our lives and the world in general
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Anyone who can say something negative about the collaborative works of Preston and Child would have to have their head examined.  Each book with main character, Pendergast is a home run and certainly enthralling stories.  What is impressive is that the authors put a lot of effort into each plot and construct the novel well and not just cranking out books.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Awesome product, super easy to use.  Really cool addition to the living room.  Also gave out as client gifts and they were super well-received.
B000FC11A6|3.0|It may be that this book is too far above my intellectual capacity, but there was so much jumping around in time, characters, etc. that it was easy to get lost.  Also, the book is written very technically, that often missed the point.  Bottom line for me is that this was too deep and had to trudge to finish.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This was an easy-to-read page turner.  Marcus Luttrell's accounts of Navy Seal training were eye-openers.  I especially agree with his assessment of how the media misconstrues the issues and wreaks havoc on the very people trying to keep our country safe from its enemies.  I would reccommend this book to anyone interested in understanding the grit and determinatiion of our fighting elite.
B00DNDR29I|5.0|This is the greatest piece of original music I've heard in a very long time.  Great dance music, magnificent collaborations!<br />Love it from start to finish
B00F4PM6WG|5.0|I was never so pleased with a free product like this!  Lots to do and my grandchildren all love it.  wish I could find more Lego games like this.
B001NVIZ3E|5.0|A classic that has the tongue in cheek adventurer at his best. The costumes alone are well worth the watching.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|Like so many matching games, this one is quick and seriously addictive. But not just because you match icons on a screen. These icons equal stuff that helps your character level up, power up, attack or defend himself. After each level you keep your experience (which is what is going towards that 1 million title) and you use your gold, wood, stone to level up your HP, attack, defend, magic, armor, weapons. Geniusly additctive!<br /><br />If you love match games and you love RPG games you will love this game. Get it.
B002KJX4IE|5.0|Always fun to watch this...never gets old.  If you like the odd and funny this movie is a classic ~
0345803485|1.0|This book is so poorly written and the characters are so poorly developed I found myself saying, &#34;there is no way these two would end up in this situation barely knowing each other.&#34; Had there been more of a connection between the too and some more trust laid out in the begining the scenario would have seemed plausible. The writing is also extremely juvenile.
B0035QUXWQ|5.0|Who doesn't love this movie.  It makes you laugh, cry, and feel like a story can move you.  Not to mention the soundtrack is amazing.  It is worth your time if you haven't seen it and it is worth your time to watch it again....
B004V9MU86|5.0|Such a fabulous book, such a different perspective for the narration. Heartfelt and a book that stays in your head & heart
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Great show glad its on prime so I can watch it all over again for free. Not in widescreen though.
B00FN811SY|5.0|This app is an awesome tool for anyone who wants to learn what the Bible really teaches us about life and the reason we are here, and our wonderful creator. The tools it includes are easy to manage and navigate.
B000FA57N0|5.0|I'm a big fan of this movie, and of the Fox series as well.  A fun sci-fi flick with a great ensemble cast.
B000069I1H|5.0|a great movie about a actor and a cop working together. they are the strangest team out there but they still work together.
0060254920|5.0|A classic and best selling children's book.  Recommend to all!  If you don't choose to buy it, check it out from your local library.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Almost through the entire series and wonder if more will be written.  A real winner with Jack Reacher and can just visualize him in my mind.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I'm a newcomer to these puzzles, and with moderate difficulty made it through without help. Really enjoyed it; am looking forward to additional levels!
B00FPH6AXE|3.0|Will and Jaden were good, but there could have been more depth to the story.  I also enjoyed the graphics.
B00EBJ624O|5.0|This spectacular pianist possesses a virtuosity so amazing, a palette of pianistic colors so vibrant, and a depth of emotional communication so powerful, one simply cannot put into mere words the genius of this young musician
B0034G4P4O|4.0|My 7 yr old son watched this movie in a summer camp he was enrolled in. He kept asking me over and over again to please help him find this movie but he had no idea the title. We put some details of the movie in the search bar of Amazon and within ten minuets we found the movie he was interested in. I think the movie is a little long and somewhat boring, but I'm an adult, what do I know? My son watches it over and over again. The movie was shipped in pristine condition.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|Finally a Fire Maple game. It was one that again you put on your thinking cap. Worth the money for sure. You will love the game.
0786838655|5.0|I thought I wouldn't like the books too much because I am twenty-years-old, but I figured because I love Harry Potter, who was a year younger than Percy, why wouldn't I like the books? I decided to read it, and I ended up loving it.<br /><br />Percy, Annabeth, and Grover are amazing characters, and I love each of their personalities. Percy and Annabeth bicker like kids would, which actually never annoyed me, but were always there for each other in the end. Grover is shy and scared, but he does save them a couple of times, even if its clumsily done. I love the friendship between the three of them.<br /><br />It was interesting to see what gods he ran into on his way to find the master bolt. I actually DID learn things in this book about the gods. Hades wasn't a bad guy, just cranky with good reason, which I liked.<br /><br />I'm excited to see where Percy goes next.
B00BSBR9N6|4.0|I thought this book was fun, and a bit of a glimpse into the puzzling problems of Aspergers. You learned a lot while enjoying a good story.
B00E0G5U4G|3.0|Ho hum, yet another technical death album. I mean, they do it well, but that's why it's called technical. Clearly a matter of taste, but when it comes to modern death I need something... meatier. Grand Supreme Blood Court makes me feel like breaking something, whereas this just leaves me feeling restless.
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|I play a lot of games on my Kindle Fire but I play this one the most.  I love playing pool and I get to play against real people. I enjoy the challenge and its a lot of fun. I like that it gives you a opportunity to earn coins with the slot machine and scratch off. I am not a gambler which is a good thing because I have banked out several times. I like that the game gives you chances to earn these coins without having to purchase with real money.  This game relaxes me after a hard day and I totally recommend it. It is very habit forming so be sure to give yourself plenty of time to play and then get off in time to do your reality things..
B000ID37RM|5.0|You has to have a open mind to see what this movie is saying about us as people back in 1930's and how many ways we have not change, and what it take to change. love it love it
B001NLL93W|5.0|Flying through these books can't seem to put them down. A little predictable at time, but all the same very entertaining .
B00F880BWG|4.0|Great season opener, but there was still something that fell a little short with the episode.  Maybe I had too high of expectations, but I was expecting more 'unexpected'.  I could successfully predict just about every good/bad thing that happened.  I'm so used to The Walking Dead keeping me on my toes-- never knowing what to expect next, who's going to die, adrenaline pumping. But this was just kind of... plain.  Not boring, but not what I expected coming off of last season. I thought I'd be way more anxious during the episode.
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|I love this app!!  I order frequently and this makes it so easy to order anywhere!  It's fast and super easy to use!
B005BGBPBG|5.0|I read the book and then watched the movie. Both were great. The movie made me laugh really hard at a few places. Mainly Krasinki's character. He and Claire were definitely the comic relief the movie needed. I read the book and although a few things have changed and a few characters have changed it was still very good. I rented it shortly after completing the book and I can't wait to begin with Something Blue...which by the way the very end after the credits...hilarious!!
B006KX3GXO|5.0|OMG  this apps drives me crazy. I'm 100% love this apps because i found everything i want my pictures to look perfect, decorate  what i want and design in different colors. Really amazing. Keep up the good work guy and God bless
B009PMEEY2|5.0|I found this game to be about as addictive as they come.  Mildly challenging speed game.  When you start playing this game, you have time to use strategy, but as the game progresses, you need to stop trying to think and merely play by instinct in order to move forward.  I have had more than a few groggy days recently because I stayed up late playing.  I finally managed to overcome my addiction to this game by completing all the challenges only to discover there's a Azkend 2 available... and managed to get the sequel as a Daily Download here at Amazon.  I guess it'll be another few nights without sleep.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|This game is a really fun and challenging card game, the fact that i am even writing a review shows how good it is. It is sort of like magic and the best part is that its challenging because games just keep getting more easy as time goes on.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Forget the image it is *supposed* to look like, just play the puzzle as a set of random pixels and you gotta select which ones are which.  This is a great logic game and quite user friendly.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|... The fresh Soundtrack and fresh Graphics were really cool... but the Game Play was still Classic &#34;Angry Birds.&#34;... so I could come out shootin', right out of the Box.  :-)<br /><br />Rich
B008EL25LE|5.0|I only just conquered my addiction to Azkend two nights ago (OK, truth be known, I just finished the different challenges...) and now I've got a new fix.  I enjoy this game a great deal and find it a bit more challenging than the match three games (jewels type) and enjoy this type far more.  I haven't completed the game and according to a few other reviews, I may do so in short order... but I'm sure I'm going to have fun doing it.  (And unlike those who grumbled about price, I was lucky enough to get this one on the Free Daily Download from Amazon.)
B004J4WLB4|3.0|Fairly good story<br /><br />.the ending was very predictable. I doubt I will read another by this author  it took a while to get into the story.
B00EEDJM2Q|4.0|Don't let the childish image fool you.  This game takes a bit of strategy. I'd give the game a five star rating except that I think the sensors are a bit too picky.  If I swipe my finger beyond the last button on a row, it should recognize that I made my decision,  but no... I must stop over the button.  I find that annoying as it slows me down.
B00ECLTYOG|3.0|The first two movies were almost non-stop humor and was looking forward to seeing the third however I was disappointed.  Hangover III was much darker and the humor didn't flow.  I was not impressed with Hangover III.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I have not quite finished this book however it is very interesting and has many twists and turns in the story.  Fast read and can't wait to discover the ending to the story!
B005CRQ3NY|4.0|I loved the book it was so funny I liked the picture s it was a great book about Greg's summer vacation :{
B006BAEQB2|4.0|I enjoyed this book as the next installment of the Cousin's War series.  I have read them from the beginning and it is an interesting concept to tell the same story within a timeframe from all the different perspectives.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|I want to thank Dave Grohl for bringing us the story behind the sound track to my life.  So many great artists and legendary albums were produced at Sound City.  That place touched the lives of millions of people.  It was great seeing so many legendary artists performing in the latter half of the film.  Rock on, Dave.  Rock on.<br /><br />P.S. Turn it up... way up.
B00A285OOW|4.0|I have reread all of this series in anticipation on this book and it went along with the other stories and was interesting and the storyline kept my interest.  My only complaint about this or any of the other books in this series is that they just end with the story still to be told.  Also this book in particular ended at 85% on my Kindle and the excerpt that took up most of the balance of the download was of the first book in the series.  That was a waste for me since I read that before.  It is really irritating to pay for a book and it end at less than 100%.
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|its so funny i laugh every second i play it! its so fun  i let my little brother play it ,i think he likes it I cant tell (hes 2)
0553381695|5.0|it is better than the show! Please start here and work your way to the shows. This explains a lot more that is going on and sets out plot lines.
B0015DWJ8W|5.0|I gave this book 5 stars because it was interesting and well written. This would be a great book to re-read every now and then. I really didn't dislike anything. I liked how naturally everything flowed together and I got to enter the mind and get to know the author. I would recommend this book for fans of Murakami and fans of memoirs in general.
B0002HYHSW|5.0|Love this game. We have it opinion our collection, and have also gifted it many times. Simple easy gameplay for three year olds, enough complexity with different color and shape sticks to add math later on for olds kids
B004I744AS|2.0|I am not very pleased with this. I get better help spelling something from my Kindle. As I type a word on there if I am not sure of the spelling it gives me words that fit. This dictionary does not find words for you, if you misspell something it just says not found. If I knew how to spell it in the first place I wouldn't need the dictionary.

B000LXQVA4|5.0|We bought Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo for our main residence. Our baby girl just loved it from the start! She began using it when she was just 3,5 month old and couldn't even sit up on her own yet, so we put a little blanket behind her back so she could feet snug). As her feet couldn't reach the floor yet we put a few big books on the floor underneath. All this worked out just great!! Now that she is 6 month old she doesn't need blanket or books any more. She really loves her jumper and is fascinated by it's vibrant and cheery colors and toys!<br /><br />For our second home we purchased Baby Einstein Musical Motion Activity Jumper (just wanted to try another jumper for a change). It was a little disappointing to us. Our girl still can not sit in it comfortably even at 6 months. The seat is very wide and shallow and there is nothing I can do to make my baby comfortable. Also the holes for legs are positioned very weird - they are located more toward the front of the seat rather than the middle and it makes my baby tilt forward way too much. She loves the toys on this jumper, but I can tell that she can't reach them very well because of the seat position. She can stay in the jumper for a maximum of 5 minutes and then wants to get out.<br /><br />She can stay in the Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo for at least 20 min and always has a blast! It's a joy to watch her jump in it! I would definitely recommend this one for your baby! you will not regret:)
B000000WF0|5.0|Every once on a while I listen to this and reminisce about the way it was and that God that it is getting better, and I see that my life is getting better, I have come a long way in good directions and I see a much brighter future just ahead,  I only struggle now to control my impatience in getting there as every day is linked to the slow world of governmental bureaucratic system which is slowing assisting me as well as everyone I know in creating better lives for themselves while most of them unwittingly and sometimes selfishly grind about the world around them I say unwittingly and sometimes selfishly because the government in the United States of America is literately made up of the decisions of the real live people that live here everyday. So frankly man they are bitch-en in my face an telling me that I am not making their world everything that they want it to be, but I don't see them reaching out to do it for them selves and they sure ass hell aren't reachen out to help me are they, well some did, thanks for voting.
B0035QUXWQ|5.0|It's a great movie, and it looked good on my tv, I'm glad I could order it instantly and watch it.
B00BCZU8WM|3.0|OK CD, was expecting better form JT. Bought several CDS at the same time, this is my least favorite of the group
B00280LYHS|5.0|I loved this whole series! The story is captivating and you fall in love with the characters right a way.
0440242401|4.0|Overall I really enjoyed the book.  Kinsella is a master of escapism and humour.  It is a bit of an extreme concept but allows for an entertaining story.<br /><br />This book had more heavy themes and messages than many of her other books.  There were a lot of extreme characters which led to a bit of an emotional roller coaster ride. Lexi goes through a lot of highs and lows. The \\"American Dream\\" of being rich and good looking gets thoroughly deflated as a shallow, limited, materialistic and stressful existance.  The idea of sacrificing your authentic self to get ahead in your career is strongly criticized.  There is a message to stick with family and friends no matter what.<br /><br />I would have liked Eric to have more dimensions to leave Lexi more ambivalent and to add some suspense about the outcome.  Kinsella gave him a sterotyped rich and controlling persona and he was very unlikeable.<br /><br />More thought provoking than her other books but still as entertaining and creative as always!
B001AQQR2S|4.0|It's a good movie and Danny DeVito is the greatest but the book is better. The movie has many rather disgusting moments as does the book really but it always looks worse on screen somehow.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Love playing this game, although sometimes it freezes after you've chosen how many cards you wanna play n you lose your coins, however have had coins returned a couple times as well, would definitely recommend this game to friends very addictive
0385523394|5.0|Do I agree with everything the author states?  No.  Did I find this to be a fascinating viewpoint on her year in prison and an amazing read?  Yes!  I am an extremely different person then this author; my boyfriend works in law enforcement so I always think everyone is guilty before they even go to court.  Sorry but it's my truth and I see how much he has to go through just to get someone to court, and this is why I will never ever be in a jury of my peers.  I am open-minded enough however to see what her side of the world looks like and everything she had to endure.  I have never been in a prison so this all blew my mind.  Piper really tries to get you to side with her on inmates rights and how much time so-and-so should do vs someone else, which was kind of annoying but other then that I loved reading about her experience and learning about what prison is like and reading about all the different characters and discovering how the book is different then the Netflix series.  I respect Piper for having done her time and trying to make the world a better place through her book.  I don't agree with all the \\"improvements\\" she seems to be striving for but some of them I can understand.  I really enjoyed reading this book so if you are over there waffling with whether or not to buy it...do it!
B00785P2QC|4.0|I'm still getting the hang of things ; now that I have a little time off. Glad to have had gotten as far as I have. The game is starting to get interesting now .
B00CS74W0C|5.0|Couldn't put the book down. The book is very suspenseful, dirty and romantic. Can't wait for the forth book to come out
B007FEZQF8|5.0|It is a great book I have only seen the tv show until now and there are a few minor differences but there is a couple big differences but overall great book
B005MMY9A8|5.0|Great story, good acting, incredible visuals. I've seen this movie a bunch of times and I still love it.  Great movie.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I definitely give this game 5 stars because it's just not your typical card game, it's so much more than that! Definitely more exciting and fun! Great job guys, keep up the good work!
6305428042|5.0|A must for BETTE MIDLER fans she's got to be at her best to keep people watching this Halloween classic!!
B007BFSYMS|4.0|I love listening to the campfire sound while reading in bed. The realistic rain effect soothes me to all Leo almost every night. Unique non-repetitive sounds effects that are perfect for relaxing.
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|A great dose of wit and sarcasm to mask the dark events in this book. Great read. I have definitely recomended to others.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|I loved this app and for a long time it was my app of choice reading the Bible on my Kindle. The latest version of this app does not work, so I am forced to use a different app, losing all my notes and highlights.  The drop-down to change the book does not work, so you cannot easily navigate through the Bible.  Please fix this!
B00AHTYGRW|4.0|Unfortunately, this was not the version I was looking for. This is copy was the theatrical version and did not contain the deleted scenes that were available in the extended version available in the UK and Europe thru Amazon UK. Ended up buying the UK version and was much happier with that copy as it contained all the Taylor Schilling deleted scenes.
B0058UXHHK|4.0|the bucket list of a 24 year old life deprived woman is simple yet so interesting. it was even more interesting when you add in an abusive mother, an over protective sister, lazy police and a sexy man next door. i want a joe next door too!
B00866JLEG|4.0|I actually only purchased this movie because Taylor Schilling is one of the stars. I If it wasn't for Taylor, I would have passed on this type of movie. Taylor is such a wonder actor I am beginning collection of her filmography because she probably one of the finest actors I have seen is quite a while.<br />What can I say about this movie. If you have seen one of Nick Sparks movies you have seen them all.
B007SVPZMW|2.0|Not bad, but certainly not enough to keep an adult entertained.  The hardest setting wasn't very hard.  I expected to end in a tie more often than not, but I found that I won more than I tied.<br /><br />My daughter loves tic tac toe, but even on medium, this was a bit simple for her and she's only 9.  As a freebie, it might be ok, but I wouldn't pay for it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am new to Pinterest and I just love!  It has a lot of good interests you can follow.<br />I like the arts & crafts and photos.
B008469DGY|4.0|Flick Golf, like many of the &#34;Flick&#34; games (flick soccer, flick football, flick rugby, etc...) is fun for a while, but after you get the mechanics down, it is almost too easy.  I think I had the hang of it in 15 or 20 minutes, and rarely touched it after that.  It just seemed too easy after playing with it for a bit.
0345501292|5.0|This book has everything there is to know about the Indiana Jones franchise. Insane amounts of details on all four movies with tons of background information and behind the scenes photos. I'm glad that I finally broke down and bought this. I don't regret it! A must have for the true Indy fan!
B00BMNM4H6|3.0|Sugar, sugar was fun for a while.  After a few levels, I just got bored with it.  My daughter had the same experience.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Would recommend to anyone who likes a good read. It took awhile to finish all, but I can't wait to read the last one.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|ITEM RECEIVED. Glad to hear this DVD show of Australia. Outstanding is the word. You will dance all nightand day
B0098460O4|5.0|I love this CD. Jonathan and Charlotte are such a talented an amazing duo. With their music careers beginning at such a young age, I cannot wait to see what great things are ahead for these two artists! I will enjoy this CD for years to come as it is a classic.
B0007P0LO8|3.0|I was a bit disappointed in this production. I have seen better versions. The music and vocals of course were wonderful as always. Maybe I'd have enjoyed it more had it not been a film.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Fantastic story,  I didn't want to put the book down. Couldn't read it fast enough. Would highly recommend this to everyone.
B000YCLRBA|5.0|This is wonderful! Both main singers, especially Renne Fleming are superb! I had seen it before, now so glad to have my own copy and can watch it over and over!
B0012QRPU4|5.0|Geez what a Freakin TV Show and Actors!!  Awesome.<br /><br />We had to watch the rest of TV seasons after this!!
B000PKG7I4|5.0|Excellent disc.  This was purchased as a gift for a music lover and it was very much apprciated.  I would recommend this disc.
B003Z0BWRM|5.0|I know this is a young adult book but I love it.  Maybe its just the genre I am drawn to as I also really enjoyed Twilight.<br />I purchased this book after seeing the movie and I must admit it hooked me immediately. I could not put the book down.  I so love Jace - his humour keeps it entertaining, and of course the chemistry between him and Clary.<br />I have already purchased book 2 and cannot wait to devour it as well as the rest of the series.
B000001FTJ|5.0|Excellent excellent disc, would highly recommend this to any music lover who appreciates something a little different...TURN off commercial radio and listen to some REAL music.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Kept me interested and wanting to read more. plot was odd but believable. look forward to reading more from this author
B000000OF6|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE Queen!  This is a great compilaton of my favorites songs along with some I have never heard before but are quickly becoming new fav's!
039916409X|5.0|I work in sales and always have goals that I must meet.  Don't know how I stumbled onto Margaret Lynch's site but it has been life altering for the good.  I do her tapping routine most every might and have never been behind my pacing goal or my annual goals for any of my events.  Don't know what I would do if I did not do these every night.  Her book allows me to highlight areas and come back to them.  It's organized and well thought out!  Love it and can't say enough about it.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|My nephew loves this game. I find it funny when out of the blue he will tell me what he is cooking. It does take a lot of time to &#34;cook&#34; things but it is a lot like the games on Facebook.
B00C90T4QK|5.0|Absolutely LOVE a Buble CD! The songs are just so fun and touch my heart. I love listening to it everyday.
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|I love this game because it keeps my nephew busy for hours. He will grab my Kindle or phone and go right for this game and he will sit and play it for hours. The only bad thing is before I know it he had my batteries eaten all up.
B006LSZECO|2.0|The first half was boring and I almost didn't continue. But, I usually try to finish a book, hoping it will get better. The twists and turns in the drama began in the second half. However, the people are unbelievable characters (rather caricatures) and the story just jumped around with lots of repeated information.  I really wish I hadn't wasted my time and money on the book.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|This is another one of those time consuming games. i keep getting messages to feed the fish and I have no idea what they mean because it is my nephew's game so i am probably killing all of his fish.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Very stimulating and can be quite frustrating at times but certainly keeps your mind agile. This is the third cut the rope I have encountered and they're all equally really good.
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|What can I say it is an Angry Birds game and I personally don't play it but my nephew loves it. I asked him what he thought of it and he said it is not the best one but it is pretty good. The words of a seven-year-old.
B00E3UN44W|1.0|Considering that as of this date 10/17/2013, Sherlock: Season Three hasn't even been produced yet what are these people commenting on. Amazon, why are you offering a product that may not be available for at least a year as a preorder.
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|This was a nice addition the the Angry Birds Family. My nephew was excited when he saw I added it to my Kindle and and phone for him. I personally don't see the hype about Angry Birds but my nephew gives it two thumbs up so I will take his word for it.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Bubble witch is so addicting and hard to stop playing.  Sometimes I get bored with it because I can't beat a level and I refuse to pay for extra bubbles.  Overall it is a great game and I play it every day.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|This is another one of those games that takes up lots of game room on your Kindle so it is not a game that the kids love it may not be a keeper.
B008N9AASC|5.0|Have already seen this movie at the theatre , but my husband and I decided it so beautiful that we would purchase it for<br />home. Tried it yesterday and it is so clear will enjoy watching it over and over.
B007FJFDXS|4.0|I have found this game is fun for all ages. I like it at my age (not going to share) and my seven-year-old nephew even enjoys this game so it can amuse us all.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|This oral history by the people being affected is so believable that makes the reader not put the book down.
B0071AKB38|2.0|Not loud enough at all. Looked nice and compact, but the sound quality was no where near what I thought It would be getting. Probably my own fault for expecting more.  Cute looking though!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I absolutely love this game, why better than subway surfers. Plus it pass time and its very challenging. Now trying to find a way to use up my remaining letters.
B0089LOG02|5.0|A compelling read with a history lesson included.  I was aware of the Orphan Trains, but many of my friends who I mentioned the book to had never heard of it.  I enjoyed the book very much.
1934030198|5.0|The ulitmate book for the traning nerd. Many relevant training tips for the enthusiastic triathlete. I would also recommend<br />Friel`s Going Long.
B00DHHWYAW|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie. My wife had been wanting it so I bought it. The 3D really makes for an exceptional experience of Gatsby and Daisy's love journey! Awesome take on a classic book. A MUST BUY!
B005HI4LMS|5.0|The Actors were a perfect fit. Everything works in the movie. You have to read the box cover to know were the movie starts. The first time I watched it, I didn't get that everybody in the movie is a &#34;Good Guy&#34;.  Great...
1594204217|1.0|After really loving the omnivore's dilemma, my feeling as I finished this book was I can't believe I just spent $20 on this. What a waste.<br /><br />His recipe for the mysterious 'sugo', (which turns out to be simple bolognese or meat sauce)  typifies the whole book:<br />it requires 3 HOURS of active preparation time! Who can, or wants, to spend that on a weekday meal? And the recipe has an unbelievable amount of fat, including whole milk and a sofritto fried in a 'scary' amount of oil (his term). he seems oblivious to the fact that most of the population these days is looking to go easy on the calories and eat lighter,  It's just not helpful and not relevant to our lives today. You can make a great bolognese with much less fat, begun with 2 tbsp n of olive oil, simmered for half an hour. Here you would be getting great tasting, homemade, unprocessed food with much less calorie and time cost. There is no skill to great food that takes all day to make, anyone can do that, it is so unrealistic and indulgent! We need help getting nutritious whole food on the table in a way that is realistic and everyone says- yes I can fit that in my life.<br /><br />However he obviously thinks he is doing well in the cooking department, choosing a quote for the back of the book that describes him as a hell of  a cook. That just floored me!! He had a year of private cooking classes with an amazing chef and at the end he can cook a stew, if he has a whole afternoon to spare! As a busy mom I get a healthy supper on the table, cooked from scratch, every night, in an hour tops.<br /><br />As for the rest of the book, the information on the four types of cooking is nothing deeper than you could get from a google search.  The philosophical rambling on meat began well but led nowhere, and he wasn't really saying anything, just quoting a whole lot of sources. The book in general feels journalistic, like a dry accumulation of quotes and facts, mixed in with pollans amateur cooking attempts.<br /><br />We all know by now pollan is no vegetarian, but he writes as if the only thing called food is meat, with fully half the book, and the entire section on home cooking, discussing cooking meat. Seems he has forgotten his own rule of 'eat mostly plants'. He has also forgotten his own earlier denunciation of factory farming, and this book describes him eating factory farmed hogs. Although I remember him saying in a ny times article that the two things he would never eat were tomatoes that had been in the fridge (he is, after all, a connoisseur) and feed lot meat. So he is bending his ethics, doesn't sit well with me.<br /><br />He wrote this book to milk a little more out of his popularity but I don't think he has had anything book worthy to say since the omnivores dilemma and he should stick to articles.<br /><br />There are many other writers on nutrition (marion nestle) food and whole foods cooking (levana kirschenbaum) with far more helpful things to say.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|i think that this a nice fun game but the only thing i dont like is that i think all theese games are just copies of temple run
B007SGM084|5.0|I thought that fifty shades darker had alot of spine tingling excitment holding me at the edge of my seat.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|Really people. 1 star. you have got to be kidding me. The app is fun and that is it. no more than that
B005KIQDYE|4.0|My girls are really into their Lego &#34;Friends&#34;.  They play for hours and when their friends are over, these are the toys that are played with the most.  My daughters love to pretend their Lego characters are going out to eat.  There is one indoor table that can seat 4 figures  and the outdoor table has 2 chairs, but the figures have a hard time staying on since it's on the slippery side.  There are 2 figures included in the set,  one is Marie the waitress, and the other is Andrea.  The little gumball machine is just too cute.  So glad Lego has these &#34;Friends&#34; sets for  Girls and celebrate their differences.  Highly recommend this product.
B008B92U32|4.0|Face Swap brought lots of laughs to a family vacation that had taken a few wrong turns.  It's very fun to play with and see how awkward you can make yourself and others look.  It's important to note that this works best when the subjects in the picture are looking at the camera straight on.  It is difficult to make your finished picture look good when one or more faces in the picture are rotated one way or the other.  The only issue that I had with it was that when you tap on a face to edit the selected area, the app zooms in, but doesn't put the face in the middle of the screen.  After which, if you try to move the zoomed in picture to see the face better, it just zooms out.  A relatively small gripe, and certainly not a deal breaker, but if this were to be fixed, it would be 5 stars from me.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|if u have a budget for your frens, what better way than to give them this! worth the money and useful for presentation.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|As a fan from day 1, I have kept the shows (good and not so good) because I missed keeping a series years ago that is not available. If you like a series own it!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I've watched it several times. Star Trek is my favorite. Hate the word minimum. One two three four five six.
0061367036|5.0|This book is a good companion to the series, lists the monsters and demons along with more information about them.
B0023SDQB2|4.0|In a British mental hospital, solders who have had mental relapses in the slaughter during World War I are treated by psychiatrists, who must try to heal them so that they can return to the&#34; stalemate war&#34; that continues for those who profit from it.<br />  It is a powerful book showing how the psychiatrists have to decide every month on which men are &#34;cured&#34; and ready for battle.<br />  My only criticism is that it is difficult to keep track of the different cases as their stories unfold.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|A great game to have. Seems like a real horse! Awesome game for the one's who dream of having a horse but isn't able to have one.
B00BE909NO|4.0|Very good. Quite violent but true to the way these people behaved. Good idea to have read Great Expectations if you are reading this book or seeing the film.
B0001ARCFA|2.0|I really wish I could give these headphones a good review, honestly I do, but the build quality is so poor that I cannot give them more than 2 stars. As far as sound goes they're fantastic, especially for their price. They have a very honest and well balanced sound, with accurate reproduction of both bass and higher frequencies alike. However, none of that matters when they're broken, and they break VERY easily, and this is coming from someone who treats their hardware with extreme care! One of the features that is listed for these headphones is that you can listen with one ear by twisting one can off to the side of your head. I did this frequently during use, and after a couple of months it caused the right can to just BREAK OFF. Upset, but determined to continue using them because of their exceptional sound, I soldered the wires back in place and superglued the can back on and continued using them. This happened twice. Now it has become obvious that the right can has developed a bad connection, and now I've finally given up on them. If they still worked, I might actually give these a 5 star review because they sound so fantastic, but that means nothing when they're broken. My frustration is accentuated by the fact that I've gotten so used to these I can no longer stand to listen to consumer level headphones but I'm forced to for the time being.<br /><br />In summary:<br /><br />They sound fantastic, but the cheap flimsy plastic they're made of breaks very easily, and all the sound quality in the world doesn't matter when they're broken. You're better off finding a pair of cans at a similar price point that aren't entirely made of plastic.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A great story of young love by two mature, likeable kids that you root for the entire time and cry at heir heartache!
B00DAPOHU6|4.0|This is Big Jack's best album since his best album of all-time, Sleep Through the Static.<br /><br />Three classics: Ones and Zeros, Washing Dishes, and Home; two very good songs: Change and As I Was Saying; and the rest vary in quality, without one clunker.<br /><br />Ones and Zeros, in my mind, is his best song since Go On, off of Sleep Through the Static. (Go On remains, to this day, his one song where he stepped outside himself.)
0385040253|5.0|Great book use it in my job I recommend it to all walks of life and just all round good knowledge to have in someone's basic tool kit
B004742Y68|4.0|It is the scariest pg movie ever made.  It is the reason I don't like clowns.  Great to watch with the kids.
B0029EDMEG|5.0|I just love these movies. I have to figure out which order to watch them, however. I've watched a few, randomly out of order. I will look it up before I watch the next one. ;)
B009XIXVU6|5.0|From the beginning to the end this book kept me spellbound. The charaters were describe so I could visualize them and the story was heartwarming with historical interest. The author brought together the families in a historic loop. I highly reccomend this book.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|I loved the story in this book. I read it all in one sitting. However, there were so many metaphors for what the basic story was about that I found myself pretty lost by the end. I hate to admit it but I never did figure it all out. I'm not sure by the way it was written that we are supposed to fully. It got kind of wild toward the end. I'd like to know what others ideas are about it.
B000069CWE|5.0|its creative.its got songs from this band originally.i love it.i wanna learn it all over again.you should try it if you  love this band.

B00DYFCZ2Y|5.0|Just a great album. Keeps some of the charm of &#34;Get Lifted&#34; while dipping its toe in the modern waters of &#34;Evolver.&#34;
B0012GMYRS|5.0|This is my third copy.  I keep loaning it out and not getting it back.  I don't really go for Dion but this is the S***.

B006FO3ERQ|1.0|Soooo slooooowww The minutiae just killed me.  It started off interesting, and the plot is interesting.  But then nothing happens.  At all.
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|What can I say about this? It's Neon Genesis in HD! This is the first in the &#34;Rebuild of Evangelion&#34; series, and is a great start to newcomers and fans of the original T.V show. Now, the only thing about this film is that it sticks very close to the show and at times, I felt like they just reused shots, but other than that, it's a fantastic film on its own.
B003G4W49C|5.0|great story written well lots of insight into human physics and behavior.  loved the thought of children genius.<br /><br />looking forward to reading the rest of the series.
B004EC5IUW|5.0|As much as I loved the first Evangelion movie, &#34;You Are (Not) Alone&#34;, I felt that it sticked too close to the original show. This one makes up big time with some major changes. I love all the changes made to the plot, but the best part had to have been the ending. While not quite as amazing as &#34;End of Evangelion's&#34; ending, it's pretty out there, and is great! Personally, I'm beyond excited for 3.33 to get here to the states. I really hope that will be even better!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Best show on television.  Can't wait for season four to begin. Just so sad that two of my favorite characters will no longer be in the series.
B00B8R1NP0|4.0|Wow Time Killer is an excellent story<br />I couldn't put it down down until I finished<br />Fast paced well woven psychological thriller
B003Z0BWR2|5.0|Very well written.  Even for an almost 40 year old it kept my interest and i couldn't put it down
B001IYCMNA|5.0|I've had this unit for a couple of years and it's been absolutely rock solid. I have had laptop computers connected to it literally non-stop for weeks. Speed is fine. No dropouts that I know of. I can take a laptop a block away and still get connectivity. Perhaps it's karma for all the trouble I've had with other computer & network devices!
B003Z0BWT0|5.0|Again a very well written book full of intrigue- again I couldn't put it down.  Off to read the next one.
B006M4F67A|5.0|This is an awesome game. There are so many different boards and levels to concur and play. I love the challenge of beating my own time.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Ok bought the DVD and it will not work in my xbox?!? Someone please help!!! When I put the DVD in its just a blank screen
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This novel was gifted to me by a friend who knew once I read it, I'd be hooked.  I am.  Having never read a Liane Moriaty novel, I became an instant fan and her novels fill my wish list.  I plan to read them all before the end of 2014 (yes, 2014 - my TBR list is long). The Husband's Secret is a sobering story about \\"secrets\\" and a novel that makes for a rather difficult review.  I don't want to insert spoilers, so let me just say Ms. Moriarty is an exceptional writer who develops characters that somehow touch a sense of knowing in all readers. That is true talent you see almost immediately in this spellbinding, thought provoking novel, fueled by an article about real life deathbed confessions and the consequences that follow. This skillfully told tale is an assessment of principles, betrayal, love, and absolution that captivates readers and fills us with our own questions of what we might do in the same situation. How many people would have stuck around, much less married their beloved if they'd known such dark secrets? Even after learning the husband's secret, readers follow remarkably portrayed characters whose lives keep you turning pages like a maniac. In this complex yet plausible plot, readers can't wait to unweave the details and learn what, if any, consequences follow the deception of one man. I highly recommend it!!
B004J1DBJI|4.0|I was about to give this a poor rating and delete it when I discovered and watched the introductory video. Now I get it, I understand and know the basics and I'm hooked.<br /><br />One star off for no gesture zoom.
B007SGM084|5.0|I highly suggest reading these books if you want to fire up your love life!  Best books I ever read!
B00EUS9JF0|4.0|as with quite a few mccartney albums....you have to give it 2 or 3 listens before it really hits you. the first time through the cd...i thought it was just okay compared to many other of his cd's. but damn....by the third listen w/ the cd cranked up...i was hooked. each tune has such a personality. beatles feel, wings feel, mccartney feel. this cd has something for everything. i'm especially hooked on \\"appreciate, new and on my way to work\\".<br /><br />but for all the haters on the reviews....give it a listen or two or three before giving your final verdict. would have given it one more star if sir paul would have put his collaboration w/ the foo fighters on this cd. adding that balls to the wall rocker on this cd would have been the icing on the cake. rock on sir paul!
B006LSZECO|2.0|I WAS VERY DISSAPOINTED WITH THIS BOOK.  I don't know what all the hype was about.  Don't waste your time.
B009LDD54K|5.0|I ordered this right after the season came out and I couldn't wait to watch it. I love this show and the 3rd season didn't dissapoint at all.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I COULD NOT LOG ON AND NOW IT IS CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE! :( NEED TO FIX IT SOON. PLEASE! THANK YOU VERY MICH!!
B003BV8I3Q|5.0|Excellent masterpiece of acting!<br />My family and I watched it twice in one day! An expensive jewel for the price.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|Seriously! I can't get enough of Supernatural. Love the show, love the storylines, love the characters. We watch the entire series about twice a year.
B00FJTYDKK|4.0|This movie was defiantly hilarious! I would recommend it to my friends, it's a family friendly movie, as well. I look forward to more movies like this.
B00F91RYL8|1.0|Can't believe Pitt was a party to this.  Curiosity got the best of my husband.  Well, he's paying for it.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I love how you can layer the different sounds. I see other reviews talking about timers ....I don't see how to set a timer and as far as I know it played all night because my battery was drained. is the timer an option on the free version?
B008LXZFH6|1.0|We thought we were in for a family comedy and then it shows Will Ferrell with a boner.  We couldn't shut it off fast enough.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Totally worth it. Martin Freeman and Benedict Cumberbatch make quite a team. Can't wait to see them in another season.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a fun, and engaging game. I enjoy playing it to pass the time. The adds are minimal and the graphics are good. I highly recomend this game. :)
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Loved the book. It made me think that you are what people think of you.<br />I guess August IS a wonder.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|The book is EXCELLENT and the writing is lyrical and wonderful!  However, the story jumped around so much and it was difficult to keep track of all the different story lines.
B0017I1IZA|4.0|Janet Evanovich books make me laugh out loud when I am reading them.  They are simply a fun read.  It is fun to see what mischief Stephanie will get into next time. And how her car gets destroyed this time.
B005HEFB6M|5.0|Excellently written series for the Sci Fi  fan.  It was a shame that so many insiders apparently suffered from Star Trek exhaustion,  and the series lasted only 4 years.  Imaginative scripts.
B00B9B4IYI|1.0|gets disconnected every 3-5 mins so every song you hear has a momentary glitch. Not acceptable! I returned it after trying it for a week.
0446581356|5.0|I LIKE HOW CLEAR THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE AND HOW HELPFUL THE ILLUSTRATION ARE. IT'S A BOOK THAT WOMEN OF ALL AGES COULD FIND HELPFUL WHEN APPLYING MAKEUP.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Our granddaughter bought this game with her own money and loves it.<br />Wish it had a manual on how to play, like board games from the store.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Arrived quickly and we loved the movie.  We would recommend it to other Hobbit folk.  Now we can't wait for the next movie to come out.  Hooray
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|Since I love everything Paul releases, it's not surprising that I love this CD too.<br />Thanks, Paul, for &#34;NEW&#34; music to listen to.  Your Devoted Fan Since 1963 !
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I have to say that i was so exciting about a good brand streaming for 35$, but it isnt as good as i expect, first only works on youtube and netflix (this works great on ios 7.02) but a have a galaxy tab 2 updated both android and nexflix app but there isnt very estable on it, continuosly have to restart the app it stops or stuck buffering.<br /><br />no plex, none of video media player...<br />only 2 stars, i hope that more app become compatible with it or iam going to sell it and buy another apple tv.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|This game is pretty good. It does what it is suppose to do. Good story and puzzles. Filler filler filler filler
B00915G6MG|5.0|Even though I have not actually watched Season 10 yet.....I could not pass up the price... I have ALL 10 seasons.... have watched the first 9 about 4 times now...I truly think it is that good....I am half way through 9.... again.... lol
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|It's rare a sequel holds as much sway as the original. King yet again thrills and scares page after page. Best story I've read in a long time.
0307895505|5.0|Yeah, this is amazing. Definite must for anyone wanting an in-depth guide. It is particularly helpful with Hearthfire, as that DLC requires quite a lot of pre-planning and resource gathering.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|From many perspectives Gladwell challenges us to look closely at what is normally thought of as a disadvantage.  And bring light to the way some have been able to compensate and excel without the burden of common expectations a normal range of abilities or circumstances carries. I love the way he brings the reader to understand promise in what might have felt hopeless on the inside; like the kid(s) who can't read..... There's always another way.
B000ID37LS|5.0|Love this comedy/horror film. It's a classic Halloween movie to watch over and over. It's just scary enough to make you jump and funny enough to keep the mood light.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I love all of the Star Trek movies and this one fit's into my library very nicely.  These movies give me hope for the future.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Love this fan, as good as watercooling. Would highly suggest getting the second fan. Current system temp with it is 32 degrees. Awesome cooling for a lot less money.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|BEST TV SHOW EVER... IM ADDICTED TO IT... LOOKED FOR IT FOR MONTHS TILL I FINALLY FOUND IT ON AMAZON... THANKS
B002WY65W4|4.0|I liked this movie.  It was funny and quirky.  Woody Harelson was his usual excellent self, and the rest of the cast did well too!  If  you are looking for academy awards stuff, this isn't the movie for you.  If you are looking for an excellent, funny, and a bit gory movie, this is an excellent buy.
B00464CU7M|5.0|This DVD is purely great music, by a great singer in a great presentation. As a Katherine Jenkins fan, this DVD is a must to have.
B000P0J0D8|5.0|Always liked this star studded well directed flick.  Needed it for my collection.  Now I have it to enjoy whenever.
B004HXIZVC|5.0|Soundcloud always works, no mess-ups. I love using it. I use mine to listen to the hottest artists out there.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|avengers, good moive. everyone knows that. so, i dont want to to talk too much. have a nice day. XD
B00FPGSPQU|3.0|This movie was NOT as great as I thought it would be.  The best part of the previous movies is that the guys &#34;woke up&#34; and had no idea what had really happened and then the adventure began.  However, in this movie the plot was right before you and just simply was not as funny or as well written as previous Hangovers. That being said, love these men!
B003UYUP58|5.0|I read this book to try and gain some understanding and I have. It held my interest and was worded well enough to understand terminology.
B00DURHYWC|5.0|Love Pink Martini -- their songs always inspire and this new CD lives up to that same inspirational &#34;feel good&#34; expectation.
B008F9VCC8|5.0|I brought the set as a birthday gift for my step daughter. She loved it, & has been reading the books ever since they arrived. I only wish I had gotten the set in a hardcover edition, instead of the softcover ones.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Great movie. It won't blow your mind, but it is very entertaining.  And of course, anything with Morgan Freeman will be good.
1465408681|5.0|the Yoda Chronicles came real quick...was for my 18 year old grandson who loves Star Wars. I know he'll really like it. :)
B0026P3G12|5.0|I could say that my Susan Boyle is one of treasures.  The way she sings is so uplifting.  I love her!
B009MO5E10|5.0|There are times when a movie just &#34;hits&#34; me. This was that movie. It kept me on the edge of my seat, the action and the skill of these riders was amazing. My hat goes off to those bike couriers where EVER you are!!!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|IN GOOGLE'S DEFENSE I BOUGHT THIS DEVICE ASSUMING TO MUCH, I WAS HOPING FOR THE GOOGLE MARKET PLACE BUT THAT DOESN'T EXIST ON THE CHROME CAST. GET USED TO YOU TUBE AND THAT'S ABOUT IT.
1250038820|5.0|I just got the book this morning.  I was so exited that I ripped the cover before I even got the book out of the box.  The cover is taped together but the scars will be lasting.  Like humans in New York and everywhere, this book is perfect and flawed at the same time.  Thanks, Brandon, for your outstanding work.
B000CDO330|5.0|Once in a while you receive something that's not what the picture looked like but<br />the Giraffe was exactly like the picture. It also came packaged very well and the<br />delivery time was quick.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This was recommended to me by a friend. It is obvious that my friend and I have entirely different tastes for writing. Parts of this were sickening to me.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I watched the show and then read the book. Very compelling. The show follows the first book very closely, with well drawn characters, and smart plot.
B0000UJDLM|5.0|This is a wonderful movie to watch. Very entertaining and exciting in parts. Have not seen the movie in over ten years. Recently I had a stress test and heart xray. The technicians name was &#34;Stephanie&#34;. I told her she reminded me of the young lady in the Short Circuit movie. Thought about this for a week or so and decided to see if it was still available. It was. I ordered one for me and one for the xray technician. Good to nsee the story again.
B009LM4BGM|4.0|Great read...  truly enjoyed this, unbelievable how similar it is to the movie. Great descriptions of life in a boarding school and the impact a teacher can have in the lives of young people.
B000OBYLVO|5.0|I am not into romance stories but this one is absolutely great. I watch it every so often as it will make a down day for you cheer up at the end of the day. The best I have seen Cameron in any movie.
B00CATSONE|1.0|A rather disappointingly short glimpse of the life of Nikola Tesla interspersed with the author's ideas on finding your own genius or creativity.  The story reads like a self-help book combined with a Reader's Digest-like biographical highlight of Tesla's life.<br /><br />There are far better books about the quirky, brilliant genius that was Nikola Tesla.  I would suggest \\"Cities of Light\\" as a great book covering the struggle between Edison, Westinghouse and Tesla to electrify the world.<br /><br />Perhaps the most disappointing thing about this book is the author's shameless promotion of his other books that fills the last 20% of this book.<br /><br />Then again, it's free so what can you expect??
B007IXWKUK|2.0|I bought all three of the Trilogy on my Kindle but could not finish the stories. I guess it is just not my kind of reading.
B00DB2JQ7W|5.0|Just fabulous! If you like music, do yourself a favor & get this album. Gov't Mule is IMHO the greatest band in the world & Warren Haynes is a true singer/songwriter. The second disc, while the same songs, is totally fresh because the singers who inspired them interpret them differently. What a great concept brought to fruition! The album is topped only by their live shows...which you need to make time in your life to see...
0767919408|4.0|If ever a book should have an accompanying CD, Bill Bryson's \\"One Summer, America 1927\\" is that book.  Cue the music, maestro:<br /><br />-- \\"Seventy six trombones led the big parade,\\" which begins in May with Lindbergh & the first trans-atlantic flights, followed by<br /><br />--\\"Take me Out to the Ball Game,\\" with June's Babe Ruth, and his peerless peers including Lou Gehrig, continuing with<br /><br />-- \\"It's a Grand Old Flag,\\" in which we meet August's vacationing President Calvin Coolidge and those around, before, and after him, concluding with<br /><br />--\\"Darth Vader's March,\\" September & summer's end---whose brutal solemnity echoes Sacco & Vanzetti's lives, the height of the Klu Klux Klan, and the prosecution (& persecution) of anarchists, Fascists, and those thinking differently<br /><br />The almost 500 pages of \\"One Summer, America 1927\\" can hardly contain these events and these men, and it doesn't even try to.  The book is as fractal as the coast of Maine.  A character or theme is introduced: don't go away, it won't have its arc completed where it first appears, but is followed in asides & interludes in succeeding pages.  Like life itself, where happenings are spread out & we just learn to pick up the theme & follow it when it re-appears.<br /><br />There's Henry Ford and his story; the financial gang of four whose summer of 1927 plotting & ploying probably pushed the economy over the cliff in 1929; Clara Bow, that darling girl whose voice sadly for her & us all twanged harshly upon the ear when talkies arrived; the gallant & ambitious & competitive & at times manipulative aviators who did not make it across the Atlantic (peace be on their memories).  And Herbert Hoover, who combined a genius for egotistic self-promotion with extra-ordinary management skill, a fine man for disasters, untouched it would seem with the milk of human kindness.  We elected him president in 1929.  Oh, and Al Capone & the rooting, tooting story of Prohibition and the remarkable woman, lawyer Mabel Walker Willebrandt, who laid him low for income tax evasion.  Leading off? Those ill-fated lovers of the 1927 Sash Weight Murder case.<br /><br />Bryson is the drum major of this parade, high-bouncing, gold-hatted, & be-plummed with curiousity, fascination, a passion for details, and writing his most readable  prose. Stepping back, however, several themes run through:<br /><br />--his love of baseball and the noble science of boxing.  You want to know who else was on Babe's 1927 Yankee team?  Here are their bios, every one (pp. 219-222)with names in bold-face type. And the scores of almost every game, as well as the size & shape of the bat-boy and the changes, intrigues, and drama of baseball's resurrection when the Babe first came to bat.<br /><br />--the sense of America's proud high noon, between the wars, when symbolically with Lindbergh's flight and literally, America become a dominant world force, the leader, and by-and-large, we did so in benign ways<br /><br />--the darkness at noon in America as well as abroad, the virulent anti-Communism, anti-Fascism that saw enemies in butchers and bakers; the more horrible, if this is possible, anti-Semitism that saturated Lindbergh the hero, that imbued Henry Ford, that was almost a common-place in thought and language; and the ugly, cruel, devastating discrimination against African-Americans.<br /><br />\\"One Summer, American 1927\\" can be read lightly, in the human interest of the stories and revelations of let's say unusual details (\\"He liked his head massaged with Vasaline when he was breakfasting\\") and going from the top-of-one-wave to the next in achievements & celebrations.  This is, however, also a book about serious & enduring issues, ones that can slow down the turning page and quiet the ebullient music.<br /><br />\\"What can be said,\\" writes Bryson,summing up Lindbergh with information emerging after his death, \\"is that the greatest hero of the twentieth century was infinitely more of anenigma and considerably less of a hero than anyone had ever supposed.\\" (p.441)  So it goes, for many about whom Bryson writes. Yet, the heroism & the greatness were there too as \\"One Summer, American 1927\\" can help us see.<br /><br />Any negatives? At times, unlike some of Bryson's earlier books, the writing seems stitched together, giving here and there a sense of some cut-and-paste, edited by that high-bouncing drum-major.<br /><br />None-the-less, this is an ambitious, grand, and often wise book from one of our well-loved authors.  \\"American muse,\\" wrote Stephen Vincent Benet in the invocation to his \\"John Brown's Body, \\"whose strong & diverse heart, So many men have tried to understand....\\"  Readers may feel Bryson has invoked this muse and that she has, in her strong & diverse way, answered.enigma and considerably less of a hero than anyone had ever supposed.\\" (p.441)  So it goes, for many about whom Bryson writes.

B000FC1HBY|5.0|Good read. Loved the first. Can't wait to read the third. Would recommend to anyone. Can't put it down. Game of thrones!
630469654X|5.0|I LOVE this movie and I'm so happy to have found it on DVD as it IS from 80's and I'd originally just wanted to rent it.  Places I called said they didn't have it as it was so old.  The only issue I have with it is the music.  It is SO cheesy and totally does NOT correspond whatsoever to the premise of the movie.  Other than that, it's a neat story and the actors are all great.  The REAL reason I wanted to own it though is because of Goliath, the incredible Friesian stallion!
B00380URIO|3.0|This movie was borderline boring because of its slow pace. It was 'ok' to watch, but it wasn't as spectacular as I expected. At some points the movie is quite predictable once you figure out what 'they' are.
B00DHQHAH0|5.0|Awesome show worth the wait I give it five stars both of the seasons so far have been great can't wait till season 3
B009ZQJ0ME|5.0|This is an emotionally filled movie. Emotions is what this movie is and isn't about. Try to figure that one out! Highly recommend you watch it!
B008M721MS|1.0|i did not like it because it said you have to pay for it.I don't have a credit card any way.

0865479410|5.0|I'm a rational and logical person who enjoys life within reason.    There are things that I do for a living and also for recreation that positive thinking will have no bearing on, for example cooking food for many hundreds of people at a time, regularly, and deep sea fishing in a medium sized power boat with family and friends; all of which require knowledge and planing to have a happy end result.    This is why I love this book. It's easy to read and relates lots of ideas well.    There is no reason (unless you have one!) to be unnecessarily glum, but this book helps a person value their own reasoning in life if they are the sort of person who can clearly see that the glass is not half full.    This book has made me happy from just reading it. Trying to explain the ideas to some friends and relatives has been frustrating,  but also reiterates why they do not have the end game responsibilities that I choose.    Positive thinking may make you feel good momentarily but doesn't mean s*** if you haven't properly planned for a situation.    This book doesn't mean you won't be a lucky bastard but ......    D
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This is the answer to my reading problem. Not only that, but now I can have my entire library at my fingertips even if I forget to take my Kindle with me. This type of technology makes it very to reading both enjoyable and possible wherever you are and no matter what device you have.

B0012DP8A6|5.0|Purchased the DVD for my 2 year old neice. SHE LOVED IT! Watched it all the time and learned the songs.
B005LAII12|5.0|A wonderfully cynical and sarcastic take on kids movies and our love affair with teddy bears, I guess.  I had never heard of Seth McFarlane, although I vaguely recall now that he was the one who had trouble at the Oscars or something.  Whoever he is, he has the ability to make a modern day comedy that is consistently funny and I can't think of anyone else doing that right now.  Ted is not for everyone and there are bits that are offensive without having enough of a payoff to justify themselves.  To each his own.  If you want something slightly more tasteful but with no laughs at all there are plenty of other comedies to choose from.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Firefly is the best western in space there is. Joss Whedon does a spectacular job creating characters for you to love.
0449013634|4.0|I don't see any place to review the audiobooks directly so am adding my comments here. All of the Hole books but Nemesis have been read by Robin Sachs. Sachs is a good reader, but he has a British accent! His Hole sounds like a curmudgeonly old Brit. When I listened to Nemesis, oh what a treat. Thor Knai at least sounds Scandinavian to this USAer. His Hole becomes a new figure; much smoother and less maudlin. I wish he had been hired to read all of the books. I have never understood why novels that are so place oriented are read by Brits.
B005PK56TA|5.0|So well written and excellent acting, I don't like to watch scary stuff but this one is a must see!
B0089LOG02|5.0|I am only half way through the book (we are reading itin a book club and we are doing the first half this week.) I can't wait to continue. iIt is a tender, though somewhat sad, story of the beginning of our foster care system.The system still has many problems, but it was really rough in the beginning. love the book!!!
B00EY8A6BC|4.0|entertaining flick! a bit far fetched and hollywood-esque, but if you're looking for a popcorn type movie its worth watching at home
B0090O07S2|4.0|A lot of time and energy has gone into this excellent digital restoration of \\"Live at the Bowl '68\\". An impressive achievement. And as I've commented before, in previous posts on this page, I was one of the cameramen that night, on stage filming Jim with a 16 mm Arriflex 16BL hand held camera.<br /><br />I see in the Product Information section on Amazon's \\"Live at the Bowl '68\\" page, the Director is listed as...The Doors. Well,  the cameramen and the overall film shoot that night was directed by Paul Ferrara. Paul was a classmate of Ray and Jim at UCLA Film School, as I also was, as well as most members of the film crew that night. Paul was working for the Doors, directing the shooting of footage for what would become the film, \\"Feast of Friends\\". The Hollywood Bowl concert was originally shot for inclusion of some of the footage in \\"Feast of Friends\\". And the last sequence of that film is The Doors' performance of \\"The End\\" that night at the Bowl. Paul Farrara was also the cinematographer on Jim's film, \\"HYWAY\\", or \\"HWY\\". Which Paul shot in gorgeous 35 mm  wide screen Eastman Color (I saw the only 35 mm Eastman Color release print a couple of times, in 1970) . \\"HWY\\" seems to have fallen into one of those copyright/ownership black holes, but, of course,  inferior bootleg versions have been posted on You Tube (as have re-edited and re-scored versions of \\"Feast of Friends\\"). Hopefully, some day a digital transfer from the original 35 mm Eastman Color negative (wherever that cut negative is) will someday be available on what will be a visually stunning Blu-ray. Sequences from HWY can be seen in the documentary \\"When You're Strange\\", also available from Amazon. At some time in the early 1970's, Paul sold his percentage of the \\"Feast of Friends\\" film, all the footage shot as well as the finished film, back to the Doors. Which I guess gives them the right to put their name on the Hollywood Bowl concert as...The Director.<br /><br />The Doors' Hollywood Bowl concert is avery good concert. But, the best Doors concert I ever experienced in, a larger venue, was about 2 months later, at the Roundhouse in North London. The Doors played Friday and Saturday nights at the Roundhouse, on a double bill with The Jefferson Airplane. The Doors opened on Friday night, followed by the Airplane. Then The Doors did a second set, and the Airplane closed the show. On Saturday night the Airplane opened, then the Doors, then the Airplane and then the Doors closed the show. The Doors came on very early in the AM of Sunday, after the Underground had stopped running at 11:00 PM. Almost the entire audience stayed, and the Doors played until dawn, and the opening of the Underground on Sunday morning.  That second Doors performance on Saturday night is the very best Doors performance I've ever seen, outside of a club. That performance truly lived up to all the hype of a Doors performance being a shamanistic journey. Unfortunately, it's only available as a DVD transfer from a grainy 16 mm film shot and made by British TV. Not even the complete first Friday night performance. Most likely also available from Amazon.<br /><br />The best Doors' club performance I ever experienced was also the most powerful Doors-performance-as-shamanistic- journey I ever experienced. Which was at the old Ciro's nightclub, on the Sunset Strip, in a concert presented by Kaleidoscope, in Spring 1967. I wish that performance had been filmed, or video taped!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|My son enjoys either watching someone else playing it or when he plays it, it keeps him entertained for hours!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Thank you for the end to an excellent series. I cannot imagine having your imagination , how lucky we all are that YOU chose to share with us!
B003G4W49C|4.0|Loved it ... Love the Sci-fi and fantasy of it .. Now for the next book BOOK 2. ... Gerriger ;))
B006VKKAWQ|5.0|The folks at RCA/BMG/Sony have done this right: dozens of CDs in beautiful packaging housed in a sturdy, space-saving box. Nicely-printed jackets for the individual CDs. I already had a number of these performances on everything from 78s to LPs to earlier CD versions. In every case where I did a comparison, the CDs in this box set offer superior sound. The transfers are &#34;honest&#34; (no artificial stereo), open, and marvelously clear. Toscanini never sounded this good! I've had this box for a few months and have listened to about half of it. There are plenty of CD purchases I've regretted through the years, but this is not one of them. Highly recommended!
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Good matching game. Played it while travelling in car. Don't worry I was a passenger not d driver. It made d travel seem short instead of a boring ride.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|enjoyed this book very much.  it would make a great movie.  I hope everyone who needs hope reads this book.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I first saw this movie at my daughter's house.  It is funny and has great singing.  This is the kind of movie I enjoy getting out and watching it over and over.
0812550706|5.0|Great book! Well paced from beginning to end. The end was a little odd for me but, overall, still a good read.
B00FJU1HLC|5.0|This movie had a lot of laughs for our entire family. I kept my 4 year old entertained from start to finish. He like it so much he wanted to watch again as soon as it was over. I recommend this movie to everyone.
B00DW1WR14|5.0|While Lightning Bolt has a lot of Pearl Jam's classic sound, it is also so very different from anything they've done before and I absolutely love it.  Eddie's singing style has really evolved over the years and he still has such a way of putting so much raw emotion into certain songs that you can `feel his pain'.  Sirens is one of those songs and I can't listen to it enough.  I haven't had a song get to me that much since Black.  One review called the lyrics to Siren \\"sappy\\"... they were wrong Eddie!  I think Mike McCready did an awesome job with the music, and few songs are as honest and heartfelt as this one.<br /><br />I was instantly impressed by Getaway, Infallible and Swallowed Whole also, but I was worried that Eddie was singing a bit out of his vocal range & that he wouldn't be able to do the songs justice when singing them live in concert - boy was I wrong!  This cd is great, but seeing Pearl Jam live is even greater.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon, for making the tracks of Lightning Bolt available as digital downloads for those who pre-ordered the cd.  That was great for me, since I was heading to Worcester, MA on the day of the CD release to see Pearl Jam live in concert, so I got a chance to hear the new songs during my 2 ½ hour drive to the show.
B00AZMFJYA|4.0|not as good as first but fun nevertheless and looking forward to more with greater emphasis on the formula in the original series that worked
B00136NUG6|5.0|gREAT ALBUM BY A GREAT BAND.  Songs are all great and are among all-time favorites.  Will play over and over.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|beginning was interesting, the middle just kinda dragged on and was getting boring, but the ending was fantastic and very intense.
B00C81AVNU|5.0|Saw the show in New York and the music by Cyndi Lauper is fabulous.  Really enjoying listening to the CD.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|At first I was a little put off by the dom/sub thing, and Christians controlling ways. But the more I read the more I grew to love all of the characters. By the last few pages I was so sad to read the end simply because I wasn't ready to be done(I become attached to my book characters). I highly recommend this series!
0385336810|5.0|I really really enjoyed this book. It is so much fun and Emma’s character is so ostentatious that you can’t avoid laugh, cry, get mad, be embarrassed at the same time she is going through all of this.<br />I absolutely loved the way Jack helped Emma to overcome all of her insecurities. He did it in a funny, sexy, caring way….even though he enormously screws things up with everything he said in the TV interview. I was like “Oh please, shut up, just shut up!”<br />And yes, that HUGE mistake of a line he said “just an ordinary, nothing-special girl.” …dude, seriously? Of course we know he didn’t mean to say it as an insult but you know, we are girls, we are going to absolutely take the wrong side of the story first!<br /><br />'I suppose that's because you're so huge and important and I'm – what am I, again, Jack?' I can feel my eyes glittering with tears.<br />'A nothing-special girl? An &#34;ordinary, nothing-special girl&#34;?'<br />Jack winces, and I can see I've hit home. He closes his eyes and for a long time I think he isn't going to speak. 'I didn't mean to use those words,' he says, rubbing his forehead. 'The minute I said them, I wished I could take them back. I was … I was trying to evoke something very different from that’.<br /><br />Yet at the end he says all the right things to makes us…cof, cof, to make Emma realize he really cares about her.<br /><br />He looks up. 'I have you on my mind most of the time. That's the truth; I have you on my mind.'<br /><br />Awww<br /><br />Jack thinks for a moment. 'How about this: anyone who teased you, I'll fire.' This time I can't help giggling out loud.<br />'You won't have a company left.'<br />'So be it. That'll teach me. That'll teach me to be so thoughtless.<br /><br />LOL<br />Perfect!
B00ECLTYOG|3.0|The Hangover part three was a great ending to the trilogy.  I don't but what people say that part two was terrible I loved them all.  I think part three was great and such a ending to the finale
1476715904|5.0|Slammed is just a perfect novel. To me, words aren’t enough to describe how good this book is. I try to go back and remember every inch of the story to pick my favorite scene but I just can’t find one or two or three because I love every single one of them.<br /><br />I can’t think of any book that made me cry as much as Slammed did. Every character in this book adds something unique to the story which makes it even better.<br /><br />I’ve never given much thought to poetry, now I did. The act to just say what you are thinking, feeling, is perfect…just perfect!
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|It's suzh a fantastic movie.  I believe it's the best one out of the three.  Iron man is my favorite avenger.
B008476HBM|5.0|I enjoy reading historical romance books.  This was a bit slower to read, but I did enjoy the story.  I do recommend this book.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|This movie has a very interesting start with somewhat mysterious characters, but as it goes forward the story sort of falls apart. The actors are much better than the plot.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Really hard for me to get into.  Tried to read on a flight to Cancun and just couldn't! Then I tried again at the beach :( Too bad, on best seller?!
1250038820|5.0|I follow the facebook page and enjoy it daily but seeing all the wonderful photos along with the simple yet eloquent commentary in book form is just wonderful.  Well done Brandon Stanton.
B009E3EY38|5.0|Sometimes you just have to do it. Crank up the stereo and go back in time. I am completely hooked on watching Jimmy Page play guitar.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Love how JJ Abrams has moved the franchise from schlock to more entertaining action thriller comedy drama (is that a category?)  Great visuals, love how they are still able to incorporate some of the past character references from the movie and the original series (tribbles anyone?)
B00FDSV4TA|4.0|Long time STP fan. Chester sounds great. Sounds like Scott would rather be high then make music. At some point your chances are over and people get tired of the BS.
B004JN1CW4|4.0|This was the best book in the series. It tied up a lot of loose ends, and it had action galore. It is a book worth reading, but it is a little freaky at times so just be aware.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Great show for the bad boy/girl  part of you. Little gruesome sometimes. But Sam crow can run with the best.
B004H4XI5O|5.0|I'm a grad student and this book helped me a lot. I bought the audio version too, I'm also a very mommy, listened to it everywhere I went. I recommend listening to it/reading it with an open mind, follow the &#34;excercises&#34; the author say and have fun with it and you will get the most out of this book. I am Egyptian and growing up I always heard how Arabs were notoriously known for their memory of reciting poems and later hadiths said by prophet and Quran and when they went back to write down eveything everybody recited the same thing verbatim!!! That's amazing. Hoping these techniques will continue to better my memory always:-)
B0015AARJI|4.0|My sons liked very much this and it's easy to use and charge also, I recomment you to order it.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Great read. Definitely worth the time if your looking for a great series to keep you hanging on to every word.
B00129H7VS|5.0|The story, actors, production quality of this series are fantastic!  Helps me always remember what our men and women in our military sacrifice for our country and for all Americans.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This really works when streaming movies and television.  Our Samsung SmartTV was supposed to do this but for reasons not clear to me it did not.  Great device.  I am looking forward to cancelling the cable TV soon as this provides alternate programming.  Hopefully, Google will enhance and expand the capabilities of this Chromecast device.  Rate high on buy!
B00B52FDXQ|4.0|The first season with Andy Whitfield is still my favorite, but I got hooked on this series and had to watch all of them.
B002O3Z50G|5.0|Love, love this movie. Although movie graphics have come a long way since 1996, it was still a very good movie in my personal opinion.
B000FQIRXQ|4.0|I loved seeing actors that I new from Harry Potter in this version. The acting was great and I will watch it again and again.
B008JFUQZ2|5.0|This movie was incredible! Very emotional and also action packed! I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who loves kaiju type movies! Get it, because you'll enjoy it!
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I couldn't stop watching it. I love Spock and his showing his human side. The characters that played Jim Kirk, Scottie, Sulu, Spock, Uhura, and Bones were amazing.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|It does a great job sharpening. Go figure. I did not run into any of the problems posted by others (it wouldn't sharpen it very well, made my blade more dull,etc) and have ascribed those observations to them not knowing how to use it, properly. Puts a very fine edge on my blades, and is very portable. If it breaks I'll buy another one to replace it.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I've been playing this game and I just love it.  It is very easy to play. What I love most of all, it is FREE!!!
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Best app I've found and both daughters have it on their phone so now they just do all their printing on my printer. Lol saves their ink.
B00E72OKAS|5.0|Please check on my spelling. Ok this game is So addictive I can't stop playing it and I'm so good I got to the Second level in 2 MINUTES!!!! I would like it a lot if almost every one got this app it is the Best APP EVER !!!!!!!!
034580709X|4.0|Finally, the first in the Harry Hole series.  Nesbo gets better with time, but if you are a fan, you have to read this.
B00FAEPX9Y|5.0|If you're a fan or Royals, you will enjoy this.  Not a bad song in the bunch.  Definitely worth purchasing, highly recommended.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Very good adaptation of the Sherlock Holmes character. Mr. Cumberbacht nails it.  Watson is a little shaky of a character at times, but overall a good watch.
B00DV2D0JC|5.0|Another fine hidden objects mystery from G5. Can't complain. Good graphics, good story length. I got it on sale for 99cents. Can't say I'd pay 4.99 for it, but I have a hard time paying more than 1.99 for any game.
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|This has to be one of the best movies of all time! Not a line wasted in this movie. If you like film and you haven't seen The Goodfellas, you're truly missing out!
B0065GC0BA|5.0|&#34;Me before you&#34; was one of the most moving, thought-provoking and insightful stories I have read. I did not want this book to end. The characters and their difficult predicament were portrayed so convincingly and I found myself thinking about them long after I finished reading it. I was reluctant to leave this book from the very beginning and I felt a real void when it ended.
B002DQDV6Y|4.0|Purchased this for my 9-year old grandson....we had watched the first Harry Potter movie together.  He kept saying how much better this one was than the first.  Love that kid!  I probably would not have watched this series without him.  I enjoyed it also.
B004I744AS|5.0|The free dictionary really helps me when it comes to school!without this app I would have to get on the internet to look up words. With this app I don't need to get on th web  to search my words. All. I.have to do is click on the app and search words.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|With the Swype like keyboard, this thing has really been a pleasure to use, not to mention that I feel like the text prediction has gotten a lot better.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|What an improvement from the stock swype keyboard. I highly suggest anyone who has trouble with their stock keyboard to try this one out!
B009LMTDL0|4.0|An easy read, current!  We now need to Lean In for the minority women and smash those ceilings! We are making progress
B005HSL626|5.0|Free game that my daughter loves.  It improves your reflex skills and makes you really pay attention.  Great game She plays all the time more.
B002E2M5IC|3.0|Being a big Coen brothers fan, I had no problem with plunking down the eight bucks for the Blu-Ray.  Well cast, well acted, well written.  I watched it with my wife and a friend, neither of whom seemed to be enjoying the film, which became a distraction for me.  I was able to understand the film and how the main character's problems related to one another, as well as the whole \\"fate\\" thing. I found the film entertaining, but a little uneven.  However, I will watch it again (as I do with many films to get more out of them), alone this time.  I had a little trouble with the prologue, and how it pertained to the rest of the film, as well as the abrupt ending with seemingly no resolution, which was perhaps the point.  Great use of music.  Great production design.  I can see however why it was not a smash, like Fargo or The Big Lebowski.
B006M7JCC2|3.0|Her story was amazing and miraculous, but for me being Catholic, I was disappointed that there was scarce a mention of God.  The overwhelming love that she felt on the other side is what God is and that is comforting. Her back story I did find to be interesting and the medical miracle that befell her.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|It is a concise and thought-provoking book that aims to begin a conversation about the role and power of women in this country - conversations in families, among friends, and in the workplace.  Well-written book that features compelling research.
B00BRUPICM|5.0|Interestingly written (translated from French) and not easy to figure out how it might end. However, it's difficult to understand how the French inspector rose to such heights in law enforcement since he is built very close to the sidewalk and probably couldn't scare a flea.
B00F9040HU|5.0|Love this game...I knew you had to buy it if you wanted to play the full game. Thanks for the entertainment!!!!!
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|This has a scary premise that is easy enough to believe so it was hard to put down. The characters and dialogue are a wee bit flat and all seem to have the same personality. That may have been the Circle's mission.
B00COO2D6O|5.0|Awesome really fun to play, challenging and engaging, I'd recommend this game to just about everyone.  Everybody should have a chance to experience all that is good about this game
B00003CXA6|4.0|Great war movie depicting the battle that changed the tide of the war between the states. A must see for civil war history fans.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Khalid Hosseini ,once again, spins the story with exceptional ease of reading while peaking one's curiosity. Loved how the characters were brought together. I was saddened at times but found the characters endearing and their human experiences were very believable.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Keeps me informed of weather changes as they occur. Better info enables me to better plan out door activities. A great tool.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|does every thing I need it to do.<br />great app!!!!!  easy to use. would get it again in a heartbeat.
B000021Y7X|5.0|Dance in the living room and sing along ... it never gets old! You just can't beat jammin to David Byrne!
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|I love the differences in handling for each plane. Especially as the years progress. Can't wait for the upper levels
0385349947|5.0|This book is so inspiring and spot on!  I can't put it down ... it makes me sad that I'll be done with it soon.  I only hope that Sheryl Sandberg has another one in the works.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|The downside is that few apps so far support it. And it doesn't cast local media.  More work is needed to catch up with other similar products.
B00EGMQIJ0|1.0|The concept of the book showed promise and potential: unfortunately, the writing was so trite, stilted and juvenile that I lost interest fairly quickly. I have a promise with myself:  if I buy a book, I have to finish it. I had to compromise with this one:  the last half I simply skimmed and it just went on and on; thought I would never get to the last page. Don't bother with this one.
B00AB55BS0|5.0|I will add more to this review later, suffice it to say, I've always been a sci-fi person, and the world of A song of ice and fire de-throned sci-fi forever as the best fiction I've ever read/watched.
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|You can never see too many Iron Man. Great movie with just enough action, and storyline. No need to see it in HD.
B00C5R7F8G|3.0|IMHO there were wayyyyy too many names of characters that were introduced that contributed nothing to the narrative. You need your own Eniac computer to keep track of all the characters. There were also sections where I thought the author got a little preachy. This book is 99.99% historical facts and right in the middle of it all Schlosser decides to give us his personal opinions. It stuck out like a sore thumb.<br /><br />The book is a very heavy read. I thought it would be more about various blunders that were made throughout history in respect to the handling of nuclear weapons. Instead there was basically one story about that and the whole rest of the book was a bunch of very boring history of what happened in the 50's.
B00D23GXB2|5.0|Wow this collection of poetry is a must have in ur collection. Don't be fooled by the title. This a sensual book of well written poetry will have you wanting to touch yourself by the time u get to the last page. This is the first book that I have read by this author but it won't be the last
B000HZGNHW|4.0|When I saw the new version of this movie I wanted to go back and see the first one that I remember as a child. I had always love the scene where the cars go to the roof of a building it was save in my brain since I was nine. Go back to your time and remember by seeing this movie again.
B007URVZJ6|3.0|This guide defines the format for Kindle books. If your book fits the format, fine. If not, the book is not very useful. Specifically, if your book is all (mostly) text, this guide is useful. If heavy on numbers and tables, Kindle may not be your best outlet. In summary, if you want &#34;To Kindle&#34;, this book is a MUST!
B00BVMXBVG|5.0|So glad this show has a fantastic following!! This will tide me over until Season 2 in April 2014. BUY IT!!!
B00DJWV11I|4.0|writing was great and Loved the story...Not so serious, but at the same time it was in the areas that needed to be.  Nice twist of a love story.
B006LG7O38|5.0|Great take on the original Fright Night movie. I think this movie is better than the first. The effects were very realistic.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Argh, it's so addictive! Good graphics, nice obstacles that are well placed, and it really challenges your reflective skills. 5 stars from this girl.
140006922X|5.0|The author makes a clear and fascinating distinction between the historical Jesus and the messianic Jesus. He also describes the differences among the apostles, their contributions to the Jesus myth, the historical context in which all of this took place. He differentiates between Jesus and his band of uneducated peasants, who wanted to bring to the Jews a more fair and honorable way of life, and the later Gospel writers, and preachers, who were speaking to the non-Jewish world about a new religion that would bring more power to the wealthy and educated. It is always refreshing to get a broad view from a new perspective on something we are so familiar with, we take it for granted.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Very classy. Much different from the main stream TV these days. Nice trip to the world just 100 years ago, yet so different. Meticulously made and well played
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|Have the entire set of Jesse Stone -- great series of movies -- good to rewatch in sequence.
B000I9X67M|4.0|I use in my classroom for a project and it turn out to be what I was looking for. This movie shows what doing the right thing is always the the right way
0812550706|5.0|i hadn't read this book in quite a long time. with the movie coming out i figured it was time to refresh myself and give it another read, and it was a good price here
0062278096|5.0|Absolutely brilliant. Adams takes the voice of Watson and Sherlock so well you can practically hear the pair as you read it.
B00005JKED|5.0|Ah, what a great film it is and what a prodigious actor is Denzel Washigton. I knew later that it was an Oscar nominé. This film let me shocked. The plot is unusual and the ending....superbly.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Eugenia
B00C061I3K|5.0|Great songs. CD looks great. Exactly what I wanted. Didn't get any less than what I expected. I love it. (:
B000A3VTT8|5.0|Once upon a time, M. Jean Pierre Ponelle was my teacher .And,eventhough I had aredy seen the Cenerentola, it always delights me greatly, it is really unbelievable how can we enjoy opera, and this one was exquisite. The quality of reproduction is excellent, the images superb. And Araiza, Montarsolo and dear Frederica von Stade are enourmous in this performane. I recommend it to every one of your Opera's lovers.<br />Eugenia
B00EGMQIJ0|3.0|Other reviews have adequately summarized the story, and the simplistic, readable way it is told. I can oniy add that you can see around the corners the writer erects. Little happens in this book that is surprising.<br /><br />I would like to see this book required reading as early as 6th or 7th grade. where I do not think these issues are adequately discussed. I know I read this book on a Kindle, and Amazon knows how long it took me to read it, what I highlighted, and how to collate my purchase of this book with other purchases to offer me other goods it thinks I might buy. I am not sure that most kids that post, text, email, petition, Facebook. and whatever else get that they are leaving breadcrumbs behind that will leave a record of everywhere they have been Nor do I think they understand it is not the government, or just the government, they should be on guard against, but everyone they communicate with digitally. This book might be a great way to get that across to those who cannot figure that out on their own.
B00ECUARO8|1.0|I was not impressed with this movie, I watched it because the reviews weren't bad, but I was very displeased the kids talk like raunchy and everything about  the young lady in the movie, and some of the review so that it was clean and no cussing, and that's not the case I would not recommend the movie to anyone, no point to movie.
0307155102|5.0|This was a favorite of our children and now it's becoming the same for our newest grandson.  Some things really do get better with age.  And it's a BOOK, not a noise-maker.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|We set this up on a friend's router and took the device home and it now is powered through our mobile devices. Which we were not expecting due to the extensive reviews we read and phone call we made to Chromecast. We were told it wouldn't work on our phones by someone at the company, but she must not have known what she was talking about because one of the advertisements says you can use it with your mobile device in hotels and whatnot when there isn't great connectivity to the internet, so we just dug until we figured it out on our own.<br /><br />It does have a few bugs with how I am using it, which I am sure isn't the norm for other users. The only thing I don't like much about it is that it tends to lose the network here and there in between videos or pauses. The only thing that I have found to work when this happens is unplugging it from the tv and rebooting the internet as well and then for some reason I have to go through the chromecast app on the computer and set it up to recognize my password protected internet, but I can't complain since it is only $35.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|ORIGINAL REVIEW: It is inexpensive and quality built. It performs exactly as advertised. I realize that it is brand new, but I hope to see more choices of viewing for it. I would recommend it to everyone.<br /><br />UPDATE: 11/13/2014 After having this since it came out, I have to now say, it is not very useful, practical, or cutting edge. It is far out done by the Roku 3 for one. I thought it was cheap at $39 when I purchased it, but now I think I wasted the money. To have been out for as long as it has, there are still not near enough channels or uses for it.
B00FN811SY|5.0|The most advanced publisher of Study aids, personal research. This is the most understood translation of the Bible, everything translated from the original Hebrew and Greek scriptures with the correct meaning and accurate! So easy to navigate to the correct book and verse, also for different scriptures relating to the same topic.<br />Thanks, Amazon for having this available for &#34;Free&#34; to download!<br />And Most of all, I thank God for this every time I open this.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|One of the best shows I have ever seen. As is the case with most British productions, it was far superior to typical American programs. Well written, well acted, well directed. All around fantastic. I would recommend it to anyone.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Love the characters. It's well written with lots of little quirks that you come to appreciate over time.  The women are hot and smart, a lethal combination.
B000TBAI0W|5.0|My 1 year old daughter received this for her 1st birthday. She is standing unsupported but hasn't yet taken her first step.  As soon as this was assembled, she took a hold of the bar and started walking with it! No learning curve at all.  The little rubber strip in the wheels does a great job of keeping it from running away from her on the wooden floors. It is really solid and heavy and not easy to tip over, even with my 24lb girl tugging on the handle. I hadn't seen this model before and was coveting the Melissa and Doug crocodile clacker walker but I like this one so much more.  The blocks and abacus mean it will have a longer use than a straightforward walker.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|great game. easy to use. lose track of time easily. takes a while to earn back energy though. fun fun
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|More than a single, fascinating event, this explores the whole era of our nuclear arsenal as viewed from the mind-set of the era and why the decisions and misses evolved into risks still in existence today.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|After doing the recommended underwater test without my phone in the sealed case, I have been camping in the rain and mud and I like how I didn't have to worry about having my phone out in the elements.  The case is light weight and as it says in the ads, slides easily into a pocket.  I am not sure that the ring volume sounds as loud as it did without the case, but it's not enough of a difference to worry about.  You will need to make sure your chargers are the size of the original Apple shape because some will not fit into the port on the bottom of the phone.  This cover does not take away from the size of your viewing screen or any of your actions and I highly recommend it.
B00CF34B2I|2.0|This is a very fun game, when it doesn't crash. I have played it extensively on my iPad mini, where it has crashed nearly every time I have played it since I downloaded ios7.<br /><br />I then gave up playing it there and downloaded it to my Samsung S4 and the 1st game I played, I lost, the app ran perfectly. I then played 2 more games in which I stomped the AI, only to have the app crash as it was recording my victory
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|This app is pretty legit I'm most impressed with how it actually has a video recording function most apps don't offer that and when they do it isn't compatible with kindle fire HD. Thank you for the well rounded app that actually does what it says lol very nice!!
B00F2LIV4E|3.0|Would be nice if they would focus more on the killer riffs they do so well with and less time on the same tired old looney tune pyrotechnics that Petrucci and Rudess has been overly absorbed with so much especially of late. Mangini coming along fine and Labrie sounding as good as ever but at points he could be brought up a little in the mix. Seems they are purposefully trying to over-complicate the music more with each release, like they feel a need to one-up themselves and their clones.
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|The print book has an illustration of the Titan silo. Why wasn't there one with Kindle version? It would have required only a couple of more pages!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|There really isn't a way this story can end well, but I think the author did a great job of illustrating the trials and tribulations associated with being a teenager in today's world and then adds the burden of cancer on top of that.  I cannot imagine what children like these go through everyday, dealing with things that no child should have to, then having to be a &#34;normal teen&#34; on top of that.  I loved the characters and wished I could spend more time with them.
B001UAX56A|5.0|I first heard this CD when I was a lot younger and the songs have been in my head since. Now older I really appreciate the lyrics of each track. Good back then, GREAT NOW!! TIMELESS MUSIC
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Simple to install on your TV -- just plug it in.  Installation on iPad/PC was just as simple -- download and install.  Automatically detected devices.<br /><br />Now I just open my iPad for Netflix, instead of starting xBox, signing in, blah blah blah.  Much smoother and faster.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is cool most games are boring but this one is cool and I'm glad it is a hunting game
B003WE9TU8|5.0|Dare I say it?  The book was much better than the movie!  You can't even compare the two, and goodness knows why they changed it so much.<br /><br />The book would appeal to your intellectual zombie fan, as it goes deep into the why, how, and how the war was won.<br /><br />Great read.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is a must read. Defiantly read the first and second books first but this book is awesome! I can't wait till the movie comes out!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|First my objective was to match all the tiles, then the game became a game of time---racing through the matches as fast as possible to get three stars on every level.  Challenging!

B000WTXCZO|5.0|Newly remastered and a crystal clear live recording. Sounds so much better than my old vinyl from the early 70's.
B00B5JBZGS|3.0|At first I hated this album. Just the thought of it not being howard anymore made me mad. But let me say this. It was great!<br /><br />The original singer really stepped it up and this album was amazing!!!
B0084AZXKK|4.0|Fun and awesome<br />Dinomite<br />Some of it is violent  that's why I put 4 stars<br />Not for children under 7 years old
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|GREAT GAME.<br />MY KIDS LOOOOOVE IT!  THEY ARE 9 & 12 YEARS OLD.<br />IT IS THERE FAVORITE GAME TO PLAY ON SMART PHONES AND KINDLE FIRES.<br />AND IT IS FREE!!!
B00BN4JQ6G|5.0|It was everything I hoped for and the person receiving it was thrilled. KOL is one of our favorite groups and this was a perfect gift!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Usually this type of book disappoints, but not this one.  For those of us in the new age field for multiple decades it isn't new, but a different twist that makes it new, and changes the mind set.  For me, if butterflies were $100 bills I'd be a millionaire. I recently moved, and didn't know this area was home to monarch butterflies in the fall and winter!  Great book!
B00AYPXG5W|4.0|Loved that this was based on real events, that made this movie much more interesting.  If you like alien movies then you will love this one.
B00EO10JES|1.0|And the flash is wasted. All I can think about is her coated tongue sticking out all the time. How can anyone be taken seriously as a singer like that. The less I hear about her, the better.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I play this game over and over. I have beaten it probably 10 times by now. It is a great time waster for those of us who enjoy sliding puzzle type games.
B008X9Z3UC|4.0|Absolutely love this case, Kindle fire fits perfectly. This case says it will only fit the Kindle Fire HD 7\\", however it does fit the Fire 7\\" non HD as well as my first generation 7\\" Fire. It will not fit the 8.9' Kindle. It is sleek and stylish it has a soft interior liner that protects the touchscreen. It has dual zippers allow for easy access and keeps my Kindle Fire safe! I would definitely recommend this case!
B00BS3EMNY|5.0|Love Caro! I can't get enough of her style. The mix of old school and new is just intoxicating. I make everyone I know listen to her music as well!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is a wonderful app, especially for being free! It has man features and is easy to navigate through, this app is by far the best alarm clock app I have ever used!
B00AE4OGCU|5.0|Generally, Swedish novellists seem to help have an understated style that I enjoy. Specifically, this book had wonderful characterisation and a believable, entrancing topic.
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|Simple enough for my toddler to get the hang of it and entertaining enough to keep my husband and me playing. Just very repetitive and I get bored easily.
B007SGM084|3.0|The story was weak and the sex got boring after a few pages.  I hope the movie is better. bla...
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|By profession I was an Architectural Designer, working for both Architects and Engineers. I've owned and worked using the most advanced technologies... CALCULATOR PLUS FREE IS AS GOOD AS ANY OF THEM AND I HAVE IT DOWNLOADED IN MY SMART PHONE AS WELL AS MY KINDLE FIRE. I highly recommended it!
B00EY8BRGU|1.0|You spend the entire movie wondering &#34;wtf&#34;. The story line has so many holes in it. Don't waste your money.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|My Facebook app kept freezing up, so I uninstalled it and tried to download it again in an attempt to fix the problem. Now, I'm unable to download the app at all. It keeps saying there is an error in the installation process
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I loved how this all weaved together. The flower dictionary at the back is going to be used a lot
B00E8G5HDW|5.0|Big fan of the The Clone Wars, sorry this is the last season, glad I got it, though. Will miss it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Really good app. I know it's only a calculator but a very good one. Nice display and key  features.  No need to worry about  hitting 2 keys at one time. I have large hands and it works for me very well.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Fall asleep easy.  Relaxation beyond my expectations.  Many options without being overwhelming and they inspire memories of other calming times.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I was never able to play the game. It took to long to load and ran very slow on my Kindle fire. It may work better with other devices.
B003HARV3Y|4.0|The shipping was great on the time. I have also had no problem with the DVD yet. The movie is a great movie which is why I bought it in the first place. Good story line and action to go with it. Good product for a good price right now.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|too crowded and to invasive and slow. Deleted my account for Google+. Yeah i know what people say there is no one on there. Right now half of my family likes it better than facebook.
B000JZ3TYA|5.0|EXCELLENT MOVIE!!  I've seen it MANY. MANY times and never get tired of it!  Fun to watch it with other people and get their reactions and comments throughout the movie! I never get tired of it!!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Very good special effects its a must own for any family with kids. 3d is good also but not really needed.
B000001ES9|4.0|No three guys have done what these three have done-This was before Neil, I know but the concepts and the power was present then and has only gotten greater.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Nice app that is super easy to set up and use. The graphs are a nice touch so you can see heat index and real feel temp.
B000WS4PCO|5.0|This is one of the best albums in the history of rock and roll and I can not stop listening to it 27 years later!
B001UGB1X8|4.0|This was a pretty good movie. Tommy Lee Jones always has very interesting movie roles. I'd recommend it for viewing.
B00000DFSK|1.0|It was a band called Propaganda and they were not my kind of music listening. I gave it to some one else.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Awesome app don't have to spend a lot of money to win its just fun,  hubby and I play together.
0307595579|1.0|The Stieg Larsson Trilogy<br /><br />Stieg Larsson, a journalist, wrote three novels before his early death. They were published and then adapted into movies. There was the usual publicity to promote these foreign language films as some kind of entertaining or educational experience. They are not! While you might watch one of these, all three are worse than any one (negative synergy). They promise a story about a muck-raking magazine that exposes fascist sympathizers, serial killers, gun running, dope smuggling, pornography, and prostitution. But nothing about the tax evasion that accompanies these criminal enterprises. There isn't much of a scandal for an \\"anything goes\\" big metropolitan society. Many scenes are set in a rural small town. Is that believable?<br /><br />\\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" has some X-rated scenes to shock or attract an audience. Parts seems derived from \\"The Big Sleep\\" (wealthy industrialist seeks a missing person), \\"Chinatown\\" (wealthy individual exploits a female relative), and \\"Roseanne\\" (finding the killer of a young woman). Larsson did enhance this combination, but the idea of a serial killer in a small rural village seems incredible. \\"The Changeling\\" was based on a true story.<br /><br />\\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\" makes a heroine out of a violent mentally-ill young woman, who somehow becomes a millionaire swindler through her computer hacking. [Didn't \\"The Sting\\" have a similar story?] I find this incredible, most hackers are soon caught because of controls. This action movie has the usual scenes (car chase for action, a super-villain like from an Ian Fleming novel, characters who pop up to provide bodies or action). There are no prosecutions for the crimes.<br /><br />\\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" is the end of this series. Lisbeth is the main character now, and shows the investigative skills of a private detective (\\"The Maltese Falcon\\"). There is a small independent conspiracy who covered up the crimes of a ColdWar defector (\\"Operation Paper Clip\\"?). Some parts are educational, like planting evidence (drugs and money) to frame an independent journalist. It exposes a paid government expert witness who commits prosecutorial perjury in testifying on Lisbeth's sanity. [Doesn't this happen in other places?] Somehow, Lisbeth remains drug-free in spite of her aberrant lifestyle. Believable?<br /><br />At the end there are no prosecutions for the crimes alleged to have occurred (gun running, dope smuggling, pornography, prostitution). I thought Sweden was ruled by its aristocracy and big industrialists against the common people (who suffer from the usual high taxes). I remember the books of Per Wahlöö and Maj Sjöwall as being more entertaining and educational.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This show is well written and acted. Excellent ensemble cast. Can't wait to see each episode. It is thoroughly enjoyable
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Love this game! Very realistic and addictive. I would recommend this game to anyone! I can't stop playing it. I have really enjoyed it
0544104404|4.0|I never read the book. Bought it for my daughter who has young children. I did read a very good review about it and assume I would have liked it. There should be a space for comments on gift6 purchases.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|Good book, easy read. Got hooked so now reading the sequel. Cute love story between two high school sweethearts. The writer does a great job of switching back and forth from present to past without making it confusing.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a pretty easy one compared to some others I've seen. Wish there where more levels. Guess it's time to find a new game.
0803726570|1.0|After checking out this book from the library, my son was requesting it daily.  We couldn't wait to add it to our personal library permanently, but when it arrived, the text was different from the version we had grown to love.<br /><br />Instead of the adorable text:<br />\\"A witch with french fries tastes delicious to me!\\" and \\"Just this once I'll have witch WITHOUT fries!\\"<br />we found the unappetizing text:<br />\\"And you, witch, look like a good supper to me\\" and \\"He said, 'I won't let you go, do you think I'm a fool?'\\"<br /><br />Say what?!<br /><br />Others have experienced the same thing, so please go and look at a physical copy in a book store instead of ordering through Amazon if you want to be guaranteed the original (and far superior!) version.<br /><br />This copy is going back to Amazon, and I've already talked to Barnes and Noble about getting the correct version.  It's worth the extra 3 bucks. The original version gets a perfect 5 star rating, but we are completely disappointed in what Amazon shipped to us.
1603580557|5.0|Ms. Meadows has written a book that is accessible to all, and useful to all who do not already know this material. She gives the basic concepts (stock, flow, 2 types of feedback) necessary to begin to understand what a dynamic system is and how to think about it (they're everywhere, you can't get away from them; they're important, they run the world), and then by concrete and important examples shows their importance in our lives. Some of her examples are very counter-intuitive!<br />Read the book (your library may have a copy), then write your own review!
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|this game was great until it jumped from like 8000 to 800000 for land expansion. It takes months to save if you cant afford to buy with real cash!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Couldn't put it down!!!!!!  Everyone can in some way relate to it.  Loved the ending it was not at all what I expected
B0034KZE9U|4.0|Well, I wish I would have read more reviews on this product, as just like many people have already said in reviews, when buying these clogs you should definitely go a size down from what you normally wear in 'regular' shoes. I bought a size 12 Unisex Bistro Clog for a job I just acquired in food service that required slip-resistant black shoes. They are very comfortable and I'm sure they're worth the $28 I paid for them with free shipping, just wish I got an 11 instead of a 12. If everything goes well I'm sure I'll end up ordering another pair in 4-6 months, if things go even better maybe a year? Either way I'll be getting a smaller size next time. Awesome 2-day shipping, thanks Amazon!
B00CTT9646|1.0|These are made of resin with a poor finish that comes right off. The resin is also very, very fragile. Mine was glued 7 times before being turned into a mold for a true replica.
B00402FGEE|3.0|I will try to not duplicate others' reviews but this series was painful to watch. The writers and producers obviously didn't do their homework. The military doesn't operate without a contingency plan for every possible scenario and in the case of SGU they would have been prepared for an emergency evacuation and would have had everything they needed pre-staged close to the Gate so all the evacuees would have to do is go to the prestage area and grab a bugout bag and other gear and go. Instead for the sake of drama they just grabbed what they could get their grubby little paws on and ran for the Gate. Fortunately they had the forsight to grab the communication stones instead of more copying paper.<br /><br />From a logistics standpoint unless they were able to grab the entire armory's inventory of ammo and reload gear and supplies their weapons would've been totally useless after the first firefight but they seemed to have grabbed the magic Hollywood weapons that never run out of ammo.<br /><br />Unless everone was prescreened to have no medical conditions, all those people with existing conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure would've soon started dieing due to their condition starting to rapidly progress with no medication to keep it under control. From the looks of it, most of those characters were under some kind of medication.<br /><br />They did get the air supply fixed in the pilot which would've made for a very short series had they not but since this was a series I would've had a different storyline to focus on with the air scrubbers being a non issue since my Ancients would've not had that flawed system had I been the writer/producer.<br /><br />There are many other technical flaws but too many to go into.<br /><br />I was hoping the character development would've been quicker but it just dragged to the very painful end with very little development. From what I could tell they were all pathetic social rejects with no skills other than whining and crying at every minor inconvenience that presented itself.<br /><br />The infighting between the military and civilian leadership was ludicrous.  Again, in a real life scenario there would've been clear procedures for the chain of command with the mixed community which would've prevented the attempted civilian takeover which was due to a lack of communication and trust not to mention mediocre writing.<br /><br />All these problems were addressed and taken care of in a much believeable way in SG-1.ying at every minor inconvenience that presented itself.<br /><br />The infighting between the military and civilian leadership was ludicrous.

B00CO8D3G4|5.0|Great Book one of the best I have read recently ... And I am hard to please - Trust me!!!
B004IFYMWK|5.0|Fair Game is more of a documentary than a movie. It details how Congress was duped by the Bush/Cheney Administration into approving war with Iraq due to their Weapons of Mass Destruction, which proved to be a lie because there were no WMD. Before the war began, Joe Wilson, our Ambassador to Iraq, aggressively searched for WMD, but found none. He sent letters about no WMDs to the Administration and even to Bush personally, but to no avail. Frustrated, he personally took out a large ad in the New York Times telling about his search and finding no WMDs. This of course angered Bush and Cheney, and they had personal and secret information about Wilson's wife, a CIA operative in Iraq made public. This disclosure put an end to Wilson's wife's CIA career and likely caused the murders of Iraqis she was working with. Disclosing secret government information is a treasonable offense, which at a minimum should lead to imprisonment or possibly execution, but for this act and for even worse, the Iraq/Afghanistan War, Bush, Cheney and their cohorts are still free and honorable??? men. To protect themselves, Bush and Cheney had virtually all of their Administration's communications stamped SECRET ! Check it all out on the Internet.
1250038820|5.0|Not only is this a great book (and blog), it also helps to inspire people to follow their dreams and passions just as Stanton did. Had he not taken a hugh risk to create HONY, this could have been just another vanished vision.  I will be purchasing more as gifts for the holidays.
B007SGM084|5.0|The best book I have read. I love how at times I felt as they were talking to me. I recommend this book to everyone I come across.
1572815108|4.0|I saw them for the first time in the Venice Art Biannual this year in the Italian Pavilion and bought the set for the beauty of the art work on the cards. I have a special connection with Crowley as I studied his connections and exchange of  letters with the writer Fernando Pessoa that I admire. Therefore I was very happy knowing that those cards could be bought. I am not familiar with the tarot and so from that point of view I cannot judge.
B00CKKDZ2S|5.0|This app is so cool! I just got it today and its so amazing. I wonder if the message that they gave me will be helpful tomorrow.
B00F52YOPA|5.0|Each level is entertaining and the graphics are excellent.  I have been playing off and on for awhile and have yet to become bored by the challenge.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I own knifes made by Chris Reeves, Bud Nealy, Dozer, Bussie and Emerson,  along with the Benchmades, Buck, Gerber, Spyderco etc. I bought this knife because my son was using my knifes and just having lost a Dozer myself I was concerned I'd end up losing another high dollar knife.  Previously I had bought my son a Winkler knife but he needed a knife with more weight to it.  After researching many magazines, survival forums etc, I noticed the BK2 mentioned often.  The price was much lower than my other knives so I felt I'd give it a try so I orderd one.  If you don't have one, get one.  This knife is heavy duty and I absolutely love it.  It's actually a tool, pry bar with a nice edge on it.  If I do break this knife I must really be in some deep troubles because it's a real chunk of steel.  I haven't actually sharpened it yet although we've used it many times in the woods,  my own test just to see how long the edge last, it came razor sharp.  So that's my personal input on this knife,  I love it!!!!
B00DHHWXYY|5.0|Love it. Very nicely done.Leonardo Dicaprio shines as the eccentric Gatsby.  Toby McGuire excellent part as well. Loved the extras on the discs.

B00AXVIBKW|5.0|once again, the california punk band comes through with another amazing album. bad religion is one of the few bands that consistently puts out great music. i have loved everything of theirs since suffer, and true north is no exception. it has great punk rhythm and good hooks, and as always, concise meaningful lyrics. 5 stars.

B004HW7JH4|5.0|This series continues to inspire with its wonderful story lines, character development, costumes and settings.  I am enthralled, as usual, by its realistic yet amusing, tales of the world of advertising in the 1960s.

B0049J3QF4|5.0|This movie was really crisp, good quality and no lag or breaks in the movie. Also the loading time was very fast, I would say about 5 seconds for it to come up with no more buffering from then on.

B00E8KLWB4|3.0|There isn't much in the way of directions so some of the bonuses are under utilized. Pretty good for free but my free options will probably run out before too long.
B005GY0Y8S|3.0|I liked that the book starts right in with the story.  It keeps you guessing to the very end who the killer is and why. I enjoyed reading this book. Will read her other books by this author.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I enjoy this game immensely. When it is hard, it is very hard, but most puzzles are comfortably within reach world being too easy.

This book is the story of two &#34;orphans&#34;, one who road the train in her childhood and now is 91 years old and a foster child now a rebellious teenager.  Their interaction brings each of them closer to each other and a deeper understanding of their own lives.
B00F880BWG|4.0|A great season opener! builds the tension for what the rest of the season holds without letting too much be revealed. SFX are improving, but starting to lean towards genre over the topedness where gore is concerned.
031623480X|4.0|I had already accepted wheat as the not so good for you food and had eliminated it from our diet, so this wasn't too far out there for me. Since we dropped wheat, I've noticed improvements in my joints and a reduction in swelling (which I didn't even know I had until it left). My daughter had always had stomach issues - those resolved too. So, I'd heard about the effects of grains in general on the body too, but was resisting making that change in our diet. It's hard enough feeding a large family and avoiding wheat, but to entirely eliminate grains was going too far. This book is pushing me over the edge.<br /><br />Dr. Pearlmutter has laid out the facts, research, and documentation to show how detrimental grains and sugar are to our brains. Dementia is getting to be such a huge problem for the elderly and even younger people now that it really worries me that I'll have that problem in the future. From this book I now know how to do my best to avoid that burden on my family.<br /><br />I haven't finished this book yet, but I'm past my deadline for a review for Amazon Vine. I'm reading very slowly and highlighting SO much. When I do finish it, I'll came back and report on a few of my favorite parts and the 30 day plan.<br /><br />I've already recommended this book to several people and think everyone should know the truth about what research has really shown - even if it goes against what the drug companies, lobbyists, and government want us to believe.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|even the kindle version is amazing. reading on galaxy and no problems. Great books, long, each chapter a fantastic suprise.
B000I3SYEI|5.0|One of the best Star Trek movies with the classic cast. Always enjoy watching this film. Great Action and special effects for an 80's film.
B0016OOS16|4.0|I won't go into too much detail about the product in general, as I think others have covered it pretty well. As a summary:<br /><br />* Physically very well made and visually impressive, as with their other products<br />* Too light, tends not to stay put<br />* Where cord comes out is not well designed for a portable device, should be detachable or better strain-relieved<br />* Fuzzy case lining adds to the lint problem on the base<br /><br />In my case, I've found a strategy that helps with the problem of staying put. Every time I pull the thing out to use it, I grab a paper towel, wet one corner, and use that wet corner to first wipe the base, and then the spot on the table where I'm going to put it. I then use the dry remainder of the towel to dry the device and the table. I then grasp the base and firmly press down on it, making solid contact with the table surface.<br /><br />What's interesting is that the rubber they chose for the base is very soft and actually slightly sticky when it's clean and grips *really* well in this condition. After doing this little maneuver, I have never had to deal with the device moving around. It's essentially an almost perfect fix. It's a bit of a hassle, but I've gotten used to it.<br /><br />All in all I'm glad I finally bought this; hauling my old full-size SpacePilot around was a drag and I'm glad to have this little one to use with my laptop. I'm disappointed that the cord isn't any more appropriate for a portable tool than the one on the SpacePilot, but so far it hasn't failed yet. I try to be careful with it as I'm packing and unpacking.
B009A9EPLM|5.0|John Williams is perfectly comfortable with Americana, having turned in everything from the Patriot to JFK. The tone here is spot on, carrying great depth of feeling with orchestration that could have been over the top, but is instead perfectly restrained and intimate at the right moments.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  Real world advice from a guy you can't help but admire.  I know I can use what he says.<br /><br />Signed,<br /><br />Future millionaire
B00FVFT7YO|5.0|Spoiler Alert:  There are minimal excerpts from the book in this review that are included to reinforce my points.<br /><br />The tagline for this book is &#34;Improve the Quality of Your Life by Reprogramming Your Subconscious Mind.&#34;  This sets both positive expectations and a clear tone for the text.  I like how the author follows the format of other books in his self-help series by with a brief explanation of why he wrote the book and why you should read the book.  This serves as an excellent segue into the first chapter, &#34;What are Positive Affirmations?&#34;  The answer is in the first sentence, &#34;powerful tools that actualize your desires in life.&#34;  And thus, this book provides guidelines for actual physical processes that help move your desires towards reality.<br /><br />As with similar books by this author, the verbiage is direct and conversational, almost as if you were in a consulting session with the author.  The advice is straightforward, yet thorough and the author provides links to online tools to help continue the changes to your lifestyle and thinking process that are initiated from reading the book.<br /><br />I liked how the third chapter introduced a concrete process and successive chapters provide examples of creating positive affirmations for situations ranging from confidence and self-esteem to relationships and prosperity.
B00DQVSTCG|1.0|I still have not opened my copy of the Blu-Ray DVD. And ever since I heard about the recall, I can't return it.  Anyone hear about if and when the recall will take place?  Pretty disappointed after hearing the news.  Something tells me that nothing will take place, be forgotten about, and have this be a total waste of money.  Not a fan of Interscope Records for not taking action. Making excuses and other ways of possibly viewing a better quality of it does not satisfy anybody after the anticipation and money spent in support of Madonna... NOT Interscope Records.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game. minions are so funny.it I the best and exciting g game I have played all year.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I am a mystery reader who enjoys all of Lee Child's books.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys mystery and excitement.
B007G92QGO|4.0|&#34;Defending Jacob &#34; drew me in from the very first page.  The characters were real and believable and the dialogue was authentic.  Although I thought I knew how it would turn out I was wrong.  This is the first book by William Landay that I have read.  I will now look up the others.
B001NHNG64|5.0|I had not read this (his early book) before, but have read most others.  I like his writing style and the excitement he brings in his writings.
B0036S4B6M|2.0|My daughter was reading this book, so I purchased based on her recommendation. I do not recommend this book unless you are extremely bored. The characters were not particularly interesting and it reads like a very inexperienced writer put together a quick manuscript to send in to a publisher, but it really needs to be edited for continuity, and a couple of chapters could stand a little more detail.  Just my opinion... and would not have even bothered to review it, but it took me to this page as I finished it.
B00APN48QY|5.0|I loved this movie, and the fact that it's based on a real event makes it evern<br />more appealing. Thank you again
B00BTHWFBK|1.0|While I love the music Black Sabbath have written, and have absolutely no qualms with the music itself, the packaging this CD was in is just absolutely deplorable. The front of the deluxe edition is half coming off, the moment I got it out of the box. Both of the CD jewel holders weren't glued down properly, both came off as soon as I opened it up. The booklet doesn't fit in the sleeve properly, and the entire thing won't shut right, either. The CDs were also swapped in the holders. Both CDs play just fine, which is a surprise considering almost everything else about this just sucks.<br /><br />This is literally the worst packaging I've ever seen in a CD, especially a deluxe edition one. Amazon won't let me get a replacement, either. I'm not seeking a refund, as the music is incredibly enjoyable, but I just want a different packaging that doesn't have the quality control of someone with less than a fifth-grade education. I'm incredibly disappointed that this has happened to this CD.<br /><br />This came from Star Deals, and it's safe to say I'm not going to purchase anything from them EVER again if this is the kind of quality this retailer has.
B008NW67E0|4.0|I'm a huge fan of Mumford & Sons, so this CD was greatly appreciated. It was a great buy! Thanks!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This ap freezes up my web on my kindle, it wont fully load and it wont let me go to a different web page or anything while its just stuck pretending to load. Sometimes I get a post or two, but no pictures will load. Facebook is so popular, you would think you could get an ap that works....
B00CM03H4C|4.0|It was mailed to me promptly and in great condition! Everything was as promised, and I love the music! Thanks!
B009LDD4V4|5.0|love Bones but not always home to watch it. Love to be able to watch it on my own schedule
B00D3LA71K|4.0|If you liked the celebrated coming-of-age movie \\"Stand By Me\\"...you'll like this one. It is the same kind of story that shows a maturing of a pair of pre-teens mixed up in a dramatic situation.
B0084TWN9K|4.0|Each story is about daily life in Canada. 's Munro is sharing her special outlook on life that brings back memories of my own life. So glad she won the Nobel Prize so I could discover her writings. Will read other selections for sure. Her stories remind me of Anne Tyler's writing style and subject matter.
B001383XT8|3.0|I bought this pedal as a first distortion pedal. it was great for the first few weeks, nice tones. When i bought it, there were two in the amazon box, so i got one free, tested both of them. After a few weeks, the distortion itself broke. both of them became really fuzzy and thick, not like the tones i had before. Basically, i only use this pedal as a fuzz pedal with the Metal setting on my Line 6 Spider IV 15 watt amp.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|A friend suggested this and I have really enjoyed it. You are immersed into the lives of these people from the very beginning and really start to care about their lives. I recommend it.
B001IMR7RS|5.0|Best record by machine head! Hands down the best solos, drumming and music to date.. This record will blow you away. ! MACHINE HEAD!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I SO LOVE THIS GAME CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEW UPDATE ON OCTOBER 30, THERE IS GOING A LOT OF NEW STUFF IN THIS UPDATE AND THE NEXT UPDATE AFTER THIS ONE.
B00FPGSPQU|2.0|Big let down. No where near as funny as the past two, and it's even worse than the second. What a shame.
B00BT70J7M|5.0|Beautiful from the first note to the last.  Mr Kaufman never disappoints and this CD is no exception.  The meticulousness of the liner notes is also wonderful.
B001MM28JG|5.0|I NEVER get tired of watching this.  perfect cast, very funny.  me and my friends quote this movie all the time.
B0086700CM|4.0|There is nothing spectacular, just a fun way to kill some time.  Well done and the graphics are well done.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Had my doubts, but Playrix did it again! Still am a hard core Fishdom fan, but this is pretty awesome too. Easy to learn, and still challenging. NEED more of the Fishdom series for android and Microsoft for my phone though, please.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|This is not Dave Eggers best writing, but I recommend it to anyone who uses the internet, which is pretty much everyone. A timely tale about the dangers of information and the internet run amok. It should be a warning to everyone about how information can(and will) be used against you. Whether it's the NSA or big corporations, everyone wants to know all about you. And like sheeples, we keep logging on, posting, tweeting, shopping and sharing, and all that information is collected....... for what purpose? To close the circle?
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|My title explains it all. This game is so much fun but takes forever to load. Sorry to be a bummer but honestly I am being serious
B00C7TAF3Y|2.0|It is really difficult to figure out,not much is given on the help sign. I love a good puzzle right now glad it was only 1.99
B003QTWR08|5.0|These robots have more human spirit than most humans in most other movies.  One of the best and most surprising movies I've seen.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|For those who like a quirky sci-fi show combined with mystery, plot twists and turns and good acting then FRINGE is the show for you. I missed the first few seasons on cable and started watching halfway through the series run. It's been a 'good watch' to see the 1st season and catch up on what I missed. During the long, cold winter months, I intended to watch all the seasons I missed and even re-watch the episodes I previously saw. This is definitely a fun, thought provoking and addictive series. WATCH AND ENJOY !!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I really likewise this app its really handy. its basic and does what's supposed to do. this was one of the first apps I reinstalled when I set my kindle back to factory settings.
B00FKE3H0G|4.0|Catchy lyrics and beats make this album irresistible. Embarrassed to tell the world I love thus album after all Miley's escapades. I have to hand it to her. She delivered and the some.
B000PXUA5W|5.0|This was a gift for a young player and he was delighted with the watch.  He tells me he wears every day.
B00F5F9WF4|2.0|Expected more from this always promising artist. Usually Drake incorporates more R&B into his albums, but this was full of mostly rap. I enjoy both but hoped for more of the former.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I kept trying to stop thinking about the book so I could work and sleep, but you true fans know how impossible that is.  As always I was with the characters and felt the pain and the joy along this journey.
B005FMZWD8|4.0|Great watch.Really stands out.<br />A bigger face, but not too big. Very happy to add this to my collection.<br />Highly recommended to any collector.
0062255657|2.0|I had high hopes for this book, and even though I read it all, I was very disappointed after I finished reading it.  I wish I could get my money back.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|that's the item I was looking for, great staff. I like it very much,the item is as described from the seller.No issues what so ever. torres
B00DOPEGAS|2.0|I bought this thinking it would have sparkly rubber bands- however this has no shimmer or sparkle in the entire set. No beads, nothing extra. Stick with the generic (and much easier to use!) product and save yourself the extra 5 dollars. Complete waste of money.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Just a very good read all the way through, with several thought-provoking parts.  I will highly recommend it to every one of my reader girlfriends!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Works as advertised, and I've used it to stream content from my computer.  With most TVs being 'smart TVs', this product may not be for everyone.  I've hooked it up to an older HDTV set and it looks a lot better than the standalone media player box, plus it doesn't need a separate plug to add to the clutter (as long as there's an available USB port nearby).  I gave it 4 stars since the design means one should think about where the HDMI port is on the TV.  If you only have a side HDMI port available the product will be visible sticking out from the side (not the cleanest of looks).  If your HDMI ports in the back are oriented that it would plug in horizontally instead of vertically, you would need to make sure there's enough clearance for the chromecast to reside (may be an issue for those mounting their TV on the wall).  Additionally, the fact you need a USB port to power it is another consideration since older TVs may lack one.  I hope the functionality continues to expand on this unit, as I've seen (and bought into) a lot of products that work great off the bat, but fizzle once support wanes.
B005C0DHEY|3.0|It was a thought provoking documentary. I learned more than I knew about fracking. I will look at the EPA with a more skeptical eye. Looking forwrd to the sequel.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Timeless classic that has provided enough hours of entertainment while waiting around (such as at the DMV, pediatrician appointments, waiting for a table at a restaurant, etc.).
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I stumbled across this book while looking for something for my husband and I to listen to in the car (that was essentially kid-friendly for my way too bright three year old), that neither of us were at different places in. We've got a couple of series we're both reading but were in different places in them. We had a ten-hour drive ahead of us, so we wanted something that was about twenty hours. And I stumbled across The Name of the Wind.<br /><br />The reviews for the quality of the audiobook itself were excellent--the narration was fantastic. I also have to admit being swayed by a quote from Game of Thrones author, George R. R. Martin: \\"he's bloody good, this Rothfuss guy.\\"<br /><br />Okay, so the audiobook is twenty-seven hours, not twenty. Still, I agree with Martin's assessment. The worldbuilding in this book is phenomenal. I just adored it. The setting, the magical system, the width and breadth of the cultures--everything feels so real. There's history, things lost, things forgotten, the world feels complete. I want to know more. I'm currently beating down my own tendency towards spoilers. This is a rare occasion in which I just want to read.<br /><br />It's a different take--the infamous hero's tale from his own mouth. And Kvothe as a narrator is charismatic, magnetic, incredibly compelling. There's humor, tragedy, a real sense of the fragility of life and the emotions associated with loss and poverty. It's also great fun to hear the true stories of what come to be infamous tales.<br /><br />Not only is the world a masterclass example of worldbuilding, and the narration fantastic, the character building is done with equal skill. Characters long dead you feel like you could know, they're just that well built. I think the synopsis covers the greater part of Kvothe's life, whereas The Name of the Wind really covers from ages 8 to 16-ish, childhood to the cusp of adulthood, when he begins to gain infamy. This allows school-age antics with a group of close friendsto provide some levity in what can otherwise be a dramatic and tragic story.<br /><br />And on top of all of that is the prose--the language. This is literature. The prose can bounce from playful to heart-wrenching, from satire and sarcasm to statements that seem like profound truths.<br /><br />  \\"Remember this son, if you forget everything else: A poet is a musician who can't sing. Words have to find a man's mind before they can touch his heart. And, some men's minds are woeful small targets. Music touches their hearts directly, no matter how small or stubborn the mind of the man who listens.\\"<br /><br />There is a care and a craft to the storytelling as a whole that is deeper than anything I've read in a good long time. And, it's something I strongly feel will last the test of time. As much as I enjoy contemporary fiction--even contemporary paranormal, I think a lot of fantasy has a longevity much greater because it doesn't involve modern element which can be so quickly outdated. The Name of the Wind, I feel, could definitely become a piece of classic fantasy literature.<br /><br />So, go read it. It's awesome. I've got some other books on my plate before I can read the second and the third will hopefully be sometime in 2014. I can't wait.<br /><br />Also, given the time period that most of this book covers, it almost counts as YA and it's pretty clean in terms of language and sex.<br /><br />  \\"Words are pale shadows of forgotten names. As names have power, words have power. Words can light fires in the minds of men. Words can wring tears from the hardest hearts. There are seven words that will make a woman love you. There are ten words that will break a strong man's will. But a word is nothing but a painting of a fire. A name is the fire itself.\\"

B00FJU1HLC|5.0|Saw previews for this when it was out in theaters. Didn't want to see it then. Saw it was available on here and decided to give it a chance. We laughed through the movie. It was interesting to see how people think cavemen were. Great story line!

B0055V6EZE|5.0|Beyond my expectations.......the man, the music and the story of his love of lyrics is unique.  Sit back and prepare to be amazed.
B00632HWOG|2.0|NEW VERSION TERRIBLE.<br />Yahoo uploaded a new version of Yahoo Mail that I didn't ask for.  NO SAFE DRAFT BUTTON.  Since Yahoo crashes frequently, all of your work is lost.  The send buttom as well as the text buttons are at the bottom.  In addition, Yahoo tries to force you into using their Cloud storage.  IF I HAD WANTED IT I WOULD HAVE SIGNED UP.  BRING BACK THE OLD YAHOO...OR YOU WILL BE LOOSING CUSTOMERS.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I've had it for s bit. Seems to work well and easier to use and figure out. I'm about to set the alarm. Would recommend. :)
B003B02O0A|5.0|A fast paced thriller....a great book and I was surprized it was Grisham's first book.  The hardship and backwardness of Mississippi makes John a great writer.  Jim Miller.  Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. 17 October 2013.

1451695195|5.0|A very thought-provocing book.  I passed it on to couple of people and will put it in our church library when it is returned.  Two others have read it because of my recommendation.<br /><br />It does get a little detailed and those without a medical background may get bogged down.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It does what I need it to do without any extra clutter. Worked on the first try (some apps don't).
B00DAXYNEI|5.0|When I saw that Netflix was remaking House of Cards, the brilliant Ian Richardson series made decades ago in the UK, my first reaction, as always in this situation, was &#34;Is this really necessary?  How can you improve on the original?  Is the US entertainment industry really so bereft of ideas ..... etc. etc.&#34;  Well, I was wrong, this series is awesome.  Kevin Spacey is at least Ian Richardson's equal, and in some ways superior, in that for example I think he is actually better at pulling off that signature &#34;addressing the audience&#34; gimmick that was so hard to get used to in the original.  The cast is great.  The scenes involving political discussions, for example in the President's office, seem genuine and not overdone, as if one were a fly on the wall.  The best part of the series, and the best rationale for the Americanization of this series, is the American political context.  Not only are the institutions of government and their interrelationships immediately recognizable, but there are echos of real life political situations from US history that make this even more fun - and at times disturbing - to watch.  One contemporary example is the (PA governor) Corbett administration carrying out the bidding of the fracking industry here in PA by championing a law to prevent local municipalities from regulating drilling within their districts.  In the TV series, this is part of the political machinations of a candidate being promoted (well, sort of) by the Spacey character.  The show ends with many loose ends, but, hooray, season 2 is now being put to bed and should be available in February.  This sceptic can't wait.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|It is a movie that i really enjoyed and shared with my family.  Would highly recommend to all my friends.
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|I got the game on a free app deal and love it so much , it has become my go to game.  I'm always finding new stuff.  I have several games I paid full price for that weren't as fun as this one.  I'd have paid full price and then some if I hadn't lucked into this game!!
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|Maxwell is like a Greek philosopher. You have to understand his way of thinking. Take what you need and leave what you don't need.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have to go buy the next book in the series.  Great.  Everything is great.  The writing, the characters, the world of silo' s.  All sci fi fans need to discover Hugh Howey .
0307949508|5.0|I just finished The Girl who kicked the hornets nest and can't wait to get started on this one.  The last was absolutely wonderful.
B00FPH51LQ|5.0|This was a lot of fun. Jeff Bridges and Ryan Reynolds have very cool chemistry in this fun flick. Jeff Bridges is hilarious, and so is Reynolds. I'm giving it five stars because it's the movie Ghost, MIB, and Ghost Busters all wrapped up into one. Great marriage of plots, and ideas. Not meant to be an Oscar winner, just fun and entertaining, and it was just that...Great Fun!!!
0307949486|5.0|This was my introduction to this author. Have ordered the other two in the series. Such good writing. Keeps you on the edge of your seat and not wanting to put it down.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|Fun CCG that costs you nothing to try out.  If you like CCGs you should get it.  You got nothing to lose but your free time.

B00DJFIMW6|2.0|I didn;t find this game interesting in the least...I guess this one should have a age limit for instance 2 - 5 year olds.
B00FPGSPQU|5.0|Hard to believe than can come up with something as funny each time but they do and they keep it different
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|Very addictive and very painful game. What happens to the guy when the truck turns over is just cruel, but if that can be avoided, highly enjoyable.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|We enjoyed catching up on what we had missed of this series. The DVD's were excellent quality with no problems for a US user.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|I tried installing it several times, and each time it failed or showed an error message. I am not sure what the problem is.
B0006B29WA|5.0|I've wanted to buy this album for a long time, and for a reason awesome bonus album. Truly it is great.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I am not a big fan of Science Fiction, but I'm trying to keep a more open mind. I tend to have a hard time wrapping my head around the fantasy aspect of these books and prefer more facts and realistic writing. In the last few years I have become a more avid reader, and I want to try other things to broaden my taste. When I saw that there is a movie coming out based on this book I became curious.<br /><br />My interest really peaked after seeing these. I had completely forgotten that I put my name on the reserve list at the library for this book when I got the email saying it was in. I had no idea what to think about this but gave it a shot. At first I wasn't a big fan. It started out with a conversation between two military men about a boy, no lead in or history, just a conversation. I actually thought my audio copy downloaded incorrectly.<br /><br />Then the story starts, and we meet Ender as he is about to get his monitor removed. As the book progresses we learn a little more about the purpose of the monitor, but at first I was so lost as to why it was important for his monitor to be removed and why it was so important to open the book. So if you start frustrated give it time. The beginning does finally give enough info to help you get going. Still, I do wish there was more back story to this book. Ender has some quirks about him that puzzle me, and I wishthere was a little more substance behind these, unless I missed something and that is possible. A re-read might be what I need later down the road.<br /><br />What I really liked about this was Ender's character, and I always liked following him to see what turmoil he would have to deal with next. The poor kid gets picked on and tormented, as well as moved around as soon as he makes a friend in Battle school. He is being isolated so he can't form attachments. Every situation was for a reason, Ender needed to be trained and tested so he could be put right into battle with the Buggers. Is he the answer to end the war?<br /><br />From each battle in school, to the challenges he faced as the military elite tested and pushed him, I was hooked. It may have had some slow parts and been a little confusing at first, but I really liked this book. I couldn't wait to see what happened next and how Ender was going to overcome it. I will be getting the next chapter in the Ender saga soon. I really liked how the end of this book set up the next one. It was done very well and allowed this story to wrap up and still leave it open and intriguing.<br /><br />One little piece before I end this. Orson Scott Card has a section on the end of the audio book that talks about the book and how it came to be. He said the only way we the reader could understand the horrible moral situations and torment was to be in Ender's head. I'm paraphrasing of course, but I think he is absolutely right. Had this book not been told from Ender's perspective I don't think there would have been the same emotion in the writing.<br /><br />After much thought and consideration I want to give this book 4.5 stars. I can't seem to get this book out of my head, but at the same time I don't feel it was as spectacular as others I've given five stars too. I really enjoyed this book and can't wait to see what happens next. I also can't wait to see how they do the movie and I'll hope that they do it justice.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Saw other friends play it, now I see what the buzz was all about! Just a all out amazing game!
1781162646|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I was so excited to hear about it because I am a big Stephen King fan, and I love the old pulp or noir style detective stories. This isn't a detective story, but it still has a very intriguing mystery. Here is the description from Goodreads:<br />&#34;I love crime, I love mysteries, and I love ghosts,&#34; says Stephen King, who has combined these elements into a wonderful new story. Joyland is a whodunit noir crime novel and a haunting ghost story set in the world of an amusement park.<br /><br />It tells the story of the summer in which college student Devin Jones comes to work as a 'carny' in small-town North Carolina and has to confront the legacy of a vicious murder, the fate of a dying child, and the way both will change his life forever. It is also a wonderful coming-of-age novel about friendship, loss, and your first heartbreak. Who dares enter the funhouse of fear?<br />There isn't a lot of fast paced action right from the get go, but from the very start I loved these characters. Following Devin Jones and his new friends Erin and Tom was the best part of the book for me. King has this way of writing characters that feel like flesh and blood people. These characters felt like I could step into the pages and instantly be friends with them. This is an amazing talent, and it made the fact that there wasn't a lot of heart pounding suspense right off the bat seem meaningless.<br /><br />Not only are the characters people you will enjoy reading about but the setting is just perfect for this. Carnivals can be these bright happy places where memories are made and still very creepy. With the story set around the tale of a murder that happens at Joyland, Devin begins to wonder if there really are ghosts haunting the grounds. Who is this killer that has eluded capture for so long? Devin begins to look into the events at Joyland and slowly the pieces come together with a little help from an extraordinary little boy.<br /><br />King's style isclearly evident here, and he really draws you into the story. One of the things that just irks me about King is the fact that he will let you know early on what's going to happen at the end, but then the way he writes and the realness of his characters makes you wish and hope it was all a ruse. I may get upset that I know about something that will happen at the end, but it is the journey to that point that makes it all worth it. I'm not sure this is making sense, but I don't know any other way to explain it.<br /><br />Even though this isn't a horror novel I still had goosebumps through most of the end. The way pieces are revealed and put together was wonderful. I couldn't put this book down. It is an easy read compared to most of King's work and one I will highly recommend to anyone who will listen. That is why I am happily giving this book a solid five star rating.

0439813786|4.0|I am a little late to the party with this one. I must be honest and say that I had not heard about this book until well after the movie had come out. I loved the trailer, and the idea of this mechanical man drawing a secret note once fixed seemed intriguing. I still haven't seen the movie yet, but it has been on my to watch list for along time.<br /><br />It wasn't until a year or two ago that I found out Hugo was based off of this book. I had to put this on my to-read list but it sadly rested at the bottom. There were a lot of other grown up reads I wanted to get to first. The last time we all went to the library as a family my lovely wife had the idea that we should just get The Invention of Hugo Cabret and read it as a family. My son is almost 4 and my wife and I have both read books to him individually but this was the first time we read as a family. I was very excited for this to be our first family read. My wife and I traded off nights that one of us would read while the other just listened.<br /><br />Don't let the page count fool you. There is actually very little to read. Most of the book is pictures drawn by Brain Selznick. The art work is pretty good, and it really does help move the story along. In some parts the story only moves forward by the pictures. My son really liked the pictures, and it was so hard for him to not spoil parts for me on the nights I wasn't home when they read it.<br /><br />Since I have talked about every other aspect of this book it is time I mention the story. The story was very engaging. Even as an adult I couldn't wait to see what happened next in Hugo's life. There were times I just wanted to read ahead after we put my son to bed just so I didn't have to wait. Poor Hugo has lost so much in his life. His father goes to work one night and a fire claims him. Then Hugo is forced to live with his drunk uncle in the train station who just disappears. Left alone in the train station apartment, Hugo is left to fix the clocks in the station and fend for himself so he isn't thrown into an orphanage. The only thing that keeps Hugo going is the automaton his father was working to fix.<br /><br />Hugo recovered the robot from the wreckage of the museum his father worked at and took it back with him to the train station. The mystery of what the automaton will write was a lot of fun. I do recommend this book to anyone looking for a good story. It is a very quick read and very entertaining. I give this four out of five stars. We all enjoyed this book and now I am anxious to read the other books by Selznick.

B005G4TJI4|2.0|Watch the trailers for Transformers: Dark of the Moon and tell me they don't send shivers up your spine.  Clearly there were some extraordinarily talented people working on the film. Unfortunately they all appeared to be in the special effects department and that's perhaps the saddest thing about the end result. This could have been a great film but the writing isn't just bad it's spectacularly bad. It's as if it were written by a twelve year old boy giggling in the back row of math class. Early in the movie Megan Fox's replacement, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, is standing at the White House when a woman walks over, looks down below Whiteley's beltline and says. `Nice Box'. The obvious joke being that the woman is literally commenting on a nice looking box and with that all the dignity of the film flies right out the window. (In the movies defense the dignity had already been stripped away long before that joke)<br /><br />So here I sit at my computer thumbing my nose at a movie that grossed over a billion dollars. This review will be lucky if it gets read by five people but this movie tasks me to write. It's like Michael Bay produced the movie just to screw with people. The film starts with the ever popular Shia LeBeouf and his new girlfriend. Oh, and a couple of horny gremlin looking little Autobots. Yeah, that's what I think about when I think Transformers. The focus of the movie is all on Shia LeBeouf's Sam Witwicky because fans just can never get enough LeBeouf. We see him trying to get a job. We see him working at his new job. We see him interacting with his idiotic, unfunny parents. Pure comedy gold every second.  There are all sorts of other characters that are written as if the writers were aliens whose only experience with humans was to watch them from a distant planet. Between all this filler and garbage is just about the most awesome fighting robot action ever put on film.<br /><br />The special effects action are why the film grossed over a billion dollars but the writing is why the film will never stand the test of time because special effects become dated very quickly. The special effects in the 1977 Superman movie were junk compared to the 2013 movie but it still holds up because of the writing. Movies like Robocop, Bladerunner and Predator stand the test of time because the scripts were great or at the very least not terrible.  You could probably get full enjoyment out of Dark of the Moon just watching the good parts on YouTube. I've seen the scene from Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen where Devastator transforms and then climbs to the top of a pyramid and it looks INCREDIBLE but I don't really need to see the movie because I've seen the cool parts and I've heard it's even worse than this one.  The special effects here aren't uniformly good and scenes where Shia LeBeouf is fully CGI are pretty bad. The scene from the trailer where a giant Decepticon is crushing a building is cool but what you don't see are the parts where the people inside slide around in the collapsing building like something out of a cartoon.<br /><br />This is not even nearly the worst movie I have ever seen but to spend so much money and create such amazing visuals and then create such pitiful writing. Apparently people don't care because the movie raked in money like Scrooge McDuck filling his money bin. I was hoping to see something similar to the aforementioned Devastator scene but the big robot in this film is actually Shockwave who seems to control this giant tentacle looking robot and it just didn't compare to Devastator. There is some cool stuff but with almost no focus on character building as pertains to the Transformers themselves they tend to just look like nearly indistinguishable piles of junk when in robot form bashing into each other. I also wasn't real thrilled with the attempt to tie into actual historical events like the moon landing and the Chernobyl disaster seemed ill advised bordering on offensive. When THE Buzz Aldrin shows up to say that, yeah, they went to the moon to investigate a crashed alien spacecraft it felt like abuse of the elderly. I didn't hate this movie but I wouldn't ever pay to see it nor do I have any interest in owning it. All the good stuff is on YouTube and you can watch it in about 10 minutes.in shows up to say that, yeah, they went to the moon to investigate a crashed alien spacecraft it felt like abuse of the elderly.

The actors are perfect for those personalities they portray and Sherlock is remarkably well written, well devised and incredibly well developed.

0805047905|5.0|This board book is entertaining enough, yet short enough that my son loves to read it. He loves the cadence and he's learned when to turn the next page and does so at 7 months of age. Board books are great for babies for that reason. Paper pages just don't hold up if they want to participate in turning pages.  It is also entertaining to hear how many different ways the book can be read depending on who is doing the reading... everyone has their own style.

B005LAIIGM|4.0|I definitely see how this movie is such a smash hit.  Sandra Bullock and George Clooney together, and often Bullock alone, face crisis after crisis after debris smashes into their space shuttle.  Thus begins an exciting thriller set in space.  Bullock's attempt to get back to earth is much more complicated and tense than I would have expected.  There were many moments where the visual look of space engrossed me in the experience.<br /><br />The movie relies heavily on sound vs. silence, on an almost first-person perspective of the crisis, and on a &quot;real time&quot; pace.  Real time means the story flows in the same timespan as it's depicted as; there's no skipping over time in the edits/cuts.  I think real time is used in Gravity to the same effectiveness as the great western suspense thriller High Noon.  The script is very economical, combining practical discussion of emergency measures with Bullock talking with Clooney about her personal background.  There's even a little humor, part of which is from Clooney having a WWII kind of joking/understated style of stating the problem (&quot;This isn't going to be a joy ride&quot; is the kind of thing his character says when there's a big issue).<br /><br />On a thematic level, Clooney's character helps her move forward in life instead of hiding from it, which is really what grounds the movie.  You really want her to survive and live her life with less melancholy once she gets back to earth, and there is great satisfaction when she finally does get home to earth and is so glad to get to shore.  The visual contrast from loneliness and blackness to the colors of earth is a quite satisfying resolution, as is the visible relief on her face at the end.  Sandra Bullock is an actress you can look at for solid minutes, and she remains easy to watch and doesn't seem like she's acting, even when she is sad or scared for a lot of the movie.  She is quite a natural actress.<br /><br />I felt that the only thing missing from the movie was more development of/transformation in her view of God.  She talked about wanting God's help but not knowing how to pray, and said &quot;thank you&quot; (presumably to God) when she was finally safe, but there wasn't any further development.<br /><br />It's a very unique movie in its construction, especially how it creates suspense with letting you hear the silence and the breathing and mechanical and electric noises, with music rarely getting much in the way.  It also grounds the whole story in a symbolic contrast between outer space's loneliness and earth's vivacity, which symbolizes Bullock's struggle to move on and embrace life instead of closing herself off from pain.  The mostly practical relationship between Bullock and Clooney very economically addresses, in the midst of various crises, her own personal struggle to move on and embrace life, which is what the movie ultimately is about.  For these reasons, I recommend seeing it.

Ever since leaving the Air Force I have been speaking around the world about peace and if I hadn't been I would certainly start now. Humanity cannot afford nuclear weapons. Unfortunately, as Eric says in his excellent book, they cannot be uninvented. I recommend this book. Eric's research and attention to detail are impeccable. His story telling kept me turning the pages the whole way through. Thank you, Eric.

B00B4804KS|5.0|Classic Movie with plot, script, acting that will stand the test of time.  Spielberg's cinematography was 3-dimensional, long before 3D technology was available. Among the Best 3D Post Conversions so far. (I did find that the base HD image seemed a bit softer with less contrast than my old DVD release - highly recommend adjusting Contrast and Brightness accordingly!) I haven't seen this movie in ages, so watching it in 3D with the re-worked, more expansive DTS soundtrack was very immersive. I have a modest active 3D projector with an older 6.1 surround setup with two subwoofers and a Buttkicker system. Watching it on the home big screen really added to the scale of the 3D, and the subwoofers and Buttkicker really added to the T-Rex scenes.  FYI, d-Box effects are included on the BR-3D - that should be lots of fun! (I'm working up to owning that.)  Mr. Spielberg, Excellent Job Again! Amazon, thanks for a great discounted price for pre-order.

B008EL25LE|3.0|While described by many as a \\"match three game\\", this game (in both versions) is far more than that. You draw trails among at least three pieces to remove them from the board (and rearrange the board). The more you remove at one time, the better.<br /><br />There are many twists such as locked spaces, frozen spaces, etc. Essentially to unlock the space you either have to remove a piece adjacent to it or remove a piece on that space twice. You are assisted by lightning strikes as you build up charge from releasing longer chains of pieces, wildcards, and other devices.<br /><br />Compared to the first version of the game, I think the pieces in this version are a bit small, which may have contributed to problem number two. I much preferred the larger spaces and portrait orientation of the first version.<br /><br />Second, in later screens the game is often bugged. Spaces which have no blocks sometimes will just not path as they should. Since each screen is timed, this wastes valuable time as you try to path through a space that just won't work. It's not a problem with screen sensitivity ... after the pieces rearrange from a different move sometimes that space will become pathable again. This is definitely a bug and a very frustrating one.<br /><br />Third, sometimes the game decides you are done with pathing through spaces before you are actually done pathing through spaces. I did not encounter this issue with the first edition of the game, and again it may have to do with it's detection along smaller spaces. So occasionally what should have been a seven space chain would sadly be detected as a five space move by the game, leaving an unusable two space combo left over.<br /><br />Outside of these issues, the art in the game is top notch, and the game itself is different and interesting. There is a LOT of luck involved, as some screens just cannot be solved unless you get some favorable drops, but that is true of all of this general sort of game.<br /><br />This game is fun for a while, but I eventually abandoned it as I encountered the dead space bug more and more often.<br /><br />I played this with a Kindle FIRE HD 8.9 and experienced the above described bugs.fun for a while, but I eventually abandoned it as I encountered the dead space bug more and more often.<br /><br />I played this with a Kindle FIRE HD 8.9 and experienced the above described bugs.

There was an over emphasis on \\"a storm is coming\\" both figuratively and literally speaking.  But, the last 15 minutes of the finale episode was just a slap in the face to the fans, horribly inaccurate and implausible ending.  It was like the writers said \\"oh crap, we forgot this was the end... lets just throw something together\\" and the spent 10 minutes writing it.  I'll still buy the final season, but, like many other fans... found the final episode insulting and a major let down.

B00DW1WR14|5.0|My short and direct review.  This album has a very nice mix of energetic tunes in Swallowed Whole and Mind Your Manners intertwined with slower, personal near-instant classics like Sirens and Future Days.  Pendulum's haunting, deliberate beat with Eddie's emotions traveling from side to side paints a vivid moving mental picture of indecisiveness.<br /><br />One full listen and I'm sold.

As a paid game I would not recommend.

B008EL25LE|4.0|Less than two weeks after the original [[ASIN:B009PMEEY2 Azkend]] (which I also reviewed) was the Free App of the Day, its sequel takes the top slot. In gameplay terms, little has changed: you still select existing matches of three or more to progress. The story mode includes both \\"classic\\" gameplay from the first Azkend, where making matches turns those tiles blue and you have to change the whole grid to that color, and a new \\"fog\\" version where you have to dispel fog from certain tiles by making matches on adjacent tiles. In both modes, once you've completed the initial task, a special item is dropped in at the top of the grid, and you have to make matches below it to drop it to the bottom and finish the level. Also returning from the original Azkend is the thunder meter, which fills up a little every time you make a match that progresses gameplay (turns at least one tile blue or dispels a little fog). When it's full, it'll turn a few more tiles blue or dispel fog, depending on the mode. Making matches of six or more will also clear extra tiles. As you progress, you unlock power-ups that, when included in matches, make things easier for you in various ways.<br /><br />So most of the gameplay is the same. What's different? The big thing is that the visuals and sound are much improved. The original Azkend got a lot of praise for its graphics, but I found them adequate at best. This one is much sharper, pretty gorgeous even on an HD screen. And there's nice music, plus some voice acting in the story mode, which makes it feel more substantial even though it's just the usual few sentences of text. The difficulty is also a bit higher, which is welcome as I found the original Azkend too easy. The only problem is that the increase in difficulty comes mostly from tighter time limits on the levels, which makes it easier to get stuck if the random tile drops leave you with a bunch of singles in key spots. At that point, you either have to make a lot of fast matches or restart the level. I'd rather a difficulty boost from good design rather than punishing time limits, but it's still an improvement. Bonus levels are also tougher, but more appropriately so: these match-the-spot-in-the-viewfinder challenges now punish you for making the wrong selection, so getting 100% is tricky.<br /><br />There's a list of achievements to be completed, plus two challenge modes: a pure race against the clock and new \\"medal\\" versions of each story mode level. Overall it's a great match-three package, one I'd recommend to everybody... while it's free. But the regular price is a steep $4.99 (compared to $2.99 for the original), and while the graphics and music are definitely impressive, I'm not sure the gameplay is improved enough to be worth a premium app price. If you really liked the original or love match-three games in general, I'd say go ahead and pay for it, but otherwise, be more cautious in laying out your money.t the level.

B00EKHE1JA|2.0|I was so excited about this figure, Ive never had any experience with neca and what they produce but my first impressions were just so bad. Mediocre work for a $37.00 dollar figure! I have been collecting figures for sometime now from revoltech, to other companies and i just hate these low grade figures... Waste of money in my opinion. I just really hate writing this review because I was in love with the film and in love with these beautiful robots. Its a shame that such an awful company like neca got their hands on making these figures instead of a company like square enix or revoltech... All in all, really regret this purchase. Please avoid neca and save yourself the time and the money.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is awesome. I like it a lot. I am 6 and the minions. are funny<br />I wish you did not have to pay real money for points. But I get a lot of bananas!
B008602KQI|4.0|I know this has been out for a couple years and after reading all 3 books ( a long time ago) I finally took the time to watch the movie.  I really enjoyed it, but of course nothing can go in depth like a book.  I will watch the next one when if comes out too.
B00328G4Y8|5.0|awesome cd  by the best guitarist ever. no bad tracks on this cd. just filling up space now for review
B00F91RYL8|3.0|The story has so much more potential then was realized in the film. I didn't buy Pitt's family, nor his dedication to them. Also, the drama around them led to nothing. I applaud the film for not being the next superhero action movie, but it could have been so much more.
B000002UVX|5.0|this cd rocks. from message of love to machine gun, there is just amazing guitar work by the legend himself
0739352989|5.0|Loved it it was the first time I every order a book like to hear would do it again<br />the book was great
B0009P5YXO|3.0|Very toy like.  All plastic.  LED very weak.  Have to manually swap pen nibs (not selectable).  A novelty item, a bit overpriced.
B00F35B8F8|5.0|Great movie. For Trekkies and non Trekkies. Can't wait for Abrams to do another Trek. And his version of Star Wars.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|Story line is weak, but lots of action to keep things going.  Worth watching.  Inside joke about red-shirts.  Start of Khan.
B003B02O0A|4.0|This book held my interest from beginning to end. I would highly recommend it!<br />It is completely worth the money.
1416583432|5.0|Wonderful Insight, you will look at your dog differently. Sometimes the science part goes a little over my head, but it's written with a sense of humor to balance things out. Love it. About 1/2 through it and it's hard to put down but I am reading it in small chunks so I can digest it and notice how my two dogs fit into the equation.
B0031RS2HC|4.0|Before I had my Kindle Reader I bought all the Reacher novels in paperback. I love 'em all [I don't give 5 stars to authors other than Chaucer and Shakespeare] so 4 stars for me means that it's up there with the best. I must have liked it because I am now in the process of purchasing all the Reacher novels for my Kindle.<br /><br />There was some criticism relating to Child's reliance on coincidence; but every author from before Dante to the present day has relied on this-so I would ignore that criticism.<br /><br />I have 3 criticisms of Child.<br /><br />The first is, count how many times in his novels does his hero 'say nothing' [hence the heading to this critique].<br /><br />Secondly, the editor or whoever, on this novel, should have corrected the references to 'mobile phones'. Citizens of the US call these 'cell phones'. I have even come across the expression 'portable phones' in a US context but the expression 'mobile' is only in UK use.<br /><br />Lastly; Child should never have agreed to the casting of the Cruiser as Jack Reacher. Was he having a laugh? Even an ageing Bruce Willis would have been more appropriate.<br /><br />Lee, I'll keep reading your excellent books but I ain't never going to watch that movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its a fun and adicting game and everyone always sends me challenges and tells me how high there score its fin toctry to beat you're score and when you're in a race there are little toobes that take you to a new place to race but you don't stop running you just keep going till you get hit and cant run any more
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Left wanting a lot more.  Left wondering what is going to happen with everyone. No conclusions. Need More Game of Thrones!
B00DWZHTOU|4.0|This movie was full of suspense, twists and surprises.<br /><br />The acting was top-notch. The directing and the flow were smooth. There's no moment of boredom.<br />It kept me on the edge of my seat from the beginning till the end. I could not figure out in advance what was going to happen next. I'm sorry I can't get into more details. Otherwise, I would ruin your enjoyment when you know things in advance.<br /><br />While watching it, I had a feeling the style of the action was not typical Hollywood's. After that, I found out the director was Louis Leterrier, a French. No wonder, his action style was different.<br /><br />Of course it had many logical holes. However, I was able to suppress my logic to enjoy it.<br /><br />According to boxofficemojo dot com, below were the financial figures of the film:<br />Production Budget: $75 million<br />Domestic:  $117,723,989<br />+ Foreign:  $215,300,000<br />= Worldwide:  $333,023,989<br />So, it made money both domestically and internationally. It took in 258 million dollars more than its production cost. That's more than 3 times its cost. What a return on investment!<br /><br />It's refreshing to watch a picture that is so different and more entertaining than most of the other movies of 2013. No wonder, it's the sleeper hit of 2013. Nobody could predict that.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I think this game is cool and entertaining and fun but I wish I didn't have to have Internet access to play it. But wheb the little people have the paw print things over their heads and they want me to do something... I just wish that the tasks could be performed in a simpler way.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game but the updats come so slow. My apple ipod has the update mo thes earyer than kindle dissapointing.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think that this app its amazing for kids that are just wanting to waste time Its very addictive. thank you
B00BMR4RIG|5.0|I use weather ex as my only weather app now. I like the phase of the moon on the front page. Easy to use.
B0099RFVXQ|3.0|Stupid means predictable; and everything about this film was predictable character eye candy with nifty CGI eye candy and much much more!
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I used Rosetta Stone for Portuguese for an entire school semester pretty much on a daily basis. I learned a bit, but almost none of it stuck. I have been using Duolingo for about a week and I can tell it's sticking. They teach me like I learned my other 2 languages. They repeat, but also make it difficult. When they speak, they speak at the speed a native speaker would speak. I really enjoy this app very much! It's been a huge help! Obrigado!!!
B00FN8HS5O|5.0|When I listened to the track 'Shenzou', I actually cried.  That doesn't happen very often.  This movie was so incredibly powerful and the soundtrack was a big contributor.  From the iconic horror of 'Debris' to the melancholy 'ISS', and finally the pure joyous victory of 'Gravity', you will remember each moment forever.  On the technical side, the album combines elements of electronic music and traditional symphony flawlessly.  I will be on the lookout for more work by Steven Price.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book would be interesting reading for any parent. It is a perfect example of &#34;unconditional love.&#34; I felt that the personalities of the characters were presented in a very believable manner.  Also, the book illustrated that &#34;understanding&#34; is within each individual. We tend to see things/people the way we want to see them.
0375507256|5.0|I first received this book as a gift from one of my best friends. Even though I was very grateful for the gift I didn't read it until a couple of months later. When I first started to read I felt like the first story (The Pacific Jopurnal of Adam Ewing)  was a slow and dull read and couldn't wait to get over with it so I could start the next one. When I got to the second story (Letters From Zedelghem) I started to connect the dots with the first story and at the end of the chapter, I couldn't wait to get to the next Adam Ewing story. With each story that adds up to the story line you start to connect more and more dot's until you get the full landscape at the end of the book. The language and dictionary used from the author is exceptional. I've never read something like it before and I really enjoyed reading this book. Each story was as individual but at the same time strongly connected to other stories. I really loved the whole concept of the book.<br /><br />I think this book was beautifully written. The whole karma and reincarnation thing was laid out perfectly. The author gave a story line which captivated the reader and asked for his whole attention in order not to miss a single detail.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this book to anyone no matter what kind of literature you like, you will love this book. It is not to be missed.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This is a great read for both WWII history buffs and non-history buffs.  The best part of course is the vivid description of the bombing run when the American pilot and the German pilot had their encounter in the skies over Germany.  The account is gripping and made me feel like I was actually in that plane with rest of the bomber crew!
B0094M2X6Y|5.0|too bad Disney won't finish the series, great visuals, good story, well told. E.R.B was a great author. loved it.
B00FEHXISA|1.0|Not on par with first two of series. Just trying to cash in with another sequel. Did not care for it.
B00F8LPH90|1.0|Maybe I missed something, I have been playing this game on my phone, and loved it. Problem is I can't play on the plane so I was ecstatic to hear it was available for the kindle fire. I bought it right away and I still have not seen it. I read somewhere today that it was incompatible.  Since Amazon won't answer the question,  I will throw this up to see what happens. Thanks
B00ACP3OOM|4.0|I enjoy swimming so I was really itching to give this a try. After receiving I immediately unpacked the device and popped it into my USB to charge up. It charged quickly with no issues. I then powered it on and connected it to my windows 8 PC.<br /><br />The way you load songs is straightforward - you open up the player using windows explorer and just drag songs onto the icon for the mp3 player. Transfer time is fast. Deleting is as simple as opening the \\"drive\\" and selecting the songs and deleting. You can also remove them from the device via an on-screen interface, but that requires deleting each song individually. Overall loading mp3s to the device isn't elegant but it works.<br /><br />After I loaded the songs I disconnected and turned the device on. It took a few seconds to load and a progress bar showed as it loaded and then I pressed play to start listening, where I ran into the first and only \\"problem\\" I've had with the device. The screen said the song was playing but no sound came out. I checked volume, etc. and paused, restarted, and still no sound. Somewhat perplexed I turned the device off and then on again and it started working. A little concerning but I've only observed this behavior once so I'm willing to write it off.<br /><br />As far as the device itself, the sound quality is excellent. It's not as good out of water, so depending on your swim style this might be a factor in your purchase, but it wasn't bad enough to bother me. The build quality is very nice - the device has a bit of a rubbery feel which makes it easy to grip when wet. It's also comfortable to wear. I have one complaint about the user interface. The left \\"earphone\\" has a button on them that lets you play / pause your music while swimming, however there is no button for next / previous track. This means either only load up songs that you want to hear on shuffle, or you have to create good playlists on the device which is a tedious process. For a more avid swimmer that too focused totake a second to skip a song they don't feel like hearing not a big issue, but I would have loved to see next/previous buttons on the right headphone.<br /><br />Overall an easy to use, no-frills device that delivers what it promises, with the added bonus of the looks / conversation starter when other people see you wearing it.
B005OP71GC|3.0|First off- Season 1 is the best Season out of the 3 by far.  But even so it has it's imperfections. Emily is a woman with beauty, A huge amount of money- it's not mentioned how much, but it seems to be in the 9 digits and a very loyal friend who is also the king of computer hacking.  Upon learning that her father was framed she decided to make it her life's work to avenge her father's imprisonment and death.<br /><br />Her father SUPPOSEDLY didn't want her to go down the path of revenge and yet upon his death he gifts her a box full of ways to go about it- including setting her up with a japanese revenge artist to train her in the art of vengence... uh...ya...<br /><br />The main problem I have with the show is it's soap opera campiness that sometimes takes over.  You get to see unbelievable things like a woman falling over 10 stories onto the roof of a car... who ends up not only surviving, but also with no scars or noticeable disability.  The writers seem to make up story lines that they don't always remember to finish either.  One of many examples: Little amanda was much younger and shorter when the FBI came to lock up her dad and seperate the two of them forever than she was in the scenes before that occured.  Obviously showing how the little actress was older and had grown by the time they decided to shoot those scenes in the latter half of the season.  It sometimes seems like the cast and production team puts more time and focus on how good everyone is dressed, how pretty they are and how everything looks than they do into the actual story-lines which is annoying.  Still the show manages to be entertaining.  It's fun to watch and if you are going to see a season it should be season 1.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|I absolutely love to see movies like this that defy the ability to guess what will happen next. Totally random but so very cool.
B00985E3UG|5.0|My husband basically got the audio version of this book because I couldn't help but read so many portions aloud. This book is a recommended read in my mind because it exposes the genius of the processed food industry. You may think you are impervious, but are you really? I discovered I'm not!
B0091WNK8M|5.0|I remember this movies when it came out and I saw it in the theater. Now my 13 year old makes me put it on for her. Some movies just transcend time and age difference to entertain everyone. Great movies for the family.

B009NX1YT6|5.0|How could you not love Grease? One of the coolest movies ever made. Even my 13 year old daughter loves this movie.

B00FPH6AXE|3.0|A father son tale which although is brilliantly shot an well edited ifalls victim to some poor writing and a surprisingly sub par performance by Will Smith.<br />I did like Jaden's performance.<br />If I wasn't a Sci-Fi fan it would have hotter 2 1/2 stars.
0545128285|3.0|This book was a gift for my niece. It is a beautiful cover and was well packaged. The book itself was disappointing. There were only a few stories, the rest was filled with waffle from the writer. All in all a big disappointment. I blame the writer, not the seller. They held up their end but the writer lost it on this one.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Great! I love the fact that I can read on my phone the books I love as well as browse Amazon for new ones.

B00E4A830G|5.0|I always enjoy Michael Connelly's novels and particularly Harry Bosch. one of the few novels I can't put down even at the age of 60

1593275080|5.0|'Fun, fun, fun!' is all I can think of as I flipped through this book! I got our 4.5 years old to sit with me as we flipped through each pages in the book, and oh wow... I'm so thrilled to see our boy getting more and more excited and anxious to see what's coming up in the next pages and boy oh boy, the pictures of the Lego creations included in this book are just gorgeous and droolworthy!<br /><br />Some of the Lego creations are totally awesome and got our boy so inspired and amazed! Pictures below are some of the Lego creations that got our boy's attention:<br />- Lego Ironman! Our boy is a big fan of Ironman and to see it made with Lego, oh wow... our boy was totally blown away!<br />- The castle from Alice in Wonderland story. Our boy has only watched Alice in Wonderland movie once so he does not really relate the castle to the story. He sees it as a castle and just wanted to build a castle!<br /><br />I also used the opportunity to educate our boy when we come across some of the Lego creations showcasing the olden days gadget like telephone, game console player and etc. Really nice to see all this in Lego creations!<br /><br />In summary, it  is so much fun to just flip through this amazing book and just be amazed (and drooled over them) on what other people have managed to achieved with tons of LEGO bricks! I hope this book is able to inspire our kiddos in creating more awesome designs using Lego bricks.
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|Its a fun game to play.. Its a big time killer if you need one. kids love it, I do.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|very entertaining :)<br />love the realistic options you can do but would be better if you could earn coins. faster.  but over all a good game for horse lover's who want to be around horses but cant
B00FPGSPQU|1.0|last thirty seconds were great. The rest felt like outtakes from the last two movies spliced together into hopefully humorous awkward moments.
B006GECE9Y|5.0|The Dolphin browser is an excellent alternative for web surfing on Android devices. First and foremost, Dolphin offers Flash support on devices that do not have native Flash support. Dolphin also support tabbed browsing (just like most desktop browsers), Sonar (voice-driven searching, navigation, and sharing), sync across devices and browsers (using extensions for Chrome and Firefox), and gesture browsing (similar to Swype, if you're familiar with its concepts - you can create your own shortcut gestures for frequently-used actions). A number of others bells and whistles are present as well. The program has so many features that are not available in any other browser that it is the only viable option for those features.<br /><br />At its core, the Dolphin browser is beautiful, rendering web sites much more gracefully than other Android-based browsers. And the speed of page rendering is stunning when you consider how beautifully it displays those pages. A highly recommended alternative for your Android devices.
B00CDV6WDS|3.0|The game shows possible moves and does not give the opportunity to turn it off.<br /><br />Other mahjong games are a greater challenge.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The movie is just dandy! Bought from a person, not direct- so it could have been old, but it's new! CPT
B006S01GH2|5.0|Cute  movie.  Complex story with lots of humor.  Cleverly done  and reminded me of  the same kind of character,  humor  and complexity of  the Ally McBeal TV  series.
B003EI2EH2|5.0|finally a book to get me off high center...my wife and I are both full steam ahead now.  great book.
B00BPDR3F6|3.0|I was excited to read this book especially based on all the wonderful reviews it had received. While I agree with many of the good things other reviewers wrote, I did not love this book. The opening sequence about Henry's rise to power and wealth was captivating and I was eagerly turning the pages. However, I was not a fan of all the exposition in the book. I understand that Alma had a brilliant mind, but I skipped page after page about her fascination with moss. It was tedious and boring to me. Alma's trip to Tahiti was not satisfying either especially her conversation with Tomorrow Morning. I don't want to go into too much detail so as not to spoil the plot for new readers. The character of Prudence was a puzzle. I would have loved to have a chapter or two in her POV. What was going through her mind? She was an enigma to Alma and frankly to me as well for the choices she made. The author has a beautiful writing style, but I would have liked to see less exposition and more dialogue and action instead.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Fabulous fabulous! I watch it over and over. Each frame is a piece of art. More, More, More please BBC.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Excellent book! Couldn't put it down. If you are at all curious about the operation which found and killed Bin Laden then read this firsthand account.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|It doesn't just look at the gory side of the zombie apocalypse, it also shows us the human side. What happens when good people do bad things? How do they survive? Will life ever go back to normal? This isn't a book on zombies. It is a book about people
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works great. Setup is a little cumbersome but once installed, it works perfect. Have seen a few online automatic updates since buying it on opening day. I like it so much I bought a second one to give as a gift.<br /><br />I bought with the expectation that it will become more versatile as more vendors take advantage of it and Google expands its capability.<br /><br />Before buying this my Netflix app was only on my Samsung Blu-Ray player which meant I could only watch Netflix material on the computer to which it is connected. Now I can move the Chromecast dongle to any HDMI capable TV and watch Netflix there.<br /><br />Thumbs up! Assuming Google enhances its firmware and versatility in the future.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Good story.  Great acting.  Nicely filmed.  Downton Abbey is a pearl.  We look forward to the next season!  Two words.
B0041QSZJM|5.0|This is a great album if you like their sound and compositions. I bought it for We Three Kings. Love their rendition. The rest of the album is done well too but I'm hooked on the WTK's selection.

B00DGGIXS6|5.0|I am so amazed when I look at Cher --of her age, youth, vim, vigor BEAUTY. She is looking BETTER than ever and though I still have my MANY FAVORITES of her classics that NOTHING could replace, which include her 70s CDs, ALL her Geffen CDs, Not.com, Allman and Woman, I'd Rather Believe in You, Heart of Stone era, I LOVE a few of these songs, despite not being fond of synth or vocodor-type computerized features. She SINGS her HEART out and even tho I never liked the song, I HOPE YOU FIND IT...I LOVE it when CHER sings it, partly cuz it is AMUSING how hard it is EVEN for a TRIED TIRED AND TRUE fan to FIND that Deluxe 17-Track Target edition (a Target \\"EXCLUSIVE\\" can you B E L I E V E some Target Stores NEVER GOT IT IN!!) so I always laugh at this song cuz I know it is about meaning in *life* but I laugh as, \\"YEAH I FINALLY FOUND IT that DELUXE CD EDITION.\\" But the MAIN reason is the ENERGY, VIGOR and to be COMPLETELY honest, she TOTALLY outdoes ANY version I EVER heard of this song before. LIFE AND EMOTION she puts into this and her songs. Ok, you may hear some straining yeah but you can HEAR her HEART....My absolute very favorites on this New CD are My Love, Lovers Forever, and tho I adore the color RED I LOVE the song \\"I Don't Have to Sleep To Dream\\" because it is CHIC FULL of GREAT ENERGY, LOVE LAUGH AND LIFE....And the TRUE EXAMPLE OF A WOMAN WHO ENDURES AND is PROUD OF HERSELF ....FANTASTIC JOB !!! sorry I am \\"shouting\\" but I KNOW NO ONE WHO COULD DO THIS WELL AT HER AGE... I AM BLOWN AWAY WHEN I WATCH HER LIVE<br /><br />PS Have you EVER heard her 70s recording of Neil Diamond's I AM I SAID --or the duet with son Elijah Blue Allman cover of Joan Jett's hit Crimson & Clover ??<br />  Talk about Fantabulously Moving and FANTASTIC !!  I am getting old but I am not done bein BLOWN AWAY &lt;3 THANK You CHER for DOING it ALL. YOU ARE A WINNER<br /><br />NO ONE CAN DELIVER VOCALS LIKE CHER. THANK GOD for her ENERGY.<br />ROCK ON FANTASTIC MIRACLE

B0034DGPEU|5.0|Very good book. I enjoyed it from the beginning to the end. The characters are well developed and the story moves pretty quickly. It is definitely an enjoyable read, even though the story is very sad at times.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I was reading this book for a book club recomendation.<br /><br />I thought it was written in a  very readable  style and the author made a very  good store out of something very tragic and heart<br /><br />worming.<br /><br />iIwould recomend this bookto someone who like a simple  gentle gradual love story.

B00EGMQIJ0|1.0|The best satires that I've read tend to be written by people who either have intimate first-hand knowledge of a subject or have researched it heavily. Books like Scoop and the Day of the Locust come to mind.<br />Eggers claims he performed no research while writing this book and it certainly reads that way. This is a topic that is ripe for satire, but time and again Eggers misses the ball on all of the important details. This comes across as a facile critique of the trend towards social media written by someone who doesn't actually understand the topic, but thinks he does because he's \\"a great writer\\".<br />This book also fails miserably as a dystopia. A good speculative fiction book will plunge you into its world and force you to figure out what things mean and how they work. Eggers just explains everything as it's introduced sucking any mystery that might have been present.<br />Lastly, the writing is really inconsistent and Eggers could have used a good editor. There are pages of dialogue that serve no purpose: there's no dramatic tension, no character building, nothing. In short, it's drivel.
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|if you ever say &#34;hey, let's go watch something that has alot of explosions and bullets flying everywhere.&#34; this should be good for you.

B00F91SCXC|4.0|4 stars great movie one of the best zombie movies i seen in years it makes u feel likr u there!
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|This is on repeat all the time!!  It's a wonderfully made, chill, summer time album!  I absolutely love all the songs on this album, and I love the fact that most of his songs are long (5 mins. ++) with GREAT beats!!  You can tell he loves music.  This is definitely one of my all time favorite albums!  I love me some JT!!!
B004UJ81IA|5.0|A classic for sure. Humor, frustration and acceptance all come into play with this wonderfully written book. For anyone who has hiked, this is a must read!
B0050CQY1W|5.0|I can listen to this album over and over!  I've always loved her voice, but I really love this album!  It has a songs that you want to get up and just dance to, and great love songs.
B00271B752|5.0|A great classic. Pacino at his finest. An interesting look at corruption in the NYC police department. This movie is based on a real life hero who still resides in upstate New York and lectures about his life experiences.
B00CZF8B68|5.0|I love this song!  Every time I hear it, I want to start dancing! It just really makes you feel good!  Definitely one of my favorite songs.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I liked the pace of this book. The story is a bit far fetched but kept me interested. Grisham had fun with this one.
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|I like the lps game cause of the wide variety that you get rather than the same old stuff that you get with all the other virtual pet/zoo games.
B008MVPF7M|5.0|I love the Duet Sport Mules, and this is my second pair. They are well-cushioned and comfortable, and blue/orange is a fun color combo.
B002RV01QI|5.0|Took me a lot of years to discover Enya, and now I listen to it constantly.  Made me wonder how I managed to miss this for a very long time. There is only one song missing that I believe should have been included, &#34;If I Could Be Where You Are&#34;, and it would have been  absolutely perfect and unforgettable.  Highly recommended.
B005F9TQ9C|5.0|Have always loved all of Dylan's albums--even after he added electric guitars and various classical instruments to his work.  Now I have his works on dvd--how modern!
B004H0M8EA|3.0|I think Jared Diamond is brilliant and love his exploration of history and civilization and its intersection with the natural world, but as in all his books, he goes on and on and on and on... Diamond needs a good editor. We really don't need to be told that the Greenlanders denuded the landcape and caused environmental destruction 50 times. The narrative demonstrates the destruction, Diamond needs to trust his readers to get it without hammering it into our heads. I find myself picking and choosing in this book, and can't imagine ever reading it cover to cover. That said, the picking and choosing is fascinating and well worth it.
B001ANSS5K|4.0|Great story- always love John Green's sidekick characters. Great analogies for us about moving on and leaving things/people/places behind. A window instead of mirrors
B00338QENI|5.0|This was a great book and I would recommend it for everyone. It was very well written and of a extremely interesting subject.
B0088EDMMS|5.0|What is not to like about this movie? I am a child of the 1990's and this movie became a staple in my life as Halloween approaches year after year. Even when I was in Afghanistan I would have my family send this movie to me so I felt somewhat at home.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Me and my son love playing this. Now my husband is hooked too. Its fun and passes time. We love the graphics and the costumes
B00003CXFV|5.0|This is an amazing movie. I love the fact that it is based on a true story. It is amazing what ordinary citizens can accomplish. Julia Roberts did a fabulous job as Erin. One of my favorite movies.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|I enjoyed this series so much that I wish they would start it again. No, really! It was that great.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It is a great app. You go down the track trying to not bump into the obstacles. If you are reading my reviewe and are thinking about getting this app, GET IT!<br />P.S. my bother loves the game.
B000007XUQ|5.0|Never too early to hear Karen Carpenter sing traditional as well as original Carpenters Chrismas songs.  I'll put her Christmas Song up with Nat King Cole's version, and her White Christmas up with Bing Crosby's version.  That's saying a lot!!  Must buy for the holidays.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini does a good job of sharing a story of a family torn apart by poverty and war that has been part of Afghanistan for too long. He weaves the present and past interestingly though each chapter.
B00BV5FVR0|5.0|I'm not as eloquent as Atwood so I'll just say this book was amazing and I was transformed to another world that I didn't wish to leave!
1250038820|5.0|i just went to new york city last weekend and wanted this book so much. i follow it on facebook too
1423140605|5.0|It is a  good book, but I didn't like the cliffhanger. Otherwise the book was awesome. It is a long book though
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|If you've ever been involved with IT projects you can immediately merge into the story and understand the situation. The book has an  excellent way to introduce agile methods in practice.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Loved this book so much, I recently just lost my dog and this book really makes the transition a lot easier!
B00EDPFJA4|4.0|I like this album. I must say that I can actually play it through and I only skip one song. Knowing me, eventually, I will grow to like the song that I skip down the line, lol. Honestly, I still enjoy Take Care better, but overall this is a great album!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I started setting things up and helping a 5 year old. I ended up spending more time the the 5 year old playing.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this game,  the quest to complete that help earn money,  the different wonderful dishes to cook and the best part is that you can set it around your schedule.
B00EQUP3Q6|3.0|2 or 3 great songs at best - starting with Copy of a and Came Back Haunted. The rest of Hesitation Marks picks up right where Year Zero disappoints with its monotonous electronica and contrived lyrics.  Once upon a time every song NIN had a distinct purpose and these 2 albums felt like there were a few good tracks surrounded by soul-less filler. I just saw them live on the Tension tour and the album's less successful tracks were helped greatly by a live show and the thoughtfulness of their trademark special effects.. Unfortunately you can't pack their laser light show into your car or home.  Big Trent needs to channel back to little Trent.
B001NLKXK2|4.0|I read this book for my elderly survey class and it was such a good read. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good story of if anyone wants to know more about Alzheimer's.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|this series really caught my eye with great graphics very good story and lots of true facts that you learn with, I would recommend to my friends, the quality for the down streaming is very very good
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Only read this book if you have a strong faith and/or you are interested in the historical Jesus and will not be offended by information that places little credibility in Jesus the Christ as the son of God.  The author does an excellent job of placing in social, political and geographical context the life and times of Jesus.  He has approached the first several centuries in the middle east with an academics precision.  I will be reading the book (or passages) for information related to that time.
B00FGFVMGA|4.0|If you like Adventure-puzzle games such as Lost City and Grisly Manor, you'll find this game equally enjoyable.  The graphics are top-notch and the game play is complex enough to keep your interest over many days.  I can't wait for more games like this - there are far too few available.
B005FVNIW6|5.0|Epic story, central character concept truly wonderful. There is a deep spirituality in the book that once the fantastic plot is seen leaves a wonderful after taste.
B007THA4FI|5.0|This book is surely an auto-biographic of Rowling's life before fame.  It is extremely detailed with the commonplace horrors and abuse that come with small town living.  An excellent read that requires some discipline to wade through to the very end.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Both my wife and I read this because we became hooked on the TV series first.  We agree that it is somewhat different than the TV series but just as good in our opinion.  In the TV series Sheriff L looks the cowboy type--lean, taciturn, while the book Sheriff L is taciturn but not lean and is somewhat dissolute (hits the alcohol harder than in the TV show) having much trouble getting over his wife's death some 3 years earlier.  Deputy Vic is definitely different in the book--won't say more so as not spill too much.  Other characters are present although the upcoming election which is a major issue in the TV series gets little play here,  The story-line centers around the murders of young men who raped a mentally challenged Cheyenne girl and suffered little penalty for it.  (an interesting sidebar is the effect of family/social network on how each party in this event recovers)  Indian mysticism gets play here particularly when Longmire is out in a fierce Wyoming snowstorm rescuing both one of the young men and Henry, his part Cheyenne friend.  The ending took us both by surprise--no giving away anything here!  We both like the witty dialog--reminds us alot of Robert B Parker's style which we like very much (actually Johnson does thank Parker at the end of the book for his help in developing a writing style).  I also like the frontier setting--a welcome change from the &#34;big city&#34; or &#34;creepy country&#34; environments that seem to underlie a lot of mysteries.  We have just started the series but would recommend reading them in order as later versions do reference earlier events.
B00632HWOG|1.0|Immediate force close every time I try to log in. When I reopen it shows me signed in but messages won't load. Uninstalled and reinstalled but same thing. Useless until that's fixed.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|It is about as long as the Civil War but well worth it. I'm not quite done yet but I have learned so much
B00368PSN2|5.0|This movie stars Jim Caviezel, as a space alien who accidently brings a monster to the Vikings.  It did not do well at the Box office, but now I think it would.  With his Person of Interest fame it might do well now.  I liked the story and the cast was great, John Hurt, Ron Perlman, and Sophie Myles.  The action is great.  Flaming space monsters and Viking funerals kind of a pre Beowulf story.  It's worth watching.
B00FVS3RZQ|5.0|First episode of season for was everything I expected and more. I cant wait for the next episode to see what kind of madness is going to gown due to the last scene of this episode....im sure it will be dramatic and VERY gorey! BTW love all the crazy morbid gore.<br />  Hannah Rouge
B00FPGSPQU|3.0|Funny but what could top the first two movies. It's worth the hour and half if you need a laugh
B005MLP71Y|3.0|My daughter really liked it. (She is 3) The concept of humans stealing honey from the bee's was interesting and then what ultimately would happen if the bee's stopped working. I don't think that will happen any time soon. Amusing film for children although to me it didn't send a positive message relevant to our life. We should all work together? Don't make bee's slaves????
B00BMR4RIG|5.0|Very good for quick detailed weather.<br /><br />Love the long forecast.<br /><br />Has ease of use and class for the busy mom. I really enjoy this app.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Khaled Hosseini knows how to tell a story. I could not put the book down.  I enjoy everything the book.
0307352153|5.0|Susan Cain did a lot of research with this book. She understands the challenges of being an introvert and describes it very well in the good. A great resource.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|My mamaw and I used to play this game when I was a little girl! Sweet memories!!! I absolutely love to play uno!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Very pleased with the app on my Samsung Galaxy 4.  No glitches so far and the features on the app are remarkable.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really like how smooth it runs!!<br />It's really fun and a great time consumer. Keep up the good work c:
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Well written as always.  I did learn more about WWII and the aftermath.  If you like historical fiction, this is a great series.
B00846REIS|5.0|Absolutely breathtaking!!! <3 It made me keep wanting more and more! Can't wait to read the other books in this series!
B0013FBS20|4.0|Good balance of suspense and humor.  Kept you on the edge of your seat!  Love Will Smith as an actor. Not for kids.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great story line and great acting...but most of all you really pull for the hero and heroine to live and beat the odds.
B0074ALZ7Q|1.0|I originally saw this book on a list of 100 Best Books of All Time.  I would not recommend it to ANYONE.  The book has a very thin plot line.  The prose is weak and uncomfortable to read.  The characters are one dimensional and not at all plausible as actual people. There is a Big Secret which comes out close to the end of the book but I had to make my way through many poorly written, dull pages in order to find the secret out.  The book is supposed to be a Thriller but it isn't (by today's standards).  I've decided not to finish reading it.  I was so astonished at how bad the book was that I started browsing information and criticism concerning the author.  One site said that in her day Daphne Du Maurier was considered a &#34;plonk&#34; writer.  Another site said that the book had been in print for 80 years and had sold many, many thousands of copies.  Despite this the site said the prose was poor and &#34;did not stand up&#34; to the thriller aspect of the book.  This book is a waste of time.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|This movie was better than I expected.  The twists and turns were fun to watch and I like the message of the movie.
B00FEN000S|5.0|To celebrate watching this movie again, I had one of the Pacific Rim themed cocktails.  But seriously, I'm not usually fond of mecha/alien movies but I can't stop watching this one.  I love the story, I love the music, the action, the character interaction - it's well done!!!
B00DURHYWC|1.0|We love pink martini but this latest offering is just awful.  No wonder it is only $10.... This was a terrible mistake in our opinion...
B00CEL09QS|5.0|The irony in the movie was good, and the whole story itself was compelling and well done.  :3  I felt impressed and satisfied by the end
1250038820|5.0|Everything about this author's journey is inspiring.  He followed his dream of photography, and people stopped and noticed.  His humanity, his non-judgemental ways, and the way he can tug at your heart strings with the story of this subjects.  Brandon is an artist, and I look forward to his pictures and stories every single day.  His book rocks!
B0014LX420|5.0|I'm not fond of all of her songs, but the Greatest Hits has some of my favorites on there and it's great for long drives
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|Not very far fetched about 2 weeks into the future.. Should lead to discussion but I wonder if it will  catch on or create much \\"Buzz\\". Story is fairly predictable and inevitable conclusion.
B0091REZMW|4.0|And interesting time waster, enjoyable overall but can be frustrating at times especially the constant cost of things. Needs better load times also.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|In case you feel you can be more, but you don't know why you can't. Give yourself the opportunity to read the facts and experience of real woman.
B00C5R7F8G|4.0|There seems to be a current fashion in both fiction and non-fiction to weave two stories together by skipping back and forth in time between both threads of the story. I find this irritating.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Great for putting to action the law of attraction. Experiments that really work! I got some awesome results from this.
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|My first recommendation is: don't watch this on an airplane!  I loaded it up on my Kindle Fire HD and watched it on a recent trip - and found myself contorting into funny positions so that other passengers wouldn't be subjected to the mayhem on my screen!  I also just about jumped out of my skin when the airplane hit some turbulence in an intense moment!<br /><br />All-in-all, this was a great zombie flick.  I'm not a particularly big fan of movies in that category, but I found that the plot, effects and acting in this one kept my attention throughout.  I can also report that it was recommended to me by my college age daughter who is also not a particularly big fan of zombie movies - and she very much enjoyed it.<br /><br />It is not grotesque (or not as graphic anyway) as many movies of this type are.  Nor does it have as many of the deeply suspenseful moments.  You can think of it as living up to its title - it is plays more like a war movie than it does like a horror movie.<br /><br />Probably a good movie for anyone who likes suspenseful shoot-em-up type movies.
B002N5N5R0|5.0|good show..wish there was more gag reels and deleted scenes..i'm more about those things than the actual show...but that is not for the seller that is for kurt sutter to do.
B0089LOG02|5.0|The grandfather of a friend of mine was on the orphan train and always considered himself the luckiest person to have been adopted by a wonderful warm and loving family. The story always fascinated me. Why did we not learn of this in history class? The book was a quick read yet fascinating and very heart warming and heart wrenching. I truly enjoyed it.
B00005JLRT|3.0|I don't remember buying this..but If I did...then okay...it was mean for my dad. i'm sure he enjoyed watching it.
B0062OCNAI|4.0|A suspense filled story of the  power of love and love denied.  Characters are compelling and the final twist is unpredictable.
B000N6TX1S|3.0|charlie dies too early and its hard to tell he dies...he plays a jerk in this movie...don't get to see much of him..too much blood..at least he dog didn't die.
B00COCY67A|5.0|brilliant cd elvis at work and play, highly reccomend to all elvis fans./you just dont appreciate how good he was till you hear cds like this.
B0024FAR5M|4.0|fx packaged this wrong by saying on the lable that there was commentary on an episode when in fact there was not...FX owned up to the wrong typing on it so that was nice...but before a product goes to a store FX needs to check their packaging. this has nothing to do with the seller on here..but the original person..FX
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Great suspense filled read.  I hate books like this because they keep me up at night reading to find out who did it!<br /><br />So far I have not read a David Balducci book I haven't enjoyed.
B0058YPGVQ|5.0|wish there was more special features in this...but kurt sutter should put more in. I guess that is something he should think about
B000ICZD4I|5.0|A story you can really sink your teeth into and lose yourself in the movie! Love to watch it again and again
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|the special effects were great...loved seeing this movie again but from the comfort of my home. much better than the first tron...
B008BHAVDK|5.0|The best cd version available. Only the 45 rpm vinyl version is better for acoustics. Expensive and harder to get.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|dad loved this movie and the behind the scenes and other disc in it...all movies should have a ton if behind the scenes and deleted scenes and gag reels.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|Movie arrived within a couple of days. Both disks worked with no issues. My 1 1/2 year old grand daughter loved it.
B008JFUPFI|1.0|Unfortunately, the standard set by \\"Man of Steel\\" was not only for \\"greatest cinematic disappointment this year\\" but \\"only film I have ever walked out on in over thirty years' worth of movie-going.\\"<br />  To put this in perspective, let me say that superhero movies are probably my favorite kind,that it all started with the the original Superman back in 1978, and that I watched the trailers for this film on Youtube numerous times and with growing anticipation (and in my opinion whoever managed to cobble those exciting trailers together out of this colossal mess either deserves some sort of an award, or to be tarred and feathered for tricking so many people into wasting their money and time).<br />  I had no problem with the cast (well, except with Zod, whose voice and accent struck me as a trifle too 'hick' for the role; but maybe this was just in contrast to Crowe--or in reaction to my having recently seen Cumberbatch's Khan in [[ASIN:B00F35BV64 Star Trek Into Darkness]]); I just had a huge problem with what the script called for them to do. It began with the first scene, which I thought was distinctly TMI, hit a high point when--SPOILER!--Mrs. Kent unhesitatingly sent her husband back into the path of a tornado to save the family dog (was there something about their marriage we weren't being told?), settled into eye-rolling disgust when each new scene made it clear Superman was not really going to be allowed to do anything either heroic or even half-way competent, and finally ended when, just after the last battle began (at least, I think it was the last battle: it certainly should have been by that time), I couldn't take the thought of another ten minutes of boredom, ducked out of my seat and fled up the aisle.<br />  I spent the drive home assuring myself that my money hadn't been completely thrown away, as at least I had a new measuring-stick for badness. Previously, the worst superhero movie I'd seen was [[ASIN:B005LJITS0 Green Lantern (2011)]], and the only other movie I'd even thought about walking out on from boredom was Mel Gibson's [[ASIN:B001H4NXCK Maverick]]--and in the end, I hadn't done it.<br />  Which just goes to show, I suppose, that even when \\"terminally putrid\\", Superman is special.
B009477BOI|5.0|I watched this recently with my 3 & 5 year olds and they loved it.  I was afraid, that it would be a bit slow, as these older movies tend to have different pacing to todays rapidly moving movies, but they were gluded to it from the begining to the end.  Only during the solo with Truely did they loose interest... for about 30 seconds.
B00F0N7JUG|2.0|First off, I absolutely loved this movie.  Buy this movie! Just don't buy this version for the Gypsy Danger figure.<br /><br />I initially pre-ordered the 3D edition of Pacific Rim when it was available.  When this version with the Gypsy Danger figure was offered I immediately had to own it.  Years back, I purchased a Toy Story 3 Bluray set that had a Buzz Lightyear figure.  The Buzz Lightyear figure in the Toy Story 3 set had articulated arms and legs, made lazer sounds and I think even could say \\"To Infinity and Beyond.\\"<br /><br />I know, stupid right, but like the package said, it was a figure. The actual Toy Story 3 disks were in a little plastic \\"film can\\" that attached to Buzz's back.  But it could be detached and you actually had a figure.<br /><br />This Gypsy Danger set though.  not even close.  The Gypsy danger figure is not a figure.  Rather it is a solid plastic \\"statuette\\". Nothing moves.  Sure it would look nice sitting on a shelf as a conversation piece.  The disks are in a swing out spindle on a hinge.  I can see this hinge breaking after using it with normal wear and tear from flipping it in and out to get disks on and off the spindle.<br /><br />I tried to find various info on this particular edition.  And it was listed as a figure on various sources.  Had I known it was a piece of molded plastic, I would have just gotten the regular 3D set in a bluray slipcase/box.<br /><br />So to recap.  Pacific Rim awesome!!! Buy it!!  Help del Toro get funding to make a sequel.  Just buy a different edition than this one.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|Love this game!! Play as often as I can... if you need another neighbor, Add me. DYQKUZM  I visit often and answer requests :)
B00F8L2VO4|4.0|This is good for beginners, but sometimes it is confusing as to what the correct answer is.  But still a good learning tool, considering it is free...
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|This is a summary of others previous research. It was done well and is very readable, but Mr. Aslan does not use the neutral language of a true historian. His bias is readily apparent and takes away from his work.
B00F36ZHHC|1.0|I wanted to get this app to find how to get to some places I plan on going to...just to find out this is a cheap knock off that poses as a bad excuse for Google earth.
B00CL0J99K|3.0|this movie has great special effects as the previous Iron man movies.  However they kind of ruined the movie in the way they portrayed the Mandarin.  They should be more comic book correct. I don't know if Stan Lee saw the script but he shouldn't have let them change the character.
B007BLCGNU|4.0|I'm not sure I think Leo did a good job or not.  If he was accurate in the portrayal then Hoover was a nut.  It was a rather fascinating view into the politics of the times then and how events shaped the development of the agency.  Cinematography was great, costumes great, most acting pretty good.  Everything is pretty much black or grey though as far as coloring.  It's not filmed in black and white but the feeling is monochromatic.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|We love it so much I am going to purchase another!  It is so nice to be able to have the ipad away from the TV and utilize the TV speakers.
B00E9P959O|5.0|My opinion is that this remixed version is a vast improvement over the original version, and the album is now listenable from start to finish (and a great album).  That said, as others have pointed out in other reviews there are a few mixing mistakes (and/or perhaps recording mistakes) here and there, but the overall improvement is so vast that those problems are very minor in comparison.  Thank you Rush for doing this remaster.<br /><br />I am one of the people who considered the original version so badly mixed that it was nearly impossible to listen to all the way through at once.  I would often try to listen to one song at a time, and by doing so realized that there were really great songs in there (\\"How It Is\\" in particular is one of my favorite of the newer rush songs, and even the original mix isn't bad).<br /><br />But it took quite a while for me to even give this album much of a chance because it was so strangely uncomfortable to listen to it.  I was so confused and disappointed by this that I ended up researching it and found others having the same problem, and talking about mixing problems and the concept of a \\"noise war\\".  I listen to music for musicality, not for how loud I can get it (I will never understand the opinion of some that volume = power, as power is in the music itself).  I cannot begin to understand why someone would mix an album in this loud \\"noise war\\" way for a band that has years of being clear and crisp and musical, not loud and messy.  Frankly, the mix of their earliest albums sounds better to me than the original version of this album.<br /><br />Anyway, I really warmed up to individual songs on it once I heard them separately, such as \\"One Little Victory\\" in concert.  So when I saw remixes of 2 songs on a compilation I bought it just for that purpose, and I was very pleased with them.  I was very excited when I saw the entire album was going to be remixed.<br /><br />While the original version of this album had a particularly severemixing problem, I do wonder why the vast majority of newer albums (by most bands) sound so badly mixed in comparison to older ones.  Perhaps it is more than just this \\"noise war\\".  I don't know much about mixing albums, but if the people doing the mixing are using computers and software over older equipment and human decision-making, I think that is a very serious mistake and could be the source of the problem (and I am a software engineer and musician, so I don't say that lightly).  If so, perhaps a simple answer is to go back to using whatever equipment and techniques were used to mix albums like Permanent Waves (my favorite Rush album and a great example of a great mix).  Newer technology isn't always better (in fact, I find it all too often to be worse).

B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed playing this at the end of my day as a way to unwind. I am looking forward to more levels. I found the puzzles were just the right amount of difficulty.
0425252868|5.0|.  A truly uplifting, if almost unbelievable, story of the real men who served their countries with honor in WWII
B0060ZJ7BC|3.0|I'd recommend a viewing of this film, but I wouldn't spend good money on it.<br /><br />One thing I have a question about is why the film hyped Carlos Pena so much. Perhaps Beane (Pitt) was calling him an All-Star or potential Rookie of the Year in order to gin up his trade value, but when Pena was traded he was hitting a lowly .218 with only 7 home runs. And while he later went on to have some high home run totals, through 2013 he had a lifetime batting average of a miniscule .233.<br /><br />Not a big fan of Philip Seymour Hoffman and this film didn't help that. If the coach he played, Art Howe, is as boorish and lifeless as he was portrayed by Hoffman in this film, than I guess Hoffman nailed it and did a great acting job here. If Howe is/was not that way, than the acting was as bad as I thought.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I have to say I am in love with this series.  The author keeps the readers interest from the start and keeps on moving the story along.  The events surrounding America are believable, I can almost feel the tension, the jealousy, and the fears as they happen.  The author instills just enough mystery in the story to keep a reader wondering and hoping for the next event.  Well done Kiera I can't wait for the last book to release.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This a great book with a great story line with amazing characters and a lot of humor. Two thumbs up :)
B005HJWWW8|4.0|It doesn't just add volume, it adds fullness to the overall sound of the headphones. I bought this in conjunction with the Vmoda Crossfade LP. After the initial headphone burn in, i plugged this in and the headphones had a much fuller sound than it already was. It's very easy to use. I mostly use the flat EQ and it does wonders already
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I use it every day and it´s very convinient, I can plug it on the tv in the living room or in the kids room, the configuration took longer than I expeceted but besides that everything is great
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This works great.  It allows me to use my netbook to push the chrom tab to my tv so that everyone see that tab.  This alows me to go to tv website to push them to the tv.  I am even able to use roll20.net to play pathfinder with my Kids on the TV.
B0026KX6TY|4.0|Entertaining while also giving a good insight to the real chess world. Having played tournament level chess myself, I saw many of the same idiosyncrasies and behaviors  from the adults in this film. Also the pressure on parents is very well brought out!  Well worth the watch!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This was a great keybord replacment from my nexus 7.  It makes it much easyer to type on my tablet.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Whether you are a Christian or not, this book will change your understanding of the time in which Jesus of Nazareth lived, the man himself and his disciples. I could not put the book down. Aslan could teach writing as well as history. The quality of his scholarship is earth-moving. Now I have read two upending histories in my life, the other being Toynbee's &#34;Study of History.&#34;
B0063GORYU|4.0|Although I don't play any other games on my iPhone, I Enjoy this game easy to see and like graphic choices
B005HJWWW8|2.0|It was a very good bass booster and equalizer while it lasted, now it only plays out of one side of headsets, so only 1 channel....I'm very disappointed in the longevity of this product.
039916409X|5.0|Tapping as explained by Margaret Lynch has by far been the best thing I've ever done to rid myself of the money blocks I've had for years. I have felt decades of shame and false beliefs about money fall from me as I've done her tapping work.  And the miracles keep coming!<br /><br />I heartily recommend this book...use it and change your life!
B00CSCJ09K|5.0|Simply i love it; all the songs and it come to me much faster than i spect it so i love it
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Ordered this up for a bedroom TV.  It found the network without a problem but would not connect at all.  I tried different router settings but it was a no go.  I am a pretty tech savvy guy and can usually work through things but will not be trying this again.  I ordered another ROKU unit to replace this and had it set up in 10 minutes.
B00632HWOG|3.0|I liked the old format.  Just can't get used to the new. Having problems getting back to inbox after moving around to other folders.  Actually have to reload page.
B00EXVZW6E|1.0|because everytime, I clicked on an object, it didn't work.  I had to use the hint button before it would.

B00F7YHDWC|2.0|This game was allot of fun. It was engaging and the difficulty built really well. But the ads... They took up the entire screen and wouldn't let it go. It was so obnoxious. It's like I'm on my laptop, surfing the web and getting pop up ads. I wanted to like it but I uninstalled it instead.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Incredible! I love the character development this show has created and the actors are amazing. I can't wait to see what else season 4 has in store for us as viewers!
1582701709|5.0|I love it! and I will recommend it. You will like it! Every time I read it, I find something new.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|When I read comics as a child, I always wondered why couldn't they make a movie as good as the book I was reading. This movie, by Joss Wheadon, has done just that. The character development was spot on. Each actor did a perfect job at bringing their character to life. The set up, the story, bringing the main characters together, the battles amongst themselves, the grand final. Perfect ! I've seen this movie three times, and every time I see something I missed before. I never been able to sit through all the credits at the end of any movie. The final scene makes it totally worth it. This movie has definitely set the standard for all the superhero movies that will follow.
B003Z0BWR2|5.0|Love it!! Make more please<br />You are a really great writer congratulations on a best seller novel<br />I recommend this book to be one you just can't put down. Read it!
