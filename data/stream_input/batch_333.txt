B00009V8Z9|5.0|When I first listened to this album, it was too and from work and I wasn't exactly focusing all of my attention to the music. Some of the catchier songs stuck in my head and made me think that the album was pretty decent. However, after repeated and more careful listens, it is 100% clear that this album is an unmistakeable masterpiece. The lyrics are magnificent & even the musical backdrops are gorgeously composed of guitars, drums, horns, pianos & other live instruments.<br />The best track on the album is easily \\"Belief\\", followed closely by \\"I Don't Want to Be\\", \\"Just Friends\\" & \\"More than Anyone\\". The album's singles \\"Chariot\\" & \\"Follow Through\\" are also phenominal tracks that unfortunatley got over looked when it came time for them to pick up steam at radio playlists and other media outlets such as MTV & VH1.<br />However, for the fans who are lucky enough to find this talented young artist, you will see that there is not a weak moment on the album and that every song is precious in its own way. \\"Over-Rated\\", \\"Meaning\\" & \\"Nice to Meet You (Anyway)\\" are other brilliant numbers that show that this talented new comer shows enough promise to hopefully have a long and successful career.<br />This is hands down the best album of 2003 no question. I'm just sorry I didn't give it the attention it deserves at first. If you are in a record store and see this album do not hesitate, buy this album immediatley. I can't wait to see him on tour and I will keep my ear to the underground to hear about all updates on him.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Since Incubus' first full-length album, Fungus Amongus, the band has been changing on each album.  This is the album that is the most listenable.  Although still holds the originality that the other albums have, the songs on Morning View all sound &quot;normal,&quot; a little bit closer to pop.  This is the album that shows off Brandon Boyd's vocal talents the most, but, as a result, hides the instrumentalists.  It's a good place to start for people who don't know the music of Incubus other than Drive and perhaps Pardon Me (both on Make Yourself).  It's not my favorite Incubus album, which is either Make Yourself or S.C.I.E.N.C.E., but I love Incubus so I like all of their stuff.  There are some awesome songs here.  Incubus dares to be a &quot;rock&quot; band and still put out gentler tracks like  11am,  Mexico,  Warning,  Echo,  Are You In?,  and especially Aqueous Transmission. These gentler songs are combined with the awesome traditional rock songs like Nice to Know You, Circles, Just a Phase, Blood on the Ground, Have You Ever, and Under My Umbrella which has an incredibly sing-along-able chorus.   Morning View is an amazing addition to anybody's cd collection.
B00005JKZV|2.0|To begin, let me say that I have never read a single Lord of the Rings book and therefore have no idea what the original plot of The Two Towers was like. However, I can say that after seeing the film I was disappointed - considering how friends who are Tolkien freaks had told me it was the BEST book in the series. After seeing the first movie (Fellowship of the Ring), I had been impressed and had therefore put some credence in my friends' declarations that the movie would be brilliant. Yet when I finally got to see the film, I felt, if anything, bored and irritated. And my friends, who had been drooling for this film, came out of the cinema feeling very disappointed. According to them, the story and several of the characters had<br />been appallingly altered. I don't know about any of that, but I do have the following criticisms:<br />First, the film was too long for its content. The same story could have been told in half the time and might have even been exciting. Instead, it just went on and on and on and on....<br />Second, there were too many reaction shots. Someone would say something, then the camera would fix on the other person's reaction - at least 12000 times through the film! If they'd cut most of these reaction shots out they'd have probably saved a good half hour of film and it might not have lagged so much.<br />Third, that Gandalf guy was really likeable in the first film but in this film he became a two dimensional character. Not only that, for some reason he was made into a really powerful magician guy who didn't seem to have any weaknesses at all. I went from liking him in the first film to finding him annoying and wondering why all the other characters kept fawning around him. Also, given the ease with which he and that tiny little army he brought with him at the end of the film destroyed that supposedly invincible Orc army, I was left wondering why he didn't just do that in the first place. Would have saved a lot of time and wouldn't have been as overblown as the \\"Gandalf saves the day\\" scene was.<br />Fourth, there was no tension in this film. It was obvious that the good guys were going to win in almost every situation. When that Aragorn guy went over the cliff and fell into the river, I thought it might have been some important plot development (because in this sort of film, someone falling off a cliff into a river is bound to survive). Instead, it was just an incident that was meant to put us on the edge of our seats (if we were 5 years old, say) and also, to waste as much film time as possible. Even the big battle scene was hard to get concerned about because Gandalf had told them that he'd be coming back to save them in a few days.<br />Fifth, if Christopher Lee's character was such a scary, all-powerful magician (like Super-Gandalf), why did he just stand around looking shocked when those tree monsters attacked his tower? Couldn't he have zapped them or turned them into newts or something?<br />To sum up, I don't know what they were thinking when they made this film. I guess they ran out of puff after the first one. I hope the third film redeems the series because this one blew.blown as the \\"Gandalf saves the day\\" scene was. <BR>Fourth, there was no tension in this film.

B00005JM0B|4.0|this mvie was great, arnold will always be great as the terminator, it had action and comedy, its a little different from the previous two, but it still rocks.
B00009V7P8|3.0|Ok.  For starters, I'm not a big folk fan.  But I remember being up late one night and watching a program featuring Rolling Stone Magazines new artists to watch.  Damien Rice was featured with \\"Volcano\\" and I was enchanted immediately.  Now, as a huge Jeff Buckley fan, I will admit that there were slight reminders of our dearly departed friend, but I am not one to put him on the pedestal as the next Buckley.  <BR>I was attached to some of the songs immediately while others took me a little longer.  I'm a sucker for a cello and beautiful lyrics so this album is an interesting combination. <BR>My favorites are: Delicate, Cheers Darlin', I Remember, and of course, Volcano.<BR>It's a perfect cd to listen to on a rainy day when you want just chill out.
B00005YW4H|1.0|Horrible CD, how did she win all those grammys, I mean these songs are horrible.  I wouldn't recommend this CD to anyone. And all those who like her need to explore other music genres.I'd give this a 1/2 star, cause it is not even worth 1.

B000002J20|3.0|If you're a total Yes fan, you must own this and every other pre-Union album on every possible format (OK maybe you can skip the 8-track tape).  Yes fans already know the last part of the 4th song is one of prog rock's finest moments.<br />If you want to hear innovative experimental music from the early 1970's that indy bands are now stealing in the 21st century, you must own this.  <br />However if you can't tolerate long stretches of annoying, padded rock epics and Jon Andersen's insane lyrics (as well as insane liner notes) then you will absolutely hate this.  &quot;We fled from the sea . . .whole!&quot;<br />I should point out that the vinyl version's album cover is quite nice with Roger Dean's double cover and the inside full of interesting pictures; the CD booklet and cassette liner don't do it justice.  However the remastered CD does sound pretty &quot;clean&quot; if that floats your boat.
B000069AUI|5.0|Although it isn't as great as their beautifully done debut album &quot;Parachutes&quot;, it's incredibly good.  The album starts off with the nicely done &quot;Politik&quot;, which makes better use of the piano playing then most other songs in the album.  &quot;In My Place&quot; was the first single that came on the radio, but I prefer their third single &quot;The Scientist&quot; to any oother song on the CD.  But of course, we can't forget the second single, &quot;Clocks&quot;, my second favoriet song on the album, this song has more actual vocals than the others do, and it's simply one of the best.  <BR>  All of the other songs are good on the CD, and it simply is one of the best alternative albums in the past ten years, same goes for the band, these guys are going to be legends.

1573921394|2.0|This book is worth reading for the impact it has and continues to have on economics. For the most part, we still live in Keynesian world. However, Keynes could have used some formal instruction on clarity, his writing is a mess. I found myself laughing out loud to some of the passages in this book. It is a shame because Kenyes was, by all accounts, witty and concise in person. This book is anything but. <br />I would rather read up on the Envelope theorem that be dragged through this book again.
0385507755|3.0|I think some of the reviewers here are being a little too melodramatic when reviewing this book, why get angry? LOL. The book does snag your interest, but then kind of loses its grip about 3/4 through. Still, it is one of the most entertaining books I have read in awhile. Yes I am sure some of it is jazzed up a bit for shock value. For instance, James is convinced  he is such a tough guy, and the other patients were so afraid of him in the recovery unit, that  they were afraid to look at him. Um, no. If Mr. Frey walked into the rehab unit bone thin with skin hanging off his body and could barely walk, I doubt they were so terrified of him. As a matter of fact he would have been put in his place several times over. But I suppose the bad boy image sells more. As far as the grammar and punctuation goes, I like the free style. Not every novel has to be Shakespearean. It is almost like poetry, and conveys his message perfectly. Remember a junkie wrote this, not a scholar. I had one problem, Mr. Frey says in the book, that at age 23, he has wasted his life on drugs. Now, this is almost laughable. At 23 your life is just beginning , I am sure Mr. Frey went through some tough times in his youth, but at age 23 , he is hardly a hardened junkie/criminal.  I do appreciate that he doesn't blame his addictions on genetics or his upbringing, I also have this belief that addiction is your own choice, and do not blame it on genetics or your childhood. At least he doesn't have a \\"poor me\\" attitude. I much prefer his bad ... image over the usual whiney victim syndrome. I also like his view on AA and its higher power bologna. All in all, good book, whether it is juiced up a little or not doesn't matter, Mr. Frey makes his point, he makes it loud , and he makes it clear. Recommended highly. I would give it 3 1/2 stars.

B00008J2DQ|3.0|Sure it's good, but so was their other two cds. And surprise, surprise...it sounds just like them. The only problem with Godsmack is every song (other than the occasional masterpiece such as :&quot;Serenity&quot; and the opening to &quot;I Am&quot;) sounds the same. Lyrically AND musically the whole cd is a monotonous journey into what they already have done. Though, if you love the way Godsmack sounds and can't get enough of them, you really can't go wrong with this cd.
0385504209|5.0|This has got to be one of the most amazing mysteries I have EVER read.  I initially resisted this book becuase of all the initial hype (don't ask!) but finally decided to give it a shot- I'm so glad I did.  This book grabbed me from the first few pages and I stayed up all night to read it.  As a first time mom of a 3 month old, willing to give up precious hours of sleep is a BIG deal!  I wish this book had been another 300 pages long, I did not want it to end.  My only complaint is that I wish the publishers had included illustrations of the three paintings discussed in the novel, instead, I just hopped online to see if I could catch some of the things Dan Brown talked about.<br />Loved the book and also &quot;Angels and Demons&quot; is very good too!
B00005V9HA|5.0|One of the goriest films ever made, Re-animator is one of those horror movies that doesn't take itself too seriously. I guess you could call it a cult film, because many people find it too offensive to watch. Herb West is a twisted scientist who was recently kicked out of a Switzerland medical school for his experiments, which he brings to his new school (a name which I forget). He rooms with some guy named Dan (who's dating the dean's daughter) and brings his crazy re-animation experiments into Dan's life. Re-animator had some of the best one-liners for a horror film, including &quot;cat dead-details later&quot; and the whole talking head dialogue. I especially loved this DVD, which includes about 6 TV spots and the original trailer, ads that had a warning about how gory this film was (you just don't see that anymore). <BR>The DVD also includes a deleted scene (if added, would've messed up the plot), loads of commentary, and biographies, so while the film only lasts about 86 minutes, the extras will keep you busy for a few more hours.
B00003CXDB|5.0|This is a classic movie about not taking the easy way out and working hard to make it in life.  Bud Fox (played by Charlie Sheen) finds that out the hard way when he teams up with Gordon Gecko (played by Michael Douglas.  A classic quote from the speech that Gecko made to the shareholders....&quot;Greed is good&quot;... Another classic quote by Gecko &quot;Money never sleeps...&quot;  This movie is a must have in your DVD collection. Take care - Chad Castorina
B000002NFM|1.0|I borrowed this album from a friend based on all the good reviews here. And I forced myself to listen to the entire CD. <br />Fuel My Fire is the best track of the album. But even that doesn't have any musical qualities to speak of. Listening to it seems like a chore. This is the number one album of all time on my list of worst albums. <br />This is not music...this is garbage. Don't waste your money...or your mind.
0792151712|4.0|Titanic was released in 1997 with a running time of 194 minutes. It was released by Paramount Pictures and directed by James Cameron.  The cast included Leonardo DiCaprio (Jack Dawson), Kate Winslet (Rose Dewitt Bukater), Billy Zane (Cal Hockley), Frances Fisher(Ruth Dewitt Bukater) and Bill Paxton (Brock Lovett)<br />Titanic is a romance, an adventure and a thriller all in one.  As the movies opens, it is seen in the present day setting with Brock Lovett a member of a salvage team, who are investigating the remainders of the wrecked Titanic at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.  Brock and his team are in search of the &quot;Heart of the Ocean&quot;, which is a 56 carat diamond lost when the ship went down.  Brock found a picture of a young girl wearing the diamond necklace and thought that this could aide in finding out what happened to the diamond.<br />Rose Dewitt Bukater a 101 year old woman calls Brock and identifies the girl in the picture. Together they return to the salvage site.  The movie then switches back to 1912 when Rose was 17 years old and she tells Brock how she came to be on the Titanic.<br />Rose tells how she was to marry a rich, obnoxious snob, Cal Hockley,that was arranged by her mother Ruth Dewitt Bukater in order to save her from becoming penniless.  Also boarding the ship was Jack Dawson a young man that won a third class ticket minutes before the ship was to sail during a poker game.<br />Jack notices Rose while she was standing on the first class deck and later comes to her rescue when she was attempting to end her life. From that moment on, Rose and Jack began a love affair.  They continued to sneak around secretly to meet.  From all the time that they spent together, Cal  became very upset and decided to seek revenge on Jack.  Cal falsely accused Jack of stealing a diamond from him that led to Jack being arrested.<br />As the movies continues the Titanic hits an iceberg, which causes the ship to sink.  As the passengers are evacuating, Rose is desperately searches for the man that she has fallen in love with &quot;Jack&quot;.  Together they go into the ocean on a piece of wood, waiting to be rescued.  But as faith has it, the wood is only big enough for one of them and Jack sacrifices his life in order to save the life of the women he loves &quot;Rose&quot;.<br />I rated this movie a 4 star movie, even though it ended with a tragedy, the love story however kept the plot moving.  It's definitely a movie that I could watch over and over.

0142004235|4.0|If Oprah Winfrey was looking to get the American public (and perhaps even the world) interested in reading \\"classic\\" literature she could have not chosen a better selection than John Steinbeck's \\"East of Eden.\\"  This is certainly not the \\"tamer\\" Steinbeck that I read in high school English class.  While we may not even think twice about it today, \\"Eden\\" must have been simply scandalous when it was originally published in 1952 with murder, prostitution, and adultery just some of the more \\"adult\\" issues explored in this epic novel.<br />Despite its intimidating length, \\"East\\" moves along quickly as we follow the life of Adam Trask - from his East Coast childhood and troubled relationship with his brother to businessman and father of two sons with equally complex relations of their own.  As the title suggests, the book is a modern retelling of the biblical story of Cain and Abel story.  As with most of the \\"classics,\\" the novel is rife with topics and themes to deeply delve into and discuss with your book club.  My only criticisms are that the \\"good vs. evil\\" angle gets a bit heavy-handed at times and, for me, the novel loses some steam in the final quarter - but these are certainly not enough to not heartily recommend the work.<br />The nice thing about \\"Eden\\" is if you choose not to take the \\"literary\\" route, you can still be simply entertained and enthralled by Steinbeck's plot and characters.  There is enough suspense and intrigue that make it not terribly different from many of today's bestsellers.
B00008G9JN|5.0|I have listened to it all in every format and this is some great remastering! for once.<br />In response to the reviewer asking if it is possible to botch the earlier cd pressings -<br />Absolutely! But the difference was the technology. 16 bit to 24 bit to SACD to DVD-A with 6 layers to show off more depth in the music. Give us a break!<br />Are you still using the old wind-up gramaphone?<br />This is one of the best Tull albums out there!<br />Don't be fooled by people who guess at their reviews.<br />It is my favorite Tull album as a whole.<br />If you like Tull at all then this is a must have!!<br />Go on, be a man, surprise yourself.........
B00005B3Z6|5.0|i have seen the first season of queer as folk from showtime and it follows pretty close to this series, except the american one is a lot longer.  both are good on their own terms, but i wish that the british one was a bit longer.  the charcters in the british version are excellently played, and the accents are just awesome, which adds a little something to the show.  for some reason i really like an accent.  this set is only 2 discs each containing two hour long epiodes.  in those episodes there is a lot going on, but it never seems like it is to muchthat is part of what i really like about the british version, i think it is very balanced.  especially for being so short.  the characters have different names than the american version, but each one is easy to identify between the two.  like i said earlier many of the same events happen in the british one that happen in the american one, so anyone who has seen the american one will recognize the stories portrayed in the british one.  all in all this is a pretty good investment and a good solid 4 hours of entertainment.  i twould make a nice edition to any collection so i say why not, go out and get.
B000002VC3|5.0|1982's \\"Eye In The Sky\\" is an Alan Parsons Project classic, and it remains the group's best-selling album, thanks to the lush, hugely-popular title track. While the album's theme, if it has one, is a little unclear (a look at spirituality & the human race's past, perhaps?), it contains all the hallmarks of the Project's sound: fantastic prog-pop & melodies (co-written by Parsons & Eric Woolfson) , sweeping orchestrations by Andrew Powell, and amazing studio wizardry & musical performances. As already mentioned, the title song is the Project's signature tune, a Top Five smash on the singles chart, and featuring a rich vocal turn by Woolfson. Other great songs include the spacey \\"Children Of The Moon,\\" \\"Gemini,\\" \\"Silence And I,\\" the rockers \\"You're Gonna Get You're Fingers Burned\\" and the awesome \\"Psychobabble\\" (a Project favorite to this day), \\"Step By Step,\\" and the stirring \\"Old And Wise,\\" as well as the classic Project instrumentals \\"Sirius\\" (the lead-in to \\"Eye In The Sky\\"), and \\"Mammagamma.\\" Along with Eric Woolfson, there are other wonderful vocals throughout by David Paton, Chris Rainbow, Colin Blunstone, Elmer Gantry, and Lenny Zakatek, and tremendous musicianship from such Project staples as guitarist Ian Bairnson and drummer Stuart Elliot. A sparkling album from beginning to end, \\"Eye In The Sky\\" is an all-time Project classic.
B000059GEH|3.0|Great actresses... Great plot idea... So what went wrong?<br />I was certain I would love this movie but I felt very disappointed after watching it. It was very predictable but that wouldn't truly destroy a light-hearted movie like this. Although gags such as Marilyn Monroe's character's refusal to wear her glasses in public were entertaining, overall the movie wasn't very funny, even in comparison to other movies of its time.<BR> <BR>The movie starts off at a moderate pace as the women decide to catch a millionare. Then the movie speeds through the chase. You see very little relationship development. What really destroyed it was the sudden, abrupt ending. The distribution of screen time was uneven; Two of the girls suddenly show up married at the end of the movie without much leading up to their ultimate decisions while Lauren Bacall's character is seen during all her decisionmaking. <br />The movie, all in all, is cute. The actresses still give a great performance (although I found Betty Grable's character somewhat irritating) despite the script's flaws. It is a light-hearted movie that will make you smile when you are not in the mood for a drama or in-depth plot. Bottom line: Just rent this movie, or better yet check it out from your local library if possible.
B00001U0GQ|4.0|Although Last of the Mohicans is an excellent movie, it cannot receive five stars in this review.  When one adapts a movie from a novel there is responsibility to portray the same ideas and characters as the original novel.  Almost all interesting issues from the original have been removed (Cora's mixed blood for example), and Daniel Day-Lewis' character is given everything interesting Uncas and Chingachook did, unfortunately reducing them to mere trophy friends.<BR>    <BR>   However, even given its inadequacies with the story, the movie is still very good.  It's exciting and touching with an ending that moves even the more stubborn viewers.  Daniel Day-Lewis is given some of the world's cheesiest lines (\\"I will find you.  No matter how long it takes, no matter how far, I will find you!\\"), but he delivers them with such conviction and sincerity that they are believable, and wonderful.  A lesser actor delivering such lines would be laughable.  He does a fantastic job.  <br />    As the villain, Wes Studi also deserves accolades.  He is methodical in his revenge and calm as he delivers it; it's obvious that he has thought this out for a long period of time, and is willing to wait as long as it takes.  He is so intense that even having him stand in a corner is intimidating.  Rarely are there villains in movies that viewers can connect with and understand, and yet still fear, but Wes Studi pulls it off.  <BR>     <BR>   All in all, the action is exciting, the villain is mean, and the hero is dashing.  What else could one ask for?

B00005V9HA|5.0|For all you fans of the movie I just want to let you know that  the millennium edition is the uncut version. This version is unrated its not rated R and has all the gore in the movie as well. This is the 86 min version the version the makers of the film wanted. The 96 min version is a joke all thats added in is storyline no gore. The makers cut all that because it was to much story. But if you want to see it its on the second disk under exstended scenes. This movie was never subimitted to the ratings bord. They relesed it unrated becuase they new if they wanted to get a R rating they would of had to cut gore and sexuality out to aviod geting the old X rating they did not want to do that. So they relesed it unrated and kept all the gore and sexuality in.
B00005JKN9|1.0|Like the Emperor's New Clothes, this film appears to be more than it actually is.<br />Basically, they creators have taken a very uninteresting and not very innovative story line from a \\"B\\" Western, and I can think of many \\"B\\" Westerns that had more interesting stories, and clothed it in fancy period sets.<br />Ironically, the only real Irishman in the film has to do a New York accent while the Americans have to put on fake Irish accents.<br />Dull, dull, dull (and I consider myself a fan of Scorsese).  As tedious as a bad Merchant Ivory film.
B00005JLXE|5.0|Viewers like the one from Wheaton, IL below who dismiss Daredevil as nothing more than a movie cashing in on the success of Spiderman and X-Men obviously don't know what they're talking about.  Daredevil is the sleekest, darkest, and most atmospheric superhero action movie since the original Batman.  The uneasy chemistry between Affleck's Daredevil and Garner's Elektra plays out perfectly, and Colin Farrell cuts a deliciously sinister villain as Bullseye.<br />If you're into plain vanilla, candy-coated superhero movies with two-dimensional characters and teenage romances, then by all means watch Spiderman.  However, if you--like me--prefer edgier superhero fare, don't miss out on Daredevil.
B0000028M7|5.0|I know a lot of hardcore AIC fans who think that Facelift is the best CD by this band but in my opinion they were at the top of their game for Dirt. This album has my two favorite Alice in Chains songs ever, the hard-rocking &quot;Them Bones&quot; and the smoldering, explosive &quot;Angry Chair&quot;. &quot;Down in a Hole&quot; and &quot;Rooster&quot; are classic AIC songs, as well as &quot;Would?&quot;, which a lot of people consider the definitive Alice in Chains song. <br />Jerry Cantrell is awesome on this CD, just listen to the solo in &quot;Them Bones&quot;. But not only does he play some sweet sludgy grunge riffs like on &quot;Dam That River&quot;, but also plays the ballad-like &quot;Down in a Hole&quot; with equal dexterity. Layne Staley sounds best on this album compared to the others in my opinion- listen to &quot;Angry Chair&quot;, which is a song that's set apart by the awesome vocals. It's a shame there can never be another Alice in Chains song due to Layne's tragic death. By the way, if you already own all the AIC albums and you want some more, give Jerry Cantrell's solo stuff a shot, it's better than it gets credit for.
B000002TP7|5.0|Length - 59:26<BR>20 awesome tracks on one incredible, expansive record. I could probably write an entire book about how groundbreaking and awesome this album is, but I'll try to make this brief review suffice. First and foremost, I don't think any hip-hop/punk rock group has ever been more forceful, enthusiastic and skilled than The Beastie Boys. This cd is so great because it wasn't a record company manifesto, it was a bunch of friends working really hard to produce something they liked, something very real and unique. Not to say that the music execs didn't enjoy this; obviously it received immense, condign success, but that wasn't the point. This heartfelt recording touched everyone, not just pop culture. I don't think I've ever met someone who didn't like Ill Communication. This truly is a classic album that I think should be in everyone's possession.
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer is the hottest guy I have ever seen.  His song &quot;your body is a wonderland&quot; is SO TRUE.  Listening to John Mayer reminds me of a combination of Mozart, the Beatles, and Justin Timberlake. You have to buy this CD!!  The only bad thing about the cd is the stupid boxes on the CD.  Whatever those mean.
B00000JCOV|1.0|YES, WELL DONE, YOU MANAGED TO PLAY EVERY INSTRUMENT WRETCHEDLY, just explain y they need 3 drummers, to be frank, 2 of the drummers just stand there hitting things hard! The singer must get his balls wrenched every time he opens his mouth, and i only found out they had some guitar(ists, theres probably about ten round the back playing aswell)  cos I looked at the back of the album, it says:<br />SLIPKNOT:<br />Corey:vocals(aaargh, roooooarr, my balls!!)<br />Mick:guitar(not exactly Jimi Hendrix)<br />Sid:turntables(uh? turntables my a***)<br />Shawn:CUSTOM PERCUSSION!!!!!!(WOT???PRECISELY BASHING THINGS HARD)<br />THEN THERES CHRIS WHO ALSO DOES CUSTOM PERCUSSION.<br />!!!<br />WOTS GOING ON
B000067CPX|3.0|I've never much cared for the Chili Peppers -- in fact, I hold them directly responsible for creating the whole embarrassing &quot;White Boy Metal Funk&quot; genre. That said, I took a chance and bought By the Way last week, and I'm sure glad I did. What surprises me most about this album -- in addition to its mellow, reflective vibe -- is its nearly complete lack of irony: all these songs sound sincere, for lack of a better word (actually, screw it, there isn't a better word: these songs are sincere), and most of them wouldn't sound out of place on late-70s FM radio. And that's a compliment, in case you were wondering....
B000099T2L|4.0|When I think of Beyonce - I think of the one thing... creativity. That's what she has on her solo LP. When I heard it debuted, sitting pretty at #1 (but got knocked off by Ashanti) on the Billboard 200 chart, I've gotta support Beyonce. This album is hot, but there are some factors of what the album needs: more producers (Timbaland, the Neptunes); less sampling and more vocals. The collabos are hot, but what Destiny's Child on this album?<br />These are the songs that I rate:<br />1. \\"Crazy In Love (feat. Jay-)\\" - 10/10 <BR>2. \\"Naughty Girl\\" - 9/10<BR>3. \\"Baby Boy (feat. Sean Paul)\\" - 8/10<BR>4. \\"Hip Hop Star (feat. Big Boi & Sleepy Brown)\\" - 9/10<BR>5. \\"Be With You\\" - 10/10 <BR>6. \\"Me, Myself & I\\" - 9/10<BR>7. \\"Yes\\" - 9/10<BR>8. \\"Signs (feat. Missy Elliott)\\" - 10/10 <BR>9. \\"Speechless\\" - 9/10 <BR>10. \\"That's How You Like It (feat. Jay-Z)\\" - 6/10<BR>11. \\"The Closer I Get To You (duet with Luther Vandross)\\" - 10/10<BR>12. \\"Dangerously In Love 2\\" - 9/10<BR>13. \\"Beyonce Interlude\\" - 4/10<BR>14. \\"Gift From Virgo\\" - 9/10<BR>15. \\"Daddy (Bonus Track)\\" - 9/10<br />Overall, this will be the best R&B album of 2003. I recommend this for any music listener out there who like Beyonce, this is for you. Go, Beyonce!
B000068PQ0|2.0|This record stinks. And that doesn't surprise me, because the Lips have always been a pretty weak band -- an uncomfortable (and artistically false, I should add) mixture of bong-fed ambition and palpable self-consciousness. Although even I have to admit that they've done a fairly good job (up until this fiasco, of course) of, um, rising above (covering up?) their shortcomings in the past -- this is my way of saying that The Soft Bulletin is a pretty cool record. But ...Pink Robots is not. And I think you can safely bet your last roach that their next record won't be great, either. The men behind the curtain have been exposed as giggling entertainers (at best), but not artists.
0385504209|5.0|I mean after all it's an 'Indiana Jones' kind of adventure book in search of the ubiquitous 'Holy Grail' ..... I guess the teaser that the author puts in the front of the book about the fact that the artwork, the existence of secret Cathlic 'societies' is completely real and truthfull, is what may have put some people off .. but please give me a break, IT'S NOT A TEXTBOOK ....<br />The fact that the book is based on reality which is then stretched and artistically massaged by the author makes this book stand out above the norm of today's fiction that usually have disclaimers abaout everything being a lie 'no matter what you want to believe or think you may believe' .....<br />Without getting into the meat of the story I found the book to be easy to read as the author spins tales of secret societies such as Opus Dei, The Templar Knights ... magical hidden treasures and messages hidding in the Louvre, underneath the palace of Herod and thi the top secret vaults of an unpenetrable Swiss Bank with the ever famous anonymous accounts, in Paris.<br />It's such a pleasant relief in a fiction NOVEL of today to actually incite the reader to think and daydream of times past while enjoying a wonderfull well written mystery ......
B00003CY5J|3.0|The movie is entertaining, but due to reasons, other than the performances of its stellar cast: Angela Bassett has just a few and dull moments on the screen. Marlon Brando is helpless with the trite role assigned to him. Though De Niro plays the lead role in this flick, even his performance is limited by the action-oriented role, he plays. The starry-cast fails; but the suspense, the gizmos, and of course, Edward Norton save the day. <br />Edward Norton is full of life, zest, and enthusiasm. The dual role played be him, as a retarded housekeeper and as an adept thief, is pretty convincing and smartly enacted. The gadgets seem like con-jobs, but are however, pretty well-done and detailed. The computer-hacking part and the part about stealing the codes regarding the security system are overdone, and seem factitious and fatuous. The hacker-geek with a baneful mother is a lot more baneful than his squalling mother herself. Amidst of the many imperfections in the movie, it builds up steadily and interestingly to a well-written and well-directed climax. More than anything else, it is the climax of the movie, which makes it complete as an entertaining thriller.<br />With the kind of the star-cast it has, the movie is deceptive: It doesn't have substance, it doesn't have style, and it lacks maturity. If watched with keeping the brain aside to rest, it is thrilling and entertaining, and can be savored at best. Along with its healthful entertaining value, the score itself, of THE SCORE, by Howard Shore is good music for the ears.
0312305060|5.0|This is the story of three women in three different eras, all connected by a book by Virginia Woolf, &quot;Mrs. Dalloway.&quot;  A strange concept for a book, and one that is not conducive to a meaty plot, but Cunningham makes it into a wonderful and lyrical novel.  <br />Emotions are never far from the surface in this book, and the reader can almost experience themselves the suffering and repression that the characters experience.  Truly remarkable is the way in which Cunningham intertwines the lives of his characters, despite their separation by time and space.<br />This book doesn't have a climax necessarily, and it won't shock or scandalize.  But it will make you feel and think, which is the hallmark of a good book.

B00000G3Q4|5.0|And that's saying a lot, because I am a huge fan of zombie movies. &quot;Evil Dead&quot; is the definition of a cult movie. Most don't take the movie seriously, as the special effects aren't very special, and until about halfway through, the acting could definitely be better. But you have to remember that this was made by a group of kids on an extremely tight budget. If you realize that, and watch it with an open mind, you will really get the full effect. Evil Dead II is also very good, although it's definitely more cartoony than the first. Oh, and by the way, to all of you who still think the movie is a horrible waste of time, keep in mind that if this movie had been a miserable failure, then Sam Raimi would never have directed such a good &quot;Spiderman&quot; movie!<br />Hail to the King!<BR>--PumpkinFreak
0385504209|2.0|This is a good beach read but that is about it.  My main problem with it was that I had been lead to believe by the hype that it was intellectual.  As far as I can see, Dan Brown has taken a mis-mash of tired old theories about the power of the Church and symbology and formed them into a pretty good thriller.  There is very little new here in the way of ideas and the writing style is not particularly lyrical (two things that I personally like in novels.)  Umberto Eco has done somewhat the same thing in Foucault's Pendulum and he did it infinitely better.
B00005QHPQ|5.0|This cd is gettin the maximum out of enrique, his cd called escape and it's HOT:<br />1.

B000002C1V|3.0|&quot;The Final Cut&quot; was, for me, a great disappointment.  <BR>I agree with those who label it the first of Waters' solo albums.  The greatest tragedy of this album is that Waters leaves too little space for Gilmour's gorgeous and transcendant guitar solos.  The general tone of the album is harsh and even unpleasant--no doubt the effect that Jolly Roger was hoping to acheive, but nonetheless no fun to listen to.<BR>But my complaint is not merely that this album is not &quot;easy listening.&quot;  &quot;The Final Cut&quot; lacks the musicality that Waters needed to carry his lyrics.  None of the songs have a recognizable melody.  Certain tracks, like &quot;The Gunner's Dream,&quot; have recurring motifs, but nothing that could be called a tune.  Of course, there are many Floyd songs that lack a melody, even masterpieces like Dogs, Welcome to the Machine, Time, Money, and Us and Them.  But these tracks made up for it with lyrical guitar solos and richly textured keyboard backgrounds by Wright.  Both of these key Floydian elements are lacking on The Final Cut; the result is an album that may touch the social conscience through its lyrics but whose music does nothing to touch the soul.<BR>This album proves that Waters' lyrics cannot carry themselves.  At times during &quot;The Final Cut,&quot; Waters gets carried away with metaphor, and much of his imagery is heavyhanded, lacking the simiple mystical elegance of his lyrics for &quot;Animals,&quot; &quot;Dark Side of the Moon,&quot; &quot;Wish You Were Here,&quot; or &quot;Meddle&quot; -  the group's finest albums.  Furthermore, Waters' singing voice on this album is grating, and so exposed that often he is blatantly off key.<BR>In their most productive and successful years, Waters carried the group, both lyrically and conceptually.  In the end however, his last Floyd effort is a failure.  I've heard this album praised for its &quot;rawness of feeling.&quot;  Raw it is.  Floyd it is not.
6305232660|2.0|Maybe this is a good movie, but just not my style.  I did like Armegedon.  The plot of the movie was that the US found out that in 2 years and asteroid will strike Earth.  The main problem with this movie is that it doesn't focus on the asteroid as much as it should.  I would bet more that half of this movie had nothing to do with the asteroid.  During this time, the movie focusses on the personal lives of the characters of the movie which really isn't that interesting.  When the method of destroying the asteroid is discussed, it seems that it was thought up and planned by a 6th grade class.  Also, I didn't find the way everyone reacted mostly acurate.  So overall, if you have nothing better to do, you could rent this movie.  But if you want to see a great movie about an asteroid, see Armegedon.
0688170528|4.0|I read this book over three days.  From the first page, I was into it and found it hard to put down.  There are issues that come up in the book that seem unimportant or insignificant at the time, however they come back later and the reader can see how profoundly they affected the characters.<br />For the most part the book was believable, as it looked at the various ways that people handle grief.  It's interesting to see how detailed the process becomes for some of the characters.<br />Overall, a great book and an easy, quick read!  It even leaves you with a little to think about when the last page has been read.
0767817478|4.0|This movie has great special effects (a thing I really enjoy), and a good storyline.  For those who don't know the storyline, it's basically starts of with a nuclear bomb testing.  Eventually the US army finds traces of a giant creature, then Godzilla shows up one day in New York to wreak havoc.  The find out that nuclear testings made a lizzard grow really really big into Godzilla.  From here, the army tries to catch it (using more really good special effects), but many problems make this a lot harder than they thought it would be.  Overall, I think this move is  most definitely worth seeing (preferably on a rainy day).
B00009V7T2|5.0|These guys are tremendous.....What can I say .....It's completely different....and better than any thing I've heard this year....Buy this album for a mind altering experience of music.
B000089RVX|5.0|I purchased this album a little hesitantly. I kind of liked &quot;Bring Me to Life,&quot; but I didn't feel it was such a fabulous song. Still, the CD stared at me from the shelves every time I passed by, so I finally decided that if it was going to haunt me so much I may as well pick it up. Turned out to be the best musical decision I've made in the last 10 years. Each song has its own quality that makes it worthwhile.<BR>&quot;Going Under&quot; - Starts to sound a little like Pink, but she has got a great voice as well, so no harm there. <BR>&quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; - I really like the way she sounds next to Paul. They should consider releasing more songs together.<BR>&quot;Everybody's Fool&quot; - The lyrics are so true to life.<BR>&quot;My Immortal&quot; - This is by far my favorite song on the album.The lyrics are amazing, and Amy's voice expresses the incredible pain one feels in such a situation.<BR>&quot;Haunted&quot; - Exactly as it sounds. The guitar rocks though.<BR>&quot;Tourniquet&quot; - This is totally a Christian song. Beautiful and full of angst.<BR>&quot;Imaginary&quot; - This one sounds like a lot of the other songs combined into one. Not my fave, but good in its own right.<BR>&quot;Taking Over Me&quot; - Pretty good song. <BR>&quot;Hello&quot; - This is probably my least favorite song on the album. Just strange and depressing.<BR>&quot;My Last Breath&quot; - This song has everything....beautiful vocals, rockin riffs, desperate lyrics. Amy's song about a girl holding onto her last breath so she doesn't have to leave her love is painfully heartwrenching.<BR>&quot;Whisper&quot; - The choir is such an interesting way to end this album. The chorus will stick though, and it may pop into your head in the most unlikely and inappropriate of places.<br />All in all, an awesome album. I can't wait until their next album is released.
B0000640VO|5.0|This is my German girlfriend's favorite movie. She introduced it to me last year and I think it's great as well. I'm a big fan of Delicatessen and The City of Lost Children by Jean-Pierre Jeunet &amp; Marc Caro as well, Whatever happened to Marc Caro anyhow? Check out those DVD's if you get the chance. Hopefully their other movies will show up on DVD as well.<br />Audrey Tautou as Amélie Poulain s a severe cutie-pie and Mathieu Kassovitz as Nino Quincampoixi is fantastic.<br />My girlfriend took me to Montmartre in Paris a couple of years ago and it's even more beautiful in person than it is in the movie.
0679879269|5.0|This book is amazing and twice as good as any harry potter book.  The tons of plot twists and wonderful characters bring this book to life.  It's much more intense and detailed than most other fantasy books I've read. The ending brought me to tears.  I recommend it for older readers, probably above 12.  You won't be disappointed!
B00006J3T4|5.0|Mark Knopfler doesn't really do rock and roll anymore.  His last two CDs have been hard to define, skirting along the edges of folk, blues and country with a dash of jazz.  The results have been sublime.  On Ragpicker's Dream, Knopfler abandons his rock history entirely, and this is not a bad thing.  His voice has matured into a smoky rumble which fits his laid back style completely.  The guitar is less of a centerpiece than a complement, and you can just see him in the studio, eyes closed, picking and strumming as if there was nothing else in the world worth doing.  He has lost none of his skill at creating pictures with lyrics, and songs such as \\"Devil Baby\\" and \\"Coyote\\" are perfect illustrations.  On the latter, you can even hear him winking at you with a crooked smile.  \\"Hill Farmer's Blues\\" could have been written in the '30's, and stands up to the best of that period.  \\"A Place Where We Used to Live\\" almost makes me cry each time I hear it.<BR>Knopfler has a good grasp of cultural influences, and peppers his songs with references that you wouldn't expect from a British musician.  The highlight of his last album was the title cut with James Taylor, which is lifted directly from Tom Pynchon's novel \\"Mason & Dixon.\\"  This album seems to capture the guarded optimism, the dragging resignation and the wistful yearning of a people and a time when such things were more a way of life.  More importantly, he seems to make these feelings relevant to today, with an unstable economy, nameless fears and uncertain future slowly invading the cultural consciousness once again.  How ironic that in this masterful collection, we realize that the most poignant and insightful observer of America doesn't even live there.<BR>While I miss the fine guitar work of the Dire Straits days, this is sweet and satisfying as well.  Knopfler is a most remarkable musician in an age when musicianship is underrepresented in popular music.  In my mind, few stand with him:  Van Morrison, Warren Zevon, Elvis Costello.  Get this album.  Get everything he's ever done.  Encourage him to do more.  You'll be doing me a favor as well as yourself.
0385509456|5.0|With great skill the author puts you in the shoes of Christopher,  a relatively high-functioning autistic teenager.  Yet, while seeing the world through his eyes, you also see the things which he cannot.  You see both fear and compassion in the faces of neighbors when Christopher cannot.  You see a father and mother that desperately love their child but they are drowning like would-be lifeguards pulled under by the boy they are trying to save.  And you see courage as Christopher undertakes an impossible journey proving that hardship and necessity are often required to bring out the best in all of us.
B0000399WI|5.0|This is one of the funniest movies i've ever seen!  I especially liked the part where the warden finds out the bible carried Andy's escape tool.  I couldn't stop laughing!  It's not quite as good as Con Air but it is very entertaining.<br />The only part of the movie that seemed far-fetched, was the part where Andy plays the record with the Italian ladies singing.  Come on!  He should have played Elvis or something like that.  I mean, hardened convicts listening to opera music and liking it?  Yeah, right.  They would sooner tap spoons on their cell bars than hear that noise.<br />Still, a good movie.  Ranks right up there with Escape from L.A.  This one could be a keeper.  Yeah, man!  Gotta go.  Surf's up!
B000083E79|5.0|I've been a fan since I was a kid in the 70's and she has never disappointed.  This is the first full length CD I've purchased new and it did not disappoint.  Listening to a lot of the songs brought back lots of great memories of my growing up.  &quot;Take Me Home&quot; actually made me giggle with delight.  I could almost see the disco ball on the ceiling.<br />Cher is an icon of the best kind.  She lives life on her own terms, gets up and dusts herself off after every fall, and just keeps on being true to herself no matter what others think.  This is why her true fans have stuck with her for nearly five decades. This CD rocks and I anticipate playing it, literally, to death and never growing tired of hearing girlfriend tell it like it is.
6305508550|5.0|....and why are you wearing only the minimum pieces of flair?<br />This is a delightful comedy about the annoyances and indignities of the modern workaday world, as seen through the eyes of Peter, a cube-dwelling software developer, and his prospective girlfriend, a frustrated waitress at Chachki's restaurant where over-eager teenagers (\\"try the EXTREME fajitas\\") take your order. <br />Although seemingly aimed at Gen-Xers, Office Space resonates with us older folks too. The characters and situations are hilarious, the dialogue wittily unexpected (\\"during these conjugal visits.... can you have sex with a woman?\\"), and the only people who seem content with life are those who don't do too much thinking--like Peter's neighbor, a happy-go-lucky construction worker whose sole concerns are naked women and beer. <br />If you don't enjoy this movie, it's either because you lack a sense of humor or else you didn't get the memo.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I own the extended addition of the Fellowship of the Ring and have completely enjoyed it. In my opinion extended edition is the only real version of the movie and the theater version is just a preview to the extended addition. I feel the same way about the Two Towers, I loved it in the theater and I can't wait for the extended addition. When the theater version comes out in late August I may rent it a couple of times, however in my opinion the real release date isn't until November 18th.

0312305060|5.0|I bought this book the moment I saw it, and even though later I thought I might regret it, that never happened.<BR>I was astonished by how Michael Cunningham managed to penetrate so deeply into the persoonalities of every character. One could call him a &quot;brave author&quot; referring to his ability to reveal thoughts and truisms that secretly absorb most people. But he also manages to create complete and interesting characters who embody these thoughts.<BR>Cunningham illuminates every moment of a seemingly casual day in each character's life, and makes the reader see how important it all is, how these tiny detailsare essential pieces of life.<BR>Through these details emerges a gripping and vivid plot that makes this book so absorbing.<BR>I enjoyed all three parts equally, and I thought that the part about Clarissa Vaughan really wasn't a cover of &quot;Mrs.Dalloway&quot;<BR>The part about Laura Brown was a brilliant depiction of the claustrophobia in a seemingly perfect life, while the part about Virginia Woolf exceeded expectations.<BR>The only fault I found was that we didn't really see why &quot;Mrs.Dallloway&quot; affected Laura so much, in my opinion.<BR>I really loved this book, and also thought the movie was excellent and it made me love the book even more!
B00005YXZH|5.0|This is one of the best albums I own.  I rate it right up there with Radiohead's The Bends, PJ Harvey's To Bring You My Love, and Mansun's Six as one of best albums of my lifetime.

B00005JM1F|3.0|Ok, so maybe it's not \\"Animal House\\", but in a time of silly teen comedies, \\"Old School\\" delivers exactly what you can imply from the title. Also, it's just another excuse to watch Will Ferrell (one of the funniest guys alive in my opinion) doing what he does best: make us laugh until we fall from our seats. Also, this Unrated version is the one you want to have, where they make sure not to hold back any punches. And did I mention that, for a change, the special features [aren't bad]?<br />The plot is the least important thing. Actually, it's very formulaic: Luke Wilson's character buys a house on campus territory and lets his crazy friends (played by Vince Vaughn and Will Ferrell) to make a giant monster of a party. It's so wild, that the next day he is kicked off the University grounds by the Dean (played by Jeremy Piven, who does the complete opposite of his character in \\"PCU\\"). So the three friends have only one solution: start a fraternity. From then on, you know the drill. They have to overcome all obstacles and beat the system that's trying to bring them down.<br />The movie is also a wonderful parody of \\"Fight Club\\", not only because of key scenes involving the recruiting of new frat members, but also because it carries the same load of self-destruction, especially regarding the character of Will Ferrell: Frank the Tank, a guy who realizes he doesn't want to live the life of a married man and returns to the life he used to have in college, mainly becoming a sloppy drunk. You can see also lots of cameo appearances, like 24's Elisha Cuthbert, Juliette Lewis, Sean William Scott and Snoop Dog. The humor in this film is very 80's, but it doesn't come close to the stupidity of teen films like \\"American Pie\\", \\"Not Another Teen movie\\" or \\"Just Married\\". This one is made by proffesionals, and you can see that.<br />Now, for the edition, I think the best thing is the Inside the Actors Studio spoof. I would buy the DVD for this feature alone! You know from SNL that Will Ferrell does a great impersonation of James Lipton, and here he does a 20-minute piece in which Lipton interviews him and the rest of the cast. The fact that no one is laughing and the interview has a \\"serious\\" tone makes it even funnier! Just watch it and you'll pass out laughing. I know I did. The other features are ok, but this is the one to check out.<br />So, in conclusion, \\"Old School\\" may not be the best comedy around, but it makes a sincere effort in avoiding the cliches of today's comedies and return to hard-core stuff with great, experienced comedians. For all fans of will Ferrell is a must see, but if you want the best college comedies, you're better off getting \\"Animal House\\". This one I'd recommend to rent and then you'll see for yourself.ll Ferrell does a great impersonation of James Lipton, and here he does a 20-minute piece in which Lipton interviews him and the rest of the cast. The fact that no one is laughing and the interview has a \\"serious\\" tone makes it even funnier! Just watch it and you'll pass out laughing. I know I did.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is on the 12th episode in the UK at the moment.  Only one more to go sob!  Fox didn't let the rest of the world have a say before cancelling the finest entertainment I have ever seen.  I am looking forward to the DVD as the tension in Firefly is ruined by our Sci-Fi channel placing adverts in the middle of conversations.  Every single character is rich.  They work brialliantly together as a team.  I have not been drawn to any series as quickly as I was attached to Firefly.  Thank goodness for the DVD and hopefully a film.  Although it is unlikely to continue being made after the movie is the massive hit I know it will be, I will keep my fingers crossed.  Stranger things have happened.  They must hurry to sign up the cast though, as the loss of any one of them would be devastating.  Buy this DVD, you will only regret that it is not a full series, but worth watching in spite of that.  Come and join the rest of us in gnashing our teeth at the futility of expecting intelligence in corporate studios.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Melodic organization of deep bass beats and innovative musical arrangements that drop you into an abyssal trance of dark mood.  Soothing and heartfelt, yet depressing lyrics and vocalizations that tear into your mind and induce tears with their vivid display of emotion pain and fury.  <br />The songs seem to reach in and pull you out to embark on their journey of creativity and realization of the pain of life.  This is by far the most dramatic and glorious album Radiohead has every produced.  It contains the most brilliant and risk-taking songs that are deserving of praise.  They did not falter under the influence of modern pop and rock and managed to be daring enough to adjust their style.  <br />From the mediocre and substandard album The Bends, and grew ever since Ok, Computer, and Kid A Amnesiac takes you to the deepest areas of your mind and makes you feel every riff.  From the trip-hop like beats and moribund lyrics of The Pyramid Song, to the frustration and outcries of You and Whos Army, to the ambient and seemingly lost hope of The Morning Bells.  Nearly every song is excellent.  <br />This is not at all a positive album, but that is what makes it all the more beautiful.  That is what makes Radiohead the best rock group to date.  Their willing to be daring enough to stray from the normal, and to invent wonderful music free of cliches and mediocrity, packed ful of deep poetry, that is dramatic and mind wrenching.  That is what music is suppose to do, be meaningful.
0671004107|5.0|Contact is a story about how could be the first contact of humans with other intelligent beings in the universe. Although this is a very old theme, it is an entirely different book. As an astronomer, the author tried to be very realistic what yielded a story where everything is tied and where you will not find any contradictions. You will not only enjoy a very good and beautiful tale, but also will have a &quot;contact&quot; with real scientific worries and concepts related to the search of intelligent life in other planets. The book also touch in the conflicts between religion and science mixed inside all the story in a very balanced way: you would expect that Carl would only support the rational side in the book, but when you read, you will be awed and surprised (and will respect Carl still more).<br />For those who saw the movie (that is an excellent movie, my favourite), the book has less untied knots, everything is clarified and has an end that the film has not. The end chapter of the book make you end your reading with a smile in your face.<br />One final note, when Carl was researching to write the book, he contacted Kip Thorne to ask him about the possibility of interestellar travels through black holes. Inspired by Carl's question, Thorne developed the real physics concepts of travel through wornholes and, later, timetravel through them.<br />If you like science fiction and science, read this book. Certainly this will be one of your favourites, if not the favourite itself.
B00004XONN|3.0|This album has much in common with Amnesiac. Though it is as if it is an unfinished version of Amnesiac. I don't understand why many people think it is better than Amnesiac, because I don't see why. It doesn't have much to it, except some music backrounds simular to Amnesiac. I can bearly remember any song s on it, because they just fade into the sounds of a silent room.  The songs are substanless, and bland.  It is more like an instrumental album, which is why it got 3 stars instead of 2.  The music is beautiful.  The Morning Bell song on this album is not as good as the one on Amnesiac, either. This album plays out like blueprints of Amnesiac, or some sketches of it, and is only unfinished and not as organized or flawless. I strongly recommend buying Amnesiac over this one, it is lyrically, vocally, and musically superior to Kid A. It is still good though, just a slightly disapointing when compared to Amnesiac.

0679735909|1.0|After devouring Colleen McCullough's wonderful Masters of Rome series, I was looking for something light, like romance. &quot;Possession&quot; seemed promising: forbidden love. And winner of Booker Prize.<br />I was wrong. It was pure torture. But unlike one of the reviewers here, I managed to finished it, but not without difficulties.<br />While struggling to read this, Dorothy Parker came to mind. She once said: &quot;This is not a novel to be tossed aside lightly. It should be thrown with great force.&quot;<br />            <BR>I have tried to like this book, I really have.
B000066NW0|1.0|While I do not claim to be an expert on punk (I listen to bands like NOFX, Rancid, The Descendents, Bad Religion, Social Distortion, Nirvana, Suicide Machines, Guttermouth, Pennywise, old Offspring, H2O, Face to Face, AFI, AntiFlag, Zebrahead and more), I know that Avril Lavigne is the biggest poser around. The only reason that Avril is famous is because of her looks (I admit, she is really hot). Bands like sum 41 and blink 182 are more punk than she is. She talks about how she used to ditch school so she could skateboard. Well wow! If thats all that makes you punk then half the country would be punk. She wears &quot;punky&quot; clothes...which happen to be bought at Old Navy. Her attitude is completely manufactured by the record label. Its hard to believe her songs about growing up considering they were written by someone else. She has absolutely no guitar playing talent so its laughable how she's always posing with a guitar in magazines and music videos. Her primary audience is prepubescent girls who will listen to any music that the record labels tell them is cool. Right now, punk is the &quot;in&quot; thing. Record labels sell prepackaged, &quot;safe&quot; acts like Good Charlotte and Avril Lavigne. The difference between these bands is that Good Charlotte at least writes their songs and actually plays their instruments.  Every time I see Avril on tv I want to throw up. How can someone with no talent in songwriting, guitar playing, and singing be so famous and admired. Personally, I am a guitar player who is a better songwriter, player and singer. Why am I not famous?
B00008OWZC|1.0|\\"How the West Was Won\\" successfully captures the sound and fury  of a band chock full of virtuosos who are, basically, having a whale of a good time; that in itself is quite an achievement for a live album.  Not many bands, regardless of how great their STUDIO albums sound, can truly BRING IT on a live recording.  And with the exception of a couple bootlegs I've heard over the years, I thought the same of Led Zeppelin...that is, until I heard \\"How the West Was Won\\".  <br />This is Zeppelin at its blues-on-steroids best.  It absolutely BLOWS AWAY Zepp's previous, and sadly mediocre live effort, \\"The Song Remains the Same\\", much of which was clogged with  pretentious filler, Robert Plant's shreiking and guitar whiz Jimmy Page's self-indulgent noodlings.  <br />\\"How the West Was Won\\" absolutely ROCKS!  Zepp sounds like a kick butt bar band-maybe this is how they sounded in their pre-superstar Birmingham pub rocker days.  Jimmy Page and John Bonham have NEVER sounded  better; this album affirms what I knew all along-that John Bonham not only played HEAVY, he possessed the touch and subtlety befitting the greatest rock drummer who ever banged the skins-a master craftsman.  Robert \\"Old Crisco Lungs\\" Plant misses some high notes in \\"The Immigrant Song\\", but overall is pretty solid, and comes up with some new (to my ears at least) and interesting phrasing.  \\"Bring It On Home\\" is a CLASSIC heavy blues bash-the rhythm section-Bonham and bassist John Paul Jones-churn like a locomotive while Page throws off bone-rattling and steaming chunks of power chord.  \\"Moby Dick\\" is Moby Dick-pure excess with Bonham's extended soloing, but when the entire band plays, the rhythm is as good, or better than anything that was EVER considered \\"Heavy\\"-Zepp is MOLTEN.  Whole Lotta Love is a bit excessive in its extended jams and Plant's call-and-response improvising, and it could have been edited down from 25:00+, but then again, doing that would have drained the rawness out of the song, and Zepp still manages, on the entire album, to sound RAW even as they were becoming slick professionals.   <br />The heavy blues-based tunes such as \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\", \\"Bring It On Home\\" and \\"Heartbreaker\\" are stand outs, and even the all-acoustic \\"Going to California\\" is much better live; generally I can't even tolerate that tune.  The three tunes on this album from the \\"Houses of the Holy\\" album (their latest, I think, at the time HTWWW was recorded)-\\"Over the Hills and Far Away\\", \\"The Ocean\\" and \\"Dancing Days\\"-never stuck me as good, rocking candidates for live performance-boy was I wrong.  All three songs sound incredible live.  And Stairway To Heaven?  I wasn't bored listening to the live version, because it sounds like a much different and better version of the radio/studio \\"Anthem\\" that your average 70's-AOR-raised pup has heard over 17,800 times by the time he's reached the age of 35.  <br />Page's leads and fills sound absolutely marvelous throughout the live performances that comprise \\"How the West Was Won\\"; he takes chances, displays some heretofore unimagined whimsy (e.g. in the middle of a solo, breaking into Jethro Tull's instrumental \\"Bouree\\"), and just, simply, SOARS.  This is far from the self-absorbed, 350-notes-per-second technocrat portrayed in the film version of \\"The Song Remains the Same\\".   <br />\\"How the West Was Won\\" sucessfuly manages to capture a magical moment in time when Zep had reached the absolute pinnacle of its  musical powers, but it was early enough-1972-that the band STILL genuinely loved playing for the sheer joy of it and may not have totally bought into the \\"Rock God\\" hype.  Once the Rock God personas DID kick-in, a year or less later, Zepp quickly reached dinosaur status-joke fodder for Spinal Tap and a symbol of punk rocker contempt.  \\"How the West Was Won\\" is Zepp as it should be remembered.  I only wish I had the opportunity to see them at this stage of their career.  If you like rock music, buy this album-it personifies ROCK.
B000000W8C|5.0|This album attains a level of perfection few bands ever achieve.  Everything is perfect, from construction of individual songs to the over-arcing concept of the record as a whole.  Intense, beautiful, frightening, mesmerizing: absolutely superlative.  Best part of the album: the two psychadelic jams (&quot;Brainstorm Interlude&quot; and &quot;Reprise&quot;) that end each half.  And has a guitar ever sounded as simultaneously visceral and spacy as Nick McCabe's?  Awesome.
0385504209|5.0|The DaVinci Code has disfunctional families, murder, suspense, Ludlum-like characters and a great story.  It was a worthwhile read that sent me to the internet to research &quot;The Last Supper&quot; and a few secret societies.  It's hard to get the ending to a book about the Holy Grail just right in fiction, but Dan Brown completed the DaVinci Code with the perfect ending.

0679411585|5.0|&quot;This story is about time and memories. The time was 1965, a different kind of year, a year where one era was ending in America and another was beginning...&quot; And so begins the increadible acount of the battle of the Ia Drang Valley written by the man who was there through it all. I thought this was a wonderful book about what war is like on both sides: the soldiers and their families. I would often find myself imagining the scenes that were so detailed, I could literally almost smell it! I kid you not! If you liked the movie, then you'll defenatly love the book! I'm not an emotional person, but I found myself almost crying over the words written on the page, they were so intense and beautiful! A must read book!

B00008V5VN|4.0|To clear the smoke from the previous review...<br />The differences are as follows:<BR>1.  Its live.  Yeah, live.  No Overdubs.  <BR>2.  This is the band's original mix with Billy Anderson, not the major labels cleaned up version. (edited with overdubs and a new producer because the first one was so anti commercial)<BR>3. You won't be able to tell the total difference in production on your factory car stereo, home stereo, shower stereo, pocket radio...you get the picture.  You need a REAL stereo.<BR>4.  The differences are in the low end.  Low, low end.  And vocals.  And the overall sparkle and shine as compared to Jerusalem.<BR>4.The artwork: Arik &quot;Moonhawk&quot; Roper.  Notice the lack of information on the spine so as to not break up the continuity of the artwork from front to back.<BR>5.  Vinyl.  This is on beautiful double gatefold vinyl.<BR>6.  Sonic Titan.
B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay has created another awesome CD.  With only 11 songs, its like having more.  With some CDs you tend to skip over a few tracks, but with this one all 11 songs are well worth listening to.  I bought Rush of Blood to the Head only having heard Scientist and Clocks, but all nine other songs are great. I didnt think that they could top their previously released Parachutes, but this album proves me wrong.  From Politik to Scientist, from Clocks to We Never Change, the heavier songs are contrasted by the slow melodies.  This CD is awesome and I really recomend it.
B00005JLTN|4.0|I give The Matrix Reloaded four stars for brilliant special effects, great characters and a good storyline, even though some of the mystery was taken away. The Wachowski brothers must have done some serious brainstorming to figure out how to top The Matrix. They didn't top it, but they delivered a satisfactory sequel.<BR>Unlike a lot of other reviewers here, I loved the fight scenes, even the long skirmish between Neo and Agent Smith. They kept upping the ante, testing each other's limits. They don't seem to have found any yet, but they have a measure of each other. It gives us a good foretaste of their own personal armageddon.<BR>The biggest problems for me were the scenes of Zion. It was partly what I imagined, and then a whole lot of what I didn't imagine. Aside from taking away the mystery of the last refuge of humanity, the Wachowskis added some quite ludicrous scenes to the mythology. The pointed effort to make Zion a PC melting pot was one of them. Do Neo, Morpheus, etc. go out of their way to free a representative number of races???<BR>The other unnecessary thing in the Zion scenes was the religious service. Granted, there already was a philosophical/religious theme in the Matrix that contributed to its appeal, but the orgy-like dance party was just silly. It looked like an ecstasy-fueled rave, or an ancient pagan worship rite. Like a fellow viewer commented, it made me feel these are not people worth saving, let the machines have 'em!<BR>Fortunately, the directors redeemed the rest of the movie with continuing good action, some great new characters (the programs, not the humans) and further mind-blowing revelations in the dialogue with the Architect. Looking forward to a smashing finish.
B000007T2Z|5.0|If you haven't heard of Godspeed You Black Emporer, that's okay, because a lot of people haven't.  But don't make the mistake of judging this by the weird band title, or weird album title.  Actually, in a way it fits the music perfectly, because this is a beauty not easily described or captured.  You must have some patience, but not much, because the first track will grab you and hold you until the last throbs of sonic texture fade out on Providence, the climactic third and final track.  With street preachers screaming about the end of the world and such, one would get the impression that these guys are entrenched in depression, but the beauty of the guitar solos and stretched out rhythms shows that they understand the essence joi-de-vivre: hitting that special place during the crescendos that only a long, slow buildup can bring you to, and cannot be simply achieved with a catchy guitar riff in a 2 1/2 minute song.  The only other type of music which can do this is classical, you know, with the orchestra and stuff.<br />People have tried to mix classical and rock music for decades, and the result is usually a blatant compromise between the two styles, leaning more in one direction.  Godspeed is different.  They create, on this three song masterpiece, what I would picture grandchildren listening to in the year 2100 and wondering why nobody composes music with such beauty and grace anymore, much like classical buffs do today.  Buy this and you WILL be thankful.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I have been waiting a long time for some new MUSIC to come out.  Music, meaning someone with talent and passion, who can touch the lives of others while also educating them on how its supposed to be done.  Gavin Degraw is one of the most talented artists I've heard for some time.  He has such a soulfull voice, and can really rock it on the piano.  Not only is this album amazing, but I've seen him perform live and my breath was taken away.  His love and passion for music is contagious, and I can only hope that he is exposed enough for everyone to enjoy, and for him to reap the well deserved benefits.  I recommend buying this album right away because if you don't have it, you're missing out on something truly special!
B000000WJZ|5.0|One of the best alternative rock albums of all time, along with The Real Thing (Faith No More) and The Downward Spiral (Nine Inch Nails). The trouble is, these albums are SO good, they are almost impossible to follow. <br />I challenge anyone to find an album that rocks more than this, that is more emotional than this, that makes you feel as good as this, that you gan get drunk to, stoned to, ***k to and cry to.<br />Go on.<br />Can't can you!!
B00003CXA6|1.0|I can't belive that some of these reveiwers were watching the same movie that I saw.  This movie was OK with history, but too many vorbose monologes for me.  Everyone was going on and on with long speeches which told a lot but were way to boring.  Martin Sheen was a terrible Robert E. Lee.  His acent was not belivable at all, he sounded more like he was from South Boston rather than Virginia.  And what was with his hat?  Wasn't he carrying it most of the movie?  Did they pay someone a lot to do his hair and that is why he almost never wore it?  I am a big Civil War person and have a great interest in the time but this movie was soo long that I thought I actually spent the 3 days the battle took.  I would have given it a 1 except the history was fairly close to the way it was.
B00009MGQL|1.0|There is no doubt that Jeff Beck ranks up there...way up there.<BR>However, lately his records are not something one can relate to.<BR>Why are his records now featuring electronica?. <BR>Another thing, he is too much of a recluse.And in addition, pays too much attention on false looks. Come on, no man nearing 60 has that much hair, not even Mick Jagger. Yes people, he is wearing a wig. Like Nigel Tufnel. I prefer his days with Rod Stewart and Ron Wood.
B00003CY0V|2.0|This is an extremely bad movie. The only saving grace is the special effects, and for that there are many other movies around. Beats me why talented professionals like Halle Berry and John Travolta agreed to do this nonsense. Berry doesn't do much except take off her clothes at every available opportunity.  It's a bad rehash of Dog Day Afternoon, with a plot line so unbelievable that one wonders how the actors found their way through it - and then one realises they didn't. A total waste of time.
B00009ATIX|4.0|Although far from a perfect film, the American version of Solaris benefits from the brevity (90 minutes)and focus of the story (adapted from both the original novel by Stanislaw Lem and Andrew Tarkovsey's classic 70's film). Solaris appears to divide people just about as evenly as both the first film version did and Kubrick's 2001 when it was first released.<br />Solaris appears to be alive. The star around which a huge space station orbits intrudes on the occupants' dreams making what they dream a reality. Why? Is there some sinister purpose or is it an attempt to communicate? Perhaps Solaris is nothing more than an idiot savant playing on the imagination of the astronauts trapped on an endless merry-go-round to hell. Or not.<br />Based on Stanislaw Lem's fascinating novel and echoing the Russian film adaption by the talented Andrei Tarkovsky , Solaris is part dream and reality. George Clooney plays psychologist Chris Kelvin who is sent on a mission to the orbiting space station. His mission is to determine if the astronauts on the Prometheus have gone mad or, perhaps, if some sort of covert attempt at first contact his occurring. When Kelvin arrives he finds one scientist has committed suicide while another has barracaded herself in her room. Clearly something is at work. The only questions are why and what its motivation might possibly be. Kelvin awakens after his first day on the space station and discovers his wife is with him. Which is impossible as she committed suicide.<br />The film, like its Russian counterpart, is designed to unfold gradually with each layer discovered as you watch. The narrative thread that holds the film together appears to be stretched quite thin by the end of the film. None of the central questions are truly answered. Then again, these very qualities make the film interesting. There aren't supposed to be any definitive answers provided. In many respects, Solaris has more in common with Kubrick's 2001. In the novel by Arthur C. Clarke (like Lem's novel Solaris)there are more answers to the puzzle. Kubrick wanted to keep cold, hard answers to a minimum. That's also the case with Soderbergh's film. We live in a tradional world where we expect all answers to be handed out on a silver platter. Many of the best films play with that convention. If you expect answers to the many layered riddles in this fine film, you'll be sadly disappointed. I do take issue with the interpretation of the ending as a &quot;happy&quot; ending; it's no more a happy ending than the perplexing, difficult and complex ending of 2001. In many respects, Kelvin is in as much of a cage as Bowman is in 2001. It's a cage of his own choosing but he has chosen to live in an illusion vs. the real world he left behind. There's a great deal of tragedy to that decision.<br />Clooney and the rest of the small ensemble cast gives terrific performances. I was pleasantly surprised at Clooney's ability to convey the haunted, hurt quality at the core of Kelvin. Directed and written for the screen by the talented Steven Soderbergh, Solaris, like Tarkovsky 's first adaption, is a quiet, unsettling film that bathes itself in Lem's rich metaphors and analogies. While it lacks the glacial pace of Tarkovsky 's original film, the narrative doesn't occur at a breakneck pace either. Recalling both Kubrick's cold 2001: A Space Odyssey and Truffaut's distant Farenheit 451.<br />Interestingly, Soderbergh's film has much of the passion missing from these works of the 60's. It's interesting because, despite its snail like pace, the first film was written and directed in reaction to Kubrick's 2001. Tarkovsky hated the the anonymity of Kubrick's characters and the fact that HAL the computer had more passion, more humanity and, ultimately, more flaws than its creators. So while Soderbergh's film references these other films, it also reflects the very qualities missing from Kubrick's clinical 2001.<br />The DVD transfer is very good. I didn't notice any edge enhancements which have marred many of the films that Fox has put out on DVD. The sound is top notch as well. The extras are sparse; there' the original screenplay available in still mode; an HBO special about the making of the film which is interesting although hardly essential; the films original trailers (both of which are quite vivid and imaginative) and a commentary by Soderbergh that provides an interesting insight into the process of film direction.<br />Solaris deals many of the same themes as Kubrick, Truffaut and other neophyte science fiction directors; it's ultimately about our humanity and the very qualities that make us unique. It's also about the loss of our emotional self at the hands of technology and personal loss. Soderbergh's film is a complimentary piece to the Tarkovsky masterpiece (which can be admittedly difficult to sit through) from the early 70's. Soderbergh asks many more questions than he answers and that's how it should be in great literature, films and plays. Ultimately, the value of any art form is the not just in the questions it asks but in those it chooses not to answer.hancements which have marred many of the films that Fox has put out on DVD.

B000001DYA|3.0|Nadie duda la importancia histórica de este disco, que supera en intensidad a lo que estaba haciendo por entonces Hendrix o Cream (estos ultimos en vivo supongo, ya que Disraeli Gears no es el mejor punto de comparación). Viene entonces el tema de quién inventó el hard rock y muchos citan a Vincebus Eruptum como el punto de partida. Respecto a eso me parece muy arriesgado darle crédito a un sólo grupo como inventor de un género, pero es cierto, antes de Iron Butterfly, MC5, Stooges o Led Zeppelin ya Blue Cheer estaba haciendo lo que se conoce como heavy, no eran los únicos ni los mejores pero si los más salvajes, usando mucha distorsión, no mucha técnica, potente batería y pesado bajo, voz estridente, etc.<br />Dejando claro este punto y concentrándose exclusivamente en la música, temas como Doctor Please y en especial Second Time Around son verdaderos monumentos del sonido heavy de fines de los 60's y que inspirarían a cientos de otras bandas. Lejos de ser virtuosos, Blue Cheer era pura energía y a diferencia de sus competidores no hay espacio aquí para inventos sicodélicos o aventuras similares, lo importante es destrozar la melodía y hacerla ruido (Summertime Blues es el perfecto ejemplo). Vincebus Eruptum es media hora de eso, dejando muy claro que para traspasar fronteras no hay que ser genios sino simplemente hacer todo lo posible dentro de los cada vez menos claros límites musicales de esa extraordinaria época de cambios.
B000069AUI|5.0|The follow-up to the stunningly and surprisingly successful Parachutes, A Rush Of Blood To The Head is a much more confident record. Most of its eleven tracks are knockouts. The first of these is the lead track, 'Politik', which asserts the band's purpose this time around. The music reflects the urgency of the lyrical message, with intense guitars and drums crashing on every beat, all held up by Chris Martin's piano playing, which adds a distinct element of drama and emotion to the song. <br />Following 'Politik' comes the record's first single, 'In My Place'.  The simple, uplifting guitars and vocal harmonies make it hard to listen to this song and come away not feeling good.<br />The intensity returns with 'God Put A Smile Upon Your Face', with Will Champion's snare drum present on every beat. The song introduces a habit of Coldplay's - combining electric and acoustic guitars in the same song, yet keeping the electric guitar to a minimum. In such situations for Coldplay, the acoustic guitar always seems to take precedence over the electric. <br />The second and forthcoming single is 'The Scientist'. Again built on soft piano, it is a song containing an ideal mix of piano, guitars, and drums, with just enough strings to make it emotionally appealing without going over the top. <br />Opening with a beautiful piano riff, and where Champion's percussion line is again rhythmically varied, 'Clocks' is a song that truly showcases Chris Martin's vocal abilities. The addition of harmonies with backing vocalist Champion is a powerful addition. While most Coldplay songs are built around a piano, 'Clocks' is set apart because of how prominent and aggressive the role of the piano is. <br />The final song, 'Amsterdam', is easily the class of the record. The musical arrangement of the song is practically flawless; it opens with only Martin's vocals and piano. As the song moves along, the pace picks up, the piano melody gets more intense, and drums and guitars come in, adding anintensity not seen on the rest of the record. The song contains the most intense and the most relaxed moments of the record all in one; the juxtaposition of the two extremes makes the intense moments seem even more intense, while the relaxed moments seem even more delicate. <br />Lyrically the record is not as good as it is musically. There really isn't a song with lyrics intense enough to make you feel like you just heard something metaphysically timeless, but having said that, Chris Martin doesn't embarrass himself. All-in-all, it's an album that is lyrically accessible - it won't leave anyone feeling overwhelmed.<br />As for the presentation of the album, it looks far more professional than Parachutes did. With its white cover and black-and-white photographs of the band, the art is simple and effective. While lyrics are not printed in the actual CD booklet, they are in a second booklet available as a promotional item. <br />While not as musically versatile as Oasis, not as powerful as U2, or as unique as Radiohead, Coldplay are carving out their own niche in popular music, and are carrying on the tradition of excellent British guitar bands.  Listen to this record.
0743455967|4.0|&quot;On Writing&quot; is divided into a number of sections. The first part, what he calls his CV, is a mini auto-biography and is absolutely terrific. Focussing primarily on those parts of his childhood that have effected his writing, this provides a riveting account of his development as a young aspiring writer.<br />The second section he calls the toolbox - those abilities you need to have or develop in order to be a good writer. Third, and following on from this, is the actual section on writing. There is some good stuff in these two sections but there is also a lot of take-this-as-fact when it's really just opionion. I'm going to focus on two of them; my rationale for placing these in the review is that they might be enough to put you off reading it:<br />a) He classifies writers into bad, competent, good and genius and declares that you can make a competent writer good but you can't make a bad writer competent. (I think we can all agree that geniuses are born, not made!) This is just plain wrong. You need to understand the reasons that the writer is bad. Perhaps the writer is just too young or too undeveloped; perhaps they just need some focus; perhaps they misuse a particular part of language terribly but have good ideas. Yes, there will always be people who are bad writers and always will be but it's my contention that anyone able to read &quot;On Writing&quot; has got the ability to be a competent writer, whatever the current state of their written ability is.<br />My second gripe is his hard and fast list of what makes bad writing. He has a particular grudge against the use of adverbs when describing conversation: 'she said excitedly', etc.. OK, so that's his opinion but it isn't a fast rule. In particular one of the current genius's (IMHO) is JK Rowling and she uses them all over the place (Stephen King has commented on that in his reviews of her books too). Personally I never even gave them a second thought until I saw him mention them. I re-read a few passages, thought - yup, she uses them a lot and, *they work*.<br />The next section is about his infamous car (or should I say pedestrian?) accident and recovery from it. This part brought back memories about my Dad's recovery from a car crash and I thought it was a very poignant section. I must say, though, I wonder if the book suffered from this since some of the On Writing section was the first writing Stephen did during his recovery.<br />In summary: This is a useful book for anyone interested in Stephen King, his writing, writing yourself or just understanding the process. But, don't expect too much information about actually writing and, what there is, is a little too rigid for my liking.
6304539282|1.0|Only twice have i ever been so disappointed with the movie world. Once was the collective disappoint that i have over George's prequel which is a whole nother review. And twice when i saw the \\"Special Editions\\".  I would agree that the cleaning up of old scenes and additions of background animartion to the films was a magnificiant idea, but i physically shudder when i think about the additions of the so called cut scenes. Personally i have never seen anything as [bad] as the Jabba Han Solo scene in \\"A New Hope\\".  Add that to the horrifying musical scene, and replacement of the original ending in Return of the Jedi and you have killed the star wars experience for this life long star wars fan.  In the end this viewer finds the upgrade a detestable mess, and wishes that he would have never seen the \\"Special Editions\\".  Do yourself a favor and by the THX upgrades that came out a few years before this [stuff]came out.
B00000634J|1.0|This compilation might have been more aptly titled \\"The Very Worst of John Lennon.\\" I have always been a Beatles' fan, but I never understood those Beatlemaniacs who made demigods of four average musicians who wrote some nice little melodies and who were packaged and promoted by a crafty public realtions man. If it were not for Brian Epstein, the Beatles quite probably would have gotten no farther than playing in dumpy clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg. More precisely, I never got the big fuss over John Lennon. Sure, it's a shame the way he was murdered. But as both a person and a mucisian, Lennon was far from some moralistic, enlightened wunderkind. He wasn't even a nice guy by the accounts of his closest \\"friends.\\" More to the point, Lennon's musical output in his post-Beatles' years was comprised of monotonous tunes (i.e., \\"Mind Games\\"), and druggie-influenced vamps like \\"Instant Karma.\\" His supposed \\"masterpiece\\"------\\"Imagine\\"---- is musically dronish and is lyrically little more than self-therapy for a guy who was paranoid and chemically dependent. None of these songs required a Cole Porter or Irving Berlin to write them. They are juvenile and simplistic to the point of being inane and meaningless. Indeed, Lennon's early Beatles compositions were primarily your typical three chord, twelve bar rock and roll. When he did attempt anything more sophisticated, he almost always came up short. While McCartney wrote dozens of melodious ballads, Lennon wrote mostly loud, abrasive songs littered with an overuse of pronouns and an abundance of grammatically silly word usage. The themes underlying virtually every one of his songs is jealousy, insecurity, and being dumped (remember \\"I'm A Loser?\\" \\"Help,\\" and \\"Misery\\"). He sang off key---screamed really---and he played only a small number of chords, as by his own admission he was not even a fair guitar player. He also was limited to piano playing only in the key of \\"C,\\" which is the easiest key in which to play. There were exceptions, like \\"Norwegian Wood,\\" but his overall sense of melody and harmony is juvenile compared with that of McCartney (who also had a far more pleasant and wider-ranging singing voice, and who also played a half-dozen instruments very well). And believe me, I harbor no delusions that McCartney was a musical genius. He was simply a far better mucisian and composer than Lennon. Indeed, by the 1970s Lennon's cruelty toward the handicapped, the obese, and the less fortunate became psychotic. I also don't remember this allegedly great liberal humanitarian divesting himself of his fortune to help the needy. With his maids, chauffers, numerous $100,000 automobiles, and multimillion dollars' worth of property around the world, the only appropriate word for describing Lennon is \\"hypocrite\\" with a capital \\"H.\\"
B00004XPOZ|1.0|I am sad to say that the special editions were not what i expected them to be.  While for the most part I welcoemd the additions and clarifying of special effects, there are a number of scene additions that ruined trhe movies for me.  Of these scenes none stick out more than the Jabba/Han Solo scene in the first movie.  To call this scene lacking is a serious understatment.  The part where han &quot;steps&quot; on Jabba's tail looks oike it was put together on a home computer by a kid in junior high. Along with the poor quality of this scene comes the explenation that Jabba has a disease to account for the color change.  Two other scene of negative maret are the musical scene in Return of the Jedi, and the complete changing of the final scene.  The first is a computer graphics song and dance routine straight from hades.  Out of nowhere comes this long, annoying, and uneeded musical scene.  And as for the replacement of the Ewok celebration, as I set waiting for th beloved song that i had grown accoustum to hearing at the end of my favorite sceries of movies i was suprise to hear a newly composed song with new backgrounds and scenery.  Call my old fashioned and a traditionalist, but i loved the sense of nostalgia for the origanal ending.  All and all this triology offers a few great improvements, and a whole lot of terrible change.  My advise skip this triology and buy the THX version that was released a few years before this one.
B000067CPX|3.0|I'm not a big &quot;Red Hot Chili Pepper&quot; fan but this album ain't half bad. It's certainly worth a listen. I love the song and the video &quot;Can't Stop&quot;
B00009MGQL|1.0|Isn't it time for Jeff to find a new direction?  This collection does continue in the vein of &quot;Who Else!&quot; and &quot;You Had it Coming&quot; but I found both of those to be more groundbreaking and enjoyable.  I'm a big Jeff Beck fan and I like his propensity to push the edge, but he is subject to an occasional wrong turn.  This CD is not so much a wrong turn as it is pointless.  Move on to something else, Jeff.  Please.

B0000062FJ|5.0|Santana's self-titled debut, along with ABRAXAS and III, is in a three-way tie for the best album ever by Santana. The best songs here are \\"Evil Ways\\", \\"Persuasion\\", \\"You Just Don't Care\\",  \\"Shades Of Time\\", and \\"Soul Sacrifice.\\" Organist-singer Gregg Rolie is as important an element to the album as Santana's lead guitar and the percussion of Chepito Areas and Michael Carabello. Rolie's and Santana's support for efforts to free people unjustly jailed in foreign countries, as well as for high-school community-service requirements, makes this CD an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience, so start with this one, ABRAXAS, III, THE ESSENTIAL SANTANA, and THE BEST OF SANTANA, then move on to MOONFLOWER, LOTUS, and the later albums.

0156027321|3.0|When I began this book, I was confident that I had stumbled on something innovative and clever. It began as a heartwarming novel that promised to reassert my faith in God and to dispell of my cynical views on life. The language and descriptive passages were sincere and charming. There were some moments of great humour. My spirits flagged and soared along with the endearing Pi's. When the background of the book shifted from colourful, sensual India to the expansive, blank Pacific, its momentum began to wain.<br />It collapsed in on itself annoyingly near the end of the book and brought the rest of the story with it. It somehow reminded me of a childs essay where it was &quot;all just a dream&quot;. Granted, the wide open sea is not exactly the perfect canvas to keep a novel afloat unless you have an interest in marine life. It encompassed all the best components of Garcia Marquez and the irritating absurdity of a  Beckett play. I thought it unnecessary and misleading for the author to inject the two Japanese characters to explain the significance of the animals in the boat. Insulting to the reader even. <br />I am curious as to the purpose of this novel. Was the author trying to demonstrate the triumph of the will? Perhaps the importance of the imagination and the necessity of belief, no matter if it is in a god or science? Was it just some rhetorical questions that no one can answer? Because of the ending, if the book had made a conclusion some 200 pages earlier I would have been a lot happier. Still, it is worth a read if you enjoyed Robinson Crusoe or Dr. Dolittle on a more aquatic scale.

B00004XONN|5.0|When I first heard this CD, I very much enjoyed it. After a while, I realized I didn't like it so much. What was the reason for this? I bought the album expecting weird, amazingly jittery electronica songs. But in my opinion there are only three songs on this album true to the above description. Then there are two almost straightforward rock songs, then some other rock songs that were fairly electronica-like. I then moved back to liking it, a lot. I guess that's the magic of Radiohead, and the rule is you either hate them with all your soul, or you desperately love them. <br />The album starts out with a kicker of an opening track, \\"Everything in It's Right Place\\". Everything on this track is in fact out of place. The best part is the intro, when a computer takes Thom Yorke's voice and spews it out making a noise that goes \\"bla-de-dah-bluh-blah-de-dah\\"... well, you can't really imitate it by writing it down. As the song progresses it's almost like Thom Yorke is having a nervous breakdown. Brilliant. <BR>Then comes the title track, which I've never really liked because it's too weird and offbeat. But secretely, down inside, it's my guilty pleasure song (along with Freak on a Leash by Korn :P)<BR>Track 3 is the gem of the album. \\"The National Anthem\\" is easily in my Top 5 favorite songs ever. Starting with some mean bass, some amazing drums kick in and echo-y vocals end with a scream over a countless number of blatting horns. By the end, it's like you're listening to a train wreck, and the horn section just finally dies out. Mesmerizing. <BR>\\"How to Disappear Completely\\" could be a simple acoustic track but is backed up by (something that sounds like) an orchestra. Beautiful. <BR>Not much happens in \\"Treefingers\\" but after a few listens the calmness grows on you and it's a nice track to listen to.<BR>\\"Optimistic\\" is pretty much a straightforward rock song. It has great guitar and good lyrics \\"You can try the best you can/ The best you can is good enough\\" (optimistic lyrics... wow!) Yet underneath there is a dark message. <BR>\\"In Limbo\\" is a beautiful track with a soothing guitar that for some reason brings back memories of the early 90's (??) \\"Idioteque\\" is as \\"OMG dancefloor killer groove LOL!!!11!!1\\" as Radiohead have ever gotten. The beat is contagious but as it progresses the gloominess engulfs the radio-friendliness. <BR>\\"Morning Bell\\" has some great drums and \\"Motion Picture Soundtrack\\" is very soothing. <br />Altogether, Kid A is not an album for the superificial listener. After some runs in the CD player and maybe a look beyond just the sounds that the CD makes, Kid A is a fragile and intricate album.

B000003TAR|5.0|nirvanas last album In Utero hit the shelves in mid 93 confusing fans of their earlier work. This record is the most heart felt/ emotional album ever. It is also the most diverse albums ever. It has a mix of pop,rock,metal,noise and art. This album changed cobain from a pop singer to an artist. The lyrics are amazing and the tunes are brilliant. Even though kurt cobain wasnt the best guitar player ever he had alot of passion at thats what count. Musicianship plays a small role in ones greatness. Slash and most of the 80's guitarist could play the guitar with great talent but had no passion for the music, nor did they produce great tunes but just walls of guitar solos or foredom. <br />The album starts of with a great sludgey roar of guitar symbolising the new sound of nirvana. The first song serve the servants is about cobains misfortunate childhood and living with out a fatherly figure. The second track scentless apprecntice is a brilliant song based around bodily functions and scents. The themme of the body and women run through this album. The third  track heart shaped box is a classic nirvana song with a soft verse and heavy chorus. Rape me the next track is a anti rape song about how cobain was raped by the media and or how a women was raped by a man and he went to jail and he got raped. the fifth track frances farmer will have revenge on seattle is about a female actress france farmer, but i believe it is actually about the NEVERMIND fans and how nirvana would looser the FAKE fans with this new album. Dumb the next track is the greatest and saddest song ever. It is so brilliant and words cant describe it. the next track very ape is a fun 1 minute track that is dark but very poppy. Milk it is the most underrated song ever, the lyrics are brilliant and the chorus is the greatest chorus in music history. Track 9 bring penny royal tea, a song about abortion and how stupid those pro life people are. the next track is the song that scared most nevermind fans away, Radio friendly unit shifter, i know it does sound like an 80's song 'UNIT SHIFTER' but it is very harsh and emotional and is just a great song. THe next track is another fun 1 minute song with alot of screaming and great drums, very catchy and fun. The last track all apologies is the bands goodbye. It is so good, the lyrics are somewhat ironic seeing kurt cobain killed himself not lnog after its release.<br />Go listen to this album and read the lyircs while your listening it twice as appreciating.

0380002930|4.0|It thought that Watership Down was a wonderful book.  It gives you an idea of what it was like to be in a rabbits world and all of the fears and challenges that rabbits have to go through every day.  All though I thought that Watership Down got off to a slow start, it really picked up at the end.  I also liked the stories that were told about El-ahrairah in some of the chapters of the book.  I thought that it was interesting how Fiver could always tell what to do and had foresights about things that were going to happen later in the story.  For instance, Fiver knew that something was going to happen to their home warren and got as many rabbits as he could to leave the warren.  Also when their group of rabbits came upon a warren of rabbits that seemed perfectly fine, Fiver somehow knew that their was something different about their warren.  I also liked that even though their were so many problems, they were finally able to overcome them, the main one was getting does to their warren from Efrafa.<br />This Novel is different from the others that I have read because it gives people of an idea of another animals life and how what we do really affects other animals around us.  This is a different kind of fantisy then other books.  In this book, instead of having whichs and wizards or wrinkles of time, it is about rabbits on an adventure to do the impossible, but finally come through and complete what they had sent out to do.<br />I think that people should read this book, because it gives you an idea of what it is like to be a rabbit, and all of the many fears and challenges that happen in their everyday life.  If you are a person who doesn't like to read long books, I would not recommend this book for you.  But if you don't mind long books, I think that this is an amazing book and I think that you should read it.  It has adventure, challenges, comedy, and many other things that make books so great.  I would highly recommend this book and hope that you will enjoy it asmuch as I did.
B00000IQC8|5.0|This classic low-budget, rudely humorous, 1994 film was the first done by director Kevin Smith. Most of the movie takes place in a small local convience store. Dante, the only clerk working in their was called in despite the other goings on that were happening that day. His girlfriend comes to cheer him up, only to have him find out that his girlfriend has (well, actually I can't say it here) to multiple other people. To annoy him even more is the irresponsible Randal who works in a video rental store across the street, even though he likes to go to another one miles away and is bearily in the one he works in. Randal spends the whole day pissing off both Dante and the customers, and also trying to get Jay and Silent Bob to stop dealing drugs outside of his video store with their heavy metal singing Russian friend. <br />Shot in black and white on an extreme low budget, this film would lead Kevin Smith into the mainstream eye, and he would begin to work with big name actors including George Carlin, Chris Rock, even Ben and Matt. With his follow ups Mallrats, Chasing Amy and Dogma, he would prove himself as one of the most independently influenced directors iin mainstream Hollywood (these movies are also hilarious). Smith would also continue to star in his moovies as the ever-quiet Silent Bob, who teamed up with his partner Jay (they would become the main interest in the movie because of their quick and vulger humor and classic one-liners). Kevin Smith will probably continue to make people laugh with his oddball brand of humor for years to come.
B00005JLXE|4.0|This is not an academy award winner, but it is an entertaining movie with a great cast.  Ben Affleck puts out one of his better performances as the blind superhero, Matt Murdock, better known as the Daredevil.  And Jennifer Garner is absolutely stunning in her role as Elektra Natchios.  Daredevil is darker than Spider-Man and is the best comic book movie since the first Batman.  The plot is weak at times, but that does not take away from the energy of the movie.
B000002H97|2.0|This album marked the beginning of the end for thrash metal legends Metallica. No longer producing the 8-minute epic thash metal pieces like Master of Puppets, And Justice For All, and Disposable Heroes, they began to play shorter more straight forward radio hit songs like Enter Sandman and Sad But True, and soft rock songs like Unforgiven and Nothing Else Matters. Why did they have to change? They were brilliant they way they were making amazing songs like One, Battery, Dyers Eve. Everything Metallica stood for went down with this album. They were a badass metal band with tons of fans and no radio play. They were the ones who claimed to hate pop with a passion in the early days making fun of bands like Motley Crue and Def Leppard, but then they became the same thing. A pop rock group with catchy sing along songs. The only reason this album recieved two stars from me is because there are two tracks that are really good. And probably because I love Metallica and just could not give them one star. The only good songs are Wherever I May Roam and Through The Never. The rest [...]. All slow and boring with terrible wah-pedal infested solos and catchy chorus' for fans of pop to sing along to. Please realize Metallica for what they really are, buy the brilliant albums, Kill Em' All, Ride The Lightning, Master Of Puppets, And Justice For All.[...].
B000089RVX|5.0|...And that's a very good thing. I can easily say that this is my new favorite album! Every song on here is worth listening to!<br />Going Under: A great song, but it gets a little old after awhile. 9.5/10<br />Bring Me To Life: The mega-hit that first attracted me to this band. Amazing rock, with a few pop strains in it, but it will get overplayed after hearing on the radio, plus listening to the album a lot. 9/10<br />Everybody's Fool: Another cool song, but the chorus is slightly disappointing. Lyrics are cool though. 9/10<br />My Immortal: Beautiful! The dark goth/haunting ballad is amazing. I skip it sometimes, 'cause it's a little boring, but if you're ever in a dark mood, switch this song on, it's awesome. 9.5/10<br />Haunted: An incredibly eerie ballad, styled a little bit after haunted house music. Amy's voice will embed the lyrics in your mind for weeks. 10/10<br />Tourniquet: Another dark song, with a lot of despair built into the lyrics. It almost feels like you're watching Amy die, and will make you prone to deep dark thoughts. 10/10<br />Imaginary: One of my personal favorites. It's beautiful, and dreamlike. You can't make up your mind if it's a good dream or a nightmare. 10/10<br />Taking Over Me: This song will grow on you as you listen to it. The lyrics are sad and haunting, you won't forget them soon. 10/10<br />Hello: At first listen, this is a little boring and repetitive, but the more you listen, the more you'll love it. Even after listening to the violent Haunted and Tourniquet, this song is still the most hauntingly beautiful track. Probably my favorite on the album. 10/10<br />My Last Breath: The tune is catchy and hard to get out of your head, but it's the poetic lyrics that really stand out on this song. Another highlight. 10/10<br />Whisper: The only letdown on the album. Don't get me wrong, it's a great song, but especially towards the end, it seems to lose the impact the rest of the album carried. 8/10<br />Overall this dark, brooding goth-rock album is incredible. A must have for any fan of the genre. I can't wait for the next album!
0385504209|3.0|In the House on Mango Street, the story of a struggling Mexican American family is told through the perspective of their eldest daughter Esperanza. Esperanza, a name which means hope in Spanish, narrates her life throughout the story as she comments on her growth into a woman and her struggles to break free from her culture's gender roles. Although author Susan Cisneros poetic style adds beauty to the story through rich imagery and style, the novel lacks such richness in plot and character development.<br /> As the story begins, the family moves into a rundown house located on Mango Street. The house is not what Esperanza had expected. Unlike her dream of a large expensive house, she finds herself once again living in a poor house in the Barrio. It is at this point that Esperanza reveals that her greatest dream is to one day have a house of her own which is far different than the one on Mango Street. Unlike what Esperanza has ever know, she decides that one day she will have a nice house with a white fence and flowers in the yard.<br /> Although the story does give perceptions into the people around Esperanza, we are more or less left questioning who these people are and what their relevance is to Esperanza's development. The characters in the novel are colorful and interesting yet often times lack depth and we as readers and not left with a clear sense of  what it is that makes them tick. Instead we are given only a brief description of characters with Esperanza's comments as our only clue to understanding them. Without more knowledge or reference to these characters, we cannot understand the dynamic in which Esperanza has to interact with and we are left feeling like the only character we really know is Esperanza.<br /> Unlike a plot with a distinct set of events or interactions with other characters, the story line seemed redundant and lacking excitement. I often founds that the novel would loose my attention in a vast sea of wording and imagery with little else. Although Cisneros style of writing greatly added to the story, there was little else that was substantial enough to keep the reader interested. Also, unlike a plot in which there is a distinct story line, the plot is vaguer and free floating due to the nature of the narration. Rather than following along with a story line, we are following along with the mind of a young child.

Also, unlike a plot in which there is a distinct story line, the plot is vaguer and free floating due to the nature of the narration. Rather than following along with a story line, we are following along with the mind of a young child.

B00009MECF|4.0|Forget &quot;Titanic&quot; and &quot;The Gangs of New York&quot;, one of Leonardo DiCaprio's best performances is right here in the '90s film &quot;The Basketball Diaries&quot;. I'll admit, when I first saw this movie I was a prepubescent wanting to capture Leo in all his glory at the height of the &quot;Titanic&quot; craze. I didn't get this movie at all the first time I watched it, but I could sure tell it was graphic, violent, and at times, very sickenly disturbing. <BR>It took a few more years till I could digest &quot;Diaries&quot; and appreciate it for what it really is: an indie movie with strong performances and grit.
B00005Y228|1.0|I seriously dont see the appeal behind Kylie Minogue. The frist single was really cool and different. She was everywhere. Then she dissapeared. I decided to listen to some tracks from this album and they all sounded very dull and boring. &quot;Love At First Sight&quot; sounds like recycled 80's Madonna, who by the way is MUCH better and to compare Kylie to Madonna is an insult to Madonna. I do not find her attractive and she seems disturbingly thin (ie: jennifer anniston). please get Madonna's albums instead. Kylie was a one hit wonder in the US and I hope it stays that way. Keep it on the other side of the ocean please.
B00007BK2N|5.0|I rented and then bought this movie because I am a Joy Division and early punk fan, but I ended up learning a lot about the Manchester rave scene.<BR>Tony Wilson's commentary is a great thing to listen to, if only for his clarification of the film's myths. Steve Coogan is great as Tony Wilson, as is Sean Harris as Ian Curtis. <BR>About the Happy Mondays section. Though there are plenty of myths they could have chosen from, most of the ones used in this movie are fictional. But they portray Bez and Shaun Ryder in a very funny way.<BR>This movie is both extremely funny and depressing. If you're a music fan, it's good to own. I could watch it very many times.
B00008DDSC|5.0|This is not necessarily the prurient film it touts itself to be.  I was surprised it was much more serious and much more beautiful - - yes, beautiful - - a story than I had ever anticipated!  This film could easily have become much more twisted and dark (Boxing Helena, anyone?) or much more campy (Frankenhooker), but instead it evolves into an examination of a mutually satisfying relationship - - on an emotional level, even though there is a lot of the physical going on.  There is humor, but it is subtle enough to kind of tickle your brain fleetingly and keep you in the story.  The submission/domination plot line is actually very cerebral.  I think you could actually get two very different movie-going experiences with this film.  One would be a \\"oh, what a sweet movie, plus I got some kinky eye-candy to boot\\" and the other would be an experience where you recognize symbolism, you examine self-empowerment issues, you mentally debate feminist vs traditional ideals, etc.  But then again, maybe I just think too much!  <br />James Spader (as Edward) is just wonderful at playing this type of character, tortured and mysterious, and Maggie Gyllenhaal (as Lee) very effectively blossoms from beginning to end of the story.  The extraneous characters are developed just enough to give you a good sense of what their roles (dysfunctions and all) are before the story begins, and leaves them at that.  Yes, I had questions but easily let them go.  The true focus is on Lee and Edward.  I must also mention, without actually spoiling the plot for you, the storyline between the pinnacle of the conflict to the ending is just fraught with fantastic symbolism, utilizing nudity, nature, water, light.  It really piqued the intellectual part of my brain.<br />All in all, I think this movie could be one of my new favorite love stories.  I'm not a fan of the Meg Ryan/Tom Hanks syrupy sweet romantic comedies, but \\"Secretary\\" was much easier for me to relate to because the characters are so non-perfect.  As a mother, this is not a movie I would be comfortable watching with my children present.  I am not a prude, and certainly not opposed to a good swat on the behind now and then, but there is one scene in particular that would bring up too many questions.  It is, after all, rated R for a reason.
B000005DSN|5.0|I've just recently became a Stratovarius fan this year and have now listened to all their CDs over and over and over. I have to say that not only do I think Visions is the band's BEST CD, I think this is one of the GREATEST albums EVER. Every track on this cd is great. I cannot even pick 1 or 2 songs that I think are the best, because I think that besides Holy Light, Before the Winter and Coming Home (which are still good songs), the other 7 songs are simply AWESOME. The title track is a 10 minute masterpiece that ends the CD perfectly. That final chorus simply blows me away. If anyone says this track is too long, they are SORELY mistaken. The song is so good, it doesn't even seem like 10 minutes. I wish it was longer. Try listening to this song with headphones on your home stereo and crank it up as loud as your ears can take. The affect is AMAZING.<br />If I HAD to pick my 3 favorite tracks, they would have to be \\"Paradise\\", \\"Legions\\" and \\"Abyss of your Eyes\\" with the others (first 3 tracks) certainly NOT TOO FAR BEHIND. In fact I might even say it's a 7-way tie. That's how much I love this CD.<br />Stratovarius has taken Hard Rock to whole new level especially starting with the Timo K era and all their 6 Timo K cds are great but Visions is a TRUE MASTERPIECE of music. Any hard rock fan will like this album to some degree. If not, then they don't appreciate good/creative music.<br />It's only a shame that Stratovarius is not even heard of here in the United States (nor ever on tour here) because we can SURE use their talent over here because today's hard rock bands in the United States simply stink. And that's putting it mildly. Look who we have over here, System of a Down, POD and Drowning Pool? PLEASE!!! Those bands are sickening compared to Strato. Whenever  I saw the song \\"Drops of Jupiter\\" by Train win the Grammy for best rock song of the year a couple of years ago, I said \\"never again will I ever watch the Grammys\\". How can a song LIKE THAT win when you have Stratovarius songs (pick any one) that can raise your adrenalin level to the highest meter mark?<br />Thank God for Stratovarius! I'll show my support for this band ALWAYS even if it means buying their CDs over the internet if I cannot find it here. They are a mountain of talent and have proved it with Visions.<br />BUY THIS CD NOW. You won't regret it. It's worth all 5 stars.Stratovarius songs (pick any one) that can raise your adrenalin level to the highest meter mark? <br />Thank God for Stratovarius!

0553106635|5.0|After I began reading the Robert Jordan Series I swore I would never begin reading a series of books that had not been finished again.  I was weak and this time it really cost me.  Fortunately, the Jordan series became weaker and weaker with each book and therefor the waiting was quite tolerable. This is not the case with George R.R. Martins epic &quot;A Song of Fire and Ice&quot; series.  These books are beyond excellent from cover to cover.  Depth of character, interesting story lines, and what I like best: Martin does not rely on characters with super magic powers that are completely undefeatable to guide the current of the story.  I will suffer the next 10 months awaiting the next novel but, if it is of as high of quality as the preceeding 3 books the wait for the 5th book may be quite intolerable.  My recommendation: Wait until Martin finishes the series until you start!!!!
0767821769|2.0|This is sort of a dumb movie full of cliques and melodrama.  It was perfect for the Christmas season when it was released.  Who couldn't find heartwarming a tale of wayward ex-husband shacking up with good-hearted but shallow chippie who clashes with spoiled but good-hearted kids and shrew-like ex-wife.  But shrew-like ex-wife is croaking and realizes good-hearted but shallow chippie will end up raising her spoiled but sweet children.  Does the chippie mature enough to handle the job by the end of the flick?  What do you think.  They all end up happy at the end, though shrew-like ex-wife still bites the dust but not after mending all fences with wayward ex-husband and shallow but good-hearted chippie.  Stupid and predictable, this film nonetheless is pretty good to watch to pass time and is entertaining.  Credit the great cast making soapdish junk watchable.  I still have to cringe, though, when Sarandon makes that awful cape for the son.  Yuck, totally dumb gift.  Julia Roberts could have shown some more flesh as well, but it works.
0783225970|5.0|This classic movie cronicles the intense life of refugee turned drug dealing king Tony &quot;Scarface&quot; Montana. Directed by Brian De Palma, this harsh, real film gives a look into the mind of Montana and his climb to the top of the world and the troubles he faces on his way up. Pachino does an awesome job potraying Montana in this modern adaptation of the Howard Hawks classic.
B00006879E|5.0|Maroon5 is now one my favorite bands.  The songs on this cd are the songs that you say to yourself &quot;they sing this song?!?&quot;.  This is a great cd to listen to when you are just chilling by yourself.  My favorite songs on the cd are &quot;Harder to Breathe&quot;, &quot;This Love&quot;, &quot;Shiver&quot;, and &quot;She Will Be Loved.&quot;
0767830555|5.0|This classic movie, brilliantly directed by Martin Scorsese, stars Robert De Niro as Travis Bickle.<br />Bickle is a retired Marine who is now an urban taxi driver. He thinks that his urban area is a pile of [pooh] and shows how humanity is going downhill. He plays gaurdian angel to a prostitue, played by Jodie Foster. He is a truely disturbed individual, and becomes extreme violent and sinister. This film gives a very vivid look into the mind of a man gone insane. <br />Scorsese shows how the most disturbing people are the ones that you least expect. How someone that you trust will never hurt you, can be lead to put you into danger. Many people who saw this movie were horrifiied and diesgusted by the storyline. The movie has often been misunderstood as a violent and graphic, however, this film is a classic look at how far and disturbed a mind can be. The evil in the movie is to show the intense disturbance inside a man's head.
B000066C1N|5.0|This cd is incredible!!!  I saw the movie and loved it.  So why not the cd just as good.  Hans Zimmer's music is incredible along with the lyrics of bryan adams, totally brings the cd together.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|This great movie follows in the tradition of other animated films like &quot;Toy Story&quot;, &quot;Ice Age&quot;, and &quot;Monsters Inc.&quot; where adults and children alike will enjoy it.  Shrek (Mike Myers) is a lovable ogre who wants nothing more than to live in his happy little swamp, but unknown to him, Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) has revoked the deed to his swamp.  Meanwhile, Lord Farquaad has fallen in love with the beautiful Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz), but she is being held captive in a castle guarded by an angry dragon. Shrek wins a competition held by Farquaad to rescue Fiona on the condition that he gets his swamp back.  So, with his new friend Donkey (Eddie Murphy), Shrek sets off on his quest.<br />Finally, Fiona is rescued from the dragon, but Shrek is experiencing a feeling he's never felt before; love.  He is smitten with Fiona almost instantly, but Fiona is intent on returning to Farquaad's castle to meet him.  However, Fiona holds her own secret which she's afraid to reveal.  What will become of Fiona, Shrek, and Farquaad?  Will Shrek get his beloved swamp back?<br />I found this to be an excellent movie. Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz, John Lithgow, and especially Eddie Murpy give top notch performances.  I watched this movie with my two young children and they were captivated the entire time.  The music in the film is good, too, especially the remake of the Monkees' &quot;I'm a Believer&quot;.  Watch this movie and get a good chuckle.
B00007GZVS|5.0|Prior to King Henry the VIII's death, the major conflict in lands under his rule, England, France, and Scotland, Catholicism was predominant and Protestants were tortured and burned at the stake.  Mary Tudor, a daughter of Henry the VIII, became Queen when the king died.  Mary's half sister, Elizabeth, was the illegitimate child of Henry the VIII and of Ann Bolin, which made Elizabeth also an heir to the king's throne.  Mary was a devote Catholic and Elizabeth was a devout Protestant, which only intensified the ongoing conflict.  Mary contracted cancer and died and Elizabeth was crowned Queen.  <br />In the movie, Elizabeth, Elizabeth portrays a female protagonist that is continually challenged and threatened by a number of antagonists opposed at Elizabeth, claiming the crown and the throne.  One of the main antagonist's was the Duke of Norfolk who had everything to gain from her being dethroned, namely the crown.  The dominating theme throughout the movie was Elizabeth fighting to claim the right to be Queen to the point of killing her enemies to bring peace and unity to her \\"people,\\" by unifying under one religion.  <br />The main characters are as follows:  Cate Blanchett as Elizabeth I, Geoffrey Rush as Sir Francis Walsingham, Joseph Fiennes as Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, Christopher Eccleston as the Duke of Norfolk, Richard Attenborough as Sir William Cecil, Lord Burghley, and John Gielgud as the Pope.  The movie was the winner of the Golden Globe Award for Drama and Cate Blanchett won the best actress award.  Geoffrey Rush, Richard Attenborough, and John Gielgud are Academy Award winning actors as well.<br />To strengthen alliances, the royal council encouraged Elizabeth to consider the proposal of marriage as offered by King Phillip the II of Spain, but through King Phillip's own foolery and crude nature, the attempt to marry and ally forces failed.  Elizabeth and Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, were lovers up until the time it was disclosed Robert was already married, thereafter Elizabeth refused Robert private audience.  At was also during this time that two attempts were made on Queen Elizabeth's life.  As a result of this, Sir Francis Walsingham, killed Mary, Queen of Scots who wished to rule in Elizabeth's place, which was a turning point.  Walsingham also uncovered a plot that was signed by the Pope, Spanish Minister, Spanish King, religious leaders, Duke of Norfolk and his followers, and Robert Dudley to overthrow Queen Elizabeth.  All of her nearby enemies and traitors were executed with the exception of Robert Dudley.  Elizabeth kept Robert alive to remind her \\"just how close\\" the Queen had been \\"to danger.\\"  <br />A deeper symbolism was revealed in two scenes in this movie. The first scene symbolizes the making or beginnings of a Queen, which was when Elizabeth walked outside into a blinding light and that was when she heard that Mary, her sister the Queen, was dead, and Elizabeth was proclaimed Queen. The second scene was when Elizabeth transformed herself into the \\"Virgin Queen\\" and backlit from the outside light she entered the court proclaiming that she was \\"married to the church\\" and became the Queen.<br />I rate this movie a 5 stars movie because it is one of the most enthralling and believable versions of the life of Queen Elizabeth that has been made-to-date.  It makes no pretenses how people struggled to survive and the sort of treacheries that befell people for having different values, morals, religions and classes. The acting was superb. The gowns and sceneries were beautiful.  I find that I watch the kind of movies over and over that make me aspire to be greater than who I am and this is one of those movies.
B00005JLEU|1.0|My friend and I just watched Spirted Away last night, and I have to say, I don't see what all the fuss is about.  The artwork is beautiful, but the story was frustrating and non-sensical.  We are both fans of artsy films, but we continuously found ourselves laughing at this movie, and not in an intentionally funny way.  Our most common comments were, &quot;This makes no sense,&quot; &quot;This must be for people who like to ACT like they are intellectual,&quot; or, &quot;Oh my god this is hoakey.&quot;  I cannot think of a better example of something being over-hyped.  We also found ourselves wondering if Japanese people have a lot of self hatred, seeing that none of the characters in the film (or japanimation in general) looked even remotely Asian.

B00003CXFG|5.0|One rule: Buy it... don't mess with the rated version... you WANT the Director's cut... the scenes add so much to the depth of the movie.<br />I won't ramble on about plot, special effects, etc. because those have been addressed before. The first time I watched this movie (original release), I liked it alot. The second, third and fourth times I began to discover so much more of the dialogue and character development that I had missed on the earlier viewings. Now, I get to enjoy the movie with the footage it SHOULD have had for the original release. And the commentary by Vin Diesel, Cole Hauser and David Twohy will have you laughing your as* off! Highly recommended!<br />Vin Diesel evolves smoothly from evil bad-as* to the emerging anti-hero of the flick and I savored every minute of it (insert primal feminine growl here). The other members of the crew were great... each developing their particular personalities that made this film so intense. Even the unidentified \\"survivor\\" who meets with an unhappy surprise sticks in your mind (if I heard correctly, the actor was also Vin's stunt double).<br />After you enjoy the film, take a trip around the web and read some of the fanfic available. I am simply amazed and impressed at the work of some of the fans.  My current fave is \\"Apprentice\\" by Ardath Rekha (sp?) at ... Don't go there if you are looking for PG rating, though.<br />Enough! Get the DVD!!!!

6302787068|5.0|This movie is the B-E-S-T one but The 2nd movie was better!<BR>Anyway this one is still good though.&quot;whole new world&quot; was the best song ever!&quot;arabian nights was so dumb. I recomend &quot;whole new world&quot;.
B00005ARDC|4.0|the second full-length album from these leather-bound angels kicks you in the mouth with it's bluesy and muffled layer of guitar riffs. chords jam packed full of fuzz seem to come from nowhere on all sides. Tracks like love burns, whatever happened to my rock n roll (punk song), as sure as the sun, and salvation are flipping great songs not to mention the other 7 awesome tracks. Vocals reminiscent of the velvet underground and the dandy warhols. If you enjoy these bands definitley check them out. this album gets 10 thumbs up

B000055Y0X|4.0|\\"Dr. Strangelove\\" had to have seemed strange indeed to 1964 audiences.  This came out in the same year as colorful, old-fashioned Hollywood fare like \\"My Fair Lady\\" and \\"Mary Poppins.\\"  Yet \\"Strangelove\\" is far from old-fashioned or even colorful.  Kubrick's film is stark and cold with a documentary-like air to it.  It's also riotously funny.<br />Peter Sellers is a film treasure.  This film is a an orgy for Sellers fans, since he plays no less than three different characters, stretching his chameleon-like acting abilities to the limit.  The funniest of his three characters is the dead-pan president of the United States, and the film's funniest scene involves him trying to gently break to the Russian premiere that we are about to launch a nuclear attack on his country.  His portrayal of the title character is also inspired, and the image of Sellers in that wheelchair wrestling his black-gloved hand into submission with that crazy shock of hair and crazier glint in his eyes is unforgettable.<br />The film also sports a great supporting cast, most notably George C. Scott as Buck Turgison, who discreetly takes calls from his bikini-clad girlfriend during war room briefings, Sterling Hayden as General Jack D. Ripper, who wields his cigar like a dangerous weapon, and Slim Pickens, as the pilot of the plane that is about to end civilization as we know it.  <br />My only complaint with the film is its somewhat sluggish editing, especially in the scenes showing the fleet of bombers on its way to their Russian targets.  At times, the movie actually drags slightly, even though it's only 90 minutes long.<br />But this is a minor quibble about a film that has rightly earned a spot in the cultural conscience of America.  It will never be irrelevant as long as the ability to wage nuclear war exists, and it doesn't look like that problem will be going away any time soon.
B00000253N|4.0|I've owned this album for a few years, and I still listen to it regularly.  It's such a sad, outpouring of grief (except Lily, Rosemary & the Jack of Hearts).  The lyrics are outstanding: \\"I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before... you're gonna make me lonesome when you go\\", yet just as much is conveyed in the delivery.  I hope I never feel heartache like it.<br />Sometimes I find myself hitting the Stop button after a few songs, sacrilegious though it might be to say, I find the album a little tiresome sometimes unless I am really in the mood.  \\"Idiot Wind\\" particularly, although it is a great song (personally, I prefer the Bootleg Series version, now that's heartfelt!).  But some of the songs just defy description.  \\"Shelter from the Storm\\" is rightly proclaimed as a classic \\"Twas in another lifetime, one of toil & blood, when blackness was a virtue...\\".  If you're like me, and find his voice a bit grating after a while, try \\"Oh Mercy\\", now that's a true classic.  Glorious production by Daniel Lanois, haunting instrumentation from Dylan. I challenge anyone not to feel the hairs rising on their neck during \\"Man In The Long Black Coat\\".<br />In response to cranky reviewer: are you just trying to elicit response through exaggerated claims? Come on, Justin Timberlake is a better artist?!  Give me strength!  Better production?   True emotion is conveyed through this recording, you even can hear his jacket buttons striking the guitar (thanks Bootleg Series for that tidbit!).  Like all good folk albums, it paints a picture of the scene for the listener, you can imagine what he looks like, the surroundings.  Justin Timberlake is just famous for getting into Britney's pants, but then again, each to their own.  I'm just not convinced you can seriously suggest Titanic is a great film and 2001 A Space Odyssey is not, or J Lo is a genius, you must be taking the mick...
B00006LPER|2.0|Hardly. Erika (Isabelle Huppert) is one of the highest regarded and sought after classical piano instructors around. She's held in very high esteem at the conservatory where she teaches. She holds private lessons and does recitals. She's prim, proper and brutally strict with her students. She also cruises porno shops, watches the porn videos (graphically displayed and the only skin in this film) and peeps in lovers' parked cars at the drive-in where she gets so turned on she urinates. She also cuts her vagina with a razor when frustrated. She lives with her aged harridan mother (Annie Girardot) who pushes her daughter to achieve so hard that it results in mama bashing. Then along comes stud-puppy/jock/wanna-be piano whiz Walter (Benoit Magimel) who starts hitting on Erika right and left until she caves in (in a bathroom) and reveals her inability to have normal sex which frustrates the heck out of Walter. But he professes to love her and agrees to whatever she wants. Sort of. She writes a letter telling him what she wants. The utter degradation she desires in that letter made me wonder, dear Lord---how many \\"dark sides\\" does this woman have? She wants to be tied up, slapped around, beaten, sexually humiliated, gagged---the list goes on and on. Walter is repulsed. No dice, Erika. She follows him and begs for his forgiveness and then promptly throws up when he complies to her demands for impromptu oral sex. He throws her out in disgust. Then he comes begging back in the middle of the night, claiming she's bewitched his brain with her \\"sickness\\". He locks Mama in the bedroom, brutally beats and kicks Erika and rapes her. He says in effect, \\"Isn't this what you wanted?\\" What a cad. He even gets away with it. But the ending is what really threw me. I felt like I was the one needing a good slap. The performances in this film are excellent. Especially Huppert. But I can't believe she let the director get away with that ending. It just left me empty and mad that I watched it. The character of Walter is disgusting. Erika is no less pathetic---she's extremely sick and even puts broken glass in a promising but scared student's coat pocket so she'll slice up her hand and can't play. And gets away with it!  I don't know who I could recommend this film to. It's played so dreadfully serious---even the scene where Erika tries to have sex with her mother. All I can say is, if you've read what I've written here and you still want to see it, then go for it. But if you're the least bit hesitant, stay away from it. It's that disturbing and unbelievable.

B00001QEE9|5.0|&quot;When you wish upon a star, makes no difference who you<br />are, anything you heart desires will come to you.&quot;<br />You've heard this song on the Disneyland and Superbowl commercials, but do you remember where it came from?<br />It came from this cartoon, Pinocchio, Walt Disney's second feature to &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; in 1940.<br />I repeat 1940!! Wow and to this day ,Pinocchio still stands out as one of the greatest movies of all time.<br />This opinion is about the 60th anniversay VHS of Pinocchio with THX sound and Remastered visual footage. It even has a bonus at the end about the making of Pinocchio!!! Wow.<br />This was a Christmas gift for my best friend and she loved it, and I can see why.<br />Pinocchio is filled with dazzling animation,music and filled with so much fun and happyness that at the end of the movie , you will feel like wishing upon a star youreself.<br />Pinocchio is about a wooden puppet made by toymaker Geppeto (Christian Rub) who wants his own son.<br />Geppeto makes one wish, to have his own son. Geppeto gets his wish when the Blue Fairy brings Pinocchio to life!!!<br />It took nearly 700 animators and technicians to bring Pinocchio to life and the hard work definitely shows!!!<br />People can say whatever they want about Disney current movies, true they lack a certain magic unlike their cherish cartoon like Pinocchio, but Disney is one of a few companies that has a SOLID record of making Cartoon Classics that are loved by everyone.<br />The fairy brings Pinocchio to life and promises to Pinoccho (voice of Dickie Jones) that he will remain a real boy if he follows the basic principles that every boy should have.<br />He has to be loyal, truthful and above fair. She assigns Jiminy Cricket (Cliff Edwards) to be Pinocchio's conscience.<br />Well it sounds easy at first, but living up to these values is the real challenge here and Pinocchio tries his best to follow them,but since he has just being turned intoa boy he doesnt yet know right from wrong.<br />This is where we meet characters like ,J. Worthington Foulfellow, Stromboli and Barker who take advantage of the young boy.<br />Jiminy Cricket and the fairy save Pinocchio from his judgement calls ,but yet Pinocchio doesnt learn to tell the truth and when he lies his nose starts to grow like a Christmas tree. :-)<br />Meanwhile Geppeto is looking for Pinocchio and ends up being captured by a giant whale Monstro!!!<br />Pinocchio saves Geppeto in a brillian animation sequence and Pinocchio by displaying bravery ends up being a real boy permanently.<br />It's a classic, I can say more but I dont want to spoil it for anyone<br />In an age, where moral, brilliant, wholesome cartoons are scarce you look back to the classics and Pinocchio will forever stand out as one of the greatest classics ever made by Walt Disney who has left his print in the world and in children's hearts.<br />Go out and buy this for youre children
B000001FS3|5.0|I must say after looking at the rating of 4.5 i had to jump on and give this irish band a 5 star rating!! Every song on this cd is worth listening too... The music on this cd is as easy as clicking repeat on your player and never getting tired of it! I've over used this cd so much i believe i'm on my 3rd copy of it! If you love, like, or even heard one great song from U2 then, this CD will make u a fan for life~! I give it an easy 5 star rating all the way!
B00005JM09|3.0|Well it was an old movies ditto copy. In terminator 2 , the rescurer was a step down than the terminator and the same case was in this film too. No change to this regard. Destruction of the world with the help of computers seems to be a fake idea and a impossible school of thought. Further more, the movie and the action is good. One thing i fail to understand here that in all the series any body coming from the future comes naked, don't they wear cloths there in the future i mean. To increase the interest the director this time sent a nude girl, which really boosted the film's interest. Overall this is a good effort to kill you 100 minutes.
B000002VSN|5.0|If this was woulda came out the same time as Aretha Franklins AMAZING GRACE album, it woulda gotten major props. Especially since Whitney can sing. I do since a lack of higher rang on the voice of the singer. Maybe she was stressed out? Maybe she was tired? Whatever the reason was, overall, this album fa sho get's major props from this dude.<br />Since this album came out at a time when gospel was outta demand, it did very poorly on the charts. It went straight to #1 on the charts in the hearts of true fans of the music of the Lord and Whitney Fans. I'm not really a whitney fan but this album is FANTASTIC. Especially THE LORD IS MY SHEPHERD sung by her greatest idol: Her Mother, Sissy Houston. It gets 5 stars for two reasons: IT'S FOR THE LORD AND WHINTEY HOUSTON IS SINGING IT.

B00009W0U4|1.0|This movie is about rape. A very graphic rape happens in the movie and then there are a bunch of long, drawn out scenes that will put most to sleep. If you can handle all that, you might like it. I know they were trying to be shocking or whatever. but it was just contrived and boring. Just an opinion. I wouldn't pay $20 for it.
B00005JLEX|5.0|Seinfeld-ism? Who doesn't speak \\"Seinfeld?\\"<BR>From \\"Not that there's anything wrong with that\\" to \\"I'm out Jerry!, and I'm lov'n every minute of it!\\". <BR>Simply put, Seinfeld is the best sitcom to ever grace television. I can almost quote each episode, yet I never tire of watching the show. Put the Seinfeld Series on the shelves and watch people fight over the last boxed set. I would preorder at least 3 0r 4 boxed dvd sets right this minute if I could.
B00005J79H|2.0|Scorpions could have done a real interesting unplugged album but they sure kept things on the safe side. Even if they do \\"The zoo\\", \\"Catch your train\\" and \\"Rock you like a hurricane\\", the chosen material is mostly ballads. And the thing is that it's not exciting to hear versions that are so close to the original. Of the mentioned rock tunes, \\"Catch your train\\" is the only one that works, \\"Rock you like a hurricane\\" and \\"The zoo\\" is rather boring. What might be a treat is that Scorpions play a couple of covers (like Kansas' \\"Dust in the wind\\" and Queen's \\"Love of my life\\") but the original versions are a whole lot better. This album is only for those who are really into Scorpions.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Like many downtown NYC music lovers, I have been waiting for the release of this album. Prior to the release, I've seen Gavin DeGraw perform live four times and have always been completely blown away. If you're looking for awesome, soul-stirring lyrics, great melodies, power-filled guitar sounds, and, most importantly, fantastic piano playing, you have found the perfect CD. Gavin is a gifted songwriter and has incredible insights on life, which he magically translates into music. This CD has also got such variety, it's difficult to limit his music to a single genre. Run, don't walk, to buy this album. With all the crap out there these days, I'd say this would be the best 10 bucks you'll spend in a LONG time. Try to catch one of his shows; he sings this one song called \\"Glass\\" and Leonard Cohen's \\"Hallelujah\\" which will leave you with goosebumps.
0805062971|4.0|I'm a latecomer to the Palahniuk experience.  I also saw the movie before reading the book.  What a shame, because the book is just so much better in every possible way.  Fincher got the mood, but what about that awful ending in the movie?  The novel gets its right 100%; there is no other way for the book to end; it is, after all, a nihilist work.<br />The only minus I have against Palahniuk's writing is that it's just a bit too repetitive at times.  He reminds me of George Saunders in a way -- he's another author I can't read for too long.  The prose gets into an automatic rhythm that's just too much to take in one sitting.  Spread out in a couple of weeks, the underlying brilliance of their works overcomes their strong styles.<br />That's a tiny minus, though.  It's a rare thing that a really different book comes out.  Kudos to Palahniuk for managing to do something fresh even in this day and age.
B00006879E|5.0|Maroon5 is something very different. A Justin Timberlake of Punk rock with a little bit of retro funk mixed in. I love this album. I feel like this is a great new sound that everyone can love or at least have fun listening to their catchy melodic lines and clever lyrics. &quot;Songs About Jane&quot;, In my opinion is a must have CD for 2003.
0688163173|3.0|The only other Lehane I've read so far is Mystic River, which I loved in every possible way.  And so with much anticipation, I stepped into Shutter Island.<br />And was relieved.<br />Here was Lehane again, writing about people I recognize, writing a novel full of mystery, psychology, and violence.<br />I loved this book -- until I got almost to the end.  At that point (the &quot;twist&quot;), it did a &quot;Sixth Sense&quot; on me (or perhaps &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; is more accurate) and I was reeling.  All that intrigue, all that mystery, just gone.<br />Lehane led me to love Teddy's world too much -- and then he took it all away from me.  I know it was by design, but I can't help what I feel -- that I was cheated, taken for a ride.<br />The book makes perfect sense, no doubt about it -- but for me, on an emotional level, Shutter Island failed.

0385504209|4.0|This book wont go down as great literature, but it could potentially change the thoughts of a lot of people.  It did me.<br />The story is fairly tight and only slows down in a couple of spots.<br />Mr. Brown provides a fair amount of history, but its well worth it.  I look forward to reading some of this other books.
B000002VCT|2.0|I really don't understand the 5-star reviews on this album! It has none of the almost \\"mystic\\" yet dynamic feel of the \\"Tales...\\" album, and lacks any superb tracks such as the ones found on \\"I Robot\\". Furthermore, it seems that the APP here tries to get kinda Beatle-esque but failing to a great extent. I hope that this is not what the Beatles would have degenerated to had they continued recording into the 70s! The music sounds too pseudo-romantic and more appropriate for teenage girls of the late 70s to early 80s. The only tracks worth anything here are \\"In the lap of the Gods\\" and the album opener \\"Voyager\\". The rest are musically (but not lyrically) boring filler material and can be easily thrown away in a trash basket. For anyone wishing to find out about the genious of Alan Parsons, please do yourself a favor and get \\"Tales of Mystery...\\" and the \\"I Robot\\" albums which are far superior to \\"Pyramid\\".
B00005JKQ6|2.0|While aspects of this movie are rewarding and enjoyable, the film as a whole does not succeed. The filmmakers are to be commended for their audacious effort to adapt John Cheever's short story into a feature length film, but ultimately the directors have made woefully poor choices about what to keep - and, more significantly, what to get rid of - from the story. And those choices greatly diminish the power of the story.<br />By way of plot summary, \\"The Swimmer\\" centers on a successful Connecticut suburbanite named Neddy Merrill who one summer day decides to swim to his house through each pool in the county, thereby inventing his own \\"river\\" - a river that he names for his wife, Lucinda. The swim, of course, does not take place over the course of one day, but rather over several years and each pool represents another fall from social grace for Merrill.   <br />Unfortunately for the adaptation, the directors of this film - Frank Perry at first, followed by a young Sydney Pollack - jettison the central idea of Cheever's story: the effects of alcoholism on a robust, successful man. In the span of nine pages, the supremely gifted Cheever crafted a haunting allegory about alcoholism. Alcohol and drunkenness play a pivotal role in Cheever's story - from repeated mentions of drinks and drinking to the whole idea of \\"swimming\\" through life. Cheever's economic prose does a much better job of spanning years between swimming pools than does this movie, and the allegory to alcoholism gives the short story a central organizing principle. For whatever reason, the director(s) craft Merrill as a snob and a narcissist who over the course of the story ruins his own life, as well as the lives of others, including his wife and daughters and a young woman with whom he has an extra-marital affair. Unfortunately, we get no sense of why - or, for that matter, how - Merrill spirals downhill and takes so many others with him. This \\"swimmer\\" isn't much without the alcoholism angle.<br />In addition to the central problem that waylays the movie, there are other troubles, too. For example, the filmmakers add a relationship with a young girl that is unnecessary - except possibly to beat home the notion that each stop at a pool is a period of years, not minutes. Secondly, there is an interminable and schlocky late `60s montage scene (with the unnecessary young girl, of course) that is intended to demonstrate Neddy Merrill's vigor, but which serves only to waste time.<br />With those criticisms aired, however, the film does offer several positives. Cardinal among these is Burt Lancaster's portrayal of Merrill, which strikes the right balance between virility and vigor in the early scenes, and sadness, disillusionment, and denudation in the later scenes. It's just too bad that the filmmakers decided to do away with the alcoholism angle because based on this outstanding performance, Burt Lancaster's Neddy Merrill could have ranked up there with the most harrowing portraits of alcoholics in the history of cinema.<br />As it stands, \\"The Swimmer\\" is certainly worth a look - but not until you have read Cheever's short story, which unlike this adaptation, is transcendent.
B00005JLWN|5.0|...The opening scene took me away, the opening scene and everything goes black, people begin to get bored untill \\"It begins\\" the music i mean, i could watch this movie without any voices as the soundtrack is phenominal lifting and carrying you through the story line. The fight scenes (which i must add contain the now generic \\"Katana\\" although its acctually done write in this movie)have not a hint of bullet time due to the budget but subtle usage of occasional slow motion is all you need. Ok the idea that a man can know exactly where his enemies are at all times and never taking a scratch is a bit far fetched but if we wanted realism you shouldnt watch sci-fi. <br />The acting is awsome, Bale gives a fantastic portrayle of a blank slate being ruthlessly thrust into a bleack but colourful world. Sean Bean, one of my favourite actors is at his best although his role is small and entirely voice acted i really felt for the guy.<br />Of course there are plot holes the size of texas but its dealing with an issue that is in reality flawed so i ignor that fact and concentrate on the emotion that is so tied to the soundtrack it is precedented.<br />I could say more, but a keyboard cannot express it, oh yeah did i mention the music rules all.
0375703764|4.0|At a first glance, just flipping through the pages of House of Leaves will have you saying, \\"What the f*#@ ?!?\\" <br />Words are typed sideways, upsidedown, on top of each other... some pages are filled with only one word, and all other kinds of weird manners. All this weirdness was enough to spark my intregue to read this book. <br />What you have here is a story within a story with a story. A tattoo-shop worker named Johnny Truant discovers the papers of a deceased blind man named Zampano. Sort of like \\"The Blair Witch Project\\", Zampano's papers discuss and analyze a documentary (that might not even exist) called \\"The Navidson Record\\". This documentary, which is the main storyline of the book, is about photojournalist Navidson and his family who discover their new house is not what it seems. A mysterious door pops up out of nowhere, containing a cold, dark hallway that stretches on for hundreds of miles inside. This hallway not only piques Navidson's curiosity and scares his familiy, but also threatens to tear their family apart. <br />Throughout Zampano's paper, Johnny also puts his long footnotes in, in which he describes how this story is affecting his real life. He relates to us stories on how disturbed and detached he is becoming as he struggles to put Zampano's work together. <br />Zampano's analysis tends to get a little boring and hard to read at times. He sometimes goes off into tangents on mythology and scientific stuff. His work reads like a research paper, which it's supposed to. Hundreds of footnotes are used for fictional and real sources. Some of the footnotes seem entirely pointless; there's one that goes something like: \\"The hallway did not have windows, furnishings, curtains; nor did it have plumbing, wallpaper, carpeting...\\" and it goes on and on for a few more pages. There are quite a few more footnotes along the same line, all of which makes you wanna bang your head against the wall. Where Zampano's paper does get interesting is whenever he's describing the action of the documentary. It's this plot that carries most of the book. <br />Johnny's story does not have a lot to do with anything. You probably don't even have to read it if you don't want to. He spends his time waxing poetic on how he gets wasted and laid and eventually kinda nuts. One particular passage I loved was when he described having sex with one woman, comparing it to the forming of a dark language. It's really a beautiful metaphor. <br />I loved the visual style of this book. Like a director using various camera shots to represent what's happening in the story, whenever the hallway is explored, the pattern of the words on the page start to reflect what is happening. As Navidson crawls through an increasingly tinier passage, the paragraphs get smaller, until their is only one line left. When it is discovered how vast the mysterious hallway really is, with multiple pathways to offer, the corresponding pages are divided into numerous sections, containing many footnotes (like the one I described above) facing all sorts of directions. This leaves you feeing lost and confused like the people in the story. <br />The book kind of reminds me of DVD filled with special features and easter eggs. There's an appendix at the end of the book, containing related photographs, poetry, chapter titles, and the most entertaining of the bunch, letters from Johnny's mother. As a mental patient separated from Johnny during his childhood, her letters become increasingly more disturbing and creepy. Also, the book is filled with secrets; in one section, you can find the author's full name if you read every other letter. Also, a few lines coincide with lyrics from singer Poe's album \\"Haunted\\" (she happens to be the author's sister as well). <br />What ties everybody's storyline together? Loneliness and the dissolution of family. To me, the hallway represents the growing fear and tension between the characters that threatens to isolate them. Almost of everybody in this story was lonely to me. Navidson and his long-time girlfriend, his brother, the explorer they recruited to investigate the hallway, and even Johnny, who tried to fill his emptiness with drugs and meaningless sex. Another common tie among many of the characters was that they were abandoned by their parents. The story mentions the mythological Minotaur throughout the story (the word is always crossed out and in red in my copy), whose own father abandoned him inside a labyrinth. <br />All in all, this is a great read and a refreshingly creative way to tell the classic haunted house story.
0060920084|3.0|Bill Bryson is rather un-patriotic, which is real fun and a real pain to those who think that the States are the most beautiful, exciting and grandiose country in the world. Well, they aren't. They can be downright boring and ridiculous and tacky; as tacky as it can get. Bryson is a sarcastic travel writer, enriched by his European experience that few Americans can grasp. A very entertaining book, harsh on the American Way of Life small-town version.

B00009ATIX|1.0|A film is not boring because of who stars in it who writes it or who directs it. It's not boring because it belongs to a specific genre, is in black and white, old, new, subtitled, or over 3 hours in duration. It's not boring because it's thought provoking or mindless, looks fantastic or has a very low budget. No. For a film to attain 'boring' status it has to somehow manage to possess a very specific and unique combination of properties. To be honest I have so rarely watched a film that I could call boring and entirely without merit that I couldn't even tell you exactly what those properties are. All I can tell you is that when such a film is playing before you, you will gradually become aware of a question emanating up from the deepest depths of your brain. Quietly at first, then louder, and with increasing regularity until you have hit the 40 minute mark and it's screaming at you for action. That question is: <br />Should I turn the tv off now and rescue the next hour of my life, or will I regret not knowing what happened at the end of the film?<br />Sometimes you might reach the 40 minute point, ask this question of yourself, and you may opt to stick it out. If that happens then the film has merit - because although it may have it's flaws, it has at least hooked you just enough to not desert it. On the other hand at this particular stage a film might just be so dull, so badly scripted, badly paced, badly exectuted and altogether thoroughly disengaging - that the only course of action is to reach for that remote control before you start chewing the furniture. Ladies and Gentlemen - I give you such a film. Solaris 2002 with George Clooney. An hour and a half of eye-watering tedium. So sluggish and boring that I have even written to the Oxford Engish Dictionary to emplore them to just replace the word 'tedious' with a photo of the DVD cover. so boring that even the current word 'boring' in the english dictionary can't adequatly descrive the effect this film had onme. I really don't care whether Solaris is a planet, a sentient being, a god, or an entirely new plane of existence. I don't even care about the questions the film raises about space, technology, love, or faith. It's bored me so much that I'm too busy questioning my own faith to worry about that of those on the film. After all, how can there really be a God when honest and good people are made to suffer and endure films such as this?<br />Ok, so it looks nice. There's some spacey bits, a big swirly thing, and some metal corridors and stuff that look all shiny. I like the rain falling on the window too - that happens a couple of times. There's some nice incidental music in there also. So if that sounds like a magical hour and a half for you, you're onto a winner here - more so if you'd like a look at George Clooney's bottom. I've never seen the original (film that is, not bottom..), and unfortunately this version has ensured that I will never see it either which is a shame.

Will meets a hopelessly nerdy boy through whom he gains a slightly differed perspective on life and love.<br />Will is brilliantly played by Hugh Grant in the best performance he's given to date. Toni Colette also sparkles as the mother of Marcus. (Marcus is said hopelessly nerdy boy)<br />I loved About A Boy. The whole cast was great and the rich, humorous screenplay deservingly recieved an Oscar nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay and a Golden Globe Nomination for Best Picture (Musical or Comedy).<BR><BR>I suggest you see About A Boy. Contrary to popular belief, it's not a sappy movie or a chick-flick; just one of the best comedies of 2002!
B00006RU5B|4.0|a surprisingly rocking, accomplished disc with a full, thoughtful sound and accomplished singing and playing.<br />I must admit - I had been cynical, feeling that Cornell had lost his voice and Rage were a bunch of hypocrites (living in mansions while railing against evil Capitalism).<br />One of the most enjoyable experiences for me with music is to be pleasantly drawn in to the fold of a band. Audioslave does it well on this release.<br />Glad to see a new incarnation for all these guys!
6302787068|5.0|Certainly one of the most entertaining Disney films to date (especially for our younger audience), Aladdin is the charming tale of the Arabic &quot;street-rat&quot; who meets a genie that will grant him three wishes. When Aladdin wishes to be a prince, he tries desperately to win the heart of the beautiful Princess Jasmine.<br />The animation in this film is breathtaking, particularly the palace which Princess Jasmine lives in and the cave in which Aladdin discovers the genie's lamp. All the music in this film is great fun for the kids, and the musical numbers are surprisingly fun, not stupid.<br />Also great about Aladdin are the voices. Gilbert Godfrey and Robin Williams provide endless humor as a Eago the parrot and Genie, the genie (respectively). All of the voices, however, fit the film perfectly.<br />I loved Aladdin. It's amongst the best Disney films ever! Please go watch it! (Saddly, Disney has neglected to put it on DVD!)

B00003CXXP|3.0|A.I. is the wonderfullly-directed story of a boy who's actually not a boy but a robot. He is abandoned by his, what you might call \\"foster\\", mother because it looks as if he tried to kill his \\"brother\\". He meets friends who are like him on his journey to meet a Blue Fairy (who he believes can grant any wish) who he hopes will lead him back to the woman who abandoned him.<br />This film tempts critics to call it a masterpiece. The direction is gorgeous, the visual effects are dazzling and the scenery is an art-lover's dream-come-true. The film lacks a bit in plotting and scripting (and, let's face it, endurability), but you'll definately be enchanted by the fantastic acting of Haley Joel Osment and, once again, Steven Spielberg's ostentacious directting.<br />I'd recommend this film to you, but I would question even the hard-core Sci-Fi fanatic's ability to view A.I. more than once in its entirety. I liked it, yes... but I didn't love it for some reason.
B000002JSZ|2.0|While at this point, AC/DC had not hit their all time low in the \\"Dark Ages of Rock\\" ( the mid-80's ),it was drawing near and this shows it. With the release of \\"For Those About to Rock\\", the songs were still good, but sounded a little too similar. This album has only gotten worse,and more repetitive.AC/DC was clearly running out of ideas fast.While AC/DC did sve themselves in the early 90's with \\"The Razors Edge\\" this is just a little too low quality for AC/DC and way too repetitive,  all the songs just seem to flow together...
B00005UW9T|5.0|First of all, this film was NOT made by Disney. I can honestly say people have argued with me about this even after seeing that Fox made Anastasia. Anyways, this fabulous (yet historically inaccurate!) film about the Russian princess is a grand story that elaborates on what happened to Anastasia when the palace was siezed.<br />The animation and writing is so bright and vibrant in Anastasia, you really may be convinced Disney made this film. (Yet they didn't!)<br />Meg Ryan is fantastic in voicing the lead. The musical is also great and never really gets on your nerves like the fast majority of animated musicals. Anastasia was just great.<br />This film can be enjoyed by pretty much anyone at any age. I loved Anastasia, even though the ending and beginning were a bit weak. It was just great!
B00004RE0E|5.0|this is by far the best cd i have ever listened to. i own the cd audio version and the sacd sounds a little better. the only thing that i dont like about it is the fact that i cant copy it. Journey is a great band for thier time and their music is simply exquisite. This is the best album from this group in my opinion. <br />p.s. you can get it at bestbuy for 16.99 and nstink should get the iron maiden
B0000640VO|5.0|Within a few seconds, I was hooked to the deliciously charming film Amélie. This French film is about a shy Parisian waitress who begins to help other people in life and finds that her life has changed in a very good way.<br />Amélie is a rather strange movie, but it's hilarious, dazzling, and ultimately one of the most charming films I've ever seen. You may be a little confused by the film as your eyes are glued to the subtitles, but the images really describe the movie so if you get a chance, look up!<br />Amélie Poulain is portrayed by the adorable French actress Audrey Tautou. Other things to look for in Amélie include the film's bright script, lush cinematography, and funny special effects showing pictures and sculptures coming to life.<br />Amélie is a great feel-good film which you will want to watch again and again and again. I would recommend this film to absolutely anyone, especially a movie buff. This is by far one of the 5 best films of 2001!
0201633612|5.0|At first, I thought of this book as a little over my head since I haven't really programmed in a true object-oriented language like Java. (Creating custom objects in JavaScript is a good introduction, but concepts like subclassing, polymorphism and strong data typing can't be practiced.)<br />However, I now find as I prepare to use Java for the first time that the design patterns presented here are fairly easy to understand, and to imagine real-world applications for the examples certainly help a lot). Instead of a book to read to improve your OO skills, I'd recommend this as a *prerequisite* to OOA/OOD/OOP, something to get the cerative juices flowing about how to decompose a system into objects in a truly extensible way.<br />Of course, the best introduction to OO concepts still has to be &quot;Object-Oriented Analysis and Design&quot; by Grady Booch.
B000000WA4|5.0|I became a Smashing Pumpkins fan with this album. I got Mellon Collie in 1995 after hearing a few of the singles. I took it home and never stopped listening! The album ranges from beautiful, quiet, disarming melodies to raw hard angst-filled rock. As a loose concept album, it flows perfectly. The first CD Dawn to Dusk contains many of the \\"lighter\\" songs like \\"Cupid De Locke\\" and \\"Galapagos\\" as well as the beautiful piano instrumental \\"Mellon Collie & the Infinite Sadness\\". CD1 also contains the rockers \\"Zero\\" and \\"Bullet with Butterfly Wings\\" and the best song to listen to when you're [angry] \\"An Ode to No One\\". CD2 Twlight to Starlight breaks out a few hard rockers too like \\"Where Boys Fear to Tread\\" (which actually uses a sample from the hit game \\"Doom\\"), \\"Tales of a Scorched Earth\\" and \\"X.Y.U.\\" these songs hit you like a ton of bricks pounding at your head urging you to ROCK! CD2 also contains some of the bands best work with \\"Beautiful\\", \\"1979\\" and \\"Farewell and Goodnight\\" (which shows the talent of this band as ALL members take a part and sing in this song including the bassist D'arcy and drummer Jimmy). Twilight also contains the haunting \\"Stumbeliene\\" a solo effort featuring just Billy and an acoustic guitar fighting his inner demons and fears all in one song. This album has a song for your every mood, from anger to love and pain to pure happiness (see Cupid De Locke). If you loved Siamese Dream, you will love this CD. It shows how the band has grown musically and lyrically. You can't compare it to any of their previous or post albums, Mellon Collie stands on its own. Beautiful work from a band that is very very talented. People tend to over look Jimmy, James and D'arcy's talent, but this album is a showcase for it all. \\"In the Arms of Sleep\\" is another song that is enough to make me cry, slow, haunting and most of all its about love. Get this album now!!
0688163173|5.0|After the complex, troubling &quot;Mystic River&quot; I was concerned that Lehane would return to the fairly-unimpressive Kenzie/Gennaro sreies which first put him on the map. Instead he delivers an equally complex, troubling book, but one that is about as different from &quot;Mystic River&quot; as could be.<br />&quot;Shutter Island,&quot; had me by the throat from the first chapter and never let go until the final haunting page. Part detective thriller, part horror story, the book moves at a breakneck pace, while serving up crackling dialogue and hairpin twists. &quot;Mystic River&quot; clearly wasn't a fluke, and if his hot streak continues, Lehane may yet emerge as one of the best crime writers of the new millennium.
B000053VAF|5.0|You want a good laugh?  Get this movie - it doesn't matter what religion you are, you will have a good time and this movie is the &quot;bomb&quot;!  If you don't know Jay and Silent Bob, Rent Clerk and Mallrat, both a classic.   <br />This movie makes you think, cry at time and laugh most of all.  Not at religions, not at God, just a good laugh, great actors.<br />And Buddy Jesus is there to make you SMILE!
B000002HMH|5.0|I just listened to this CD for the first time in years, only to compare it with St. Anger...and guess what? I LOVED IT!!! I have to admit, they were before their time with &quot;Load&quot;, just listen and you'll know what I mean. Metallica practically invented alternative music. The Metallica-sound began to disappear already on the black album and disappointed a lot of fans. But agree with me, they are a heck of a lot more disappointed with St. Anger? I'm proud to be a Metallica fan, but the new album will NOT be spinnin' in my player. But &quot;Load&quot; will!
B0000640SA|4.0|So you go to the movie, you see it, you're already thinking about a zillion ending.......here, you already know the ending, you just need to find the beginning which IS the ending.  Make sense?  Not, GOOD!!  That's the whole point of the movie, you DON'T know what's going to happend because like the hero of the movie, YOU don't know ANYTHING!  It's a great movie, not for ... the I-Can't-follow-kinda of viewers.  Acting is great.  Fresh new face, fresh new style.

B00009ATIX|3.0|Though the story concept is very creative, the writers could have explored the scenes further.  It's missing many of the characters' emotions.  The emotions that are expressed by the actors do wonderful, especially George Clooney and Natascha McElhone.  The bearded man's life was irrevilent to the movie, but he's interesting sometimes.  The visual effects of the ship and Solaris are great.  It wasn't overly done like most other special effects-based movies.<br />The combination of science fiction and drama is very creative.  Though production and direction needs more effort to perfect this cross-genre, it opened doors for other movie producers and writers.  Though Steven Soderborgh's best remains \\"Traffic\\", he directs \\"Solaris\\" wonderfully.
B0000AUHOH|3.0|Star TRek V is considered by most as the worst entry of the film series, I disagree on that point, I think insurrection is!<BR>Anyway... I am looking forward to getting the special editionof Star Trek V, I am big on special features and have collectedthe first four films in the double disk format already.  I learn may interesting facts about the film and the TEXT commentaries are GREAT... I am especially looking forward to the special edition release of my personal favorite \\"Old Crew\\" film Star Trek VI and I am patient enough to enjoy V for a while. Hey ITS A TREK FILM none the less...
B00008DDXL|5.0|The second is even better than the first. Loads of excietment and adventure, with an excellent plot. The movie stays true to the book, any fan would be proud. The DVD is topped with loads of even more extra stuff, including activities, extra scenes, interviews and a DVD-Rom bonus. I can't wait till the third one comes out!
B00002R0MC|5.0|I bought this collection wondering if it was possible for all 75+ songs to be good. i was right, all are not good. every sigle song on this collection is Superb. Its music at the highest degree, absolute class. Despite this having four Cd's it could have had even more marley songs on it to prove how great Bob is.<BR>CD 1 is the older, more Raw marely stlye from the rude boy era and the collection develops into the more modern Marley ending with his live performance of Redemption Song in Pittsburgh is his last concert ever.<BR>I can lsiten to this every day and not get fed up of it.Plus the recording quality of these CD's are top notch and the book is superb also.<BR>This surely is the greatest compilation ever and well worth the money for it.
B00004Z459|5.0|I really, really love Linkin Park.  Mostly I'm a classic rock fan, but man, I'm so into LP's mood.  I love that they don't use crude language at all.  I liked all of the songs except for &quot;Points of Authority,&quot; which felt too construed, and &quot;By Myself,&quot; which was almost a little boring.  Everything else I think is great, especially &quot;Cure for the Itch,&quot; which has no real lyrics, but is refreshing because of it.  &quot;In The End&quot; (which I dig but I'm totally sick of it now) is on this CD, but I completely forgot about it after I got into all the other songs.  &quot;Place for my Head&quot; is doubtless my favorite.<br />Linkin Park's style of mixing rap with melodic lyrics, while still managing to pay adequate attention to the instrumental music, is what really draws me to them.  They are soooo above today's musical standard for their genre.  This is a wonderful beginning for someone who's just getting into Linkin Park.
B000002U82|5.0|I've listened to the major acts in music history such as The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, The Who, Jimi Hendrix, U2, The Beach Boys, etc. but no other album has left a stronger impression on me than Pink Floyd's astonishing masterpiece \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\". This is without doubt the best piece of music I've ever heard.<br />The Beatles' \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" might have been the pioneer of the concept album, but Pink Floyd redefined and perfectioned it with this crowning achievement.<br />\\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" is the definition of a true album because it is more of a long piece than a collection of songs. It is one long glorious symphony that from the first heartbeats of \\"Speak To Me\\" to the climatic finale \\"Eclipse\\", it is nothing short of mesmerizing. The songs flow one to another with the most expert cohesiveness and structure, while at the same time it lyrically and sonically goes on the most exhilarating musical journey through the human psyche, exploring the aspects of everyday life such as time, money, division, war, greed, insanity, aging and death and how they mold, shape and what they mean to us as individuals.<br />The album is also magnificently produced. The multilayered, textured sound effects create an involving and rich ambience that immediately sucks you in, and even enhance the themes the album is working with (The ticking clocks in \\"Time\\" and the cash registers in \\"Money\\" are still innovative by today's standards). Musically, \\"Dark Side\\" is as beautiful and breathtaking as it can get. The album's cosmic, surreal sound landscapes and its soothing, hypnotic pace are so delightful that they get planted in your ears and your brain.<br />\\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" is more than an album, it's an experience. It's a work of art and one of the most important contributions to music in the 20th century. The proof of its impact is out there. 14 consecutive years in the charts and more than 35 million copies sold. It's an albumfor the senses, the mind, the heart and soul. Simply put, \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" is the best album ever made.
B00006JIA4|4.0|If you don't like amazing, brilliant rock, this band is not for you!  CD 1 seems to be a mix of faster and slower songs, and I much prefer the faster ones (i.e. Killer Queen, Another One Bites the Dust) to the slower ones (Best Friend, Somebody to Love).  On CD 2, I love all of the songs.  I play it all the way through without skippin' anything.<br />CD 3, on the other hand...<br />It's supposed to be a CD of remixes done by various artists.  Well, most of them, in my opinion, are not worth the effort, and you aren't likely to find them entertaining if you're not a diehard Queen fan.  If you aren't, you would probably be better off buying Greatest Hits 1 and 2 separately.  If you just want the more famous songs (you know, the ones that you loved but never knew were Queen?) like &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; and &quot;Another One Bites the Dust&quot; just buy CD 1.

B00006IX0R|4.0|This hits collection is just about as good as it could be. I would have liked to have a few more moody songs like &quot;I Still Do&quot; or &quot;Dreaming my Dreams&quot;, but at 20 tracks, it's hard to complain. &quot;Shattered&quot; and &quot;Dying Inside&quot; would have been good too. But this has definitely got the pop hits covered. &quot;Dreams&quot;, &quot;Zombie&quot;, &quot;Free to Decide&quot;, and &quot;Animal Instinct&quot; are all here. The two new songs are good as well. If you're someone looking for your first, or only &quot;Cranberries&quot; cd, &quot;Stars&quot; is the one to get. It will go great with your &quot;Sinead O'Connor&quot; and &quot;U2&quot; best of's.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS THE GREATEST WESTERN EVER MADE AND ONE OF THE TOP FILMS EVER MADE!!!
0312263120|4.0|I think that one of the most interesting facets of this novel is to see Dan Brown's writing evolve. This was his first real novel, and it was rather more simplistic in certain ways than his later novels. That is not to say that it is a bad book; it is excellent and well worth the price of admission. However, the characterizations are not quite as rich, the plots are a bit easier to see through, and so on. This is not necessarily a bad thing, it is just that Mr. Brown had not fully developed his style as a professional writer yet.<br />This novel was about cryptographers and teachers. Much as always, geeks are the heroes in this work, and they are good ones at that. Mr. Brown seems to be quite interested in secrets and also in teaching them to others. All four of his most popular books (Digital Fortress, Deception Point, Angels and Demons, and The Da Vinci Code) center on rather covert agencies and ideas and in all of them there is a pedagogical figure who is interested in explaining to others the secrets and how they are kept. <br />In the end, this novel follows the general pattern of all of his and of all action-suspense works. It is a fairly well-defined genre. However, the joy in Mr. Brown's work is not in its inherent originality; rather, it is in learning new things (which happens for most of us with each of his books...he has a rather esoteric collection of wisom and makes some positively strange and delightful connections), watching the geeks save the day, and seeing the characters live up to their potentials. <br />Much like his other books, this is a great work, and it is definately worthwhile. If you read only one book this month, read this book. (I have difficulties with the conception that the average American reads one book each year...). Buy it, read it, enjoy it, and share it. <br />Lovely book, Mr. Brown. Great stuff. Keep it up.<BR>Harkius
0385504209|5.0|As a literature teacher married to a theologian, I've often been accused by friends of &quot;seeing things that were not there.&quot; (symbology).  Now, as a result of reading The DaVinci Code, not only can I gloat that I am aware of more symbols than the average person, I also know there's a name for those who study symbols, (symbologist).  One of the nicest things a sixth-grade student wrote about me was, &quot;Mrs. *** LOVES words, and she knows how to use them.&quot;  As a word lover and lover of symbology, I was enthralled with the story.  His subtle sense of humor and discreet allusion is not to be missed either. Often I'd find myself laughing out loud.  Bravo!
B000046PVN|5.0|I have been impressed John Williams' entire body of work, however I have always felt that Superman or Schindler's list were his greatest works and perhaps the greatest soundtracks ever composed.  The original versions of the Superman soundtrack were inadequate representations of the richness and  beauty of the movie's music.  I am overjoyed that this CD at last brings out the true genius of pieces that were previously unavailable.  Of particular note are the previously unheard versions of The Planet Krypton and The Death of Jonathan Kent (the latter being one of the most moving pieces ever written for the screen).  If you are a Superman fan, or just love great music, get this CD.  It is well worth it!

Her love live is still complicated and confusing as she is torn between Ranger and Morelli. But Morelli wants marriage and for her to settle down and quit the business and she isn't about to do that so that relationship is on the backburner. Ranger has yet to collect on his debt from the last book (Seven Up) and while she does want him to collect she is afraid of what the experience has in store for her when he does.<br />Professionally, she is still working for her cousin Vinnie and apprehending failure to appears so that he does not have to pay off on the bonds. But, the bond business has added a new wrinkle-child custody bonds. She hasn't heard of them before and as the book opens, finds out about their existence from Mabel, the grandmother that owns the other half of the duplex where Stephanie's parents live. Mabel put up her house to guarantee the bond of her daughter, Evelyn. Evelyn and her ex husband, Steven Soder, have a daughter named Annie. Now Annie and Evelyn have disappeared and the shady Steven wants the money guaranteed by the bond so that he can ostensibly look for his daughter.<br />True Blue Bonds Bail Agency is going after the house and Mabel is beside herself with grief and worry about her family as well as the prospects of losing her house. While Stephanie wants to stay out of it, Grandma Mazur is insisting that she help. Stephanie agrees and with the deadline fast approaching to find her or lose the house, she begins the search.<br />She begins looking and while she does not find them, she soon discovers that somehow the psychotic Eddie Abruzzi is involved. While the connection isn't clear, the wreckage left in his wake is and he has declared her part of the enemy as he wages war to find Evelyn and her daughter Anne. At the same time she is working this case for free, she is supposed to deal with the problem of the violent drunk Andy Bender again as well as several other cases. But those pale in comparison as the psychotic Eddie Abruzzi steps up the pressure on her as she experiences his personal obsession.<br />Number eight in the series sheds no new light on Stephanie or her character. She is still fumbling around, making the same mistakes that she made in book one with outrageous consequences. On one hand it is comfortable reading because there are no new surprises and the characters for the most part all act the same. There is nothing new here and certainly nothing to rattle the comfort level of the reader by suddenly killing off a favorite character or something as so many authors are want to do.<br />On the other hand, much of this has been done before and one expects most folks to learn something from their past. For example, when one knows a psycho is stalking, it is best to have bullets in the gun beforehand no matter how much one does not like guns. Does she? Of course not. With psychos and henchmen constantly after her as well as blowing up her latest car (she has always had a hard time with cars) she walks around without her gun.<br />If this was a person in real life, it would drive one nuts. Chronically stupid is not an endearing quality and it would be nice if Stephanie would be a little less neurotic and a little smarter after all this time.of the violent drunk Andy Bender again as well as several other cases.

B00004XQ83|5.0|Every so often old time music has resurfaced in the American conciousness, and this CD was the vehicle for its most recent occurrence.  What a wonderful return to the days when the worst that could happen brought out the best in the people it happened to.  The music of our parents and grandparents gets the tribute it deserves.<br />On the technical side, this CD is crafted with the same care and attention to detail that was given to the movie.  The album notes are informative and entertaining.  However, the real surprise comes when you put this CD into your computer.  Any screen saver that lets you shoot cows and watch a flooded valley pass before your eyes has my vote!  My thanks to the Coen brothers for once again making us smile with their unique perspective of the world.
B0000A1RJI|4.0|Overall, I feel that this is a decent CD, with a few flaws. <BR>Several of the main themes borrow or are inspired by themes from &quot;The Rock&quot; or &quot;Gladiator&quot;.  Generally, I dislike unoriginal music, but it does not seem to be a big problem for this CD.  The music is unique enough that a good ear will be able to tell the difference in the themes.<BR>Another disappointment for me is that the music does not sound as &quot;full&quot; as it did in the theater.  (Perhaps this will be the motivation to invest in a surround-sound system)  I feel that this loss in fullness is due to the reliance on synthetics.  I also feel that the soundtrack would have benefited from a full orchestra, with minimal synthetic involvment.<BR>I was also disappointed with the length of the soundtrack.  Most movie soundtracks are around an hour; this CD is approx. 45 minutes long.<BR>The music uses the movie's humor to its advantage; there are several cues that play up the grandeur of a scene (the best example is Jack Sparrow's entrance), and I feel enhance the enjoyment of said scene.  Using the Jack Sparrow's entrance example, I doubt that scene would be as funny if there was no music or music that did not exude the excitement/granduer/nobility that the current music does.<BR>While flawed, the CD is enjoyable enough to buy.  Obviously not on the same playing field as &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; or other similar greats, the soundtrack is a diamond in the rough that deserves a look.
B000003NA4|5.0|With a voice as smooth as 25 year old Scotch and a truly unique interpretive style, Diana Krall's Love Scenes is a must have album.  True, there are some Jazz Nazi's addicted to a style that has been out of vogue for 50 years that may disagree.  However, if your musical taste tends toward the eclectic, and your idea of relaxation involves a fireplace, adult beverages and wonderful music, then this is definitely for you.
B00001U0GQ|2.0|This is a terrible DVD. If you want the movie, buy the VHS version instead. Want to know why? Just read the other DVD reviews below. I don't think I need to repeat what everyone else has said already. What a major disappointment. I'm still waiting for a REAL director's expanded edition of this great movie.
B0000024W3|4.0|i was pretty suprised when i saw that a lot of people were unimpressed and considered this album a joke.  i've had this one for about 2 years and i enjoy it.  when i saw it at my local record store, i was impressed with the amount of songs as well as the songs themselves.  its interesting to see what kind of spin he puts on classics (the violin on blue moon is nice).  i guess the bottom line is it gives me a homey country feel, and the country pics in the liner notes don't hurt.
B000000WJZ|5.0|I hadnt been exposed to much of the Pumpkins stuff prior to purchasing this album, I knew the basic sound because I had heard a few tracks from &quot;Mellon Collie&quot;, I frear this may have ruined it. I thought most of the tracks on this cd were inferior to those that I had already heard from &quot;Mellon Collie&quot; song like &quot;Bullet with Butterfly Wings&quot; seemed far better than &quot;Cherub Rock&quot; and &quot;Mayonaise&quot;. I continue to listen to this cd to try and see if maybe I didnt give it enough time to fully sink in. Hopefully I will grow to like it more than I do now. Anyways if you have already heard &quot;Mellon Collie&quot; than I would say skip this, because that album is far superior, unless you just wanted another SP album.

This is a dark twisted comedy, but its really funny and it gets better each time u watch it.  There's even a annual festival for this movie it some states,  how cool is that!!    IF U ENJOYED MOVIES LIKE:  The WOnder Boys  Fear and Loathing Las Vegas  u will LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie  what more can i say    This has to be in the top 10 for best comedy ever made.  All those people that gave this movie a bad review  if u read their reviews, they dont like any good movies.  This is true classic that everyone needs in their collection.
B00000JZI9|5.0|I have mixed emotions about this western because it seems to combine just about all the elements of entertainment except Ethel Merman out in the street, singing \\"Silverado, It's a Helluva Town!\\" while Fosse-trained dangers prance around her. Several people die in this film. Others are brutally beaten. There is at least one victim of racial discrimination. And yet we encounter substantial humor which is sometimes hilarious. Sheriff Monty Python makes a brief appearance in the form of John Cleese. The acting is superb. The plot proceeds expeditiously to an inevitable confrontation. No loose ends. Director Lawrence Kasdan and his brother Mark co-authored an action-filled script which is uncommonly literate. John Bailey's cinematography is superb. No single performance stands out because all are outstanding. Great casting. Of special interest to me is Kevin Costner's portrayal of Jake, a happy-go-lucky gunslinger. I wish Costner had demonstrated comparable energy and enthusiasm in subsequent roles. Obviously, the Kasdans love westerns. Obviously, their cast and crew had a jolly time making this film. After seeing it again recently, however, I appreciated more than I had before the undertone of seriousness.<br />What to make of all this? Frankly, I encourage everyone to relax and enjoy it.

Bad Girl, This Used To Be My Playground, You'll See, I'll Remember, You Must Love Me, Nothing Really Matters, and of course Rain!!!  What makes this greatest hits album so different the Immaculate Collection is I.C. has all of Madonna's hits from the 80's (except Who's That Girl and Dress You Up, but that's besides the point.)  Sure, it has great songs like Secret and Music, but the edits are horrible!  Erotica is one of my all time favorites and it's cut a minute short.  My recommendation?  Get all of her 90's and 00's albums, those would be your best bet for satisfaction.  I think the only good thing on this album are the pictures!
B000006MS3|5.0|The Dreaming, or as my friends and I in the early 80s dubbed it \\"The Screaming\\", is Kate's most fully realized work. She herself has said it was emotionally wrenching to produce, and that emotional intensity comes through consistently on every track. In fact, I think this is the most emotionally intense music ever made with synthesizers. Constructed essentially with just her Fairlight (with some additional instruments added as textures), her voice sequenced in and out, she was able to construct a psycho-sonic landscape that conjured a state of mind and spirit in a state of high tumult with no promise of redemption. <br />On vinyl, the two sides of this masterpiece were reflections of one another, each track a mirrored response to its counterpart on the opposite side. The conscious search for knowledge on \\"Sat in your Lap\\" was answered by the unconscious revelations of \\"The Dreaming\\"; the heist gone wrong on \\"There Goes a Tenner\\" became a flight from the cops on \\"Night of the Swallow\\", and so on; culminating in the expressionist screams that close both sides: \\"Leave It Open\\", with its take-all-comers approach to experiencing what life throws at you, is contrasted with the get-the-hell-out-and-don't-ever-come-back she-mule of \\"Get Out Of My House\\". Kate new exactly what she was doing from beginning to end. In the making of this record - the first one of hers that she produced herself -- she demonstrated a remarkably confident command of art and technology, and this all coming from a 22-year-old.<br />The dynamics and textures used on The Dreaming were developed on it predecessor, Never for Ever, and mastered on its follow-up, Hounds of Love, but never were they as evocatively employed as on this album. The soaring circles of her voice, the pipes, and Fairlight treatment on Night of the Swallow are literally breathtaking. I could go on and on. This work changed the way I listed to popular music two decades ago. To listen to this music now, over 20 years after it was recorded, is to still be transported onto romantic flights and dreams. Search. Theft. Escape from bondage. In dreams begin responsibilities. It is best listened to after midnight.
B00006IUL2|4.0|Pasolini fans have been struggling with low-quality DVD's since the advent of the format, and Medea is no exception.  This disc, put out by Vanguard, is certainly a step above the Wellspring and Image Pasolini DVD's, but that really isn't saying much.  The transfer is fairly dirty and washed-out, and the sound is very hissy.  The punctuation in the subtitles is abominable. That being said, they are actually quite easy to read.<br />The film itself is good, although it doesn't reach the heights of Pasolini's earlier Oedipus Rex.  The film is very slow, lacking a great deal of dialogue, until it explodes at the very end.  It's a little convaluted, and I highly advise reading a summary of the story before delving into the film.<br />While Medea isn't Pasolini's best film, it's certainly not his worst DVD.  Worth a rental, at least.
0425107469|5.0|Koontz is AMAZING! This novel is AMAZING! I don't think i can express it clearly enough for everyone to understand just how spellbinding this book is! Koontz writes his characters (even the nonhuman ones) SO well that you'll find it impossible to put it down! If you have ever heard anything about ANY of the movie versions of this book QUICKLY forget them! They were depressingly awful and I believe that they should all be destroyed...BUT THIS NOVEL IS OUTSTANDING! READ IT! NOW!
B0000026T4|5.0|HI folks I am an Alice cooper fan from India.Well alice cooper is my all time favourite and this is my best alice cooper album.Songs like &quot;poison&quot;, &quot;house on fire&quot; are all time hits filled with heavy duty guitar lead breaks.So if you are into Alice cooper,UFO,etc. then this is a must buy record.
B00009RDG9|4.0|THE HUNTED has been scorned as a predictable thriller.  But then most thrillers are 'predictable' by the time the critics review them.  The question is &quot;Will this 'predictable' movie entertain&quot;?  YES!  William Friedkin knows how to pace his action movies and this one is no exception.  Tommy Lee Jones is his usual (read 'predictably') fine acting self and Benecio Del Toro gives further evidence that he is a major talent.  Both characters, co-participants in a deadly and bloody 'hunt/hunter' tale, are well developed, nuanced, and terrific to watch.  Ease up on the fact that you know who is going to win and just settle in to a fine action/psychodrama movie.
0385504209|4.0|this is a surpisingly easy book to read in spite of it's heady material.  It is very easy to get onboard w/ Brown's premise particularly if you do a little digging of your own and it is about time bibilical, art and religous history  are given more than &quot;mueseum&quot; treatment.  Pass it along to others, it is a boolk that begs to be discussed.
B0000931QR|5.0|Some of the most beautiful melodies I have heard in years.  The songs are very catchy yet have original hooks and special melody-notes that make them last long.  The songwriting is impecable as well as the production.  If you like music with melancholy as well as very melodic feeling that get to your spine with anthemic chills  (I.E. ABBA, Mecano, Mylene Farmer, Eros Ramazzotti, Cardigans, Fey, Shakira, Juanes), you will love this album.  The choruses are amazing!  Listen to: Vestido Azul, Tu y Yo, La Paz de Tus Ojos!  They will WOW you!  La Oreja de Van Gogh's at their BEST!
B00005AKQE|5.0|This CD is perhaps my favorite out of all the ones I own.  The 2nd CD is particularly great.  &quot;Is This The End?&quot; is probably my favorite Creed song, if not my favorite song, period.  It's so powerful, even moreso than &quot;Higher&quot;, &quot;With Arms Wide Open&quot;, and the multitude of other singles Creed has put out.  It's a shame these types of CDs aren't issued in the US, but that they must be imported from around the world.  A must-have for ANY Creed fan (especially if you don't own &quot;Human Clay&quot; already!).
0792165020|5.0|This is by far one of my favorite movies of the 90's. It truly has everthing - gorgeous scenery, amazing actors, mystery, and glamour. Jude Law is flawless as Dickie Greenleaf, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman is divine as Freddie Miles. All the characters in this movie are very entertaining. The costumes and the Italian backdrop make this movie total eye candy. If you love cozy Hitchcock movies, you'll love The Talented Mr. Ripley.
630018403X|5.0|There were several classic Teen Comedies that came out in the 80's, many including the infamous &quot;Brat Pack&quot; but The Breakfast Club tops them all. Five high schoolers find themselves stuck in Saturday Detention with nothing to do but talk to each other. Although it is hard to relate to one character in particular, (One was a jock, one a prom queen, one a basketcase, one a nerd and one a criminal), by the end it was easy to realte to all the characters as a whole. Although my taste in movies ranges from heavy dramas to pointless comedies, I feel this movie is a happy median. People of all ages can enjoy The Breakfast Club, and its humor is bound to make everybody laugh at least a couple of times while watching.<BR>     If you have already seen this movie, I reccomend St.Elmo's Fire which has 3 of the five TBC stars in it, Sixteen Candles which stars the other two, and Pretty in Pink.
B00005QGAV|5.0|Michael Jackson aka King of Pop does it again! Every time he makes a cd it's always great! If you would like to compare this cd Thriller, here's the verdict: you can't. This cd is way different than &quot;Off the Wall&quot; or &quot;Thriller&quot; you could however, compare this cd to &quot;Bad.&quot; &quot;Dangerous&quot; has a lot of upbeat songs.<BR> <BR>1. Jam- a fast working song with a nice selection of instruments.<BR>2. Why you wanna trip on me- an upbeat song that is great to dance to.<BR>3. In the closet- A medium/fast song that has a very nice tune.<BR>4. She drives me wild- A very nice dancing song!<BR>5. Remember the time- Yet another upbeat song that is great to sing along to.<BR>6. Can't leat her get away- One of the less upbeat songs. <BR>7. Heal the world- A medium/slow song that is great to sing along to.<BR>8. Black or White- An upbeat song that tons of people love!<BR>9. Who is it- A very original medium/slow song. Love it!<BR>10. Give in to me- One of MJ's more rock kind of song. Lots of feeling in it.<BR>11. Will you be there- A song made for the move &quot;Free Willy.&quot;<BR>12. Keep the Faith- A very encouraging song for when you are down in the dumps. It makes you feel better!<BR>13. Gone too soon- A very touching song. Slow and touching :`(.<BR>14. Dangerous- One of the more fun and upbeat songs on the cd.<br />I've had this cd for a year and a few months. If you don't get it, you're really missing out!
0446677450|3.0|Once again another book telling Americans how to get rich. May I make a suggestion? One of the best ways to get rich is to write a book on how to get rich & rake in those sales receipts.<br />I have some serious problems with this book. For a start there is incredible verbatim reproduction of conversations this author supposedly had as a 9 year old kid in the late 1950s. With a memory like that he's already incredible, or he made detailed notes at the time, or he's making it up. Hmmm, tricky one to call isn't it?<br />Next there is the usual hype of being self employed. Neatly it sidesteps the well known facts of life regarding self employment; going into business for yourself is one of the best ways of losing money known to man. No one would take $25,000 & bet it all on black at the roulette table & yet time after time people seem to think that starting a bussiness with similar amounts of money is a good idea. Yet the odds aren't that much different. I also know people who drive around all their life without wearing a seatbelt, convinced that they don't need to do so because they're a good driver. Most of the time they get away with it, of course you can imagine what happened to the rest of them.<br />For those who manage to get self employment to work for them that's fine, but it is a self fulfilling philosophy. They believe it will work & feel vindicated when it does. But they forget that plenty of others now living in trailer parks also believed it would work. I know self employed people who never make a profit, or struggle for years on end, even one who lost all his money, his house, his car, his marriage & everything he had. He lost so badly he never recovered (15 years later he's still pretty much broke) & probably never will. Yet he was regarded as astute & likely to succeed! He was taken down by factors no one expected & didn't see coming. Such is the world of self employment, populated with a few rich people but mainly full of those who've failed.<br />Financial awareness, frugality, investing & plain common sense are good messages. Too often the advertising of modern America pushes us to consume beyond the ability of our personal finances to sustain (buy this if you want to be happy! SPEND! SPEND!), with painful results. This is an important point that must be learned & this book covers these ideas, but insufficiently.<br />However if everyone followed the advice of this book no one would work for anyone else. We would have no factories, meaning no US made cars, ships, aircraft or electronics. Bridges would be imported, we would have incredibly expensive fuel prices as small business man after small business man made up the production, refining, distribution & retail chain instead of the super efficient system we have today (regardless of other issues it is efficient). <br />Lastly there is the usual Looney Right Wing moaning about taxes. This sounds incredibly selfish & out of touch after the events of 9/11, the firefighters, police & ambulence of this country don't get paid enough. Where does the money come from? Taxes! People don't want to pay taxes but they still want their services & security & they want it NOW MISTER! It is begining to make me sick listening to this kind of tripe.<br />It is not as if \\"cutting taxes\\" saves you any money. As has been pointed out if you save $500 a year in taxes but the police get cut & you have to spend $1000 on house, car & personal security sytems, what's the point? It is the same if schools get cut & you end up spending $5,000+ a year PER CHILD on private education for your kids so they can get decent schooling. A pity this book doesn't cover that! But then the self centered Right Wing of this country never likes to talk about such things.<br />Again this is a book that is basically sound in some of the advice it offers, but fundamentaly flawed in it's outlook.
B000089RVX|5.0|it's like beautiful painting translated into music, all the words will linger with for a long time, you'll be humming pieces throughout the rest of the week, you have to get this album you are missing so much if you don't. i'm one of those peopl who rarely buys albums because they are so expensive but this one is worth every cent you spend

B00004ZAV3|5.0|If you're a longtime Beatles fan with all the albums (including the Past Masters Volumes I and II) then this isn't a collection for you. If, however, you're a casual listener, a new fan just getting interested in the Beatles, or an old fan getting reacquainted with your favorite hits from the '60s, then this is an excellent collection for you. Almost every significant single the Beatles ever released is contained on a generous single-disc compilation. <br />I can attest to this album kindling my interest in the Beatles. I'm a teenager who was always been mildly interested in them, knowing some of their songs, humming them occasionally, but after listening to this album it became a full-blown love affair. Since then, I've bought all the albums from Rubber Soul through Let it Be and have downloaded many of their other songs onto my computer. <br />I do agree with some other reviewers that there are tons of great songs missing, including (but not limited to), \\"Strawberry Fields,\\" \\"Rain,\\" \\"Revolution,\\" \\"Please Please Me,\\" \\"All My Loving,\\" \\"A Day in the Life,\\" \\"Across the Universe,\\" and of course everything from the White Album. Had I been in charge of making this album, I probably wouldn't have limited it to #1's. I would have included \\"Please Please Me,\\" \\"Strawberry Fields,\\" \\"Revolution,\\" and even \\"Rain,\\" and left off \\"The Ballad of John and Yoko,\\" \\"Eight Days a Week,\\" \\"The Long and Winding Road,\\" and \\"Yellow Submarine\\" (all good songs, but nowhere near as good as the others I mentioned). But, hey, it works as it is and hopefully it'll introduce people to the Beatles sound and get them so that they'll hear the other songs I've mentioned and countless other great works by The Beatles.
B00009MGQL|3.0|As a long time Jeff Beck fan, I was happy to see Jeff back out on the streets and with a new CD in fairly short order.  The CD does not break any new ground and covers the same turf that Jeff has been spinning his wheels in for a few years now.  Jeff said he was NOT happy with this record and is/has returned with &quot;Guitar Shop&quot; line up again for live shows.  I am not so sure Jeff is ever happy with a product he has already recorded and put behind him.  Jeff is (usually) onto soemthing new.  The CD does tend to fall into grooves that were done elsehwere and then shipped over to Jeff to add his wondeful playing. The Apollo 440 tracks sound, well, like Apollo 440 tracks. Nothing innovative and special.<br />Jeff needs to open up another door and not go backwards.  That being said, I am always glad to wake up everyday in a world where Jeff Beck exists!
6304169558|4.0|There are three stars in \\"Twister\\": the obsessed, almost vindictive woman who wants to defeat tornadoes, the obsessed, ingenious man determined to thwart tornadoes with technology - and the American Corn Belt, where superfluous humans and their artifacts are scrubbed from the landscape every year by tornadoes. Although they're not alone in chasing twisters, the Paxton/Hunt team is the focus of the movie - and this team is no bunch of Evian-swilling Sierra Club wimps. One of the best scenes shows the team stopping for a quick (feast) of steak, eggs, mashed potatoes, and gravy (\\"Meg's gravy is famous - it's practically a food group\\") at Hunt's character's aunt's home, right slap in the middle of Tornado Alley. The professional camaraderie in this team is wonderful, especially when we see how the members of the other team (led by Cary Elwes) don't get along so much as they get in line. (Critic Emerson will probably be played by Elwes the same way, if anyone ever makes a movie of his life.) By the way, I bought a copy of the soundtrack album - and then threw it away: none of the wonderful, driving original music is on the CD!
B00000K3D4|5.0|I saw this film in the theater as a child, and nearly 20 years later (wow!) this is still the best fantasy film for children I've ever seen.  It also inspired my love for the artwork of Brian Froud.  The sets and characters are still more impressive than most of the CGI-laden stuff that is produced for kids to watch now, and the story has an important moral.  David Bowie is a perfect fantasy villain; he's dark and creepy yet also a little vulnerable and appealing.  Jennifer Connelly has come a long way with her acting, but she still fills the role of a teenage girl who tries to keep adulthood at bay by immersing herself in the world of fantasy she loved since childhood very well.  This movie is beautiful and dark, funny and scary, and an absolute classic for every family to treasure!
B00003CXIP|5.0|Stand By Me has gotta be one of the best films ever to be made! not only do i love the storyline but i love the film even more because quite a few of my fave actors are in it! (River Phoenix, Corey Feldman, Wil Wheaton, Kiefer Sutherland, Bradley Gregg, John Cusack) This film brings out all different emotions from deep inside of me! i would definately recommend this film to ANYONE! most of my friends love it too! also the extra features are brilliant...everything on the DVD is brilliant...if you are thinking of buying this film...i suggest you DO! it'll be worth every penny!!! :)
B00009RDG9|2.0|Rambo meets The Fugitive and they both lose! Yes we've seen it all before and better. And it isn't laughably bad enough to qualify as camp. It did come close though when the adversaries stop in the middle of a life and death chase to make weapons; Tommy Lee goes native long enough to knap a flint knife as Benicio uses his blacksmithing skills to forge a blade. Jones and Del Toro are wasted in roles that lack development. The biggest question is, if these great talents take on such puny roles what are actors like Stallone and Tom Berenger going to do?
B00002MZ2C|5.0|My first Rage cd. This right here is what got me into music, and made it real for me. This cd is a classic. Every single song is amazing incitful and motivating. this is Rage.
0345357116|5.0|This was a real surprise for this fanatic who read The Hobbit &amp; The Lord of the Rings 50+ times (so far), but only recently finally waded through the fascinating but dry Silmarillion.  Wonderful narrative stories fleshing out the sketches in the Silmarillion, plus background on the War of the Ring.  My favorite parts had to be the material from the Third Age-  who wouldn't thrill at reading detailed dialogue of the rivalry between Gandalf &amp; Saruman, or how Bilbo actually got chosen for his adventure, &amp; Thorin's disdain about the whole thing. Best book I've read since Tolkien's trilogy itself!
0156027321|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and was disappointed to see such an abrupt ending... but not so much so that I cannot give the overall story 5 stars.<br />My favorite sections of the book were when Pi lived in India and described his life and his fascination with religion. I so much enjoyed the descriptions of the three religions that Pi practiced: Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam. I loved how Pi did not see the three as mutually exclusive.<br />The \\"meat\\" of the story comes when Pi is shipwrecked and lives for 227 days on a 26-foot life boat with an adult Bengal tiger, named Richard Parker. At first he deathly afraid of the carnivore, and begins to plot how he can kill the tiger. I was so happy to see Pi accept Richard Parker's existence, and realize that he needed him there in order to keep himself alive.<br />Like I mentioned above, the end wrapped up quickly, I could have seen the story go quite a but further. Yet, I loved the overall tale...It read very quickly and was much like a fable mixed in with elements of \\"Worst Case Scenario\\".
B00005JKN9|1.0|Allright, listen:  I rented this film because my father recommended it to me.  It was a frigging act of filial piety for chrissake.  I watched the flick for about five minutes.  During this interval, I spent the entire time talking bollocks at the screen.  Then I turned it off.<br />The movie is pure disedification.  For the first few minutes you get to see a teaming horde of Irish immigrants who are apparently living in a state of continuous gyration in catacombs beneath the city streets.  These rejects then go topside to do battle with a poorly constituted militia of various and sundry Italian rejects.  In the senseless violence that ensues, the viewer finds himself confronted with proof positive that most people's lives are utterly meaningless:  first there are the gutter trash in the movie desporting themselves in this lugubrious and senseless fashion, then there is the further reality that this glorification of street scum is colluded in by an enourmous number of people, from the audience to the makers and backers of the movie, to the critical establishment.  All so that your average wannabe gang-banging white suburbanite can go see a movie that convinces him of the hoary respectablity of being street filth.  Hooray.
B00005JKN9|2.0|How many Acadamy Award Nominations?  Wow, what a let down.  Leonardo DiCaprio really can't act very well and he proved that yet again in Gangs of New York.  The story is pretty good and I liked the acting of Danial Day-Lewis and even the cinamatography(sp?), but all that could'nt counter DiCaprio's poor preformance.  Just how many crying scenes does he have in this movie?  8?  10?  His character is a real wimp and so you just can't take him seriously as an avenging angel.  Buy Goodfella's or Caligula but steer clear of this waste of money.
B00000FCBC|5.0|Metallica definetly delivers on this 2-disc set.  In a time when everyone has lost faith in this awesome band, this album stands out as a gem.  The first disc contains newly recorded covers, which all sound downright amazing.  The second disc contains previously recorded covers throughout the band's history, and also kicks major ...  No matter which aspect of Metallica you like, you're guaranteed to find satisfaction in Garage Inc... It DEFINETLY delivers.
B00005JLSE|5.0|Like the windy city in which this movie is set, the musical numbers in Chicago simply blew me away.  I've read comparisons between Chicago and Moulin Rouge, but believe me - there is no comparison.  Where Moulin Rouge had a sappy plot buried somewhere among the flashy morass, Chicago's musical numbers tie the storyline together in a clever, coherent fashion.  The droll dialog (an announcer intones \\"Miss Velma Kelley, in a act - of desperation!\\") and tongue-in-cheek numbers (Richard Gere is a tapdancing laywer - both literally and figuratively) all add up to one very innovative movie.  I was sorry to see the movie come to an end - and there's not many movies I can say that about!
B00004XOWM|1.0|I'm not referring to the band with Shirley Manson in it when I say \\"GARBAGE\\".  I'm referring to where this CD should be placed and left permanently.  The highlight of Fred Durst's musical career was \\"seeing\\" Britney Spears for a whole day.  It's all downhill from here for him and this crappy band.  Good riddance!
B000002H2H|5.0|Although many people say that The Black Album or Master of Puppets are Metallica's best albums, don't get me wrong they're great albums and they're in the 5 star worthy material but Ride the Lightning is my favorite Metallica and quite possibly my favorite thrash metal album, I think that 5 stars is not enough for Ride the Lightning, I easily give this album an 11.<br />'Fight Fire With Fire' starts off with a soft intro and it turns into a thrash metalhead's heaven and it's a killer song and I love the explosion at the end of the song. 10/10<BR>'Ride the Lightning' is the title track and it's another Metallica classic although it isn't nearly as fast as the previous song but it's worthy enough to enter inside a thrash metalhead's mind. 8/10<BR>'For Whom the Bell Tolls' starts off with the tolling bell and although I didn't think much for this song at first but the chorus lines helped me like this song and the tolling bells is awesome. 10/10<BR>'Fade to Black' is a bit slower and softer than the previous songs they've done but Metallica can do a slower song very well (that is up until they're Load stuff) and the loud guitar's somewhat reminds me of Black Sabbath's Iron Man which is also a classic, and there are more songs to come that have the same vein as 'Fade to Black'. 10/10<BR>'Trapped Under Ice' is probably my least favorite song off of this album but it's still a good song especially compared to their post-Black Album era. 7/10<BR>'Escape' is probably the most underrated song off of this album and I actually like this song alot, and I wish that the same thing can be said with the other Metallica fans. 9/10<BR>'Creeping Death' is another standout for this album and it's one of their heaviest songs off of this album. 10/10<BR>'The Call of Ktulu' is the closing track and believe it or not, I actually didn't think much for this song but I gave it a few listens and now this is my favorite song off of this album and I could listen to this song like 5 times in a rowand never get tired of it, Ride the Lightning is worth it for the price of this song alone and this song is easily one of heavy metal's best instrumentals of all time. 10/10<br />If you never heard of anything that Metallica has done before the Black Album? Then you're going to be in for a total surprise and this is the way how Metallica first started, if you liked the later Metallica stuff then you should get into their early stuff when they were total thrash but the best of both worlds, Metallica is now the MTV Icons.
B00009W0WM|5.0|Of course the movie gets 5 stars, as it's one of the best ever.  It really is a timeless movie.(I think the song &quot;Time goes by&quot; helps w/ that)<br />The audio commentary by Roger Ebert is one of the best features on the DVD, and there are other features sure to make this purchase worthwhile for just about anyone.<br />One criticism tho... I almost had to take a star off for the 'Carrotblanca' &quot;tribute&quot; cartoon.  It is, in all honesty, an abomination. Warner Brothers should have their license to ruin bugs bunny &amp; company permanently revoked.  The voices were bad, the drawings lacked the original quality, and the gags in the cartoon were everything you'd expect to see in a Looney Toons cartoon, but aren't executed well &amp; come across as totally unfunny.  If they had any respect for these classic cartoons, they'd stop ruining their image w/ crud like this.  Anyways trust me, the Carrotblanca cartoon on this DVD is bad, especially when compared to the originals. <br />Buy the DVD for the movie &amp; the many features as well.   It's a movie that should be in everybody's collection.
B00008PX8P|5.0|5 1/2 hours of music and video for this price?  This is THE must have DVD for any fan of music.
B000099T2L|5.0|I watched Beyonce on the Early Show one morning a few weeks ago, and heard some of the songs and knew immediately I was going to like it, she said in her interview that she wanted this cd to be a Classic and she got it, this will be one you turn to time and time again to listen to, I know I do already!The song \\"yes\\" is a great song to play as your having a quiet dinner at home with candle light and your favorite person..so sexy!! The music has a great sound and what can I say I just love it!! Way to go girl!!
B00005BJ9W|5.0|This is the best album by Duran, in fact, I think it's the best album ever.
0060392886|5.0|The Dirt is the story of four misfits who united to form one of the greatest rock bands of the 1980s.  Unfortunatley, Motley Cure is frequently remembered for their bad-boy images and legal troubles and not for the great music that was a soundtrack for man of us growing up in the 80s.  In the book, Nikki, Tommy, Vince and Mick finally get a chance to tell their own story...the best they can remember it.  We read about the days before Motley Crue...Mick busting his butt playing in band after band, Tommy and Nikki playing the bars in search of the perfect band and Vince discovering that he could actually sing.  The four joined forces in the early 80s and changed the face of music.  In the process, the slept with thousands of random women, went through countless wives and girlfriens and injected all forms of drugs into their bodies.  After reading the book, it's a miracle that these guys are all still alive or not in prison, although the guys did spend their share of time in jail over the years.  Perhaps the best part of the book was that Mick Mars, who has long been in the shadows of the legend of Motely Crue, finally gets to set the record straight and tell his own story.  Mick, for the first time, talks about his own demons and about the difficulty of working with 3 egomaniacs like Tommy Lee, Nikki Sixx and Vince Neil.  Nikki and Vince often come off like sniveling little brats who are just screaming for attention, but isn't that what the music is all about.  Motley Crue is all about decadence and glamour.  Tommy's story is more of a guy who still, after all of these years, has yet to discover himself.  Throughout his marital problems and even while in jail, Tommy remained a child at heart, who's biggest fear was being ingored.  Read the book...It's a great testament to a great rock and roll band.  And no other book better captures the spirit of the \\"Decade of Decadence\\".  And after you're done reading...put on \\"Shout at the Devil\\".....
B00005JM1F|5.0|Old School finds a sweet middle ground between sappy drama and low-budget comedy. It is entertaining and light-hearted in its own right while managing not to sink to the hellish pit that movies such as Freddie Got Fingered inhabit. It might not be the most original of comedies, but then again, what comedy in recent memory has been? I alternated from chuckling at embarassing situations to balling on the floor laughing at some points in the two hours I spent watching this film. The basics of the plot can be summed up as follows; three buddies finding marriage and adult responsibilities to be overly burdensome, decide to spice up their life by starting an eclectic \\"fraternity\\" at a local college. Something about seeing older guys trying to start a fraternity is highly amusing to me. With the motif of fraternal bonding at its core, I feel that Old School appeals mainly to guys. This is the type of movie where after finishing the movie, you can lay back, scratch yourself and reaffirm your manhood. That being said, this is not to say that only men can watch this; anyone can appreciate this movie's downright hilarity. An easy 5 stars.
B00005JMD3|2.0|I went into this movie expecting a flimsy plot, cheesy macho lines, and alot of entertaining action-with the caveat that some of it would be unbelievable. The movie started out promising with Colin Farell (Jim Street) playing his usual role as a police officer with all the natural instincts and skills to become a top SWAT member but of course, he is  still very raw and is a bit of a renegade which rubs the top brass the wrong way.  A new SWAT team under the supervision of Sam Jackson (Hondo)is formed and Street is given his second shot to make it or break it.<BR>The movie then takes a turn for the worse when the SWAT Team must excort international terrorist Alex Montel from LA to federal custoday.  Montel goes on TV and promises $100M to anyone that will help free him. Of course our SWAT team is subsequently attacked by what seems like every single gun-toting LA citizen.<BR>Yes: People are going to attack the LAPD/LAPD SWAT Team just because they were promised $100M from a Terrorist. That would be the equivalent to Americans trying help get Osama Bin laden escape..Although the actions sequences were done well, the plot holes made this film unbelievable and not very exciting.
0385504209|2.0|Hearing the hype and the subject matter, I picked up a copy of Brown's book. Found positives and negatives.<br />Positives?  the book certainly kept you riveted, main characters had little time to catch their breath.  Attention to detail was another plus. Brown did tie all pieces together well.<br />Negatives? I found the characters very one dimensional. With so much action, there was little in the way of character development.<br />But the primary reason I would not recommend this book is its cross-pollinating of truth and fiction. As a religious scholar much of the dialog between Brown's ficitonal &quot;scholars&quot; left me wanting to join the debate.  Much of the information was just plain wrong, dare I call it lies?  And from many of the reviews I've read on this site, most have taken the bait - hook, line and sinker.  Being a cynic, I wonder if Mr. Brown didn't deliberately muddy the waters between fact and fiction. His opening note that the places, documents, etc are true only made the distinction between fact and fiction even blurrier.<br />While the attention to details builds this book's positives, its lack of truth in those details makes this one book I cannot recommend.

B00005JM09|5.0|First of all, id like to say that Jonathan Mostow did a great job on this movie. turned out like i thought it would. T3 was alot better than what T2 was. James Cameron just put a little too much drama in the terminator thing in the second one. The TX was much better and deadlier thean the T-1000 and had more than a attitude than what the cbu-model 101 terminator had in the first film. TX enjoys its work that it does for skynet. if terminator 3 was sooooo bad like many have said, than why did it hit #1 for awhile at the box office? T3 proves that the terminator series can live without james cameron as the director. james cameron had his chance to make a really good trilogy, but he blew it. if u havnt seen the film yet, u will find out why Linda Hamilton didnt come back. i liked how arnold had a attitude in his charactor. john conner made him too much of a ...in the second film, i swear i will not kill anyone, give me a break. in this film, we finally know what skynet is, and know how the war started. even through evidence was destroyed in the second film, somthing is always left behind for someone to find and continue the last persons work. from what i hear, a terminator 4 could be possible. aslong as the script is well writin and i do mean well writin, a 4th film could do great if arnold doesnt come back. and they mentioned he might consider coming back even if he's govenor. and if he doesnt, flash backs of him would be in the 4th film. after seeing terminator 3, i am hoping for a terminator 4. aslong as its well writin, im pretty sure it will make it with or without arnold. but if a 4th does come, like so many, i hope arnold will be in it for one last battle as the big guy. as for arnold being gov, in california, terminate them arnold!, arnold has my vote. if terminator 3 is arnolds last movie, its good to know that his acting career ended with a big bang for a movie.
0425152251|1.0|serioulsy, this book is AWFUL!  after reading all the glowing reviews, i was really excited about this book, but it's one of the worst things i've ever read.  the story is ridiculous, and the philosophy is extremely superficial.  besides ignoring nearly all of the 20th century philosophers...(where are you foucault?!) the author glosses over HUGE portions of the history of philosophy.  philosophy is important to study because it is exciting, groundbreaking, worldchanging... this book left me utterly bored.  any author that can make freud seem boring and dry is an author to avoid... AVOID THIS BOOK AT ALL COSTS
B000002LGA|5.0|this is a great 5 star cd due to one thing and one thing only, the passion and dreary clear landscape that Lou Reed was able to paint with his brush of reality programming that we all call NEW YORK.<br />the songs take no prisoners and although Lou Reed will mostly sing song talk in most of his songs, only the people who can't enjoy this will miss out on a truely great message heavy anthropological gem that NEW YORK really is.<br />Simply the Best.  (personally am amazed at the song HALLOWEEN PARADE, perhaps the best song written about AIDS)
B00009ATIX|1.0|This film is irredeemably bad.  The pacing is ponderous at best, there are numerous large holes in the story, and none of the characters are able to inspire any degree of pathos.  On the positive side, such as it is, the acting is good and the cinematography is beautiful - especially in the way it conveys subtle hints about the story.<br />What seems to be the main story, the odd phenomenon of people from the crew's memories appearing as visitors on the ship is actually just a frame for the real story, that of Dr. Kelvin's relationship with his wife (who is his visitor) and her eventual suicide.  This story is told through flashbacks and dreams that Kelvin has.  As some folks have pointed out, it can be a bit difficult to piece them together, but there are enough clues there to make it pretty obvious what happened.  What isn't obvious, or even hinted at, is why he would stay with such a basket case.  One is given plenty of time to ponder this question in the almost interminable flashback sequences.  With tighter pacing, this film could have been 15 minutes long.<br />Most of the holes are in the story that acts as a frame.  Who is Dr. Gordon's visitor, why was Snow's visitor himself, why did Gibarian commit suicide, and so on.<br />The pseudo-science is also annoying.  By no means do I insist on hard SF realism, but the few scientific details they do throw in are bad enough to make Star Trek look accurate.  The visitors are composed of \\"subatomic particles, held in suspension by a Hinks field\\".  The solution to getting rid of them is to generate an inverse field.  Somehow, doing so causes the nearby planet to start gaining mass.  Whatever.<br />Please save yourself from seeing this monumental waste of time.  For those wondering why this is only almost the worst movie ever, it's because it doesn't come close to the level of awfulness of Being Human.

B00009MGQL|1.0|Jeff Beck understands better than anyone on Earth what the electric guitar is all about. His mastery of tone, attack, and sonics is leagues beyond any other player. His playing has never been about speed, but rather about wringing every last ounce of guts out of the guitar. So if you have the privilege of being the producer of a Jeff Beck album, why in the world would want to bury the guitar under synthesizers, computer drums, and reverb? I'm sure the producer thought it would make everything sound contemporary, and given the cookie-cutter blandness and utter lack of talent of most performers these days, I can see why producers would choose this approach as a matter of habit. But it is exactly the wrong thing here. Beck needs to be front and center, in your face, with every nuance of his strings and fingers and screaming amp ripping things up. He needs to be playing with real musicians, not machines. Computers and synthesizers are the antithesis of Jeff Beck. He needs to be playing with people who are as cutting edge as he is, people sweating and bleeding and pushing their instruments to the edge alongside him. He also needs strong songs, not this two-chord pablum. For most the CD you can barely discern what he's playing under all the garbage, and at no point can you actually hear his attack on the strings. This whole record is a criminal misuse of talent and a cruel tease. Skip this one and get out Beckola instead.
0312263120|1.0|I had ordered \\"Angels & Demons\\" with this and Amazon only shipped Digital Fortress to me so far. Thank goodness, for after reading the first 50 pages of this \\"Thriller\\" I was persuaded to cancel Angels & Demons from my order before it shipped! Yeah, its that bad. I think I should have known better than to trust someone who's bio reads like an application for a grad school English major. He makes the mistake of trying to write about technology without having the slightest clue how to do so realistically. (Is there a big door in NSA that has the abbreviation \\"CRYPTO\\" on it like it was even a real word?) Had he researched cryptology and cryptography just a little bit he would have rewritten the book from scratch or simply quit, its that beyond the pale. If you don't know the first thing about computers and agree with the philosophy that Big Brother should be able to read your mail for you own good, you may actually enjoy the ultra-conservative ill-informed rhetoric of this novel. That is if you can believe that a character with a 170?! IQ can act like a giddy, stupid child and that a code can be written that's unbreakable just because it has a tricky algorithm that is kept a secret. I'd like to think Mr. Brown has grown a great deal as an author since this outing, but I'm not going to gamble my money on it ever again.
0316776963|4.0|The pieces gathered in this collection of humorist David Sedaris's writings are all interesting, insightful (into the human condition), and funny. But behind the humor, I suspect, is a deep well of pain. Sedaris is a gay author who writes about things other than being gay; and when he writes of his own homosexuality, it is always without any fanfare. In fact, the unifying theme of these stories seems to be the pain of being \\"odd\\" or an outsider. In some cases, Sedaris's outsider status can be clearly linked to his being gay (as in the opening story, \\"Go Carolina,\\" which describes the ordeal of being one of several sensitive boys in his school who is singled out for speech therapy for their lisps and effeminate speaking patterns). Elsewhere, his outsider status is due to being a northerner who moved to North Carolina, or an American who spends summers in France. On top of this, just being a member of his family seems to automatically qualify him for instant alien and mutant status. In fact, because of this many of his stories reminded me of souped up (some may say \\"vulgarized\\") versions of James Thurber's classic stories of his eccentric Ohio relatives. In fact, one story about his struggle to give up drinking, \\"The Late Show,\\" reminded me of \\"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.\\" As Sedaris struggles to make it through painful nights of insomnia he fashions a variety of outlandish identities for himself. While exagerated humor is a constant in Sedaris's stories, there is always something else present just below the surface that almost anyone can identify with. In flaunting his eccentricities and outsider status, Sedaris has presented himself as a universal type, a true everyman.
B00008N6N5|5.0|this is one of the best movies i have ever seen, and yet i never see it on anybody's great movies lists. it's by milos forman, one of the best directors ever, and i can assure you it's not any less good than one flew... or amadeus, also by him but much more aprriciated. it's also woody harrelson's best performance in my opinion. and remember that this movie is not about porn, it's about free speech. watch it.
B000005PW0|5.0|I admit that I got plenty of laughs out of sequels 2 through 4. Installments 5 & 6 were okay, but nothing special. As another reviewer has already pointed out, once Steve Guttenberg left there was little reason to keep watching.<br />The first Police Academy movie is truly the cream of the crop, though, as is usually the case with any series of movies.<br />The premise is simple enough - the new female mayor has dropped the height/weight/physical regulations of the police force, and opened up the police academy to anyone who fancies themselves as a cop. Naturally, this leads to a crazy assortment of oddballs rocking up for training.<br />Among this crew is Hightower, a seven foot plus man built like a brick wall; Tackleberry, a gung-ho trigger happy gun buff who seems a sandwich or two short of a picnic; Hooks, a little woman with an even littler voice (until the right moment); Jones, whose vocal chords can replicate just about any sound from video games to machine guns; and last but definitely not least, Mahoney, who is at the Academy only as part of a deal to keep him out of jail for his latest idiot exploits.<br />The latter cannot quit the Academy under the rules of the deal, but can be thrown out without landing in jail as a result. Consequently, he pulls every stunt under the sun to try and get himself kicked out, to no avail.<br />It is no surprise that, somewhere along the line, misfit Mahoney discovers that he might actually like to be a cop, and decides to stick at it rather than put all his efforts into getting thrown out.<br />The climax of the movie, a riot in which the cadets accidentally find themselves smack in the middle of, proves that even the worst hopeless cases can do good for themselves.<br />The final scene, in which all the cadets graduate, is about as uplifting as a screwball comedy can get.<br />Steve Guttenberg and G W Bailey really make this movie with their constant interaction and clashes. Bailey was at his best in this film as the sergeant who was determined to 'encourage' all the 'loser cadets' to quit as soon as possible.<br />This is an excellent movie. It rolls along at a great pace, building up to an exciting climax with a more than satisfying ending. The movies that came after were really just eye candy after this one - pleasant to watch, but not very substantial. If you don't have this film, and you're a fan of this type of comedy, do yourself a big favour and buy a copy. You won't regret it.determined to 'encourage' all the 'loser cadets' to quit as soon as possible. <BR>This is an excellent movie.

B00001PE4D|5.0|Many people compare this to the original book and the 1988 movie based on the book, and find this movie short. Since I haven't read the book or watched the 1988 movie, I really enjoyed this movie. The cast is good and gives a great performance (I found Sarah Michelle Gellar's performance to be a little annoying and not very credible, but since most other reviewers seemed to like it, I assume it's because I'm just got used to her Buffy persona too well). The soundtrack is great, and the DVD has plenty of extras (such as a director's commentary, video clips, deleted scenes, behind the scenes documentary) - all of the standard ones, nothing special or extraordinary, but still very enjoyable.
B000002C1V|2.0|=    a sad note on which to end an extraordinary career<BR>Reviewer: EKS from Hamilton, NY<BR>&quot;The Final Cut&quot; was, for me, a great disappointment. <BR>I agree with those who label it the first of Waters' solo albums. The greatest tragedy of this album is that Waters leaves too little space for Gilmour's gorgeous and transcendant guitar solos. The general tone of the album is harsh and even unpleasant--no doubt the effect that Jolly Roger was hoping to acheive, but nonetheless no fun to listen to.<br />But my complaint is not merely that this album is not &quot;easy listening.&quot; &quot;The Final Cut&quot; lacks the musicality that Waters needed to carry his lyrics. None of the songs have a recognizable melody. Certain tracks, like &quot;The Gunner's Dream,&quot; have recurring motifs, but nothing that could be called a tune. Of course, there are many Floyd songs that lack a melody, even masterpieces like Dogs, Welcome to the Machine, Time, Money, and Us and Them. But these tracks made up for it with lyrical guitar solos and richly textured keyboard backgrounds by Wright. Both of these key Floydian elements are lacking on The Final Cut; the result is an album that may touch the social conscience through its lyrics but whose music does nothing to touch the soul.<BR>Moreover, this album proves that Waters' lyrics cannot carry themselves. Often during &quot;The Final Cut,&quot; Waters gets carried away with metaphor.  Much of his imagery is heavyhanded, lacking the simple mystical elegance of his lyrics for &quot;Animals,&quot; &quot;Dark Side of the Moon,&quot; &quot;Wish You Were Here,&quot; or &quot;Meddle&quot; - the group's finest albums. Furthermore, Waters' singing voice on this album is grating, and so exposed that often he is blatantly off key.<BR>In their most productive and successful years, Waters carried the group, both lyrically and conceptually. In the end however, his last Floyd effort is a failure. I've heard this album praised for its &quot;rawness of feeling.&quot; Raw it is. Floyd it is not.
1587990717|2.0|While reading this book I kept wondering why it was published.  It seemed like a vanity publishing job.  Taleb does not present any new ideas, nor does he add to their understanding by novel examples.  It reads mostly like a musings taken from someone's journal - barely fleshed out ideas.  When Taleb sticks to examples of randomness in markets, the book is okay and the examples elucidate the ideas relatively well.  I would have given it three stars for this positive aspect alone.  But, he feels compelled to apply his framework to other parts of life.  It is a stretch and his arguments are very, very thin.  It's more like he is trying to justify his dislike of certain people with thinking that sounds rational, mathematical or scientific.  He abuses all those terms regularly.<br />What stands out most about this book is the author's barest (I could hardly find it) recognition of the irony of his position.  He dwells on survivorship bias in statisitical inference - that the the successful traders (or fund managers) in a sample do not reflect the true performance, or risk, for we are not accounting for all those who failed (and thus are not in the sample for moving on to other jobs).  Random simulation can produce a group of winners (or survivors) over a number of years.  That is, pure chance can be produce results that mirror actual observations of performance of a group of traders over time.  Taleb calls succesful traders (those who survive in the business) \\"lucky fools\\" when they disagree with his his trading style or philosophy.  Yet he fails to recognize, by his own arguments and examples, that he is part of this set of survivors and is just as much a lucky fool.  That is, he gets to write this book because he is a successful trader (he hasn't \\"blown up\\" and been forced out of the business, yet..), but his own success can be assigned to chance.  Lucky fool.  In short, nothing in this book can help you as a trader.  All you will learn is that if you are a lucky fool, then you should be humble and recognize that you are unlikely to know why are you are succesful and when you will \\"blow up.\\"  It's the only consistent argument in the book.
B00008CLIP|5.0|I have both MTV Unplugged compilations and I am always listenings to this version. This Version has Elton John, Sheryl Crow, Midnight Oil and a host of other great groups and songs. It is well worth it to get this album. The Sheryl Crow song is espially good, she does a piano solo through most of the song that is very good that seems to go back to her early childhood days. But don't get me wrong it's tough to find a bad song on this album.
0439288886|1.0|My daughter was assigned to read this book over the summer in between 4th and 5th grade. Although I know it is a great classic, it is extremely difficult to read, especially for her age. I am reading it to her and I, myself find that it is difficult to read and there are many words which I need to look up and many phrases which I cannot even lookup, so we are missing a great deal. I wish there was a modern American English translation available so that we could enjoy the story and not get so stuck on just trying to understand what is going on.

B0000AXE8I|4.0|I personally think that this is the sequel that stumps all sequels, packing a whallop and never letting you go.  But this is one movie that fits each person differently.  If you await the same \\"Bullet Time\\"-style action in the first one, you will be far from disappointed.  If you lust for the intensely mind-warping science-fiction, there's even more in store for you.  But there are people who think it's too chitty-chatty, too strenuous on their fragile, little attention spans, or too much of an effort for the Whachowskis to make a few extra bucks.  Everyone will see at least one miniscule flaw, but other than that, \\"The Matrix Reloaded\\" is the biggest innovation in sci-fi action sequels since \\"T2\\".<br />It starts off with Neo dreaming of Trinity's death.  This especially worries him now that the two of them are extra close.  Things only get worse when it's realized that the machines threatening Zion are moving in closer and will threaten the city's survival if something isn't done in twelve hours (specifically if something isn't done by Neo, him being The One and all).  You've probably heard that Agent Smith now has the ability to copy himself from anyone else in the Matrix.  I won't tell you how (I hate spoilers as much as the next guy).  I will say that it's an especially cool way to bring him back for the sequel, gining him much more power and presenting a seemingly unsurpassable conflict.  There's an superbly done car chase thrown in near the end, plus a good look into the city of Zion and a lot of incredible secrets unveiled about the Matrix.  I give it a missing star because there were just a few points in the plot I couldn't understand, but that is absolutely it.<br />I'm going to literally blast into the store the day \\"Reloaded\\" is released on DVD, and the ending literally makes me itch to see \\"Revolutions\\" in November.  So pre-order \\"Reloaded\\" and it should tide you over until then.  If you were told good things about this sequel, you were not misled.  If you were told bad things, you were.
B000000IVW|5.0|Whether or not it's Guns N' Roses' best album is debatable - it's not really the point (I actually prefer Use Your Illusion I. Paradise City can never match the genius of November Rain, sorry). The point is that this is one of the most amazing debut albums ever done by anyone, and from the very first track any listener can tell right away that Guns were the most important new rock group since Van Halen debuted nine years earlier. Not to say that U2 and R.E.M haven't arrived during that gap, and maybe in the long run they mattered more, but in '87 they were still struggling and Guns made this one album count more than everything U2 and R.E.M have in five years, combined. Like other great rock bands, in the finest tradition of Van Halen and Led Zeppelin, Guns N' Roses entered the scene in an explosion of talent and energy, and burned out just as abruptly.<br />Guns looked and sounded a lot like many hair-rock and metal bands of their time, but they were much more. Axl Rose was more than another mike-wielding, long-haired screamer - he was one of the most brilliant stage performers ever to sing a rock n' roll song. Likewise, Slash was never another virtuoso technical guitarist like Malmsteen or Van Halen - although he did possess a technical skill to match theirs any day - Slash is a classic blues and rock guitarist who draws from Jimmy Page, Jimi Hendrix and Jeff Beck. And he makes each of his solos count, being entirely unique and memorable, sometimes more than the songs themselves. Together they were a classic rock duo in the tradition of Page and Plant or Jagger and Richards, and every bit as charismatic and wonderful to the ears as those old rock gods.<br />Perhaps Guns saved much of their material for Use Your Illusion - Appetite is much more focused and concentrated, and while it's not as varied and rich as UYI, it doesn't have as much filler material, either. Every song on Appetite For Destruction is a gem, and every one has tremendous radio potential, from themassive hits Welcome To The Jungle, Sweet Child O' Mine and Paradise City to the lesser known tunes like Out Ta Get Me or Anything Goes. They're all fantastically produced, masterfully arranged rock pieces, and they're all wonderful head bangers with amazing guitars and great bass and drums. Paradise City is an incredible pop-rock classic, as is Sweet Child O' Mine - which has one of the most memorable guitar riffs of all time. Welcome To The Jungle, on the other hand, is an anthem of super-hard rock. It's So Easy, Rocket Queen, Mr. Brownstone and Nightrain are all worthy of mention too. You're Crazy is also terrific - although I prefer the acoustic version from `Lies', which is truly spectacular.<br />In any case - Get Appetite For Destruction, it's a terrific album. It's best to start your GnR collection with Appetite and Use Your Illusion I, then move over to part 2, Lies and Live Era.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Do not pay attention to any hating reviews towards this CD. It is a very good, quality album. It may seem a little short, but as said before, quality over quanity is what I will take any day. It is a good follow-up album for a group that you can honestly tell has matured and improved. I am drooling at the idea of what LP can come out with in the future...
B000002UJQ|5.0|Not many 15 year old's like Radiohead, It's easy to see why, as they are not you average rock 'n' roll band, and they probably never will be. Although Pable Honey had it's moments, but if Pablo Honey and OK Computer were humans, Pablo would be a curious simpleton who can't decide what his music should sound like, and OK Computer wouldn't be from this planet. Because it is different to everything else from when it was released to even know in 2003, with only Muse and The Mars Volta coming close. So what is it that made Q Magazine recognise it as the greatest album ever? Is it the track album opener Airbag? With it's beautiful intro linked with the drums which give way to Thom's voice which gets more evolved with each album, and sounds amazing each time you hear it, then the song links cleverly with one of Radiohead's greatest songs, Paranoid Android, with the slightly un-rock'n'roll lyrics of 'Unborn chickens in my head'. The only thing that isn't more 'outthere' then their music is their videos, and Android is there perfect example of that, if you haven't seen it, find it, download it, whatever just see it, nothing can describe the feeling, you suddenly feel like you realise what it's like to be drunk and high, and it's a quirky feeling. But is is this what makes the album that great? Or is it probably their most beautiful song 'No Surprises', 'Fake Plastic Trees' being the other contender. The song about 'a quiet life' is so gentle with the tapping bass, and 1 - 2, 1 - 2 on the guitar, most of OK Computer is a challange to listen to, which in a way is the beauty of Radiohead, But No Surprises is a song you can unwind to and just drift away for a few minutes of pure pleasure. Fitter Happier is...there is no words to understand and figure this 'poem' if you will, read like it was being said by Steven Hawkings, It's the most 'passible' track on the album but if you read the lyrics with the rest of the album you just have to work it out yourself what it all means. Or ask someone. The thing with OK Computer is simply the texture put it into this record, layer by layer you unfold and it's either more warped or more stunning, either way, you engrossed and you don't want to leave, just like 'The Bends' only 'The Bends' dosn't have as many layers but it's just as good, some people say better, I am one of those people, but this is still an amazing record, and at the end of it you just have to ask yourself. 'Was this really the band that did Creep?'
B000069CWE|3.0|This is an ok album. It seems like some kind of a filler to keep the time inbetween 2 very good albums. My favorite tracks are the X-ecutioner one and Hi Voltage. Whoever said the skits are cool is wrong, they are just stupid answering machine messages. Dont get me wrong, there are a lot of good things about Reanimation.<br />Id say its an average CD.
0792164903|5.0|I did not expect this to be a good movie.  I rented it on payper view only because I was bored. I was really surprised.  It is now one of my faverite movies.  The connection between Depp and Ricci are portrayed so realisticly.  It is almost like this story actually happened.
0316666343|4.0|I liked the narrative but thought the last 1/3 of the book was a tad unrealistic.  But overall a good read.
B000002H33|5.0|This is Metallica in their prime. This is the Metallica that we die-hard fans love. Not the new souless, yucky Metallica. This album is perfect from start to finish. Amazing instrumentation and amazing songs. This is the album that solidified Metallica's place in rock history. You can't go wrong with songs like &quot;Sanitarium&quot; and &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;. If you're just starting to get into Hard Rock metal music this is the best place to start. I guarantee that you won't be disappointed. A must have for all rock fans.
0156027321|5.0|It seems that the Life of Pi is a culmination and the story of the Life of People. Our journey through life is filled with wonderful and dangerous events, death, fear and pain, yet it is difficult to convince ourselves, even with religion, that what we have is truly what we need to survive - however little and odd that may be. <BR>As a reader, I felt sad and joyful when I closed the back cover, but I was left with a touch of wonder streaming through my mind. Are our lives just as strange? Do we like Pi and like the mathematical symbol go on surviving randomly from day to day, holding our ever present fears, our Bengal Tigers, under some semblance of control? When will we reach the shores of survival so our fears will vanish in the woods, never to be seen again? I purchased this book through Amazon.com right after another great purchase, The Losers' Club by Richard Perez, about an unlucky writer addicted to the personals. Both are intense, recommended books. Enjoy!
B000089RVX|2.0|Evanescene's FALLEN , its amazing , I mean, I was going to give them 5 stars, but after listen to a band CALLED NIGHTWISH , my rate went down by far... if you love EVANESCENE , and you think their music blown you away , just give it a try to NIGHWISH'S albums OCEANBORN and WISHMASTER... and then you'll probably going to be like me... Evanescenes [is]horribe live....
0316666343|5.0|The Lovely Bones deals with the difficult issue of rape -- only survival is not in the picture this time. The book's protagonist and narrator is 14 year old Susie Salmon. Susie is brutally raped and murdered by a creepy next door neighbor, George Harvey. <br />Susie tells her story from up in Heaven. She recounts in gross detail her rape and murder and voyage into heaven. Some of the most fascinating parts of the book are when Susie describes what her personal heaven looks, feels, sounds and smells like. It is both touching and amusing. <br />The book deals quite effectively with what it is like to lose a loved one. Susie is able to watch her family and (everyone else she knew down on earth including her murderer) and how they cope (or are unable to cope) with her sudden death. <br />Sebold examines what it is like for Susie's friends and family after they have lost a daughter or a sister or a granddaughter or a girlfriend. It is all so real it is almost frightening. <br />The novel takes a number of interesting twists and turns. One of which is completely unexpected. I remember thinking to myself as I started this novel \\"How long will I be able to read about people coping with death?\\" But this novel is about so much more than that. <br />The Lovely Bones is about spirituality. It is about bravery, individuality and finding oneself. Each of the main characters are on a quest to find themselves. <br />All in all the book is fascinating and superbly written. I promise you will not be disappointed. I purchased this book through Amazon.com right after another great purchase, The Losers' Club by Richard Perez, about an unlucky writer addicted to the personals. Both are intense, recommended books. Enjoy!
B000003CKH|5.0|Cake's style is different and extremely unique, somewhere between soft jazz, indie rock, and country twang. They have a great trumpet that just sort of mingles in between the notes with occasional solos adding a great touch. Cake isn't for everyone, but if you find you enjoy their music then this album is outstanding!
B0000B1OGD|4.0|This is the best Cowboys and Dinosaurs film out there.The story was one Wllis O'Brien tried to get produced in the 30's without<BR>                      succes.Three and half decades later his protegee Harryhausen finally gets it made.In addition to the lovely Gila Golan it stared<BR>                      James Fransicus (TV's Mr. Novak) but upon it's initial release it was paired with an incompatable co-feature and released during<BR>                      the hieght of the 60's student protests.It's audience either failed to find it or was more interested in protesting than going to the<BR>                      movies.It was quickly pulled from theaters and considered a failure.Luckily it went quickly to television.The segment where the<BR>                      Cowboys rope Gwangi is particularly memorable.
B000002GYI|5.0|Surprisingly, it might actually be the best electronic album by German perfectionists whose leaders used to play junk like 1960s flute and free Jazz-ish stuff... Computer World is as meticulously brilliant and endlessly facsinating as a concept album can get, yet it's as simple and satisfying as a child's nursrey rhyme (no easy task... and I would imagine that the supreme efforts involved here have figured prominately into their very modest output in the years following) ... anyway... it's sound waves look different (I've looked!), sound different, are different... and a nice change if nothing else... in any case, it's a favorite of mine... and from my point of view, I think you should consider enjoying it today... peace
6305882592|5.0|This film still holds up after 30 years. Only Monty Python's Holy grail and Blazing Saddles made me laugh more than this black humor masterpiece.
B00005JLWN|5.0|Ok people listen up, I know this movie didn't debut across the country, I know it didn't have big name backers flooding daytime TV shows with celebrity interviews and non-stop TV spots. I also know this movie was not a large budget undertaking. But it should have had all three. This movie is definately in the top five movies of all time as far as I am concerned. While lacking the budget for special effects and expensive location shots, this flick manages to score actors of the highest caliber making for an incredible performance even by Hollywood standards, there is not a single second of unbelievable acting that throws your trust in the story. The shooting locations, (Berlin, Rome) lend an impressive aura of authority to the movie's setting that only compliments the amazing character interaction. Christian Bale's performance as a Grammaton Cleric named Preston is without flaw. You can feel his rage at the machine that crushes all opposition to the Law. You can see his inner turmoil, and you can sense his fear when he mounts the Resistance. Not to mention the absolutely mind-blowing<BR>action scenes the man can produce (you have never seen anything like it, and no, this film does not use hong kong wire acting.)<BR>Angus MacFadyen portrays a head operative in the all controlling Big Brother society of the future with authority and magnificent presence; and Taye Diggs plays the role of devoted statesman and dangerous enemy to the hilt. (Literally!). The film has a well thought out premise and doesn't engage in gratuitous violence for the sake of shock value, making the action sequences in which Preston (Christian Bale) annhilates the bad guys (think black storm troopers in Matrix leather coats)are enough to cause you to jump on your coffee table and throw your drink through the wall and scream &quot;HELL YEA&quot; loud enough to scare your neighbors...or maybe that's just me. (If you have a high powered surround sound system, invite your friends over for this one). The director (Kurt Wimmer) did an absolutely amazing job splicing this one together, and the musical overtones and backgrounds will have you biting your tongue off in anticipation, and crying at the cruelty of man to his peers.<BR>I could talk about this movie forever, but I will simply say, when the sequel is made I will buy a copy sight unseen...although I hope they get rid of the white cadillac of the future. Oh yeah, and you guys who say Matrix is better...The Matrix WAS my favorite movie. Equilibrium crushes Matrix, and Matrix Reloaded underfoot with a giant steel-toed spiked leather standard issue grammaton cleric boot. Sorry Neo :(
B00006HAZG|5.0|I found this version of David Copperfield after discovering Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter movies), and decided to just buy it-- I'm very glad I did! It is a made-for-TV movie, but most of the time, I didn't even remember it was! The cast is great- so convincing, I've since started the book, and can really get in to it. <BR>The movie is an even spread of the conflict that Dickens intended, and has a nice sprinkling of humor. It's one of those movies you watch when curled up in a blanket. <BR>The only thing I don't like is the grown up David...
B00000DFRS|5.0|This is the CD that got me back into Whitney.  She takes quite a chance with the material and doesn't miss a beat.
B00004R99F|5.0|I don't think anyone should feel embarrassed admitting that they like this movie- it's great! Yes, I did first see it when I was in...middle school, I think, but it is SUCH a classic! Very funny- very cool, and- it's goofy! It even has cool music! (powerline...! :) )<BR>I've since graduated, and now I work in a kids-care center and see this movie ATLEAST three times a week, and I still love it! In fact, if it's my decision what movie gets put in, 9 times out of 10 this is what I'll choose! <br />(answer: LESTER!)
B0000026DJ|4.0|Very good album, solid, a pleasure to listen.
B00005JLSE|4.0|Is murder deplorable?  Most of the time, yes.<br />Fortunately, this is NOT what Chicago is about!  This is not a historical look at the 1920's jaded by this century's \\"immorality\\".  This movie is based on a 1975 Broadway Musical about media influence and the circus that the American public allows itself to be caught up in.  Funny that this is still so very very true 28 years later.<br />I loved the Broadway version of this story featuring Bebe Neworth and Ann Ranking, and I did like the movie version as well.  Are they the same?  Of course not silly.  Are they both enjoyable?  Absolutely!  <br />If you have no sense of irony and cannot see past the surface of movies, then you will probably not enjoy this film.  You must also practice the all-important willfull suspension of disbelief that makes movie magic successful.  There are shifts between reality and fantasy worlds in this film.  They are not handed to you on a silver platter, you must actual THINK for yourself during this film.  Imagine that.  You must also think for yourself and decide what this film is truly trying to say.  <br />Katherine Zeta Jones's training in Stage Musicals is evident in this film, as is Richard Gere's.  Rene Zellweger makes a remarkable first effort.  One thing that makes movie musicals so difficult to pull off is the different demand for voice talent between the two (stage and screen musicals).  If you had performers who were only familiar with stage acting do this film, it would be ridiculous.  They would seem to overact and over sing.  the audience is far away from the stage, but right in front of the story on film.  The effect is very different for each genre.<br />My only qualm about this movie is the removal of the Fosse choreography.  It adds such an interesting touch to the story (even if it was accidental and a mockery of the late choreographer's disabiltiy).  Inclusion of more of the original dance numbers would have made this a perfect 5 for me.<br />I believe this film, and all involved deserved Oscars.  If you think Gangs of New York should have won, check your history books!  The historical inaccuracies are mortifying!
B0000026DJ|4.0|Very good album, solid, a pleasure to listen.
B00005JMD3|3.0|If you're the kind of person who hates movies where the plot is relatively obvious, the quips are somewhat jaded and the acting takes second place to special effects and action sequences, I have some advice for you - DON'T GO SEE THIS MOVIE.<br />This movie is aimed at the mass-market, easy entertainment crowd where the eye candy is more important than the plot.  I liked it for what it was - 2 hours or so of no-brainer fun.
0385504209|1.0|I expected this book to be enjoyable light reading, and light reading it was.  The iconography was sort of interesting, but could not overcome the implausible plot twists and the completely stupid revelation at the end.  Oh yeah, and the protagonists hook up.  Who woulda thunk it.
B00005JLXE|3.0|I admit - I heard lots of bad things about this movie.  Bearing in mind that most of the derogatory comments came from hardcore Daredevil fans, I took the advice with a grain of salt.  There's definitely an all-star cast in this movie, the plot is nicely set up for a sequel, but there's something just a bit too superficial about the whole atmosphere.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie for what it was - an adaptation of a comic...
B00005JLWN|5.0|I was first not interested in viewing this movie when it hit the theaters; but after a co-worker raved about seeing it on pay-per-view over the weekend. I was intrigued and rented it the flowing weekend. Since then - I have been kicking myself for not seeing it in the theater.  It is truly an awe-inspiring film.  The fighting senses are precise and well choreographed.  It was nice to see their fighting style based off dance - which if you think about it - it is.  I have had a love-affair interest with Christian Bale since he exploded onto the movie sense in \\"Empire of the Sun\\".  He is an amazing actor - his facial expression capture you and pull you into the film until you can literally feel what he must be going through.  This is a must see
B00006CXSS|5.0|I viewed Band of Brothers over several nights on DVD. This is an excellent series. It was something close to me because my father was a paratrooper during that time for the allies. My grandfather was also at the beaches of Normandy on June 6th 1944 as part of the invasion force fighting against the Germans. I think this film is a good film for teenagers to see what their grandfathers and great-grandfathers did in WWII. Teens sometimes get jaded and don't know or realize their history. <BR>Getting back to Band of Brothers, story is excellent, photography is excellent and the acting is good and believable. All the actors are unknowns except David Schimmer (The guy from that show &quot;Friends&quot;). I thought he was the weakest point in the series. Other than him, the rest of the cast put in excellent performances especially the actor playing Captain Nixon. Very good film/series. Definitely a 5 Star rating.
B00006879E|5.0|Maroon 5 blends many types of music into one addictive sound. I haven't taken it outta my CD player yet! The best thing about this CD is that you can listen to the whole thing without having to skip a song. There are no &quot;filler&quot; songs in the whole CD. My favorite songs are &quot;Harder to Breathe&quot;, &quot;She Will be Loved&quot;, and &quot;All I Need&quot;, but all of the other songs are terrific. Pick up this CD to see what I mean. You will not want to stop listening to it! Buy it. You will be happy you did.
B000001ELP|5.0|that what sells does not nessescarily mean what is good.In this case...what doesen't sell.I have never reviewed an album on here ,but for this one i will.Being a big fan of the conceptual work Bob ezrin has done with Alice Cooper Lou Reed and Pink Floyd,coupled with the fact that i am a KISS fan..it could'nt be anything less than 5 stars.Despite being slagged by everyone from the fans to KISS and Ezrin themselves,this truly is one of the best albums anywhere.Certainly one of KISS' best.It was nice seeing them do something different and a shame they could never shake its negative aura to do something else this deep.Bottom line is it really does rock and in a perfect world would have propelled KISS to a new level.
B00006879E|5.0|I haven't taken this CD out of my car yet! Every song blends so many different types of music into one catchy and addicting sound. My favorite songs are &quot;Harder to Breathe&quot; and &quot;She Will be Loved&quot;. Pick this CD up, and you won't take it outta your CD player. Trust me! You'll be glad you did.
B00006CXXU|5.0|You could not have PAID me to buy the bubble-gum [stuff] that Christina put out a few years ago (Genie In a Bottle...BARF!), and I was VERY skeptical of this album.  The first singles off 'Stripped' ('Dirrty' and 'Beautiful') were OK and I liked them, but I wasn't going to buy the CD because of 2 songs. I have a vast collection of CDs that only have a couple of good songs on them.  I have been duped out of my [$$] (and more) many a time.<br />I am not a Christina Aguilera fan under normal circumstances. However, when I heard 'Fighter' and saw the video (in which she actually had some clothes on and she looked fabulous!), I was hooked. It is an excellent workout CD because I can let it play straight through. There are no [bad] songs on this album...TRUST ME!  My faves on the CD are 'Fighter', 'Make Over', 'Get Mine, Get Yours', and 'Walk Away'.<br />My recommendation is....BUY IT!
B00005A46T|5.0|hey just wanted to say that this is an awesome cd. awesome freakin cd. but i jsut cant believe i found it on toys r us.... lol w/e but anyway, slipknot did a great job on this album. theyre r many things to look forward to listenin to on this album such as the heretic anthem, my plague, ppl=s***, and my personal fav left behind. i think they did a great job and i cant wait for another one to come out
0385504209|4.0|This was hard to put down once I started.  I do hope someone decides to write a screen play for it... It would make a terrific movie!  There... short and sweet! ;-)
020530902X|5.0|Why does a thin book continue to generate interest and readership after so many years?  Because the &quot;Elements of Style,&quot; is one of the most condensed and comprehensive companions a writer, employee, student, can have.  This lightweight refresher can be used again and again when needed.
0312263120|5.0|I was introduced to Dan Brown's books only a few weeks ago, but have quickly absorbed all of his published works. It is easy to see why some are comparing his Da Vinci Code to the novel Conquest of Paradise. Both books deal masterfully with the more mysterious features of religion, politics, and science.  And both bring to light amazing bits of information, which are weaved into the intricate patterns of an overall compelling story.  While Brown compresses labyrinthine plots into brief time periods to provide page-turning suspense, Conquest of Paradise is of epic proportion, covering the entire world.  Of the Dan Brown books I've read so far, Digital Fortress is the second best I've read so far behind The Da Vinci Code.  Dan Brown truly has a talent for creating interesting, suspenseful prose.
B000089RW0|5.0|It seems a lot of people do not know that &quot;Ghost Ship&quot; is a remake. The remake added sense to the original (possibly done in the 70's, maybe early 80's) The original movie used the same eerie cover in less color. This remake gives more sense to the purpose of the ship. In the original, all you know is the ship runs on blood. That's it. No ghosts, no real story into the ship.... it just kills and runs on blood as fuel. Beck's remake gives us a better understanding behind the ship and what happened to her original crew as well as a better reason of the killing spree the ship is on. This was far better than the original.
B000057NVH|4.0|This is a very impressive SACD, my only regret is that it didn't use the GAIN 2 mastering system for DSD by Mobile Fidelity Sound LAB.  Overall it's a great choice for SACD &amp; sounds good.
B00005YUPO|5.0|I bought this when I was still pregnant, not knowing if it was a good idea.  Well, it was!!!  My little boy didn't really get into it until he was about 12 weeks old.  If I need to clean or REST, this lets me do it!!!  And, there was one reveiw that said that Mrs. Clark just wanted her little girl to be in anouther movie, well that is my sons favorite part!!!  He gets to see other kids playing!!!  Oh, and if you buy the DVD it has REPEAT PLAY!!!!
B00006L83N|5.0|Let's get real here.  There is no other band in the history of progressive rock to come even close to these cats.  They are the state of the art in artistic &amp; technical evolution as capable by human beings.  The comparisons to Dream Theater are ridiculous.  DT is not in the samer league &amp; not likely to be in this lifetime.<br />I've kown about Michael Romeo since his days with NJ underground legends Phantom's Opera.  Though the album he recorded with that band was classic melodic pop metal, there were hints of prog - including the master piece &quot;Portrait of Dorian Grey&quot;.  Even then, Mike's guitar solos were flawless, sound sculptures of sonic fury....  The man is true living legend of electric guitar.  Pay homage and buy his albums.

B00000K29E|3.0|No mucho se ha escrito acerca del inicio discográfico de Big Brother, y necesariamente el culpable es Cheap Thrills, uno de los trabajos más sobrevalorados de los 60's, pero esa es otra historia. Lo cierto es que hay consenso en que el sonido es bastante apagado, todo parece estar muy controlado y no hay grandes desbordes ya sea en las guitarras y en especial en la voz de Janis, que suena muy contenida en relación a sus futuros discos y para que decir en vivo.<br />Ahora bien, si lo que quieres escuchar es a la típica Janis desgarrándose la garaganta y a unos Big Brother con guitarras ácidas e improvisando largos minutos, este disco decepcionará. Aquí sólo hay temas cortos (de hecho el álbum dura apenas 25 minutos) pero hay algunas sorpresas como las sicodélicas Light is Faster Than Sound y All is Loneliness, los blues Bye Bye Baby y Women is Losers y la divertida Caterpillar. Y atento con los 2 bonus y los interesantes duelos guitarra/voz. <br />Puede ser que Big Brother no sea una banda muy espectacular y que Janis aún esté lejos de moestrar todo su potencial, pero si se quiere pasar un grato momento este incipiente ejercicio de acid rock es una buena elección
B00005B4GU|4.0|I like this cd, not to say it's anywhere near their greatest, but I think it's cool. All Radiohead cds to me (except HTTT) have a certain feel, and this one feels like a dark, confusing nightmare-which makes it interesting to listen to. There are some songs I skip: Pulk/Pull, Amnesiac/Morning Bell and Hunting Bears, mostly, but I like the rest a lot. I think that Life In A Glass House is one of their best songs period. I say give it a listen.
B00006GO9Q|5.0|I listen to this Miles Davis record more than most traditional jazz and rock. It is without categorization. You can tell he was listening to a lot of soul, funk, and 60's acid rock type music when this album came out. I would say this album is one of the more unique albums I've ever heard, especially considering it is from the late 60's. You can hear the roots of ambient music (which never has reached these heights) as well as an interesting hybrid of funk, classical, and jazz. The minimalist drums, bass, and guitar of Tony Williams, Dave Holland, and John McLaughlin give this album a restrained, but complex tension that isn't found on any of theirs or Miles's other albums. The end climax of the album is brilliant as Tony Williams peaks with Miles and shows off some of his chops. One of the few psychedelic jazz albums that beats out most of the work of famous rock people from that era. Too bad Miles and Hendrix never got together!
B00001OH7N|5.0|Es extraño que este disco esté situado entre los muy diferentes Space Oditty y Hunky Dory, pero justamente esa es una de las características particulares de Bowie, la de hacer un tremendo trabajo en un estilo (hard rock aquí) y luego cambiarlo por otro y así sucesivamente a lo largo de los 70's. Después del magnífico Ziggy Stardust este es a mi juicio su segundo mejor disco, un poco por encima de Hunky Dory.<br />Los primeros segundos de Width of a Circle dejan en claro que lo que se viene es un rock potente, con un Tony Visconti al bajo usando fuzz y en ningún momento dejándose absorver por la genial guitarra de Mick Ronson, verdadera estrella del álbum y que no para de entregar monumentales riffs en casi todos los temas. Pero a diferencia de sus contemporáneos heavy, Bowie y equipo no están en la misma frecuencia del sonido duro de principios de los 70's, exceptuando la densa She Shook me Cold, único momento en que el grupo suena más cercano a bandas como Black Sabbath.<br />La voz de Bowie no tiene mucho en común con la de un Plant, Gillan u Osbourne, privilegiando siempre la teatralidad y artificialidad pareciendo por momentos surgida de otro mundo. El sintetizador Moog por su parte le imprime a algunos temas un toque cósmico y futurista, en particular a la espectacular Saviour Machine, perfecto conjunción de hard y rock progresivo. También hay toques sicodélicos como ocurre en All the Madman o el tema que da nombre al disco, verdadero clásico con un aura enigmática, lo mismo que la gótica The Supermen, donde la voz de Bowie suena más extraña que nunca entre medio de épicos golpes de batería y latigazos de guitarra, un perturbador cierre para un disco imperdible.
B000002ACR|5.0|CW plays not only on &quot;Have You Seen Her Face&quot;, but that's his signature lead on &quot;Time Between&quot;. This is his first appearance on a Byrds album.
B00005YW4H|4.0|Norah Jones' debut CD is quite a package.  She has a wonderful voice, wonderful piano playing, and overall wonderful talent.  However, she has not lived up to her potential.  By now, she could have had another CD out, or at least in the works -- a solo work.  She has talent seeping out of her fingertips, and she doesn't make use of it.<BR>In comparison, Tori Amos puts out many singles per CD and most are popular to her listeners.  She4 has good promotors, and gets lots of airplay.  I have not heard Norah get airplay in months.  What is wrong with this picture?
0156711427|2.0|I had to read this book in 10th grade for my history class and it was one of the worst, most confusing books that I have ever read in my entire life. For one, it was very difficult to understand who was talking because Forster's narration was incorrectly phrased, in my opinion. Secondly, all types of foreign vocabulary was introduced to me, and lastly--Forsters whole way of writing was just too complex. Then to add to all this, the story was not interesting at all. Who (but boring people, of course) cares about those boring people anyway. Maybe I didn't like the book because it was so difficult and I was not grasping the deeper meaning behind it. All I know is that this book was certainly not my cup of tea.
B000066NW0|2.0|Avril Lavigne burst onto the pop scene with &quot;Complicated&quot; and the lyrics are written herself.  No wonder!  I qam not bashing her, I am trying to say she is immature.  She has the angst of Alanis Morissette's &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; but nowhere near the talent Morissette has.  Although young, she has mucvh to learn.  She may have lots to say, however, she needs to taget a more alternative listening group rather than teenie-boppers who wants to be &quot;punk rockers&quot;.  She refuses the teen pop title, and insists she is alternative style.  Lavigne needs to grow up, and so does her music.
B00005JLXE|3.0|I give this movie 3.5 stars, because it is a well done film, and is much better than Spiderman.  Allfeck does a great job fitting the role of a blind person.  The well known actors in the movie also help it move along without anyone taking a role that they shouldn't.  No one is overpowering in the film, and the script was done to a good standard.  The plot: much like a comic book!  This movie (and DVD) is fit for most, and is enjoyable to watch.  Hopefully all other comic films follow suit.
B000069HK2|2.0|Let me start by saying that the used are nothing new, screaming and vocalization can be found in other bands, such as In Flames and Iced Earth, and they've been doing it alot earlier.  Okay, if you've seen my other reviews, they're normally not good, check out Avril's CD, and the Used by far are the best band I've rated, because I havent rated any of my favortites.  But nonetheless, the USed are semi okay.  All the reviews are good so I thought it would be worth buying, but my neighbor played it for me and I'm glad I didn't
0140042520|5.0|Man, I don't know where to start. \\"The Dharma Bums\\" is a masterpiece of the Beat Generation and a novel I will not soon forget. After The Loser's Club by Richard Perez, this is the best book I've read all year.<br />Jack Kerouac wrote this story about his days as a Zen Buddhist and rucksack wanderer. His alias in the book is Raymond Smith, and he is living in Berkley with his good buddy Alvah Goldbook(Allen Ginsburg). Ray meets a Zen Lunatic named Japhy Ryder(Gary Snyder), and together they travel the mountains and pastures of Central California trying to find themselves and find the true meaning of life. Ray also journies to Desolation Peak in Washington and lives there alone for the summer, which is just another chapter to this amazing piece of literature.<br />Another part of this book that impressed me was the beginning, when Kerouac wrote about his experience at the San Francisco Poetry Renaissance, and spoke of Alvah Goldbook's first reading of his poem \\"Wail\\", which in reality was Allen Ginsburg's legendary first reading of \\"Howl\\", which to this day is a Beat Literature classic. <br />While reading this book, I was constantly marking lines and passages, because some of the descriptions and poetry Kerouac included in this novel are simply amazing. \\"The Dharma Bums\\" is one of those books I will treasure forever and read over and over again.
B00009W0WM|5.0|CASABLANCA is one of the quintessential great American films. Truly a timeless masterpiece. I'm not eloquent enough to rhapsodize its virtues here, except to say that long after the tripe that passes for screen entertainment today is forgotten, CASABLANCA will still be wowing audiences.<br />Warner Bros.' previous DVD of the film was quite nice, but this new super-deluxe Double Disc boxed set is amazing. I have never seen the film look so stunningly beautiful. I didn't think it was possible, but the brilliant technical wizards at the movie studio have given it a glimmer and shine without removing any of its original look. It sounds terrific, too!<br />As if that weren't enough, the extras are just luscious. Two terrific documentaries hosted by the still-knockout Lauren Bacall, a cool radio version, a bizarre TV re-working, and even the Looney Tunes crew show up in a parody. You also get outtakes, deleted scenes, and audio sessions where you get to hear Dooley Wilson record his immortal AS TIME GOES BY...two different ways!<br />Hats off to Warner Bros. for another stellar release that defines the highest standard classics deserve on DVD!
0553382179|5.0|I am a brand new flybaby.  My sink has been shiny for about 3 weeks now and I am beginning to step out and fly in other areas.  My family has begun to be blessed and notice the difference.  It is so nice to come home and be happy to be home.  My husband now does not walk in the door in a bad mood but comes in the door to a shiny sink and a happy home.  I was never trained by my mom to do basic cleaning and home care.  Thank you so much Marla for setting things out so simply that it makes housework fun and easy.  Don't let anyone get you down.  You have made such a difference in many lives.  God bless you Marla!

B00008S2VG|5.0|I am very surprised at how many people dislike this album!  While I don't think it is her best work, I do think it is great.  It is definately an album that requires one to listen to it in solitude.  If you are looking for &quot;happy, peachy&quot; music, stay away from this album.  But if you are in the mood to be introspective and thoughtful, whether or not you agree with what Madonna crtiques, buy it or borrow it from a friend.  I bought it and I have &quot;absolutely no regrets.&quot;
0140157352|5.0|This is a very good book about how to work out agreements with other people.  The authors start off saying that many people negotiate some where along a spectrum of easy or hard negotiating, either they are willing to get along and often may give up something they really want, or they will push and push for what they want.  The authors say it is better to stay back and figure out what is a fair deal for both sides.  For example in buying a car you would look at what other people are paying for a similar model and number of miles.  Or in getting a job the salary should be competitive with other people with similar backgrounds.  The key point is to try and find ways to decide if an agreement is fair.  <BR> The method is basically:<br />1) Separating the people from the problem<BR>2) Focusing on the interests, not positions<BR>3) Inventing options for mutual gain<BR>4) Insisting on using objective criteria
B000066NW0|5.0|ok so what if she's not punk? and so what if she can't play the guitar? and so what if she used to be a prep (people change)? people are judging HER not her music, and acording to me her album rocks!! I know every single word to every song and I never get tired of listening to her cd unlike others, and THAT is how you tell it's good music (if you can listen to it a billion times and never get bored with it). I can also relate to most of her songs and I can never get her tunes out of my head after listening to it. So I recomend you buying her album.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|This is a brutally realistic, harrowing, must see movie for all parents of teenage children.  Watch this movie WITH your child and be ready for the intense conversation about the perils of drug addiction it will provoke.  I realize there is an explicit sex scene at the end of the movie, but it is an accurate depiction of the depths to which a desperate addict will sink.  I have watched this incredible movie with my daughter and honestly feel it will forever affect the way she perceives drug addiction.<br />Having said all that, this is a movie that will jar you to the core of your soul, especially if you have any prior experience with drug addiction.  Be prepared to think about this movie for a long time after seeing it.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina's new album is proving that she is not that fake pop singer and there is more to her than just looks and a great voice. My favorite song is \\"A Voice Within\\" you are wrong if you say that that song makes no sense and is a little freaky. Have you listened to the lyrics?? and you are wrong if you say songs like \\"Dirrty\\" and \\"Get mine, Get yours\\" is an imature way to prove her adulthood, have the thought that she wants to sing about it come across your mind? Well I think that her 2nd album deserves 5 stars and i recomend buying her cd.
B00003CXXM|1.0|Anyone who thought this was good must have worked on the film or worked for the studio. It was the most boring and poorly acted film I've seen in years. Matt: &quot;The Battle of Shaker Heights&quot; could actually be better then this.
B000002H2H|5.0|my favorite metallica album, this is metallica at their best, ride the lightning and master of puppets are the best 2 metal albums every made, if u dont own either and u call urself a metal fan, u dont know what metal is. this ones more raw and thrashy than puppets, but not as thrashy as kill em all but better produced, every song on here is a classic, not one bad song.<BR>fight fire with fire- 8.5/10, great opener, starts out soft then explodes with thrash!<BR>ride the lightning- 10/10 classic, i luv the beginning of this<BR>for whom the bell tolls- 10/10 possibly the greatest metallica song, not to argue though, there r way to many great metallica songs to compare it to, but its up there<BR>fade to black- 10/10 awesome! more melodamtic metallica, this is a true classic.<BR>trapped under ice-9/10 this is good, thrashy metallica<BR>escape- 8/10 possibly the weakest on the album, still good though.<BR>creeping death-10/10 incredible, another classic about moses, this is another one of the greats of metallica<BR>call of ktulu-9/10 great instrumental, but with the other instrumentals by metallica it falls short in my opinion, orion and to live or die r better, i think, to live r die does have a few lyrics.
0385335482|5.0|...if you don't relate to Bex in some way or another, you're not a female. I think we all have a little Bex in all of us. And all of us Bex's could use someone like Suze, Bex's best friend, not to judge us, and let us be us, no matter how off-beat we can be sometimes. Great read, quick read, and very entertaining. You won't won't to put the book down. I know I didn't.
B00005JLR1|3.0|We rank this 19 out of the 50 Disney animated movies we own.  The scifi theme on an old movie idea, excellent artwork, good CG and good action help elevate this movie to a solid 3 star effort.  Definitely and enjoyable movie but we can't go higher than 19th, given the quality of the movie 18 movies we liked even better.
B00005O3VC|5.0|This is my favorite album of all time.  From Bring Out Your Dead, to the castle anthrax, this dvd will keep you laughing the whole time.  The features are sweet too. check out the LEGO version of the song &quot;Camelot&quot;.  I reccomend this to any comedy fan
B00009NHC5|3.0|I remember this movie differently to what I saw the other night. It didn't have the same impact that it once did.  Nonetheless, the film remains a classic cemeted by Audrey Hepburn's fine performance as a blind woman who is been harrassed over a doll containing drugs.  It doesn't have as much scare value as one would hope, but worth seeing for the fact that is was a very successful play for a number of years.  The biggest let-down is the slowness of the film.  It seems to take ages for anything exciting to really happen, and when it does, it disappoints in a way. Perhaps that is contributable to it been made in 1966 - shock values were different then.  I still think the best scene is when Suzi returns home and the three crooks are in the apartment.  She can feel a presence but is not sure.  <br />DVD SUMMARY:<BR>Warner Bros have cleaned up the film, although a level of grain seems persistent throughout the entire film.  The extras include a 8 minute (whoopee) featurette which mainly talks with Audrey's then husband Mel Ferrer and Alan Arkin (the main crook).  Considering it has taken Warners so long to release this film to DVD, the special features are somewhat disappointing, but better than nothing I guess.
B000021YQV|4.0|System of a Down is a great band because unlike everyone else their sound is so original.  You can't compare them to any other band.  Their lyrics are meaningful and are often humorous.  This band is fast and loud and will make you crank it up and slam your head.
B0000009LG|5.0|THIS IS A CLASSIC ALBUM AND ONE YOU OUGHT TO HEAR AGAIN AND AGAIN. Smooth, polished, perfect -- if David Bowie had emerged from the primordial goo of 60s/70s music to deliver only this single album (as opposed to his Picasso-like eternal rock brilliance) he would still be considered a genius.<br /><br /> For someone to term this album &quot;plastic&quot; is an abomination. This is brilliant work, satisfying on several levels at once, not the least of which is the joy of hearing the stellar production and playing throughout the album. The arrangements will have you out of your seat with joy, shouting out the open front door to the neighbors to get over here and listen to this, no, wait, I'll just turn it up. It's *exciting* how good this music is.<br /><br /> There's one point in &quot;Win&quot; where the background singers, Bowie, and the bass line are all happening and it's a kind of vortex or singularity that delivers all that music has to offer, I mean they really grab the gold ring and bring it home to show Grandma. This album is so good that I've never objected to the horn charts, which always irritate me otherwise. It's a beautifully crafted album, truly a work of art.<br /><br /> Yes, &quot;Across The Universe&quot; blows monkey chunks. Listen, not every oyster you slice open is going to contain a pearl, you know what I mean..? And I heard &quot;Young Americans&quot; often enough in high school to really never want to hear the song again, though 25 years on it's not half as bad as I recall.<br /><br /> The combination of Win &gt; Fascination &gt; Right &gt; Somebody Up There stands as the vital, beating heart of the album. Excellent for slow f*cking. This album is like the Seventh Cavalry riding over the mountain to save the day, this album is like Charlemagne or King Arthur's Camelot riding up to your house on horseback with nothing but good news. Boundless riches.<br /><br /> Can he sing the blues? Don't stray. This is an excellent album, well worth the price. You will never regret having purchased it. There are more visceral and more forgettable Bowie albums, but this is the most elegant and refined rock album that God has so far seen fit to release to the general public (you and me).<br /><br /> Note from 2004: DB is apparently mortal after all, having had a stent installed in a heart procedure this year. Difficult to believe. Anyone that's reached the stratospheric heights like David Bowie has hit musically ought to be immune from death... what a genius. This album is irrefutable proof of his staggering talent. David Bowie defines what a rock star is. You have GOT to hear this album!rchased it.

B00009RGBS|5.0|When I saw the Chicago trailer when I saw Sweet Home Alabama I was so excited for it to come to theaters. As time went on it started comin out in select places and finally it came to a theater near where I live. So I went to go see it with a friend who was just as excited to see it as I was. I had never seen Chicagoon broadway  so I wasnt sure what I was going to see. All I knew is that it had gotten GREAT reviews and the trailer looked pretty cool. I came out of the theater very pleased and humming Nowadays. I saw it three more times and everytime I seem to enjoy it more and I cannot wait until August 19! I have become so obsessed with this movie, I bought the movie book and the soundtrack which I listen to almost everyday. I just cant get enough of it. If you are the kind of person that is very uptight about morals this probably isnt the movie for you. But if you let yourself loose then you wont have a problem with it. Most of you who havent seen it probably think it is a drama, it's actually more of a comedy. A dark comedy mind you. Cell Block Tango and We Both Reached For The Gun and a few other songs  are supposed to make you laugh. The cast is amazing, Renee can sing. No, shes not the best but did you expect that  every good actress to be able to sing perfect too? Catherine is awesome and is easily my favorite actress, she charecter is my favorite too. Velma is bold and sarcastic and isnt afraid to tell you what she thinks of you. Queen Latifah was so comical! Dying her hair blonde, that was hilarious, I was giggling through that whole entire scene. John C Riely is good, but through the whole movie I kept thinking \\"A[...] Amos\\" Richard Gere was also surprisingly good, as was his is singing. This movie proves itself to be a true classic which will be remembered for years to come.
B000002H33|5.0|This song is, in this reviewer's  opinion, the best thing that thrash metal has ever produced.  This IS speed metal.  Battery is set at a break-neck tempo that will make you want to pick up speed until you're at around 200mph, so I would be careful with this CD while driving.  The lyrics to &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;, &quot;Disposable Heroes&quot; and &quot;Sanitarium&quot; show what I think was Hetfield's finest hour, lyrically.  The title track of this album is an 8 minute 38 second rock opera. The only weaker song is Damage Inc., and I admit that I havent listened to it as much as the others so I may be remembering wrong.  But in the end, this album rocks harder then anything being put out today.  If you own one Metallica album it should be this one.
B000077VR3|3.0|This movie is hard to rate with stars because I think it deserves 3 and a half stars. This movie was good but there were annoying moments!! The first 30 minutes or so are confusing and akward. I didnt like the tango scene which everyone else seemed to like. I was just so eager to see what was next for Satine &amp; Christian and then they just start some dumb, pointless tango scene. The movie would've been better without it. The overall story was pretty good. It made me cry and a few parts made me laugh... A very select few. Another problem may be is that I saw Chicago(the best movie in the WORLD) before I saw Moulin Rouge and Moulin Rouge just didnt live up to my expectations! Oh well.... its a pretty good movie! So I suggest you rent it before you go and buy it.
6305907145|3.0|As a longtime fan of Jane Austen I was glad to finally see a movie version of one of my favourite books. However, I was very disappointed with the way Fanny was portrayed. Not that the acting was poor but the script did not depict the characters as I recall them. <BR>If you watch this without reading the book you will come away with a somewhat spiced-up version of the story, and to be honest, considering the type of person that this film is likely to attract (i.e. an Austen fan), I don't think the spice was at all necessary; but then it's never pleasant to see something you like changed!
0140067477|5.0|On a day when I was feeling particularly (oh dear, I hate to say this) sullen - I picked up the Tao of Pooh to soothe my spirit. As always, I was charmed by the Pooh stories (they take me back to when it was - or seemed to be, so much simpler to be alive), and soothed by the Taoist principles Hoff explains through the stories. I've had The Tao of Pooh for a few years now, and I always know that solace is to be found in its pages. It never fails to work a wonderfully simple magic.
B00006V9A0|5.0|Nirvana's &quot;Nirvana&quot; is a greatest hit album with a new song, that has finnally had the chance to see the light of day. This album should serve as a starting point for anyone who loves good music and is looking to get into Nirvana. Nirvana still has the power and innovative style that made them famous.
B000089RVX|5.0|If there's one word to describe evanescence it's that, powerful. The sound of Amy Lee's voice, the effort each band member puts forth, the meaning of their lyrics, the feeling they put into their songs, the vibrations your speakers will make when you crank this cd up --all powerful.<BR>Each and every one of their songs is beautiful, unique, and filled with passion. Evanescence has proven to people that they are more than just another metal band screaming and taking there anger out on their instruments, they are a genuine band that gives the emotion that songs need in order to reach out and grab people. Evanescense is more than a passing fad, their music has made an impact and will have a place on the list of music that's considered \\"classic\\"<BR> <BR>If you like them from what you've heard on the radio or whatever, fine, download that one song that the radio is trying (and failing) to destroy by overplaying. But if you feel the passion that's in their music, get the CD and create a haven for yourself every time you listen to it.
B00005JL78|5.0|This movie is excellent. Everything about it is done well from Steven Spielberg's innovative and colorful directing, to the special effects which propel the story, and a plot that seems in touch with the times, when paranoia takes control and takes away our privacy.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Not only could I totally relate to this CD but the music is just fab.    I love Christina's new style and boldness.
B0000508U6|5.0|Coldplay's first album &quot;Parachutes&quot; is a very entertaining and fresh album. It is good to find a group that does not sound like everyone else and can be slow and calm yet not boring. I have listend to it numerous times and it does not repeat itself or get stale, it is entertaing start to finish.
B00005JLXE|3.0|This ranks near the bottom of the movies made from Marvel Comics in the past few years.  Despite that, it's a solid little movie.  It never soars, and it stumbles on a few occasions, but at the end it emerges as well worth the time.  My main comlaint would be that the movie is too short; it could have been, and probably should have been, a half hour longer.  That way, there might have been a bit more time for real characterization.  As is, the characters just sort of move from one scene to the next, and we are expected to sort of fill in the blanks for ourselves.  That the characters manage to live and breathe at all is a real testament to some fine acting.  Ben Affleck, whom I expected to suck in this role, is outstanding as the conflicted title hero; Jennifer Garner shows Elektra's soft side as well as her angry, vengeful side; Michael Clarke Duncan is largely wasted as the Kingpin, but is believable as a crime lord; and Colin Farrell is truly psychotic as Bullseye, although I'd like to have some idea of why he is so nuts.  Another complaint I'd like to register is that some of the wirework and CGI is awful.  On the other hand, some of it is very good.<br />The extras are pretty good.  There are two nearly hour-long documentaries.  My favorite was the one that focuses on the comic-book history and development of Daredevil.  It's a shame that more movies adapted from other media don't pay this much reespect to their source material.<br />This is not a perfect movie, but if you like superhero flicks, you should definately give it a shot.
B000092ZYX|4.0|Radiohead as always been a group that you either get or you don't. And &quot;Hail To The Theif&quot; is no exception. The album,  filled with political comments and such, manages to deliver a good listen, with some tracks takeing a rock approach, while others going into depressing electronic sound. A great album that should not be missed.
B00005JKNC|4.0|This was an excellent movie.  No normal Jim Carrey hijinks or toilet humor here.  Although the writers took some liberties with the red scare and mcarthy trials, and the amnesia bit has been done before.  This movie is on a different level though.  The ideas this movie gives you are strong true ideas.  You are what society wants you to be, be that communist or MIA war hero.  This movie does a very good job of honoring the military as well and thanking them for the price they pay for freedom.  It was a very good, very engaging movie that can be watched by the whole family.
B000069AUI|5.0|&quot;A Rush Of Blood To The Head&quot;, the second album from Coldplay is just a great as the first one, &quot;Parachutes&quot;. This album however is slightly more upbeat and faster moving than the band's first album, which gives it a fresh edge. I listen to this CD quite often and it has yet to loose it's power.
0553382179|5.0|I've never liked being told what to do...I've never liked organization books or ideas, but Marla's book has made my home a happy, comfortable place to be.  God bless flylady.  If you have ever felt lost, looked around your house in disgust, cleaned all day but got nothing done, or turned away your friends and family b/c your house was such a mess (or pretended that you weren't home like I did), Sink reflections is for you...You just have to be willing to read it all and make a change.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Audioslave's self titled debut is a great album filled a good dose of adrenaline filled rock. The group which is made up of ex-Soundgarden and ex-Rage Against The Machine members make a new sound for themselves here and the result is an album entertaing from start to finish.
B00005JKN9|2.0|I didn't go see the movie when it was at the theaters.  My ancestors came from Donegal and County Tyrone, Ireland.  There were so many wonderful contributions the Irish made when they came to America.  They did backbreaking work for low pay and had to prove that they weren't all lazy, wild, drunks.  Just when we think we may lose this kind of stereotype Mr. Scorsese makes this movie making the Irish look like crazy, fighting, murdering, cannabalistic, barbarians.  I can imagine that Italian-Americans felt the same way while watching &quot;Goodfellas&quot;, Mr. Scorsese!  Don't do any of us any favors!
B00007BH5C|4.0|Howard Shore won the Oscar for his soundtrack to &quot;The Fellowship Of The Ring&quot; and I was worried that with these one he would basically have the same score with the same themes and the same sound. But I was surprised to discover new themes as well as old and the album sounded fresh.
B000002AZ8|4.0|Pearl Jam delivers another great performance with their 3rd album. Eddie joins the all ready potent twin guitar attack with some nice riffs of his own. The sound is crisp and the songswriting for the most part is very tight. They do misfire for the first time with some very horrible noise experiments. This was their last blockbuster album at a time when they could do no wrong. Nothingman and Betterman are rated a litle low in my personal ratings but be aware that they are both among the most popular songs in the Pearl Jam catalog.<BR>1. Last Exit 9/10<BR>2. Spin the Black Circle 8/10<BR>3. Not for You 10/10<BR>4. Tremor Christ 10/10<BR>5. Nothingman 8/10<BR>6. Whipping 8/10<BR>7. Pry To 5/10<BR>8. Corduroy 10/10<BR>9. Bugs 1/10<BR>10. Satans Bed 8/10<BR>11. Better Man 8/10<BR>12. Aye Davanita 6/10<BR>13. Immortality 10/10<BR>14. Stupid Mop 1/10<br />Overall this is a great album despite some filler. This is a perfect album for anyone who likes rock music.
B00005JM1F|4.0|I was not expecting a high quality of humour when I got this, but I was pleasently surprised. The movie, which is laugh out loud funny is only helped by the wonderful acting and characterzation filled within this movie.
B000002BFZ|4.0|Pearl Jam's 4th studio album will either make you or break you as a Pearl Jam fan. Released after grunge music died this album showcases Pearl Jam continuing to evolve and play by their own rules. Yes it isn't as rocking as their first three great albums though it is still a really good album. The lyrics get more personal and the music much more experimental. Some of my favorite songs are on this album. Perhaps it doesn't have any truly great songs like their earlier work though they are still good songs and they play better than most rock bands out there. Casual Pearl Jam fans might not like this album. True fans however will appreciate this work even if Pearl Jam no longer is the multiplatinium powerhouse they were in the early 90s.<br />1. Sometimes 8/10 Nice quiet album opener.<br />2. Hail Hail 9/10 Great song that blows out your speakers!<br />3. Who You Are 8/10 Great polyrythmn drumming.<br />4. In My Tree 9/10 One of the best songs and great if you ever feel depressed.<br />5. Smile 7/10 Nice slow churner that sounds like Neil Young.<br />6. Off He Goes 8/10 Very good acoustic song.<br />7. Habit 8/10 Once again they blow out your speakers!<br />8. Red Mosquito 8/10 Great opening solo and good song.<br />9. Lukin 9/10 If this was a full song it would be a 10 and one of their best songs.<br />10. Present Tense 1/10 Starts off really slow and boring. The rocking end isn't that bad though.<br />11. Mankind 6/10 Average midtempo rocker with an 80s feel.<br />12. I'm Open 1/10 Weak arty song.<br />13. Around the Bend 9/10 One of my favorite songs. Great acoustic guitars and laidback pace.<br />After this album Pearl Jam are in an enviable position. They've sold millions of albums but now the hype has died down and they release great music that their true fans can appreciate without all the craziness that comes with being the \\"cool\\" band of the moment. They play what they want to play and tour how they want to and make a great living without being pretenious rockstars or sellouts. Get this album because Pearl Jam is a great band.
B00008J4P5|5.0|&quot;Elephant&quot; the latest album from the Detroit duo The White Stripes is a great album and should not be missed. From the first addicting and fresh track to the last, this album will be sure to keep you entertained, and gives hope that rock may recover from the terrible state it is in now.
1891252089|3.0|this book got very good yoga information and very good self taught book, but i rather prefer or recommand astanga yoga by john scott, reader maybe feel curious about my opinion, because the binding of this book is &quot;spiral-bound&quot; because the spiral-bound is too small and very easy distort, this is the reason i just give 3 star.
B00005QIPH|5.0|There is only one thing I can say about this album and that is that it is the single greatest 35+ minutes of music that i have ever heard. If you only buy one more album for the rest of your life, this should be it. There is no a single bad moment on this CD. Sure there are many other great albums you could buy and be completly happy with:<BR>(&quot;Ok Computer&quot;, &quot;Revolver&quot;, &quot;London Calling&quot;, &quot;Nevermind&quot; to name a few) but i guarantee that anyone who even thinks of considering themselves a rock and roll fan will find this album amazing.<br /> In fact the only sensible complaint that I have ever heard about The Strokes is that they sound too much like other older bands (i.e. The Velvet Underground, Television, etc.) but I say &quot;SO WHAT!&quot;  How does that have anything to do with whether they are good or not? If that's the way you choose to look at it why would you listen to anyone besides the Beatles and the Stones.
B000089RVX|5.0|I loved this CD and recommend it to all my friends.  I especially liked the songs &quot;Tourniquet&quot;, &quot;Imaginary&quot; (which kind of just flows on from &quot;Tourniquet&quot;) and &quot;Hello&quot;.  When Amy sings the part that goes &quot;Suddenly, I know I'm not sleeping.  Hello, I'm still here!  All that's left of yesterday...&quot; and hits those really high notes, it gives me chills to this very day, even though I've listened to it more than a hundred times.  Oh, it is SO great!<br />However, when I saw Evanescence perform live on the Jay Leno show, they sounded utterly horrific.  So bad, in fact, that I had to change the channel off of it.  The music sounded amateurish, and Amy's voice sounded just plain awful.  She couldn't hit any of her high notes, even though they played &quot;Going Under&quot; in a much lower key for her, was way off-pitch on all the other notes, and sounded a lot like she'd been drinking alcohol or something, which is extremely dehydrating and a singer's #1 enemy.  I hope that's not true.<br />Also, she was just about drowned out by the strangely wrongly-played guitar.  Where did THOSE freaky chords come from?  Uh, it sounded totally different than the perfect and pristine version on the CD.  If they rehearsed this performance, the sound guy was falling down on the job big-time, and the band obviously didn't know how to play the song correctly.<br />I really hope she sounded as good as the CD sounds when she was in the studio, and wasn't electronically enhanced to sound good.  I'm certainly willing to give them another chance at a good live performance, but only once more.  After that, I'll stick to their CDs only.  My ears can take only so much torture and abuse.
B000002KHH|5.0|Almost all of Black Sabbath's musics which became a &quot;Rock'n Roll Legend&quot; are on this CD. In fact, the songs you'll find in this album are a must when Black Sabbath chooses to play LIVE, no matter where they are, or where they will play it. Even Ozzy himself nowadays finishes all his shows with the &quot;Paranoid&quot; song, which, by the way, if yo've never listened to it, you are no Heavy Metal fan. A must buy CD, this is the first one to go if youre looking forward to starting a black sabbath collection.
B000067IZ3|5.0|I don't really know why people insist that the film is about drug trade! I think the film is about humans and their hopes and defects: A very powerful man with no weapon to protect his daughter, a nouveau-rich hot shot who is suddenly in jail, a spoon fed beauty running for money and a superb policeman hoping to provide something for the childhood.<br />The way the film has been &quot;woven&quot; is pretty rare in the new films (it looks like the well-made movies we use to see in the 60's and 70s), and the hazy impression of a fine movie by its humanity (and not graphic) may remind us that Hollywood is still in good shape.<br />A salute to Michael Douglas for taking one step back offering the axial role for Benicio Del Toro: I don't think that anyone else could represent the 3rd world pure and simple man, looking for fairness, as he did.<br />The characters and the stories of the movie could make at least 3 successful movies; this is in case you would not consider the amazing shooting on Mexico, who could be considered as a masterpiece on its own, as a fourth successful movie. <br />It doesn't really matter what is your interest in movies, whether it is the gender, the directors, the stars or simply the entertainment; you should see the movie and considered as a reference (it will make you very picky).
B00009V7P8|5.0|Rice delivers a great album consisting of 10 beautiful songs.  He reminds me of another rising star who has finally hit it big-David Gray.  I recommend this CD to anyone-no matter what genre they follow.  My personal favorites are &quot;Cannonball&quot; and &quot;Volcano&quot;.  They show real feelings in what Rice is trying to convey.
B00008AY3L|5.0|Ben Harp has a very good furture ahead of him if you ask me. i can listen to the hole cd and fell this greatness about my self. There is this one song title, When she believes, which i think is the best song on the album. buy it is worth you hard earn money.
B000003TA4|4.0|Nevermind is a good rock record. MOst every song is good and many times very catchy (Lounge Act always gets stuck in my head whenever I listen to it). The singles from Nevermind are incredible. My personal favorite is In Bloom because it's catchy and the video for it is the best. Drain You is another favorite. But there are some definite problems with the CD.<br />My main problem I have is that Nevermind's two biggest songs, Smells Like Teen Spirit and Come As You Are, aren't completely original. I'm not saying Nirvana just swiped other band's riffs intentionally, they probably didn't, but who knows. <br />Every one knows Teen Spirit sound kind of like Boston's More Than a Feeling and the Pixies' Debaser. That's alright though I'm over it. <br />But the song Come As You Are another massive hit (and usually people's favorite Nirvana song) isn't all that original. Come As You Are has a very similar riff as the Killing Joke song called Eighties. <br />Maybe it's just coincidence that two Nirvana songs sound kind of like other songs, but it's something that I can't really ignore either.<br />Other than that Nevermind is pretty good. It's really poppy and doesn't sound like any other Nirvana record.
B000002UQJ|4.0|I remember a lot of people not liking this album for the exact reasons it's such a strong entry in McCartney's discography--it's an exceptionally clean pop album, perhaps too clean for those who like his more ragged (though no less charming) efforts such as &quot;Flaming Pie&quot; or &quot;McCartney&quot;.  What makes this album an even greater effort is the fact that the songs themselves are not lost in the candy-coated mix.  There are songs of great substance here, like &quot;Hope of Deliverance&quot; and &quot;Looking for Changes&quot;; there are great rock 'n roll songs, like &quot;Biker Like an Icon&quot; and &quot;Get out of My Way&quot;; and, of course, great McCartney ballads: &quot;Winedark Open Sea&quot;, &quot;I Owe it All To You&quot;.  This album is a great progression from &quot;Flowers in the Dirt&quot;.  My wish is that Paul would have kept this band together for a few more albums.  It's certainly the best group of musicians he's surrounded himself with as a solo artist.
B000000WJZ|5.0|I know it is kind of pointless to say that this album is great, but I will say it anyway. Siamese Dream is great. <br />For one thing, it is incredibly diverse for a 13 track record. You have your classic rockers like Cherub Rock, Quiet, Today, Geek U.S.A., and Silverfck. You also have beautiful songs such as Disarm, Soma, Mayonaise (which is probably the best song on the CD), and Luna. There are also slow burners that only the Smashing Pumpkins could have pulled off like Hummer and Rocket. So as you can see, there is a little bit for everyone.<br />Another thing, ALL the songs are really well written and produced.<br />Also, there really isn't any filler. Although some people may consider Sweet, Sweet filler, I don't.<br />BEST SONGS(according to me)<BR>1.) Mayonaise<BR>2.) Today<BR>3.) Geek U.S.A.<BR>4.) Hummer<BR>5.) Cherub Rock<br />I'd reccommend this to people with open minds and to people who just like 90's pop rock.
B000092ZYX|5.0|I would first like to say that this album has changed my outlook on life, and now belive there is hope for alternative music after all. But you have to have an open mind for a brilliant album like this, if you don't have an open mind I suggest you buy a limbiskit album. I noticed on some reviews of this album people said that Radiohead did not fufill their promise of returning to the OK computer days, but that is compleatly untrue, guitars are dominant throughout the album. If they wanted a record that sounded exactly like OK computer they would have called it OK computer 2. The fact is that every record is going to be different thats what makes it unique. If you are a true radiohead fan you will not be the least bit dissapointed!

B00004Y6NU|2.0|After three more or less great albums, Dire Straits released \\"Love over gold\\" in 1982. This album is not at all comparable to the earlier stuff and only the song \\"Telegraph road\\" reach former heights. In fact, \\"Love over gold\\" is a rather boring album and the material lacks the attractiveness of tunes like \\"Sultans of swing\\" and \\"Tunnel of love\\" to name a few. I would say that this album is mostly for dedicated Dire Straits fans.
B000002VCQ|5.0|I like the entire cd, all the songs are great. My favorites are &quot;Saving all my love for you&quot; and &quot;Thinking about you&quot;<br />In addition to Stretch's comment, I think the extra vocals in &quot;Thinking about you&quot; were performed only by two persons: Jermaine Jackson (I hope so!!, cause I like him very much) or Kashif. But it sounds more like Jermaine, don't you think so?<br />I have nothing else to say, only that Whitney is one of the greatest singers I've ever heard
0156027321|2.0|This book 100 pages to get to the story and is not really worth reading.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|The Matrix Reloaded was one of the best films I have ever seen. I loved not only the action, but also the way the story was told, and the development of the characters throughout the movie. <BR>     Reloaded follows the story of Neo (a.k.a \\"The One\\") and his quest to help Zion win the war against the machines. With him are his partners Trinity and Morpheous and many more characters as they battle their way through the complex world of the The Matrix.<BR>     For anyone who likes intense action and a little romance, (not to mention a little language) Reloaded is the movie you should see.
B000002UAR|5.0|You know right from the beginning this one's different. \\"Taxman\\" starts out REVOLVER with a little social commentary, the jarring guitar in the middle, and the listener's realization that the Beatles are heading in a new direction, and taking everyone else with them. The sadness of \\"Eleanor Rigby\\", punctuated by strings, the sitar on \\"Here, There and Everywhere\\" and \\"Tomorrow Never Knows,\\" even the love song \\"Good Day Sunshine\\" with its old \\"Tin Pan Ally\\" feel to it are sonic adventures; this is a band that has decided to take chances and change what people should expect from music. It is so easy to lose appreciation for how dynamic this must have sounded when it first was released. There had never really been anything like it. And you know what? It still is just as vital today.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Good Lord this album is good! It's like vintage Soundgarden mixed with some old fashioned Zeppelin riffs by way of Rage Against the Machine. Now, that made no sense, but thats not the point. This rises above the &quot;whine rock&quot; that prevails on radio these days, without evocking the unjustified anger and hardness of death metal to reach a plateau of hard rock that's not too hard. &quot;Cochise&quot;, &quot;Show Me How to Live&quot;, and &quot;I Am the Highway&quot; are the three best songs in my opinion, but others, including &quot;Like A Stone&quot;, &quot;Getaway Car&quot; and &quot;Gasoline&quot; are right up there. People, this is simply great, great music. I was a big Soundgarden fan back in the day, so maybe I'm a bit biased, but I think anyone who likes good hard rock and roll should love &quot;Audioslave&quot;
0684800713|5.0|As recounted in Hemingway's memoir \\"A Moveabe Feast\\", none other than Gertrude Stein was very critical of Hemingway's earlier works and gave him some disparaging criticism. Over 80 years have passed, and Hemingway is still widely read today, and with good reason: the man was a born writer.<br />Hemingway's first novel is a story of the \\"lost generation\\"; those who came of age during World War 1 and lived as expatriates in Paris.  The hero of the story is Jake Barnes, a man suffering from a bad injury during the war and his relationships.  Never boring, the book is at its best when the more everyday aspects of life intrude upon the narrative. The characters are all sharply drawn. I was at first worried about the bull-fighting sequences, not because I am opposed to the sport, but because I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to sustain interest, but the passages are so well-written that it's no problem. Hemingway's first is a good place to start to get used to his narrative technique. He's one of the earliest writers I have encountered who can write about \\"nothing\\" and make it Something.
B00003CXCW|1.0|As a longtime fan of Sunset Boulevard, a film which easily rates 6 stars on a scale of 1 to 5, I was extremely disappointed with the DVD collectors' edition.  All of the extra features, including the orginal morgue opening scene which was not included in the theatrically released version, are very nice to see.  However, there is a fundamental problem with the actual movie part of the DVD.  The DVD version of Sunset Boulevard is 110 minutes long but the original release is 115 minutes long.  The original release had practically no fluff in it so the deleted scenes do hurt.  I highly recommend Sunset Boulevard but I cannot recommend this so-called collectors' edition to anyone because it does not include the full length version of the film.
B00003CXB4|5.0|The Lion King is still one of the all time greatest movies ever created. It has plot and emotion. The first time I saw it, I was crying my eyes out! This movie has the ability to touch everybody of any age. Everytime I think of this movie, it brings a tear to my eye as I think of how powerful this movie is. I can't wait for the special platinum edtion to come out.
B000092ZYX|5.0|All the songs on this album are mindblowing. HTTT is a work of art that will be remembered as a classic album that will change rock as Radiohead continues to do.
0783114893|2.0|The reason I bought a DVD player almost four years ago was that I finally saw for myself the drastic increase in picture quality from VHS. I can tolerate DVD releases that skimp on extras like behind the scenes documentaries and director commentary, but I do demand good picture quality. This DVD fails to deliver. It doesn't look too bad when the scenes occur in daylight, but when you reach the point in the story where darkness falls and the scenes were shot at night, the extremely low quality of the film print and digital transfer come shining through. I haven't seen this much grain and artifacting since... well, ever. It's even worse than the \\"gray market\\" DVD of the Twin Peaks pilot episode. Buy if you must, but as for me I wish I'd held out for a better edition.
1573228214|5.0|Rob Fleming is  the owner of a failing record store and has just been left by his girlfriend. His whole life is a mess due to his obsession with music and  him wasting his time with rather unimportant things, for example rearranging his huge record collection every now and again. He is thirty-five years old, single and worried about how his whole life might turn out. Rob wades in depression for a few weeks, but soon discovers what really makes his life worth living.<BR>Most of the characters in \\"High Fidelity\\" have got very intense personalities and can make the reader laugh out loud and feel sorry for them at the same time. They all differ from one another, but nevertheless the characters fit together brilliantly.<BR>The author has got his own, very compulsive but also contemporary style of writing and uses a funny language, which he enriches with some of his own expressions (e.g. the \\"ooh-I-shouldnt-really-but-I-quite-fancy-a-pint sort of weakness\\" (p. 166, ll.17-18)).<BR>Hornby has created a very flowing and intersting story, which reflects every-day life in such a true and comprehensive way, that the reader can just simply nod in agreement. It confronts you with your own fears and doubts and brings back into mind the repressed difficulties of our relationships.<BR>The film to the novel, which is also called \\"High Fidelity\\", plays in Chicago instead of London and parts of the setting, like the record store \\"Championship Vinyl\\", deeply disappointed me. Reading the novel I could just perfectly imagine what the shop would look like, had the story been set in London.<BR>The brilliant cast, great acting and especially the truth, that also lies in the film, manage to make up for the fact, that the story does not take place in one of those familiarly uncrowded back streets of London.<BR>Comparing the film to the novel, I must admit that I much prefer the novel, but I think it is pretty much impossoble to make a film that is good enough to be better than the novel.<BR>Nick Hornby has my deepest respect for the creation of such a beautiful and true story. Marvellous!
0385509456|5.0|My sister was never 'officially' diagnosed with autism, because it was so long ago.  Her doctors always said she had 'autistic-like behaviors'.....after reading this book, I can safely say that my sister is most likely autistic.  She has the exact same characteristics/idiosynchrosies as the main character.  It was very educational and informative.  I recommend this to everyone because, not only will it be interesting to discover what autism is like, it will open people's minds and hopefully allow people to have more patience with autistic people.  Excellent-read it in a day!
B000006MS3|5.0|i am leaps and bounds away from being an obsessive kate bush fan.  i will admit that her music does have sort of a nostalgic hold on me, especially the music from this album.<br />this is undoubtedly the best kate bush album out there.  more people are fond of &quot;hounds of love,&quot; but i think that has more to do with the fact that it was her breakaway hit album.  &quot;the dreaming&quot; is far superior in its scope, songwriting, production, and concept than anything before or after it.  <br />what i really admire about the album is that it is almost a theatrical piece, with a strange and vibrant cast of characters and stories.  she uses her voice in so many different ways and displays an enormous range of musical tastes on this album.  she sings about bank heists gone wrong, intruders, houdini drowning, the moment of death, and many other bizarre and intriguing topics...but with great passion and intensity.  <br />&quot;all the love&quot; is one of my favorite songs that i can think of.  it is a haunting and beautiful song about death, and the things that can haunt you at that moment.  and &quot;houdini&quot; is probably the most theatrical piece of the album, in which she is singing from the perspective of rosabel, who was houdini's stage partner and lover, who would pass a key to him with a kiss.  it is a brilliant song, with beautiful piano and string accents throughout.<br />her song construction is at its most accomplished on this album.  there is a effortless mix of fairlight and keyboard elements, percussion, multi-layered vocals, bass and guitar.  if you listen to the album with good headphones, it is quite a revelation.  she is at her peak here, and although like i mentioned before, most people refer to &quot;hounds of love&quot; as her best, i think that album sounds more dated, even though the songwriting is really just as strong.<br />also check out &quot;never for ever.&quot;  it was the release before this album, and is almost as good.
B000063DIR|1.0|I'm absolutely stunned by what Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne has done to a true metal masterpiece.  I, like many diehard Randy Rhoads fans, went out and bought it, thinking that it would sound better than the original 95 remastered version, not to mention, the &quot;extra&quot; track that lured me into buying this garbage(the extra track, by the way, is the same live version you will find on TRIBUTE. You go figure)  Boy, was I wrong.  Everything about this (re)released album sounds atrociously bad!  The title track, which if you listen to the acoustic part near the end of the song, you'll notice the drum is way out of sync, heavy I might add.  The greatest injustice done to the integrity of the album was the eclipsing of Randy's legendary screaming guitar tone.  It's an insult to Randy's legacy.  I mean the guitar solo part in the end of the title track was droned out and sounds like cr*p!  Every song on this CD was basically MURDERED! If you listen to the 95 version, it is like night and day.  <br />Bottom line:  the Osbournes have gotten very greedy, very sad.  <BR>Please, go out and buy the 95 original Sony 22-bit remastered version.  This one blows the cr*ppy new version away!
B00005JLXE|1.0|I was looking forward to seeing this movie and generally I think well of Ben Affleck. Despite this, it was by far the most disappointing movie I've ever seen.  Is it worth renting?  I suppose.  Worth buying?  No way!<br />The acting was poor and the special effects less than mediocre. (Look towards the upper left corner of your screen to check out the wires holding the young DareDevil when he tests out his skills while sliding down a banister. )<br />The script, dialogue, etc. is all cliche and an insult to intelligent adults yet the movie has too much foul language and is too violent for children.<br />I'm shocked by how many people rated this film well.  They must have very low standards when it comes to entertainment.

B000002KBU|5.0|BLUE was the first Joni Mitchell album I ever heard and she changed my appreciation for music right away.  I was 18 and listening to Joni was refreshing to hear her talent.  Her voice and her chords are brilliantly pieced together and full of feeling. I am now 24 and I own 11 of Joni's albums.  BLUE still reigns as my favorite album of any artist.  Her style in BLUE is stimulating as far as making you think and maybe even making you feel.
0783240287|5.0|There are some actors/actresses who were born to play certain parts, e.g., Yul Brunner and the King of Siam.  Well, Donny Osmond IS Joseph!  After seeing this, I cannot imagine anyone else playing Joseph so well, and so poignantly.  Donny has the truly perfect voice and charisma for this role.  I've have seen brief clips of other stage performances, and have heard the other stage soundtracks, and they just don't have it!  One important thing that seems to be lacking in the previous encarnations is an enthusiasm for the role, something that comes through loud and clear with Donny Osmond.  There simply is no other \\"Joseph\\" than him.  He is truly an underrated performer.<br />It was great choice to film this as a \\"movie\\" on sets, rather than just filming a stage show.  While that would have been interesting, especially to those who had seen the play, it would not have done justice to it the way this did and would not have allowed for the varied staging that is evident here.  The casting is excellent in my opinion, although I understand from several friends who saw the Stage Production here in Boston back in 1996(ish), the Stage Elvis (Johnny Seaton) and Narrator (Janet Metz) had a higher level voice control and stage \\"presence\\" than is so evident here (\\"simply awesome\\" us how one friend put it), the two certainly turn in stellar performances and their performances are entertaining and riviting.  They both have quite good voices, and Pharoah really morphs with Elvis!<br />Given that this play was, at least originally, staged with children in mind, the costuming is a bit on the risque side, and could certainly have been done without.<br />Andrew Lloyd Webber also missed an excellent opportunity that might be missed on most people as far as history and factual storytelling goes.  When approached by \\"Mrs. Potiphar\\", Joseph actually ran away from her, leaving \\"his outer garment behind\\", and she then falsly accused him of attempting to rape her,which is really why Potipar was so enraged.  This would've added a whole other dimension to the song \\"Potiphar\\" and made his false imprisonment all the more \\"unjust\\", which in turn, would have added to the poignancy of Donny's best song in the show, \\"Close Every Door\\", but, hey, that's Hollywood!  ONE WARNING!  This will leave you singing and humming the songs for weeks and weeks on end!<br />Donny Osmond will never again wear that \\"Amazing Coloured Coat\\" but as long as you own this DVD, he'll never really take it off for the last time!<br />By the way, don't pass-up the CD featuring Donny Osmond from this Stage Tour.  It is simply awesome!  In many areas, the tempo and pacing of the songs is better than in this DVD. They make a truly wonderful set!enraged.

0316286443|4.0|In preparation for doing my own makeup on my wedding day, I sought out various resources, which led me to Kevyn Aucoin's books.  While not a self-help manual per se, this book shows the amazing transformations that can come as a result of makeup alone.  I found it very useful for providing an overview of different techniques--for example, the effects of combining light/dark mouth with light/dark eyes; the use of neutral versus more dramatic colors; options for shaping brows, eyes, and lips; etc.  While most of us will never come anywhere near Kevyn's skill level, this book provides at least a starting point for incorporating some professional tips into your own makeup routine.
0312305060|5.0|The Hours is quite possibly the best written novel I have read in years. It fully deserved its Pulitzer.<br />What's great about The Hours is that what's great about The Hours is something different for everyone. Writers and avid readers will appreciate its shockingly unique style. Michael Cunningham sort of trusts us to know what he's talking about. We hear a lot less &quot;Virginia carefully approached the child so as not to alarm her...&quot; and more &quot;She approached the child with caution...&quot; (note: not a direct quote) It's nice to her a lot more pronouns that names and a lot less &quot;she said.&quot; He seems to grasp that we know who he's referring to, allowing the complex story to get on with itself and unfold.<br />People with problems in their lives and people looking for life-assurance will find the provocative power of the book to be of some comfort. If you don't leap from your seat, your heart doesn't stop, or you aren't left to think for (no pun intended) hours after you set the book down, you may want to consider yourself legally dead.<br />Those who feel they are connected to others in the world will find the strings of three women's lives, brilliantly woven and unwoven throughout the book, to be incredible. All the stories are richly intertwined. It's as if Michael Cunningham took a handful of each woman and blew it gently across his pages, writing more of a collage than a novel. Details are sprinkled throughout each woman's life that also appear in another woman's life, showing us that we are not alone in this universe.<br />Brilliant, beautiful, and deep; you must read The Hours!
B00005UOXN|2.0|I've been into Billy Idol since I was six. One of the first albums I ever bought was Rebel Yell. Two of his albums share the distinction of every song being listenable (You pop in the CD/tape and enjoy the whole album, no tracks are worthy of being skipped). I have only 7 albums that have this merit. He has a songwriting ability that has survived the late 70's, 80's and 90's and will continue to endure the ages. <br />I had bought Rebel Yell on cassette a year before buying &quot;Vital Idol&quot; in 1988 and wore Rebel out. Needless to say I was excited to get my hands on &quot;Vital&quot; since it was the only compilation of his work available.  Sadly, I was dissapointed. I never could get into some of songs that were unfamiliar to me. I also didn't like the hideous altered version of &quot;Flesh for Fantasy&quot; on this album. Only when I bought his debut and Whiplash did I hear for the first time that these songs where supurb and realize that this album a pitifully poor attempt to (IMHO) make Chysalis some extra cash.<br />The two stars I am giving this album are in no way reflecting his work or his musical ability. Keep in mind that this album was supposed to capture Billy's masterpieces from 1982-1986. He had more than quite a few of them. However the songs on this album are few and most of his best artistic ability has been left out. Put bluntly this compilation simply insults him as an artist by implying that this album is &quot;Vital&quot; Billy Idol. <br />The songs on the album shouldn't be an insult, they are by all means excellent songs in their ORIGINAL form. However, all but three have been ruthlessly crucified by being the remixing process. Out of the five marred songs, all but one have been remixed by people other than Idol/Stevens (&quot;Flesh for Fantasy&quot;, &quot;Hot In The City&quot;, &quot;To Be A Lover&quot;, and &quot;Love Calling&quot;). The remixed songs have &quot;Make some of Billy's non-danceable hits into danceable ones&quot; writtenall over them. <br />It is then IMHO (Especially to those who are only now discovering him) that your money would better spent on his &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; released in 2001. This superior album has obviously been better planned and has a greater quantity and better variety of his work. There are also outtakes, original demos, and acoustic versions on it. Not to mention that the majority of the songs are the original versions. Those tracks that have been altered, have been by Billy and/or Steve hands not some popular DJ.  <br />Synopsis:<BR>Highlights: <BR>Mony Mony, White Wedding (full version), Dancing with Myself. <BR>(All but the full version of Wedding are on his Greatest Hits)<br />Letdowns: Rebel Yell, Daytime Drama, Eyes, Sweet 16, DOA, Hole In the Wall, Don't need a Gun, and Blue Highway are absent. If they had been present they probably would have gone through the blender too.<br />5 out of 8 songs are re-mixed. 4 of the 5 have been re-mixed by some dance DJ. Comparing the remixes to the originals is like comparing apples and oranges.<br />&quot;Greatest Hits&quot; is a way better alternative for a few extra bucks.<br />If you are a Idol fan, for the love of God, buy his individual albums<br />The rest of the songs are re-mixed, and
B000089RVX|5.0|I bought Fallen about five months ago, and after hundreds of listenings, I'm still finding more things to appreciate about this album.  Amy Lee's beautiful vocals soar like an eagle over the hard rock backing of Ben Moody &amp; Co.  The songs are truly amazing, with a perfect blend of strings, harmonies, and rock.  While the dark overtones of the band may turn some listeners away, it shows what a talent for songwriting the band has.  &quot;Going Under&quot; is a perfect opening song and the current single, with uber-popular &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; right behind it.  The rest of the songs are just as strong, with my personal favorites being &quot;Haunted,&quot; &quot;Tourniquet,&quot; &quot;My Last Breath,&quot; and &quot;Whisper.&quot;  I can't say enough about the quality of this CD, or their live show, which is awesome as well.  &quot;Fallen&quot; is a masterfully crafted emotional ride, and I don't ever want to get off.
B0000640SB|4.0|Loosely based from a 1990 comic book series, this 1997 blockbuster combined eye popping special effects, classic sci-fi fare, and off the wall comedy and featured Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones as Agent's J and K respectively.  Both of whom are members of the MIB: a government organized secret group who keep the knowledge of extra terrestrial life under wraps while keeping the planet at peace.  Director Barry Sonnenfeld handles the film very well and keeps it at a crowd pleasing speedy pace throughout most of it's running time.  While it does start to lose steam towards it's climax, where Men in Black shines is with the casting: featuring Linda Fiorentino, Rip Torn, Tony Shaloub, and Vincent D'Onofrio in lively roles, with D'Onofrio being his usual scene stealing self.  This Deluxe Edition of the film seems like the umpteenth time MIB has been released on DVD; but out of all the previous editions this seems to offer the most bang for your buck.
B000063COX|5.0|This is where it all began. Eddie lives and is driving his message home again and again with a powerful force of rhythm and guitar glory that will keep you tapping your feet and banging your head until the very end.<br />Long live you glorious rockers!
B0000A02U2|5.0|I will finally be able to purchase Animal House on DVD, since it is one of my all-time favorites.<br />I was hoping to originally get it on DVD, but it was out of print, so I paid the $... to get it on tape.<br />It just always seems like a chore to rewind this movie, since I like to watch it a couple times in a row. I WILL NO LONGER HAVE THIS PROBLEM!! In September, I will also be able to get Scarface on DVD, so I will definitely be happy.<br />LIVE LONG AND TOGA!
B00006LI4S|5.0|I was never really a big Pink Floyd fan and my husband always foced me to listen to it all the time.  Then one day he purchased this David Gilmour dvd and I have been hooked ever since!  I can't count how many times I have viewed it.  Roger Gilmour is just a genious every song is fantastic.  You won't be disappointed!
B000002H97|5.0|Many of Metallica's 'fans' (and I use that term loosely) screamed 'sellout' at this album, mainly because it seemed to be their most commercial release, which it was and continues to be, but only because there were 5 singles from this album doesn't make it a bad album. It is actually one of their best.<br />And I can actually state that, since I have practically all of their albums, and I will stick by them as long as I can, refusing to call them sellouts, and I even enjoy St. Anger, so if you think that I will have a biased review about this album, then you can stop reading this right now.<br />The standout tracks for me would have to be Sad But True, The Unforgiven, Don't Tread On Me, Of Wolf And Man, The God That Failed, and the fastest track on here, The Struggle Within.<br />So, if you want to hear to some actual metal as opposed to the nu-metal junk that is infesting the airwaves these days, pick this up.
B00000DHRX|4.0|As far as Greatest Hits albums go this one is up there with Madonna's Immaculate Collection in how well it was pulled off.  Some of the songs do suffer slightly without the context of the albums they came from... however this is a great chance to own a lot of really great George Michael stuff, including some non-singles that were great despite their unpop-like flavor.  I recommend you instead buy the actual albums Older and Listen Without Prejudice Vol I only because some songs are better in the context and mood of the albums they came from.
B00008OWZC|5.0|This is the best live Zeppelin you will ever listen to.  They are at their peak and Page did an outstanding job putting the songs together.  This totally blows away The Song Remains the Same. It is amazing that this stuff was not released before now. I've had the CD for well over a month and can't stop listening to it.  If you are a Led Zeppelin fan, GET THIS CD!
B00008H2LB|4.0|Linkin Park's &quot;Meteora&quot; is an incredible album.  There isin't much on the CD but it is worth buying.  Here is my opinion on each track rating from 1-10:<br />1: Foreword: This track is very short.  It should have been in one of the songs on Meteora rather than the intro. [2]<br />2: Don't Stay: Good but not superb.  I think it could of inproved with the chorus, they are too smooth rather than jumpy in sound. [8]<br />3: Somewhere I Belong: This song has great samples in the track along with moving guitar sounds.  Chester was actually sick when he recorded the vocals in this song as the same with &quot;From The Inside.&quot; I wounder how he pulled that one off? [10]<br />4: Lying From You: The samples for this song are incredible but the singing and rapping could have been improved. [7]<br />5: Hit The Floor: &quot;Hit The Floor&quot; is the heaviest track on Meteora but yet it has rapping in the process. The flanger in the guitar and vocals make the song pretty interesting. [9]<br />6: Easier To Run: Similar to the hit single from &quot;Hybrid Theory,&quot; &quot;Crawling.&quot;  The vocals are smooth but very moving at the same time. [9]   <br />7: Faint: I don't get why so many people take interest in this song. It's the worst track on the album.  The samples for the song are really good. The rapping in the song was quite impressive too. It would have been superior if the chorus wasin't so poor. [5]<br />8: Figure.09: The guitar in this song are pretty good and so is the rapping.  The chorus could have been better though. [6]<br />9: Breaking The Habit: &quot;Breaking The Habit&quot; is very similar to &quot;My December,&quot; the best song Linkin Park has ever recorded that should have been on &quot;Hybrid Theory.&quot;  They took the same soft technique they used in that track that took Mike Shinoda &quot;6 Years&quot; to complete.  Very soft but very impressive. [9]<br />10: From The Inside:  The vocals in this song sound alot like &quot;Mudvaynes&quot; style in music.  The chorus is awsome to this track and is one of the best tracks on the album. [10]<br />11: Nobody's Listening: I'm not really into rap that much but this is one of the best songs on the album. This is one of the best rap songs they did.  Probably just as good as &quot;High Voltage&quot; from &quot;Hybrid Theory EP.&quot;  The Shakuhachi in this song is one of the most best sounding flutes I have ever heard and I hate flutes.  I like the Shakuhachi so much I put it in my comic, Moon Shadow®: Shakuhachi of Nature. [10]<br />12: Session: Great turntable art. Not as good as &quot;Technique&quot; though even though Technique is less than a minute. [9]<br />13: Numb:  The beginning samples sound like your in a forest.  I don't really like what there singing about but overall the song is impressive. [10]<br />The weakness of this album was the chouruses in some or even most of the songs.  If the chorus of the songs were improved, it would have been possibly better than Hybrid Theory.
B00005K3O4|4.0|Being afraid of clowns is a very common occurrence.  This movie gives new reasons to be afraid.  The entire idea of clowns is explored and twisted into a wonderful story of alien clowns invading a small town.<br />Balloons, popcorn, cotton candy, shadow puppets, pies in the face, and even the big top are all twisted into sinister ideals.  One character makes a statement wondering if the Ancient Astronaut idea could be applied and these aliens are the basis for our whole idea of clowns.<br />In a typical B-movie move, a pair of teens at a make-out location are the first to encounter the aliens.  They are not believed by the local police (one older officer who hates college kids and the other who dated one of the first witnesses).  But the truth soon comes out as the aliens step up their invasion.<br />The DVD has a clear picture and a couple of interesting deleted scenes (just leave the main menu on your screen for a few minutes and the Easter Egg menu will pop up), making of features, other short animated films and other stuff.  The one this I was disappointed about was it did not include the music video for the title song (available on one of the VHS editions).  The video has some further scenes of &quot;Big Top Burgers&quot; and the clown with the big hammer (and we get to see just what it does).<br />A wonderful film that is pretty seamless and follows its internal logic well.  Funny and creepy.  A real must-see.
0385493622|4.0|Number theory, even for someone such as myself who is a math student, has the allure of a night out with the obese grandmother with the seven ferrets who lives in the basement of my building.  The interestingly named Simon Singh, however, has done what I'd thought only a diety at the height of his powers could do, make the explanation of Fermat's Last Theorem into an entertaining and historical jaunt through the long history of the problem.<br />What I found most interesting, however, was the combination of luck and timing that, in addition to Wiles' dogged determination and extreme intellectual displine (he worked on it for 7 years, non-stop; I can't even floss regularly).  Wiles was, fortunately for him, at the right place and at the right time (am I the first one to write this?).  Without, for instance, Ken Ribet, Goro Shimura, and Yutaka Taniyama, Wiles would only be another pretty face in the mathematical community.<br />Great achievements, even if they have the practical equivalency of calcuating the height of beer foam, are almost always a slow step by step process.  Ironically, the process seems to be forgotten and only the achievement is remembered.
0440213525|5.0|This was a great book! I loved it.
B00005K3O4|5.0|Back in the stone age... 1989, to be exact...  I was in college. Two friends and I decided to take some strong acid and climb a mountain. Well, we did that, and it was an amazing experience, but nothing could prepare me for what happened upon our return back to the dorm (all wild-eyed, sweaty and grungy like a trio of psychotic wildmen).  <BR> <BR>A friend of mine had a VHS copy of &quot;Killer Klowns from Outer Space&quot;. He had just watched it, and decided that, in our state, we were definitely the target audience.<BR>So we settled in, mixed ourselves a cocktail, and pressed play...<br />WHOA!!!!<br />This movie rocked our worlds in ways that cannot even be expressed... Sure, the drugs helped, but the movie was already so uniquely out of its mind, that it hardly needed a psychotropic concierge. It already existed in a truly bizarre universe, with a hint of made-for-TV David Lynch, constantly straddling the line between absolute s**t and sublime parody. It was campy B-movie strangeness that alternated between generic 80's fodder (anyone who went through the 80's knows how formulaic and mind-numbing the films and TV were...) and freaky deaky, nightmarish imagery that played like a come-to-life Bruegel painting -- a rogues gallery of haggard, alien clowns<br />If you want a heapin' helping of a bizarre nightmare told through the lens of &quot;Who's the Boss?&quot;-style moviemaking, I recommend that you buy the DVD, drop a tab of acid, and just let go...
B000069HK2|5.0|I had never heard of The Used before their album appeared in my cafeteria cd player. After having listened to &quot;taste of ink&quot; i decided i really liked the band. I bought the cd and was totally stunned every song had a fairly unique sound(despite the screamed vocals)some songs have meaning to them while others are just great songs to jump to.<BR>Mabey Memories: 5/5 (great song, nice and hard,love the intro.)<BR>Taste Of Ink 5/5 (great single)<BR>Bulimic 4/5 (solid song)<BR>Say Days Ago 4.5/5(awesome hardcore beat)<BR>Poetic Tradgey 4/5 ( a meaningful song with edge)<BR>Buried Myself Alive 5/5 (great song, good lyrics)<BR>Box of sharp objects 5/5 (amazing track great screaming)<BR>Blue And Yellow 5/5 (a beautiful song, it has alot of depth)<BR>Greener With the scenery 4.5/5 (solid track)<BR>Noise and kisses 4/5 (another solid track)<BR>On My Own 3.5/5 (slow, gets better at the end, cds worst track)<BR>Peices Mended 5/5 (great end track, but if it were the end...)<BR>***Choke Me(secret track) 5/5 (awesome hardcore track)<br />If you dont own this cd GO GET IT...

0380002930|3.0|Watership Down, The Thoughts of a 7th Grader <br /> Watership down is a very different novel that any I have ever read. I like how Richard Adams added suspense and made you want to cheer for the rabbits at times like when they are escaping from Efrafa.  I will not lie, I thought that some parts of the book were very uneventful. When they left the very first warren I think that they should have taken some does with them. I thought that their journey was not my favorite part but I enjoyed trying to put the pieces together when they reached Cowslip's Warren. The most exciting part was when they were escaping with Bigwig from Efrafa and they went on the boat. It was suspenseful when Dandelion almost missed the boat. I also had fun reading about their trip to Nuthanger farm. I was very surprised that they beat the cat. Another one of the best parts was when they had the fight when the rabbits from Efrafa came to take the does, Blackavaar, and bigwig. I also liked the part when they first discovered Watership down. <br /> My overall impression of the book is that it was a pretty ok book but I think adults would enjoy it more than kids would. It's like an acquired taste. Some like it and some don't. I would recommend this book to people who don't mind reading a little while until they get into it. For people who want action from the start I strongly do not recommend this book to you. I thought that I didn't understand the book as well as I do after writing about it. It was an interesting novel.
0385504209|4.0|I had a friend tell me that this was the best novel he had ever read. I found that a bit of an exaggeration, but it's certainly a very good, hard-to-put-down, read. It's a remarkably well-written combination of puzzles, mystery, history, and chase that will keep you up late at night.
0930289528|5.0|An amazingly daring, innovative, provocative work of art! Enough said. Ignore the right-wingers (can I say Neo-Nazis?), this is an extremely enjoyable read. They just hate it because the villains remind them of themselves too much:)
B00005JMD3|4.0|If you like an Action Adventure flick, you should enjoy this one. It's all about a hand picked Swat team in action and there isn't a dull moment from beginning to end. Samuel L. Jackson seemed a perfect fit for the roll of the seasoned Swat team leader and there was never any doubt as to who was calling the shots.
B00003CXCK|5.0|Wow.  Just wow.  That's all.  Gripping, moving, tear jerking, uplifting, top notch acting, stunning photography, script line in synch with the book, true life ending, OMG.  This is the story of Oskar Schindler who kept over 1,000 people alive during the Nazi reign.  This is a movie (and book) you must watch (or read) to believe.  I generally do not care for \\"war\\" movies, and although I love splatter films and gory fiction books, I despise real life violence.  Having once been a victim of violent crime, I have a relationship with real life horror that I do not like to explore, but the heroism of this story so dramatically overwhelms the real horrors that it is a must see for anyone.  Liam Neeson is phenomenal in his role as Schindler, and Ben Kingsley along with Ralph Finnes fills out the superb acting.  Difficult to watch, impossible to forget, it is truly the story of heroism on its grandest scale.<br />The most poignant moment is the one, the only, faded splash of faint color in the little girls red coat; the rest of the movie is black and white, which only adds to the impact of the total emotion of this fantastic film.
B00006CXXU|4.0|After seeing Christina's style of singing when she first debut with \\"Geenie in a bottle\\" everyone thought she was just another fad. She had the blond hair and innocent look, which has really changed in her second album. The album is filled with one of the greatest pop vocal performances I have seen since the beginning of Mariah Carrey's career. Because she's topless on the cover and the title of the album is \\"stripped\\" those who haven't given christina a chance are not going to be attracted to buy the album. In this album she shows that she is one of the most vocally talented artists today. If she would just stray from the dirty image and let people aknowledge her through her voice she will be more respected.

B00009XITP|4.0|I haven't even heard of this movie, and neither have I even kept up with Amanda Bynes' career, but I bought this DVD on a whim and it is pretty cool. Last time I remember Amanda was portraying &quot;Dear Ashley&quot; in the &quot;All That&quot; show back in 1997. She was still a little kid in there, I think she was 11. I also remember Allen Iverson was a rookie then with only one tattoo. Now it's 2K3 and Amanda is all matured and lookin' nice, and Iverson got a million tatts, and of course, is one of the top stars in the NBA. The point is, it's been six years!! Amanda has grown, y'all. This movie is really cool, I liked the scenes in the flea market or wherever they were in. I highly recommend this movie. I give it 4 stars because it's kind of a strange story.
B000002LND|4.0|This is 1980s/early 1990s Madonna at her best.  You can hear the transition from dance pop princess to more mature woman.
0375414053|5.0|Allison Pearson's first novel is FANTASTIC.  You won't be able to put it down.  I think it's one of the best books I've ever read, and I'm a fairly tough critic (although, in fairness, I probably just don't review the stuff I think is lousy).  She captures the madness of working motherhood and marriage, and is a very very funny writer, with a great ear for dialogue and eye for scene.  There's one episode in the book, where Kate is reading something, that will move you to tears, I'm sure, so have the Kleenex handy, but otherwise, be prepared to laugh and nod a lot.  Enjoy!
B00007ELEL|5.0|This movie is amazing, I recomend it for everyone, Jeff Bridges does a great job in it and it is AWESOME, if you don't already have this movie then order it right now!!!, I've watched it so many times.  GREAT MOVIE!!!!!!!
B00009XITP|5.0|Ok, I watched this movie because I wanted to see a nice, clean family movie.  And that is EXACTLY what I got!  I really liked it a lot.  The last \\"cute\\" family movie that I saw like this was \\"The Parent Trap\\" with Dennis Quaid (another recommended film for viewers looking for nice family flicks).  <br />And BTW . . . some people should really stop being nit-picky when they see these types of films (*cough* look at person from Singapore's review *cough*).  This film was really made for pure entertainment purposes . . . to sit back for a while and smile or laugh.  But NOT to criticize the bad acting, taboos, or political incorrectness of every little scene in the film.  That's really ridiculous!  We're not judging a potential film for an Oscar, you know.  :P<br />In fact, there should be more movies made like this in Hollywood.  And by that, I mean CLEAN and SMUT-less.  Most films these days are really tacky . . . . like out of Sodom and Gommorah or something.
0679731725|5.0|ishiguro, with this novel, clearly proves he is master of tone and subtlety. its hard to believe this novel was not written by an english 'gentleman'. the strength of this brilliant and moving novel is its ability to unravel the various facets of the 3 lead characters, the narrator Mr. Stevens, Lord Darlington and the Housekeeper Miss Kenton, through subtle intones about their moods and behavior and morality and feelings without ever for an instance saying anything blatantly.<br />this is a work of a true master, through a light hearted and dextruosly woven word play he evokes the feel and sense of a time and place, enabling us to study three powerful and interesting characters. a definite must read for all discerning lovers of the novel.
B00008S2VG|5.0|I love the sound Madonna has gone with this time around...all the tracks are great &amp; I love them. There are some of the songs that in my opinion are the best because of the lyrics. &quot;Nothing Fails&quot; was written for me...HOW did she get in my head like that?! &quot;X-Static Process&quot; is just beautiful, the only word I know to describe it. Yet another song that I can relate to mind body and soul. The best songs due to perfect production are the singles &quot;American Life&quot; (great lyrics, makes me wanna dance) &amp; &quot;Hollywood&quot; (gets you to know Madonna a little bit better). Other great dance tracks that still have great lyrics are &quot;Mother and Father&quot;, &quot;I'm So Stupid&quot;, &quot;Nobody Knows Me&quot; &amp; the hit &quot;Die Another Day&quot;. I can also deeply relate to &quot;Nobody Knows Me&quot;, I feel like she's describing me. I like listening to this album when I'm driving in the car &amp; just thinking or when I'm laying down at night. It's really comforting &amp; relaxing &amp; I think everyone can relate to something about this album if not everything. Madonna sure is talented &amp; I hope she doesn't stop making albums like this...this is one of her best. It's highly underrated. I reccomend it. :)
B00004XONN|4.0|another great album by a band who has no one left to impress.  as they grow, they seem to mature greatly as a band and as songwriters.  kid a is just another great example of that.  give it a listen or 10, because it takes quite a while to grow on you.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|...which is exactly why a lot of people supposedly did not like the movie. Lets get the obvious out of the way: Reloaded was a hugely anticipated movie with enough hype surrounding it to cover the universe. It was the sequel to one of the most popular sci-fi/action movies in history, and probably one of the best. You can't help the fact that many people are going to walk away from the theatre either confused as hell, very angry or very happy. The Matrix Reloaded is not perfect, but I consider it equally as good as the first. It even surpasses it in a lot of ways, and in some it doesn't come close. But make no mistake... Reloaded is for the chosen.<br />The plot here is deeper then the grand canyon. For some, it may be considered a mess. But this is far from the truth, and is  simply the result of a lack of understanding the films very complex plot. For the deep thinkers out there, who can really take the plot in and spring up theory after theory about whats going to happen next, those are the people who are really going to love this movie; like me. <br />Casual movie-goers will like the movie for it's amazing action sequences and special effects, which easily set the new standad in movies. Hardcore Matrix fans will either love this movie to death and spend countless hours discussing the movies plot with there friends until part three is released, or they will hate it because they could not get over the first movie. Reloaded really deepens the plot... so much so that many will just walk away boggled. <br />The movie does have it's flaws. One example would be Keanue Reevers (Neo). His acting, as usual, isn't exactly... impressive, but he is what he is and you can probably deal with that. Another problem is that there is a bit less of a 'feeling of danger' with the main characters while they are in the Matrix. In the first movie, you really felt like they were being hunted every minute by Agents. In Reloaded, it more or less feels like they are just doing whatever thehell they want. But considering Neo is the One now, and he can kick anyones [butt], you can't really help that. The last problem I had was that Morpheus is just too much different in this movie than the first. He just felt more human in the last film. <br />The Matrix Reloaded is an amazing movie that deserves much credit for it's insanely impressive special effects, camera work and action scenes. No other action movie can match what's here. And as for the plot, you will most likely love it if you can understand it and just accept it.
0385720920|3.0|Pahlaniuk's fight club will always be the standard by which all his other books will be rated and sadly choke does nmot quite stand up to the thril and vivacity of his earlier novel. while ever since i read the opening lines i had always wanted to lay my hands on this one, i was disappointed that the rest of the book does not live up to its initial promise.<br />surely the book has its moments. in turns poignant, funny, tender and outrageous. this story of a sex addict and his weird relationship with his mother and the conviction of his own base nature are all woven interestingly to make this satire but sadly it lacks the bite and sting that fight club had.<br />the novel at times tends to be boring and leans towards the weird for the sake of weird. oh! and the end. suffice it to say that fight club is fight club and choke will always be a wanna-be.
B00006FDCD|4.0|I actually dont  enjoy reading King's novels and have watched many of his movies, without appreciating them, so when this movie came out I  figured what another waste of  tape. Sure there was bigname actors in it, but so what???<br />  This one surprised me!! It scared me, it thrilled me, the story of the  interaction between the kids and the adults was absolute genius.<br /> The acting was superb, and believable. A great thrilling movie!!!
B00005B36H|5.0|This album is a Masterpiece! You can tell that Maynard has done it again making an amazing album, by far better than all his others. Definetly not an album too be soon forgotten but a classic. Lateralus is an album that is enticed with complex rhythm changes and haunting vocals that stay with you for days on end. The theme of this album is to not take things for as you see them rather question them. Here is a rundown of the songs:<br />The Grudge: Good opener with just as good guitar riffs, ok lyrically<br />Eon Blue Apocalypse: short little track with a great guitar piece<br />The Patient: a song that starts off slow but then kicks in a couple minutes in, gets better at the end<br />Mantra: eerie sounds like something a dying whale would make<br />Schism: one of the radio hits, good song a little over played but still a classic with great lyrics<br />Parabol: first part of the song the parabola song, starts off slow with GREAT lyrics this baby will stick with you, when combined with Parabola it creates an amazing sound<br />Parabola: the heavier part of the song with great riffs, vocals and over all sound, My favorite song on the album<br />Ticks and Leeches: a heavier song, not one of my favorites i usually skip it but it's an ok song if you give it a chance<br />Lateralus: Great lyrics ,great guitar, and a more of an upbeat song<br />Dispostion: a slow one with a hypnotizing guitar and what sounds like bongos, a real relaxing type song<br />Reflection: a song with a lot of the synthesizer and a melo tone<br />Triad: the heaviest song on the album, its a good one to listen to when u want to get pumped<br />Faaip de Oaid: A creepy track with a drum solo over this phone call that was lifted from a guy who called a talk show to talk about the secrets behind area 51, when this call was made most of the satellites lost there signals in space, creepy stuff
0783229372|5.0|This has always been one of my all-time favorite films.  Yes, I am aware of some liberities taken with the facts surrounding the Hindenburg's last flight (the tear in the skin of the ship's fin, for example - that actually happened to the Graf Zeppelin some years before, not the Hindenburg.)  Then again, this film is historical fiction, and should be enjoyed as such.  In addition, the Hindenburg flight sequences are stunning, as is the attention to detail throughout the production.  A must see!
0142004235|3.0|I am only 1/4 through the book and have already noticed a very obvious misspelling and periods where there should be commas, etc.  I think the editor should've done a little more homework.  I know it shouldn't bother me, but it does. Call me crazy......
B00006JDVV|3.0|I loved the dragon special effects. They were awesomely realistic. The story line  wasnt  that good. Acting was adequate, but not great. Some times I thought the  entire thing cointrived, but if you like  dragon ergo dinosaurian effects, this might do for you.<br />  I wouldnt buy it again. [ Rental much less disappointing!]

I call this my \\"happy music,\\" as it goes straight to the heart and expresses a joy unheard of in any other type of music. After watching the movie, I went out immediately to purchase the cd. The movie and the cd launched a new career for the artists. Ibrahim Ferrer, an exceptional musician, had given up on his music career in Cuba, as he could not get a job. During the filming of this movie, the artists played for a packed house at Carnegie Hall. After singing a solo, Ibrahim Ferrer was stunned as the crowd gave him a standing ovation. The look on his face was one of disbelief and humble surprise. The audience loved him. His career took off and he has gone on to record two other cd's (that I am aware of). I cannot recommend his music enough. If nothing else, please rent, borrow, or steal this movie, as it will be well worth your while to watch. It's an experience!
B00005JM4Z|1.0|You know, I have no idea who on earth gave this lame turkey of a movie the green light to being made.<br />Sure, I'll go for some brainless adrenaline-drenched fun from time to time but unfortunately, even when I'm in a \\"I just want to have fun\\" mood, \\"2 Fast 2 Furious\\" fails in just about everyway it could. In fact, it FAILS COMPLETELY!<br />Lots of the negative elements that dogged down the first one were mostly balanced out by excellent visual effects and enjoyable, if not realistic actions scenes and resulted in a movie that was fun but stupid all at the same time. Sadly, I cannot say the same thing aobut the sequel. This movie is just DUMB, without being fun.<br />Whatever went wrong with this, really went wrong. What really disgusts me in this movie, as well as the first one is that it totally reduces the woman down to just mere 'objects'! The girls in this one are FAR, FAR worse than those from the first one. I don't mean to sound like I'm a shallow, superficial punk but THEY ARE TOTALLY HIDEOUS AND SICKENING TO LOOK AT!! Blech! I in no way am implying that sexuality is evil. Quite the contrary, sexuality is beautiful but it makes me sick to see how they portray girls as mere 'objects' in movies like this. At least 95 percent of casual girls I see in my neighborhood, look FAR more attractive than alot of the characters in this movie. I might be taking heat for bashing them but I totally stand by my verdict. When it comes to a good female character in a movie, I'd rather take class and intelligence anyday over mere bare skin! None of the female characters looked attractive at all. That one character (I forget her name) looks more like an alien from outer space! She's HIDEOUS!!! I don't mean to sound like a superficial person but holy mother of God, they are just repulsive to a maximum degree!<br />The souped-up cars may be cool to watch but this is just a rehashed version of the first F&F movie, without the fun of that one. In fact, \\"2 Fast\\" felt more like a bad 2 hour long NASCAR commercial with excessive amounts of MGM Grand colors thrown in.<br />Maybe I'm just growing up, maybe I'm getting too old for this dragracing stuff but \\"2 Fast 2 FUrious\\" is just a complete pile of cinematic manure. This garbage is primarily aimed at lowlifes who know nothing more than to throw tantrums because his/her parents can't afford to buy him/her a brand spanking new car!<br />But hey, I might have bashed this movie to pieces with this review but even then, I'm against censorship so don't let me stop you from seeing this. I just wanted to let you know that there are MUCH better movies out there that deliver lots more than this turkey. Go see \\"Terminator 3: Rise of The Machines\\" instead as it has FAR superior action. Or dive into the first and third \\"Indiana Jones\\" movies instead. Believe me, the cars may have been really old-fashioned but the car chase scenes in these two movies are FAR more intelligent and truckloads more fun than these sportcar races. If you want to see a bunch of sportcar races, go watch a NASCAR race or better yet, attend a NASCAR racing event like the Indianapolis 500. At least the adrenaline is right in front of you.<br />Hollywood owes us an apology for this mess.a bad 2 hour long NASCAR commercial with excessive amounts of MGM Grand colors thrown in. <br />Maybe I'm just growing up, maybe I'm getting too old for this dragracing stuff but \\"2 Fast 2 FUrious\\" is just a complete pile of cinematic manure.

B000099T2L|4.0|I think &quot;Dangerously in love&quot; is a pretty good album. All though i do prefer Kelly Rowland's album better, Beyonce still has a great album<br />It will definetly take you a while to get into Beyonce's album, thats what happend for me. At first i wasnt really feeling the album, but now i definetly am vibeing with the album.<br />The vocals, lyrics, and beats are all on point!<br />Too me the stand-out best tracks are..<br />Crazy in love<BR>Naughty Girl<BR>Baby Boy<BR>Be with you<BR>Signs (Best song in the album, hopefully will be a single)<BR>Speechless<BR>Dangerously in Love 2<br />The only reason i take away 1 star because, i feel there are some filler's on the album.<br />But overall this album is great! Go get it if you dont own it!
B00003CXXM|4.0|Wish you could give a half a star! It was a great action movie, that I could actually watch again and again.I wasnt crazy over the love story part of the movie, but it was  bearable! LOL<br />  Buy this one, it deserves a spot in your library of dvd's!
B000092Q4U|5.0|Finally, a metal album that is brutal enough to share my Hardcore playlists.  This album is simply incredible.  Unlike other new metal bands ShadowsFall and Chimaira, LOG keeps the retro-metal guitar solos to a minimum and concentrates on brutality.  Plenty of syncopated double bass/guitar riffs along with the killer vocals and some breakdowns that are simply unrivaled so far in the rebirth of metal.  I'm not ready to say it's the best metal album ever but I'm really close.
0553382179|5.0|This is a wonderful book.  It helps you get off you franny and do something.  That way you can love yourself and your family.  I know that someone wrote something nasty about this book.  If she doesn't like it she can send it back and get her money back.  As for the comments she made, nasty, illiterate people should be helped.  Maybe the next book will be how to go back to school to learn to read and comprehend!
B000092ZYX|5.0|In the sludge that today's popular music is, it is simply fantastic to have Hail to the Thief come out. After listening to the cd about 3 times a day for the first week i got it, i must say it takes a little while to grow. Is it worth the time? My God YES. Ever aspect of this cd is top of the line. Radiohead is the future of music. Say goodbye to the typical. <BR>First of all, the music on this cd is crafted to perfection. If listened to carefully and intelligently, one will notice that at any given time, there is a orgasmic polyphony of sound. The chord progressions and phrasing is amazingly unique and unusual at times but the result is beautiful. The swells and builds and moods the music creates brings the album up to a level matched only by Thom Yorke's lyrics and singing. <BR>Finally, there is someone with something important to say again. Not only do the lyrics sting and bite at times, they caress and sooth at others, and haunt still at others (time has proven Radiohead to be the kings of haunting.)<BR>This is radioheads most solid, unique, inspiring, and best album to date. This blows OK Computer out of the water, and if you dont think that is true, you havent listened to Thief enough. After listening to it an immeasurable amount of times, i am still finding little sounds or parts i hadn't heard before. If one REALLY listens, it is clear that these guys are the top of the game. A Diamond.
B00009UW0N|4.0|Still more of treat than a trick!<br />It didn't bother me the EXTENDED version was not included in this latest in a long line of Halloween releases.  That version is still available separately, and only had 10 minutes of scenes that were added in to pad the running time of the movie for its network debut.  John Carpenter himself has disowned that cut, and the scenes add little to the movie except to tie it in better with HALLOWEEN 2 which included the &quot;I'm your sister!&quot; plot twist.<br />The film transfer does look a little brighter here.  Dean Cundy would prefer you have the other release I am sure, but most people won't notice except for film buffs.  We're talking slight degrees here!  In some scenes it helps you see more of the action, and its still the ultimate thrill ride.  The sound is still a great mix that utilizes every speaker in the room!<br />The new 87 minute documentary is a little bit of a let down, but not much.  My biggest beef is they use clips from the movie to pad out the time.  I don't need to see the movie again in a documentary, and most of the Jamie Lee interviews were seen in the last HALLOWEEN UNMASKED docu found on the last disc.  Nobody seems to have much new to say, but it is a little more fleshed out with wonderful shots of a working Donald Pleasance.<br />The real star here is that long lost commentary featuring John Carpenter, Debra Hill, and Jamie Lee herself.  Wonderful stuff!  It may be several years old, but just to hear the main players talk about their creation is worth it.  Surprisingly Debra Hill seems to have the most to say though.<br />You get a visit to the locations with Debra Hill and PJ Soles, and the usual overkill of radio spots and trailer after trailer of &quot;THE ONE THE ONLY! HALLOWEEN!&quot;  How many ways can they cut that thing?<br />Overall it's a nice set to have.  Halloween completists will rejoice to have the commentary, while film students will probably want to seek out the earlier release with better color correction.  And then others who remember the tv broadcasts will want that extended version.  Me?  I own all three!  HALLOWEEN for every mood!elease with better color correction.  And then others who remember the tv broadcasts will want that extended version.  Me?  I own all three!  HALLOWEEN for every mood!
B00000JPH4|4.0|This is a great movie. I love the characters. There are alot of values being addressed here such as the love for your planet, respect to elders and animals and each other.
B00005JMFR|5.0|First of let me say matrix and matrix reloaded are two of the best movies i have ever seen. I hear all this talk of a matrix <BR>in side a matrix mabye but i think it will be something alittle more eazy to grasp take this for one. Neo and trinity did have sex in reloaded mabye neo will distroy the matrix and die in the process sacrificing his self but in the process leave his son to fight the physical war agenst the machines. Are mabye what if the machines there self are trapped in there own matrix controled by a higher power. And one other thing if the rescue<BR>ship that came to there aide used emp to save there lives wouldent it have disabled it mabye it was Neo are mabye it was smith wanting to kill neo and claim the glory for himself.
B00003CXBK|5.0|I just saw this movie, and I have been left speechless.  What an amazing work of art.
B00003CX8U|5.0|Most people think of choreographers, and they think of mincing gay men who stage bright lavish numbers with Easter bonnets and bouncing ballerinas.  ALL THAT JAZZ gives you a sleazey, chain-smoking, woman-chasing alcoholic who choreographs dark and dirty numbers where people strip and writhe on the floor!  AH!  The genius of Fossee - expect the unexpected.<br />This movie is the disturbing allegorical and autobiographical take of Fossee on the subject he knows best - HIMSELF!  It typifies the best of 70s cinema with its take no prisoners honesty.  Forget FAME or CENTERSTAGE, this is the real deal of what it's like in showbiz.  AMERICAN IDOL be damned, here is a gritty and real backstage story that shows you the good and the bad of a life lived onstage.<br />Glad to see some extras here!  Roy Scheider gives scene-specific commentary, and you get some FOSSEE numbers to boot.  But the nicest thing will be seeing this in widescreen - something I have not been able to do since it came out in theatres!<br />If you like CHICAGO or MOULIN ROUGE, this one's just as good.  Perfect match for it would be CABARET.  The brilliance of Fossee here is on display full force - humans with flaws who move with such grace and style you forgive them!  And that's the real jazz here.
B00000JPH5|4.0|This is a great movie, very imaginative. You can watch it several times and learn/see something new each time.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Where did this guy come from? In an age where the radio is saturated with quirky pop and mindless boy bands, John Mayer has come to save the day. This album may be the best I have heard in years and no matter how much I listen, I can't get enough. From the first song to the last, it carries you along and you don't want to get off. First time I heard of this guy was on VH-1 about a year ago. I thought: \\"yeah, yeah, another Dave Matthews wannabe.\\" I could not have been more wrong. As far as I am concerned Dave Matthews is the living legend of modern musicians. I'm 24, and I can pretty much assure you that my kids will be bouncing to \\"Ants Marching\\" and \\"Too Much\\" some day. So as difficult as this may be for me to admit, John Mayer may be hot on Dave's heels. His guitar is very similar and although his voice is not as hypnotic and powerful as Dave's is, he is a better vocalist. Want proof, see him live. It's rare that musicians now days are as good live as they are on the album (Again, DMB is an exception - they're better live.) Well John Mayer is no different. He's the real deal on disk and in person. I rarely suggest anyone buys a CD unless it's really worth they're while. Well with this one you get your money's worth and then some. Just watch, this guy is going to blow up in the next couple years. He's the real deal!!!!
B000006045|4.0|This album starts out with great direction, but loses it about halfway through.  I still can't tell you the names of the later tracks, much less figure out which one we're listening to.  Having said that, it's still great to have playing in the background.  Also, the first half of the disc really is excellent.  The tiny beginning of &quot;Angel&quot; exploding into a near anthemic sound is very very cool.  &quot;Risingson&quot; is one of the best electronic songs out there, and may be worth the price of the album for some.  All in all, I'd recommend this album for anyone interested in starting to listen to Massive Attack.
B00000IREA|5.0|You want classic Sci Fi with visionary special effects and mind-bending themes?  Check out STAR WARS or 2001!  You want a zero gravity striptease, costumes that fall off at a moment's notice, and a space craft with wall to wall shag carpeting traveling through a lava lamp?  BARBARELLA fits the bill!  This is the widescreen DVD version with no edits.  Although I have heard rumors of a more racy cut somewhere out there, this is not the PG rerelease from the 70s.  See the movie Jane Fonda wants you to forget!  Too bad because she's sexy, funny, and beautiful here.  Groove to the soundtrack of Phil Spector rip-offs, watch in awe as she seduces ... well... everyone in the film (incuding a female tyrant with a horn!).  But still, it's pretty tame and innocent fun.  I watch this when I want to be in a good mood.  It's silly, fluffy fun!  A pink bunny if you will.
0316666343|5.0|What wonderful writing talent. <BR>I am very involved in the spiritual aspects of life <BR>and find this book to be very similar to my belief of <BR>what Heaven...proper...must truly be like.<br />The book is an easy read.<BR>Alice creates such a normalcy to each of the characters.<BR>The descriptions and dialogue is believable. <br />You can imagine being her father who has defined the killer and now just needs proof. You can understand the obsession Dad feels. <br />You can totally understand Mom's conflict in connecting to closely with those in law enforcement as her last hope and only possible connection to her daughter. <br />I tend to like reads about After Life, Spiritual topics, all of the subjects that make you think outside the lines. <BR>Even though this is fiction...it certaintly falls inside of the same perimeters of the other books I read.<br />And I think, has more truth to descriptions than imagined. <br />We can only hope. <BR>A great book.<BR>And I would love to know more about the author...<br />Alice Sebold.

0385509456|4.0|It has been a long time since a narrator has intrigued me as much as Christopher Boone, a fifteen year-old autistic child.  Despite his limited range of emotion and incomprehension of metaphors, his story did not leave me out in the cold nor did it stop me from finding a point of indentification.<BR>My only disappointment with the book was a quick and pat resolution to book's main plot point...  This did not, however, arrest my enjoyment of seeing the world through the eyes of someone who's mind is so different from my own.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This movie is a must-have.  It's that simple.  The story is layered, and very open to interpretation, so I'll amend my former statement by saying this: if you want everything to be resolved and clear-cut, perhaps this isn't a movie to impulse buy, but you should still check it out.  The plot is ambiguous, but where the movie really shines is character development.  You will know each of the characters by the end of the film, even the character whose only words are 'Chut up!'  It's a very emotional film, touching on feelings of loneliness, love, compassion, and others.  Slow-moving at times without dragging, and humor is present (plentiful, if you look hard enough) without being juvenile or infringing on the film's integrity.  Really a must-have or at the very least a must-see-twice film.
B00005N919|5.0|Forget the rated version of BASIC INSTINCT.  It's white-washed and missing graphic scenes of sex and violence that make the movie what it is.  Sharon Stone plays the devil ... yes, Paul Verhoven admits that she is the the devil incarnate as a blonde ice-pick weilding bisexual psychotic who tempts and outsmarts every single person in the cast!  Priceless here in DVD land is Camille Paglia's radical feminist take on the movie.  She's fast and funny describing BASIC INSTINCT as a movie where women take back their sexual power!  Come inside and check out the steamiest erotic thriller ever!  Political correctness means it could never be made today.  Trashy, yes!  But also very well done and stylish.  Sharon Stone became a star, and Michael Douglas never quite recovered.  See why!
0792151712|1.0|\\"The Unsinkable\\"<br /> Titanic is an epic drama that is untouchable in comparison, winning 11 Academy Awards including Best Picture.  Paramount Pictures and Twentieth Century Fox joined James Cameron to bring the 1997 film running for 194 minutes to anxious viewers.  Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet take the starring roles as Jack and Rose.<br /> Rose had no idea when she boarded the \\"unsinkable\\" R.M.S. Titanic for it's maiden voyage what was in store.  Titanic was a luxury ocean liner like no one had ever seen before, it was bigger, faster, and fancier than any ship of it's time.  When Rose set sail with her mother and wealthy fiancé, she did not expect to find her true love.  Jack (DiCaprio) was a misfit who had won his third class ticket in a lucky hand at poker just minutes before the ship sets sail.  Jack catches Roses attention and she can't help but keep seeing him against her fiancé's orders.  Rose finds true love with this scoundrel, as the rest of her \\"society friends\\" view him.<br /> Jack and Roses love is pushed to limit as Titanic hits an iceberg and the invincible ship begins to go down.  As the ship begins to sink Rose and Jack must choose between their love and life.  Fifteen hundred people go into the cold Atlantic ocean and only six will survive leaving those six and the lucky ones who made in into a life boat to by haunted by that cold night at sea.<br /> The award-winning soundtrack ( Best Original Song) adds to the drama.  This film shows us how a handful of people and a couple bad decisions can end the lives of so many.  I like this movie for the fact it has what seems like such a depressing outcome but at the same time, you want to watch it again and again to see the wonderful love story.  I give film 5 stars.
B00005JKZV|2.0|I didn't buy this DVD, the review is based on the theater movie.<BR>I have to say this movie disappointed me. The first movie TFOTR is really good, but this one is too long and many parts should be simply cut out.<BR>The fact I don't like it is not because I am a book purist, but making Aragon fall over a cliff is over the top, why don't just cut it and save me some time? You know he won't die or there won't be the 3rd movie, and he simply rode back without any adventure, just let him day dreaming would be more acceptable. And I can't understand why the camera shifted back and forth and swirled around so much which made me dizzy, and often the scenes were not that scenic. The women characters were so pale, the only purpose for Arwen's role in this movie seems is just to show Lev Taylor's face, and Eowyen couldn't stir any affection. The part Pippin and Merry tricked Treebeard was so outragously stupid it's an insult.<BR>The part I liked was the Ents attacking Isengard but it's too short, the fight in Helm's deep was too long but eye and ear satifiying, though not the brain, Gollum saved the movie from a total disater.
B00004YX39|5.0|Steely Dan's 1980 album, \\"Gaucho\\" would have to be one of the best albums ever recorded, and not to mention, one of the best-engineered albums ever.<BR> <BR>For Some, Gaucho was a terrible dissapointment. It didn't seem as good as Aja, and it looked like the last SD album ever. But from Babylon Sisters to Third World Man, Gaucho is an astonishing piece of work. <br />Everything on this album is great - The Musicians, the arrangements, the production (the production is untouchable!), and not to forget, the music!<br />This \\"digitally remastered\\" edition of Gaucho is great. Not only because of the great sound quality, but because of the liner notes by Donald Fagen & Walter Becker. The notes are always great.<br />Gaucho is one Of the best albums ever!<br />5/5
0688163173|5.0|I'll be brief: a good read to lay down with before you go to bed.  You'll forget about your day and enjoy what comes next.  Pick it up - I don't even like mystery novels and couldnt put this down.
B000002UD7|5.0|Actually is a wonderful record. A true example of art from the cover to the music. Today, it is still one of my most favorite records from PSB.
B000069CWE|1.0|This CD was a disappointment. I'm not a huge Linkin Park fan, no, but I did like Hybrid Theory and a few songs off of Meteora.<br />To make a CD composed almost entirely of remixes is a very risky thing to do. Remixes are either a good addition to the original song, or they completely butcher the original song and may even deter people from enjoying that said first song. So, basically, people either love them, hate them, or just think they're \\"okay.\\" <br />In this case, the latter was true. Linkin Park is \\"rap-rock\\" type of music, but the \\"rap\\" part of it is more often than not, harder to hear on their earlier release and their later release. On this CD, the \\"rap\\" part of it showed through more clearly than on Hybrid Theory, and it was a butchery of the whole CD. Having rappers on good songs was just a mockery. Some people appreciate rap (I am not among those that embrace all rap; I have a select few rap songs and artists that I like, and perhaps this makes my review biased, but, for those like-minded as I am [that find most rap to be both unappealing and boring] I am trying to be honest.) and that's fine; if you like rap-rock and are willing to embrace the \\"rap\\" part tacked onto songs, then yes, you will like this CD. If you do not like rap, and find it often repulsive, then chances are, you won't like this CD much.<br />CD gets one star for \\"Krwling.\\"
0060926317|3.0|When I picked this book in a bookstore in Alice Springs, I was not aware that the author was going to be unclear about whether this was fact or fiction. The cover describes the book as \\"A Woman's Journey into Dreamtime Australia.\\" I was ready for another account of a journey in the Australian outback and insights into various aboriginal groups. Being halfway through \\"Tracks\\" - a factual account of an Australian woman's journey across the outback (which I have also reviewed)- I was hoping this book purporting to present a somewhat similar experience by an American woman would be equally enjoyable. <br />In her introduction, the author allows the reader to judge whether the book is fact or fiction, suggesting it can be enjoyed both ways. Certainly, if you are willing to suspend disbelief, and read it as pure fiction, it is a good read, even though it falls short of the quality of similar books by Carlos Castenda relating to native Americans. <br />But, on finishing the book, I was left with an uncomfortable sense that the author's ambivalence over fact and fiction might actually be manipulative. What bothered me even more was that she might also be manipulating the very people she purports to promote in the book. <br />You should be aware that this book is very controversial, and even among many Australian aborigines who feel that they have been exploited by it.I would strongly suggest you first consult some articles about how it has been received by Australians - aboriginal and non-aboriginal.
B00006AFUR|5.0|Wow...someone who can act and sing WELL. This guy has to be my favorite entertainer, considering I loved him in Requiem for a Dream (one of my fav movies ever), and now he leads a band that has truly captured my imagination...something that rarely happens. My brother had borrowed it from a friend almost a year or so ago and I'd never heard of them...and being a big fan of Orgy and the like, I listened to 30 Secs to Mars and was blown away. I instantly loved \\"Capricorn\\", and from there the CD only gets better. Amazing.<br />There is no filler on this album, each and ever song here was crafted beautifully, and you have to respect that. If you're a 30 Seconds to Mars fan, you're going to hear people complaining about how bad they [are] live and that the songs are too repetitive. Both fair arguments, but no band is perfect. So what if Leto makes a few mistakes vocally in their live shows...it's LIVE, and things are gonna go wrong here and there. You have to look at the overall quality of this band, and what they're trying to achieve. This cd is so original and so far away from the norm. This is their first effort, and if they can simply maintain the excellence achieved here, then I can't wait for their future works. You aren't going to see this on TRL, top 20 countdown, or even mtv2 for that matter (I've never seen them on there anyway). So go get this immediately and prepare for pure sonic bliss.
0684833395|5.0|Simply put, Catch 22 remains entirely original and absurdly different 40 years after its first publication.  It's 1984 with wit and satire.  You'll laugh 'til it hurts and maybe even think a bit too.   Buy it and let Joseph Heller surprise you with his weird and wonderful way of writing.
B00009V7P8|5.0|Searching for words to describe this album are like trying to count the stars in the sky. (I know it's cliche, but it works).  This album is amazingly beautiful.  <br />Back in May I picked up a friend of mine in Chicago after she spent the semester in Ireland and the whole way home (a 3+ hour drive) all we listened to was O.  After we arrived home, I decided I had to have the album.  I ordered the import off amazon and before it arrived, I got to see Damien back in Chicago at Schubas.  If the album itself doesn't amaze you, go see him live and you'll fall in love.  Just a few more weeks until he plays Chicago again.<br />This album ranges from soft ballads (The Blower's Daughter) to heart-wrenching rock (the second half of I Remember).  Unlike many albums from folk singers, I think this one is best listened through all the way at once.  While there are great standout tracks (Amie, I Remember, Delicate), the whole album tells a story.  There is a gradual almost epic-like progression throughout that sends the listener on a roller-coaster of emotions.<br />One of the greatest things about this album is the fact that Damien recorded this (mostly) in his basement over the course of a year.  Instead of being thrown into a studio for a month to record the album using manufactured emotion (having to record on days you don't feel like it), Damien recorded each of the songs when he was \\"feeling it\\".  That's why all of the emotion in these songs are SO real, so genuine.  There is nothing manufactured about its sound.  Another magnificant thing about it is the range of instrumentation and musical genre used.  As I said, there are the slow, soft ballads, and rocking songs as well as Operatic elements (Eskimo)and beautiful orchestration in \\"Amie\\" and \\"Cold Water\\".<br />From listening to the album and several live shows I have, I can tell that Damien does not have a powerful, controlling, confident voice.  Rather his voice sounds strong at times, but is usually more reserved andcautious.  This cautious tone makes the album all the more believable, showing it is true emotion that has not been overproduced or forced.<br />I really can not say enough good things about this album and if I could give 10 stars, I would.  As I said, my favorite tracks are #1 Delicate, #6 Amie and #9 I Remember, but there is not a bad song on the album.<br />As one other reviewer already said, my only complaint is that the last song (Eskimo) has 2 \\"hidden tracks\\" [Prague, and Silent Night (a song set to the tune of the traditional Silent Night Christmas song, but with different lyrics)] that should have been seperate tracks finishing off the album with 12 instead of 10. But as my only complaint, I must still recommend this album.<br />E-mail me if you have any questions whatsoever.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Happy to see that there are still people writing opinions on this movie though this is not a latest  one. Actually this film was first shown at cinemas here two years ago.  The shots chosen as promotion ad on tv made me feel it's just a movie packed with glamour costumes and dancers and I was misguided into thinking that it's not worth seeing so I ignored it.  <BR>A couple of weeks ago,I spotted a moulin rouge vcd among other 'old movies' on a shelf at Blockbuster. I rented it as a 'late night show' that night.  Without great expectation, I sat back and started watching it. Since the beginning of the film, I had been attracted to it as the camera swooped across Paris in black and white, backed up with the opening song 'nature boy' (I didn't know what the song was at that moment yet). Wow, the melody fitted the tone of the movie perfectly.  Then it appeared Christian, who started to retell his story... I sat in my armchair, became more and more absorbed in the songs, the acting, the entire movie.  I kept sitting there for a few moments longer, thinking over all that had happened as the credits were rolling on the screen at the end of the movie, which I'd never done before. You know, more often you'll just switch it off right after a movie ends.  It's really a surprise to me.  <BR>The rearrangement of old songs was superb. Together with the songs in the movie, Nicole, Ewan and other supporting roles help to boost the movie up to the best of the best. Not to mention, the director did a great job.  Nicole is a wonderful actress and I like her previous movies such as 'To die for' and 'The others&quot; and she was the main reason for me to see 'Moulin Rouge'.  But this is Ewan who steals the movie.  I'd never seen a single movie of his before.  I'm mesmerized by his charm and voice. He's really a talented actor. As quoted from an interview with the director before the movie was shown on screen, Baz said that Ewan was his 'secret weapon' in the movie, I'm sure that the movie has won thousands of hearts through this weapon. My husband said he would watch it once again though he thinks it's a kind of 'women's film.  I'm not a keen writer and I don't know how to describe how good the film is. it's just fantastic to me and that's it! <BR>I returned the vcd the next day but at the same time, I bought a vcd. Then I went to HMV for a dvd version the next week. I have an impulse to watch the movie every day and listening to the &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; soundtrack has now become my favourite pastime.
B00005JLYU|5.0|Some people didn't care for the firt movie, so obviously the won't enjoy the second.  But the people who enjoyed the first will enjoy the second so much better.  With more plot, more villians, and more dancing, Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle is the very best they could do to make an awesome sequel that was way better than the first.

0380977788|2.0|When I first picked up Coraline, I was pleasantly surprised at all the awards and reviews on the inside of the cover. But, as the book progressed, I was more and more disappointed. Neil Gaiman has the ability to weave together just the right words to create the most horrible images; if you are looking for a twisted and unnerving story, then Coraline is for you. But as this book is geared for children, I know if I had read this when I was younger it most certainly would have given me nightmares. Actually, the book sounds like it is based on a very bad dream, and the illustrations only add to the disturbing nature of the story. One of the most disquieting images Gaiman creates is that of the \\"other mother\\" who is unaturally tall, has skin as white as a spiders belly, sharp pointed teeth, black buttons for eyes, and worst of all, twitching hands with long red nails like daggers. Equally disagreeable, Coraline finds beings behind the mirror in the hall that were once children, only deprived of their souls and hearts by the other mother and then forgotten. There are several good things about the book, however, one being that Coraline shows real bravery and wit, and Gaiman is very talented in creating imagery that sticks in ones mind. But other then that, I would only recommend it to someone that is a fan of very scary, unnerving books, and certainly not to anyone older then thirteen. So, unless you are one of that select group of people, I would not recommend Coraline to you.
0553382179|5.0|not bought all of those other home organization books over the past 15 years.  This one is simply the best.  I have been a &quot;Flybaby&quot; for the last 3 months and my home is now neater, cleaner and calmer than ever before.  My kids are even voluntarily getting in on the act and are happily giving away toys they no longer love.  My routines have made me more organized and given me more time to be creative.  I love this book.  If only it had been available 15 years ago!
B000002UJQ|5.0|I got this Cd for christmas. Its now august and I have listened to this Cd at least 100 times. It is definetely the best Cd I have ever bought. I recommend you buy this album if you like GOOD music. Every song goes perfectly with the next. The musicianship and creativity of this band is unparelleled by no other.
B00008NG5V|5.0|He's grown a bit musically since &quot;Brushfire Fairytales&quot; with tighter sounds, a bit more reggae/islands flair and better recording.  Highly recommended for August afternoons that turn into casual nights.
B00000JLWW|5.0|James Cameron's vision of a dramatic love story running parallel with the greatest maritime tragedy of our time is all at once grand, terrifying and very emotional. With a running time of over three hours not many directors could have kept the pace so brisk, but Cameron is well known for his skill at story telling and making sure you know where and what is happening at all times.     First and foremost, if you watch this movie with your emotional guard up you are not likely to get the full affect. You have to let yourself truly feel what these two characters are going through to let this movie get a grip on you.  Leo and Kate perform well with a casual script that lays down the ground work of two young people who obviously have immediate chemistry. Leo plays Jack Dawson, a young (poor) traveling artist who inadvertently saves Rose (Kate Winslet), a young Pennsylvanian girl betrothed to a rich snob (played with sneering egocentric guile by Billy Zane) as he finds her ready to jump from the back of the ship. This rescue is a symbolism for the entire movie.  Rose feels trapped in her life and as she witnesses Jack's carefree existence it starts to bring out her spirited side as well.  She wants more than just to marry into a rich family as her mother has forced her to do for her own purposes.      Cameron's underlying message of breaking free of that which is holding you back and to live the way you should could very well be misunderstood as liberal but could also be seen as a revelation to those who can relate.  Cameron does not set out to bash rich people either though.  The other wealthy characters are flawed but overall good people, treating Jack with polite curiosity during a meal in the first class dining room.      As Rose finally defies the marriage arrangement and two start to realize their love, the real tragedy starts.  The iceberg strikes and the ship starts it's long death scene. Thankfully, suspension of disbelief is not needed.  The visuals of the sinking ship are strikingly realistic, especially when the ship splits.  The special effects are incredible and the stark reality of the way some of these people died could be disturbing to watch as bodies fall off the ship, striking things on the way to the icy water.    There is a subplot that gets the whole movie started; The Heart of the Ocean, a huge blue diamond pendant.  It is the focus of a search expedition that brings Rose, and her story out to the site where Titanic sunk.  It brings the movie together, but is forgettable at the same time, which is what I think Cameron wanted.  His stamp of detail is intertwined throughout the movie.      The historical accuracy is pinpoint as well.  Many things that happen around Rose and Jack actually did happen.  From the rich first class passengers characterizations to the discussion between the captain and the President of the Starlight company about speeding up the ship in order to arrive early.  From the gymnasium to the dining room to the suites.  From the officers who helped load people into the boats and allegedly shot some passengers to keep order, to the cook who was seen standing on the back of the ship in it's last seconds before it submerged.  All of it was documented as actually history by at least more than one account.  Cameron did extensive research on the events and only recreated that which was consistent in multiple testimony and/or historical documentation.    Titanic won best picture and best director as well as many other awards, all well deserved. The pre-release bashing due to delays in production made it sour to some who may have expected something different, but it made it sweet to those who are Cameron fans and watched it's gross income rise every week.  In no way was this movie meant to be as popular as it was but it is a credit to Cameron to make something that is not only so obviously personal but to also make it so appealing, engrossing and emotional.    Update: 11/28/2005  I just recently purchased the 3-Disc collectors edition and I have to say this DVD is even more spectactular.  The digital transfer is awesome, great picture and sound.  The deleted scenes even look complete.  There is great one with Jack actually beating the crud out of Lovejoy; for those as observationally astue as I am the scene was in the trailer, but not in the movie.  I for one thought Lovejoy deserved to get pummeled and was glad to be able to see this scene.  The special edition discs are loaded, and I do mean LOADED.  With missing scenes, documetaries on the making of the movie, the trips down to the actual wreckage, time lapsed film of the set construction and a fantastic alternate ending where Bill Paxton's character has an epiphany when he discovers that Rose had the diamond the whole time.  I can't say enough to recommend this Special Edition DVD.

Some achieve everlasting fame (like Star Trek), some disappear after one series - and deserve to.<br />Firefly, a window on the life of disparate characters on the \\"Firefly\\" class cargo ship Serenity is unique.  More reminiscent of the works of John Wyndham than of \\"traditional Sci-Fi, it draws you into it's world thanks to Joss Whedon's clever scripts and sympathetic character development.  Settings, characters and plots are far more believable than the norm for Sci-Fi and identification with the characters hopes and dreams is inevitable.<br />Despite the Fox Network's mismanagement of the series which resulted in poor initial viewing figures and the consequent cancellation of the show, it has built an amazing and massive cult following (calling themselves \\"Browncoats\\").  Fox has responded to a mail campaign regarding the series cancellation with this DVD set which offers ALL the programmes in the series (including 3 unaired episodes) and a host of \\"extras\\".<br />A Firefly film is anticipated in 2004, and, like \\"Buffy The Vampire Slayer\\" (which originally aired in 1992 only to disappear before the phenomenally successful re-incarnation) further series' of Firefly will surely come (hopefully with the original cast).<br />This is a \\"Must-Buy\\" DVD set and pre-ordering is essential.  A chance to own the most original Sci-Fi TV series made.

B00005JM09|5.0|Terminator 3:Rise Of The Machines has got to be one of the coolest movies of the summer! Arnold Schwarzenegger is back as the T-850, a diffrent Terminator sent to protect 22 year old John Connor (Nick Sthal) from the lovly but dangerous TX (Kristanna Loken).The TX is an advanced Terminator that can form into anything it terminates. TX is morphing menace and is a machine underneath. The T-850 isn't the T-800 we see in T2. He's a differnt terminator that comes from future better than ever! This movie is fulled with eye-popping action and excitment! A must see!!
B00008EY9G|5.0|This movie works on many levels. It's a grab you and hold you thriller. It's a mystery. It's a scary story. And it's a psychological masterpiece that keeps you guessing throughout. From a psychology standpoint, the movie reveals something few may see: We all have \\"parts\\" of us that fracture and take control. The goal is to have unity with the good part in control, or at least YOU have control of the good part. This movie doesn't quite end that way, but I won't spell it out since I want you to enjoy the flick. Whether you understand this review or not, you WILL love the movie. I'm buying copies for friends. Get it. See it. See it again. Whew! -- [website]
B00006879E|5.0|This is the best band that has come along in the past 15 years. A truly amazing band and a must have CD.
0783229011|5.0|Since my childhood days of watching episodes of Mister Ed, the talking horse. I often wondered how long it took to teach Mister Ed to just move his lips? The voice man stood in the wings and through his voice. Finally, this little gem came along. I never thought they could pull it off technically and visually adding voice and mouth movement to the animals. And the animals acted so well. Just as convincing as their human counterparts. 'Babe' was such a hit in 1995 that it was nominated in five categories and won one for the visual effects. A very worthy and well-deserved win. 'Babe' can be enjoyed by everyone young and old. I would recommended it as one of my top favorite children's film. As with some fate, Babe is saved from an unfortunate destiny, where all pigs must go. Babe and Farmer Hoggett paths cross at a country fair. Hoggett and Babe from that moment something passed between them. Hoggett guesses the weight of the little pig in a contest. Later that that week, Hoggett is notified as the winner. It's when Hoggett brings Babe to his new home, Babe meets a menagarie of farm animals that take a liking to their new addition to the Hoggett farm. Babe is adopted by Fly, an Australian border collie. Babe makes friends with a duck who thinks he's a rooster as cover from being a main course for Christmas dinner. Babe also makes friends with an ailing old ewe, Ma.<BR><br /><BR> One day, Farmer Hoggett allows Babe to accompany him and the sheepdogs in the fields where the sheep grazed. There Fly teaches Babe the art of being a sheep-pig. But, Babe also learns another valuable lesson in tending sheep. It's a test if Babe is cutout to be a good sheep-pig. With Ma's help the sheep co-operate with Babe. To Farmer Hoggett's amazement in Babe's special gift he enters Babe in annual sheepherding trials. In due time, Babe is put through the practice and confronts wolves who kill one of the sheep. Farmer Hoggett thinking Babe killed one of the sheep. Does it mean the death sentence for poor Babe? But Fly comes to Babe's rescue and saves the day for Babe. There's the jealous, bad cat out to get Babe when she snidely tells Babe of the pig's true purpose. Babe thinking that the Boss would in time eat him, Babe goes to Fly and ask if it were true. When Fly tells Babe the truth, Babe runs away in the rainy night. Next day, Fly and Farmer Hoggett find Babe taken by the cold rain and Hoggett nursed him back to health. Then the big day come and Hoggett and Babe go to the trials with a little surprise for the judges. Can Babe the sheep-pig prove himself good and be the next sheepherding champ? Bet you know the answer already. I'd recommend Babe to anyone of all ages, especially to parents with small children. It's a darling, captivating tale with a lesson for all. Don't let anyone tell you that you can't do something, until you prove them wrong. There's another film about another talking pig, 'Gordy' you may like, too.
0385504209|5.0|I borrowed this book from a friend and, not having anything else to do that Saturday afternoon (I live in DC;  it was raining for a change), lay down and started reading this book.  After I finished it, I went downstairs and had a late dinner.  Very late, obviously-- this is hardly a short book; however, neither is it boring or slow or uninteresting.  The obvious flaws were sub-plot points that will surprise few and disappoint even fewer, and the blatantly obvious high point was the storyline itself.  Religion, math, murder, intrigue, history-- somehow Brown ties it all together.<br />This is a great beach or rainy weekend book.  Enjoy.
B00008OM7U|5.0|This was my introduction to the world of &quot;Gothic Punk.&quot; I was 14 and had never heard anything remotely like this, but the songs on this album hooked me fast. Lords of the New Church has quite a bit of songwriting talent. Dave Tregunna, although not the best bass player I have heard, plays some of the catchiest and most simple and original lines in songs like Johnny Too Bad and Dance With Me. Stiv Bator's voice has plenty of attitude and his lyrics are really cool in a trashy way. If you like the Damned you'll recognize their former guitarist Brian James who plays really cool guitar figures against the bass lines. They top it off with some sick 50's esque horn lines too! Overall this is a great rock and roll record. I would highly recommend this to any fans of the Damned and anyone who wants to hear how great and refreshingly simple a rock record can be!
B00005JKN9|1.0|this film was very dissappointing. a mediocre tv movie is the result of the hard work of many people.<BR>the story is boring, a stupid revenge plot. the setup could have been interesting - new york/americas in its childhood - but the makers give it away. well, maybe the artists behind this work are simply overrated?
B00005JKZV|3.0|The Two Towers is a movie worth owning on DVD, but it was not as good as the Fellowship of the Ring. I'll get to the bottom line. They left out 7! chapters of the movie. Thats one star lost. Oh, and then they added some scenes that weren't at all necessary to the plot and made the movie no better, and whats more, if they didn't put these useless scenes in, they would have had time to put in the chapters they left out. This is another star deducted. If you ignore these facts, then it was a great movie, especially if you haven't read the books. Peter Jackson had better make a come back in Return of the King, or the whole trilogy will be ruined.

B000000OQF|5.0|'Guns N'Roses'... By all accounts terrible when they first started out in 1985, since attitude alone will only take you so far,touring the US toilet circuit....But this was all soon to change.... In August '86 after the initial 10000 copies of their limited edition EP 'Live?!@LIke A Suicicde' sold out in a matter of days, records lables swarmed around them like moths to a lamp. And so it was Geffen who released their full length debut the following year...And what a debut...<BR> From Axl's first wails in the opening track 'Welcome to a Jungle' to Slash's heart rending finishing guitar riffs in 'Rocket Queen' the glamour and ambition that was to be Guns N'Roses reared its head for the first time and took its place amongst the stars.<BR> This may give the initial impression that 'Appertite' was to be packed with tales of extravegance and excess in glitzy Hollywood.<BR>In reality this would be very much not the case as through Axl's ruthlessly clear eyed honesty a very different portrait was to be painted.<BR> Taking a blue print of sex, drugs and good-time rock n'roll filled out with the day to day realitites of a struggling small time band in downtown L.A and it certaintly wasn't to be a pretty picture... In fact, it was more akin to lifting a big stone and watching all the pale insects beneath squirming around in the light rather than the so called glitz and glam of Hollywood.<BR> This album is frantic and sensational from start to finish with no filler songs... with opener 'Welcome to the Jungle', Axl treats us to a breackneck guided tour of Los Angeles while promising,\\"Your gonna die...!\\"<BR> There are songs about getting loaded-'Nighttrain and the hymn to heroin 'Mr Brownstone'- and Axl at his most paranoid in 'Out Ta Get Me'. But equally women draw the short straw on Appetite being seen largly as stupid and rapacious sex objects ('My Michelle', 'You're Crazy'). In fact the initial artwork for the cover of the album, featuring a badly drawn cartoon where a womenhad apparently been raped by a robot (?!) was withdrawn after a barrage of protests.<BR> However, women deffinetly come of best in the tender ballad 'Sweet child O'mine'. In contrast to what surrounds it  this adds a whole extra dimension to the album, as Axl reveals his tendar side in quite possibly the most sensitive lyrics he has ever written: \\"Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place/Where as a child i'd hide/And pray for the thunder and rain/To quitely pass me by.....I'd hate to look into those eyes/And see an ounce of pain.\\" With its distinctive warbling guitar intro, courtesy of Slash, it has become one of the most popular rock ballads of all time. Appetite quickly became the most influential album of the 80s and spawned hundreds of imitators (Take a bow Sea Hags) but none ever achieved the success or lived to the excess and weaved the legends of their fights, extravagances, tantrums, short lived marriages... the general over the top lifestyle, the ongoing XXX rated soap opera littered with needles, booze, tatts,busted heads,law suits fueding band members and the greatest rock songs the world has ever heard..... This is the best album ever recorded, period.... Appetite is a must buy, period....A real pity it lasted only one more double album....:-(
B00009RGBS|5.0|The advent of the stage musical was driven by a young American society seeking an English speaking opera which could combine the talents of American Jazz, the celebration of the American spirit, and provide a hopeful look at life. This was even more evident during the depression. During the 60's and 70's the musical took on different life forms. The ideals that theatre was a vehicle of social awareness did not limit the genre to only three act dramas guaranteed to make us angry. The musical saw this through an enormous success of \\"Hair\\". Then we saw \\"A Chorus Line\\", \\"Sweeny Todd\\",\\"Cabaret\\" and a string of shows with a sociological edge to them. When \\"Chicago\\" opened it was met with mixed reviews, and did not really enjoy its deserved recognition until it's Broadway revival in the 1990's. <br />\\"Chicago\\" was not meant to celebrate killers, or adultery, or crooked lawyers. That is not the point. \\"Chicago\\" takes a look at<BR>the society that was overlooked in the early part of the century. The mobsters, the crime, and the fact that we let killers manipulate the press and become heroes. This is a story of just how [mentally challenged] people can be, and how enamored they can become by sensational stories. Even based on truth that become distorted. I would imagine that a musical about OJ Simpson and Scott Peterson would be a more modern take.<br />The execution of the story with its fast paced attention to detail makes this a film. The way that the producers stayed true to the score makes this a surprise. <br />So, people who see this film as a movie celebrating killers really miss the boat. This film is all about how our society is more interested in how the press makes killers into famous people. That is the core, and that is the idea everyone should remember. If we could send a message to the press that we do not want Scott Peterson to have any press time at all, things in this country would get a bit better. Thanks \\"Chicago\\" for reminding us of that.
B00000I0XW|3.0|I love Sarah's voice. Her &quot;Time To Say Goodbye&quot; in Andrea Bocelli's &quot;Romanza&quot; was out of this world. But I was totally disappointed by the way Sarah presented those famous tunes in this album. She failed when she tried to sing differently from the original singer. Those changes were too dramatic and unnecessary.
B000002UA2|4.0|It's pretty clear why this album has been comparatively underlooked in the Pink Floyd discography, like More before it, it's a soundtrack album with a fair deal of instrumental mood music. However, this one stands out more than More, because it's less eclectic and hit and miss, and stylistically and lyrically there's a lot of foreshadowing of Darkside Of The Moon. The songs are mostly good to great (the beautiful, folky \\"Whot's... Uh The Deal\\", the grandiose and most Darkside-like \\"Childhood's End\\", and the catchy but morbid lyrically \\"Free Four\\" are standouts), and even the instrumentals are all cool except for the annoying \\"Absolutely Curtains\\". Not a first purchase by any means, but a good buy if you're already a fan.
0385509456|4.0|Anyone looking for a fabulous, fast read ought to put Mark Haddon's latest on the short list.  On the VERY short list, even.  Well written, quirky, experimental without being overly complicated, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is my favorite read of the summer.<br />A 15 year old boy who is incapable of understanding the emotions of those around him, and who is limited in his own ability to feel things, is the centerpiece of the story. While severly handicapped in the arena of human emotions, Christopher is blessed with a sharp mind for remembering  details and for thinking logically.   Determined to solve the mysterious death of a neighbor's dog, and then consumed by the even greater mystery of his parents' marriage, Christopher chronicles his discoveries with unflinching accuracy.  Haddon's writing allows the reader to see the inner workings of an individual cloaked in the veil of autism, someone who in real life one might never understand.<br />Full of math references and occassional nods to popular culture, the novel rapidly builds momentum and sustains it throughout.  <BR>The book is darkly comical and full of irony, and Haddon keeps his writing  a respectable distance from being either too sentimenal or too clincal.  Readers who themselves may not have a good grasp on the range of human emotion might find the story puzzling, but for anyone who has dealt with autistic persons in real life, the book creates a character whose vulnerability and honesty ring true.
0446677450|5.0|This book (and several others written by Kiyosaki) have changed my way of thinking about money, wealth, jobs, business ownership, investing, etc.  Little changes bring about rewards beyond belief.  I am still working on making my first million but I have no doubt I will make it - thanks in part to this book.  <br />I bought a copy of this book for all my friends and each of my children.  Most people thought I had went off the deep end (some still do!) but I caught the fever of wanting more and haven't looked back since.  I continue to recommend it to young people that have the slightest interest in creating something phenomenal.<br />Many &quot;schooled&quot; people and others who grew up around money education have scoffed at the simplicity of this book.  But for those of us who never learned about anything more about money than trying to pay the bills every month, this book has been a revelation.
0802130208|4.0|In lieu of adding to the myriad of opinions and analysis over this particular book, I want to offer a suggestion for the reader who wants to get through this, but is reluctant.. the key that finally unlocked this work was, for me, imagining Ignatius as the comic book store owner from the Simpsons.

B000002I2G|4.0|This is, admittedly, The Doors' weakest effort.  Despite all the talk about Morrison being overrated and hyped as the driving force behind the band (he was--check out the post-Morrison Doors albums to see how well they did without him), the reason is that by this time Morrison had pretty much given up on The Doors and music in general as vehicles with which to change the world.  Morrison was looking for far, far more than commercial success, and he probably never found it.  Nonetheless, there are captivating moments which remind us of The Doors explosive potential (&quot;The Soft Parade&quot;/&quot;Wishful/Sinful&quot;) and demonstrate the bands superiority to their flower power contemporaries.  The truth is that any Doors effort involving Morrison, even minimally, deserves attention.

B000092T6M|5.0|After reading others' reviews I was pesimistic about the DVD. Many people mentioned the disc having to be turned over on the second side to see the second half of the movie and poor A/V quality. My only guess is they are refering to the theatrical release. The extended edition has the entire movie on a 1 sided disc. The sound and picture quality are great. The bonus features disc even includes the entire musical score in Dolby 5.1. Very nice additon.<br />The movie was everything I remembered and more. A few new scenes are a bit odd but others are hilarious. More scenes of the Sherrif is better. Definately worth the price tag.
B00009V7RF|5.0|This is an album of that covers a pretty wide array of music.  Unfortunately someone who wasn't very educated on this type of music wrote a review \\"a music fan\\" from \\"somewhere rational\\".  I recently took my girlfriend to a Justin Timberlake/Christina Aguilera concert (I'm 22, and yes I went) and the Peas opened for them and put on a pretty cool show.  It made it even more worthwhile for me.  The big acts were pretty awesome too.  Justin is an awesome performer hiself.  I got something pretty awesome out of the deal (5th row John Mayer tickets on Saturday which I am very excited about).  This cd is what it's branded as...Funk.  Some songs are a bit sexually charged, but so what??  And who cares if a song is called Let's Get Retarded?? Be open-minded...There are plenty of words that take double meanings these days.  I recommend this album, and I was never a fan of the Peas.  Now I am.
B000002J1U|5.0|led zeppelin 1 and 2 showed the music community that the band was extraordinarily talented in the combination of blues and heavy rock, but what cemented zeppelin as one of the greatest rock bands ever started with this gem. on Led Zeppelin III, the band experiments with acoustic folk material, and it really works. it shows the band's now undeniable versitility. it was overlooked in it's time despite of the radio success of &quot;Immigrant Song&quot;, but now it is seen as one of zeppelin's most underrated and greatest albums.
B000001DYA|5.0|Before Black Sabbath and Deep Purple, there was this San Francisco (where else?) trio, the purveyors of loud, sludgey blues-rock that would rise at the beginning of the '70s.  Arguably the first heavy metal release.  This debut LP from 1968, though severely underproduced but nonetheless intense, features a barrage of blues-based hard-rock-turned-psychedelic-fuzz-feedback-metal assault, including a cover of Eddie Cochran's \\"Summertime Blues,\\" which would ultimately prove to be their signature song.  Needless to say, very essential.
B00003CXPD|5.0|\\"Billy Elliot\\" is one of the all-time best movies I have ever seen.  I've raised two boys of my own, and let me tell you, Jamie Bell's portrayal of adolescent angst, boy-style is flawless.  I've actually witnessed my thirteen year-old son pound something and then punch the air in impotent rage as Billy did after his father forbade him to take any more dance lessons, and when Billy's teacher chastised him for not practicing and Billy angrily responded that he couldn't do what she was asking, my son, recognizing the problem immediately, sagely stated,\\"He can't do it because he's angry.\\"  When Billy told off his teacher for always telling him what to do \\"the same as everybody else,\\" I asked my daughter if it reminded her of anybody, and she laughed and said,\\"Yeah, Brian! (the aforementioned 13 year old).  When Billy danced out his anger and frustration at not being heard and at having no control over anything that was happening to him or to his family, and then came smack up against a wall, pounding it and giving it one last elbow-jab before sinking into sullen silence, Brian, again recognizing himself, said, \\"I make that face.\\"  It's hard to believe that Jamie Bell had almost no acting experience before he made this movie.  I believe he is going to be a force to reckon with in the movie world.<br />Aside from Jamie Bell's spectacular acting and dancing, the other characters were perfectly cast and acted. Julie Walters (Educating Rita) as the chain-smoking dance teacher who both mothers and pushes Billy to the limit is at her absolute best, as is Gary Lewis as the grieving, angry, bewildered father.<br />The story itself was at once heartbreaking and heartwarming without being either contrived or shmaltzy.  One does not have to be a boy who has recently lost his mother, and who'd rather dance than box, to relate to Billy's struggle to deal with adversity and to be accepted for who he is.  I couldn't stop watching.
B0000011P7|5.0|Of Ian's solo albums, I think this one is the best.  I have it on 331/3 and played it to ruin.  Am pruchasing on CD now and here because it is soooo hard to find.  The first side is better than side two but this still ranks as Ian's best solo effort.
B00009TB5G|5.0|\\"Two Towers\\" is an awesome movie. If you haven't seen it in theaters (which I think is almost impossible, everyone's seen it) order this now! The movie was a great adaptation from the book (which I've read 56 times, and counting) and you should really listen to those purist people if your normal and just looking for a good movie. <br />*Spoiler*<br />My only bone to pick is with the part where Aragorn falls off the cliff. If you've read the book(s) you know how silly that is (Aragorn DOESN'T fall off cliffs that easy) and how it doesn't seem very Tolkien-ish in its style.<br />Other than that, its great, and the features seem really cool. I'm getting it.
B00000K0EA|5.0|This has to be my favorite Bond movie, good plot, good gadgets, GREAT female leads (kudos to Mss. Yeoh and Hatcher!) and Pierce Brosnan make for an excellent movie!  <br />I still think Sean Connery is the quintessential Bond, but Mr. Brosnan ably walks in his shoes.  If I were a Bond novice, I would still start with the earlier movies, but this is a wonderful addition to the series.
B000002UJQ|5.0|A friend asked me the other day if I could bring only one album onto a desert island for one year, what it would be.  I answered, almost without thought, Ok Computer.  When I first listened to anything by Radiohead that wasn't on a radio station (I think that was Creep) it was Ok Computer.  I didn't like it very much, mainly due to York's voice.  I put off listening to the album off for awhile.  Then I started listening to it again one day and slowly got hooked.  There is as much beautifully crafted and even hidden music on this album to rival (yes, I mean it) Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.  It's that good.  If you pick it up, don't let it leave your CD player until you've heard the enitre album at least ten times.  Then you'll realize what I'm talking about (if not before).  Stupendous, superb, plain superlative.
B00005JLXE|1.0|As I watched the pathetic CGI rat stumble through the opening, I remember thinking, \\"uh-oh.\\"  The rest of the movie was only slightly better.  Stiff acting, terrible dialogue and really bad special effects.  You've much better things to do with your time.
B00005JKZV|5.0|The first time I watched \\"The Two Towers\\" I was a little confused and disappointed.  I was expecting the movie to follow the book a lot closer.  The second time I saw it I put the book out of mind completely and found the movie brilliant.  Granted Peter Jackson did use some artistic license with the story line, but I think it's for the better.  After reading the trilogy for probably the 10th time, I think it would have been difficult for him to follow the story line to the letter.<br />Before criticizing the movie, you need to understand even though millions have read the Trilogy, the majority of people haven't.  I took my nephews to see the Fellowship and then The Two Towers.  Neither of them have read the Trilogy.  When we left the theatre after The Two Towers I felt a little disappointed, while my nephews couldn't wait to see it again.  The difference is I went in with Tolkien blinders, whereas they didn't.  I was anticipating the plot, they were living it.<br />If you found this movie a disappointment, see it again.  But this time, forget about the book.  Live the plot, scene by scene.  It is a remarkable movie.  The movie \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" has the same shortcoming.  The movie portrayed Nash as a totally different character than the nut he was in real life.  Forgetting the book, it was great movie.<br />My only disappointment with \\"The Two Towers\\" was the deleted scenes.  From what I heard there's going to be about 42 minutes of new footage in the special edition DVD.  As with the Fellowship, these deleted scenes filled quite a few gaps, especially for those that read the book.  I would have preferred seeing a longer, complete movie in the theatre than having to wait almost a year later to fill in the pieces.
B00009RDG9|2.0|2 stars for a movie that stinks you ask? Well, yeah. I'll give one star to Benicio Del Toro for his appearance in this movie. It is not Del Toro's fault however, that whomever edited this picture must have left the best scenes on the cutting room floor. Or perhaps William Friedkin just doesn't know how to direct a movie of this calliber. <BR>Tommy Lee Jones is ageing nicely, but after The Fugative and whatever that sequel was, it is more like seeing Clint Eastwood repriving the exact same role, except Clint is better. I really enjoyed Mr. Jones in Space Cowboys - so you see he can play a different role other than the \\"I know everything about everything and you don't\\" crap that he once again gets handed here. <BR>The movie dares to bring up \\"Combat Stress Disorder\\" and that is about 1 minute of the movie. Why it was brought up in the first place is just an excuse for the movie.  <BR>For about the last 30 minutes of the movie there is the typical, but somewhat slow in this case, final chase scene. When the good and bad finally meet, it can't be over soon enough. In my version of the movie, Mr. Del Toro would have killed Mr. Jones and snuck away for perhaps a shot at the directors throat and maybe the editor(s) of the film as well. As is, I wasn't involved in the production so this is the studios way of ending such a fine flick:<BR>Good guy gets stabbed and slashed until he's ready to start making a comeback, this reminded me a lot of WWF and Hulk Hogan, it was that bad! And, although Mr. Jones should have no blood in his body by now it doesn't seem to affect him for the rest of the movie. Remember just 5 minutes earlier? Apparently, if you can pull a stick/spear out of your leg, it will only bleed for 20-30 seconds at most, will not bleed in a river, and will be ready to walk on again in 1 minute. <BR>I couldn't wait for this movie to end, ohhh the other star you ask? Simple enough, Connie Nielsen is drop dead gorgeous. Too bad she plays the dumb cop (not her fault) and has meaningless scenes to boot. <BR>Final words about this movie - It's 15-20 minutes too long and it may have been written well, but it got shafted on the budget and so the movie is predictable and meaningless.
B0000959N0|2.0|Okay. I found this film (on DVD) disappointing.  I was a DareDevil comic book fan back in &quot;the day&quot;, but I've long since forgotten the story.  This film starts out pretty good with the story of the development of DD and how he lost his dad and gained supersensory powers.  The fight scenes were pretty good, but other than these two things, the film just doesn't make it.  The villians do much more for this film than DD himself.  Ben Affleck doesn't get the job done!  His love interest helps, but dies (as does the film)  Rent it if youl haven't seen it --DON'T buy it.  SpiderMan was tremendously superior!!
B000002MTU|5.0|Eric Clapton has composed and performed some of the most beautiful love ballads in rock history: Wonderful Tonite, Please Be With Me, and Let it Flow are all guaranteed to mellow you out and start sparks flying with your spouse or loved one. Relax as Eric's gentle acoustic guitar and soooothing voice....<BR>Wait a minute! This is not that kind of album!!! Nor is it an album of superlong, rock and roll masterpieces like Layla.<BR>This is a BLUES album, an album of strickly blues, hardcore blues and nothing but blues. Here, Eric assembles an incredible band, featuring superharpist Jerry Portnoy, one of the finest harmonica players ever to pick up the instrument, and records a superb collection of live-in-the-studio standards. Even though some of these songs, such as Blues Before Sunrise and It Hurts Me Too, have been recorded hundreds of times before, these new versions rank as some of the finest ever. And the vocals!!! Eric literally growls and sings with a passion unequaled in most of his earlier work. The man is literally singing his heart out, afraid it might pop out through his chest at any moment. And his guitar playing!!! Listen to the fabulous solo on Someday After a While or the Robert-Johnson derived lead-in that opens Blues Before Sunrise and the album. You know in an instant you're in guitar heaven! So, if you want great blues by a master, this is the CD for you. If you want Mellow Eric, try a different address, say 461 Ocean Blvd.
B00006RCNW|5.0|Definetly the best show on TV today.  Can't wait for season 3
B00009TB5G|5.0|The movie is exceptional. It's scale is mindboggling. The battle of helms deep had me shouting praise for my favorite characters as they chopped down their enemies. The ents attacking Isengard was extraordinarily done. The score is brilliant and I have to say I prefer it to the fellowship soundtrack where the first 6 or 7 songs are all variations of the black riders theme of loud screaming choir. *ug* (Though admittedly the rest is quite good). And as with tFotR, the casting of characters in the Two Towers is right on the mark. My hat is off to Peter Jackson for getting the technical job done right.<br />I do have a problem with the story changes. There was a reason why Tolkien wrote things the way he did. Changing Faramir's personality to be a power hungry mongrel is not fair. Faramir was a brave and noble fellow and though Peter might redeem him later, Faramir's character is now blemished. Adding elves at helms deep is also a mistake. In Tolkien's story valliant men overcame insurmountable odds and resisted darkness. Now they are weak and need pansy elves to help them. Before men had the power and strength in their own hearts to achieve victory but in this version they don't. In Tolkien's version the ents choose to help fight evil, in this version they decide not to and then get tricked into helping sort of last-minutey. Thus the ents are now brash creatures that respond to events on a moment to moment basis. It's a small part of the story, but it makes the characters less than they are in the novel. Tolkien believed in the character's choice to stand up to evil. Peter Jackson apparently decided that it's more interesting to throw in more struggle. It doesn't hurt the film, but it isn't as true to Tolkien's war of the Ring as it could be. So I think it's up to you to decide how much these changes will impact your overall enjoyment of the film.
B00005OAIE|4.0|Don't get me wrong John Mayer makes good music and ya ya the whole Dave Matthews comparison???<br />BUT can anyone say BIG HEAD TODD AND THE MONSTERS??? This sounds EXACTLY like BIG HEAD TODD AND THE MONSTERS and they have been creating GREAT music like Mayer since the late 80's. Its just ashame the BIG HEAD TODD AND THE MONSTERS are so underrated and unappreciated. Like I said Mayer has good stuff but let's not forget his sound has been around. It's ALL-relative
6302642256|5.0|I just watched this movie last night and I would have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  I was surprised at how this movie was very entertaining and it has special effects that rivals today's movies.  My favorite line was when the alien ship (Max) says to a fat dude: \\"Too much twinkles eh...oink, oink!\\"  Hahaha, that just got me off guard...i couldn't believe an alien would be talking smack! I was rolling in laughter!  Thats one classic line and now i'm using it on my good cousin Derrick!
B0000A1RJI|5.0|I have ridden the ride 3 times.  Most recent was in 1997 and I can remember how awesome that ride was.  When I heard the movie was coming out I was THRILLED.  I absolutely love the movie and I think it is the best of the summer...Now I have the score and can say that Klaus Badelt has entered my TOP COMPOSERS list.  Along with the master John Williams, Hans Zimmer and the like.  I am a little dissapointed that Yo Ho (A Pirate's Life For Me) didn't make it in there.  Other than that it is a beautiful soundtrack and kind of reminds me of Hans Zimmer's The Rock soundtrack.  Which I also love.  Seriously if you like the movie or love movie scores than you HAVE to buy this one.  Excellent soundtrack.
B00005JKC3|5.0|Was it better than \\"Spiderman\\" yes.<BR>Was it better than \\"Daredevil\\" yes.<BR>Was it better than \\"X2:X-Men United\\" not quite.<BR>But this was one of the best adaptations of a comic book.<BR>Eric Bana stars as Bruce Banner a scientist with past problems.<BR>After being exposed to a chemical in his lab all his anger is released and he becomes the Hulk.Jennifer Connelly & Nick Nolte<BR>are perfectly cast as his girlfriend and his father.But anyway<BR>the story starts with Bruces father being arrested because of blowing up a research center.When he takes Bruces mom into their bedroom,something happens that changes Bruces life forever.<BR>Thinking his parents are dead he becomes a scientist and meets<BR>his girlfriend.After a mysterious man is hired as the janitor at Bruces lab,he discovers its his father.Now before I ruin the movie for you I just wanna say the special effects in this movie are great.The Hulk looks absolutely amazing and this movie is worth seeing<BR>SEE YOU AT THE STORE
B0000BWVCM|5.0|This is the not-so-rare installment thats better than the first.<BR>The movie is basically about Wolverines search about his past and he eventually finds it but I don't want to give too much away.Rouge and Iceman are now boyfriend and girlfriend and they inttroduce Pyro.A mutant who can create fire!!! They also introduce Night Crawler.A blue mutant who can shoot through walls,among other things.Mystique the blue mutant thought dead from the original shows a more feminine sexy side in this one.<br />The movie became one of the most popular movies in America before<BR>\\"The Matrix Reloaded\\" and \\"Bruce Almighty\\".This movie is a must see,do not miss it.<BR>Bottom Line:<BR>See this movie now!!!
B00003CXCW|5.0|This film is a collision between Film Noir and the Grand Guignol tradition of old Europe. The mangling of the old and new creates the oddest and scariest of tensions. The script is structured so solidly that the viewer is drawn in as inexorably as a fly into a web. One of the finest films Hollywood has ever produced, it is also one of the most brutal in it's view of Hollywood. This a film to study, to watch again and again.
B000002UZ1|5.0|This is a farorite CD ever! The Beatles music has been a big part of my life for many years! This collection is a must for any fan! I recommend the red cd also and all other Bealtes cd are great! Money well spent on all things Beatles!!!
B00004WGAI|5.0|Timothy Dalton is the only Mr. Rochester. This two tape VHS is the best &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; to date. This also was a made-for-TV film. This Jane is an unknown actress, and she is the best one yet. I have seen four or five versions of this classic, and the only one I have watched more than once is this one. The movie follows the book almost precisely, the characters fit wonderfully, and this Jane is actually plain, yet conveys the idea of beauty. It's a bit on the long side, but if you've read the book (and you shouldn't see the movie without reading the book first) you'll appreciate it.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Like any Radiohead album, repeated listenings will create more interest in 'HTTT'. &quot;There There&quot; is the first single, fit for modern rock consumption. That same idea doesn't seem like the same band that refused to support the #1 album KID A with any publicity three years ago. So, does this album return the boys to their &quot;The Bends&quot; days? No, a band this progressive only moves foward on HTTF, with just some instances of looking back. I debated whether to rate 'HTTT' 5 stars, due to its lack of a continuous sound. But, look at the 'White Album' and its variety. Like all Radiohead's masterpieces (KID A sorta warned againt cloning, OK Computer showed us how bland our lives can be with technology and machines taking something away from the man), HTTT seeks to indirectly warn us of the rise of Ultra-conservative governments. Songs like &quot;The Gloaming&quot; and &quot;Go to Sleep&quot; show how apparent the paranoia of HTTT is.
0140177396|5.0|Migrant workers George Milton and Lennie Small are the best of friends, though they are complete opposites.  Lennie, the big man, provides companionship for George, while George, physically small, takes care of Lennie because Lennie is mentally weak.  Sometimes, though, George can get really frustrated and angry at Lennie when he does something wrong, probably without meaning to.  But Lennie is so loyal to George that George can't be mad at him for a long time.<br />In the story, they find jobs at a farm, where they meet personalities such as Slim, the intelligent, repected leader, Candy, the old, disabled handyman, Crooks, the black, isolated stableworker, Carlson, an insensitive ranch hand, Curley, a mean little guy who is the owner's son, and Curley's wife, a &quot;tart&quot;.  Things at the farm seem to be going alright for awhile, until their spirits are uplifted for a moment and then brought crashing down in an inevitable chain of events.  Many of the events in this book appear to be completely random, and Steinbeck even thought about titling it &quot;Something That Happened&quot; just to show that this world is unpredictable.<br />The nature of dreams is a powerful theme in the novel.  George and Lennie have always had a dream of one day owning their own farm, where they can be secure from the outside world and will not have to worry about Lennie's costly mistakes.  The dream gives their lives meaning, a reason to keep going on.  George never really believes they can do it, but Lennie embraces it with childlike enthusiasm and keeps it alive.  Of course, Lennie wants the farm so that he can take care of the rabbits.  But when Candy and Crooks offer their stakes to join in, George begins to see that this could be for real and starts to make tentative plans to start the next month.  However, Lennie's human imperfection makes the dream ultimately impossible.  <br />Loneliness is also a big theme throughout the story.  The migrant workers we meet travel alone, andtheir lives are just a set routine.  George and Lennie are not very lonely, since they have each other, but pairs like them are not normal or common.  Candy, Crooks and Curley's wife are all very lonely, and they try to fight their isolation whatever way they can.  Curley's wife flirts with the ranchers against her husbands's demands.  Near the ranch is a town called Soledad, which means &quot;solitude&quot; or &quot;alone&quot;.<br />All in all, this is a nice, short, thought-provoking read and my favorite Steinbeck book.  Steinbeck does a great job in capturing the character's emotions, thoughts, and feelings.  One memorable scene is when Curley picks a fight with Lennie and starts punching him hard.  Lennie is scared stiff and takes the abuse until George yells at him to fight back.  Lennie then crushes all the bones in Curley's hand.  This is a very dark story of brutal inhumane experiences, sadness and obstacles.  Enjoy.
B000066C6Z|5.0|My first viewing of \\"Top Secret!\\" was a bit off-putting. I loved the off-the-wall humor of \\"Airplane!\\", but what was _this_? Apparently, a lot of other people reacted the same way, because \\"Top Secret!\\" bombed badly at the box office, despite a measly budget of $8M.<br />The second time -- and every time thereafter -- it was hilarious. The problem -- as ZAZ are quick to admit on the running commentary -- is that it's a mix of genres -- Elvis musicals combined with WWII spy films. It's disorienting -- the _first_ time you see it. The following times (of which there's likely to be many), you can just sit back and howl at the crazy jokes and non-sequitur humor.<br />There's another reason to own \\"Top Secret!\\" -- it has one of _the_ great scenes in the history of motion pictures. Remember the incredibly long single take Orson Welles starts \\"Touch of Evil\\" with? ZAZ do the same thing, except... Well, you have to see it to believe it.
0064407667|4.0|Having read some of the bad reviews regarding book one of the series, I must say that those reviewers must give the series a chance.  Upon finishing book one, I too did not quite know what to make of a silly little book where nothing good ever happens to three orphans.  I must say that it really wasn't until I finished the third book that I really understood and felt the tone of the series.  You are not meant to really feel bad for our small heroes, but merely enjoy the events that follow.  As the orphans get moved around from house to house, their plight becomes more and more ridiculous and enjoyable.  Unfortunately, Book One does not have time enough to develop the orphans enough for us to become invested in them.  After reading more books in the series, you will root and laugh at the orphans in much the same way we wanted the crew from the Minnow to get off the deserted island.  Very few books make me laugh out loud, and this series does!  If you stick with the series, I defy you not to get hooked!
B0000A1RJI|5.0|Since buying this soundtrack 3 weeks ago, I've probably listened to it 100 times - no exaggeration - at work, at home and in the car.  The reason I bought the soundtrack was because the movie was awesome but after the first time listening, I was hooked from that point on.  I look forward to the movie sequel in a couple of years to see what Klaus Badelt/Composer has created.

B00005T30L|5.0|\\"Ghost World\\" is a film that champions the struggles of those of us who just never feel like we belong.  Every day we see people blindly following the herd without a second thought.  We see the world around us drained of character, only to be replaced by cardboard, corporate cutouts and endless miles of Starbucks, Home Depots, Borders and strip malls.  Everywhere the lemmings hail this homogenization of American culture as progress.  But for the few that simply cannot will themselves into this state of blissful ignorance, there is \\"Ghost World\\", a film that chronicles the confusion and frustration that comes with the burden of being an individual.<br />This film offers intelligent and scathing humor both in the sarcastic and biting dialogue of it's characters and in the film's skewering of modern pop culture.  In addition to humor though, \\"Ghost World\\" also offers the sadness and loneliness of a life lived on the outside of what is considered 'normal' by the masses.  In the end we are presented with doses of both hope and fear. Fear for the amount of willpower it takes to remain an individual in a world that is constantly pressuring everyone to tow the line, and hope that the world is a big place in which to eventually find your niche.  After all, it isn't easy when, as Steve Buscemi's characters says, you \\"...can't relate to 99% of humanity.\\"

0767802659|2.0|Every other reviewer talks of the Melrose Place cast or the special effects of Starship Troopers.  I'd like to look at the movie from a Military / Sci-Fi perspective.  That is what Starship Troopers is supposed to be, after all.    Sigh!  With all that money in the budget, Verhoeven could have made something great.  The book (which was OK, not great) share little in common except the title and the Bugs.  Still, the movie could have taken middling material, and made it better.  On rare occasions, movies are actually better than the books they imitate -- Lord of the Rings comes to mind.    Troopers, unfortunately, doesn't step up to the plate.  Verhoeven often shows flashes of brilliance, but it's a shallow genius, balking at exploring his ideas with any depth (In Hollowman, for example, a promising start degenerates into a slasher fest in the cliched underground laboratory.)  Instead of wasting screen time on \\"High School of the Future,\\" other elements could have been explored.  Half the movie was over before humanity really engaged the Bugs.    From a sci-fi standpoint, ST gets an \\"F.\\"  The bug planets all looked like the Mojave Desert.  Starships turn corners in space, flying around like airplanes.  Brain bugs suck gray matter out of peoples heads, and somehow assimilate the knowledge (Akin to recovering data from a shattered CD-ROM).  And on, and on, and on...    Militarily, ST is rubbish.  Couldn't Verhoeven have hired a military advisor?  Please?  Tactics, equipment... all was awful!  Why would starships crowd so close to each other, playing crash-up derby when attacked? -- planetary orbit is an ENORMOUS chunk of real estate.  Why were the troopers always unsupported?  Where were their heavy weapons?  The mini-nukes were cute, used twice, and too powerful.    Another wasted opportunity.
0385486804|5.0|I literally could not put this book down, it kept me up too late. This story is fascinating. It was great to read about someone who had the guts to carry out his dreams. This kid just picks up one day and leaves home to adventure where he wants. His adventure leads him to the Dakotas to work and then on a kayak trip in the Gulf of Mexico and eventually to Alaska, where his life ends. In a way it is something I have always wanted to do, but have always been to scared to try. A story about someone who could put away the societal expectations placed on him and did what he wanted to do. Even though this book ends in tragedy I think a life was enjoyed to its fullest.

B00005A46U|4.0|Si bien el mundo del rock está lleno de etiquetas (a veces con definiciones y límites bastante dudosos) una de las más llamativas es la de la escena Canterbury, que agrupa a bandas con poco o nada en común musicalmente hablando, como es el caso de Caravan, Soft Machine, Egg o Gong por nombrar a los iniciadores. Caravan partió como exponente de la sicodelia pero ya en su segunda entrega se estableció como uno de los grupos más interesantes del rock progresivo, aunque una vez más el término se hace poco claro pensando en cosas similares como Yes, Genesis o Emerson. Eso puede ser lo mejor (o lo peor según donde se mire) de Caravan, el ser parte de un estilo sin abusar de él.<br />Iniciando el disco If I Could... parece no haber dejado la sicodelia atrás, pero el siguiente tema (And I Wish...) ya es otro asunto, la delicada voz y una pulcra instrumentación dan como resultado una hermosa y triste melodía, pero a continuación (As I Feel I Die) vuelve a aparecer el sonido progresivo y sicodélico, con un Dave Sinclair alucinante en el órgano. Hello Hello por su parte con su cuidada melodía es más accesible, un recordatorio de que también hay espacio para llegar a las grandes audiencias. El único momento de cierta monotonía lo aporta Can't Be Long... que con sus 14 minutos (atención progresivos) se torna un tanto tediosa, pero no consigue empañar un muy buen trabajo, ideal para quienes deseen nadar pero no bucear en las profundísimas aguas de lo progresivo.
0446608955|4.0|This is a sweet story of young love and the joys and pains that come with it. However this story about these two lovers was a little different. In the beginning, the girl was portrayed as a being a little awkward and somewhat aloof. However, when the girl's personality is revealed more and more--the narrator starts to fall in love with her.

B000067DNC|5.0|I love sci-fi that doesn't take itself too seriously.  This is exactly one of those shows.  Stargate pokes fun at itself while not having totally ludicris story lines.<br />I plan on purchasing the entire series on DVD so I can watch it any time I need a pick-me-up.  I highly recommend it!
0312263120|2.0|Not nearly as good as The Da Vinci Code or Angels and Demons.  It is very predictable and full of stock characters.  It's not terrible and you could certaintly do worse, but a disappointment after reading The Da Vinci Code.

B00007L4OM|4.0|I am a big fan of Jean Reno, so I guess that I am a bit biased. This is one fun movie, though even if you are not a fan of Reno. This is in part due to the writing credits of Luc Besson, a long-time collaborator of Reno's, famously teaming together for the brilliant Leon aka' The Professional, my all time favorite piece of cinema! While this movie doesn't have the depth and brilliant script of Leon, it is certainly a fine piece of work from both Besson and Reno. Adding to the wonderful spicy flavor of this dish, we have Ryoko Hirosue, who is an absolute gem as Hubert's surprise daughter, and Michael Muller, Hubert's longtime partner, who is hillarious when he takes a big scoop of wasabi and puts it in his mouth, the look on his face....priceless!! We should see more of him in domestic movies, he is quite a card! The cast plays off each other very well and the scene with Hubert's past love, lying in the coffin as Reno looks at her, is very touching and sweet. Bottom line, this is a sweet fun movie, plenty of action, humor and entertains divinely!! The movie also has a wonderful soundtrack, although it is not available here in the states, but definitely worth going to the trouble to get. I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a great fun movie and it will be definitely worth the time you spend to watch!!! Hai!
B00005JLSE|4.0|I just seen the Chicago DVD (Widescreen Edition) and though I would give the film on this DVD 5 stars (especially for having the DTS sound option along with Dolby Digital), I would give the \\"Special Features\\" section of this DVD only 3 stars because the \\"Special Features\\" section is poorly lacking compared to past Miramax DVDs like The Cider House Rules. Miramax could have included other extras such as the original theatrical trailer, all the TV spots (and there were many of them) plus all of the music videos (though the music video, \\"And All That Jazz\\" was shown at the end of the featurette, they could have also included the other 2 music videos, \\"Cell Block Tango (He Had It Comin')\\" from Queen Latifah and Lil' Kim featuring Macy Gray plus \\"Love is a Crime\\" from Anastacia). I assume that Miramax will add most if not all these features in a special collector's edition DVD in the future as part of their \\"Miramax Collector's Series\\" collection. Until then, enjoy watching Chicago on this DVD edition (as long as it's the widescreen version and not the \\"modified\\" fullscreen version).

B0000942HV|3.0|My wife, daughter and I listened very carefully to the original and this re-recording this weekend.  With the 2003 version, the sound engineering is much better, and all the instruments sound much more vivid.  Too much more vivid, as a matter of fact.  If you took all the sliders on a 10-channel graphic equalizer, and slid them all to the top, the orignal might sound somewhat like this.  The ominous, subtle bass-line of the original is so in-your-face that it actually obscures some of the other instruments.<br />Imagine a very complex paint-by-numbers of a masterpiece painting.  Everything very precise, all the colors exactly so.  Yet, the brush-strokes of the master painter wouldn't be there, and neither would delicate, moving blends of color.  Tubular Bells 2003 is exactly like that.  It sounds better technically, but the passion, vision and sublety are missing.  Our 10-year-old enjoys them both, but likes the first better because it &quot;puts pictures in my head, and the new one doesn't.&quot;  Smart kid.
B000002ACR|4.0|This album is recognized as a folk rock classic.  I don't know that I can add much to what has already been said about it.  One thing I have not seen anybody mention before is that there is an additional unlisted bonus track at the very end of the album.  It is an instrumental version of &quot;It Happens Each Day&quot;.
B00008OLYN|5.0|I had listened to songs like &quot;Deliverance&quot; and some other heavier metal songs by opeth. I bought the magazine BW &amp; BK and the song &quot;hope Leaves&quot; was on it. The song was outstanding when i read it was opeth i was stunned because it wasnt metal at all. So hearing that the band could conquer several genres of rock i knew i had to buy Damnation. I scanned the tracks for a crazy death metal song but i found nothing but songs resembling &quot;hope leaves&quot;. This was at first disapointing but now that i listen to the cd it is simply great. A band that has such a wide range of diverse sound and truly stunning talent only tells me that this is the future of metal.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|Let me tell you something, The Matrix Reloaded was a masterpiece of visual and intellectual stimulation.  All these people saying they didn't like the movie are obviously watching it for the wrong reasons.  The Matrix is not just an action movie to get cheap thrills out of, its much more than that.  The Matrix is about opening your mind to the possiblities that may be.  I can't wait for the DVD to come out, I'm sure its going to have some amazing extras for us interested in watching a movie that has a meaning.  Let's just hope all the people who said bad stuff about the Matrix are watching it to be enlightened, not just to see things blow up!
B00005JKZU|3.0|the movie is excellent for non-purists, but I agree with previous reviewers that the director added extra drama that is not needed, because the book supplies enough drama and excitement.  I think that if they followed the book more closely and did not make a major errors (elves helping Rohan (first born generally do not associate with the Edain); aragorn falling; ents being portrayed as dumb; faramir wanting the ring for gondor, the total opposite of the book) that the movie would be better to watch.  The book is dramatic and exciting enough with changing it for movies.  Hopefully this problem of not following the book will be rectified in return of the king.
B00005N9CV|5.0|This romantic classic should be in every one's collection of wonderfully composed love songs. It has such a mellow backdrop,to sit back relax and mesmerize.I trully love this cd, this is trully a classic for romance,it should be in everyone's collection,and  great for dancing partners too .It is slow,soothing,and so relaxing to listen to after a hectic day.  <BR>A must if you like mellow music.
B00005JKZV|2.0|the only reason i would buy this dvd is because of the preview for return of the king.<br />Hopefully this movie has inspired people to read the trilogy, as well as the Silmarillion and tolkien's lost tales.  Tolkien is a master storyteller and Peter Jackson can only do his best to tell the story faithfully by following the book as closely as possible.<br />This movie trilogy proves that reading the book is much better than the movie.
0385504209|5.0|This book hooks you from the first page!  This is a fast paced and action packed novel! The author successfully weaves fiction and non-fiction together to the point that the reader is unable to decipher fact from fiction!  I found the premise behind the book so interesting that I have begun researching these claims further!  Highly recommend this book!
B0000033TE|5.0|Brain Salad Surgery was an incredible album produced at the peak of ELP's creativity and perhaps what could also be considered the peak of the more symphonic episode of prog rock, 1973. Opening with the classic &quot;Jerusalem&quot;, the band shifs into high gear with their (very unique) interpretation of Ginastera's 1st Piano Concerto, 4th Movement (&quot;Tocatta&quot;) to land in the peaceful (and one of ELP's most beautiful songs) &quot;Still... You Turn Me On&quot;. After a ragtime-based &quot;Benny the Bouncer&quot;, the album finishes you up with the 29+ minute long &quot;Karn Evil 9&quot;, a 3-movement suite where the musicians bring out an extravaganza of showmanship. Lake showcases his vocals and exquisite bass/guitar, Emerson displays his skills at the Piano and Keyboards equally impressively, and Palmer is able to rock the house in the quick sections of the piece, and slow down to an almost stand still during the quieter parts.<br />Contrary to what you may think, and in spite of its sheer length (an entire side of the original vynil album) the album is not ONLY Karn Evil 9. The other pieces complement the suite in a way that is rather unique, since in most cases with similar prog rock bands, one-side pieces normally &quot;made&quot; the album where they appeared. As usual in their work, ELP are able to shift gears and shift styles in a way unique in music, playing equally well (and this production is a very good example of this) rock, ballads, ragtime and classic pieces. If you are new to ELP's music, I don't know if this would be an album I'd recommend to get you started (I'd probably go with 1972's Trilogy), but eventually you will HAVE to own it: you cannot escape one of prog rock's best productions.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Led Zeppelin delivers one power-house performance after another in this DVD covering '70-'79. The picture &amp; film quality are excellent - none of the trippy Song Remains the Same filler. The DVD captures Zeppelin at it's finest including an astounding peformance at the pinnacle of their career - Knebworth '79. It brings back good memories and an appreciation of the individual talents that came together to make the greatest rock band ever.
B00005OAIE|4.0|I have been listening to this album for a couple of days now. Up until I got it, I had only heard (ad nauseam) the very popular opening track, &quot;No Such Thing&quot;. Now, taking a few hard listens to the album, I can see where all buzz comes from. Indeed, John Mayer's voice sounds A LOT like Dave Matthews' and his music does resemble in more than one way David Gray's (remember &quot;Babylon&quot;), but Mayer does show that he's got something that needs to be respected.<br />His singing (though similar to DM) is very good, and his guitar-playing can be very heartfelt and intimate. However, I find him particularly interesting as a composer (both lyrics and music): like another reviewer, I loved &quot;Great Indoors&quot; (as an example). In sum, this is an album well worth paying attention to, as well as to his career. I am honestly glad that he didn't get stuck on this one album like so many one-album wonders in the past (Martin Page would be a good example).
B000002BYD|4.0|By 1998 Pearl Jam had dropped off from the public radar as &quot;the band&quot;. Grunge was dead and many detractors wrote Pearl Jam off as being dead. They prove on their 5th album that is far from the case. The entire band plays with a renewed energy and confidence knowing they don't have anything to prove to anyone. The lyrics are very personal delivered by Eddies' great voice. Stone and Mike play some great licks and obviously have fun trading off riffs. The rythmn section delivers yet again completing another great album from this great band.<br />1. Brain of J 9/10. Great song that gets things off to a rocking start.<br />2. Faithful 9/10. Midtempo rocker with nice lyrics and guitars.<br />3. No Way 7/10. Very unique sounding sonic landscape.<br />4. Given to Fly. 10/10 Downright amazing song! This is my favorite song in the entire Pearl Jam catalog. Great drums, lyrics, &amp; soaring guitars. Gives me chills to hear it.<br />5. Wishlist. 8/10 Simple acoustic song that sounds good.<br />6. Pilate 9/10. Many people don't like this song but I find it playful and well done.<br />7. Do the Evolution. 10/10 One of their most rocking, scathing songs.<br />8. Red Dot. 1/10 Short drum experiment that adds nothing.<br />9. MFC 8/10. Great guitar work makes this another solid song.<br />10. Lowlight 7/10. Good acoustic song.<br />11. In Hiding 8/10. Good song with good guitars.<br />12. Push Me Pull Me 1/10. Noisy experiment that doesn't work.<br />13. All Those Yesterdays 7/10. Sounds like a drinking song.<br />Overall Pearl Jam delivers a nice batch of rocking, thoughtful songs. It is nearly as good as any of their first 3 great albums. You can't go wrong with this great album.

B0000640S2|5.0|Only Sylvester Stallone, an Italian, has the acting skills to realistically portray the character John Rambo, a former special forces soldier of German and American Indian decent. The depth of this character only proves that Stallone is the greatest thesbian in the history of  American cinema. John Rambo's mission is to return to Vietnam and photograph former POW camps. Hundreds of thousands of G.I.s served in Vietnam, but John Rambo is the only one who knows this particular area. Hand selected by a top secret CIA project, Rambo goes in......<br />The deliberately slow knife sharpening scene, showing off buldging triceps and massive muscular definition, reflects the sentiment of American movie goers of 1985. America is strong, Reagan has a finger on the button, we will destroy Communism, and we want our movies filled with violence, as long as it is tastefully done and against America's enemies.<br />First Rambo's parachute doesn't open, then his contact is a woman, then he is abandoned by America after rescuing a living American POW, then he is tortured by Vietnamese and Russian officers. Only Rambo can save the day by destroying Vietnam with a bow and arrow, an obsolete helicopter, and an M-60 with a limitless amount of ammunition.<br />It's not the action that carries this film though, again remember it is the superb acting skills of Sly Stallone. He must have served in the military for fifty years to be able to single-handedly infiltrate a camp, fly a chopper, know every hand-held weapon known to man,  know the entire continent of Asia, and kill a battalion of Russian soldiers with a knife while hiding nude in a mudslide.<br />Where is the Rambo of the 21st Century? Has America turned into a nation of weaklings with no room or love for John J. Rambo? Save us Rambo, if only you could go to Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. The world can be safe, happy, and harmonious with the help of Rambo.
B0000028M7|5.0|From start to finish another classic A.I.C. CD,  I dig every track, Two thumbs up man...
B00005JMCR|5.0|This movie was awesome. after seeing the first two films the cast almost grows on you. you start to care about them and what happens to them in the movie. i personally thought american pie 2 was the best of the series but this is not far from it and maybe as good as the first film. it's different than the others seeing that they're all out of school and are set to start their lives. it was ok that some of the original cast was missing because there are a few new faces that were great in the movie. and anyways, why would vicky, and heather and them be at the wedding. did u ever see jim or michelle talk to any of them. and i dont think itd be a good idea to have nadia there. and oz not being there shows how true to life the movie is. people move on and grow apart. but enough about them, jim and michelle's whole family are there, kevin and finch are back and the milf guys are back and funny as always and even stiffler's mom is in it. stiffler is back and better than ever as he steals the whole show. stiffler was great in the movie. there's alot of side plots in the film that will have you laughing and of course stifler eats something he shouldn't have like the other two films. jyms dad catches jym at a bad time again and all the other jokes are new.
0316776963|5.0|David Sedaris is one of the funniest writers I've read in a long time. This was a great treat. The part about learning French had me rolling on the floor.

B00005JKHN|4.0|Courtesy of Amazon.com, I received Sleeping Beauty. At first, I was skeptical to watch. But I decided I would give it a go. What I found was a decent children's film. For kids, it will allow them to watch a fairy tale and dream of being a princess or prince. Parents will be pleased that there are no sex scenes, profanity, or any other common elements in films and TV today. For those reasons, parent and child alike will be charmed by Sleeping Beauty.

B000092ZYX|4.0|What to do after making two albums that shocked the world? If you're Radiohead, you just keep on diving headfirst into the great unknown. Hail to the Thief is not a radical departure from Kid A and Amnesiac but is by no means a straight continuation. Radiohead summed up the Kid A/Amnesiac period with the live album I Might Be Wrong, which was the end of an era.    This is the beginning of a new one. Radiohead have gone back to traditional instruments for the majority of the record, but this is not a return to The Bends. A couple of Amnesiac songs hinted at this; these go further. It is apparent from the jangling guitar intro of the opening \\"2+2=5\\" -- a reference, as several parts of the album are, to George Orwell's masterwork 1984 -- that Radiohead is, partly at least, taking another stab at what they're best at: being today's best guitar band. Here, their trademark vibe is back in near-full effect, purveying the rich goldmine that bands like Coldplay have picked up on to great success. Some of the other more conventional tracks include \\"Sit Down. Stand Up,\\" \\"There There,\\" and \\"Scatterbrain.\\" Also among them is \\"A Punchup at a Wedding,\\" one of the band's most melodic songs and one of their greatest. Several cuts are piano-driven -- a real treat for those who, like me, have long loved Thom Yorke's playing. His excellent ivory-tickling on songs such as the breathtakingly beautiful \\"Sail to the Moon\\" and the moody \\"Punchup\\" show how much he has improved and how much of an asset it is to the band's sound. His playing ranges from beautiful to spooky to eerily mysterious. It works especially well in tandem with guitar -- and, though none of the guitar/piano combinations reach the majesty of \\"Karma Police,\\" several come damn close.    However, as one would expect from Radiohead, especially in light of the last two releases, things are soon shaken up considerably. Certainly, electronics are far less prominent, and the techno influence is significantly less pronounced, butboth are still present in a different form -- and both Yorke and Johnny Greenwood are credited for \\"laptops.\\" Several songs -- \\"Backdrifts,\\" \\"The Gloaming\\" -- are nearly as wildly experimental as anything on Kid A in their own way. Also, some of the more traditional songs have experimental sections that often spring on the listener unexpectedly, inciting a unique jolt effect that keeps us attentive and rewards an active ear. Songs with such elements include \\"2+2=5,\\" \\"Sit Down. Stand Up,\\" and \\"We Suck Young Blood\\"; several of these also have a chanting outro that produces something of a hypnotic effect and has an almost prayer-like -- or, more accurately, plea-like -- quality.     Last but not least, at least two songs are totally new ventures and great ones at that. \\"Myxomatosis\\" is a startling shuffle that is hard to describe. It cannot be merely listened to; it simply has to be experienced. This remarkable track plays like one man's descent into madness. The lyrics, perfectly nuanced with Yorke's very suitable vocal in tandem with the schizophrenic music, create the effect. It is am amazing tune. Equally interesting is \\"A Wolf at the Door,\\" the closing track. A paranoiac lyric is rapped -- yes -- over an insistent, piano-led groove only to explode all at once into a beautiful, haunted chorus. This astonishing track is the perfect end to a remarkable work.    Yorke's lyrics have also stepped up in quality from the last two albums, where they were mostly a hodgepodge. They are the most integral since The Bends. As the title indicates, they tend to be somewhat political -- but don't expect Yorke to get very specific. One would think otherwise when the very first lines shine through as clearly possible -- \\"Are you such a dreamer? To put the world to rights?\\" -- and are clearly-enunciated at that. As previously mentioned, it echoes 1984 -- but instead of warning against the possible emergence of a 1984-esque world, Yorke seems to be singing from the perspective of onewho already inhabits such a world -- nay, positively revels in it. The lyrics get less specific as the album winds along, but a general feeling of paranoia, mistrust, and fear pervades. One gets the feeling that Big Brother is indeed watching -- that there is always A Wolf at the Door. Radiohead manages to invoke, without getting specific as Bruce Springsteen did, all of the confusion, disorder, chaos, uncertainty, fear, and angst of a post-2000 election, post-9/11 world.    Unlike OK Computer and Kid A, and like The Bends and Amnesiac, Hail to the Thief plays and feels like a collection of songs rather than a harmonious whole. That said, it still conveys itself best in sequence; the running order is still important, and the first and last tracks, in particular, are integral to the cumulative effect. The songs throughout are almost uniformly very good, though some -- \\"I Will,\\" for instance -- are of somewhat lesser quality. Like every Radiohead release, it grows on you. Give it time, and let its greatness unravel. I rank this ahead of Kid A -- which I thought was excellent -- and under OK Computer. This is the record of the year so far.
B00005JM1Y|3.0|Summary:<BR>Johnny English (Rowan Atkinson) is a novice member of MI-5, the British top secret intelligence service.  When projects under Johnny's responsibility result in the deaths of all of the real MI-5 agents, MI-5 has no choice but to turn to Johnny English as their new top agent.  <br />With his trusty sidekick, Bough (Ben Miller (II)), and a new found acquaintance/American spy, Lorna Campbell (Natalie Imbruglia), Johnny happens upon a plot by Pascal Sauvage (John Malkovich) to become King of England and then turn his new kingdom into one giant prison (because he's French and he really doesn't like the British).<br />Johnny continuously bumbles his way, in a very much Mr. Magoo like fashion, through all of the plots and twists, amazingly staying alive (of course, Bough and Lorna do most of the work) and even gets himself crowned King in the end.<br />My Comments:<BR>This movie isn't anything particularly groundbreaking, but it is still pretty funny.<br />The story, a plot to turn England into a giant prison by a villain who also wants to become King is, actually, new.  It isn't very interesting, but it is new.  I don't think I've ever heard of anyone proposing that before.  As for the villain's plans being ruined by a bumbling secret agent, that isn't new.  So, despite coming up with a new, though completely uninteresting, plan for conquering the world, the movie resorts to a pretty traditional plot device - secret agents.<br />There are also a few points in the storyline that aren't all that clear and the movie has a tendency to jump around quite a bit - from location to location without the connections to them being set up before hand (like arriving at Pascal's castle out of the blue).  But the problems aren't big enough to be distracting.<br />As for the acting, it actually was pretty good.  I'm still amazed at how much Rowan Atkinson can do with his face.  His ability to display so many expressions so clearly is absolutely astounding.  As for the rest ofthe cast, they were good supporting cast members, but that was about it.  John Malkovich was a decent French villain, though whether or not his accent was any good I don't know because I'm not really qualified to recognize a good French accent when I hear one.  I don't remember Natalie Imbruglia as being a stand out supporting actress, but then again, most of the female actresses in movies like this are in it for their looks and not their acting ability.  I don't remember her being horrible, either though, so she must not have been too bad.<br />Overall, I really enjoyed this movie.  It is British humor, which probably isn't funny to everyone.  And, a lot of the humor is pretty silly humor (there's even some literal potty humor), but I couldn't help from laughing.  If you've seen Rowan Atkinson as Mr. Bean and like his work, you'll probably really enjoy this film.  If not, this might be a good movie with which to start, even for non British humor lovers.  I recommend this film.
B000089RVX|2.0|I must say that I was hoping for more when I bought this cd. The whole album sounds more or less exactly like the song \\"Bring me to life\\" and in the long run it all becomes rather boring. Personally, I'd prefer a more melodic approach. In small doses, Evanescence is alright but the album feels like one long song instead of 11 separate tunes, much because of the way Amy Lee is structuring the vocal parts. And I'm sure this album will be regarded as very time typical in a couple of years. To me, Evanescence sounds like a nicer Skunk Anansie with a touch of Audioslave as well as The Calling. For depressed goth rockers wearing black this album might be a treat. Ten bucks says this band will be forgotten after the second album.
B00009L1TA|3.0|Summary:<BR>Hardy (John Travolta) is an ex-Ranger posing as a DEA agent in Panama.  When a training mission supposedly runs amuck, his old friend who is now in charge of the military base, Styles (Timothy Daly), ask him if he can come help sort things out.<br />Arriving at the base, Hardy meets Osborne (Connie Nielsen (I)) who is either an attorney or an investigator that has been assigned to the case.  Hardy immediately begins using some unconventional methods to get information out of soldiers involved, but the two soldiers that made it back to camp after the mission are mixing lies with truths.  Dunbar (Brian Van Holt) is the one soldier who made it out physically unharmed, but he doesn't want to talk. Kendall (Giovanni Ribisi) was shot in the leg but seems to have a number of other psychological problems that he is dealing with as well.<br />As it turns out, the problems with the mission revolved around a drug operation that was being controlled by someone on the base.  As Hardy and Osborne delve deeper, they find out that another of Hardy's old friends and Osborne's former lover, Vilmer (Harry Connick Jr.), was involved. <br />Once they think they've gotten the story straight Hardy leaves only to be followed by Osborne who is still suspicious.  And, kind of rightfully so because Hardy ends in the company of Dunbar and most of the rest of the missing soldiers.  As it turns out, Hardy belongs to a secret group, Section 8, that was set up for these kinds of missions - to bring down drug traffickers.  <br />My Comments:<BR>When you really start thinking about the movie you realize that it doesn't make much sense.  Why would Section 8, led by Hardy, go to all this trouble just to bring down a drug operation when they already seemed to know everything that was going on?  The story superficially seems to be pretty cool and I have to admit I liked the twist at the end that Hardy and the others were actually good guys and not bad guys, but it doesn't actually make any sense.  What's more, the director employs a number of tricks to throw you off the track, including a number of sequences playing out the lies that were told by Dunbar and Kendall, but they are actually just lies and don't reveal what really happened.  Strangely, when the movie ends you realize that you don't ever know exactly what happened, you just kind of think you do, but it's never fully revealed.<br />As for the acting, I thought it was decent.  John Travolta was pretty good in this role.  He's actually a fairly versatile actor and I like watching him.  Samuel L. Jackson, who plays the character of West in this, was also good, but that is because he can only play violent characters well.  Connie Nielsen was also pretty good, but her performance sadly paled in comparison to Travolta's, even though he isn't going to win an Oscar for it.  The rest of the cast was okay, but for the most part pretty trivial.  Giovanni Ribisi played a convincing drug addict, homosexual soldier and Harry Connick Jr. wasn't bad either, but those are really the only other people worth mentioning.<br />Overall, if you can look past the fundamentally flawed story and just try to enjoy the movie at a superficial level you'll probably like it.  If you can't let the problems with the story go, then you definitely won't enjoy this movie.  I liked it because of the twist at the end, but I probably should have seen it coming.  Anyway, I'd recommend it, but not very highly.
0670824399|4.0|As a child,i have always enjoy reading books written by Roald Dahl,Christopher Pike... This is no exception.I first read Matilda when I was ten.That was in 2000.I think it is indeed very humourous,and though Mr Dahl did exaggerate the story plot a little bit,I think it is one of the best book ever written by him.<br />When two real irritating and hard-hearted people got married,what do you expect? Mr and Mrs Wormwood owned a car business(it was an illegal one,where they stole cars,then polished and revamped them before selling them to innocent buyers),they had two children,a boy named Michael a girl named Matilda.Usually,or should I say,all parents wished to have a gifted child.But the Wormwoods were exceptions.They think that their television programmes are more important than their kids' education.They don't encouraged reading,in fact,they think reading is a real freaking stuff to do.Matilda likes reading,she detests watching television...and that was how her parents came to think their daughter is a nuisance.They'd neglect her,treat her as though they'd no daughter,but just a son.In fact,they even sent her to school at a later age,when most kids are already at.<br />But Matilda is smart.She is quick-witted,intelligent and sensible for a girl of five or six.She reads great books written by good and famous writers in bombasic languages,she knew difficult mathematics and she created havoc(not really for her parents deserved them)like putting super glue onto her daddy's hat.<br />When she goes to school,she meets the nice,kind-hearted Ms Honey who seems to share a bond with Matilda.She also meets the tyrant of the school,feared not only by the students but also the teachers.She is Ms Trunchbull,who,coincidentally,is Ms Honey's bad,bad aunt.At the same time,Matilda realises she has extaodinary powers,and she's really good at them.And she uses them to deal with the bad,bad Trunchbull woman.<br />I've watched the film,and I think this is indeed a very good book.The language is simple and for people who really don't like reading,I can assure you,this is the book where Matilda,the Wormwoods,Ms Honey and the Trunchbull woman will all come alive and capture your imagination.Trust me.You will enjoy this book.<br />And I mean it.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Buying this title was one of the best decisions I ever made.  All the songs transpire a fresh atittude and everyone at home seems to love the song &quot;Your body is a wonderland&quot;  I play it outloud in my study and my kids keep asking me to play it back!.  Looking forward to whatever else he hands out.
B0000A1RJI|4.0|this is a good score-- it works well with the film on literal and abstract levels.<BR>there's a lot of mickey-mousing, but to be expected.  quite the european feel-- a waltzing ship to be sure.<br />klaus is developing a voice, with a little help from dear hans, but i still wonder what the silvestri score was like.
B00004Y6OA|4.0|The BEST part of this album is that Dave doesn't do his patented screaming. It actually PROVES he was an excellent singer and didn't have to rely on screams and little filler noises! Eddie Van Halen also shines on this album showing us some NEW stuff on the guitar. I highly recommend this too anyone,even if you don't like VH,give this a listen!
B000000WA4|5.0|I have to admit that I didn't expected this album to be as good as it showed. Although I'm not the greatest fan of Smashing Pumpkings (Some small, unknown bands are more in need of support than a international , platinium album winner band) the quality of the tracks and the care for the music is transparent in this album.<BR>As some people here said, even just a few tracks are worth the entire album, but in my small knowledge of music, every track is worth in the means of original, experimental sound.<BR>Alternating between a almost hard core and melancolic songs, this album maintains a rhytm not normally seen in most works on the market. Each track was carefully positioned inside the album and that makes a big difference in the final product. It can make the difference between a hit record and an amateur work.<BR>In resume, as many people here, I think this album is more than worth while. In fact, is one of the best works in the music I've seen.<BR>So, people who like different music, I'm sure you'll not regret buying this album, even if you're not a gigantic fan of the band itself.
B00000JPHD|4.0|I remember viewing this when I was a child and as an adult. I always felt the power of the movie rests with the silence of the scenes. This version with the awful, corny music by Philip Glass ruins the whole atmosphere and acting. I am sending this crummy video back and not because it is too old in terms of the special effects we see in many of the modern movies. It's that horrible accompanying music. I have never, ever returned any item ordered from Amazon.com but this will be the first. I do not even have the receipt because I thought I would be viewing the film as it was when I was a child. Amazon.com, you can keep my money. I only hope I can find this version of Dracula minus that dopey Philip Glass \\"music.\\" I certainly will try to find the original version without that [bad] music. It's horrible. If anyone out there knows of one, please let me know.
B000089RVX|2.0|This cd is good, im not going to deny that, its not great, but it is a decent piece of work compared to most of the other bands releasing lately. However, if you have ever heard of a band called Lacuna Coil you would notice a very close similarity. The only problem with evanescence is that they lack the spark that Lacuna coil has, as well as the fact that Amy Lee's voice isnt as good and the vocal harmonies of Lacuna are far better. Lacuna's riffs and songs are darker and more emotional and Cristina's voice covers more range. I would recommend Lacuna Coil anyday before this band (pick up comalies), the original is always better then the clones!
B00005UEAR|5.0|I have about every major Dream Theater album except 'Once in a Livetime' and have seen them in concert once so far.  At first, this album did not appeal to me, until I actually listened to some of the songs.  This album is totally great.  On the first disc, The Glass Prison, Blind Faith, and Misunderstood are totally great.  The 4th song is kinda cliche, but the 5th song is alright.  The second disc, the whole song 'Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence' is divided into 8 parts, and all of them are great in their own way.  At the concert I went to, they opened with 'The Glass Prison', that was a month ago and im still hooked on that song.  This album was good, and I'm hoping their next album will be just as good or even better.
B000089RVX|1.0|This band is nothing more then a dumbed down linkin park version of Lacuna Coil, picks lacuna's album comalies and see what real goth rock is.
B000062Y98|5.0|This was my first Blind Guardian album I really got into.  &quot;And Then There Was Silence&quot; was the first song of theirs I heard, and I started liking them right then.  Other songs on this album I liked include Under the Ice, The Soulforged, The Maiden and Minstrel Night, Battlefield, and Precious Jerusalem.  The rest of the songs on here are still very good, and I still like listening to them.  Overall, this cd is one of Blind Guardian's best, and is worth getting, just like all their other cds are.

B000021XS0|5.0|This was my first Dream Theater album I got into, as with many (the first album i bought was When Dream and Day Unite).  I was totally blown away with the instrumental part of Fatal Tragedy, and that started a huge Dream Theater binge in me that will hopefully never end.  I don't get why people will rate this below a 5, granted this is all opinion.  The album was totally great, they showed off, as usual, but still kept their own sound and made it tasteful.  The lyrics in many of the songs were totally great, and the style of them could never be better.  The songs on this can appeal to people of all genres, metalheads or no.  Dream Theater totally rules, and everyone at least acknowledges that.
B00005J6SZ|5.0|NOTHING on &quot;Like A Virgin&quot; is weak from the elctronic<BR>burbling of the tital song and the ammusing pop of &quot;Material Girl&quot; but it is on tracks like &quot;Dress You Up&quot; and the dance<BR>classic &quot;Angel&quot;-non-hit tracks that earned radio airplay that<BR>solidified &quot;Like A Virgin&quot;'s good reputation.A Fine companion to<BR>her debut album only more dynamic.
B000056TKC|5.0|Ferenc Fricsay's performance of Beethoven's 9th Symphony (and Egmont Overture) with the Berlin Philharmonic has to be counted among the greatest versions ever recorded.  Reissued on CD in the DG Originals series (don't confuse it with Karajan's 9th featuring a remarkably similar cover), this was the first version of the 9th to appear in stereo back in 1958, and it was Deutsche Grammophon's first ever stereo recording with the Berlin Philharmonic.  It was a landmark event to be sure, and who better to entrust it with than Fricsay, a colossal figure in his day.  Had he not died tragically young at age 48 in 1963, Fricsay would surely be mentioned today in the same company as Karajan and Bernstein.  But Fricsay is presently getting his due as two recent reissues attest -- his \\"Great Conductors of the Century\\" collection won a Grammophone Award prompting DG to release a 9-CD box set of his recordings in their \\"Original Masters\\" series (see my reviews for both titles).  Anyway, this glowing account of the 9th is a great place to begin with Fricsay, then be prepared to want more by this brilliant conductor.

B0000584V3|5.0|Opeth seems to be the most critically acclaimed band in death metal, and with good reason, as their ability to range from crushing death to moving clean vocals while remaining melodic throughout is unparalleled.  I am not generally a death metal fan -- I find most of it abrasive and annoying.  The production on BWP is very tight and the famed Opeth &quot;wall of sound&quot; will envelop the listener, drawing him or her into a dark, yet touching realm that only Opeth can create. <br />In more concrete terms, the riffs are great throughout.  The general pace of the album changes from moderately fast ) to slow, but, unlike on some of their other earlier albums, the slower acoustic passages do not wander -- they keep the listener interested.  The death vocals are above average, and have improved from earlier efforts by the band.  The clean vocals are GREAT, and when combined with some great atmospheric sound, are quite moving.  Best tracks are probably The Leper Affinity, Bleak, The Drapery Falls, and the title track.  That being said, all tracks are quite good, though the two acoustic songs, Harvest and Patterns in the Ivy, are nothing to write home about.  The album is best when played in its entirety.  If you find yourself disappointed by the nu-metal scene and are looking for metal that can truly evoke sadness and anger while sustaining a beautiful melody, don't pass up this chance.  One of my top 10 albums of all time.
B00005J6T1|5.0|Why is Madonna's self-titaled debut so wonderful?Because<BR>it daringly explores every trend in dance-pop of this era from the carefully crafted hits &quot;Holiday&quot; and &quot;Lucky Star&quot;,the spiky<BR>electro-funk of her debut 1982 single &quot;Everybody&quot; and &quot;I Think Of You&quot;,the new wave of &quot;Burning Up and the shimmering <BR>pop of &quot;Borderline&quot;.What more can one say-this album influenced a  whole generation and despite their best efforts most contemporary artists in this vein can't come close to it's fervor.The extended mixes of it's hits added here only serve to remind us of that fact-staggering!
B000009PNY|4.0|I used to be quite the DM fan, and have heard many tributes to them, and I can say with no doubt that this is my favorite.  However, most other DM tributes were pretty awful to me, so how does this stack up?  <br />Best songs:<BR>Failure: Enjoy the Silence.  It rocks, simple as that.  Takes on a heavier feel than the original which works quite well.  <BR>God Lives Underwater: Fly on the Windscreen.  GLU makes no secret about their love of DM, and this song is certainly an excellent take on one of my favorite DM tunes.  Funky throughout without losing the darkness of the original.<BR>Rammsein: Stripped.  I am not sure if I like this so much because it induces headbanging at a DM song or because the German accent is just so funny!  It is a great hard industrial tune that induces laughter nearly every time with the unintentionally funny vocals.  I wonder if David Hasselhoff brought a similar funny accent to Germany when he was a pop sensation there.<br />Good<BR>Cure: World in My Eyes.  Enjoyable.  Cool atmospherics throughout adds some ambience on top of a solid beat (lots of bass), which helps considering that the main keyboard riff is a little weak.<BR>Locust: Master and Servant.  A lounge cover of a DM staple. I like it and if you like loung music, you will like it as well.  If you don't like lounge, you will not like it.<BR>Deftones: To Have and To Hold.  I like it. It rocks throughout with more spoken than sung (or screamed) vox.  Less heavy than your average Deftones tune, but it works.<BR>Dishwalla: Policy of Truth.  A great bass line is the best part of this track.  Vocals are mostly drab, but it is just kind of interesting to hear this DM classic set to a rock beat.<br />OK<BR>Meat Beat Mainfesto: Everything Counts.  Hard to cover this classic, but done with a catchy beat by MBM.  I don't like his voice too much and the way the song is sung is a little annoying to me, but the music largely overcomes the shortcomings of the vocals.  Gets repetitive at times.<BR>Gus Gus: Monument. Interesting and sometimes ambient with a few different beats mixed in.  The sound can be a little busy at times.<BR>Smashing Pumpkins: Never Let Me Down Again.  It's an ok cover, but it just seems uninspired, but, then again, so did (in my opinion) most Pumpkins material after the Siamese Dream album.  <BR>Tolerable<BR>Monster Magnet: Black Celebration. This isn't the power-rocking Magnet you are expecting, which I found immensely disappointing, since Magnet has been known to rock crazily.  Sort of a strange techno piece with interesting vocals, but coulda been much better.<br />Bad<BR>Veruca Salt: Somebody.  Whew, someone open a window.  This overly serious cover serves only to make Martin Gore seem to be the best vocalist on the planet in comparison.  BAAAD singing.<BR>Hooverphonic: Shake the Disease.  Dry and boring.  The background synth doesn't seem to match the song.  <BR>Self: Shame. Sorta like a wannabe Beck. Not familiar with this band, nor will I become familiar with them after this.  Too much noise, not enough of anything remotely musical.<BR>Rabbit in the Moon: Waiting for the Night.  I don't like too-busy drum machine, which overrides a decent sounding voice.  If you like more of a dancey style, this may be for you.<BR>Apollo 44: I Feel You.  Gahan carries this track much better than the Apollo 44 frontman.  A more powerful singer would've created a better track.  The music throws in some thick keyboards but doesn't deviate too much from the original.
B00008H2LB|3.0|man this rocks you dont know rock like these guys. not as good as their other great albums or even the newish dixie chicks(fave on my turntable, permanent fixture) You don't have taste if you don't like the best most original blend of rap/metal with an edge blended especially for the smarter kids who can understand the brilliant mathematical genius of 5/4/ time and its tailor made for radio sound not unlike other rap metal blends of say, oh, 20,000 other rap metal bands. All good ones of course. I like EMO too!!!!!
B00005MP58|5.0|This was an amazing movie!  I could not help but sit and watch all of it in anticipation of what would happen next!  Cannot say enough wonderful things about this movie.

B00008YLV2|5.0|Josh Hartnett, Eric Bana and Ewan McGregor are under heavy fire in the astounding war drama \\"Black Hawk Down\\". In 1993, a group of peace-keeping American soldiers are sent to the hostile Somalian capital of Mogadishu to capture a ruthless warlord. When the mission goes terribly wrong, the men find themselves outnumbered by thousands of Somalian militia and fighting for their lives. Based on the best-selling true story, \\"Black Hawk Down\\" is a powerful action-packed masterpiece of American filmmaking. Director Ridley Scott (Gladiator & Alien) has captured the fury and carnage of war with such stunning suspense, emotional drama and realistic detail. This amazing movie contains a compelling story and spectacular action sequences. Josh Hartnett, Ewan McGreggor, Eric Bana and Tom Sizemore deliver some good performances. The talented cast also includes William Fichtner, Orlando Bloom, Jason Isaacs, Jeremy Piven and Sam Shepard. \\"Black Hawk Down\\" had its share of controversy but recieved some largely positive reviews and two Academy Awards.<br /><br />Get ready to experience director Ridley Scott's exceptional war spectacle with \\"Black Hawk Down\\" 3-Disc Deluxe Edition. Like its previous release, this powerful action-packed film is presented in 2.40:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The DVD contains an extraordinarily flawless picture quality with stunning detail and great sharpness. The Dolby Digital 5.1 sound is definitely engaging with dynamic surround effects, but a DTS audio track should have been included in this edition. This stunning 3-Disc edition features audio commentaries by filmmakers and Task Force Ranger veterans, behind-the-scenes featurettes, deleted scenes, in-depth historical look in the events in Mogadishu and theatrical trailers. With an impressive DVD presentation and amazing supplements, \\"Black Hawk Down\\" is a must-have addition to any DVD collection and certainly scores an \\"A\\".
0553269631|5.0|This book was amazing in conveying the emotions of despair and loneliness. The message sent by the novel is that there is no true answer to our problems - we may think we almost have it, and then everything can be quickly shattered. What I found most interesting about the novel was the fact that Blount (the drunk), would always say, &quot;we need for the people to KNOW, and once they KNOW, then the lie can be exposed.&quot; It is this knowledge that McCullers nourishes the reader with. A deeply moving story with an important message.
B00005JLU1|4.0|I just saw this movie yesterday on TV- I won't lie, the only reason I watched it was because I saw Johnny Depp in the opening credits, but soon I forgot my fangirlish obsession because the movie was so funny! (Ok, thats a flat out untruth, one of the biggest reasons the movie was so good was Johnny Depp, but still)It was a satire off of Grease-like movies, and it had me laughing hysterically. I completely adored the Cry-Baby song he first sang, it was awesome. I can't wait for the DVD to come out- I am sure it will be excellent.
B00005JKJA|1.0|We all know that David Lynch's movie creations are on the weird side, hard to follow sometimes, bizarre.  The very best part of this film is Ann Miller.  She plays the nice manager of a Hollywood apartment building.  Ann Miller is a very talented and respectable actress.  I can understand her taking this role, but I can also understand her not discussing any other part of this film she was not involved in.  She doesn't have to.  I hope she will get a better film or tv project out of this.  I so liked her guest spot in the ABC tv series \\"Home Improvement\\".  I also recall a Tom Snyder radio show interview she did many years ago that has never left my mind.  Ann Miller is a sweet one of a kind lady.  The last 48 minutes of this film is terrible.  It just drops flat.  But if you are a fan of David Lynch films, don't let me stop you.  This DVD does not contain a chapter selection.  It won't even let you skip to another scene.  The screen goes black and goes into \\"Bonus Material\\", so you have to go \\"Main\\" and play the movie all the way through again.  I guess David Lynch wants to make you watch this film all the way through from start to finish.  Special appearances by Lee Grant, Billy Ray Cyrus, Chad Everett and James Karen.  Instead of watching this Lynch junk film, watch another Ann Miller film instead.  A happy Ann Miller musical would do just fine.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Amazingly great cd.  Filled with suprises and uplifting songs.  Anyone that enjoys John Mayer type music should get this cd.  With that said however Gavin Degraw is not a mayer copy.  His music is unique and very well crafted.  He is like a mix of stevie wonder, billy joel, and blessed union of saints.  I am so happy i found him.  If the rest of the world does he will stop nothing short of utter greatness.  I recommend this cd to anyone and everyone who enjoys good music.  Gavin: keep up the honest sincere music I have grown to love!
B00005JLRT|4.0|You could say Nemesis is a not-well-thought parody of ST2, and you could be possibly right, but the analogy serves for the moment, so I'll try to explain my feelings about this movie in that way. It begins with a remainder of our own temporal status in the universe: the Riker/Troi wedding is an exquisite way to tell us about family, friends and continuity. Just like in Khan Movie, Kirk's birthday reminds him about time and his friends remind him about family. That's a good and laughable moment (especially with Data's performance). and it is possible wedding... Worf married Troi in an ALTERNATE future, remember? Next, we encounter the nemesis element (ironic, but Khan's movie was about a \\"Genesis\\" project in the hands of a Nemesis character...) a weak plot? Don't think so. Picard is the captain of the most powerful starship of the fleet, the \\"flagship\\" of the Federation; it's the best target if you want a conspiracy. Changing and Admiral or a desk officer doesn't allow a swift attack on a colony for example... (None of this is on the movie of course... a shame...) Well, a clone is made... and marooned on the Remus planet (never heard of it? Think... the Rome founders: Romulus and...). Although no one explains more about this Shinzon (the clone), and why is he kept alive if he is of no more use, we need him alive! It's the reason of the movie! (C'mon folks...be a little flexible...) and he allows you to think many things: first of all, a person is a very complex thing, with multiple facets. You could create a \\"nemesis\\" with any of these aspects of the same character. I think Picard had many \\"nemesis\\" (just like Bond, Superman or any hero you could imagine...) and the best of them is, of course \\"Q\\" but... second thing: even twins are different in personality, desires and goals. Culture, environment and education mark a person for life, and this is not the first time you see an evil counterpart in Star trek (remember the mirror universe?) so... third thing: what if youhave another life, totally the opposite? Could you blame yourself for your own acts? And going back to Khan's:  remember he was genetically created... Anyway, Picard's mind go through radical emotions: anger, compassion, and even paternal affection I think, all about Shinzon. In a certain key moment Picard freezes in front of Shinzon and you think \\"this is it, they're all gonna die\\" because this \\"I can't blame him for being evil\\" thing. <br />All in all, you need any subplot to make the end. (Or may be not everyone... for example the pre warp people in the sand planet watching \\"aliens\\": bye bye prime directive...) B-4, Data's dumb brother is an expendable character... but you see it's necessary, he can be funny reminding us of the old first season lieutenant commander positronic-brained-terahertz-powered-incapable-of-whistling android... and for other things... I regret deeply he wasn't a little bit smarter in the end... Finally, you have a ship battle sequence like no one in the trek saga of movies. In its time, Star trek 2 was the same thing, and of course you face a no-win scenario, with a sacrifice... and that's all I will say about it (like Gump says...)<BR>My final opinion: Well, I have both movies: I prefer Khan's because of Montalban's performance: simply majestic! Khan is able to transmit you his wrath... Shinzon can't. You could even think he can be turned to the \\"light side of the force\\" for moments... (forgive me trekkies for I have sinned...) it's not a bad guy... just... uninformed (Xavier's words...)<BR>But for the DVD version: this is the best made of the next generation movies: it has extra footage, an alternate ending (excellent but incompatible with the final cut) and documentaries. If you ask me about the best trek movie, I'd say Star trek 2, and if you think of an equivalent for it in next gen, this is your choice. But please, don't forget \\"First Contact\\", the second place of the saga. Nemesis is a movie for thiking fans, those who can read between the lines and say: \\"the story is good, its way to be told is a little irrelevant. it's a fine good bye for Picard's saga... But, if someone of trek writers read these: please make more movies!
B000089RVX|5.0|I have heard on and off about being a Christian or not being a Christian band. They said at one time on the old website that they were but of course, you use that ill-fated word \\"Christian\\" and everyone wants to snowball you. I think about Christ's crucifixion and I feel pain, sorrow, anger and hopelessness.<BR>So what is so different about what Evanescence is singing about?!? If they are Christian, kewl, if they are not, kewl.<BR>Can we get off the subject on what Christian music is supposed to sound like?!!!??? Obviously, some of you have not heard of \\"Saviour Machine\\" whose lyrics can scare the living **** out of you if you don't know Jesus...Christian music does not have to be soft to get the point across and I for one aint no head bowed down pushover Christian...I prefer my music hard and prefer to slay demons. Rock on, Evanescence! The whole album is perfect to listen to when this world has put too much crap on you and you just want to be left alone or with those who can truly understand...in a dark, candlelit room, rain optional.<BR>If anyone knows about Saviour Machine...talk to me!!!
B0000640SA|5.0|This movie is rather low-key, subtle almost. It took a few minutes to &quot;get it&quot; but when I did, and grew comfortable with the pattern, it was a good watch. You are both intrigued and saddened at the plight of the poor guy whose short term memory is REALLY short term.<br />The backwards plot is, of course, the outstanding feature but if the acting, dialogue and plot were not excellent, that fabulous plot would have been for naught. We've all seen moview, read books, viewed television shows that had intriguing stories only to lose interest when other elements were not up to par. This movie avoided that dilemma with a catchy dialogue, good actors and an even, arching direction that brought the entire story into focus. Rent the DVD and enjoy --This text refers to the DVD edition.

B00006JKON|1.0|Here is a revealing bit from an amateur (amazon.com) review of another Jethro Tull record:<br />\\"The instinct of the Jethro Tull fan, of whom I am one, is to nurture the band and protect it from pejorative comment. Particularly as unbelievers already abound, without our adding to their momentum through unfavourable reviews on Amazon.\\"<br />Another revealing bit from an interview with Ian Anderson in the Las Vegas Sun, May 2002 (the full text of the interview can be found at the Jethro Tull web site):<br />\\"We have our faithful. They're great people, although a little bit crazy. They're the kind of Tull fans who will buy anything.\\" <br />If you, yourself, are not among these \\"faithful\\" who consider, as an article of faith--blind, unreasoning, uncritical faith-that what bears the imprint \\"Jethro Tull\\" is necessarily sacred, you will want to take the five-star reviews here cum grano salis, with a grain of salt (or perhaps an entire shaker or two).
B00005JMD3|4.0|Let me first say that this is the first movie since--was it \\"Unfaithful\\"?--to get me out of the house and into an actual movie theater. That says a lot right there. Now let me say that my wife is a cop and so are some of my friends. I'm ex-military and I have some weapons training, so I went into this movie expecting to be underwhelmed (and not a little upset) by the weapons handling. But I have to say, I was most impressed. Safe handling abounded, and the only careless act I saw was LL Cool J with his finger casually on the trigger of his shotgun at the wrong time. That's pretty impressive, and it's likely because real LAPD vets like Steve Gomez (the guy in shorts at the North Hollywood gig) and Scott Reitz (trainer extraordinaire) did the training. So on top of everything else, \\"S.W.A.T.\\" has that going for it.<br />As far as the movie itself goes, it's serviceable--and amazingly restrained. I can imagine what kind of explosion-fest it would have been had Rob Cohen or Michael Bay directed it, and I'm glad they didn't. The plot is nothing new, but it's fairly solid. The story centers more around the team and its training, and less on the \\"get the bad guy\\" aspect, which was fine with me. Refreshing, even. I was a huge fan of the TV series back in the day, but I didn't expect any more connection to the series than the concept and the names. So of course the cameos by Steve Forrest and Rod Perry were a nice surprise.<br />The cast is good, good-looking, and comfortable in their roles. There's plenty here for everyone: action for the guys; hot guys for the girls. I thought I'd be tired of Colin Farrell by now, but surprisingly I'm not. His banter with Samuel L. Jackson was natural and convincing. And who can get enough of Michelle Rodgiguez kicking butt as usual? \\"S.W.A.T.\\" is the popcorn movie of the summer...fall...and beyond. Can I reserve the DVD yet?
B0000640VO|5.0|This is one of the best movies that I have watched. A classic comedy that portrays everyday life. I don't know of anything better.
B00003CXA3|4.0|The Tuminaro Case. That is what the law enforcement community calls \\"the French Connection\\" case of 1968. Two rough-and-tumble NYPD Narcotics detectives named Eddie Egan and Sonny Grosso stumbled on a heroin-smuggling ring which spanned the Atlantic and linked the New York Mafia with a French mob operating out of Marsailles, which, if you are not familiar with it, is a great port city in the Mediterranean famous for, among other things, being a stop on the great heroin pipeline between Turkey, Siciily, Corsica, Continental Europe, and the Big Apple. This discovery was the birth of the understanding that the heroin trade was big international business, being conducted on a breathtaking scale, and the efforts of local cops and a few federal agents to stop it by busting junkies and street dealers was as ludicrous as handing out speeding tickets at the Indy 500.<br />In the end, somewhere between 100 - 300 kilos of pure heroin were seized, the ring was smashed, two cops sprung to fame by making the big case (\\"Went through The Door\\", in NYPD Narc lexicon), and the soon-to-be legendary NYPD Special Investigations Unit was created. But at what cost, and to what end?<br />This is what the film version of \\"The French Connection\\" examines, changing the names of the players (to Popeye Doyle, played by the great Gene Hackman, and Cloudy Russo, played by the criminally underrated Roy Schieder, respectively) but leaving the basic facts of the story intact. Very few movies have attempted to show the methodology and mind-set of Narc detectives without either glamorizing them or apologizing for them; \\"TFC\\" does neither. Doyle is a truly disgusting human being, but a [darn] good cop. He has the ego, the spleen, the recklessness, and the obsessive won't-let-go mentality of a pit bull, which more or less typefied the Narcs of the pre-Knapp Comission years. If you want a cop like Doyle off your case, you pretty much have to kill him. And if you try, don't miss.<br />The SIU, an elite branch of the Narcotics Division, was born during this investigation. No police unit in history probably bagged more hard drugs, busted more big-name dealers, or wrought such havoc with the drug trade in the Big Apple. On the other hand, no police unit in history ever broke so many laws doing it:<br />the tactics used by Doyle and Russo in \\"TFC\\" became standard procedure for the SIU: Illegal wiretaps. Shakedowns. Theft of money. Distribution of heroin to informants. Perjury. Extortion. Entrapment. You name it, they did it, and operated with virtually no supervision for about ten years before another famous cop, Bob Leuici, who got his own movie (\\"Prince of the City\\") brought down the house by exposing its inherent corruption. About seventy detectives served in SUI and of them, more than fifty ended up being indicted, and most went to prison. A number killed themselves. In a moment of true irony, several SIU detectives were fingered in the theft of 300 pounds of heroin from the police evidence lockup. The heroin in question was the evidence seized by Egan and Grosso in the Tuminaro Case. So in the end, it was largely for nothing. The H hit the street anyway.<br />I read some review of this film which question its morality, its supposed affirmantion of the 'war on drugs' and even liken \\"Connection\\" to the Nazi propiganda film \\"Triumph of the Will\\" because it seems to endorse the ends-justifying-tactics of Doyle and Russo. These people are missing the point entirely. The French Connection is not politicized fiction, like \\"Blow.\\" It is a real case, the detectives were real people, and these were the real methods they used to crack it. The scene where Hackman chases his would-be assassin all across New York, endangering the lives of about 100 people in the process, says more than any dialogue could about his personality. In other words, this movie isn't about the drug trade, it's about the cops who fight it.<br /><br />\\"TFC\\" is NOT an endorsement of the war on drugs; it simply lays out what happened here in a dramatized fashion. Like all great movies, it does not tell the viewer what to think but allows him/her to come to his own conclusion. And by the way, the movie most certainly DOES imply that the drug war, or at least this particular battle in it, was futile. The 'what happened to them' blurbs at the end of the film demonstrate this in no uncertain terms.<br />Looking back I see this is not a proper review of the film but more of a rant. ...<br />I'm through venting. Sorry. I'll make up for it with this: \\"The French Connection\\" is a great crime drama, brilliantly acted, superbly directed, and deserves every bit of its reputation as one of the greatest films of all time. I'm going to buy it on DVD today.lays out what happened here in a dramatized fashion.

B00005JLWN|4.0|I must admit I found Equilibrium more entertaining on the big screen, but it is THE best kung fu-turistic movie built in recent years.  But I digress, the style was more Japanese than Chinese. So it may have been Bushido-licious! Unlike Reloaded, I wanted to see EQ again, which I did as long as it was at the theater (2-3 weeks).  It's like a unusually good snack chip, before you know it, the bag is empty and wanted more. The action scenes are slick, straight forward and full tilt. So delicious you'll look for crumbs.  Odd, considering it had no where near the budget of reloaded...or a jacked up ending either.  Bottom line: EQ is better than the last 2 Star Wars movies and Reloaded.  Bold - but are you bold and daring?
B000069HK2|1.0|The Used has to be one of the worst bands that I have ever heard. I turned on MTV the other day and there they were doing a concert. The lead singer kept on whining around and then after awhile he just started screaming for no reason at all. It was the most pathetic thing that I have ever seen. I could only understand maybe 5 words in the whole song. All I can say is please do yourself a favor and dont buy this. And if it can be avoided,dont even listen to this stuff either.
B00008G9JO|1.0|Tull did NOT die after Thick as a Brick!! they never did. and with Heavy Horses they prove it. The album opens with the first track. The opening guitar riffs are immediately audible. As the song progresses, Ian Anderson uses microphones on his vocals. The next three songs have a slower beat, but a deep blues sound going through them. Heavy Horses is the true coming of age for Jethro Tull in that all the stories in the songs were like a renisance of time. I AM A GREAT TULL FAN AND I A POSSESS ALL OF THEM.... AND THAT'S THE REASON WHY I DARE TO MKE SUCH AN APPRECIATION FOR THIS &quot;UNIQUE&quot; ROCK BAND....&quot;I AM TOO OLD TO ROCK N ROLL AND TOO YOUNG TOO DIE&quot;.
0425152251|1.0|I had to read this book over the summer for an english assignment, and I've got to say this is probably the worst book I have ever read! It was painful having to read this book, and I had to make a little scheduale for when I would force myself to read it. It also seems to be very religious, and it's constantly mentioning why god did this or that. The book did not get good until the last three chapters. I do not reccomend buying this book if you're looking for enjoyable reading.

B00005JMD3|4.0|I have to admit I'm not old enough to have indulged in the TV show version of this movie, so I didn't have anything to compare it to. However, I think the movie did very well.  Afterall, they pretty much already had a working script, since they didn't have to think of anything original.  And director Clark Johnson seemed to have more fun with the action, than with anything else. <br />The main set up is that Jim Street (Colin Farrell) is a hot shot, tough guy hottie (like he is in pretty much all of his movies.)  He's  a S.W.A.T member and ends up getting reamed, along with his partner when his partner (Jeremy Renner) shoots a hostage as part of a stand off when he was told to wait. They get the bad guy, but wounded hostage doesn't sit well with his captain. <br />His partner ops to leave when they are taken off S.W.A.T.  Basically, he's upset that Jim won't stand with him in giving the finger to the higher ups. He thinks Jim is sucking up and selling out.  <br />After an argument, and a violent reaction by Jim's friend, in the locker room, Jim stays and does his time in the gun cage where he's demoted and Jeremy leaves. <br />Cut to 6 months later and Jim is still tooling away in the gun cage until Sam Jackson swaggers  in with his coolness and cockness, and grudge against the captain, and puts together a very impressive team of S.W.A.T member, Jim being one of them.<br />The comraderie between the members is fun and funny to watch. Chris Sanchez (Michelle Rodriguez) is the only female, but her hard eye, growling snarl and tough stare makes her believable in playing with the guys and guns.  The  PG-13 romance that begins to bloom between Colin and Michelle is sweet, mainly because Colin has just the right blend of  charm, over-confidence and sexiness to make it work.   He's very comfortable with the ladies. <br />Our villian is Alex (Olivier Martinez), the French hottie from Unfaithful,  and, as an arrested drug overlord, he has the city in a frenzy when he puts out the call that anyone bad enough to break him out will pocket  100 million dollars. He has gang members all over trying their hand and failing, but the S.W.A. T members try to stay a step ahead of the nutcases. <br />Okay, the plot is reaching, but there are several great action sequences that help the movie move along. There isn't much lagging in between scenes because the dialogue is funny, catchy, and the chemistry between the team members is so good.  They all quickly become an extended family, look out for each other and end up being a force against the Police Captain who  has a hard-on for them to fail.<br />Samuel and Colin play great off each other other, and L.L. Cool J and Michelle Rodriguez are added bonuses.  If you're looking for flaws, you may find them, but over all, the action is fantastic, dialogue is funny; silly at times and Colin is eye candy. <br />I was actually surprised to see it rated PG-13, so you sure won't see any sex or cursing. Actually,  there wasn't even any kissing.  Mild flirting it is. <br />Still, this works if you like action and fun, and it was just long enough.
B000002A46|5.0|This CD is nothing short of exquisite! I find myself listening to it even when its not Xmas time just for some spiritual inspiration. My favorite song is 'O'Holy Night' which is truly one of the most beautifully sung renditions I've ever heard (she does her supernatural high note at the very end) I also loved 'Joy to the World', and 'Jesus Oh What a Wonderful Child' which is amazing if you're into gospel.  I continue to root and support Mariah because of her talented singing and songwriting ability. Its unfortunate that many of her fickle US fans have seemingly turned their back on her not to mention radio, and the music industy as a whole. Mariah Carey deserves a lot more respect than these overexposed, marginally talented, pop tarts that are getting a lot more respect despite being only 1/10th as talented. Its disappointing, to say the least, that her career isn't what it once was. I rarely hear her songs on the radio anymore, or read anything positive about her (she's gotten a little better press lately). I feel, like there's been a collective front to try to destroy her career and ever since she left Columbia Records she doesn't seem to get any airplay for new material. Perhaps the material needs to be better (I didn't purchase Charmbracelet due to lack of interest) at any rate this is CD is totally worth purchasing even if its just to have a soulful collection of Xmas classics. I also recommend the Glitter CD which was surprisingly excellent! SHOW YOUR SUPPORT AND GO TO HER CONCERTS THIS SUMMER! WAKE UP EVERYONE, SHE WORKS SO HARD PARTLY TO PLEASE US, HER FANS, SO DON'T DISAPPOINT HER!! Keep ya head up Mariah!
0448060191|5.0|How can you not love this tale of 4 sisters struggling to have a normal life despite a father away fighting in the Civil War and diminished means because of his absence?  Jo is a feminist of whom Susan B. Anthony would be proud.  Poor Beth is so good and easy to love that her illness is heart-breaking.  Meg is strong and practical.  And Amy, well, you have to love her despite her vanity and selfishness.  Of course, Marmee is the tie that binds this family together.  So many wonderful movie adaptations of this beloved novel have been produced, including the very faithful one starring Winona Ryder, but, really, one should read this novel to totally immerse themselves in the lives of the March girls.  If you love the movie, do yourself the favor of reading this book.  Read it to your young daughter, or buy your 4th, 5th, or 6th grader her very own copy to treasure.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|This film is by far... oh sooooo much by far the best film of the year - UN-BE-LEE-VA-BLE! If you haven't seen it, then OH ylou better get out there and watch it - Its funny, action packed and just totally wicked! Orlando Bloom was buff but I dont think anyone could beat Johnny Depp - He cracked me up big tym - He was hilarious and also totally scrummy!<br />Not sure about the CD - Haven't got it but I will have it soon! I'm sure it will be great as it is from the film :-P

B00009RGBS|5.0|I walked into \\"Chicago\\" not knowing a thing about it. I am a fan of musicals but that certainly does NOT mean they can't be ruined in a movie. <br />Having said that..<BR>Renee Zellweger was outstanding in this movie and it is a CRIME that she did not recieve the Oscar! She dances, sings and acts like a pro to the point that you believe she IS Roxie Hart. Catherine Zeta-Jones who DID win an Oscar(she deserved it the most), was sexy and humorous in the movie and the fact that she can sing and dance like a broadyway actress helps as well! Richard Gene is fantastic as a silver-tounged lawyer and the supporting cast includes a wheeling and dealing Queen Latifah, a cellophane-like man: John C. Reily and a \\"Sob Sister\\" role for Christine Baranski.  <BR>   Set in the jazzy 1920's, the story opens with \\"All that Jazz\\" proving that it revolves around Roxie Hart(Zellwegger) who wants more than anything to be a vaudville star.When the man she is cheating on her husband with walks out on her with the words \\"You're a two-bit talent with skinny legs-face it Roxie, you ain't never gonna have an act!\\", Zellweger's character shoots him dead. When her \\"Funny Honey\\" Amos arrives home, he is prepared to take the blame-'till he discovers what Fred Casley and his Roxie were doing every night. Roxie is shipped off to jail, were famous vaudville legend Velma Kelly (Zeta-Jones) is imprisoned for the same crime. Matron \\"Mama\\" Morton promises Roxie to help her for a price in \\"When Your Good to Mama\\". Enter Billy Flynn the best criminal lawyer in all of Chicago, \\"All I Care About\\". One of his best lines is: \\"I don't mean to toot my own horn but if Jesus Christ had lived in Chicago and had $5000, things would have turned out differently.\\" Flynn is also Velma's lawyer and Velma isn't to happy about him taking Roxie's case. Within a week ROXIE ROCKS CHICAGO is the headline and everyone, including reporter Mary Sunshine (Baranski) believes that Roxie and Casley \\"both reached for the gun\\" The nameon everyone's lips is \\"Roxie\\". Velma tries to gain Roxies trust by offering to do an act with her in \\"I can't do it alone\\". But the now extremely arrogant Roxie says no. Roxie announces her pregnancy but Amos realises that he isn't the father! He also realises how pathetic and sad his life is in \\"Mister Cellophane.\\" Roxie turns on the old \\"Razzle Dazzle\\" during her trial-and is found absolutally NOT GUILTY! However-no one wants to take her picture, but after all-that's Chicago! Then out of the blue-something amazing happens: Velma and Roxie are in a show TOGETHER and have one back all that was lost! <BR>  This movie will appeal to everyone in some way. The camerawork is unique and the setting really looks like the 1920s. The dancing is the best-the singing is great-the script couldn't be better-GO SEE IT. END OF STORY!
6305428220|3.0|&quot;The Facult&quot; is one of those movies were you wonder if they went over budget twords the end, and had to fill in the rest with not much more than a  generic and predictiable ending. I must  itmite that the begining is very well done, and makes you want too watch more. but farther on in you start too lose intrest. I'm a person who enjoy's a good horror movie were it dosen't show so much violence, and leaves your mind up to what hapened. In this film you see way too much. It dosen't give you that phsycalogical feeling of suspense. I would recomend this movie to someone who can stand more violence than normal.
B000092ZYX|5.0|this album musically is definitely one of the best i've ever heard. sonically layered and minimal at the same time, i crave it. lyrically, this is the scariest thing i've ever heard. think bigger, people, then politics. think biblical prophesy and nostrodamis type stuff. think of revelation as ongoing and don't kill the messinger. listen, listen, listen, you have not been paying attention. if you listen (and read along the lyrics) and expand your scope, this album will say things to you that you really don't want to hear. listen to it, then repent, for the end (the gloaming) is near.
0689835604|4.0|I bought this book because it came highly recommemnded and was one of AZ's best sellers. The only suggestion I have is that be careful giving this book to a toddler to look at themselves. Since the book has flaps that reveal \\"Where things are\\" they are easily ripped out. My daughter is 11 months old and I thought this would the perfect introduction to books. This may be considered a little young but she absolutely LOVES books and likes turning pages. That is why we opt for board books in the very beginning because the pages can be easily turned and are more durable than regular childrens'[paper] books. My only warning is if you do buy this book and your child likes to tear/pull things, beware. Or just wait until they are older and know not to. Otherwise, you are in for alot of ripped flaps.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|This CD is my new favorite!! I first heard Gavin perform on the tonight show (or one of those night time shows) and his unique voice was a refreshing change from the over played pop sound that is so popular in music right now. I was begging for a change in sound (or at least more then one sound)and he pulled it off. A new fresh sound that has the potencial to being BIG! A lot of his chord progressions sound similar to the Beatles music which is AWESOME!! Not only do I love the scruffy voice of Gavin but who couldn't love his music?? I was a little sceptical about &quot;chemical party&quot; at first because it's so different from the rest of his music, but after listening to it more I realize how it compliments the rest of the CD with a different sound. Because of that track it makes it easy to listen to the CD over and over without getting sick of all the songs sounding similar, like other artist have a tendincy to falling into. I just wish I could see him in concert because I heard it's so much better to be right there in person. The only thing I would change about the CD is possiably add music from another artist. On the tv show that I first saw him on he did a song from the motion picture &quot;Shreck&quot;. It was awesome!!!! I think when he performs other peoples music, it gives him a chance to really show off his unique voice because people listen to his voice rather then the awesome new song that he wrote. GO GAVIN!!! This guy is going to be BIG!!!
B00003CX5P|2.0|Well, the first Star Wars film in over 20 years and it turned out to be rubbish. My expectations shattered in 2 hours. Actually no make 45 mins after Jar Jar Binks appears. <br />First, the good points. Neeson is pretty good in this and rather convincing as a thoughtful older Jedi. Palpatine is good too and subtle in his creepy role.<br />The effects for the most part are well done, more convincing than in Ep2 actually. But everything looks too new and shiny. A problem that has yet to be solved with CGI. The ships in the originals are MUCH more convincing. They look used.<br />Emmmm....now some of the bad points. <br />As already mentioned, Jar Jar Binks. Well, single handedly, almost, this absolutely AWFUL character ruined what would have been an average first installment to the new trilogy. He must have been thought up when George [was not well], because I cannot imagine anyone with any kind of writing skills or imagination finding this stupid clunky, idiot being remotely funny. In fact the Gugan's as a whole were a terrible idea. But its indicative of how George Lucas's mind works. Take the Ewoks in ROTJ for example. Originally Endor was a planet of Wookies, but Georgy Porgy changed it to little teddy bears. Why? MONEY. He knew that they would be a hit with stupid people and kids. Therefore generating money. Ewok was a household name, but its not mentioned once in the entire film. Obviously Lucas hoped to replicate this in Ep1.......and FAILED miserably. JAR JAR BINKS IS NOT FUNNY. He also does not deserve to be in any film, never mind a StarWars movie.<br />Ewan McGregor....well, hes ok. He tries hard to be a young Alec Guinness, but unfortunately I just cannot see him bringing out any of Ben Kenobi in the film.<br />That bloody kid! Oh my God. When I first saw the poster I thought that maybe he'd be good. He looked moody and with the shadow of Vader behind him, I thought that the new trilogy would be a gloomy and grim affair, WHICH IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN. But instead Lucas decided to make a kiddies film, with a kiddy star! This child is onscreen TOO MUCH....FAR TOO MUCH. I just wanted to slap him. And that pod race.....com'on he's a child....I don't care if he's got Jedi reflexes. Its just way too hard to suspend my disbelief.<br />Portman is beautiful, but like Jar Jar doesn't belong in a Star Wars film, but for different reasons. She just looks bored by the whole affair, like she is in Ep2. And that stupid \\"twist\\" of her being replaced by her handmaiden.....what?<br />The \\"droids\\". \\"Roger, Roger\\" indeed. They are brutal, unconvincing and absolute no threat whatsoever. George has chosen to make the enemy a useless army of Microsoft bug ridden foul ups. Can anyone imagine an army of these idotic machines actually winning any battle?<br />All in all, if this had been directed by somebody else, with a tighter script and an actually threatening \\"menace\\" then it would have been an ok introduction to the new trilogy. But as it stands, it is not worth buying. Juat so it doesn't interfer with the original trilogy.<br />I wonder if George could go back in 20 years and edit out the Jar Jar Binks scenes, like he did with the original Star Wars, only in reverse. Instead of putting in an awful representation of a character (Jabba the Hut), he could take one out and improve the film immensely.<br />Tony
6305079811|4.0|I've had a full screen VHS version of this movie for years and was resigned to Uenichversal never releasing it on DVD. I don't understand what gets released on DVD and what doesn't. I can get Cannibal Apocalypse and 20 different versions of Night of the Living Dead or Evil Dead 1 but not Flash Gordon, which actually with it's amazing sets and costumes and incredible music screams to be put on DVD!! <br />Well thank the great god Daizan that other countries have this classic on DVD and we get to watch it anyway! I literally felt like I was watching it for the first time when I popped in the disc and cranked up the stereo. I know a lot of people have had this movie grow on them in the last 20 years but I loved it at the age of 10 when I saw it in the theatre and I've always loved it. Max Von Sydow completely owns the role of Ming and plays one of the best villain performances of all time. <br />What I love so much is that even with the weakest components being the lead actors in the title role and role of Dale Arden it plain just doesn't matter. The movie is so rich in visual splendor and the supporting roles are so well played with gusto that it truly becomes an ensemble movie.<br />And, if you don't think this movie kicks ass when the Hawkmen attack War Rocket Ajax and those huge Brian May power cords kick in then you might as well make the final reservation at Sleepy Willow village in Florida right now!!.
B000063DHL|3.0|Somewhere In Time sounds very much a product of the era in which it was made.  That's not necessarily always a bad thing.  But, we saw the [sad] trends that invaded the metal community in '86, such as Priest's \\"Turbo\\" and UFO's \\"Misdemeanor.\\"  Luckily, Maiden did not bow to the \\"public tastes\\" nearly as much here as on the aforementioned failed experiments.  However, Somewhere In Time definitely has lost a considerable amount of wholup when compared to Piece Of Mind and Powerslave.  The first signs of a band on auto-pilot show up here on the tunes Heaven Can Wait,  with a melody that tries way too hard and turns out being annoying (though the vocal chant is fun), and the plain yawner Deja Vu.  However, much of the rest is trademark Maiden, albeit with a few synths and a more commercial sound than before.  Even catchy lead single Wasted Years sounds like it was meant as a hit, while the hardest track, Sea of Madness, has a radio friendly solo break spliting it down the middle.  Alexander the Great revisits past history lessons with mixed results, the song being complex enough even if the ly-rucks are a bit half baked.<BR>   Somewhere In Time will be forever tied to spandex and big hair (thankfully Maiden avoided the hair thing).  Even Eddie looks a too tech. But the album art is cool and contains a bunch of references to Maiden's previous work.  Overall, Somewhere doesn't go much of anywhere... but does a better job doing it than most of the releases from this time from England's metal elite.

Well, it wasn't a magic bullet, as you might have guessed, but it is a very practical and easy way to keep your house clean.

B00005RFQ5|1.0|This album is bad.  It's not even bad in a fun campy way.  If you thought \\"Animal Kingdom\\" from Prince's \\"The Truth\\" album was preachy and condecending you haven't heard the start of it!  The music is still interesting but the lyrics are so offensive in a over-the-top Jerry-Falwell kind of way that I reccomend that you buy everything up to \\"Crystal Ball\\" and forget that Prince ever did anything after it.  I paid [money amount] for this album and it was too much at that.<br /><br />Addendum; I still hate this album and had declared Prince \\"dead to me\\" because of it.  However; starting back up with 3121, Prince may have gone all Jehovah's Witness but he has remembered how to Rock.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|The 2nd best western of all time - after the Outlaw Josey Wales.<BR>Captivating characters and story from beginning to end...like reading a good book. As a bonus you will see the greatest gunfight ever filmed (next would be the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly).
0385335482|2.0|This book is really perfect for people who have been in debt, or can perhaps relate to the main character. I found that this book was hard for me to read not because of its predictability or silliness, but because I was frustrated with the actions. I did not understand why she could not simply do something about her shopping obsession, or why no one stepped in to help the heroine control her debt.<br />The story is really quite trite. Besides being predicable, it was boring. Some of the ironic things in the book, such as her job in finances, and attempts to save money by going to a museum (which turn out disastrously) were funny, but just not enough to elevate the plot. The book did however inspire me to stay out of debt as I was able to see the downward spiral of her life, and I do not want that to happen to me. I learned a bit about myself too, in that I may need to read more books about people with problems to help me with patience and problem-solving skills.<br />Rebecca Bloomwood, the main character, has some nice friends, and people who do support her. It is surprising to me that they could not step in and help her, which irks me. I feel that while the book would not have been as long if she had gotten help, it might have been more realistic. The shopping setting was intriguing though, especially as it takes place in Europe.<br />I think that in the age of chick-lit, there are many better picks. I did not like this book because it was so clichéd, and irritating to me. However, someone who likes shopping, or feels they could relate to the in-debt spender may enjoy it. I did find many parts of the book to be humorous though, so if one can stick through the other parts, I did find myself laughing aloud. Of course, that is just my teenage opinion; I could be wrong.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|Godsmack was a ultimate album to me,Awake was the cd i listened to everyday,now I have Faceless to listen to and Faceless is Godsmacks best album,Faceless is my best cd in my cd wallet out of 125 (including Godsmack and Awake)I listen to Faceless daily(im listening to it right now)and I saw Godsmack in concert in Austin Texas at WaterLoo Park  and I loved the sound so much and I thought the album sounded like the Album so much and everytime I listen to Faceless I feel the energy that was at the concert!!!
0312305060|4.0|It was difficult for me to get absorbed in this book. I would think that anyone who likes parallel stories will like this book, but while I love parallel stories, I found that this parallel was not as prominent as I had wished, and it took me a long time to totally get it. <br />The actual story is full of twists and turns, and there is a lot of connection of which the reader needs to be aware. As I said, the parallel is not very prominent, but it comes together nicely at the end. In essence, the book does keep one guessing.<br />I look forward to seeing the movie, and perhaps I will then re-read the book. In my upcoming high school and college years, I may read Mrs. Dalloway, and perhaps in having read The Hours I will better appreciate the works of Virginia Wolf.<br />I learned a bit about people, and their struggles through reading this. The characters are all very well developed. I thought that every action or thought that a particular character might have was incredibly fitting for the personality of that character. Some of the spontaneous actions that readers may not foresee are later obvious seeming when reflecting on the book.<BR> <BR>The book was slow, until the end, when it finally came together for me. I found myself wondering why I did not anticipate the events and relationships. I probably would have better enjoyed this book had I read it in fewer sittings, and I recommend that it is read over a shorter period. I don't think that there is a &quot;type&quot; of person for whom this book is perfect. I do think that people who enjoy analyzing and such would very much like it. Of course, that is just my teenage opinion; I could be wrong.
B00005QG9J|2.0|I got into Incubus with S.C.I.E.N.C.E. which is by far their best album, and though I was disappointed with the direction Make Yourself took, Morning View just made me not care at all about the band anymore. They went from a great hard rock/metal band into a soft rock/pop band and to put it bluntly it [is bad]. I'm not saying the CD is bad, just bad compared to everything else they've done. If you're into the slow boring poppy music then this CD is great, if you're expecting the Incubus of old, don't bother.
B00009XITP|3.0|OK, if you consider this to be just a teen movie, then it is fine.  I personally thought it is rather stupid and slow moving, nothing too hilarious. However, I was surprised that my 13-year old child liked it, so maybe it just seems stupid for us.  It is just aimed at a different audience.  Nice British scenery.  I liked how Colin played, although I don't think his role required too much mastery.  He was just well suited with all his previous roles and image.<BR>Anyway, it is an OK relaxing movie that you will quickly forget, unless you are a teen or a Colin fan.
B00005V3Z4|3.0|Captain Corelli's Mandolin would have been my favourite novel of all time if it wasn't for the ending, which appears hastily written and grafted. Similarly, the ending to Donnie Darko, which is an original and hypnotic movie (see other reviews), feels as if the makers had to finish it off in order for it to be released. There are so many inconsistencies and at the risk of being called a nerd, the writer(s) either forgot or ignored the problems of temporal paradox. (Please see Back to the Future and co.) A temporal vortex cannot solve bad script writing.<br />A reviewer to Captain Corelli's Mandolin said that one should not complain about a fine meal if only the coffee was bad, however, it does leave a bad taste in your mouth...
B00005JLYW|5.0|I like this movie as you read above. Some sequals seem to be very [bad]. This is an exception. This is similar to the second one but a little better. I like how they had John Cleese in it. They also had a few cameos that where interesting, i think one was Bill Murray, and another one Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen. This movie kept my attention the whole way through and it didn't seem like it was all going too fast or slow so it had a great flow of the story line. I say get this movie and hope for a sequal.
0156027321|1.0|I loved the beginning of this book.  It was great.  I liked the information about animals and religions.  However, as soon as Pi got stranded in the ocean, this book took a nosedive.  It became boring and vey gory.  When I finished it, I felt an intense hatred toward the second part.  I even ripped it in half and threw it out.  However, the beginning was wonderful.
0060934913|5.0|A very entertaining but kind of scary book when you start to think about what's going on in those kitchens, especially in NY.  He is a great writer and very entertaining to watch on the Food Network. Now I know when not to eat fish.  I am trying to further my career and perhaps become a cook in the kitchen.  Right now I  am working as a waitress.  I purchased the Study Guide for the National Servsafe Exam: Key Review Questions and Answers with Explanations by Patrick Leonardi, to help me understand the way the kitchen suppose to run and to prevent food borne illnesses. An excellent book whether your in the business or not, even housewifes should have this book in their kitchens, including caterers.

B00005QG9J|5.0|Alright, here goes...Many would argue that Incubus drastically changed their style, from crazy funk-hiphop to mellow alternative rock and are now &quot;sell-outs&quot;.  I would have to disagree, Incubus did not &quot;sell-out&quot;.  They have in fact changed their music, but only because they matured.  Although, I am personally prefer to listen to their earlier stuff, like the albums, S.C.I.E.N.C.E., Enjoy Incubus, and Fungus Amongus, their newer albums, Make Yourslef and this album, Morning View are excellent.  Morning View contains well-written lyrics, which are thought-out, and Brandon's voice is absolutely amazing.  You can't forget Mike and DJ Kilmore for their huge contribuation to making this CD as good as it is.  So, people, shut up about Incubus becoming mainstream, it is alright for a band to evolve and explore other types of music.  Wouldn't it be a bore if every Incubus album that came out every two years was the same kind of music, with no diversity?  And quite possibly Incubus changed for the better, considering their younger years were somewhat immature, choosing a life filled with drugs and surfboards and nothing else?
9998221641|5.0|Whenever I meet someone who enjoys reading history, this is the book I always seem to recommend first (I love reading history).  It is so beautifully written.  It has the drama and intrigue of a novel, yet Barbara Tuchman, as she notes in her book Practicing History, always worked from primary resources.  This work of history is accurate.  And all of her books are great: Guns of August, Proud Tower, Zimmerman Telegram, Stillwell, to name a few. A Distant Mirror stands out, in my opinion, because it vividly describes how difficult, how different and, indeed how &quot;calamitous&quot; Western Civilization was in the 14th century. From reading this book, I am more thankful to live today and not then.  Yet, how exhilirating it was to read and really feel how it was. I defy anyone who starts it to put it down easily.
B00005JLEU|5.0|This is a seamless, endearing story of the human element against adversity. A fancy wordy of saying soooo......goooodd...<br />The dubbed version is good, but for the american girl who did Chihiro's voice....GAH! Dying crows in heat sound better during the beautiful dramatic music....So poorly chosen. She made Chihiro sound whiny, young, and like a mosquito trapped in a jar. Please, by all means watch this, but even if it's irritating, watch the origional japanese with subtitles. You'll treasure it so much more.

B000001ESP|5.0|Some have said that The Moody Blues brought bombast to rock music.  Rush takes the progressive bombast of The Moody Blues to loftier, even more excessive and electronic heights.  In the process they have created one of the most accessible progressive rock albums.<br />\\"Tom Sawyer\\" kicks off the album with one of the three most progressive songs on the album, with the other two being \\"The Camera Eye\\" and \\"Witch Hunt.\\"  All three glory in being bombastic and pretentious with exquisitely overblown keyboards of multiple types.  This song, with its hard driving guitar and synth driven music, is about what Mark Twain's Tom Sawyer would be like in today's world.  One of the best lines from this song is:<br /> And what you say about his company<br /> Is what you say about society.<br />The truth of these lyrics is that however uncomfortable today's Tom Sawyer may make you feel, it is your criticism of him that is at the heart of society's problem; a grandiose variation on a theme that goes back at least to Janis Ian's \\"Society's Child.\\"  The music and lyrics are incredibly catchy for a progressive rock song.<br />Science fiction is often a theme in much progressive music, and \\"Red Barchetta\\" is in this category.  The song is about a future where gasoline-powered cars are banned.  The song's protagonist likes to visit his Uncle's Farm where a Red Barchetta is hidden in the barn.  Our hero loves to go for joy rides, racing back to a one-lane bridge to avoid the police cars that are too wide to fit onto it.  Once our hero returns, he dreams with his Uncle at the fireside.  While we do not know for sure what they dream about, we can guess it is a dream of the time when fast cars ruled the road, and joy rides were about how fast one could drive rather than whether one could drive at all.<br />\\"YYZ\\" is an excellent rock instrumental.  The rhythm is very catchy and accessible.  YYZ is the airport code for Toronto, which is where the group went to make it big from their hometown of Sarnia, Ontario.<br />The next song was the last on the first side of the tape or album.  \\"Limelight\\" was a bona fide hit for the group, and was sufficiently progressive to help convince people, along with Rush's other hits in the 80s, that progressive rock was not yet dead.  While the song may have some elements of progressive, it also has elements of mainstream rock.<br />\\"The Camera Eye\\" is a perspective of New York and London in glorious electronic excessiveness.  The lyrics take a back seat to the overwhelming keyboards on this piece; easily the most overblown piece on the CD, and also perhaps one of the most progressive.  Rush typically enjoys artistic and descriptive lyrics, but here the lyrics are very understated with the music conveying the perspective of the birds-eye view of New York and London.  This song has all the elements that critics of progressive rock love to criticize, which means it is one of my favorite songs on this album.<br />\\"Witch Hunt\\" is ominous and chilling.  Keyboards lay a heavy bass track to chill you to the bone as you envision the crowd that hunted Frankenstein, or the Wolf Man, or the mob out after anyone who is NOT LIKE US.  This track is the most cutting edge on the album and also the most progressive.  The lyrics are reasonably accessible, but the sinister music takes some time to fully appreciate; another of my favorites from this album.<br />The last song is a bit of a departure from Rush's norm.  \\"Vital Songs\\" has a sort of reggae beat in the style of The Police, for example the style of \\"Don't Stand So Close to Me.\\"  The song took me a while to get into because the style is very different from everything else on this album.  Furthermore, it is probably the most mainstream in styling of any song on the album.  I will avoid attempting to interpret the wonderfully obscure and poetic lyrics.<br />Rush managed to create a progressive rock album that was close to the edge of progressive rock, sometimes crossing more into the mainstream, so that the album is every accessible.  Much of the music is catchy, though most of the lyrics take time to understand.  Many fans consider this album Rush's best.  I liked it well enough that in preparation for this review it remained in my car's stereo for two weeks solid.  A truly great album.stream, so that the album is every accessible.

0151006903|4.0|Umberto Eco enjoys telling a thick story.  Baudolino is exactly that.  A pseudo-historical novel, it chronicles the life of Baudolino, a master of languages and lies.  Eco tells a fantastic story, taking Baudolino from a poor peasant to searching for the mythical preacher-king Prester John.  What makes Baudolino so intruiging is the aspect of the unreliable narrator.  Since Baudolino the compulsive liar is telling his own story, the reader can never be sure what the truth really is.  This leads to some very wild tales that complicate the story to no end.  Baudolino was an extremely enjoyable novel, but requires the reader to have a little patience to weed through this dense thicket of a story.
B000069AUI|5.0|There is not much that can be said for Coldplay's sophomore effort other than this, incredible. If there is a singer in or around the rock scene that has the vocal impact of Chris Martin, I would love to know who it is. Mr. Martin can evoke such emotion with his soft, lilting voice that it is hard to not be affected by it. On songs such as the staggeringly beautiful &quot;The Scientist,&quot; he reaches deep inside himself to tap into something that many popular singers lack: Heart. Highly recommended for fans of earnest, emotional music.
B00005NOOH|5.0|This is the best documentary series I have ever watched - far better than the good but overrated Ken Burns' Civil War. The use of nothing but actually wartime footage is a masterstroke. The text is well-researched and written. And the filmmakers should be commended for treating all sides, even the Germans, with fairness. It must have been very difficult to gather this footage, especially from the Soviet Union. <br />The series looks at the war from all sides, but it is missing one episode - China. There is some discussion of China when discussing Japanese aggression (Nanjing Massacre, etc), and a little bit when dealing with the British in Burma. But I feel that to make the series truely complete, an episode that explores the relationship between the Communists and Nationalists, Mao Zedong and Chiang Kai-Shek, as well as US support for Chiang, the Burma Road, and other issues in China is needed. The Chinese-Japanese war was huge in terms of loss of life, and I felt like it was ignored. Perhaps this is because of the difficulty of getting footage out of Communist China or Nationalist Taiwan in the 1970s when the series was made, or maybe there is not any footage of Mao or Chiang during the war. But really this is a small complaint.<br />Considering that this is my only complaint, one should realize just how thorough this series truely is. It is very, very good.

B000099T2L|5.0|Firstly i would like to say i gave this cd 5 stars because Beyonce CAN sing, but i didnt love all of this album. I enjoy love songs, but when you have a entire album with love songs it gets old. It is just my personal prefrence i guess but i wish she had branched off and did songs about different issue then just love. Good for her she is in love but thats not all she is, she has had a rough life and i think she should have done some songs about her struggles as well as her love.
B00006RINF|5.0|I've been an avid Lacuna Coil fan since I heard \\"To Live is to Hide\\" off the Unleased Memories album in early 2002.  Their fourth album, Comalies, was realeased late 2002 and is their best work yet(I'm finally getting around to writing my review).  They combine harmony, heaviness, and energy into one without making it sound cheesy like so many of their \\"gothic metal\\" counterparts.  Among the standout tracks on Comalies are Daylight Dancer, Entwined, The Ghost Woman and the Hunter, and Unspoken.  In all of Lacuna Coil's albums there are no bad songs to be heard.  Ripoff bands like Evanescence can't hold a candle to these guys, so don't bother wasting your time listening to them while knowing that there is so much better out there.  Lacuna Coil is more than simply music. It is an experience to be taken in for anyone with discriminating musical tastes.  Listen to them and be proud!

6302759110|5.0|All too often vampire movie vampires are too moody to be scary, too digusting to see seductive, or too poorly acted to be worth watching.  Oldman makes a great Dracula -- scary, seductive, intense.  The supporting cast is great too even if some of the actors on their own may come across as wooden, it all works pretty well here.  It made me go back and rered Stoker's original -- the movie does a fair job of copying it, certainly better than Bela Lugosi's films.
B00005RFVL|4.0|Who knew Robbie Williams would do such a great job with traditional jazz/pop standards?!  His voice is a perfect match with the traditional arrangements, and he gives much humor and class to all the songs.  My favorites are &quot;Well, did You Evah&quot; (a duet with Joh Lovitz) and &quot;Somethin' Stupid&quot; (a duet with Nicole Kidman).  With &quot;It Was a Very Good Year,&quot; Williams sounds like a young Frank Sinatra.<br />All the tracks are great on this album.  Many artists would have tried to update the songs, to give them a modern, poppy or dance feel.  I applaud Williams for keeping them as they are supposed to be.  His work pays off.  This is one good album!
B00007BH5C|4.0|love the Gollum song by Emiliana Torrini...also like the song by sheela chandra...
B00009MGQL|4.0|I have been a fan of Jeff Beck for quite some time, and was excited to hear this new CD.  Unfortunately, it failed to satisfy.  This new album is essentially an extenstion of his previous album, &quot;You Had It Comin'.&quot;  While YHIC was a great album, hearing the same computer edited dance-mix songs on &quot;Jeff&quot; led me to wonder where Jeff's creativity went.  Of his past three endeavors, &quot;Who Else!&quot; was the greatest and most innovative, and probably one of his career best albums.  The two follow-up albums are still good, but not nearly as strong.<br />Although I was disappointed by &quot;Jeff,&quot; his guitar playing is still some of the greatest in the world, and he truly remains one of the best living guitar players, thus the 4-Star review.
0694003611|5.0|I'm a pre-school teacher and I have to say that this is one of my personal favorites!  It's true that at first glance, it seems too simplistic - maybe even boring.  After you've read it a few times, however, you are bound to realize that this book is a perfect way to settle any toddler in after an exciting day of fun and adventure. <br />Margaret Wise Brown knew exactly what she was doing when she wrote this book.  The rhythm and pattern of the words really do calm the reader and listener down with each turn of the page.  <br />A must have for any children's library!
0553382179|5.0|Sometimes you can't see the trees for the forest--Marla  helps us to work on the trees (stuff and junk everywhere-cluttering up our space) a little at a time, and gradually the forest of our  debris clears and we have a tidy environment.  This of course frees our souls and gives us more energy.  Her practical bit by bit  until it becomes habit, then add another bit approach is right on and I am so grateful that she wrote this book. My house has never been tidier and I just like it so much better this way.   She has a nurturing approach that is so kind with our shortcomings.   I loved the book and encourage others to check it out.
B000006NPY|5.0|A Smashing Pumpkins album is more then a collections of compositions: it is a representation of the band's current mental state.  Think of it through this relationship: if Gish was the door, Siamese Dream was the key to unlocking it.  Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness kicked it wide open, while Adore took a peek to see what was inside.<br />In the tradition of what's come before, there are the obligatory, airtime-heavy offerings such as Ava Adore and Perfect, all done very well of course.  Adore however treats us to a much higher concentration of what we've come to love about the Pumpkins: low key, intensely personal, under-the-radar anthems such as For Martha, Crestfallen, Once Upon a Time, Tear that challenge our sonic subconscious.  Never before had the band treated us with such earnestness.<br />The trouble is that an ungrateful audience wasn't interested, for reasons that still evade me.  The album had many detractors, most arguments cite the drastic new direction and sound: this is the Smashing Pumpkin's we're talking about, correct?  Have they not literally changed their tune from album to album?  Indeed, these critics fail to realize is that the transition to Adore occurred more gradually then appreciated (Twilight to Starlight gave fans an idea of what to expect).<br />On many levels Adore was inevitable: as the long awaited answer to Mellon Collie, the Pumpkin's had two choices: continue to push the envelope, or sell out by riding a winning formula.  Figuring they were already on top, they wisely chose to play it close to the artistic vest.  Let's face it: what was to gain by playing it safe if it only served to compete with contemptible Collective Soul-style imitators and to placate a fickle fan base?  To their credit the band stuck to their guns, and the result was their most ambitious project to date.

B00000K31V|2.0|The world of eXistenZ is dominated by game playing.  The players use these strange flesh pods which plug directly into the user's back.  When users play the game, they enter an ultra-realistic virtual world and play out a fantasy which is created from the mind of the users.  In this world, there is also a faction of \\"realists\\" who are bent on destroying this game technology.<br />There are some serious flaws in this movie that detract from the basically good plot idea.  First of all, the game intself is strangely bizarre and gross.  There are lots of body parts, organs, exploding heads, and bloody gunshot wounds.  It seems hard to believe that such a game would be appealing to a large enough of an audience to inspire a terrorist group to oppose it.  In fact the game is an absolute nightmare.  The second point that bothers me is that the test group is freakishly cultish, which again detracts from the idea that this game is a mainstream thing.  The test group meets in a small country church in the middle of nowhere.  Where is the logic in that?  Why isn't the product testing held at the company's headquarters?<br />For this movie to work, you have to believe that the game is the greatest thing ever, but in this movie you just don't feel that, so the point the movie is trying to get across, just doesn't get across.
B00005JM09|5.0|I thought that this movie was excellent. The car chase sequence was spectacular and the brawl between the T-X and the Terminator was brutal but thrilling. This movie to my comparsion could beat The Matrix Reloaded released earlier this year. Also the ending to this movie was darker than the other two movies and lets you know that their will be a fourth terminator.
B000059QY3|4.0|I have other DVDs of the opera that I like better. But this one is wonderful.  I enjoyed Gheorghiu's Violetta but the father's voice is just not my favorite.  However I will watch it over and over.  It is a wonderful opera.
B00009RDG9|2.0|I thought a whole movie about chasing one guy got old fast. I was bored, and fast forwarding most of it.....its the same thing over and over and over again.....not what I expected

B00006SFBD|5.0|It gets 5 stars b/c it's Opeth.  Plus the song Master's Apprentices is pure genious.  This album doesn't have as much of the acoustics and soft mellow parts (except For absent friends) as the other opeth cd's.  This is just metal.  The top tracks on this CD are Deliverance, Master's Apprentices, and By The Pain I See in Others.  Wreath and A Fair Judgement are good, but not as good as the former 3.  The reason why this album is not as good as the other Opeth ones is that it lacks the lyrical quality, the mellow parts, and the vocals seem less powerful.  Mikael's death vox are among the best in the business but on this album it doesn't sound as great as the others.  But it makes up for it with the amazing drumming and awesome guitar solos.  If you are an Opeth fan you should already have this, but if you are trying to get used to Opeth, start off with blackwater park.  Still, you should end up buying this!

B00006CXXU|4.0|I really like this CD.  I especially like the bluesy tunes.  The CD contains a wide range of music styles that keep it interesting and entertaining.  The only problem I had with it was how much Christina's voice sounds like Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston.  That's not a complaint, I just found it interesting.
B000069AUI|5.0|I just wanted to say that comparisons always fall short of their intentions. This is yet another great British Alt offering. I've seen comparisons to the Doves to early Radiohead and that's valid only in respect to genre. Coldplay seems a bit more pop than those two groups, but that does not take away from true musical talent of this band.<br />They are a pretty well hyped group and they deserve it.
B00008J4P5|5.0|This album rocks the casbah!  It's all out incredible.<br />Buy, borrow, or steal it immediately.  One of the top 5 of the year along with \\"Hail to the Thief\\" and \\"Rainy Day Music\\".
B00008LOS1|5.0|Many people might groan at the thought of Who's Next being released once again and while not being the definitive version of Who's Next, Deluxe Edition is the best there is yet. First off, the album has been remixed and remastered from the original tapes which automatically gives it an advantage over the last US remaster. Who's Next has never sounded better. The energy from the recordings bursts onto your speakers with clarity and depth. (The Canadian release which was also supposedly mastered from the original tapes had the best sound quality up until this point) The extra tracks on Disc 1, while not definitive Who's Next tracks (ala Lifehouse), definitely add to the set as they were unused alternate takes from Record Plant sessions in New York. <BR>     Disc 2 is really the best thing about this edition as it is a rare recording of The Who live at The Young Vic, 1971 which was also a test show for the Lifehouse concept. Unfortunately, Townshend's Lifehouse concept was never fully realized but the music played here is great. It's basically all Lifehouse tracks minus a few great Who live staples including Young Man Blues, My Generation and Naked Eye (Young Man Blues rivals the Live at Leeds version). A bootleg of this show has been released before although the quality is quite muddy and terrible compared to this version. Contrary to many Audiophile's beliefs, the sound quality is excellent for these shows. What I had heard is that too much noise reduciton had been used on the tracks leaving them sterile and unlistenable. This isn't the case and in fact, you can tell that the noise reduciton tool was under control as during the soft spots in the recording you can hear light hiss from the recording. This would not be an effect of noise reduction. I highly recommend this recording. <BR>     Although the Lifehouse tracks that aren't included would be a good addition to this set and would rightfully make this the ultimate version of Who's Next, I still have to give it 5stars as Who's Next is an amzing album and with the live disc, it's quite simply an offer that can't be refused.
B00005JMD3|5.0|This movie was your typical shoot 'em up blow 'em up. But it was a great shoot 'em up blow 'em up. Farrell was fantastic, as usual. Though some of his dialog wasn't the best Jackson was solid in his acting as ever. This was a fun movie.
B00005NB0H|3.0|I have always considered The Who to be the greatest live band ever. Live at Leeds is a sure testament to that claim. However, MCA continually attempts to do the album justice by re-mixing, re-mastering, and releasing it until they finally have the perfect version. Unfortunately, the newest incarnation, Live at Leeds: Deluxe Edition, is far from perfect and while claiming to have been restored to its full concert length, the Tommy tracks have been placed on one disc and the non-Tommy tracks placed on the other. This is quite bothersome as Tommy was originally played before several non-Tommy tracks. Although the track listing has been altered, this isn't the biggest problem. It seems that too much noise reduction has been used and the tracks have an almost sterile sound (The 1995 release of Live at Leeds has better sound quality than Deluxe Edition). I recommend this release only to hardcore Who fans that collect for specifically archival reasons and I suppose for the packaging as well (which is quite nice). Otherwise, as another reviewer has said, go out and find the bootleg of the Leeds show entitled Live At Leeds: Complete. LALC has the original running order from beginning to end, with no edits. Basically it's just the original tape with no alterations made. The sound isn't so bright but it's very honest, raw and powerful.  Here's my ratings:<br />LIVE AT LEEDS: DELUXE EDITION - *** (See above)<BR>LIVE AT LEEDS (1995 Remaster) - ***** (Excellent sound quality and expanded to 15 tracks!<BR>LIVE AT LEEDS COMPLETE - ***** (The original full length concert in brutal stereo! No edits!)

B00003CX9E|2.0|I have heard for years how innovative, groung breaking, if you only see one movie in your life...Wow! Does anyone in reality care or sympathize at all with any of these characters? &quot;Rosebud&quot; please - get a life, I could not wait for this clown to buy it. This is the kind of dribble that anyone would write for a college class titled Pretense 101. Give me Captain Ron any day.
B00005YUNY|5.0|great dvd high quality sound and picture.yes is still awesome. the orchestra was great. i really enjoyed watching them get into the music as much but not overpowering the band.more,please.concert u.s.a.please.keep rockin!!
B000068CNX|5.0|The Show runs human emotions at some fine scale that you don't even realize how fine and caring they are (unless you get to experience them first-hand as each episode progresses). I tend to get messed up, I laugh, I cry, I startle...The highlight of the season may well be the one with Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) and Ross (David Schwimmer) getting together; here as elsewhere even the most \\"life-threatening\\" or perhaps \\"serious\\" issues become resolvable with little human touch and gesture.
0446608955|3.0|This is a story of a young man who changes his entire world picture after his relationship with a sweet and loving classmate.<BR>Nicholas Sparks cleverly narrates the story in the first person, so the story is more realistic, and the character's feelings are not exaggerated, so thankfully there are no Harlequin elements here.<BR>Also, Sparks writes with a fast pace, so there are no boring details or passages here.<BR>The story is pretty simple really, and most readers already know what's about to happen.<BR>When it does happen, however, it seems that the author loses control.<BR>We don't really see the main character's range of feelings about what is happening, and there are some bits of cliche.<BR>It also annoyed me that the book had to come to a predictable, unoriginal and uninspired conclusion, which makes even the rest of the book seem different in a negative way (THIS was what it was heading to? Really!)<BR>So, read it if you want a nice romantic story and don't expect anything much.
0066620996|5.0|There are several aspects of this book that make it as good as it is:<br />* The book cites factual data, rather than ideas and opinions, as the basis for conclusions.  The examples are real world.<br />* The themes presented are universal in nature as they apply to running everything from a multi-billion dollar company to a small business.  It applies to virtually anyone who is in a supervisory role, regardless of industry or size of the institution.<br />* The writing style is very approachable.  Some books will focus on being profound rather than being understandable...this book is both profound AND understandable.<br />I find myself using the thougts and ideas repeatedly in my professional life.  It is the perfect starter book for a business leader as it provides a platform from which all other skills and knowledge should be based.  I have never read a better book on business
0060537639|2.0|The premise involving the unexplained completeness of the period's maps is interesting.  But, the author doesn't do himself any favors by citing incorrect facts as evidence.  Jade not known in pre-columbian Mexico?  That's ridiculous.  It was widely used in Mayan culture.  Taro must have been brought to Hawaii by the Chinese?  It was brought by the polynesian settlers of Hawaii.  Chinese speakers in 19th century California? Not a surprise, given there was heavy Chinese migration to California in the 19th Century.  Chinese DNA in people from Northern South America?  Chinese indentured labor was heavily imported to the region during the 19th century.  Pineapples in the Carribean?  The arawaks Columbus encountered in the Carribean had migrated from the region of South American pineapples come from and probably just brought them along.  Another strange thing is that the author mentions three maps that depict parts of the coast line of South America and says they all predate Columbus's travels - the problems is that none of them do, as is clearly shown in his own captions.
B00009W0U4|4.0|Its hard to say if i really liked it or not. But i guess a movie that stays with you must have some kind of redeeming value considering most dumb hollywood movies i stop thinking about as soon as i get to my car. Obviously it isnt for everyone. The movie starts off so intense and dizzying that you hope it changes soon. Luckily each scene gets mellower and more normal so its worth sticking with it. Of course the famous head bashing scene is very disturbing. i had to watch it 3 times just to see how they did it. amazing cgi work on that part. Of course they didnt really have to show it but the director wants to shock and make you uncomfortable. this movie is not for your everyday filmgoer that likes Legally blond and jim carrey movies.Its more for someone with an appreciation for some different, original [but not always pleasant] filmaking. It shows how actual camerawork and music can make you unsettled . I watched it last night and all day ive been scouring the net to read every possible thing about it[reviews, why it was made, actors opinions]. Be warned though, some of it can be brutal.
0743219619|5.0|The bodies of the murder victims keep piling up in this whodunit set in a nursing home on the coast of Dorset. The isolation lends to the aura of incipient terror that hovers over the scene, and more layers to the bottomless depths of Commander Adam Dalgliesh's character are revealed.<BR>One of James's best.
B000002JSP|5.0|Initially, I didn't make it a priority to listen to this album despite of my new found &quot;hardcore&quot; Zeppelin fan status. I had heard a lot of negative things about this album, so I didn't bother. Then, my friend had a copy, so I gave it a listen. First listen, I pretty much figured there was nothing good on the album besides Fool In The Rain. I listened again, and In The Evening, proved to be a definite stand-out (imo, the best song on the album), and again, All My Love seemed very heartfelt and emotional. I listened to South Bound Saurez and I'm Gonna Crawl, turning out to be pretty decent songs. Hot Dog to me is the only &quot;bad&quot; song on here. Then, Carouselambra. I gave that a few listens, not listening the whole way through, then considered it an ok song, but I gave it a few listens all the way through, and I now consider it awesome. That song was definitely a step forward for Zeppelin. Don't bash this album. They were experimenting, and imo, it worked, they just changed.
B00005YW4H|1.0|Oh my GOD how did this evil woman perform voodoo on the Grammy voters to get them to vote for her album? Seriously this music is so depressing. Not one song is uplifting. Everyone needs to wake up and listen to something with beats. I mean BIG BAND music is much better than this, much jazzier, more.. human. This album is like morphine. Don't waste your money on it, even when you find it in the bargain bin!
B00008LDPU|3.0|FINAL FLIGHT OF THE OSIRIS: ** out of 5<br />Brainless [fluff]. Starts with completely pointless foreplay scene, then sentinels attack, then the chick goes into the Matrix and does some unnecessary acrobatics, then everyone dies. The vocal actors sound as if they'll die from boredom. We didn't have to see this; the hint they made in \\"Reloaded\\" is enough for me. Two stars because, admittedly, it looked pretty cool.<br />SECOND RENAISSANCE PARTS 1 AND 2: both * out of 5<br />Attempt to make a solid background story to the enslavement of humans in the matrix turns out laughable, lost amidst the super-pretentious narrative of the shiny program chick with the English accent (you know, cuz it's more intellectual that way), and a plethora of self important biblical references (\\"Man made machine, and for a time, it was good...UGH!) Also gives us no reason to root for the humans, as they're a bunch of reactionary slobs with no sense of pity or remorse. Reign On, O Noble Machines!<br />KID'S STORY: ****1/2 out of 5<br />Finally, some good stuff! Fascinating animation and story about the annoying kid from \\"Reloaded.\\" Beautiful visuals and music.<br />PROGRAM: **1/2 out of 5<br />Nice swordfighting sequences, otherwise pretty ho-hum (And talk about a nasty trick...)<br />WORLD RECORD: ****1/2 out of 5<br />This seems to be the one all those cyber-pricks who can't stop raving about \\"Final Flight\\" have a problem with. Apparently \\"Abstract\\" isn't part of your vocabulary. Primitive but powerful, with a knockout ending; it's just that the agents look a little too much like vampires...<br />BEYOND: ***1/2 out of 5<br />A glitch in the Matrix as seen through kids' eyes. Engrossing, with some lovely imagery; haunting.<br />DETECTIVE STORY: *** out of 5<br />Excellent atmosphere, though a pedestrian story, from the makers of COWBOY BEBOP; nice \\"Beginning is the End\\" narration<br />MATRICULATED: ***** out of 5<br />Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant! Thought provoking story; beautiful, surreal visions; a perfect example of how stupid dialogue and narrative don't need to be incorporated to make a truly excellent piece of film.
0316666343|2.0|I agree that this 'novel' is completely overhyped (which is exactly the reason I winded up with it in the first place).  I never got past Chapter 7 or so -- with not even a clue nor desire to know how it ended.  I just can't understand why it keeps popping up in articles, magazines and the like.  It just seems to me that any work of literature that is lucky enough to get the right media attention can magically appear to be a work of art.  Not so in this case; I'm befuddled.
B00008BXJJ|3.0|Man, this is one of the mysteries of life... THe best hard rocking band of all times, with the worst singer of all times. THis was never so clear as in this majestic live compilation, LIVE.<br />Wait! Don´t get me wrong! Johnson is a great guy, a hard working and energetic singer that knows how to handle a crowd like few people do. I´m talking about his voice (or what is left of it).<br />Johnson realized a miracle. He succeeded in replacing the irreplaceable Bon Scott at a moment of real danger for AC/DC. HE did it bravely, with skill and merit. THe result was BACK IN BLACK, a lot of successfull tours, etc. The trouble is that, with the passing of time, that marvellous screaming power, that deep hoarse that has his particular trademark became sheer ugliness. His vocals were totally shot aorund the time of the release of FLY ON THE WALL. Only a deaf person can not hear it. But he kept going on and on, only worsening his voice.<br />In LIVE, his voice is terrible, obnoxious. Here comes that marvellous power chords, the strong drumming of Slade, the thundering guitars, the methodic precision of Williams´s bass, all that turned awful when Brian begins to sing; no metric, no rhythm to his singing; just an unbeliavable bad and ugly voice. I imagine this band with a better replacement for Scott (I mean, after FOR THOSE ABOUT TO ROCK - up till there Brian could sing).
B00003CWOL|4.0|This is my slightly edited film review, I was feeling kind of angsty at the time when I originally posted a review for this so...., well now I'm gonna tone down the angstyness(hmmm, not a real word is it?) a bit and try and make a bit more sense.<br />First I have to say, shut up to all you stupid uptight people criticising this film over its apparantly offensive content. It seemed to me like a very pro-faith movie if any of you actually bothered to watch it at all, it encourages people to at least come to their own ideas over God and religion, instead of either just blindly believing in God out of fear, or like most people, abandoning God completely due to Gods total irrellevance today in todays society. (No I don't mean that God is irrelevant, just that the church seems to make no effort to reach out and educate people about God and get them interested in real religion so to most of todays people, if they don't actually realise what God is, then why would God mean anything at all to them). I go to a christian church school and I spend a great deal of my spare time looking into philosophy - existentialism, So I do maintain an openmind and understand the messages this film is trying to convey to the viewer. (heres the ANGST - 'And personally I do not give a F**k if this film happens to offend anyone, if you don't agree with this film then fine, your opinion, but those of you who are so self-righteous that you refuse to even think about what this film is trying to convey to you, then, thats your problem.' - There is a genuine point in there somewhere though, it just hasn't been expressed very well - but basically you should at least try and view this film objectively and if your going to hate it, hate it for the excessive swearing, or poor acting, or plot or whatever, just not the religious aspect of this film - as it does essentially strike me as a pro-faith movie and is doing a hell of a lot more to get the average person interested in their spiritual selfs than the church is).<br />Now on to the actual film cast itself, overall In my opinion the film includes some very excellent and very witty dialogue. The cast are great, Kevin Smiths best film I think, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck are both very good, Alan Rickman, has given much better performances, but is still very respectable in his role, and as for Chris Rock, This is the only film I've ever seen him act well in, and in this role hes not just good, hes excellent. And of course, Jay and Silent Bob, amazing and hilarious again(wooooo).<br />I can understand why some people may not appreciate the excessive swearing, violence and sexually orientated jokes, but the again thats just Kevin Smiths style so, you either love it or you hate it..........
B00006AFUR|5.0|***** = Excellent<br />30STM has quickly become one of my all-time favorite cd's. On the surface, it can seem like your basic nu-metal album. But with repeated listens you discover that there's much more to this album than meets the eye.<br />First, the heavily distorted, drop tuned guitars and simple (but excellent) riffs is the first thing that gives you the impression of a nu-metal album. But that's where the similarities end. The rest of this album is a great mix of Pink Floyd's progressive rock sensabilities and Radiohead's electronic soundscapes. The lyrics never move beyond the outer space subjects, but if you carefully listen, a lot of the lyrics are metaphors.<br />The whole thing about this album is that it just begs the listener to dig deeper to find out what this album is really all about. You could be quick to dismiss this (especially on first listen) as a nu-metal space rock band. But like I said before, there's so much more to the album.<br />The album is much deeper musically than a lot of people will give it credit for. The drumming is oddly different than any I've ever heard. There's something very familiar and different about it. Despite the simplicity of the guitars, and the lack of any virtuoso licks, riffs, or solos, it still fits the music perfectly. The keyboard soundscapes is where this album really shines though. It adds such a dimension to the album that I really think pushes it beyond the average rock/metal bands of today. The singing is also fantastic. Leto sings with a passion that I haven't heard in rock music in what seems like forever. He shifts between a calm, soothing voice to an all out rock scream with ease and he does both excellently. Just check out the amazing &quot;Buddha for Mary&quot; where his voice slowly builds to a climax as he exclaims &quot;Mary was the type of girl, she always liked to fall...A....PAAAAAART!&quot; Right as the pounding electric guitar riff kicks in. One of the (many) awesome moments on the album.<br />One thing a lot of people pointed out is that the actor Jared Leto is the lead singer of the band. I didn't even know who Jared Leto was when I first bought the album. I must say that I admire the band for not capitalizing on Jared's movie career to make a quick buck, and I think it's really helped them gain a good reputation based solely on the music.<br />In closing i'll say that it's sad that this album will probably never achieve any kind of great success. You'll probably never see the videos on MTV or VH1 and will probably never hear the songs on the radio. But, as I've discovered, most great music is not found in mainstream radio. 30STM is just one glowing example of this. I have greatly enjoyed this album and I advise anyone who reads this review to go out and pick it up immediately and start spreading the word that rock has a new face and 30STM is it, whether the masses know it or not./>One thing a lot of people pointed out is that the actor Jared Leto is the lead singer of the band.

B00008H2LE|2.0|Well,do you know why everyone gets oh-so-excited about the new album?Ok,there are two categories of Meteora Lovers:a)The ones who liked Hybrid Theory b)the ones who didn't like it.It's simply because Meteora is a weaker,more poppish version of Hybrid Theory,so,it's suitable both for the Hybrid Theory lovers,and the non-rockers,who can't handle real rock and turn to bands like Sum 41,Blink 182 blah blah blah yadda yadda.And I've got nothing against them,but you've got to broaden your musical horizons if you're really interested in what you're listening to.<br />Linkin Park even used the same bridge for a song(Figure 0.9 has got the same bridge as By Myself in Hybrid Theory).They used similar intros with the first album and the same song structures(Somewhere I belong-In the end,Numb-Pushing Me Away,Easier to run-crawling---well,that was a clone went bad)And even similar videos(Numb-Crawling)<br />The lyrics are so childish it's just sad.\\"Don't turn your back on me,I won't be ignored\\"(Faint).Oh,please.It sounds like it's written by a 12-yr-old.I can write better lyrics.YOU can write better than that,whoever you are.The only good songs lyrically are probably Hit The Floor(it's dull and repeats itself too damn much musically though),From The Inside and,finally,Breaking the Habit,but it's got its bad points,too(\\"you all assume,I'm safe here in my room\\"-that's horrible,so juvenile it hurts).<br />The album length is disappointing.It's about 37 minutes.And then,everybody goes like\\"SO wut do u want meaningless crap and fillingz?\\".And the people who are saying all this stuff usually have an extremely short attention span,they can't listen to a 1-min guitar solo,typical nu-metal kids.<br />Yes,Brad,throw in some guitar solo,20 seconds long,it wouldn't hurt.SINCE YOU ARE SAYING THAT YOUR MUSIC IS ABOUT E-X-P-E-R-I-M-E-N-T-I-N-G.And why are you using the same song structures?There's a hell lot more to do with 2 vocalists.Originality is the key,and Hybrid Theory is still one of my favourite albums of all time.<br />I appreciate simple music and kinda simple lyrics,but I appreciate originality,too.Linkin Park has the potential to become a huge band.Why do they give everything up for the almighty dollar?<br />Finally,I'm not saying that you are not going to enjoy this album(but you should be able to ignore the lyrics).It's pretty catchy,Session,the instrumental track is worth listening to,and the Breaking The Habit orchestra is awesome(but drowned out,unfortunately).It's good music ot dance to,to tap your foot.And everyone enjoys some garbage...

B000025H0Q|3.0|Definitely above average, but honestly, I rarely listen to this one all the way through. As opposed to Pink Moon, which is drop-dead (pardon the phrase) beautiful, this one is diluted by studio musicians who don't seem to get the music. It just muddies the emotional essence of the songs. <br />Some are better than others; 'One of These Things First' is charming and graciously supported by the other musicians.<br />But 'Northern Sky' gets me every time. Here's a beautiful song, lovely lyrics, wonderful guitar -- and a young John Cale pissing all over it with the most obnoxiously inappropriate piano playing that seems to say 'look at me! look what i can do!'. Wonder what Nick was thinking when he heard it? Maybe the name recognition was important at the time. Or maybe Nick was stoned. At any rate, I would love to hear this track re-released unplugged ala Pink Moon and put on Time of No Reply II. (Compare 'Fly' here with the version on 'Time of No Reply'. What do you think?)<br />Buy Pink Moon and Time of No Reply, and listen to your local listening musicians as well!
B0000959N0|5.0|Yet, another Marvel movie.  This one came as a surprise.  Ben Affleck as the Daredevil superhero and Colin Farrell as the villian &quot;Bullseye&quot;.  If this film did not have Colin Farrell in it, I probably would not have  seen this film on DVD and there is an &quot;Easter Egg&quot; in the &quot;Beyond Hell's Kitchen&quot; frame. Just press the left arrow on your DVD remote.  I enjoyed this film better than the recent Spiderman and the first hour of The Hulk (2003). I was surprised to see David Keith (An Officer And A Gentleman), an actor I like, as the Daredevil's father and a boxer.  Good casting there.  Also an excellent cast of Joe Pantoliano and Paul Ben-Victor.  By the way, keep watching the end credits.  There is a funny clip of Colin Farrell as &quot;Bullseye&quot; that changes the story and the entire fate of his character.  This DVD package is a 2-Disc set.
B000099T2L|3.0|Everyone was really anticipating the release of Beyonce's solo album. I won't say that this was a disappointment, however, Beyonce could have done better. A lot of her songs are kind of lovey-dovey and slow and the topics of her songs never venture outside of the forever popular talk about boys. You can tell by listening to such songs as \\"Naughty Girl\\", \\"Hip Hop Star\\", and \\"Speechless\\" that Beyonce has matured a great deal. But you could already tell that by the way she acts and dresses in public. Honestly, I expected more from the album.

0385504209|1.0|Well-written mystery-thriller keeps you involved at the beginning. But it is historically misleading, often inaccurate. You put up with too much overt pagan proselytizing and are let down by an unsatisfying denouement to the mystery of &quot;the Grail.&quot; I advise against wasting your time on it. If you have sufficient knowledge of history of art or of religion, you will be aggravated. If you don't, you are likely to be deceived!

I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN.YOU MIGHT BE THINKING IT WILL BE A WAIST OF YOUR TIME BECAUSE IT WAS MADE IN THE 80'S, BUT ACTUALLY, THIS MOVIE IS BETTER THEN MOST MOVIES THEY MAKE TODAY, EVEN WITH ALL THE SPECIAL EFFECTS. THIS IS ONE MOVIE I RECEMEND TO EVERYONE. <BR>                                      L.B.S 4-LIFE
B00005JL3A|1.0|Yeah it's geared to teenie boppers... And that's who'll probably like it till they get to see some real zombie flicks! <br />In my top 5 worst movies ever. Borrows heavilly from other films, incoherent script, inept characterications, crummy CGI, crummy editing and camera... Just all around crummy! As far as an action movie centered around a female hero? I rather watch BarbWire! Yes it's that BAD! 'Nuff said!
0767817486|5.0|Hey! Forget about smuggling that hash out of Turkey and watch this movie. It's better to watch it than to be caught. Wow! It really made an impression on me as a young person. Really, instead of showing those stupid 'don't do drugs' commercials, show this movie more often instead. It was truly a smack in the face. It scared the pants off of me. I don't think I'll ever travel abroad.
B000089RVX|4.0|Evanescence is one of the coolest rock bands ever!!! Amy definitely can sing. She makes the songs come to life. The song &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; is what made the &quot;Daredevil&quot; soundtrack really worth listening to also. Here is an overview of what I think about all 11 songs.<br />1. Going Under- One word, WOW!!! A great opening song. Cool catchy lyrics also. 5/5<br />2. Bring Me To Life- This song really influenced me to start listening to this band. It has great lyrics sang by the talented Amy Lee. 5/5<br />3. Everybody's Fool- One of my favorite tracks I have to say. Some people may like it and some may not. 5/5<br />4. My Immortal- Now this is what I'm talking about. This song stands out by itself. It is very unique in its own ways. And once again Amy shines. Sounds great in the &quot;Daredevil&quot; soundtrack. 5/5<br />5. Haunted- The name says it all. Amy's voice sound very eerie and &quot;haunting&quot; in this song, although the lyrics are very short though. 4/5<br />6. Tourniquet- One of my favorites also. Although like some people say the lyrics may sound very weird at first. 4.5/5<br />7. Imaginary- It's an ok song. U just have to get used to it at first. 4/5<br />8. Taking Over Me- A really fun track to listen to. A very catchy chorus too. 4.5/5<br />9. Hello- I don't know why people call this song &quot;odd&quot; I mean I can understand it is a very slow song, but come on, u gotta listen to the lyrics to get used to it just like &quot;My Immortal.&quot; Amy's voice sounds very good in it too. 4.5/5<br />10. My Last Breath- One of my favorite songs also. I like the lyrics and the way Amy makes it sound very unique!!!<br />11. Whisper- I like the beginning but the end just doesn't work for me. I guess it was just a way of ending the album. 4/5<br />&quot; Fallen&quot; may be one of the best Rock Hard albums of the year. I just can't wait for another Evanescence CD. This one was very fun to listen to. But I was really looking forward for the actual title track &quot; Fallen&quot; to be in the album. Anyway enuf said, if ur a hard rock fan or any kind of music fan, get this. This should be in ur CD player. Listen to the songs and u will know what I'm talkin' about.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Thanks to Allan from Georgia for setting the record straight on this magnificient CD.  Musically, Radiohead is without equal.
0783223218|1.0|Okay, Bruce Willis is this master assassin who never leaves a trace.  Right?  When the gun maker he hires tries to keep his original blueprint, what does he do?   He kills the guy.  This leads the police to the victim's studio.  Guess what they find there?  That's right, the blueprints! And that's what helps them solve the crime he's planning to commit. Boy, this Jackal is a genius - isn't he?  Later in the movie he crosses from Canada into the US by boat.  Then he makes his getaway from the police using his van.  Only one problem, he left the van in Canada (or did he somehow carry it on the boat?)  It didn't seem like that big a boat.  Well, you get the idea.  The film asks you to believe your dealing with an evil genuis, too bad it was written by a dunce.
B000068FXX|5.0|I was surprised when I discovered some of the Supertramp albums had been remastered. I thought A@M did a great job on their material way back then. However, this being my favourite Supertramp album, I decided to buy it and compare to my origional copy. Well...the mid range is improved and the volume output has been increased but other than that I don't see much difference. I don't think I'd replace any more of their albums for the remastered copies. Would like to see a boxed set of their music.
1400031354|5.0|The mysteries of Precious Ramotswe, owner and head detective of the No. 1 Ladies'Detective Agency, are so steeped in the culture of Botswana, that even as she investigates genuine inquiries for her clients, one feels an almost mystic quality to her life.  The respect Mma Ramotswe finds in her interchange with an American woman searching for her long disappeared son, something as simple yet significant as a properly supported handshake, convinces her of the sincerity of the mother's quest.  And, roundabout, for that is the way of Mma, she faces the other complications of her life, including becoming engaged to Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni.  Through the disheartening experience she has with the belligerant and deceitful maid of Matekoni and her surprising discovery that he has adopted two children, one of whom is handicapped, without even discussing the matter, Mma faces her personal challenges while quietly pursuing the leads that finally bring her to a solution.<br />The characters in this second in the series of Precious Ramotswe novels are the key to enjoyment.  The corruptness that she encounters is wisely handled by a traditional African woman of not too many years.  Her interaction with her future husband and his new children, an acceptance and even joy, let the reader understand that she and he have a lot to share and are comfortable in doing so.  (Even though her need for a diamond ring surprised me, she still demonstrated great good sense in the final choice, a ring with a diamond from African soil.)  Their ability to live life to its gentle fullness, in a traditional Botswanan way, brings forth chuckles and smiles and an good-all-over feeling upon completing another book.  Indeed, each book with Precious Ramotswe in it is a gift, like the tears of the giraffe.
B00005QG9J|2.0|this cd is an excellent showcase of incubus' growth into the radio-friendly hit makers that epic records has wanted them to be since day one. as the band, they have always had a hand up on the rest of the metal-scene, in that they actually sounded like some of the disparate influences that they credit, and they play a legitimately natural blend of funk, metal and nether-worldly sounds. mike einzeiger stretches out his hands to include all sorts of jazz voicings and ethereal sounds that would never be heard on any pop album this side of ...well, exactly. the band grooves in fine form, though they still follow certain predispositions that have been in place over the ten years since nirvana came, namely sensitive verses punctuated by hemmoraging, overdriven choruses. <BR>however, the centerpiece of this effect-laden collage is brandon boyd. every song is loaded with his endearing, loaded image abstractions. one can almost smell the bare chested aroma wafting off of his unbuttoned persona. if you want an MTV video about crying while your girlfriend is on break, buy this album. boyd acts like he hasn't made a single important revelation since he was 18 and smoked pot and made it with his gal pal, documenting the entire ordeal in his own arcane form of writing. <BR>perhaps insight can be garnered from the rest of the group as their mastery of their respective instruments becomes more apparent. as for boyd, he's still trying to fix the broken atari in his emo-kid heart. maybe a few more catharsises and he'll get it.
B00005JMC6|5.0|This film has integrity.  The filmmakers portrayed the Maori culture with great respect and understanding.  From what I know, it is rare for movies today to have the depth and complexity that \\"Whale Rider\\" does, and to respect this, the humanity that is common to all of us.  \\"Whale Rider\\" is moving, not sentimental.  It is thought-provoking, without leaving one with the idea that she must forget as soon as the credits start rolling and the moviegoers make their way to their vehicles--forget about the lessons that she might have learned, or remembered, while watching the film.  What I mean to say is, this film has captured on celluloid what it is to be human, strong, and loving, without reverting immediately back to the now seemingly instinctive societal check on our hearts, our souls.  This movie inspires me to break free from any restraints that keep me from being true to myself, to others, to nature, and to God.  Not every person believes in God, but I do like to think that inside every person wants peace and never stops seeking the truth.  At least, I know that I wasn't the only person with tears streaming down tonight in the theater.

B0000AUHPG|5.0|I love this movie also, and am tremendously excited about it coming to dvd. However, please! Some of your overwrought fans should realize the best western ever made is the Duke's RED RIVER and a verrryy close second the Duke's THE SEARCHERS. WATCH THEM AGAIN OR THE FIRST TIME...and then decide . Having grown up watching westerns as a youngin' in the 1950's, both in vast numbers on t.v and in the movies, I feel absolutely qualified to make these statements.
B00005LC4B|5.0|...then you'll find much to love about Martin Scorsese's remake of film noir classic CAPE FEAR. There are some superb performances here, from a clearly-enjoying-himself Robert De Niro, whose terrifying portrayal of Max Cady remains a career high point, to Nick Nolte, Jessica Lange, Juliette Lewis (in her breakout performance), Illeana Douglas, Joe Don Baker (having fun in every scene), Sen. Fred Thompson, and the wonderful trio of Robert Mitchum, Martin Balsam and Gregory Peck (all of whom appeared in the 1962 original). <br />But beyond great acting, Scorsese assembled some of the greatest talents of 20th century moviemaking to aid him on this picture. Rather than try to top Bernard Herrman's original score (and who could? it's one of the scariest pieces of movie music in history!), Scorsese asked the great Elmer Bernstein to adapt and embellish, and the result is brilliant. His cinematographer is the legendary British director Freddie Francis, who helmed so many blood-curdling Hammer horror flicks in the Sixties and Seventies, and more recently known for his gorgeous cinematography on David Lynch's THE ELEPHANT MAN and THE STRAIGHT STORY. And as usual, Scorsese employs Thelma Schoonmaker (the &quot;editor's editor&quot;) with him in post-production, telling the story flawlessly. <br />Working from a ghoulish, morbidly funny script from Wesley Strick, Scorsese turns CAPE FEAR into a widescreen, Technicolor-hued tribute to early '60s melodramas, but adds a much darker sense of danger and suspense. De Niro's wronged convict comes after Nolte's family with a righteously Biblical cause of revenge and retribution, and proceeds to tear what little semblance of civility the family had for each other into shreds. CAPE FEAR is not a feel-good picture by any means, but it certainly is a wild ride, and a visceral experience provided by masters of the form. Recommended for fans of Alfred Hitchcock, Sergio Leone, and Sam Peckinpah.
B000002LQR|5.0|By far and away the best album they've made and superior to the chart-driven material they produce now. Both a rock and 90's classic, they will never produce better. There are no fillers on this album, no tracks you could skip on. Endlessly enjoyable and listenable, BSSM possesses depth far beyond that of most modern rock albums. A tremendous acheivement in the Chili's musicality and in Rick Rubin's production, this album is the pinnacle of their career.
B00006LFGD|5.0|I love this CD!!  I have never been a Barbra fan, but I play this all the time and, the more I play it, the better I like it.  19 songs ...I know I will wear it out.  I now have sent it to two of my friends as gifts.
B00006879E|5.0|AWESOME CD!  Very laid back and funky.  LOTS OF SOUL.<BR>Amazing tunes, lyrics, instrumentation and musicianship,<BR>loved it!
B00008WT5E|5.0|Powerage is a terrific album. All of AC/DC's Bon Scott era records are mandatory.......but this one is especially great. Released right when they were gaining popularity in the US (yes, AC/DC DID have popularity BEFORE &quot;Back In Black&quot;).<BR>Only one disappointment. This re-issue does not contain ANY of the original mixes from the first European release and it omits &quot;Cold Hearted Man&quot; (one of the best Bon Scott era tunes yet never released in the US). A great album none the less but c'mon Malcolm, release some rarities over here in the US!!!!
6302859204|5.0|A deceptively powerful movie. As others have rightly said, the abduction scenes and the onboard experimentation scenes above all are chillingly believable. Yet for me, the key element that makes this a very convincing account of a genuine alien abduction, is the way the superb Sweeney and Patrick portray their characters.<br />The men act like Vietnam Vets who are suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. They shared a common traumatic experience, like the men and women who served in Nam. As with Vietnam Syndrome, people who have never been through the experience could never duplicate or understand what they went through. Thus they became alienated from the community.<br />The footnote which confirms that the men re-took PolyGraph tests that indicated that they had been telling the truth, speaks for itself.
B0000028RR|5.0|With such empowering titles as 'Freedom' and 'Take the Power Back', it is not hard to see through the riddles, similes and metaphors of Zack DeLaRocha's lyrics. Rage Against the Machines' first studio recorded album, 'Rage Against the Machine' offers a thousand anti-political statements and conspiracy theories ('Freedom'). When not contemplating over the corrupt government in Mexico and the theft of Mexican sovereignity over California, DeLaRocha's gruff funky rock-rapping style combined with the immense talent of guitarist Tom Morello, the almost-tribal aspects of Brad Wilk on the skins and Timmy C. on bass, Rage Against the Machine liberate many and disappointed few. Produced by GGGarth (who also produced Mudvayne's life-altering 'L.D.50') and co-produced by the band members themselves, 'Rage Against...' has a raw quality which unfortunately has only been captured by their first two albums('Evil Empire') and live performances. I would definitely recommend 'Rage Against...' to anyone as a welcomed addition to any multi-genre'd collection.
B00009L1TA|2.0|this movie had the potential to be a great movie. it failed. the plot seems great but it's just average for a murder mystery. i liked it up until the ending and then i was like what the hell just happenned. i don't get it.
B000002KIK|5.0|This album is relatively unknown, but any diehard fans of the Ozzy years must have it to round out their collection.  There is a lot of variety, and interesting songs.  I really like this album and I wish I had found it sooner.  Don't start your Sabbath journey here, but get here eventually.
B00006F7S4|5.0|Beck supposedly set out to make this album a rollicking good time, because at the time there was a lack of good rock bands. Along the way, the garage revolution occured, and Mr. Hansen broke up with his long-time girlfriend. So instead he set to work on making the most heart-wrenching and personal breakup album since Bob Dylan's &quot;Blood on the Tracks.&quot; Hooking up again with whiz producer Nigel Godrich, Beck laces his acoustic laments with soft electronic ambience and amazes us again. It's unfortunate that Beck had to obviously suffer such heartbreak to attain such a wonderful album, but clearly his loss was our gain.
B0000646UN|3.0|This is an okay movie.  It tells the extremely dramatic story of Finnland's heroic resistance against the Soviet invasion of 1939 (this, by the way, is one of the things that the Russians would like you to forget about when they assert that they essentially won World War II on their own).<br />Anyway, the combat scenes are impressive for a film made in 1989.  However, unless you speak Finnish, you're likely to get bored and start pressing the fast forward buttton when Talvisota gives you a series of verbose scenes at the beginning that last almost a half hour.  There are several shorter (mercifully) interruptions punctuating the combat.<br />I've often wondered why Hollywood has never made a film about the brave fight that the Finns put up against the Russians.  It would seem to me that the story would have the same appeal that &quot;Braveheart&quot; did.  But then, I'm not a Hollywood producer.<br />The bottom line:  If you can't rent it, I'd recommend buying it used (like I did).  It simply isn't worth 45 dollars brand new.
B00006RU5B|1.0|Slow, grinding, bloodless, painful...just a few words that popped into my head as I attempted over and over to finish this monstrosity of an album. It's not to say I wasn't excited for this album: I was a huge fan of Rage and a more casual listener of Soundgarden. I figured the album should be interesting at least, if nothing brilliant; turns out I was very wrong.<br />When Zack de la Rocha left Rage, he took everything with him, and that includes the fiery music and message. Below his impassioned lyrics, the music was a churning, dangerous sea of volatile emotions that made Rage such a wonderful and meaningful band. Now they're just trudging through sludgy nu-metal riffs that go nowhere. This would appeal to any bonehead who thinks Nickelback is the greatest band of the decade. Is this how they sounded with Zack, if you took his vocals out of the mix? It wasn't this bad then. Tom Morello's solos, once so innovative, seem merely tacked on here: what's the point of them? Chris Cornell screams in a pale, croaky imitation of his past power about who-cares what, and the guitar solos come in unheralded, with no purpose to them, to make you wince further. The mighty rhythm of Brad and Tim, perfected on &quot;Battle of LA&quot;, plods aimlessly along, lost in its own sea of muddle.<br />It's hard to see how two of the best bands of the 90s would come together and make an album that could have come from the worst of the 70s power dinosaurs. Horribly disappointing, it only throws their past triumphs into sharper relief.
0451207521|4.0|Ken Follett has been one of my favourites since the age of 12. I once read an interview on him in which he said something along the lines of, \\"My aim in constructing sentences is to make the sentence utterly easy to understand...I've failed dreadfully if you have to read a sentence twice to figure out what I meant.\\"<BR>That is exactly how this book works. It's so easy and fun to read...especially if you're a woman who has always wanted some adventure in her life =)<BR>The story takes place during WW2 (like most of Follett's books) and concentrates on the French resistance and British spies working in France. <BR>Felicity \\"Flick\\" Clairet is the main character. She's one of the British spies risking her life to bomb German Nazi headquarters. Her husband, who she loved desperately, stabbed her in the back and screwed up a mission.

B00006BTCA|5.0|People will read too much into Interpol being compared to Joy Division or the Cure, but I listened to this album as the sound of young band asserting their own identity on their debut album. In the process I found a brilliant album that showcases a barrel full of promise for these talented young artists from New York. A refreshing change of pace from insipid lyrics from other rock bands who are content to rhyme &quot;sun&quot; with &quot;fun&quot; or other generica like that. A smart, assured and enjoyable debut, the sky's the limit for Interpol. A five-star debut on all levels.
B000092ZYX|4.0|How do you figure that one?  Clear Channel is involved in some of the shows on the current tour.
B00006LLNU|3.0|...that Sigur Ros could ever top their untouchable masterpiece &quot;Agaetis Byrjun&quot;. While this album isn't a complete wreck, it still pales in comparison to their sophomore album. What I found was lacking in this album was not just song names, or even an actual title, but the roller-coaster of emotions found in &quot;AB&quot;. Everytime I heard this album, it just melted away in a 72-minute long bland daze, with no discernible melodies and the same 15 syllables (curiously alike to the ones used in &quot;AB&quot;) repeated over and over in Hopelandish.<BR>Every now and then I listen to it to try to salvage it, and there is no doubt that it is a pretty album, but it's just too pretty. Stick with &quot;Agaetis Byrjun&quot;, you can't go wrong with it.
0385504209|1.0|For the time-challenged, here is the short version of this review:<br />Highs: the French sentences are correctly spelled.<br />Lows: everything else.<br />Want a more complete picture? Read on, but don't say I didn't warn you.<br />The basic premise of \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is this: an American expert on religious symbology uncovers a conspiracy to eliminate the descendants of Mary Magdalene, who was Jesus Christ's wife. He is aided by a French cryptologist, who happens to be the recent victim's granddaughter, while being chased around by the French police and, naturally, the Catholic Church's hitman. Hero and heroine go through an esoteric version of a treasure hunt involving, more of less in this order: a message written in blood, another message written in invisible ink, a permutation of the Fibonacci sequence, a safe deposit box key, a box with a rose on its lid and a white cylinder with five coded sections inside, an inverted message (in English, despite having been written by a Frenchman, for his French granddaughter), a tomb in London, a smaller cylinder, presumably with a papyrus inside, and here I stop to avoid spoiling the non-climax.<br />Needless to say, this by itself would not carry the story very far but, wait, there's more: did I mention the Catholic Church is dead set against our heroes ever discovering its dirty secret, and therefore they're throwing in their best and brightest to thwart them? Namely: a self-flagellating, gigantic albino with an IQ of around 20, who seems to be perpetually on crack, plus a jet-set American bishop connected with a mysterious \\"Teacher\\" (whom I won't reveal, either, lest I spoil this component of the final non-climax as well). And that's it. No Sicilian Mafia, no Spanish Inquisition, no Swiss Guard-sorry, wrong again: there's the French police, perpetually two steps behind everyone else in the story, but speaking lots of correctly spelled French (unlike the Spanish in the book).<br />Characters: you've probably guessed it. Robert Langdom, the hero, is a Harvard version of Indiana Jones. He's an expert in religion, maybe because of his belief that religion is bad for people. At the end, he hasn't changed one iota. Sophie Neveu is the granddaughter of the previous Grand Master of the \\"Priory of Sion,\\" and this fact is key, because she keeps remembering things her granddad had told her long ago so she could solve the mystery. We're told she's a brilliant cryptologist but her memory, however, is so weak that the necessary clues only come back after pages and pages of mental jogging. As to the villains, I've already mentioned the albino and the bishop; the French police inspector is very French (as in \\"Casablanca,\\" but without the jokes), which defines him completely. There's also an English scholar, Sir Leigh Teabing, who hides a terrible secret behind his facile demeanor. This secret is definitely not his deep aversion to the Catholic Church, which he expostulates through lengthy lectures.<br />Plotwise, the book follows a treasure hunt structure, with chapters interspersed to show how the villains are getting closer to the heroes. At some point, the albino catches up with them but they disable him easily despite having no weapons (this sort of thing happens again in the non-climax scene, involving another villain that I won't mention). This and the \\"anima ex machina\\" interventions by the dead grandfather, who always had the right clue to give but Sophie had somehow forgotten until that very moment, make for very dull reading. Here is a typical page: Langdon and Sophie are stumped by the most recent clue. They talk back and forth for many pages. Then Langdon reveals a piece of the ongoing Catholic conspiracy against the defenders of truth and freedom, and then Sophie remembers something her grandfather had once told her, which leads them to the next clue after maybe using a bit of kindergarten-level cryptography. Rinse. Repeat.<br />As for setting, the whole book has a luscious white-room feel, where the only locations described in any detail are the albino's hideouts. Even street addresses are given for those (they are, apparently, Opus Dei centers, whom anyone can find in a phonebook). After he goes inside, accuracy goes out the window, but what do readers know? Depictions of the albino's self-flagellations are presented at the start, probably to hook the reader, but these too seem taken from medieval stories rather than modern-day practices of corporal mortification. There are lectures on the Priory of Sion and Church's big conspiracy against them, but you can get more depth from a Web search for a fraction of the cost, and I suspect this is precisely all the author did.<br />Style? Every problem imaginable can be found: non-simultaneous present-participle constructions, chopped-up, stilted yet mundane dialog, adverbs galore. It reads quickly, but I suspect this is mainly because you end up skipping a lot so your mind doesn't shut down. All of the above recommends a zero-star rating which, hopefully, Amazon.com will consider after this experience.<br />So, is there something going for \\"The Da Vinci Code\\"? Why is it selling so well? Aside from the fact that many best-sellers are manufactured by marketing devices, the most memorable trait of this novel is its pervasive, corrosive attack on the Catholic Church, presented as the ultimate villain, eternal source of slavery, war, ignorance, and everything else bad that's ever happened, and this is probably why so many find it appealing (I find it hard to believe it's because of its elementary plot and shoddy writing). If wallowing in this stuff is what you like, go ahead and read \\"The Da Vinci Code.\\" It may be boring otherwise, but you'll get your kicks.e-room feel, where the only locations described in any detail are the albino's hideouts.

B000069AUI|5.0|The last great sophomore album was from our dear Radiohead: now Coldplay can step into that pantheon with this fully-fleshed, wonderfully realized and just plain great album.<BR>Think &quot;Parachutes&quot; with a shot of adrenaline. Think &quot;Yellow&quot; with more maturity.  Think of a band stepping out of their predecessors' shadows into their own light. &quot;A Rush of Blood...&quot; contained the best collection of songs your money could get in 2002, and their tour was one of the best of the year.<br />Politik: a rousing opener that sets the stage for the triumphs that follow. A<BR>In My Place: a solid single that will be a future classic. Somewhat dampened by overplay. A-<BR>God Put a Smile Upon Your Face: actually, that was Coldplay. A<BR>The Scientist: one of the best rock ballads in years. A+<BR>Clocks: another future classic, very memorable piano riff. A<BR>Daylight: a slowly-building song, it nevertheless sounds very much like its title. A-<BR>Green Eyes: a little less formed, one of the weaker songs. B+<BR>Warning Sign: very touching, one of the best on the album. A+<BR>A Whisper: another rouser, but it doesn't really go anywhere. A-<BR>Rush of Blood to the Head: absolutely fantastic, sheer poetry in the chorus. A+<BR>Amsterdam: similar to &quot;Scientist&quot;, a very haunting and lyrical way to end a supreme album. A+<br />You don't need to take my word for it, but if you like smart, touching music that means something, you can't do much better than this future classic.
0684833395|5.0|This is one of the greatest novels written in the 20th Century. Heller's sense of absurdity and pacing is remarkable. His understanding of the double standards created by greed and dishonesty give depth and meaning to a world hungry for answers. His style is not lost on a new generation of writers: David Sedaris for one has mastered the wit of satire. A new writer, John Orozco in his DELANO, pays tribute to Heller with rapid fire dialogues that are reminiscent of CATCH-22. These satires are valuble in exposing hypocrisy.
0156027321|1.0|I will get right to the point -- to me, reading this novel was like reading a transcript of someone's nightmare. Although I usually agree with critics, I do not see what all of the commotion is concerning Life of Pi. I finished reading within three days, only because it really bothers me not to finish something I started... and maybe I had some hope that the book would turn out to be worth the money I spent on the hardcover version. I would not recommend this novel to anyone, in fact, I would warn them against it!!
0002558122|5.0|I am one of the odd students of my High School. I decided to read Frank McCourt's work in the middle of my sophmore year. The book displayed a life of hardships through not only a child's eyes,but an adults as well. Thus, making one be appreciative for the life they have, despite they may think how rotten it may be in the current time period. Because.. things can always get worse. This is truly a real life verison of such scenarios as a person could think in back of their minds on how their life would be if this had happened.<br />I often feel happy that Mr. McCourt was allowed to reach his dream of becoming a writer,despite how many obstacles he had overcame in his lifetime. He held his dream tight of coming to America and he achieved it. As my grandfather always tells me, &quot; My dear, as long as you believe in something. Then there is no limit on how far you will fly to achieve it. Regardless, what dark storms may lie ahead&quot;.

B00004T8RK|3.0|By the year 2000 newer younger bands such as Creed had taken the spotlight and for some Pearl Jam had become a distant memory. Like most fans I eagerly awaited this album and was shocked when I didn't like it. Fast forward 3 plus years and I have grown to appreciate and even like this album but not nearly as much as their earlier efforts. Even the songs that rock don't sound as good as those from their previous albums. Overall this is a good album and better than what many bands could come up with. But compared to Pearl Jam of old it is not nearly as good. One of the reasons I grew to like these songs is from hearing them live and from the official bootlegs. In concert these songs take on a new life and energy and are clearly good songs. This album requires patience and is an acquired tasted.<br />1. Breakerfall 7/10 Good opening song but doesn't grab you like other album openers they've had before.<br />2. God's Dice 7/10 Another decent rocking song.<br />3. Evacuation 7/10 Good rock song but sort of boring.<br />4. Light Years 8/10 Midtempo song that sounds good, but really shines on their live albums.<br />5. Nothing as it Seems 8/10 Slow bluesy song. Good guitar work.<br />6. Thin Air 7/10 Slow acoustic song not as good as earlier work.<br />7. Insignificance 8/10 The best song on the album. This song really shines live.<br />8. Of the Girl 6/10 Another slow acoustic song that isn't bad but isn't great.<br />9. Grievance 8/10 They speed things up again to good effect.<br />10. Rival 6/10 Starts with pig noises then turns into average slow song.<br />11. Sleight of Hand 6/10 Another slow song that doesn't really stick with you.<br />12. Soon Forget 8/10 Surprisingly this song works even though it is just Eddie and a ukelelle.<br />13. Parting Ways 6/10 Another slow song which doesn't close the album with much energy.<br />Bottom line none of their rocking songs hold up well to other album rockers. Likewise the slow songs don't hold up well to songs like Release or Indifference from previous albums. Most of these songs are forgetable even after multiple listens and don't stick with you like their old songs. Over all this is a good album but casual finds of Pearl Jam might like their older work better. Also I do suggest to geting their many concert CD's to hear these songs really come alive.
B00009V7T2|5.0|Eriartaka has that kind of refrain, full with pain and hurt, that you'll need to hear over and over again, just amazing, yet not whiny like radiohaed or a lot of bands that are around these days.<br />it's so refreshing to hear a musically extremely skilled band (unlike the white stripes) that gets attention without hype.<br />the only band that i can think of that comes close to their style is VOIVOD, still totally different, in means of harmony, but very alike in being totally unpredictable and &quot;whacko&quot; at times.<br />Anyway, this is the record very many people have been craving for without knowing it. A band, uniqe, honest, surprising!!<BR>A new sound on the horizon, finally!!!!<br />throw your teenie heartbreak &quot;alternative&quot; bands away and go buy!! now!!
B00005JKHZ|5.0|What more could you want from a movie?? Car chases! Explosions! Nudity! Oh My!! Kowalski (Barry Neuman) is the ultimate anti-hero in this tale of rebellion for no apparent reason. The blind, mysterious \\"Super Soul (The Late-Great Cleavon Little)\\" is Kowalski's guiding light and biggest fan. Roaring through the desert on speed (in that car, that beautiful car), Kowalski becomes public enemy number one to hordes of cops, while becoming a folk hero to the outcasts who embrace him. No movie has better chase scenes! No movie has a weirder, more apocolyptic ending! You'll be rootin' for the \\"bad guys\\". A must see for all adrenaline freaks like me...
B00004Y6RO|4.0|I'll start off buy saying I like tons of different types of music, except rap, country and oldies, and I have tons of cds.  I listen groups from Slayer, Chemical Brothers, Juno Reactor, ATB, Tristania, Theatre of Tragedy, you get the picture.  Most of my music however is Metal.  I really like to listen to music that is different and stands out, Slipknot deffinitly fits that catagory.  <br />As long as you enjoy any heavy music then I suggest you give Slipknot a try.  The only complaint I have with them is the constant swearing that is why I took off a star.  The swearing doesn't bother me at all but I can see where a lot of people would find it offensive.  <br />If you listen to and enjoy Slipknot I suggest you try Mushroomhead.  I like them more than Slipknot and they rarely  swear in their music.
B00000JGEI|5.0|Terminator 2 is a rise above most of the other action movies that have been filmed in the past two decades.  And it's got more than special effects to brag.<BR>Unlike a lot of other action flicks of the modern age, this film combines special effects, actions, and good drama to the fore front of this movie.  Most action films will depend on its indulgence and concentrational value of their special effects and action sequences to sell tickets and encourage rentals.  Not T2.  <BR>Oh it has its action, its special effects which will keep you on the edge of your seat.  But it has even more to offer than just that.  A great storyline.<BR>In the first movie, Arnold was the villain robot out to murder Sarah Connor.  Now he returns as the good robot who is ordered to protect John Connor from an assassin robot.  The assassin robot played by Patrick is T-1000 a highly advanced machine that is made of liquid metal.  Sounds cool huh?  Hamilton returns as Sarah Connor and is kind of on the deep end, on the edge of going berserk, very different than her character in the first film.  But this is great character development and acting.  If you knew that the world was going to end wouldn't you be a bit edgy?  Exacto Mundo.<br />What I like the best out of this film, is the growth of John and the Terminator together.  The Terminator will pick up certain principles and morals during the film, becoming sort of human because of the influence of John.  I thought this was superb, it gives a dramatic and emotional element to this film.<br />Without the bonding of the characters around each other, this film would be nothing more but a waste of great action sequences, which a lot of action films seem to do.  You need a human element in a storyline as well as a point to why it's being told.  A point, meaning what makes this story so entertaining, what is this film about?  And T2 has an easy answer to that question.  Which you'll learn later when you see it.<br />If you haven't seen it, see it.You'll like it.<br />Grade: A
0385504209|5.0|Dan Brown's writing is grabbing, intruding, and entertaining to the end of this book. I definitely plan on buying copies of this book as gifts for friends and family. The Da Vinci Code is an intelligent and coherent thriller.
0385720920|4.0|Choke was the third novel I have read by Chuck Palahniuk, and once again I was not disappointed (until I finished and found myself wanting to read on!). Palahniuk's extra-ordinary insight into the ridiculousness of today's society continues to make me smile and shake my head in awe at the accuracy with which he picks apart the most minute idiosyncrisies of ourselves. <BR>The book reads almost like a candid journal- as if the narrator just sat down and told his story start to finish exactly how it came into his mind. This style is (in my opinion) brilliantly mastered by Palahniuk in this novel as well as in Fight Club and Survivor. Palahniuk is one of the few authors who can convince me that the narrator is telling the story- rather than the author trying to fabricate a new persona and going back and revising and changing details. Palahniuk really seems to &quot;know&quot; his characters- the novel reads as though he has absolute confidence in what his characters would do, as opposed to some novels in whic the author seems to hold back and play it safe with regards to the situations the characters are placed into. Palahniuk pushes his characters to the limits and is not afraid to take risks making his writing thoroughly enjoyable and delectable. I look forward to reading more of Palahniuk's work!<BR>Highly recommended!
B00008GKEG|5.0|In various magazines, this collection always seems to get dinged for one reason or another.<br />Those &quot;experts&quot; are full of you know what.<br />This is an amazing look at the band that not only changed pop music, but the world. There are a million wonderful moments to point out, but every individual who watches these will have a different favorite.<br />However, I will share one of mine. Time and time again, you will be absolutely blown away by how musically tight this group was in concert, despite not even being able to hear themselves play, let alone think.<br />For fans of any kind of modern music, this is essential.
B00006RIO7|5.0|This is the CD that taught me to love jazz!! The songs are all super (every track is great!) and all the cast have beautiful strong voices. Since buying this CD my parents and 2 siblings have also purchased copies (after repeatedly borrowing mine!) <BR>Highly recommended!
B000001XN2|5.0|If you can get the DG version, you'll find it is superb mono sound. DG remastering (&amp; RCA) is always the best. Too bad Decca doesn't release radio recordings.
B0000A129N|5.0|I will say upfront that I have only heard one song on this album, and that is &quot;Wildest Dreams.&quot;  When I first heard it on the radio, I thought this was some vintage previously unreleased Maiden that was part of some new compilation album.  But when I heard that this song is new, my mouth dropped.  I was blown away by the sound.   Music this good CAN'T be from 2003, can it?  This sounds like it is old school, true to their roots 80's style Maiden.  Maiden, unlike Metallica, at least adheres to the philosophy that if their ain't nothing &quot;broke&quot; with your music, DON'T FIX IT.  Unlike Metallica who went downhill after the black album in their sorry attempt to become &quot;mainstream,&quot; Maiden sounds as good as ever.  I can't wait to hear the other songs.
B00008NRLX|5.0|I stumbled across the Jayhawks by mistake when a friend played Rainy Day Music in her car and I immediately fell in love with the intelligent lyrics and the catchy music, not to mention the beautiful harmonizing.  Few albums have hooked me so quickly, on the first listen, but each song is perfect, conveying and evoking different emotions, of sadness, of joy, of optimism and hope.  Beautifully reminiscent of Traveling Wilburys in the music, Marcy Playground in the blending of voices, and even the Beatles for overall ambience.  Each song sounds vaguely familiar but in a comforting way.  If you are looking for an album to move you, that you will remember a year or a decade from now, get this haunting and moving CD.  What a rush.
B00008H2LB|5.0|This album is awesome! PERIOD!!! If you don't have it. GET IT! Thats all I gotta say. The album speaks for itself.
B00005JKN9|5.0|I can't help but wince at all the people out there who trash Scorsese's film because it makes them feel big inside. I can't say that it feels that 20 years of work have gone into this, because it hasn't and that's a mere exaggeration regardless, because I know Scorsese hasn't been working on it that long. But what he ended up with...is an epic masterpiece that pulls no punches and forces people to take it seriously. I'm sorry all the pretentious film snobs with attention spans that don't like anything faster then L'Avventura. Scorsese delivers another great film, and it should have won most of those 10 Oscar nominations.
B00006L3S3|5.0|This CD is excellent. Well worth my money. A must buy.

B00004VVNB|5.0|Of the many great Science Fiction movies that were released in the seventies, \\"Logan's Run\\" can definitely be counted as being among the best of them.  There have been so many Science Fiction movies and novels over the years that depict either a bright or a not so bright future for humanity and many of them could've been cut right from a \\"cookie cutter,\\" being the same tired story over and over yet \\"Logan's Run\\" stands out as being brilliantly different from the rest.  <br />I vividly remember going to see this brilliant film at seven or eight years of age and having been totally enamored with the overall theme.  A few years later, I read \\"Logan's Run,\\" \\"Logan's World\\" and \\"Logan's Search\\" by William F. Nolan and George Clayton Johnson, all of which not only served to further this brilliant story but turned it into an extraordinary Science Fiction trilogy!<br />Michael York, Richard Jordan and Jenny Agutter all perform superbly in this silver screen classic!  Between the films overall success, the exceptional actors and the demand for a sequel, I'm quite surprised one never followed.<br />If one were to make the comparison between \\"Logan's Run\\" and other big budget, extraordinary Science Fiction films of the seventies, like \\"Star Wars you could definitely say that it holds its own quite well.<br />The premise:<br />Imagine a future some two hundred years down the road where most of humanity has been wiped out leaving the remainder to build and live in domes with limited resources and the measures that would be taken to continue survival.  That is the \\"basic\\" premise behind \\"Logan's Run.\\"  The more explicit premise is human nature at its need to expand beyond where it's at and its need to question everything.<br />In \\"Logan's Run,\\" the society of the future has a need to limit the number of people due to limited resources, therefore when born; everyone has a life crystal placed in the palm of their hand.  Run by the domes central computer, this life crystal goes through stages based on its owner's hand.  At certain ages it changes colors.  Upon nearing the owners thirtieth birthday it starts blinking, meaning it's nearly time for renewal.  Renewal being when the respective thirty year old human is blown up quite spectacularly in a huge ceremony.  For those that do not wish to end their lives, they become runners who are chased down by \\"Sandmen.\\"  It is the job of the Sandmen to track down runners, wherever they may go, and kill them.<br />Logan, who is one of the Sandmen does his job perfectly, tracking down a runner and kills him.   After doing so, he removes the runner's possessions; among them is an Anck, which he does not yet know what it is.  The next day, when he attempts to turn in the runner's possessions, the domes central computer asks him if he knows what the Anck is, which of course he doesn't.  The central computer then effectively turns him into a runner by adding several years to his life clock and orders him to determine what and where \\"Sanctuary\\" is.  Sanctuary is the mythical place where runners are trying to run to.  What follows is nothing less than one of the best Science Fiction films of the seventies!<br />I highly recommend this film to any and all fans of the genre!  {ssintrepid}<br />Special Features:<br />- Feature Length commentary by Michael York, Director Michael Anderson and costume designer Bill Thomas.<BR>- Behind The Scenes documentary - A Look into the 23rd Century<BR>- Remastered soundtrack in Dolby Digital 5.1<BR>- Theatrical Trailer
B000002J03|3.0|The only good songs on this album are \\"Whole Lotta Love,\\" \\"What is and What Should Never Be,\\" which are both on the EARLY DAYS compilation, \\"Moby Dick,\\" and the \\"Heartbreaker\\"/\\"Living Loving Maid\\" medley. <BR>\\"Moby Dick\\" has a three-minute drum solo by drummer John Bonham. <BR>\\"Heartbreaker\\" ends suddenly and goes right into \\"Living Loving Maid\\" with only a half-second of silence. <BR>These things I mentioned make the album a little more interesting, but as a whole, the songs aren't very great.
B000002JB8|5.0|Really, I've had this album for several years now. Everynight I play it when I go sleep.  Dreamy and seclusive, it lulls me to my far away secretive place near my mystic ocean. Highly recommended.
B00009MGQL|5.0|Just got my copy of this album today, and boy am I a happy camper!  I've been a Jeff Beck fan since 1980, and &quot;Jeff&quot; is one of his best.  You'd think the guy--after 40 years on the scene--would be content to go through the motions with his hits from the past.  Wrong!  This album charges ahead from the git-go and really shows that Jeff Beck is just as relevant as ever.  How old's the guy anyway?  55-ish, or more?  He plays with the fire of someone less than half his age.  <br />Contrasting with so many of the hard-driving tracks are some entrancing, truly beautiful numbers, again so typical of the many things Jeff Beck does so well.<br />If you're a Jeff Beck fan, you probably already have &quot;Jeff&quot;.  If you're not familiar with Jeff Beck, but enjoy innovative rock guitar, this album would be a great introduction.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This is Christina's best album so far. I love all of the songs and I can relate to a few of them. These songs are very personal and filled with lots of emotion.

B0000BWVCM|5.0|This was a great movie and will undoubtably make a great DVD. It had some great fight scenes like Wolverine vs. Deathstrike, and Magneto's escape, etc. It is strongly recommended for any X-Men fan to buy it.
1400034779|2.0|I probably shouldn't even contribute since I only read about 25 pages of this, but I just couldn't &quot;get into&quot; this book because I found the author's writing style self-consciously quaint (maybe &quot;twee&quot; is the right word), boring, and overall irritating.  It's a pet peeve of mine when an author refers to a character by his full name EVERY SINGLE TIME he mentions the character -- for example, &quot;Mr. J.M.B. Matekoni did this.  Then Mr. J.M.B. Matekoni did that.  Then Mma. Ramotswe asked Mr. J.M.B. Matekoni to do this for her...&quot;  Tedious!  Is there some literary value to that endless repetition that I'm not aware of?
B000088E6D|5.0|I am not one to ever comment on singers.  With Michael Buble I needed to write in - my first Amazon review in seven years.   This young man brought me to tears especially with \\"That's All\\".  He is reminiscent of a gentler era - his is classy and has of the voice of an angel.
0385504209|5.0|This is really a great book. The plot explores some controversial but intriguing theories (originally published in \\"Holy Blood, Holy Grail\\") about Jesus and various secret societies. It's a fun thriller made compulsively readable by Dan Brown's particular style. I'm not surprised that it is such a huge bestseller because there's so much that will appeal to such a wide variety of people (mystery lovers, people who like to read about alternative religious theories, conspiracy theorists). My advice is to read this book - I've recommended it to several people and every one of them has loved it.<br />You might also be interested to know that there is another book with the same protagonist (Robert Langdon) that Brown wrote prior to this one called \\"Angels and Demons\\". It too is a great read - just as good as this one.
B00005JKHN|5.0|Keyed to the style of Disney artist Ervind Earle, SLEEPING BEAUTY has long been renowned as one of Walt Disney Studio's most artistically beautiful films--and now with this meticulous restoration Earle's vision comes to the home market in a DVD package that is sure to win praise from every fan of hand-drawn animation.<br /><br />The story, of course, is the time-honored fairy tale. Princess Aurora is cursed at birth by the evil Maleficent, who declares that on her sixteenth birthday the princess shall prick her finger on a spinning wheel's spindle and die--but fortunately the powers of good are able to mute the effect of the curse; the princess shall not die, but shall instead fall into a deep sleep from which she can be only awakened by love's first kiss.<br /><br />Earle's vision for the story is drawn from a host of sources, some of them more immediately apparent than others. The result is a curious mixture of flat illustration and meticulous detail that imparts both a modernist edge and the quality of an ancient illuminated manuscript--a truly remarkable concept that gives the film a visual style completely unlike any other among the Disney classics.  The DVD offers the option of viewing the film in either its original widescreen ratio or pan-and-scan format--but why any one would elect pan-and-scan is completely beyond me; if ever there was a film that made good and full use of the widescreen ratio, this is it, and you'll want to see every inch of Earle's remarkable work.<br /><br />Earle's style aside, SLEEPING BEAUTY has been influenced by a number of films that are worth noting.  In terms of plot detail, it has been very clearly influenced by Disney's earlier SNOW WHITE, and the designs for the evil Maleficent and her &#34;goons&#34; are very clearly influenced by FANTASIA's &#34;Night on Bald Mountain&#34; sequence--and to magnificent effect; Maleficent is easily among the darkest characters ever created for film.  Interestingly, many visual set-ups also seem to have been influenced by MGM's THE WIZARD OF OZ, most notably in the scenes in which the three good fairies rescue Prince Philip from Maleficent's nightmarish castle.<br /><br />Unlike some animated films, the voices are beautifully matched to the characters, with Mary Costa as Princess Aurora and Eleanor Audley (who also performed the Wicked Stepmother in Disney's CINDERELLA) as Maleficent standouts among the cast.  The score, which is based on the brilliant Tchaikovsky ballet score, is also extremely well handled and includes the memorable &#34;Once Upon a Dream.&#34;<br /><br />All of this has been lovingly, shining restored, and quite frankly even if you saw the film in its first release the result here will no doubt surpass it.  There is not a blip, a glitch, or a sound-surge to be found.  And as is usual with Disney &#34;limited release&#34; DVD editions, the package includes a host of extras, some designed to appeal to the younger set (there are two simple games, neither of which require a CD-ROM) for children and a host of interviews and documentaries.  Fortunately, many of the people involved in SLEEPING BEAUTY are still with us--including Ervind Earle and Mary Costa--and their various contributions make the bonus package truly superior.<br /><br />All of this said, it should be noted that like FANTASIA, SLEEPING BEAUTY is more likely to appeal to adults who can fully appreciate the visual charms of the film than to children, who may find the film's tendency to linger over visuals a bit too much for a limited attention span.  But this is indeed a Disney masterpiece, and it belongs in your collection.<br /><br />--GFT (Amazon.com Reviewer)--MGM's THE WIZARD OF OZ, most notably in the scenes in which the three good fairies rescue Prince Philip from Maleficent's nightmarish castle.

B000059ZLH|5.0|If you have not gotten this dvd yet and like Dream Theater, why havent you gotten it yet?  This is a must for all Dream Theater fans, I mainly got into Dream Theater March 2002, I got this dvd in July 2002.  Despite liking Dream Theater in between and buying most of their albums during that time, I never quite understood why they were praised so much, until I actually watched them in the dvd.  Anyone can easily see how they deserve the praise, Petrucci, Myung, and Ruddess move their fingers insanely fast, and Portnoy is just totally great and entertaining on drums.  This is the next best thing to going to their concerts, which i did finally go to summer 2003.
B0000029GA|5.0|This album is brilliant. It changed Hip Hop,and revolutionized thug poetry. You can thank Nas for all the MC's out there today, name one MC that Nas hasnt influenced...This is classic material, and those that disagree are either stupid little suburban kids that think that Eminem and 50 Cent is the ish, or just dont understand what REAL Hip Hop is all about<br />I-L representing..08 holla at your boi<br />~1~
B00004W50T|4.0|This is a good album.  Their second album is great.  But this one is really good as well, with songs like Tears of Rage and The Weight, it earns a spot on the BEST OF ALL TIME list.  But I will always be in love with their second, self-titled release.
B000088DSQ|5.0|I often like to hear what pianists who specialize in contemporary music have to say about pieces from the established repertoire; they tend to re-think even the old works. This, plus a recommendation from a friend, led me to buy this set featuring Pierre-Laurent Aimard. I had heard him play part of Messaien's 'Vingt Regards' this past season and was knocked out. Then I got his recording of the Ligeti &Eacute;tudes and was convinced by them that he is one of the most talented pianists today, at least in modern repertoire. I had heard rumors that Nikolaus Harnoncourt, having recorded a very successful Beethoven symphony set with the Chamber Orchestra of Europe, was planning to record the Beethoven Piano Concerti with them as well and I'd heard it was going to be with Martha Argerich. I later read, though, that she refused to participate at least partly because she didn't know all five of the concerti and didn't want to learn the ones she didn't already know. When I heard that the project was going ahead, but with Aimard, I was puzzled but very interested. In the set's booklet, Aimard indicates that although he had never performed with Harnoncourt, the conductor had heard him play a Beethoven sonata in recital and judged that he might make a wonderful collaborator. Aimard was, understandably, a bit surprised at being chosen, but quickly agreed to the project. These recordings, then, were taken, except for the recording of the Second Concerto, from live performances in Harnoncourt's hometown, Graz, Austria; the Second was recorded live in the Vienna Philharmonic's home hall, the Musikverein. The 3-CD set presents the concerti in the order in which they were written: 2, 1, 3, 4, 5.<br />There are a number of general comments to make about this collaboration. First, it is clear that both Harnoncourt and Aimard have re-thought the pieces from start to finish. There are not simply gazing admiringly at well-known monuments. They are getting up-close-and-personal and making observations, individually and together, that are fresh and new. Further, their cooperation is stunning; Harnoncourt, whose long-standing relationship with the COE is such that he can get anything he wants from them with a flick of the wrist, conducts the pieces as if the music were occurring to him in the now. This means that there are many tempo alterations, pauses, accents, mouldings of phrases that sound spontaneous. And Aimard matches him gesture for gesture. Occasionally  this is irritating, but usually it is simply surprising and enlightening. One thing is for sure: you never know what is just around the next corner. And this, of course, makes the music fresh and exciting. Following along with score I noted no flagrant disregard of Beethoven's notated indications, and indeed I saw that Aimard followed quite closely such things as Beethoven's sometimes quirky but always effective pedal markings and accents.<br />The COE, as a result of Harnoncourt's background in early music, uses minimal vibrato, the winds and brass sound like original instruments (although I don't know whether they actually are), the timpani are crisp (from leather-headed sticks?) as they were in the Harnoncourt/COE symphony set. The sound picture is exceptionally clear and the dynamic range exceptionally wide. The sound of the piano is not nearly as highlighted as it is in most concerto recordings; rather it sounds like it does in a concert hall. This seems particularly so in the latter two concerti. This strikes me as apt, since the Fourth is a rather like a symphonic fantasia with piano obbligato and the Fifth--in distinction to its usual presentation as a grand Romantic concerto with heroic piano solo--is a symphony with piano. For this reason, the Fourth and Fifth are particularly successful.<br />The slow movements are generally slower than usually heard, and they all feature heavenly string playing from the COE. The muted strings in the slow movement of the Fifth are matched by Aimard's slightly covered sound and the effect is heavenly. One doesn't want it to end, but when the final chord in B major resolves downward to the B flat opening of the final movement it is like waking from a dream to find oneself in a fresh and wonderful new world--one of Beethoven's master-strokes served up perfectly by Harnoncourt and his musicians. The colloquy--one might say 'debate'--between the piano and the orchestra in the middle movement of the Fourth is more genial than in some performances, but this is in the interest of a rather gentler overall approach in that concerto, one that I find attractive.<br />The Second concerto, usually played as a Haydnesque late-Classic concerto, is more full-blooded than one generally hears; this may be partly due to the rich, warm ambience of the recording venue, the Vienna Musikverein. Whatever the reason, I like this approach; I've often thought other performances have drained this concerto of its fire, focusing rather on its music-box features.<br />The First concerto in C major is, for whatever reason, my least favorite of the five, but it is given a loving, nuanced, sparkling performance here. The outer movements of the Third, in C minor, are the weakest of the set--although the performances are not at all bad; the sound is a little muddy as well. Its middle movement, though, one of Beethoven's loveliest movements, is perfect. Its stillness foreshadows the slow movements of Beethoven's late sonatas and quartets. Harnoncourt and Aimard are in complete accord on its extremely slow tempo and time seems to stand still.<br />In summary, then, this is one of the most successful Beethoven Concerto sets I've ever encountered. I would not want to be without Arrau/C. Davis (my favorite over the years), or various recordings by Gilels, Richter, Brendel, Ashkenazy, Kovacevich, Schnabel (that glorious Fifth with the Chicago Symphony!) and others. For new insights, though, and a slightly out-of-the-mainstream approach, as well as a deep satisfaction, I'll reach for this set often, I suspect.<br />Heartily recommended.<br />CD1=70;24 (2nd=31:10, 1st=39:14)<br />CD2=37:50 (3rd)<br />CD3=75:09 (4th=35:27, 5th=39:42)<br />TT=183:19<br />Scott Morrisons slightly covered sound and the effect is heavenly.

B000003TAW|5.0|If you're looking for an album with intelligent, however slightly weird, lyrics, amazing melodies and music, energy, and emotion, look no further. Weezer's blue album starts with a punch, and punk-like energy on &quot;My Name is Jonas,&quot; with &quot;Buddy Holly,&quot; &quot;Surf Wax America,&quot; and &quot;Holiday&quot; following its upbeat energy. &quot;In the Garage&quot; wavers between happiness and sentimentality, an ode to teenage geekiness. And then there's the mellower songs: &quot;Say It Ain't So&quot; is almost sad and almost angry, but completely powerful with its guitar. The album culminates with &quot;Only in Dreams&quot; one of the most truly beautiful songs I've ever heard. Rivers Cuomo's talent really shines here, in the melancholy lyrics and the lush instrumental part.<BR>In short, the blue album is amazing, BUY IT!
B000067J1H|5.0|I am Jack's story:<BR>    Fight Club is about total chaos and anarchy set in the modern-day world. You know the place. There is a gun pointed straight into our mouths and for a second, we see nothing but...wait, let me start eairlier...This is the story of a no-name individual (let's call him Jack) who feels, well, stuck. He lives in a very respectable apartment with some very respectable clothes and furniture with a very &quot;respectable&quot; job. Jack has spent the last six months of his life with insomnia. He can't sleep, nor can he keep a clear idea of what's going on around him. As he says, &quot;everything is a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy...&quot; I am Jack's life, and I'm ending one minute at a time.<br />I am Jack's solution:<BR>    Along come the support groups...Cancer, tumors, trauma, Jack has none of these things, but for some reason, feeling the pain of others who do helps him sleep. Jack starts attending as many of these sessions as possible in an attempt to feel the world around him. He lets go, and cries with the victims of these groups. And, as he so eloquently puts it, &quot;Babies don't sleep this well...&quot; It seems that Jack is cured until Marla Singer comes along. Marla is a tourist to these groups just like Jack, and she reflects his lie. &quot;I couldn't cry...so once again, I couldn't sleep.&quot;<br />I am Jack's call for help:<BR>    We wake up on an airplane on the way home from a business trip. We stare at our single-serving peanuts and our single serving cup of coffee. Next to us, a man spouts his incredibly cynical, yet subtly brilliant views on the world. Meet Tyler Durdin...I am Jack's need for friendship...Tyler and Jack have an interesting conversation for the rest of the flight, and Jack leaves and arrives home to find his apartment in flames...I am Jack's complete and utter numbness...Jack decides to call up Tyler for a place to stay for reasons that are unclear to both us and Jack.<br />I am Jack's new life:<BR>    We meet up with Tyler in Lou's Tavern discussing the next step for Jack. What happens now?...I am Jack's inflamed sense of confusion...Outside the bar, Tyler discusses things that Jack can do to help himself, including offering Jack shelter at his home. Jack accepts and off we go...&quot;I want you to hit me as hard as you can.&quot;<br />I am Jack's thoughts:<BR>    Fight Club is one of those rare films that was recommended to me by some friends of mine, who told me how cool and mind-blowing it was. The thing that makes it different from all of those other movies is that I actually ended up loving this film for everything it is and everything it tries to be (most of my friends' tastes compared to mine are drastically different). This film is sheer brilliance, and it sends a very strong and clear message to everybody: One needs to accept their life as it is and do what they can to make it better for themselves and others around them.<br />I am Jack's DVD, and I am worth every penny.
B00005QJDG|5.0|For being a live album, this is totally worth it.  The songs have the same sound, almost studio quality, but with a certain energy youll find with a live album.  The song selection on this is pretty good, featuring all of Scenes from a Memory, with a lot of other songs, including A Change of Seasons.  There are also two live video clips, one of Another Day and the other of a solo by Jordan Ruddess.  This album is definitely worth buying, either as a lover of Dream Theater, or even to get into them, though its best to have the studio albums first.
B00005JKOI|5.0|Ok, we already know that this movie is an all time classic and everyone between the ages 12-???? should have seen this or should see this movie. If your looking to buy this movie just buy it and save yourself the time and grief. So those who are familiar with the film and all the characters, what's up with James Spader a.k.a. &quot;Steff&quot; always wandering the halls when everyone else is in class? It begs to question, does this guy even go to the school or does he just walk around in his terry cloth blazer without socks all day long? But hey these are the reasons why we see this film and what make it a classical movie of its genre. As you might already figured this isnt really a crtiique on the film but more of a rebuttal on the film and some of its plot lines. Anyway, this psuedo review is more in the lines of good jest......so with that all said buy the film now and be happy......

I am fasanated with John Mayer's lyrical style, andi look forward to seeing much more from him in the future. If you arent sure what songs to listen to first, try 3x5, St. Patrick's Day, Great Indoors and Not Myself. The album itself is pure acoustic beauty
B00005JM02|5.0|Who cares about An Officer And A Gentleman?  I truly believe that Finding Nemo deserves all five stars- And then some!!!  Plus an Extra One!!!  Finding Nemo has changed my life.  It's one of those movies that even though they make you cry, you want to watch over and over.  Dori is the greatest character (besides Nemo) to ever hit the big screen!!!  Every person should have seen this movie.  To end the war between America and Iraq, we should have George Bush and Sadaam Hussain share popcorn and watch Finding Nemo!!!  So go out and buy this movie before I hunt you down and make you watch it!!!
B00005JKN9|1.0|I have always felt that Martin Scorsese was a very overated director, but this film was so bad it was hilarious. The acting was amateurish and the storyline so ridiculous and unbelievable that I felt I was watching a spoof.  It played like an old fashioned melodrama. No wonder Harvey Weinstien flipped when he saw this thing. You have to give it to Miramax and their marketing acumen; that they managed to get six academy award nominations for this junk is impressive.
B00003CWLF|5.0|Writing coach Jerry Cleaver writes that a good story is one that gets to you, one where you identify with the main character, feel what they feel. Well, this story sure got to me. Anna's character was written so that while I couldn't identify with her at the beginning, I certainly could at the end. Unfortunately, I understand the frustrations of a forbidden love only too well.<br />In spite of the unbearable tension, I personally am glad they never kissed. But even after replaying it several times, it's hard to figure out, though, when the turning point was in their relationship. The King indirectly referred to Anna as \\"friend\\" during the banquet, so I knew Anna had his respect by then, but when did it become more? Hm.<br />This is a movie with incredible sets and an incredible setting, with wonderful costuming, and the CGI work is jawdropping! In the director's commentary, Andy Tennant describes a scene with Chow Yun Fat (\\"Fattie\\") and Jodie Foster, noting they weren't even in the same room together because each cutaway shot was done on different days! What a shock, too, to learn that the rocket scene was totally computerized! I love learning about the filmmaking process!<br />Former child actor Jodie Foster has earned my respect. Tenant said they wanted Kate Winslet to play Anna at first, but there's obviously nothing a voice coach and professionalism can't accomplish with a lot of hard work. That goes for all the actors, none of whom spoke their native languages.<br />Chow Yun-Fat, being Chinese, spoke neither Thai nor much English, but had to learn both for this movie. To my mind, that's genius. I understand this was his first and thusfar only dramatic role (he's known in his country for comedies and martial arts films). If more non-comedic and non-martial arts roles for Asians ever become available, this should open big doors for him. He's a fantastic leading man -- I thought he was gorgeous, and I'll take him over ANY European-American actor any day.<br />Bai Ling, who plays the doomed concubine Tuptim, gives just a powerful, powerful performance, and has to perform throughout the movie without any hair.<br />I have to give director Andy Tennant his props, too. This beautiful film has me interested in his other films. I want to see if he does this kind of work on a regular basis or is this just a wonderful fluke.<br />The children were just adorable, especially the little one who was the King's favorite. Difficult to watch her die, but such was life back then. There are things even a king can't control.<br />I couldn't stand The King and I; I found it terribly racist, like a lot of what came out of Hollywood back then. I was hoping for a more intelligently done movie that more realistically depicted what Thailand was like back then, and I personally am grateful to see a king that doesn't look like Mr. Clean, and doesn't kill himself just because he lost a white woman.<br />I highly recommend watching the outtakes and watching the movie with the director's commentary. It really makes the story make sense after you know some background.<br />This is one I'd buy in a heartbeat. I understand this didn't do well at the box office, but I'd relish the chance to see it for the first time on the big screen.Ling, who plays the doomed concubine Tuptim, gives just a powerful, powerful performance, and has to perform throughout the movie without any hair.<br />I have to give director Andy Tennant his props, too.

B000002AVF|3.0|If you want to check out Mariah's best works in terms of creativity check out &quot;Butterfly&quot; and &quot;Glitter [Soundtrack]&quot;  The singles from &quot;Daydream&quot; (All number one hits) were great, and she's never sounded better... but the filler material here leaves more to be desired.  Highlighys include the Jermaine Dupri-produced #1 &quot;Always Be My Baby&quot; and the Puff Daddy produced hit &quot;Fantasy&quot;...a classic. The remix is just as good if not better then the original. The sampling on it works wonders and is superior to the original.  &quot;When I Saw You&quot; is lacking lyrically, and the later reworking of it 'Whenever You Call&quot; from &quot;Butterfly&quot; is much better.  &quot;Forever&quot; has a nice retro feel to it and is also a highlight.  &quot;I Am Free&quot; is also a great Gospel-like song but &quot;My Saving Grace&quot; from her latest offering &quot;Charmbracelet&quot; is similar and better. So overall if you want to get this Mariah album go ahead... but don't be expecting her bst material. Buy &quot;Butterfly&quot; and &quot;Glitter&quot; for that.

The type is in red and green, green for Fantasia and red for the \\"real world.\\" The colorful type is the *only* reason I originally picked this book from my mother's collection when I was in fifth grade. I'm now a freshman in college and to this day it is still one of my favorite stories. I enjoyed the first motion picture, but it paled in comparison to what the book can provoke in the imagination of the reader. I read a review a minute ago that states this book is a good bedtime story. I concur, with one admonition: Four-year-olds don't like it! (I tried reading it to my sister) Maybe for an older child. :-)

B000002KKC|4.0|What in the world does a band do, having released the most successful (at the time) album of all time, in Rumours? Surely not release a double album that alienates  the tens of millions of fans who bought your last 2 albums? Welcome to the crazy world of Fleetwood Mac and Tusk!!<br />It is now close to 25 years since the release of Tusk and in the wake of their most recent album, Say You Will, reviewers have been comparing these two tomes, with Tusk coming in for favourable reappraisal. Tusk is certainly the Mac's most experimental work, mainly due to the input of Lindsey Buckingham, who appears to have gone a little bonkers on some of his 9 contributions to the album - The Ledge (a sonic precursor to SYW's Red Rover), Not That Funny and That's Enough For Me appear to be a reflection of Buckingham's state of mind and while these songs are unique, they can grate a little. However in the title track, he has created a brilliant fusion of African drum rhythms and primal scream therapy - and it's still a firm fan favourite. Finally Walk A Thin Line is possibly his strongest contribution to this album and again a reference to his mindset (indeed he would go on to make a solo album called Go Insane).<br />However the contributions from the two female Macs, Christine McVie and Stevie Nicks make this an essential album to own. McVie appears to be in a sombre mood and with Brown Eyes and Over and Over, she takes up where she left off with Songbird in producing sad songs with beautiful melodies, all sung with cool polish. But it is Nicks who produces the strongest suite of songs, not one of them a dud. It was no coincidence that she would follow this up with her strongest solo album - she must have been fair bursting with great songs. Sara is still a great song today while Sisters of the Moon provides her with the opportunity to go full tilt into her witchy persona. Angel contains gorgeous three-part harmonies from the girls and Buckingham while Storms takes the McVie route of understated balladry. The undoubted highlight is Beautiful Child  - again a spare song but with Nicks' voice at its most touching, singing about an innocence that had long since past her by.<br />As always, Mick Fleetwood and John McVie provide excellent support on 'drum n' bass', particularly on the Buckingham tracks. Still, there is one moment during Beautiful Child (\\"Your hands, held mine so few hours\\") when Nicks and Buckingham's voices unite followed by the whirl of Christine McVie vocal in the background. Like a divine revelation, this moment shows the genius of this unlikely Anglo-American musical marriage and why this album stands as a powerful testament to their musical abilityunderstated balladry.

B00004UEDQ|5.0|We love Sandra Bullock movies in this house.  This one is no exception.  Sure there are a couple of cheesy moments, but for the most part, this one is probably her best, performance wise.  It's not easy to play a believable addict without resorting to over-used Hollywood cliches, and she plays it well without overdoing it.  A few nice examples are the sugar-addiction that most addicts experience when giving up the drug of choice.  The gum-wrapper chain was also very close to the truth.  That nervous \\"sober\\" energy needs to be used up somehow!  I was married to an alcoholic and everything she went through looked very familiar to what my ex-husband experienced.  Anyways, even if you are not familiar with addiction, this is still a very entertaining movie, as are all her other movies.  I would recommend this movie, ...

B00004W52U|2.0|I got this CD about a year ago.  i heard good things about it here and there.  I would here about them when reading about other bands i liked.  And as you can see from all the other reviews here, i heard nothing but good things about this group.  <BR>So i went to the store and was surprised at the availabilty of a cd from a late 80's lo fi punk band.<br />So then i listened to the cd.  In short the best way i can sum it up is to say, it is just like listening to music from any punk band that you would see in some persons basement.  Mr. Michaels voice is annoying, it is a relief anytime someone else, i imagine probably Tim Armstrong, lends a helping hand on the singing.  This brings me to the lyrics.  from the sound of it, they took one idea, made it the title of the song, and pretty much repeat that title over and over until the song is done.  and follow that formula for most songs.<BR>this starts to wear thin after you have gone through 8 or 9 tracks of basically the same thing and realize there are a whole lot more songs to go.<br />One thing i did find facinating was the ability to see the evolution of the band.  I admit that in the later years they were becoming more interesting adding elements of ska and other interesting things to the music.  <BR>I know that these fellows were very influention and revolutional.  but omiting this and just listening to the music, it is still just mediocre punk rock.
B000002TYK|5.0|Most seem to view this album lightly, as if it were just a fluffy attempt at pop music after the ever-so-significant Nirvana, yet I believe few realize the moment that Dave Grohl captured in this stupendous recording.  It's equal parts melody, distortion, crash, and confusion, delivered at a rapid-fire pace.  Even the ballads (&quot;Big Me&quot; &quot;Floaty&quot;) are either so white-hot intense or whip by you so fast that you can't help but be left reeling.  This can't be said for the later, more piecemeal Foo Fighters records made with full band support.  This is intensity distilled to its purest.<br />If you need further proof, check out the singles &quot;This is a Call&quot; or &quot;I'll Stick Around,&quot; two of the most perfectly realized pop-alternative songs ever to be written.  They are perfect dichotomies of lush melody and hard-edged rock.  &quot;Weenie Beanie&quot; and &quot;Wattershed&quot; are brilliant nuggets of hard distortion, and it doesn't even matter that the lyrics are barely discernable.  Then there's the masterpiece of a closer &quot;Exhausted,&quot; which is at least sonically one of the greatest songs Grohl has written and stands on its own despite its umbilical ties to Nirvana.  Sounding like the chaos that would surround a close death or tragedy, the guitars wail like a thunderstorm around Grohl's barely discernable, gentle vocals.  Towards the end drawn out feedback meets one last instrumental crescendo, which fades out slowly.  It's one of the most powerful musical moments ever to be committed to tape, a statement you'd be hard pressed to make about many musicians, especially someone who has to live up to something so great.  It's amazing that for the most part all this noise came from just one man.<br />Though my familiarity with other Foo Fighters records is limited, it's hard to think Grohl will ever be able to top himself again.  Over the course of the next few records he's drowned himself in his own over-sentimentality (see &quot;My Hero&quot; as an example- it's almost painful to listen to this too-obvious homage to Cobain).  It doesn't matter, though, as this record stands as a testament to the moment, a truly raw, engaging, and spirited record of a brilliant and essential period in music.  It's the sounding of a death knell as well as a sign to the future.

B000077VT7|1.0|Thank heaven I borrowed the latest version of The Bourne Identity from my public library and didn't shell out bucks to Blockbuster for this horrible remake of an earlier mediocre film of Robert Ludlum's novel. I'd hate to think of any of my pennies trickling down into Ludlum's estate.  Are his heirs that hard up they need payment for this kind of dreck? Since most of the one-star reviews have already covered the ground effectively, I'll just say that Matt Damon and his forgetable female co-star were not served well by the cinemaphographer.  If their faces had &quot;best sides&quot; we did not see them. Both actors appeared singularly unattractive throughout.   Damon's nose is not his best feature, especially in profile, yet we were forced to gaze upon it far too often.   Cliches abound of course, including the old chestnut of the hero chopping off his girl friend's hair in huge clumps, while in the next shot she looks as if she's just visited the best hair dresser in Paris.  And why did her hair look the same color after the dye job? If disguise was their objective, it failed.  <BR>     The film, no longer a Ludlum thriller, is now an &quot;action pic,&quot; with the required car chase.  This chase was so boring and predictable, I turned the sound down so the squealing tires did not annoy my three cats. <BR>     Damon does shine in a certain type of movie--in Grisham's The Rainmaker he was effective as a neophyte lawyer up against big insurance corporation sharks.  In that film, there was real chemistry generated between him and his 80-year-old landlady, Theresa Wright. The same can't be said of his pairing with his forgetable partner in The Bourne Identity.
B00005JKZV|5.0|One of the greatest movies of all time. If you haven't seen this movie, you must see it.<br />The plot is wonderful. Not to complex, but just enough to get you caught up and blown away by it. The special effects are wonderful, the cinematography is fantastic, and the acting is great too. Ian McKellen, Miranda Otto, and Viggo Mortensen all shine, with the last two being newer actors, they both gave wonderful performances.
B00006CXXU|4.0|I was shocked at how good, how real and how deep is album is. I could honestly careless about her way of dressing (which, all the time isn't whorish), what's inside is what counts. This album is so good...I know all my friends abhor Christina and what she stands for, but I really love this album. Finally a pop act that has depth. I cry and smile when I hear Beautiful. I feel good and empowered when I hear Fighter. Um. Dirrty I can leave on the shelf. LOL. This Album isn't all about sex, it's got such soul. I have major respect and kudos for Christina. I love her voice and this album.<br />Screw what everyone says about her style, I don't like it, but that's her thing. She used to be cute, but you know? She was tool. For the first time she's singing her own songs, and I think an image change was good for her. I don't think little girls should be dressing like that, then again, where are the parents? Anyway, this album rocks, and I normally HATE pop with a passion. So..yeah, try it, you might like it.

B00005JM02|5.0|I'm usually not a big fan of any cartoon movies that comes out in the theater but let me tell you this: FINDING NEMO IS THE BEST MOVIE I'VE SEEN SO FAR!!! And it is not a kid movie! My best friend who is 20 and I am turning 19, we went to see this movie because we couldn't decide on what to watch and it was the best decision we've ever made. <BR>I've seen this movie twice and if I had money to spend I would have gone to see it again and again because no matter what I might be feeling, FINDING NEMO always cheers me up...especially Dory...I LOVE DORY!!!<BR>I cannot wait for the DVD to come out because I am definitely going to buy it for my small but very own collection. And if you haven't seen the movie, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? GO SEE IT!!!
B00008DDXC|1.0|First off, the storyline for these movies are horrible, and the books aren't exactly much better.<br />The acting is horrid, I don't know why they even wanted to use some of the lead actors in this movie, they were 100% horrible<br />Please, pass on this movie. You can use your time with something more worth it.
B000021YQV|4.0|I'll admit it, the first time I listened to this CD, I hated it. Absolutely loathed it. The only songs I liked on it at that time where &quot;Chop Suey!&quot; and &quot;Toxicity.&quot; I tried to listen to it again a few months later, and couldn't even get past the first song. But last night I popped it in yet again, giving it basically its last chance.<br />Third time's a charm, eh?<br />Now I really, really like this CD. There isn't a single song I don't like (although &quot;Aerials&quot; is probably my least favorite; I didn't like it as a single). I can't even pick the standouts--every song is great. &quot;Toxicity&quot; still remains my favorite song on the album, however--amazing all around.<br />However, I know System of a Down is not for everybody. My brother, for example, hates them, and apparently so do other reviewers on this site. But there are also quite a few reviews in Toxicity's favor. Basically, you have to pick it up and decide for yourself. But in my opinion, a great album.
B0000A1RJI|4.0|Great Music but... something went wrong somewhere. This is very enjoyable music, but the amount of distortion present in the high level passages makes it hard to listen to on any kind of decent stereo. It appears the producers never listened to the final product, or something went wrong with the burning process, and no one listened to this before it shipped! There is really no excuse for this in the 21st century!<br />I hope sometime they get a real orchestra, with real musicians, playing in a real hall, to record this. Just too much electronic processing (compression?) going on. I wonder if there were any real instruments used at all?  Strings just don't sound like that.<br />Despite these flaws, I listen to this a lot. There is a tremendous amount of different rythms and variations on the themes that it's mind-boggling, and it does remind me of the movie, which I loved! I like sondtracks that can stand on their own, and this one can. My rating: Music-5 stars, sound-2 stars.
B00009L1TA|5.0|Basic is an excellent military thriller that will keep you guessing from beginning to end.  After a Rangers training mission goes horribly wrong, an interrogator is brought in to try and find out why only two of seven soldiers came back from the mission.  Joined by the Provost Marshal of the base, the interrogator, Tom Hardy, goes back and forth between the two survivors who both have their own stories of what happened in the Panama jungle.  Much of the story is in flashback as we see what possibly happened during the failed mission.  This story has so many twists and turns that you really need to watch this movie twice to fully appreciate it.  Basic will have you asking yourself questions about why this happened or was that possible for days after watching the movie.  The ending is perfect for the movie.  I can almost guarantee that you will not see it coming.<br />  John Travolta gives an excellent performance as Tom Hardy, DEA agent and ex-Army interrogator brought in to find out what happened during the mission.  You can tell just by looking that he enjoyed making this movie.  Connie Nielsen plays Julie Osborne, Hardy's parnter during the investigation.  She is very good as the story unfolds before us.  Samuel L. Jackson is also good as Sergeant Nathan West, the sadistic leader of the Rangers on the mission.  The movie also stars Tim Daly, Taye Diggs, Brian Van Holt, and Harry Connick JR all who give very good performances.  The DVD offers widescreen presentation, trailers from several movies including Basic, and two featurettes that shine some light on the twists and turns of the plot.  This is a great military thriller that will keep you riveted throughout the movie.  The ending has to be seen, so I will not tell anything about it.  Check out Basic for a great ride of a movie!
1878424114|5.0|This factual book quickly cuts to the core of the topic of spirituality. The spiritual laws are appropriate for an age where individuals struggle to search for deeper meaning while being confronted by scarcity of time. As an introductory course, the author packaged the basic principles of spirituality in a short set of essays.  Each principle is clearly described in terms of how it operates and its significance to living successfully.  The teaching is void of spiritual and philosophical dogma and more centred on practical spirituality. Each chapter ends with advice on how to integrate the spiritual laws into our daily lives. Although it is quick to read the book, the book demands from the reader to be read more than once. Each essay needs to be pondered and practised to get real value from the book. For the curious, the book has enough to trigger some new spiritual insights. The serious spiritual seeker will find the spiritual laws as a life style and the book a life companion.
B000056H24|5.0|The Greatest Story Ever Told is a huge epic movie that boasts an impressive cast full of Hollywood notables.  The movie follows the life of Jesus from his birth in a stable in Bethlehem to his teachings with his disciples all the way to his crucifixion and Resurrection.  Because the film is so huge, many parts of the life of Jesus are just skipped over and talked about later by characters who saw it happen or heard about it.  This is surprisingly effective to show how quickly Jesus' notoriety spread throughout the area.  There are several very good scenes done with no sound except for Alfred Newman's fantastic score even though we know people in the background are screaming at Jesus as he walks by carrying the cross.  One particularly effective scene involves Simon of Cyrene, played by Simon Poitier, helping Jesus carry the cross after he has fallen.  As Jesus gets up, he grabs onto Simon's arm who helps him go on.  It is a very short scene, but nonetheless very moving.<br />  The cast for this movie could go on for pages.  Max von Sydow gives an excellent performance as Jesus Christ, although he might not look like the usually accepted idea of Jesus.  Charlton Heston and Telly Savalas also give very good performances as John the Baptist and Pontius Pilate.  The film also stars David McCallum as Judas, Jose Ferrer as Herod Antipas, Dorothy McGuire as Mary, Martin Landau as Ciaphias, Donald Pleasence as Satan(although he is credited as the Dark Hermit), and many others.  The film also stars Michael Anderson JR, Roddy McDowall, Victor Buono, Ed Wynn, Sal Mineo, Ina Balin, Carroll Baker, Van Heflin, Jamie Farr, and so many more.  There are several very small cameos most notably John Wayne, Shelley Winters, Sidney Poitier, and Claude Rains all of which are pretty good for how small they are.  The Special Edition DVD offers the widescreen presentation, theatrical trailer, making of documentary, an altered scene during the crucifixion scene, still gallery, and a filmmaker's documentary.  For an excellent look at the life of Jesus, if somewhat sanitized, check out The Greatest Story Ever Told!
B00003CWL6|5.0|I've just seen this remarkable film for the first time last night and I have not been able to breathe reaguarly sense. This is that rare movie that slips threw the cracks of all the buddy comedies and inspirational sports dramas to deliver something so original and new, and at the same time as familar as the ground we walk on. <br />This movie has no flaws. And I can assure you that is a fact, not niavety. I've never seen a film this honest and brutal and touching. I don't believe I have ever cried so hard at the end of a movie, not because a character had died, but because the last year of his stupid life was the most wonderful thing I had ever witnessed.<br />This is a movie that will change you. This may sound overly dramatized, but I am a different person for having seen this.<br />I miss the people in this picture.  I truely miss them. Not in a clainering-for-a-sequel kind of way, but god-what-will-there-lives-be-like/how-will-I-live-without-them kind of way.<br />Ok, enough vauge admeration, on to the actual review.<br />This is one of those movies that is hard as all hell to pen down.<BR>I suppose you could say it's about a middle-aged man who despertley wants to sleep with a teenage girl, a working mom sick of herself but rufuses to believe its anyone's fault but every one else,the aforementioned people's daughter who believes she is ugly and worthless until she meets and falls for her voyuristic-drug dealing neighbor and makes her realize how beautiful she truely is. <br />But really, it is so much simpler than that.<br />This film is about the beauty that is found in everything: a plastic bag caught in the wind, a dead bird, the face of the girl you love and even a gaping head wound.<br />Again,I was not being over zealeus when I said this film WILL change you. So long as you can look closer and see the beauty of it, you wll with out a doubt be a different person when the credits roll.<br />Thank you Sam Mendes. Thank you Alan Ball. Thank you Kevin Spacey,Annette Benning,Thora Birch, Mena Suvari,Chris Cooper, Wes Bentley and Thomas Newman.<br />Thanks so vary much.
B000002L3P|4.0|Ledbetter Heights is a very strong debut album from Kenny Wayne Shepherd. Shepherd's guitar style is very reminiscent of the late, great Stevie Ray Vaughan. Most of the material here is very strong. The opening tracks \\"Born With A Broken Heart\\" and \\"Deja Voodoo\\" received extensive airplay on AOR radio and are both excellent tracks featuring Shepherd's outstanding playing. Other strong tracks include the slow blues of \\"Shame, Shame, Shame\\", the soulful \\"Riverside\\", and the driving \\"Aberdeen.\\" His version of Howlin' Wolf's \\"I'm Leaving You (Commit A Crime)\\" is also an excellent track. However, the best example of Shepherd's playing may be on the slow live track \\"While We Cry\\" and the killer ending title track which sounds like it would fit in nicely on Vaughan's Texas Flood album. Other tracks such as \\"Everybody Gets The Blues\\" and \\"What's Goin' Down\\" are decent, but not as strong as the rest of the album. A great debut, highly recommended to fans of blues guitarists such as SRV as well as the new breed of blues players like Jonny Lang.
B00004TRD8|5.0|*This review is about the ultimate edition of this film, not the &quot;Extreme Edition&quot;.*<br />The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is sent back in time to protect young John Connor (Edward Furlong) from the evil T-1000 (Robert Patrick). Along the way they get John's mom Sarah (Linda Hamilton) out of a mental institute. She is there because nobody believes her story about the approaching &quot;Judgment Day&quot;. So Sarah plans to prevent Judgment Day from happening, all while the T-1000 is hunting down the three of them.<br />I own the Ultimate Edition, which I managed to buy last year, and is definitley the best DVD ever. It has 2 versions of the movie (the theatrical version and the Special Edition which has 15 extra minutes of footage) plus an extended Special Edition with 5 more minutes than the Special edition but you need to type in 82997 and enter between numbers to access this. It also has three documantaries, storyboards, commentary, and a whole lot more. Good luck trying to find this. If you do manage to find this then buy this. Otherwise, you'll just have to stick with the recently released extreme edition.
B00000AF95|4.0|Animalize was the last of the trio of great heavy metal albums that Kiss produced in the '80s following Creatures Of The Night and Lick It Up. While the album is strong and certainly one of their heaviest, their songwriting slipped a little bit with the departure of guitarist Vinnie Vincent.<br /><br />This is the first album when Kiss became more Paul Stanley's band mainly because Gene Simmons was concentrating on outside products like acting and producing other bands like Keel and Black N' Blue. Paul's songs are clearly the stronger tracks here, whether it's heavier tracks like \\"Under The Gun\\" and \\"I've Had Enough (Into The Fire)\\" or more radio-friendly tunes like \\"Thrills In The Night\\" and the excellent hit single \\"Heaven's On Fire.\\" Gene Simmons does contribute a couple strong tunes with \\"Murder In High Heels\\" and \\"Lonely Is The Hunter.\\" Other tracks like \\"While The City Sleeps\\" are decent but owe more to the excellent guitar playing of Mark St. John than the songs themselves. St. John's guitar playing clearly resembles the '80s shredding guitar era. However, his playing complements the heavier songs very well. Eric Carr's drumming continues to impress, particularly on \\"Under The Gun\\" and \\"I've Had Enough (Into The Fire).\\" This would be their last strong album until 1992's Revenge which ironically contains a few songs co-written with Vinnie Vincent. Recommended to fans of Kiss' heavier work.
B00005OWEG|3.0|Can anyone really believe that Francis Ford Coppola wanted this film to be an unmercifully drole three stooges comedy?  <BR>Was it only the editor's work that formed a soul-numbing drama out of frivolous and meandering vignettes of military life in Viet Nam? <BR>This version cannot be supported by reasonable film-making concepts. It fails the test of a 'redux' work; if a new viewer has not seen the 'original', this film is a disappointment and engenders no lingering respect. <BR>My advice is to hold on to your VHS original version, even have it transferred to DVD if you can, because it is the version with the most cinematic power.  The only improvement 'Redux' can provide is in the soundtrack.
B000002UB3|5.0|As the final outing for the Beatles before their break-up, we are treated to this melodic, spellbinding, and in some cases haunting, delight. Each song holds its own in its very own way.<br />Come Together- one of the Beatles' most popular songs for obvious reasons. A bit overplayed in today's commercials, but still a classic.<BR>Something- another classic, with an unforgettable tune and gorgeous vocals.<BR>Maxwell's Silver Hammer- a delightfully fun and dark song, depicting a young man murdering two professors and a judge, to an upbeat tune.<BR>Oh! Darling- a Beatles' Elvis tribute. Just kidding, but this 50's themed song just does not get old.<BR>Octopus's Garden- the song that first brought me to the Beatles', when I was 7. Enjoyable for all ages, any day, any night.<BR>I Want You- who DOESN'T picture the boys dropping acid to this one. Awesome piece of work on an already awesome album.<BR>Here Comes the Sun- another beauty, with an upbeat, inspiring love tune to it.<BR>Because- my personal favorite on the album. While it is rather short, it is truly spellbinding.<BR>You Never Give Me Your Money- this song jumps all over the place as far as emotions go, and takes the listener along, much to our pleasure.<BR>Sun King, Mean Mr. Mustard, Polythene Pam, She Came in Through the Bathroom Window, Golden Slumbers, Carry That Weight, The End- the Abbey Road medley, as it's come to be known. A fun rhapsody that takes you all over the crazy world of these four.<BR>Her Majesty- I still can't contain my laughter at the thought of Paul courting the Queen. Nice closing.<br />If you don't already own this album, for the love of God, get it. You'll be a better person after hearing it.
B00005OM4N|5.0|I love this cd from start to finish.I cannot wait 4 the trend setters new cd in the fall
0739302043|3.0|It's easy to get lost in this story of religious artifacts and secret societies. The author stays away from romance, for the most part, which is a nice change. This is a classic thriller (minus the token romance) about a secret code related to Leonardo Da Vinci and a secret society that is hiding the Holy Grail, protecting it against the most conservative of Catholics. Ludicrous stuff, but entertaining.<br />The narrator does a fairly good job, but I have a few quibbles. First, the female voice he does is not convincing and may make you laugh out loud. His French accent is not bad, but it is cookie-cutter variety. His British accent needs some work, and his Scottish is, well, not Scottish. He paces the story well, however, and keeps us entertained.<br />In the abridging of the text, a few substantive errors have crept in. For one, the heroine lets slip to another character that her grandfather was involved in the secret society, but later on when she mentions it a second time to the same character he reacts with great surprise.<br />The Da Vinci Code would likely make for a better read than a listen, but it will help pass the hours on the interestate.
B00005N83M|5.0|This is a flawless sophmore effort.I wonder how could someone say that this cd is not good when it sold 4 mill.I love songs like walking on sunshine ,play ,come over, dance with me, I'm real and the remix of I'm real.She is real on this cd she really comes alive on the dance tracks.
B00009V7RF|5.0|I'm a new listener to BEP and this CD is one of the best I've listened to in a long time.  No, I didn't buy the CD for \\"Where is the Love\\", which is way too bubble gum pop-ish for me.  Other than that, the CD is very eclectic.  Every song sounds different and has its own beat.  The best songs on the track are Shutup and Sexy. BEP is keepin' it real. THE CD IS AWESOME.

0783229526|5.0|Now.. admittedly, this movie can get very tedious. I'm not particularly a Johnny Depp fan, but now and again, I see some works of his (Sleepy Hollow, What's Eating Gilbert Grape) that remind me of what a class actor he really is. Having spent a lot of time with Hunter S. Thompson obviously worked a charm with Depp, as his performance shines as drugged out journalist Raoul Duke. <BR>Duke has set off to Vegas with his attorney and a boot-full of the craziest drugs you could ever imagine in one setting. The entire course of the film is basically one enormous trip, and the part I particularly enjoyed about this film is that no matter how bent, there's always Duke talking you through the moment - expressing his terror and euphoria.<br />I heard something about a lot of parents lobbying against this film because of the high drug intake, but in my opinion, after seeing bats attack you, reptiles in the casino lounge, and your attorney grow breasts on the side of his body, I don't think I'd ever touch the stuff these guys take. Films like Requiem For A Dream, Trainspotting and Fear and Loathing just help emphasise the reality of drug taking, and show the lows as well as the highs. <BR>I commend the crew on this one.
B000001EYW|5.0|The boys were doing well in 1997. Hall of Fame Induction, the One Night Only wave.  Twenty years after disco a whole generation of new fans were hearing the Bee Gees for the first time.  I myself was one of these.  My father had to force me to watch One Night Only, but the song Alone was what peaked my interests.<br />Alone, the first song from Still Waters, was like nothing I had ever heard before, much less like any of the Bee Gees music I had heard.  The bagpipes and upbeat tempo should conflict with the saddening lyrics, but it all blends together perfectly with Barry's verses and Robin's chorus<br />I Surrender sounds slightly different. Barry's breathly lead is tops. The one complaint I've heard about this album is it is too much breathy Barry. You just have to be in the right mood, I guess.  The harmony of the boys is great on this album, and the lyrics, well, one should not read them with their parents around!<br />Brother Mo time! Closer Than Close is Maurice's contribution to the album, and really the only time you can honestly say you're hearing him.  The lyrics are very personal and Maurice's delivery is well, DAMN!  Again everytime you get a taste of Maurice you want to hear more!<br /> Next is I Will, my favorite song on the album.  It starts out sounding a little bit like that silly Titanic song, but Robin and Barry's story of a love triangle is very well arranged and written, musically and lyrically.<br /> Obsessions is a very intriguing listen.  The Brothers refer to this as a `stalker song'.  The extra effects in the song set it off, and some of my favorite perverse lines are in this one.  Depending on your mood, you can either get into the groove or sleep quite pleasanty after listening to Still Waters.  When I've got troubles I can listen to Still Waters, and well, it calms my turbulent waters still.<br />Naturally, there are two more b-sides that didn't make it onto the American release.  Love Never Dies and Rings Around the Moon were part of the  1994 Love Songs project that never materialized.  Love Never Dies is a powerful song from Robin and Maurice.  I haven't been able to find the lyrics for Rings Around the Moon, but what you hear in the song is very uplifting.  This song deserves to be in the tops lists of Bee Gees Ballads.  Still Waters seems to reflect the feelings of the brothers at the time.  At peace with themselves enough to express themselves whole heartily and thus inspire others.  So go listen and express yourself too!the  1994 Love Songs project that never materialized.  Love Never Dies is a powerful song from Robin and Maurice.

B00007BH5C|5.0|Howard Shore did an excellent job composing music for this masterpiece trilogy.The music seems to fit in perfectly with every single scene. While some of the music is soothing, the other pieces are wonderfuly loud and triumphant. I never get tired of listening to this CD.
B000006YYW|5.0|Imo it is the best of the Robin solo albums. Made in 1982, then released in 83, this was Robin's second solo effort. The first, Robin's Reign, came when the brothers split in 1969. In 82, Robin was in a new relationship, a new father, and he was making this album while on good terms with his brothers. All the songs on HOAY (I love sounding that out!) are composed by Robin and Maurice, and you can even hear Maurice backing on some of the songs.<br />Robin was clearly happy at this time, or at least happier than he was while making Robin's Reign. This jubilance is evident in the first song, Juliet. It is a very happy go lucky bubbly song one would never expect from Robin Gibb. He sounds different, and sings quite high through the song and album. Sometimes you can't understand what he's saying.  The album is very 80s sounding, but that doesn't make it less enjoyable today. In fact, Juliet will really get stuck in your head.<br /> Next is the title song How Old Are You. This is one of the ones it seems you can also hear Maurice. It continues the upbeat style of Juliet. Actually there is no slow song on the album, or any of Robin's 80s solo albums for that matter! The lyrics on the album are superb. Each song has a hook that will stuck in your head. The arrangements are also interesting. It is mosty just Robin in dubs and overdubs, with Maurice backing on some. However, Robin variates his voice within the songs and it sounds like three or four people at times. Very effective.<br />In and Out of Love is slower than the first two songs, but still very smooth. It has a bit more of an 80s sound to it, but I like the lyrics, and its one of the few where you can understand what Robin is saying. Even my mother likes this one. She kept asking me who it was, since she refused to believe it was Mr. Quiver Robin. Its interesting that before the 80s solo work, Robin always sang the really sad or sappy Bee Gees songs, but when the group comes together again for ESP, Robin is different. Stronger, more confident in himself and his voice.<br />Danger is somewhat unique sounding in comparision with the rest of the album. The music is different, and Robin sings in a different voice. It's a nice break from the higher singing. He Can't Love You continues the `hook will get stuck in your head' trend. This is the one song that perhaps sounds like the Robin people were expecting, probably because it is the one that sounds like a Bee Gees song. Great story song with a perfectly arranged chorus.rent.

What I thought was a mystery novel about a boy searching for the killer of a dog turns out to be a Jerry Springer episode.  A disfunctional family and a love triangle are revealed with the autistic boy finding himself in the middle of it all.  A dog does die and there is a search for a killer, but once the father tells all, chaos ensues!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Nevertheless, a very good book.
B00005JM1F|4.0|This is not high-brow humor, it is not about plays on words and intellectual laughs... it is about beer, sex, and all other things that fraternities are stereotypically known for.  The first time I saw the movie (in the theater) I thought it was funny, but did not find it too memorable.  Seeing it a second time (at my husband's coaxing) I found it much funnier.  We did purchase the unrated edition, but I don't think there was really too much material that was added...<br />I loved the cameos in the movie, from Snoop Dogg to Andy Dick... they really added to the overall humor.<br />The special deleted scenes on the DVD are also great--don't miss them!  Also, if you are a Will Ferrell (SNL) fan, check out the Inside the Actors Studio clip.  It runs a little long, but has some hilarious moments.
0449002128|2.0|Former Israeli spy Gabriel Allon has retired to become an art restorer.  Then, his old adversary, a terrorist known only as Tariq, begins knocking off high-ranking Israeli diplomats and the head of &quot;the Office,&quot; Ari Shamron (Ariel Sharon?) brings Gabriel back, who, in his turn, enlists the services of a ghost from his past and another Israeli spy, Jacqueline Delacroix, a Paris fashion model.  Allon is moody and darkly handsome and spends most of the novel listening to his wire taps and traveling back and forth from London to Paris to touch base with Shamron the Puppetmaster.  <br />By the end of the novel... Allon still hasn't done anything worthy of his supposedly widespread notoriety within the spy community.  He's quite passive.  Most of the leg work, pardon the pun, is performed by Delacroix who seduces a Palestinian devotee of Tariq named Yusef.<br />The nuggets dealing with the art are more interesting than the nominal intrigue, most of which is undercut by the scenes in which we find out Tariq is one step ahead of everybody (and always in such amazing disguises that not even his cronies recognize him).  This takes the wind out of the sails of a lot of the momentum because you already know most of the &quot;good guys&quot; are toiling for naught.<br />The final, fatal flaw comes near the end when Silva seems to throw all reason to the wind and has a character basically walk off the street into a Senator's home (and the Senator is hosting a well-known international figure) carrying a gun in his pocket.  True, this novel was written before 9/11 but even so, where are the metal detectors?  Where are all the Secret Service agents who are in great supply upstairs but seem to have nothing to do with the catering people going in and out of the building downstairs.  It's a mess.<br />This book came with a high recommendation but I have to say that I will not be reading any more Silva books after this.
B000089RVX|5.0|Let me preface my review by saying that for the past 4 weeks I haven't listened to anything else in my car's cd player.  I commute 2 hours a day to and from work, so I estimate I have listened exclusively to this cd about 40 times throughout the last month.<br />All I can say is... WOW.  This album is a perfect integration of music, lyrics, and absolutely SUPERB singing from Amy Lee.  Her voice alone sets this band apart from anything else on the market.  Having heard her, I think I finally understand the draw of the Sirens.<br />That having been said, I was enthralled at how many layers the album has.  Being a big R.E.M. fan, I always find myself striving to unravel the mystery of &quot;what is this song really about?&quot;  After ten listens or so I began to make sense of everything.  <br />Then I started to think about the album as a whole, and it dawned on me how easily each song can be woven into a larger tapestry.  I won't spoil your own take with mine, since the true reward of this album is in whatever personal meaning you may find in it, but I'll say that I find it interesting that the first 5 songs focus on forsaking death for life, the 6th song is about the balancing point between the two, and the remaining 5 focus on the living forsaking life for death.  Trust me when I say this album rewards thought and patient listening.<br />The lyrics are haunting, and I was ecstatic to read that the band writes the songs themselves.  Nothing is better than a singer who has true passion and conviction in what they're singing about.  <br />If you're looking for something thought-provoking, dark, surreal, and moody, you absolutely can't go wrong with this cd.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|I have read that six weeks before the movie went into the theaters, Jerry Bruckheimer ordered a new score be commissioned because the first score wasn't &quot;piratey&quot; enough!  I think considering the time limit of six weeks, this is an admirable work. The music enhanced my enjoyment of the movie which I consider to be the best of the summer movies of 2003.
B000001F3C|3.0|I recently listened to this cd, and i enjoyed it, but i wouldn't buy the cd given the chance. With only 10 songs on the album, too many of the songs came off week. The greatest songs on this album were probably, &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; and &quot;Like A Song&quot;. So i would recommend trying to listen to the cd before going and spending your money on it.
0393057658|3.0|Too much of a Liar's Poker view of the world.  Billy Beane is like the guy on Salomon's mortgage desk in the 80's who was brilliant because he realized the Ivy Leaguers must rule the world.  <br />The OBP deal is only valid because Tejada needs people on base so he can drive them in. But surprise  - \\"Miggy swings at everything\\" and rarely walks!  He's from the Dominican Republic and those guys swing baby because nobody walks off the island.<BR>Chavez is a slugger and not a walker as well.<br />You need guys with high OBP's so the high slugging percentage guys can drive them in.  <br />The real secret to the A's regular season success isn't Beane or any Ivy League number cruncher but the ZHM formula  - starting pitching Zito, Hudson and Mulder.  Their lack of success in the post season is due to a shaky bullpen and poor baserunning and an incredibly poor decision not to offer Jason Giambi the no-trade clause on the contract extension that met the rest of his demands. The A's blew the chance to lock Giambi at much lower price than the Yankees ultimately paid.  Hmmm - the best combination slugging + on base percentage player in the game at below market value - That's inconceivable but the A's let Giambi walk.<br />Anybody out there think the A's would have lost to the Twins if Giambi were wearin' the yellow, white & green in 1992.<br />The name of the game is to win.  The most wins for lowest payroll is still a loser's game.
B000066NW0|1.0|Don't be fooled by what she says about herself - that she is punk or rock or whatever. She pretends to be something more than Britney or Christina but she is in fact much worse than them. Her songs are dull and pure pop - sweet and pink like Britney's ones. If you want punk or rock music - there are plenty of real artists that can offer you real music. Forget about Avril! Don't waste your money on this album - it's just not worthy
B00005V3Z4|5.0|When I picked up Donnie Darko, I didn't know what to expect.  It had been recommended to me for fans of things like Dark City, and other sci-fi psychological thrillers, so there was a certain sense of awe and mystique that surrounded the film before I got it.<br />If when you finish the film and you don't have a deep sense of the possibilities in the universe, the calling of self-sacrifice, and the beauty of both time and the aspects that make us human, watch it again.<br />When you watch it, try to focus not on the surface teen issues, but instead focus on the meaning of the experience of the film.  Make a commitment to trying to understand Darko's complex character, and what he struggles with in life, and how he reconciles those troubles with the gifts that he has been given (and his gifts are extraordinary indeed).  Oh, and remember that if you're confused through most of the movie, that's good.  That means that by the end, you should have a clear idea of what's going on.  If at any point you think you know what's going on, rethink, and rethink, and rethink again.<br />This is science-fiction, remember.  Although it may claim other things, it is a story about a young boy who we understand at the beginning does not have it all together, and he is fated for things much greater than he knows.  The movie is a riddle, so I leave you to solve the answer.  Don't leave without it.<br />Heartily recommended.
B00005JK8K|2.0|I have been John Woo's avid fan for years.  I have been following his works since his directorial effort in HK namely, &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot; starring Chow Yuen Fatt.  John Woo is a very good story teller especially when it involves the unspoken honour of brotherhood, the final showdown between the good &amp; the bad (especially when one's wittiness is matched by the other's deviousness).  Compounded by his signature-style slow motion sequence, we have modern classic action movies in the making.  Among his works in Hollywood, he was at his best in MI2 starring Tom Cruise, Face Off starring Nicholas Cage &amp; John Trovolta, Broken Arrow starring John Trovolta &amp; Christian Slater.  Other works of his such as Hard Target starring Jean Claude Van Demme is rather pedestrian.  I'm sad to say that Windtalkers belongs to the latter category.  Mind you, this is John Woo's first exposure to combat movie.  When his work is to be compared with Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan or even HBO's special, Band of Brothers, Windtalkers doesn't fare so well.  John tries to squeeze as much action packed sequence into the movie &amp; not compromising upon the character building exercise.  All I can say is that there is too much battle repetition, &amp; all characters in the movie are two-dimensional.  In the end, when the main characters are slowly been killed off by those faceless Japanese soldiers, we don't feel for them.  I'm feeling sorry for Nicholas Cage &amp; Christian Slater as they are trying hard to save this movie from sinking further.  Nicholas has got a demented face the whole time &amp; one can't help but wonder if he's playing his character or if he's doubting his involvement in this movie.  The actors who played the Navajo's codebreakers are genuine &amp; fresh in their roles &amp; they are convincing in their performance.  This movie is over 2 hours long &amp; one could wish for a tighter script.  Even the love interest of Nicholas Cage doesn't go anywhere.  Their relationship isn't explored fully but simply gone with the wind.  A mediocre effort from an A class director.  He's definitely out of his element &amp; just hope that we haven't seen the best of his works yet!

B00006HBUB|4.0|I had heard so many negative things about this movie that it took me a long time to gain the courage to watch it.  I'm glad I did.  While Freddie Prinze, Jr., and Sarah Michelle Gellar appear initially miscast as Fred Jones, and Daphne Blake, by the end of the movie you can sort of see it.  The real winners here are Matthew Lillard in his best role ever as Shaggy and a digital Scooby-Doo.<br />The beginning of the movie find the team of ghost hunters split up due principally to the personalities of Daphne and Fred.  Scooby and Shaggy are, as usual, interested in food, surfing, and food, remaining true to themselves.  The owner of an island amusement park invites all of them, separately, to the island to help solve a mystery.  After the not-quite-together team realizes there is a real mystery, the five some slowly grow together into the best team they have ever been.<br />The plot of movie is relatively unimportant.  We have seen plots similar to these in dozens of animated Scooby Doo cartoons.  We loved them.  You will recognize the essence of those plots in this movie.<br />I was initially uncomfortable with how Daphne and Fred were played.  I was expecting both characters to act more as they were in the cartoons.  However, as the movie progressed I saw the method to the director's madness, and while I can't say I was ever thrilled by what I saw as a significant deviation from the cartoon characters, I tried not to get hung up on it.  I supposed I should have been uncomfortable with Scrappy Doo whizzing on Daphne, but I was never a big fan of Scrappy anyway.<br />I have yet to mention very little about Linda Cardellini as Velma.  After Matthew Lillard's Shaggy, Linda's Velma was the next best portrayal of the Mystery, Inc., team.  Just as Matthew Lillard was Shaggy, Linda Cardellini was Velma.  Interestingly, Velma, always played as the brainy, somewhat geeky, type, is the same here, yet Linda Cardellini somehow brings a beauty to Velma that was never in the animated shorts.<br />The real charm of this movie comes from Matthew Lillard.  I have seen him in so many movies, including others with Freddie Prinze, Jr., and while his characters were often done well, he is outstanding as Shaggy.  I think the true star of this film is Matthew Lillard, followed by the digital Scooby.  Every time I watched Matthew, it was as though Shaggy had come to life.  Matthew talked like Shaggy, walked like Shaggy, he even LOOKED like Shaggy.  He was perfect.  Matthew and his best friend Scooby were cartoons come to life.<br />Without Shaggy, Scooby and Velma, this movie would have been a disaster, perhaps not even making two stars.  The three of them save the day and create the real humor and chemistry of the live version of the Mystery, Inc., team.ed shorts.<br />The real charm of this movie comes from Matthew Lillard.

B00009XITQ|4.0|My daughter and wife both forced me to watch this movie.  Truthfully, I actually did want to watch it because I thought it might be funny, and it looked similar to \\"The Princess Diaries,\\" which I also enjoyed.  I was pleased that the movie turned out to be watchable and fun.<br />Daphne Reynolds is a young woman in New York who yearns to know her father.  As she grows up, she becomes more and more distressed by the possibility that she will never have a chance to know her father.  After watching a father-daughter dance at a wedding one day, she decides it is time to act and go off to find him.<br />Daphne was the result of a romance between her free-spirited mother, Libby Reynolds (Kelly Preston), and Henry Dashwood (Colin Firth), who once was as free-spirited as Libby, but ultimately succumbed to the prim and proper expectations of the British upper class, and Libby was left behind.  Unbeknownst to Henry, he left Libby with a gift:  Daphne.  In case you were wondering, Libby and Henry were legally married in Morocco, though various characters attempt to obscure the legality of that marriage.<br />Daphne has entered the scene at a very critical point in Henry Dashwood's life.  He has given up his hereditary position in the House of Lords to run for elected office.  Most especially interested in his success are Alistair Payne (Jonathan Pryce), Glynnis Payne, his fianc&eacute;, and Clarissa Payne.  Naturally all three of these characters want what's best for them, and not what's best for Henry.  Dahne's free-wheeling ways do not sit well with any of these three characters, and they impress upon Henry that to win the election he needs to bring Daphne back under control.<br />Daphne succumbs to the pressure of being the daughter of British royalty and becomes the beautiful, dutiful daughter, and adopts a type-B personality demeanor.  We all know that Daphne's irrepressible energy and type-A personality will have to win out, and remaining the meek, dutiful daughter is not her path.<br />As with a recent, similar movie, \\"The Princess Diaries,\\" this movie has a fair amount of predictability, clich&eacute; and stereotype.  However, as with the earlier movie, this movie too is a winner.  The real success in this case is from Amanda Bynes and her interaction with Colin Firth.  Colin sees in Amanda the person he truly is, and he sees that he similarly stifled his true character to fit into the expected mold.  Amanda has virtually no interest in Colin's position or wealth.  She is who she is; her real goal has always been to gain a father, not money or status.<br />We love Daphne because she is a bit eccentric, but she is all-American, and engagingly normal.  We find by the end of the movie that being pretentious should not be a cover for whom or what we want to be.  Sure, the plot is contrived, but who cares?  It's way too much fun to worry about such trivialities.  Enjoy!path.<br />As with a recent, similar movie, \\"The Princess Diaries,\\" this movie has a fair amount of predictability, cliché and stereotype.

B00008H2LB|1.0|Listen to real music. Nirvana, Neil Young, Bob Marley, The Beatles, etc. Listen to any of the above and realize that Linkin Park is not any good. Save yourself the time and money and avoid this. You'll thank me in 2 years.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Just had to weight in with the chorus.  Everything about this 2-DVD set is a standout, from the package design (and not just one inside booklet but TWO) to the quality of the video and audio.<BR>If you're a Zeppelin fan, you can't go wrong with this.<BR>With most concert DVDs, I watch them once or twice and up on the shelf they go (e.g, The Who Live at the Isle of Wight DVD).  But this one keeps me coming back -- there's 5.5 hours of material on these two discs!<br /> Jimmy Page himself oversaw the remastering of the video and audio.  I have to admit to having forgotten a bit about the ol' Zep.  One tends to get cynical when you hear their music in Nissan car ads.  But that's what makes this DVD set remarkable:  you're reminded of all the great MUSIC they made, both heavy (&quot;Rock-n-Roll&quot;, &quot;Kashmir&quot; etc.) to light (&quot;Going to California&quot;, &quot;That's the Way&quot;).  Funny though how Page's wha-wha-wha with the bow during &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; looks so masturbatory to me now -- back in high school I thought it was the coolest thing ever (and you better like that song -- there are multiple versions on this set).<br />I also enjoyed the menus where there's archival footage and music that wasn't complete and thus not used in the actual concert footage.  The interviews included don't shed much light on Messers Page, Plant, Jones or Bonham (though the last two come across very aristocratic and articulate -- those bassists and drummers don't get enough pressime!).<br />In sum:  if you've ever enjoyed Led Zeppelin's music, you have to watch this at least once, if not multiple times.
B00005OAIE|1.0|I find it extremely hilarious that the media hypes this guy up to be some sort of intelligent singer/songwriter who people should take seriously. This music is flat-out sappy, saccharine, safe, middle of the road junk. It's for the suburban, trendy, crowd who don't like to be challenged musically because their brains are incapable of handling it. The song &quot;Your Body is Wonderland&quot; wreaks of Michael Bolton! John Mayer is too feminine. He plays the sensitive type to attract mindless legions of female fans who know jack about real music!! Oh well, while the mainstream crowd keep listening to this sappy pop piffle i'll stick to my Nirvana, Bob Marley, Beatles, The Clash, albums. You know....music that's innovative and creative? Something sorely missing in todays mainstream music culture.
B00007ELEL|1.0|All of my friends have raved to me about this movie, and I finally watched it.  It was just awful!  There is no plotline, no likeable characters, and absolutely no point to this huge mess of a movie.  None of the eccentric characters are even close to funny, and I found myself wondering why in the world they agreed to make this picture.  Julianne Moore is a great actress, but she has absolutely no function in this film.  John Goodman is great at what he does, but in this all he does is run around yelling, bowling, and screaming about Vietnam.  Jeff Bridges just wanders around in his bathrobe for 2 hours muttering &quot;man, ya know, man&quot;.  And then there's poor Steve Buscemi - a wonderful character actor normally, but his character here is only allowed to say half his lines before Goodman's character tells him to shut up.<br />And the plot...what plot?  This movie had no development or climax...it just kind of ended, leaving me wondering what other worthwhile things I've could've done in the 2 hours I used to watch it.  But maybe it's just me...my friends sat around and laughed throughout the entire movie, why I will never understand...
B0000019PA|5.0|It is no easy task trying to describe original music to someone who has not heard it. Let alone emphasizing the beautiful music they might be missing out on if they don't already own or don't  purchase this album. Yes, it is true taste is a relative thing, it's very personal, so with that said all I can say is: Out of the 500 plus records and CD's I own \\"The Aeroplane over the sea\\" is quit simply one of my favorites! If I could give it 6 stars I would! I own this album in two forms, CD and vinyl and I'v listened to it hundreds of times while uncontrollably singing along until utter exhaustion. Jeff Mangum is the mad-genius behind this bizarre acoustic-folk-fuzz rock band. He is a song writer who paints abstract pictures with his words. And the songs are so weird yet catchy you can't help.....but to sing along, even though you don't now what the hell you're singing about.                                                                I just recieved my 10th anniversary edition of Magnet Magazine and to no surprize this album was there #1 choice for the best of the best albums to come out in the last TEN YEARS!!!  Of course, I can't lie a smile of reasurence spread across my face when I first saw that this album was there #1 choice as well. Magnet writes; \\" Mangum's guitar accomplishes as much with the chords F,G and C as Mexican cuisine does with beans, rice and Flour.\\"                                                               Now the sad news. According to Magnet Jeff has turned in his guitar for his computer creating sound collages and insists fragments are better than wholes. He is an artist in the truest form. I read once that Jeff was once in the circus he writes childrens books and was currently working on a documentary film on the life of snails. Being an artist myself i understand the desire to explore every creative outlet. However, when a talent such as he puts out an album of this magnitude it's unfortunate, sad and a form of mild torture that he has not put out anything since this 1998 release and furthermore may never play or preform music ever again. But lets be thankful that at the very least he has given us this beautiful collection of songs!!!
B00008CLOA|5.0|Okay, How many of you own Pink Floyd: Darkside of the Moon on Quadraphonic 8-Track? Hm-m-m. not many eh? Okay, How many of you own the SQ Quadraphonic vinyl version of DSOTM? A few more hands go up. Well, then you must have found the homebrew Quad version (4ch) going around on the net a year or two back? No? So, we see only a select group of people in the world have another playable version of this Quad intended performance... so let's get real, if you want the Surround Sound (Multichannel) version, this is the one. Doesn't matter if you don't own SACD yet, there's a stereo version included to enjoy (Hybrid).<BR> <BR>As for the quality... I would say after owning All of the above versions, this is by far the best. Why? Because it isn't old and obsolete! Even if you did have the Quad tape/record, it takes a beating everytime you take it out and play it (assuming you still can), so who wants to risk loss on such a collectible? Combine today's music editing tools and modern playback electronics and we get the cleanest and finest performance of this classic to date.  <BR>This is why I believe DSOTM on SACD is the best multichannel format to own of all (and maybe the only one available for most). <BR>Here is an ageless recording... with every small note and voice exposed in 5.1 Surround Sound, to bring a few shivers, and maybe a few tears.<br />The whole release is suberb, but...<BR>&quot;Us &amp; Them&quot; is worth the price of admission alone! (Big Smile!)
B00005JKN9|1.0|I admit, I am an all or nothing film lover.  3/4 of this tragic waste of fabulous sets, costuming and acting talent should have landed on the cutting room floor.  Of course, should that have happened, Scorsese would not have been able to justify his Epic sized budget to the the studio.  I felt absolutely nothing for any character in the film, which is sad indeed, because somewhere in the decidedly unpoetically executed script there was an excellent original tale about the U.S.
B000089RVX|5.0|this is by far the best, most impressive, and most addicting CD I have encountered. The more I hear it, the more I like it. The instruments fit together like a jigsaw puzzle. Amy Lee's vocals are astounding. the lyrics are deep and thougthful, unlike so much of what I hear today
0066214122|2.0|While I found some parts of the novel to be rather far-fetched,  I found many good explanations of an emerging technology and its potential dangers.  I would have liked to have read this book to my 11 year old son who would have been fascinated.  Unfortunately, the book is filled with foul language which, in my opinion, does nothing to enhance the story or the message that it carries.  I am disapponted that a writer of his caliber should find it necessary to do this and I find that it detracts greatly from the book.
0062502182|5.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said about this author? He is truly a man of wisdom and this is evident to us as we read through his writtings. When I first read the alchemist there was such a deep feeling of inspiration, and understanding within me. The part I enjoyed most about the book is that it gave us a different view of God. This book allows us to view God as having <BR>a sense of humor! I loved the book and can recommend it to those seeking to find a deeper meaning to life, themselves and God. I have also read the pilgrimage and By the River Piedra I Sat Down and Wept, more of Coelho's great and deep writtings.
B00009ATIX|3.0|Why would anyone want to remake Tarkovsky's masterpiece?<br />Maybe it was Cameron's idea - his remake of 'A Night to Remember' was fairly well received, despite the extraneous love story. Although I suspect it was saved by its special effects.<br />The original Solaris was glacially paced, mysterious and atmospheric.<br />The remake is slow, irritating and derivative.<br />Buy the original, rent this one and make your own comparison.
B000002J0B|5.0|this is a very fun album to listen to because of the immense variety of styles. you have prog-rock (TSRTS, No Quarter, Dancing Days) funk, (The Crunge) reggae, (D'yer Mak'er), acoustic epics (The Rain Song) and trademark led zep rock (OTHAFA, The Ocean). This was a very good follow-up to Untitled, it may even be superior to it.
0345340426|5.0|I LOVED L-O-V-E-D this book. It is the ultimate fantasy adventure series. I have read and re-read these books a total of 7 times. Tolkien creats a believable world and plot with materiel, that in anothers less talented hands, would have been beyond laugh-able. The Hobbit is a little more tame and I enjoyed it slightly less, but it sets up for the trilogy nicely. It is about the adventures of a hobbit named Bilbo and his dwarven compainions. The Lord of the Rings trilogy is about a hobbit named Frodo, Bilbo's second cousin twice removed, Gandalf the wizzard, and a mirad of other charecters. Each of them are described in amazing detail. Anyway basicaly an old evil is arising and trying to take over middle earth once more and the only way to stop it is to destroy it's &quot;power base&quot; (my only way of describing it!) For all who have not yet read this series I would more than highly suggest it.... It is beyond a classic and I have read more than my share of classics.
B00000K3CR|5.0|I've had this movie (on VHS) since it was first released, and its on my Movies I Can't Stop Watching list.  Tom Hanks portrays a 13 year old boy, Josh, who wakes up in the body of a 30 year old man after wishing he were bigger after not being allowed on a carnival ride and being made fun of by a taller boy.  Although this theme is not unique, nobody but Tom Hanks ever gets it quite right.  Hanks obviously has not forgotten what it's like to be an adolescent boy, and the results are hilarious!  His reactions to adult situations (a really aweful tux at a formal party, making gagging noises and spitting out caviar, playing with all the buttons in the limousine, thinking his workmate just wants to SLEEP when she asks to stay overnight and innocently replying,\\"Well, ok, but I get to be on top\\" -  meaning the top of his bunkbed) never fail to send me into fits of laughter. On the more serious side, Hanks also poignantly portrays the fear and loneliness of a young boy suddenly thrust into the hostile environment of a trashy hotel (the only place he could afford, with the help of his best friend), where sirens, gunshots, and fights are happening right outside his door. Jared Rushton is perfectly cast as his best friend, and gets a good laugh of his own when he screams his bloody head off when first approached by the adult Josh, thinking he's a pervert bent on doing him harm.<br />Great for anybody who remembers what it's like to be a child in a hurry to get bigger, and even for those who don't.

0891349553|5.0|This is a wonderful book that I gave as a gift to my dad.  He is very artistic and loves sculptures.  He was overjoyed at receiving this book and is very anxious to start on his first project.  Every project has simple to follow step-by-step instructions.  But keep in mind, as with any hobby, there is a lot of materials that you will need to buy in order to complete the projects.
B00009XITP|4.0|There are a lot of pre-teen movies coming out these days, and while the storylines are nothing new, the trick is to find one that isn't forced, and where the acting and setting makes the movie enjoyable.<br />I'll be the first to admit Amanda Bynes wasn't my fave actress before watching this movie, but I think its one of the best ones out there.  Her acting is for the most part fluid and funny, and there are many moments that make you laugh out loud.  The cast of characters surrounding her, including Colin Firth (Bridget Jones Diary) enhance her own preformance, and who doesn't love a movie set in England?<br />The story is basically about a teenage girl who longs so much for her father, that when given enough information about him, she makes a surprise trip to England to visit him.  His political upper crust lifestyle is nothing like Daphne's (Bynes) own, which consists of living in China Town with her hippie mom.  Watch as Daphne grows up, learns a few lessons, clashes and blends cultures, deals with bratty future step-siblings, and falls in love.  A cute movie that is enjoyable, to say the least.
B00005JM09|2.0|this movie went into the wrong direction from the first five minutes. unlike the legendary t2 . t3 in my opinion had horrible and excessive oneliners that make a 2 year old smart. the acting was horrible with the exception of shwarzenegger. the personalities of haracters in t2 such as john connor seem to be forgotten and the characters seem to be running in circles with out any thought. what made t2 so great was the dark atmosphere which appeared only once in t3 and i will not give away any spoilers. the director made a bad choice by not following james camerons style and it learly shows. also many of the action scenes are pointless and don't have th flow that t2 had.it was just action scene after action scene with no real story to go between it.
0385504209|4.0|A Harvard history professor's research into secret sects symbols funnels into a personal quest for the Holy Grail.<br />There are enough twists and turns to make this book difficult to put down.  But there are too many coincidences for my taste to rate five stars.
0142000663|5.0|Grapes of Wrath is a very different book I have read from many others. I'm a high schooler, and I usually read cheesy romantics and books for teens, so it took me a long time to get into this book. It starts out slow, (actually very slow) and it kind of gets repetitve in the sense of that they're in the great depression, they're tired, hungry, and they want to get a job. Then you get into two thirds of the book, where they live in a nice camp with actual toliets that flush, hot showers, etc. and it all starts to come from there. The hardships the Joads family has to make, and how Ma is more like the dad of the house, and keeps everyone going and under control.<br />The ending was very... different. It just sort of ended, just like to Kill a Mockingbird.<br />This is probably one of my top ten books, and just like other classics, it takes a while to get into.
078322687X|5.0|The Breakfast Club ranks as one of the '80's best! The innocence of the 80's is captured wonderfully in this movie as well! It featured an absolutely perfect cast with a great soundtrack to boot. You can't ask for more! I watch this today and love to reminisce that whole era. The teen movies today cannot hold a candle to this or any of the other &quot;brat pack&quot; teen movies of then. I need not elaborate on this as I'm sure you all know. My favorite character was played by Molly Ringwald. She is fantastic! If you do not own this on DVD it is a must have!
B00005QZWI|5.0|&quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; soundtrack is alone a masterpiece and wonder, not even considering the awesome film it is written to accompany.  In &quot;The Propechy&quot; you hear the choir chanting very dark, powerful music meant for the prologue of 'Fellowship'.  &quot;Concerning Hobbits&quot; introduces the famous, but simple, Hobbit theme.  &quot;The Shadow of the Past&quot; introduces us to Mordor and the forces of Sauron and their themes.  Much of the Ringwraith theme continues through &quot;Flight To The Ford&quot;.  Then we are introduced to &quot;Rivendell&quot; with another potent, wonderful theme.  At this point we also hear another full version of the Hobbit/Shire theme.  This is also the point at which the Fellowship theme (heroic, brass theme) forms.  As the members join the Fellowship in &quot;The Council of Elrond&quot; we hear the theme in it's fullest version, continued through to &quot;The Bridge of Khazad-dum&quot; where we hear it in it's fullest, loudest version.  In &quot;Lothlorien&quot; we are introduced to the music of the Elves of Lorien, very different from that of Rivendell Elves.  In track 16, &quot;Amon Hen&quot; we hear Aragorn's theme for the first time, in a very perilous form.  (The end of Track 14 of &quot;The Two Towers&quot; is a more cheerful version.)  My personal favorite, saved for the last, is &quot;The Breaking Of The Fellowship&quot; where we hear the LOTR theme and the Hobbit theme.  This track fades seamlessly into &quot;May It Be&quot;, performed and composed by Enya.  This is a perfect song for the end of a great soundtrack and great film.
0393317552|4.0|Historians generally have an inferiority complex:  history is part of the humanities, and for centuries historians have tried to make their subject matter more scientific.  This is the first book which actually succeeds.  It is not your typical history book as it is based on the sciences of ethnobotany, ethnobiology and genetics.  It attempts to address the question of *why* has Euroasian civilization been so successful.  The book demolishes all racist arguments, i.e., that European civilization has reached its dominating position as a result of innate abilities of its citizens.  Instead, Professor Diamond convincingly argues that it is the prevalence of domesticable plants and animals that are the core factors leading to the development of civilization, and from thence the guns, germs and steel of the title.  The only reason I did not give this book five stars is because it bogs down a bit in the later chapters; Diamond tries too hard to support his theses which have already been adequately presented.
B00007BH5C|5.0|Howard Shore's score for &quot;The Two Towers&quot; is nothing short of a gleaming masterpiece.  Every dollar you pay for is worth it!  Here are the highlights of each track:<BR>FOUNDATION OF STONE:<BR>Awesome choral music as Gandalf battles the Balrog.<BR>THE TAMING OF SMEAGOL:<BR>Hobbit theme, Gollum fighting the hobbits music.<BR>THE RIDERS OF ROHAN:<BR>Rohan theme as Theoden draws his sword after being healed.  Hardinger fiddle accompanies and sounds great!<BR>THE PASSAGE OF THE MARSHES:<BR>Awesome eerie music for the Death Marshes!<BR>THE URUK-HAI:<BR>The Fellowship theme, the Isengard theme, the Mordor theme all in one!<BR>THE KING OF THE GOLDEN HALL:<BR>More Rohan music including Eowyn's theme!<BR>THE BLACK GATE IS CLOSED:<BR>Perilous music as Frodo, Sam, and Gollum come to the gate of Mordor.<BR>EVENSTAR:<BR>Beautiful music featuring Isabel Bayrakdarian.  This will put you to sleep with its awesome beauty and sadness.<BR>THE WHITE RIDER:<BR>The awesome theme for Gandalf the White!<BR>TREEBEARD:<BR>Some weird xylophone stuff for the Ents.<BR>THE LEAVE TAKING:<BR>A melancholy version of the Rivendell theme as the Elves leave.<BR>HELM'S DEEP:<BR>Awesome battle music/emotional parting of Eowyn and Aragorn before the Warg battle.<BR>THE FORBIDDEN POOL:<BR>One of the slower, softer tracks.<BR>BREATH OF LIFE:<BR>Some distinct music for the return of Aragorn from the cliff incident.  His theme is at the end in full form!<BR>THE HORNBURG:<BR>Beautiful Rohan theme, Lothlorien theme as the Battle of Helm's Deep begins.<BR>FORTH EORLINGAS:<br />My favorite track with the Rohan theme, Fellowship theme, and beautiful music as the Rohirrim ride into battle topped of with Gandalf's theme!<BR>ISENGARD UNLEASHED:<BR>Chromatic scales as Isengard is flooded.  Awesome!<BR>SAMWISE THE BRAVE:<BR>A rendition of the Lord of the Rings theme as Sam narrates at the end and the Battle for Helm's Deep is won.<BR>GOLLUM'S SONG:<BR>A distinct, beautiful song for Gollum topped off with fanfare (Eowyn, Rohan).<br />This is a WONDERFUL soundtrack!  If you appreciate good orhcestra music you won't regret buying this soundtrack!
B00007BH3Y|5.0|I should admit at the outset that I am an unabashed fan of the works of Philip Glass.  I believe he is one of the most important composers of the latter half of the 20th century.  He has made a good start towards being one of the most important composers of the first half of the 21st century, and his score for _The Hours_ is ample evidence.  Many listeners have trouble with Glass's music, and I believe this is the reason the score for _The Hours_ lost out to Eliot Goldenthal's score for _Frida_.  There is no question in my mind that _The Hours_ is the superior work and should have won the Oscar.  However, with the members of the Academy being as notoriously conservative as they are, it was no surprise that the score for _The Hours_ did not win.  This score warrants frequent replaying, unlike most scores which bear only a few listenings before it is put away.  For those who find Glass's music daunting and incomprehensible, Glass's score for _The Hours_ should be given a chance.  It is one of the most accessible works Glass has written, and is deserving of a broader audience.
B000002H4Q|5.0|This excellent album was my first introduction to The Cure.  The album opens with \\"The Kiss\\", a haunting six-minute epic that serves as a fitting prologue of what's to come.  There's all sorts of different music styles, ranging from the entrancing bassline of \\"Like Cockatoos\\" to the sitar in \\"If Only Tonight We Could Sleep\\".  Whenever I hear \\"Just Like Heaven\\", I can't seem to wipe the idiotic grin off my face.
B00006LLNV|4.0|Although I am a huge fan of Philip Glass' work, and I was very disappointed that his score for _The Hours_ did not win an Oscar, Eliot Goldenthal's score is a worthy competitor.  Unlike many film scores, this one bears repeated listening.  &quot;Burn It Blue&quot; in particular is a breathtakingly dramatic piece of work and the highlight of this score.  If the rest of the score lived up to &quot;Burn It Blue&quot; then there would be no question in my mind that this score was the most deserving of the Oscar.  Some of the weaker numbers, in contrast to the consistently strong work of the score for _The Hours_, make this a less compelling work.  However, the members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences are notoriously conservative, and, in the final analysis, the score for _Frida_ is more accessible than that for _The Hours_.  Given the difficulty of Glass' music, it is no surprise that the score for _Frida_ won the Oscar.
B000001GPX|5.0|I have heard a number of Fifths and Kleiber's version is still the best one so far.  Masterfully conducted and beautifully played.  As far as the Seventh goes, I have also heard a few of this symphony and I think it's one of the best out there as well.  However I can't honestly say it's my favorite Seventh (my heart keeps reminding me of the joyful, eloquent, and underrated version by Bruno Walter).  Nevertheless, Kleiber's Seventh is still great.<br />You often get one great piece that comes with a sloppy or mediocre piece.  It is not often you can find two extremely magnificent renditions on one single disc.  This is the main reason why I have given it 5 stars-- AT A BARGAIN no less.

B00007KQA3|2.0|I read the book 1984 and then months bought the movie.  I would highly suggest that you rent it before buying it.  If I did I sure wouldnt't be writing this review and complaining to everyone how terrible they made the movie.  They could have done such a better job with it.  But I guess thats what you get when hollywood tries to make a movie from a book.
B00006LLNU|5.0|Never before have I encountered an album that not only intrigues me, but enlightens me as well. Sigur Ros's (), allows one to step outside of the physical reality, and places them into the metaphysical realm. Listening to the beginning tracks I found myself closing my eyes recollecting those days that have long since past, and excepting them for what effects they had on my life. If, and when, I go to heaven I envision the cherubins softly chanting the &quot;lyrics&quot; of Sigur Ros to the masses and reassuring one's spirit that all is well, welcoming them to eternal bliss. This album takes one on a journey to spiritual awakening and the to embracement of humanity. Some may say that this is a grandious compliment to Sigur Ros, but listen to this album for yourself, and be asured that your world will be changed for the better.
B00005JMFR|5.0|I think whoever wrote the review before this is on the right track about Neo's powers outside the matrix.  The idea of another ship's EMP is stupid, and a matrix within a matrix is just going to get boring and repetitive.  If there's one thing I've learned form watching Reloaded, its that the Wachowski bros. are definitely fans of anime, and theory of Neo evolving to some new level (most likely from his coming face-to-face with the architect) is very much in the plot style of anime.  Having been in the central \\"command room\\" of the matrix, it is possible that his brain may now be in tune with the signals that control the sentinels and other machines.<BR>There's another factor in play here.  Many of the computer entities (Merovingian, Architect, etc.) keep going on about causality, and how they basically know everything that will ever happen because it's all cause-and-effect.  I've studied causality in college, and this is where Smith is going to become a key factor in how all of this will play out.  As an out-of-control rogue program, he is the only factor the Architect and his \\"minions\\" never took into account (funny how he called the humans a virus only to become one himself).  Whether it will ultimately be for good or ill I do not know, but I have a strong feeling that whetever happens next is going to hinge upon the actions of Smith.
B000075BFK|5.0|what to say bout this album one of his best, who cares if he's dead or alive, its all bout his music, i would rate the CD more than 5 stars, its a must get, both CD's are great to listen to, i would say my favorite songs in the first cd are all of them but my fav fav is still ballin, ride on our enemies and thugz mansion, y are they my fav songs? jus listen to them, on the 2nd cd my fav song is my block remix, which is probably i think the best song out of the 2 cds, its a must get, download the CD or buy the cd(i suggest buying it)
B00009RGBS|5.0|Chicago is, by far, the greatest. It has something in it for everyone: comedy, crime, entertainment. The music is brilliant, the actors are breath-taking, and the story is absolutley fabulous. <BR>  If you buy one movie this year... buy CHICAGO.

B00009W0WM|1.0|A complete waste of money. The \\"newly discovered additional footage\\" amounts to under a minute. The outtakes are of little importance and are mildly entertaining as a curiosity only. <br />Sadly, this set is a shining example of Hollywood trotting out old material (such as the Bacall documentary which has aired many times on TV) on DVD that isn't worthy of a deluxe 2-disc set. Stick to the original 1-disc DVD and use the $10 you saved to buy a DVD of Sharky's Machine. Burt needs the cash.
B00005QB42|5.0|I play this CD almost every single day. I find her voice and the chants so warm and enthralling, I break out in a smile..and my heart opens wide.<br />Someone talked about Zade being better. What a joke....there is no comparison. This woman is inspired. She isn't just mouthing the words.<br />If you want to see her in person and have  a really sacred experience, see her in San Rafael in November 03.
B0000B1OFI|5.0|This is a great movie! I absolutely loved it when it was in the theatre. It was a great cast! Mark Whalberg, Charlize Theron(sp?), Edward Norton, Seth Green, and many others.

0425098532|4.0|Sad Cypress is a Hercule Poirot story that even many Christie fans don't remember which is a pity because it contains two unusual features. First, you have a woman who loves so intently that it's unhealthy. Second, you have a victim who is perfectly blameless and is far more loveable than Poirot's client.  Christie turns this into a psychological drama full of passion, envy, sadness. Poirot steps into the scene almost in mid book but it works. He's the laser sharp light that clears up the mess Elinor, Roddy and the killer have made. Seek this one out.
B000003TA4|1.0|I've never understood what the big deal about Nirvana and grunge was. I was a teen in the 90s, and this music didn't speak to me at all. Rock and roll was developed to be fun, not as a platform to whine about your pathetic life, and how much it [stinks] to be a millionaire. Maybe 80s hair metal had gone over the edge with bands like Guns N Roses, etc., but at least it was fun, and could make you forget about your troubles for a while. And don't tell me you didn't rock with bands like Poison and Motley Crue. You know you did, you're just ashamed to admit it. In general, grunge [stinks].
B00005OAIE|5.0|I love this CD.  It has definitely become one of our &quot;classics&quot; in our home and vehicles!  John Mayer's lyrics are so meaningful and touching.  &quot;83&quot; really takes me back.  This &quot;30-something&quot; loves his music!

B000066C1N|5.0|I bought this CD for my 3-yr old daughter who loves &quot;Spirit&quot;, the movie.  I have to admit that we both sing the songs together.  The music is beautiful.  While I love the duet with Sarah Mclachlan, my daughter loves &quot;Get off of My Back&quot;!  Great CD!
B0000AXE8I|5.0|\\"WOW\\" as Neo said in the first one is the only way to describe this movie. the wraiths are great.
B000002LR6|4.0|Never has so beautiful a work been so terrifying to behold - or is it the other way around? With this late-industrial masterpiece, Ministry makes a bold statement: brutality and beauty can coexist at the same time. The nature of this merge is fragile and tenous - the balance is lost with \\"T.V. Song\\" and is almost lost during \\"Jesus Built My Hotrod\\"  and \\"Hero,\\" but with only one low spot and two songs that are, at worst, a tad pro forma, this release deserves every bit of praise that comes its way - and more.  By focusing as much on the lush sonic backgroud as to the brutal pounding fore, Ministry turned out a CD that was as sensitive as it was sardonic.
B00005JMD3|3.0|Good action film, quite entertaining...yet wouldn't say its my favourite.  Have no specific complaints...I'm just not as \\"involved\\" into movies like some are.  I'm sorry, I won't get offended if a movie doesn't have a perfect dialogue and such.  Regarding the movie itself, go for it!

0026009102|5.0|In this humanizing work, Ms Rand, with typical objectivity and lack of hateful editorial voice, explores a maligned and troubled member of modern society - the sociopath. A sociopath, for readers not studied in psychiatry, can lie without any rise in nervousness, has difficulties relating to or empathizing with others, and may be prone to violence. For obvious reasons it is a hard disorder to detect and indeed, many sociopaths are economically successful. Understandably, the sociopath has historically rarely been presented as anything other than the most cardboard of villains, and it is this wall that Ms Rand breaks down in her opus the Fountainhead, where - perhaps relying on the experience of an afflicted brother or aunt - she shows a heterodox, humanized conception of such a person, whose condition causes as much pain to himself as it causes him to, unwittingly, cause to those around him.<BR> <BR>Howard Roark is the protagonist of this tale, and the author never wavers from he strict first-person viewpoint, so much that she never explicitly mentions sociopathy. Howard Roark is - at least by his own dubious account - a brilliant architect screwed by The Man, and views himself as misunderstood, hardworking, and honorable. This is the supreme tragedy of the work - isn't full of just the smug self-assurance we expect but a desperate, burning desire to know of his own moral rightness. Possessing an adolescent's desire to buck the authorities, be original, and simply be a badass all-around, the reader also comes to realize that Roark, although he will never admit it, also possesses the child's need for parental approval of his being good, in the right. But since he does not believe in God and refuses to admit his vulnerability to any other person, he has only one way to turn - himself. Science has yet to validate whether complex psychological causes like this, or some defect of genes, or a chemical imbalance is responsible for sociopathy but this implicit explanation is certainly sufficient for literary purposes. There are overtones of paranoia as well, and some of the most heartrendering scenes involve his imagining his percieved \\"enemies\\" conspiring against him in the most cardboard of manners - \\"Blast that Howard Roark! His architectural originality threatens our plans for world domination!\\", etc. - while Roark's train of thought, as represented by the text, is unable to waver from this. Although he initially grates, the sheer annoyance and/or hatred one holds against him eventually gives way to sympathy, much like the sympathy any decent human being feels for Gene Ray, the troubled founder of Timecube.com.<BR> <BR>Unlike many of the clichd novels which chronicle some person's descent into depravity, Roark is neither aware of, nor in control of, his actions and the harm that they cause, and so even as he proceeds from mere rudeness, to raping a woman, to blowing up a building, he is fundamentally innocent. He is not evil, merely just another victim of his own disease - for instance, when he rapes Dominique, he sincerely believes that she wants him to, even as she explicitly says \\"no\\" and he physically overcomes her. Milton's Lucifer invented elaborate intellectual justifications for his narcissistic rebellion, and so does the windy Roark - indeed, his most common act of unconscious sadism may be in the boredom-inducing speeches he is prone to give, and that Rand forces the reader to endure these is an ultimately rewarding experience as it personalizes the pain that he causes. But Milton was never so fully (perhaps for his own sanity; Rand has unselfishly cast off such concerns in pursuing her compassion for all persons) committed to the character, but neither does it romanticize or try to give crecedence to its narrator's justifications, and that may be why the Fountainhead is the righteous successor to Paradise Lost. For one of the most courageous and complex literary acts of the century - as well as a call for greater public commitment to the treatment of our most vulnerable brothers and sisters, the mentally ill, and if the tragic \\"not guilty\\" verdict was any indication, reform the legal system to ensure that sociopaths are not allowed to slip through the cracks of the legal system but find a safe home in publicly-funded institutions - I heartily recommend the Fountainhead.

B00005QGAZ|5.0|Nobody can make &quot;smelly jelly&quot; quite like Michael Jackson and &quot;Thriller&quot; is the album that proves it (besides &quot;Off the Wall&quot;). I honestly never bought the LP or the CD. But one day I decided to buy the special edition CD and it sounded so good with the vocals, the beats, the horns, the bass, the synthesizers, the works! It was also very interesting to hear interviews by producer Quincy Jones and songwirtewr Rod Temperton (I didn't know he was British!) about the making of &quot;Thriller.&quot; &quot;Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'&quot; is very dancable; &quot;Baby Be Mine&quot; is groovy; &quot;The Girl is Mine&quot;, a duet with Paul McCartney is sweet and innocent; &quot;Thriller&quot; is funky and scary at the same time; &quot;Beat It&quot; is simply rockin'; &quot;Billy Jean has the &quot;jelly&quot; with bass, drums, guitar and real strings; &quot;Human Nature&quot; is mellow; &quot;P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)&quot; co-written and co-arranged by Quincy Jones is very funky and dancable; And finally &quot;The Lady In My Life&quot; is slow and smooth. I think this is the best work by Quincy Jones because it's the biggest selling album of all time and won eight Grammys. Everytime I listen to the CD, I keep thinking about Chris Tucker doing the songs because he can turn &quot;smelly jelly&quot; into &quot;smoked jelly&quot;. Buy the special edition CD together with Q: The Autobiography of Quincy Jones (that's what I did!). You'll explore the wonderfulk world of American music!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The last show in the series has just been aired over here in England - it leaves me feeling sad that there are no more episodes and happy that I got the chance to see all the existing ones in the CORRECT order ( I see that in America you were unlucky enough to have a disjointed story line and 3 unaired shows!). I can truly say that I have never seen a series to match Firefly's unique feel. A brilliant mix of cutting edge technology, good ol' back to basic Western magic and superb characters who make you want to get to know each one personally! With so many twists and sub-plots the show always leaves you guessing and looking forward to the next. It is therefore sad and frustrating that no second series is yet planned for there are many unaswered questions and great potential for many more exciting plots. <BR>When the Complete Series is released on DVD be sure to buy it and see for yourself that this is possibly one of the best shows every to be aired.

0385504209|1.0|I am a teenager and an avid reader who bought this book because of its excellent reviews.  I found it to be incredibly exciting as I read it, full of interesting twists and turns and secrets revealed.  However, when I recently skimmed several of my favorite passages, I was disappointed to discover that the novel was not nearly as good as I first thought.  The \\"ingenious twists and turns\\" have a great similarity to the action seen in a thousand cheap thriller novels.  Plus, there are certain glaring historical inaccuracies, such as: 1) The book claimed that Jesus was never referred to as divine until a certain council voted on the subject.  Not true.  Jesus said that he was the son of God, his followers said he was the son of God, and many people believed he was the son of God long before the council.  The council was simply to make official what so many people already believed.  2) Langdon refers to Leonardo as a \\"flamboyant homosexual.\\"  Much like Michelangelo, the subject of the great artist's sexual orientation is still under debate.  3) The book seems to regard the presence of...a certain someone...in Leonardo's painting as evidence that....a certain someone....was actually there when the Last Supper took place.  Question:  How can you use the paintings of a man who lived 1500 years after the event as evidence of \\"what really happened\\" at the Last Supper?  Basically, though the book is well-written enough to make you overlook many of its flaws, take religous, artistic, and historical statements with several grains of salt.<br />All of what I've said and more is discussed in an article published in the New York Times, if you care to look it up.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|This is the first CD/songs I have heard of Fleetwood Mac, and I like it very much.  Especially some of the guitar work: amazing.  I can even figure out some of the lyrics :)  Turns out the lyrics are included in the liner (just opened them!)<br />I ordered Rumors, which is supposed to be 'their' album; I look forward to that.<br />BTW: my tastes in music may be very different from others'.  Suffice to say I hadn't heard FM before, I usually listen to the Beatles, Aerosmith.  The CD is of good quality.
B00005JLKB|3.0|When Smallville first debuted, I was initially skeptical of the premise. It was one thing to delve into Clark Kent's psyche (as did the earlier Lois ans Clark) but not being a fan of my own small town existence, I wondered what a pre-Superman cannon addition could seriously offer myself other than brooding good looks.<br />Vauglely remembering the Dukes of Hazzard from my own early childhood, I also wondered what strange grip John Schneider had on hollywood (incriminiating conversations, photos..etc) to cast him as Jonathan \\"Pa\\" Kent, who should (by all accounts) be a heavyset bespectacled older man. Annette O'Toole (Lana from the movies) is a generally agreeable choice for Martha \\"Ma\\" Kent in the tradition of intra-franchise joking, but the two seem too sophisticated for the roles, even by previous series standards which made it clear open-minded people lived in all areas of the country (including small-town family farms).<br />Also problematic is the series repeated inistence that Smallville is only a short distance from Metropolis when it has been previously established on the East Coast (approximately where New York City resides)in numerous earlier Superman incarnations (his being able to travel home in minutes for counseling from the parents).<br />Reeling from Buffy's untimely cancelation, I managed to find some captivating portions of this series which would be memorable for anybody willing to wade through and/or overlook the earlier mentioned nitpicks. This series obviously borrows heavily from the long-established DC franchise, but it also subtlely infuses a healthy dose of sophisticated political commentary.<br />Hinting at the real-life current challenges facing many students with disabilities and/or GLBT students, Clarks parents encourage him to be careful whom he tells the truth about himself to in their small 'close-minded' town and to remember his physical limitations (in his case being stronger than others, and/or staying away from the meteor rocks which dot the landscape and provide much of the challenges). Being different in a small town is different, and periodically stiffling for teens who do not fit a pre-defined cookie-cutter ideal, but internal strength (self esteem) immeasurably helps find your way through (and yourself in) the tourtorous ordeal.<br />Partly as a result of this same leveling experience, Clark develops great empathy for others and concern for social justice---later becoming the famed \\"Man of Steel\\".<br />In one episode which remains eerily reminicent of the real-life murder of University of Wyoming college student Matthew Shepard, Clark is [unclothed] and tied to a fence post by the popular Smallville High jock in retailiation for making eyes at his long-time crush Lana Lang.<br />Because Lana is still in the phase where she wears a fragment of the meteor rock around her neck in memory of her dead parents, Clark cannot physically get near her for most of this season without getting ill.<br />Indicative of his future with Lois Lane (of the Terri Hatcher era), we also meet Chloe Sullivan, the editor of the high school newspaper, the Torch who favors herself a cross between Woodward/Bernstein and Gloria Steinem. Lana's polar opposite in both dress and demeanor, Chloe suspects there is far more going on in the town than what the authority figures are telling her, but cannot yet figure it out despite her most persistent intentions (which are amazingly accurate in many instances). Even at this point in his life, Clark recognizes he is attracted to strong and independent-minded women, but cannot himself figure out how to reveal his idenitity without being reduced to [strange] status on her infamous \\"Wall of Weird\\" and presumably carted away to a research lab. If taking history seriously, he's eventually supposed to go out with Lana, but I really want to see these two together instead and think the resultant generated plotlines would be more interesting.cks which dot the landscape and provide much of the challenges).

B00003CXXM|4.0|If you have read the book, well, you know the story, even if the movie is somewhat adapted.<br />The action sequences are superb, Bourne is established as the best-of-the-best, even though the others sent to hunt him down don't seem as good.  Franka Potente is good, she fits her character as a German-born American.  Matt Damon is good too.<BR>I rented this movie, perhaps one day I will own it too (along with The Matrix!)<br />&lt;SPOILER?&gt;<BR>As for the Collector's Edition, the alternate ending is probably not worth spending extra money (I don't know how much the normal edition costs).  But Widescreen is better, as the movie's supposed to be seen.<br />Maybe they will do a _good_ sequel (unlike Reloaded!), though the ending left me wondering how they would achieve that.<br />Good cast, good director, good movie.
0156027321|5.0|Please can you take the name of the tiger (Richard Parker) OUT of the description of the book 'Life of Pi'- it ruins one of the most wonderful surprises if you know the tigers IS Richard Parker (since the book describes him as if he is a man for the first several chapters!). I notice none of the customers reviews have mentioned his name (and it's purposefully not in the book description on the back cover). Please it's such a spoiler if you know!
6305878323|5.0|Most parents today would take a movie like this, pop it into the player, and let the kids immerse themselves in the enchanting adventure Mary Poppins brings with her, while they go and do what they need to do. But in reality, the parents are the ones that should watch it because underneath the world of carousel horses coming to life and tea parties on the ceiling and &quot;Chim Chim Cheree&quot; there is a very important lesson: you should never be too busy for your kids. Both parents, not just the father, were too invloved in their own things..whether it be Mr. Banks' postition at the bank or Mrs. Banks' crusade for women's rights. Mary, like the nannies before, was basically hired to do the parents' job. There are plenty of instances where the parents prove that they know nothing about their kids. I won't give away the ending, but the parent viewers would definitely be reminded that their kids grow up too fast and that there's no substitute for the love of a mother and father.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|The biggest problem with The Matrix: Reloaded was that it may have been too smart for its audience. Although it tried to cover its bases by featuring lots of action and CGI effects (for which it has drawn much criticism), the heart of the movie lay in the philosophical quandaries drawn for its characters. By philosophical, I don't just mean \\"smart\\" or \\"thoughtful,\\" I mean based on real questions by real philosophers. The motivation for Agent Smith's anger at Neo is that Neo took away the meaning of his existence. Smith is a computer program without a function, without a reason for being. His ire is true existential angst, and the \\"messiah,\\" Neo, is to blame. The overall plot, dealing with Neo's struggles against the prophecies of the computer, will have its resolution hinge upon the philosophical dilemma of free will vs. determinism. Is the future set? Will the actions taken by Neo allow him to step outside prophecy, or are his only options those dictated by a static reality, based on probabilities and statistical anomalies? These are profound questions with which Western philosophy has been grappling for centuries. The last place I expected to see them raised was in a summer action movie, one which tops its style and digital pyrotechnics with a truly intellectually engaging plot. This movie stands out against the rest of the summer's dumbed down, brainless and heartless recycled action flicks. The Matrix: Reloaded isn't just worth seeing, it's worth thinking about.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|This is the first new CD I've purchased since...I can't remember. I'm a major Fleetwood Mac fan so I snatched this up the day it came out and I wasn't disapointed. Of course, being the huge Christine fan I am, I knew that it would sound different and that her presence would truly be missed and maybe finally people would realize how talented and important she is to this band. In fact, at times I forgot I was listening to FM because it just doesn't sound the same especially on tracks like &quot;Come&quot;, an awesome song but totally different from traditional Mac stuff. 18 tracks compared with the usual 10 or so you get nowadays for the same price seems like an awesome bargain but at the same time, it runs a little long. We could have down without tracks like &quot;Red Rover&quot; and &quot;Murrow Turning Over in her Grave as well as a few other Lindseys that I can't even remember.&quot; I love the tracks &quot;Say You Will&quot;, &quot;Smile at You&quot;, &quot;Miranda&quot;, the traditional Stevie-ish &quot;Running Through the Garden&quot; and the beautiful &quot;Goodbye Baby&quot;. All in all, this album sounded like a Stevie solo CD with some Lindsey songs thrown in. It's got some awesome percussion, thanks to Mick who just keeps getting better and better. But it's still a good CD and worth a listen for anyone who loves classic rock.
B00005JSGK|5.0|I first saw Hatari! in a drive-in as a child, and was utterly enchanted by the scenery, Henry Mancini's award winning music, Red Button's comedy, and that hunk Hardy Kruger.  Each time since that I've seen the movie, it's just as enjoyable.  All of the actors are excellent, but I really enjoy the chemistry between Red Buttons and Elsa Martinelli, as they schemed together to win their loves.  Elsa's dance with the Warusha is a stitch, but her bath with three men and a cheetah is not to be missed.<br />The DVD in widescreen (on my 31&quot; TV) is not quite like that summer night at the drive-in, but almost as good.  My speakers are a lot better than the drive-in was...  It's an excellent transfer to DVD.<br />This movie is pure fun.  It's a keeper.
B00005YXZH|1.0|I've given this cd many listens, but I just don't like it. It sounds somewhere in between Pavement's &lt;i&gt;Terror Twilight&lt;/i&gt; and Doves' &lt;i&gt;Last Broadcast&lt;/i&gt;, both of which were far and away, much better albums. I do not approve.
B000002J1U|5.0|Anyone who says that the Zoso album (Led Zeppelin IV, or the untitled album) was the greatest Zeppelin Album, didn't listen to Led Zeppelin III. Sure, IV was catchy, but III was outgoing, original, and only comparable with Houses of the Holy in it's undeniable flow. This album, unlike any other, is beyond the point of just being overlooked, has been denied of its hold one anyone who listens to it. It's the peak of Led Zeppelin's talent and unique personality rolled into 10 masterful songs that not only displayed their deep blues rythm, but their gutsy folk-rock as well. Plant's wailing voice in the 'Immigrant Song', Bonham's rythmic bongo in 'Friends', the eerie charm of Paul-Jones's mandolin in 'Gallow's Pole', and most importantly, the unbridled fury of Robert Plant displayed in every installment on the CD makes Led Zeppelin III the unrivaled Led Zeppelin album. Even though IV is often hailed as the greatest Zeppelin album, III is their most base, and the one that shows them at their full potential more than any other.
B00003CX95|5.0|Hopefully, the furor over THE PASSION will not obscure this, Gibson's masterful account of the life and death of Scottish patriot William Wallace. Short on facts but long on legend, BRAVEHEART is an epic in the grand style of David Lean, possibly the best character biodrama since LAWRENCE OF ARABIA.<br /><br />This Academy-Award winning film, Gibson's directorial debut, is lavish, colorful, and long. Gibson's portrayal of Wallace is mythic, but threaded with a fine appreciation of the human frailties of Wallace, who led his countrymen in a protracted War of Independence against English rule in the early 1300s.<br /><br />Gibson's Wallace is balanced, a leader amongst men who accepts his role and the attendant lionizing that accompanies it, with bemusement and wit. The character of Wallace is nearly the perfect man, being forceful, ruthless, civilized, passionate, crafty, educated, and sensitive as the occasion demands. His slow downfall in the second half of the film (and his horrible death) are envisioned not as failures in the man but as born of a need to believe, even in the face of the treachery and self-interest of others.<br /><br />The Scottish nobles are drawn as amoral and torn between alliance with England and a fractious independence (as they historically were). Although they fail Wallace miserably, he is so convinced of the rightness of his cause that he returns time and again to them to bolster his military and political clout. The vicious betrayal of Robert The Bruce (and his ultimate redemption) is a plot within a plot, and is played beautifully by Angus McFadyen.<br /><br />Gibson's vision of the battle scenes, drawn as they are with hundreds of extras, screaming horses, and gore enough for a teenage \\"slaughter\\" movie, are singularly exciting and propel the film forward at a literal gallop. The bloody-handed Wallace is a vision in violence and determination, and ultimate passion.<br /><br />Fine performances are supplied by Patrick MacGoohan as King Edward \\"Longshanks\\" Plantagenet, Sophie Marceau as the Princess of Wales/French King's daughter, and by Catherine McCormack, who plays Wallace's wife Murron. Murron, and her memory, animate Wallace, and therefore, animate the film. McCormack is angelic and sensual by turns as need demands and carries this brief but crucial role with grace.<br /><br />BRAVEHEART is creatively fictionalized history and fine inspiration. It is a story in which, as Wallace says: \\"Every man dies...not every man really lives.\\"ie Marceau as the Princess of Wales/French King's daughter, and by Catherine McCormack, who plays Wallace's wife Murron. Murron, and her memory, animate Wallace, and therefore, animate the film. McCormack is angelic and sensual by turns as need demands and carries this brief but crucial role with grace.

B00008AY3L|4.0|I love Ben. He is truly a gifted man and has accomplished so much in the music world. My hopes were high when I got this CD, but initally I was disapointed. However after a few times around it grew on me and now its in my rotation daily. Some tracks didnt seem to fit toghether but then I went and saw him play those tracks live and I now have a better apprecation of them. At any rate this is Ben Harper music. Buy it. Its really good.
B00005JM09|5.0|i was definitely surpised by this film, it out-manuevers, out-runs, and out-smarts its two predecessors. i still believe the first terminator was great, this one is better. i still believe that the 2nd terminator was an overhyped waste of film. another thing that caught my eye in this film was its philisophical edge, like its space-time continuim, and inevitability. also, what pushed meaway from the first two were their humorlessness, but dont worry about that, there are plenty on the way. As for the action, i'd have to say it has on of the most excellently choreograghed car chase scene this summer(And thats saying a lot, considering rivals \\"matrix reloaded\\", \\"bad boys II\\", and \\"italian job\\").

B00005JL2O|2.0|I think if the other reviews of Goldmember prove anything, it is that Goldmember is a love it or hate it movie. Personally I loved it in the theater. My gripe is with the DVD, not the movie itself.<br />The first two movie DVD releases were great. They had the movie with commentary tracks and then a special features menu. For some reason, they decided to make the third one different and use the &quot;Infinifilm&quot; gimmick. Personally, I don't care for it. But again, this can be a matter of opinion, as other people seem to really like the way it works, by making many of the special features available during the movie itself.<br />However, there is one unforgivable problem with this DVD - you cannot PAUSE or FORWARD/REVERSE during play of the movie. By itself, this fact makes this DVD unacceptable. If you want to watch Goldmember on DVD, make sure you have 90+ minutes free with no interruptions, because you CANNOT PAUSE THE MOVIE. I cannot figure out what they were thinking.<br />I am hoping there will be another release of this movie. If so, I will buy it and give away the Infinifilm DVD.<br />In short, good movie, terrible DVD.
B0000A4GAK|5.0|The fourth installment from The Derek Trucks Band, Soul Serenade, which was apparently recorded before 2002's Joyful Noise, works as fine a follow-up as I can imagine.  While Soul may rock less than Noise, its eclectic fusing of jazz, rock, Indian, blues, and even folk amalgamate to beautiful results.  <br />These recordings-all-instrumental, save for Track 3, sung by Gregg Allman who's in fine form-are sophisticated compositions that have a discernible melodic structure-sometimes lacking from \\"jam bands.\\"  But to merely call TDTB a jam band would be doing them a disservice.  The jams are never self-indulgent; they have direction and balance.  The musicians have such a tight synergy between them that it appears they've been playing together for a decade or two.  The tunes are at times jazzy: (\\"Bock To Bock\\"), funky: (\\"Soul Serenade/Rasta Man Chant\\"), bluesy: (\\"Drown In My Own Tears\\"), and ethereal: (\\"Oriental Folk Song\\" &amp; \\"Sierra Leone\\").  Despite sounding like a mere rambling of music styles, the songs on the disc actually coalesce into a natural togetherness-creating a unified vibe.         <br />The key word for this band is taste.  They tastefully employ the use of flute (a rather audacious choice that works so well), played by the widely talented Kofi Burbridge.  They tastefully keep their tunes to a reasonable length, never overplaying as far as I'm concerned.  Even the packaging and liner notes (though a bit laconic) show good taste. <br />Like all great art, and I do believe this album exemplifies great art, Soul Serenade is truly original.  But if I had to liken it to something, I'd compare them to Traffic (at their zenith), of course The Allman Brother's Band, and perhaps Wes Montgomery (the late jazz guitarist).  And because it's great art, it's absolutely NOT for everyone.  There are no \\"pop hooks\\" (I loathe that phrase) or riff based songs.  There's no maudlin display of musicianship or image.  There are simply forty or so minutes (I wish there wasmore) of great music.  <br />The last thing I'll say is about Trucks himself.  The CD includes a bonus interview where D.T. offers up his own take on his music.  After watching this, I felt a tremendous respect for him; he is articulate, humble, and wise beyond his years.  It's nice to know there are some artists who know not only what they're doing, but also why they're doing it.
0375422307|4.0|I read this book recently and found it imposible to put it down, I finished reading the first time I picked it up. The author does an excellent job in telling and illustrating Iran's contemporary history, and she does so -I think- quite objectibly, squaring blame not only on the major powers for their share on Iran's internal repression, but also on Iranians themselves. This type of self-examination is a rare thing in Muslim countries, where local media is coerced by the local government or which panders to victimization of Muslims and/or demonization of the West.<br /> Ms. Satrapi paints herself, no doubt, in the best light; as a curious, precocious, insightful child, who sometimes sounds too irreverent and self-aware for a 10 year old. Yet this is perhaps the most compelling aspect of Persepolis, she looks at a complex political transition as a child, yet without sounding over-simplistic. It brought together several key ideas I had read in other more technical books about the Islamic Revolution. She weighs the conflicting messages (so harmful to a child's self-esteem) she received from her parents and society and finds a way to navigate through them. Her parents are middle class idealistic leftists who call for 'equality' but who nevertheless spend vacations in Europe and more or less spoil her. On one ocassion she gets advise from her mother about the need to forgive one's enemies, a few pages later she calls for death to those who tortured her brother in jail. The author, as a child, is besieged by these polarities. Her parents had also welcomed the Islamic Revolution, as secular Iranians did, for the unity they could provide while hoping/expecting their influence to dissipate after the Shah was deposed.<br /><br /> Ms. Satrapi lets the reader understand that she was far from under-priviledged in post-revolutionary Iran. She and her friends find ways to be 'cool' in spite of the vice control police that roamed the city. One understands then that no one, no matter how rich, was safe from the repression that ensued. Her father is harassed for drinking alcohol and she for wearing 'punk' (a.k.a Nike) tennis shoes. At some point her parents have to smuggle posters for her, which would have otherwise been confiscated at the airport by customs (how she thought that Iron Maiden only had four members is beyond me, but we'll let that one go!)<br /> A complaint is that the storming of the American embassy only gets a cursory glance. Surely the tension that aroused from this would have been part of her everyday life, because of the international crisis it provoked, not to mention the failed American military Operation ('Eagleclaw') to rescue them. I also expected her to criticize the hostage takeover. She didn't.<br /> A minor glitch is the story of her uncle, a communist who was exiled to Russia, at some point in his story one is not sure whether he was detained by the police in Russia or in Iran (?).<br /><br /> Yet it is the Islamic Revolution who gets the block of her criticism. She tells examples of how the revolution killed the same revolutionaries who midwifed it to life, her uncle included. How even early on, it had become more repressive than the Shah had been.<br /> This book will benefit those whose only image of Iran (as another reviewer eloquently remarked) is that of terrosists and hostage takers. This book gives a human face to a struggle and repression that most Americans cannot fathom, and in the end, shows us that we are not all that different. Most of all, it paints a picture of life in a regime that stiffles the very air out of its people. A regime this reader hopes is on its last leg, and one whose repression has -contrary to what many believe- made Iran a country where popular support for the West is unparalled.<br /><br /> Don't let the less than perfect score discourage you, this is a funny, uplifting and touching work, truly from the heart. What a wonderful book.how rich, was safe from the repression that ensued. Her father is harassed for drinking alcohol and she for wearing 'punk' (a.k.a Nike) tennis shoes.

B00000IQV7|1.0|This movie is intended to be a charming, witty, uplifting tale of a doctor who sees the whole person in his patients.  What it ends up being is a marathon session of a guy being a dumb jerk to the professionals around him.  I thought the part where his cult-like views get his girlfriend killed was especially charming.  It was a nice touch that he feels sorry for himself and glosses over the fact that it was his ... world-view that got her killed.<br />This movie was bad, not for the style or the directing.  It is bad because of the terrible dogmatic hippiness of its message.  This \\"fight the establishment\\" [material] wasn't useful in the 60's and it is equally trite and puerile now.
B000068OSK|5.0|If you are looking at this it's obvious you've heard of the white stripes and you have one of their CD's.  If you are looking at this because of Elephant, YOU HAVE TO GET THIS CD.  It's amazing.  It sounds like the most smoking bluesy parts of elephant with more guitar and a bit more emotion.  Not that Elephant didn't have emotion, but this being their first album, you can tell he really put a lot into the music.    However, if you are here after White Blood Cells, I would try Elephant or De Stijl before you try this one.  WBC, is their worst album and is kind of out of character for the band.  It's still a good CD, but it doesn't stand up to the masterpiece that is the other 3 CD's.   Jimmy the Exploder starts off really cool and changes to an equally cool sounding riff. The Big Three is a great song about the big 3 auto manufacturers and Jack really gets into the second verse and chorus.  Suzy Lee is an awesome song asking questions we all ask ourselves.  Screwdriver is, in my opinion, the best White Stripes song of all.  It has so much energy, you can see why they play this last at almost all of their shows.  I Fought Piranhas is another great tune.  Overall, I would say that at least 7 to 8 of these tracks are 10 out of 10.  Simply amazing.
B00005JKN9|3.0|This was a so so movie with just a lot of star actors and actresses.  Their perfomance was not poignant, touching, or emotional.  There was nothing thrilling. I had no idea if the director wanted to make the evil character really evil or a good man with a justified reason for what he did.  The ending was incomplete and left me unsatisfied with the movie.

B0000797IO|5.0|that's what i learned from this movie. jennifer anniston , jake gyllenhaal ,  john c riely , and tim blake nelson have superb performances in this rare gem about what more but redemption. i really cared for thes charectors and this movie is one of the best movies to come out in a long time. justine is a lonely  person who's life seems to be going nowhere in between her boring husband and then she meets holden a younger guy and they fall in love dark twisted love that is. towards the end holden becomes obsessed with her and when she decides she doesn't want him the story turns into a tragedy. great movie for everyone. it's got comedy , drama , is kinda erotic , and is just an interesting movie to watch.
B00005JKZV|1.0|Don't get me wrong, The Two Towers is a great movie in its own right, but why are you all marching off the cliff after this piece of junk DVD? You've been through this with the last movie! They put out a normal copy, but then they put out the full movie, which is what you want, on an ultra-expensive \\"extended edition.\\" New Line Cinema's marketers must be sadists. This edition has the special features I want, but it doens't have the full movie I want. The extended edtion will have the movie I want, but also the special features I DON'T. My friend bought the full-extended edition of Fellowship of the Ring for $... and sold me the actual movie discs for $.... I'd call that a better deal. If they make a third-edition DVD of the Two Towers, with the extended movie but normal special features, I'd buy THAT.
0553812173|3.0|Erikson writes well, and no-one can complain that his world is either two-dimensional or stereotypical.  There were two big let-downs for me, though.  Firstly, Erikson's characters, although complex and riddled with conflicting emotion, seem somehow to have lost the link between motivation and action: characters scowl, or grit their teeth for no apparent reason; they gain insights, and seem to say &quot;Aha!&quot;, but these are not shared with the reader, who is left puzzled when the character hurries off to act upon them.  Secondly, the story has the chaotic feel of one where plot developments were determined with the roll of a twenty-sided dice.  Unstoppable forces are conveniently stopped, while new forces appear out of nowhere.  Half the book revolves around the release of a dreadfully powerful character that begins to lumber towards the centre of the action, but gets whisked away (never to return) by &quot;The Gods&quot; before he ever gets there.  Conveniently, someone else pulls another powerful creature almost literally out of his pocket, so we get the big show-down at the end after all.<BR>I didn't much enjoy this book - I struggled along to page 300, then got interested as the action started to pick up, and the characters seemed to gain a bit more consistency for about a hundred pages.  Alas, it all started to fall apart after that, and I finished the book half determined not to read the second installment, and half drawn to give Erikson another chance.  On that decision, the coin is still spinning ...

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Viewers in the UK have been lucky enough to see all the filmed episodes of Firefly, including those not aired in the US. This series just got better and more gripping and more thought-provoking from beginning to end, until the devastating denouement at the end of the last ep (I won't spoil it, wait for the DVD!).<BR>The stories are amazing, turning from farce to tragedy on a pinhead, and back again. The main ensemble characters are universally decent and lovable, for all their faults and secrets. To fully appreciate the economy and genius of the scripts, read them on the web. But what other series has casually dropped in whole lines of script in another language - without translation or subtitles! <BR>This DVD will be a historical document of just how wrong Fox were about their public. We DO deserve TV of this quality, and we will buy this in our millions.

B0000AXE8I|5.0|Obviously, the original \\"Matrix\\" has set the precedent for every action film that has followed it. With the Brothers Wachowski borrowing from classic sci-fi themes crossed with cyberpunk sensibility, futuristic and experimental camera techniques, hyperkinetic Hong Kong/John Woo shoot-'em-ups, and almost ballet-like martial arts choreography from the Master, Yuen Woo Ping helped combine for a film that will always be one-of-a-kind. However, that didn't stop every action film from \\"Charlie's Angels\\" to \\"Cradle 2 the Grave\\" trying to duplicate its gravity-defying fight scenes. The East has influenced the West, for better or worse. How many \\"Matrix\\" clones will there be? The answer is quite a few. But it is not of these blatant rip-offs that I wish to comment on. It is its superior sequel, \\"The Matrix Reloaded\\", which offers not just more of the same but an improvement and expansion on the thematic elements and technical wizardry that made its predecessor unique. Those are where this film succeeds the most. It, like the first film, has the same stale performance from Keanu Reeves, who, as Neo, the prophetic messiah-like hero, has finally found his best use in Hollywood as a human action figure. It also bears another great scene-stealing performance(s) from Hugo Weaving as Smith, Neo's nemesis. But the film's real area of improvement is its use of the ideas of reality, destiny, purpose, and fate. All of these ideas are expanded on and done with more intelligence than the first. There are many more ideas to give your brain a workout rather than just another summer brain rubdown (or worse, a beating, like the ungodly awful \\"League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\\"). Basically, when you leave this film, you are filled with a great many questions, some fascinating ideas, and a sense of foreboding rather than everything tied up in a neat little package, which far too many films this particular summer have had. But not to fail in their always pushing-the-envelope attitude, the Wachowski Brothers have more or less removed the massive gunplay from the first in favor of improving the martial arts sequences. The first really major sequence, which involves Neo fighting a seemingly never-ending swarm of Smiths, is breathtaking to behold. When I get my hands on this DVD, there will be a lot of frame-by-frame use and slo-mo work. Obviously, it doesn't end there. The freeway chase scene that employs all of the various fighting styles and camera tricks and breakneck speed to make for a real edge-of-your-seat adrenaline blast. All in all, it's everything that a sequel should be: bigger, faster, riskier where the stakes are higher and the decisions the characters make have reall causality. There is an effect for all the things that happen. ...wski Brothers have more or less removed the massive gunplay from the first in favor of improving the martial arts sequences.

B00005JLSE|1.0|Chicago is hands down my favorite movie.  The anticipation of the DVD release came to a standstill last Friday.  I opened the tacky case, put the ugly disc in the player, and was highly upset by the content.  This is one POOR DVD!! ONE DELETED SCENE!?!  ONE DOCUMENTARY!?! ONE DISC!?!  COME ON!!    Rob Marshall should have been brought on as director for the DVD release of his brilliant movie.  Disney needs to step up to the plate with their DVD releases and take some cues from FOX or Universal.
B0000A1RJI|4.0|I went to see the movie twice in one day and then my mom bought the CD.  The songs are fabulous!  And you can really remember the film from hearing the soundtrack.  I love number 15 &quot;He's a Pirate&quot; (the main theme) - it's just too short.  And number two is great - I think it's the part where Jack Sparrow first appears coming in on his sinking boat.  :)<BR>I'm giving it four stars because I'm not a great fan of 'dark' music but seeing as this is a pirate movie there has to be some, right?  Otherwise I love the tunes and highly recommend it!
0385504209|4.0|I read this book in two days.  I found it fun, entertaining, enlightening and a great read. One of the fun things about it is the book is full of riddles and puzzles.  When I came to them in the story I tried to solve them before reading on.  Some were simply impossible because they were based on locations or situations within the text but others were approachable.  It really was thrilling to arrive at an answer, read a few more pages and see if your solution was the &quot;right&quot; one.  I got pretty lucky and solved a couple of them.<br />Additionally, because the book is based on historical data it open up new possibilites for the reader to explore while or after reading the book.  So have fun, learn a few things and pick up this book.
0385504209|1.0|If you are a catholic, please dont waste your money in a book that calumniates the Catholic Church with all kind of accusations including murder, fraud and others. Even if you are not catholic but Christian or Muslim, you should know that the author denies the celibacy of our Lord Jesus and other truths of our faith.<br />View of Opus Dei is delirious. Although I am not a member I have known Opus Dei quite enough to make me grin when reading a member committing murder or the Opus Dei Prelate involved in the plot.<br />By the was, almost all the text written in Spanish is full of grammar mistakes, perhaps like this review but at least I dont earn my money writing books.

B0000A1RJI|3.0|This soundtrack was excellent to set the mood for the movie. The CD has approximately 5 minutes worth of beautiful, really good music. However, even those 5 minutes are unoriginal. When I sat in the theatre, I thought: 'This score must have been composed by Hans Zimmer'. For I recognized the theme and rhythm from the movie 'Gladiator'. Then, during the credits, I saw that the composer was Klaus Badelt. Plagiarism? No. This is not art, this is industry. The CD was 'overproduced by Hans Zimmer', who must have been happy to have his Gladiator theme reutilized, and produce decent income. That could (?) compensate him for the oversight at the Academy Awards, when the Gladiator score did not receive an Oscar...<br />The Gladiator soundtrack was one of the best scores I have ever heard (easily surpassing John Williams' loud circus-style scores such as 'Indiana Jones'), and I would say it is a worthy piece in classical music literature, mixing the compositional building style of Beethoven with the sound of Stravinsky. The best part of soundtrack of 'The Pirates of the Caribbean' is the kiddie version of the same theme. It is befitting: the R-rated Gladiator's music had to be edited for the PG-13 audience. The catchy theme  is repeated over and over throughout the soundtrack, and the rest of it (far less enjoyable) is lifted from other movie soundtracks, and serves as a \\"filler\\" that was okay on screen, but not so much for listening pleasure.<br />In spite of these shortcomings, the CD is really enjoyable. My children like it too, and ask for it when we are on the road. It is money and time much better spent than on the \\"music\\" of the Backstreet Boys... At least our children may develop an ear for classical music. You may debate whether the running time of the CD is justified by its contents, but while you are debating the issue, you will have a good time listening.
B000001IPL|5.0|This is without a doubt the best CD the Offspring has put out and one of the best punk CDs ever put out.. You don't believe me? Try it out! This band doesn't get half the recognition they should get.. They're about to put out a 7th album and there isn't one song on any album that I'd skip on the CD.. This is how Smash was put together<br />1) Time To Relax - Your typical Offspring opening.. It's not music, but it's a guy talking (who you hear talk a few times in the album) <br />2) Nitro (Youthy Energy) - Probably the best opening song I've ever heard.. The drums are amazing and (hence the title) the song is very energetic and fast.. This is vintage Offspring and in my opinion their best song on the album 10/10<br />3) Bad Habit - Song starts out really slow but gets quick really fast.. It's one of the singles on the album and is an insane song.. If you've ever been [upset] at another driver while you were out of the road, this is the song for you! 9/10<br />4) Gotta Get Away - A slower song but it has a great beat to it.. The song is on rock radio stations sometimes and is supposed to be one of the best songs on the album.. I like it alot but there are better songs 9/10<br />5) Genocide - A little different sound to it, but it's still a great song.. It's the kind of song you'd hear a die hard Offspring fan singing the chorus to 9/10<br />6) Something To Believe In - It's a loud song and it's a fast song.. Extremely underrated, too.. Probably one of my favorites on the CD 9/10<br />7) Come Out And Play - This is the single.. It's not as hard punk as the other songs but it's a fun song.. This is the \\"Pretty Fly\\" song of the album.. It probably includes one of the most well known lines by the Offspring when the music starts and you hear \\"You gotta keep 'em separated\\" 9/10<br />8) Self Esteem - This song made the album what it is.. Self Esteem is a slow, hard punk song that anyone can get into.. It's also taken as a very seriuous song too and is probably one of the most popular Offspring songs out there 10/10<br />9) It'll Be A Long Time - Good pace.. Not a special song, especially compared to the other songs on the album, but it's still great 9/10<br />10) Killboy Powerhead - A short song but really good.. It's probably the last song on the CD that I got into, but once you get into it, it can become addicting 8/10<br />11) What Happened To You? - Not hard punk like on the album, but it's a fun song like \\"Why Don't You Get A Job?\\" 8/10<br />12) So Alone - This song is kind of a 'let it all out' type of song.. They scream, curse a little.. It's a little over a minute but I love it 9/10<br />13) Not The One - Most people think this is a weak song in the album, but I like it.. I'm hit by their words \\"Yeah, we're innocent, but the weight of the world is on our shoulders.\\" This song really speaks, and I lke it more than most would 9/10<br />14)Smash - This is a great ending.. One of the best songs on the CD .. It's a fast song and has great lyrics.. I think it's just the perfect way for the band to flow into Ixnay, which was their next album 10/10<br />I'd recommend this CD to ANYONE that likes punk rock or rock in general.. The Offspring have been the constant in the punk rock world since the late 80s and if you want to check out their other albums, I'd most recommend \\"Ixnay On The Hombre\\" and \\"Americana.\\" ...
B00000DFSK|5.0|U2 is one of the best bands of all time and this is a collection of their best work.
014028009X|4.0|the bridget jones phenomenom allowed me to feel a little happier with myself.  despite all of bridget's faults and lack thereof, Fielding has made her a heroine for normal women (aside from the aquiremnet of mr. darcy)
B00005QGAZ|5.0|This album predates me by one year, but it is still a huge favorite of mine, mixing the perfect amount of paranoia into supremely fun music before the paranoia took over.<br />Wanna Be Startin' Something: a huge starter, Michael's worried lyrics provide a perfect contrast to the booming track. A+<BR>Baby Be Mine: a fun love song, good dance number. A<BR>The Girl is Mine: cheesy duet with Paul McCartney, but still fun. A-<BR>Thriller: synonymous with Halloween because of its zombie video and freaky spoken word middle from Vincent Price. genius. A+<BR>Beat It: a guitar solo from rock god Eddie Van Halen, the perfect pop song. A+<BR>Billie Jean: paranoia again...but you can dance hardcore to it. A+<BR>Human Nature: a mellow R&amp;B song, nice chorus, enjoyable. A<BR>P.Y.T: bouncy fun song, perhaps the &quot;oldest&quot; sounding on the album. A-<BR>Lady in My Life: the best guitar riff written by a non-rock god, a shimmering love ballad, perfect closer. A+<br />So much has been said about this album, so many copies sold that I don't need to tell you to buy it. However, it is still a great album after 20 odd years and one of the best mementos from that turbulent and generally aged decade called the 80s. A must have for any self-respecting pop fan.
B00005K3O4|5.0|This is the absolute best movie of all time. Like Comedy? This has it. Like terror? this has it. Like romance? this has it. Like tragedy? well, out of luck there. This is my favorite movie of all time. I dont want to give away the story line, but it is about one night of silly scares from klowns that kan kick booty.
B000000WF0|5.0|1997 was an amazing year of music, full of epochal releases by Radiohead, Bjork, Spiritualized, and the final album from the Verve. While their earlier work was dismissed as vapid romanticisizing, \\"Urban Hymns\\" was a stone-cold classic, 13 rock-solid songs mostly written by genius-in-residence Richard Ashcroft. Even though he never reached the dizzying he attained here on his solo albums, Ashcroft created some of the best songs on the past century on this masterpiece.<br />Bitter Sweet Symphony: everything would be anti-climatic after this masterwork if they weren't all so good. a long backstory to this one, including lost royalties to the Stones' former manager, a money-grubbing devil. I hope he rots in hell. A++<BR>Sonnet: lives up to its name and the previous song with its severely pretty melody and wonderful sonics. A+<BR>Rolling People: a seven-minute blissed out jam, rocking. A<BR>The Drugs Don't Work: so gorgeous it will break your heart. A+<BR>Catching the Butterfly: the best jam song, an addictive bass line and swirling textures. A<BR>Neon Wilderness: a short textural song, disorienting but fascinating. A<BR>Space and Time: the first brilliant song on a flawless second side. lyrical genius. A+<BR>Weeping Willow: masterful use of the organ for texture. A<BR>Lucky Day: the only song that comes up to \\"BSS\\", an anthem to end all anthems. A++<BR>One Day: the lyrics are the best, another deeply textured song. A<BR>This Time: not a big favorite, someone liked it to Marvin Gaye raised on hallucinogens in Wigan. the lyrics are still great. A-<BR>Velvet Morning: a shimmering, reverb-soaked acoustic lament. more lyrical genius. A+<BR>Come On: a raucous rocker before it completely freaks out for the outro. the best album closer since \\"I Am the Resurrection\\" by the Stone Roses. A+<br />This album deserves special mention for the swirling bedrock of guitar textures it is built on, as I touched upon. It sounds a little like My Bloody Valentine might have had they pushed the bleeding guitars to the back. This was the final album the Verve recorded before disbanding, perhaps a smart idea considering they went out on the top. Please don't mistake this album (or band) as a one-hit wonder: the entire album is a marvel of wonderful songwriting, guitar work and beautiful poetic lyrics. Do yourself a favor and buy this album right now.
0679735909|5.0|This is a wonderful book.  The writing is dense and slow, but wonderfully so-- this is a book that forced me to take my time.  Byatt's weaving of history, poetry, mystery and romance creates a wonderful web of characters; the modern hero and heroine are especially well-crafted, and their relationship forms a nice counterpoint to that of the mysterious poets.  I can't say enough about this novel-- I am amazed by its richness of detail and creativity.
B000002HH2|5.0|Bjork made a huge leap forward into experimentation on her sophomore album, alienating lots of fans of her early work, but winning more for her edginess. This is considered one of the defining works of the turbulent 90s: no doubt she was one of the most compelling artists of that decade.<br />Army of Me: a huge disco beat, menacing lyrics; this is a new Bjork, and she won't take sh*t. A<BR>Hyper-ballad: the first masterpiece, a seamless dance/pop mix. haunting, beautiful lyrics. A+<BR>The Modern Things: more quirky lyrics about cars and trains waiting in mountains for their time. enjoyable. A<BR>It's Oh So Quiet: a quaint song, very much in the big band vein; it might as well have been from the 30s, slightly overplayed though. A-<BR>Enjoy: another menacing song with a big beat. she actually sounds a little scary. A<BR>You've Been Flirting Again: a sad, simple song. Bjork can sing beautifully in simple songs. A-<BR>Isobel: the album's masterpiece, I love this song to bits, sooo good. A+<br />Possibly Maybe: ambient dub, sampled by DJ Shadow on his immortal &quot;Endtroducing.....&quot;, gorgeous. A+<BR>I Miss You: a bouncy song, despite the title. good fun. A<BR>Cover Me: strange song, good lyrics though. A-<BR>Headphones: shimmering, very quiet, soothing, co-produced by Tricky; a great way to end. A<br />Next to her first album, this is possibly (maybe, ahaha) my favorite Bjork album. She seems to strike the perfect balance between the straightforward and experimental elements in her music and creates a wonderful, enjoyable album for the ages. Check it out and help a good cause.
B000002BQK|5.0|This is one of my all time favourite albums. The first Mariah Carey CD I had was the Honey single (I didn't get any more Mariah for YEARS, and then 2001 happened!) This has to be one of my favorite CDs ever. The other night when Mariah sang My All and Honey (at the August 13th Concord Charmbracelet concert), she mentioned that this is one of her favourite albums that she has done. I totally agree. It has a very smooth R&amp;B feel to it and her vocals are outstanding. Some standout songs are: Honey, My All, Butterfly, Babydoll, Breakdown, and well, actually all of them are excellent! This is highly recommended if you like smooth R&amp;B or Mariah in general. It will stay in your CD player for days on end! It did in mine! Also check out Mariah's other CDs and the Honey single. I guarantee that you'll love this album! Enjoy!!!!!
B00009W0U4|2.0|The only thing this movie gets any credit for is the fact that it didn't try to soften up the hard stuff. I thought the murder at the beginning of the movie was quite well done, once you got past the infinitely drawn-out search through the club for 'Tenia'. Unfortunately, the story overall was boring, stupid and pointless. If you've read any summary of the movie, you already know the entire story - that's really how little there is to it. Whereas there was a very important reason for Memento to run the story in reverse, there was absolutely no justification for doing it in this movie. At one point, a character states that 'our future is already written', which is the only reason I can identify for someone getting the idea that it would be okay to run the movie backwards. Pretty weak. The camera is often spinning around, giving the viewer the sense that the director was trying to be artsy yet didn't know how to do it meaningfully. Scenes drag on, and on, and on to the point of being unbearably boring. If you have a strong curiosity for ultraviolence, you might get something out of this movie. If you are hoping for an interesting or clever story, this is a total waste of time. My advice is to rent it, and fast forward to the good stuff. You'll save yourself from about an hour and twenty minutes of boredom this way.
0897240766|3.0|The transcriptions in this book are 100% dead on, they play exactly like the CD, which is great if thats what you are looking for.  However, they have one huge flaw in them.<br />Many of the songs use a capo.  The tab has the chords in both the key you are playing in, and the relative capo key, which is great.  However, the tab is written as if you do not have a capo. <br />For example,  the first chord in &quot;youve got a friend&quot; is an A, but because of the capo at the second fret, you play a G.  This would normally give you tab that had a 3 on the lowest string, to play the G note,   however, you are really on the 5th fret because of the capo.  The tab has a 5, instead of the more intuitive 3.  This makes it very difficult to play, because you have to constantly transpose the notes as you are playing.
B000035P7X|5.0|This documentary was both enlightening and entertaining.  This DVD is a must see for any Dylan fan.  Never before had I truly seen Dylan's ferocity and playfulness.  The live stuff is great as well.  The guy who made this documentary (name is escaping me) also made a Jimi Hendrix one and a Monterey one I think...hope that they are as good as this one.  This documentary is a little window into how Dylan was back in '67...around Bringing It All Back Home and Highway 61 Revisited and all...good stuff!

B000001E7V|5.0|Coming out of the critically acclaimed Massive Attack, Tricky (having dropped Kid from his name) released his debut in 1995. Strange thing is, he's nowhere to be seen for the first three track, dropping by on the fourth slo-mo song. He uses the services of singer Martina Topley-Bird to chilling effect over sexy and dark songs.<br />Overcome: highly percussive opener, sexy singing. rowr. A<BR>Ponderosa: another slow, sexy song with a strange carnival interlude. A<BR>Black Steel: the worst song, a metal cover of Public Enemy; pointless, I always skip over it. drags the album quality down. D<BR>Hell is Round the Corner: a stunning turnaround, slow-mo trip-hop based on an Isaac Hayes sample. brilliant. A+<BR>Pumpkin: shimmering production, the quality continues. A<BR>Aftermath: the longest song, just ride the groove. A-<BR>Abbaon Fat Tracks: blatantly sexual lyrics, but so sexy you'll sweat. A-<BR>Brand New You're Retro: furious tirade against hip-hop haters, blazing track. B+<BR>Suffocated Love: the best track; great melody, sexy lyrics and singing, a must-hear for any trip-hop fan. A+<BR>You Don't: ragga flavored track, not too shabby. B+<BR>Strugglin': dense song, Tricky sounds like he's struggling to breathe. but he's more normal than some. A-<BR>Feed Me: hypnotic closer, leaves you stunned. A<br />Fans of trip-hop will no doubt appreciate this dense and sexy album from an artist who has not been able to reach the heights he climbed with this album. Play it loud and float away.
B00008H2LB|5.0|This is definentley their best CD. With some of the best songs I have ever heard on it, including Faint(The best song I've heard in a while) and the rest if the cd kicks bum. I highly reccomend this cd to anyone.
B000003TA4|5.0|well, this is pretty much exactly the same as every other review ever written about this album.  Definitely Nirvana's best without a song anyone would ever skip.  the best tracks are the classic &quot;smells like teen spirit&quot;, &quot;In bloom&quot;, &quot;territorial pissings&quot;, and &quot;lounge act&quot;.  This has something for everyone.

B000051VWW|5.0|Fans of the &quot;jazz&quot; Sade of the '80s (&quot;Smooth Operator,&quot; &quot;Is It A Crime&quot; may be a bit disappointed by this CD, but I wasn't.  LOVERS ROCK proves that Sade can sing jazz-, soul- and rock-oriented (though still soft and relaxing) material with equal ease and class.  The whole of this CD is warm, relaxing and mellow.  The title song is really the only track that has echoes of the &quot;jazz&quot; Sade, and I'd have to say it's my favorite song on the album.  But every song is great!  &quot;By Your Side&quot; had minor success as a single (it reached #75 on the Hot 100 and #18 on the Adult Contemporary chart), and it exemplifies the soft, warm feel of the entire album.  &quot;King Of Sorrow&quot; and &quot;Every Word&quot; are great &quot;broken-heart&quot; songs, and if you listen to the lyrics of &quot;Immigrant&quot; and &quot;Slave Song,&quot; she's really trying to say something there.  (However, the live version of &quot;Somebody Already Broke My Heart&quot; on &quot;Lovers Live&quot; is better than the studio version, IMHO.  The live version contains an interpolation of her &quot;Promise&quot; hit, &quot;Never As Good As The First Time.&quot;) This CD won a much-deserved Grammy for Best Pop Album of 2001, but I'm glad that despite all of her success, Sade is not a &quot;diva&quot; - she's still a very down-to-earth person who is reportedly ill at ease when it comes to interviews.  While she may not have sold as many albums as Celine, Mariah or Shania, Sade is still a unique talent and a beautiful person, and that comes through on this CD.  Recommended.
6305313687|4.0|It's tough, gritty, brutal and honest.  Hatred is something people feel at least once in their lives...this film centers on how hatred has cast a shadow over a middle-class suburban family.  Ed Norton plays a reformed white power advocate who is just getting out of prison and trying to right all the wrongs he's done in his life.  Norton attemps to rescue his younger brother, who's played by Ed Furlong, from the clutches of a white power guru.  Intense and eye-opening, this film is not for those who are easily offended by racial slurs and other subjects that tackle racism in all it's true light.  Along the same lines as Romper Stomper, but not quite as overtly racist.  The DVD is somewhat weak, and only contains a few features that don't add up to much.  Big fans of the film may want to pass until another edition hits shelves, whenever that may be...but it's certainly worth a look for the curious
0151008116|5.0|I found &quot;Life of Pi&quot; to be alternatelly comic, tragic, haunting, disturbing, enlightening and depressing. While by no means a chore to read, it was draining on your emotions: it runs the gamut through all sort of feelings. When the animals on the boat start killing each other off, it's disturbing. When Pi finally catches a fish, it's inspiring. The discovery of the supposed floating utopia is hope-inducing. His grisly revelation on the floating island is scary. Richard Parker running off into the jungle without goodbye is depressing. I hope I didn't give the book away, but I think these events and the feelings they conjure perfectly illustrate the boldness of this book. Very unique, &quot;Life of Pi&quot; is a very compelling read. I'm surprised if you haven't read it already.
B00005JLSE|5.0|\\"Chicago\\" is one of the greatest musical films I have ever seen! If there is anyone who hasn't seen the movie, here is a synopsis. \\"A starry-eyed would-be star discovers just how far the notion that \\"there's no such thing as bad publicity\\" can go in this screen adaptation of the hit Broadway musical Chicago, originally directed and choreographed by Bob Fosse. In the mid-'20s, Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) is a small-time chorus dancer married to a well-meaning dunderhead named Amos (John C. Reilly). Roxie is having an affair on the side with Fred Casley (Dominic West), a smooth talker who insists he can make her a star. However, Fred strings Roxie along a bit too far for his own good, and when she realizes that his promises are empty, she becomes enraged and murders Fred in cold blood. Roxie soon finds herself behind bars alongside Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones), a sexy vaudeville star who used to perform with her sister until Velma discovered that her sister had been sleeping with her husband. Velma shot them both dead, and, after scheming prison matron \\"Mama\\" Morton hooks Velma up with hotshot lawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), Velma becomes the new Queen of the scandal sheets. Roxie is just shrewd enough to realize that her poor fortune could also bring her fame, so she convinces Amos to also hire Flynn. Soon Flynn is splashing Roxie's story -- or, more accurately, a highly melodramatic revision of Roxy's story -- all over the gutter press, and Roxy and Velma are soon battling neck-to-neck over who can win greater fame through the headlines. A project that had been moving from studio to studio since the musical opened on Broadway in 1973, Chicago also features guest appearances by Lucy Liu and Christine Baranski.\\" -Blockbuster.com
0142004235|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in quite some time.  The plot catches you up (after a slightly slow start) and doesn't let you go.  I had a difficult time putting this book down to do anything else.  If you're ready to devote a few days to reading, this is the book to choose!
B00006CXXU|5.0|Let me be straight with you.  I spent a lot of time deciding whether or not to buy this album.  Though it is getting glowing reviews on amazon.com, I do NOT listen to bubblegum pop.  All I could keep thinking about was \\"Genie in a Bottle\\".  I listen to the Beatles, the Stones, Madonna and Zeppelin.  Could I really buy a Christina Aguilera album?  But then I remembered about how Christina has completely changed her image.  And the album was getting five stars from almost everyone.  So I took the plunge and bought it.  I am so glad that I did. <BR>   Every single one of the 20 songs featured on this album is great.  Even the interludes are worth a listen.  I have always appreciated Christina's true singing talent and it really shines on this amazing album.  As I mentioned in my title, each song is either uplifting, fun, sexy or a combination of the three.  <BR>   The uplifting songs deal with such issues as women's rights, individuality, abuse, and strength.  Some of these songs are Beautiful (my favorite on the whole album), Soar, I'm OK, The Voice Within, Fighter and Can't Hold Us Down.  A listen to any of these songs will have you crying, smiling or pumping your fist in the air.<BR>   The sexy songs will have you snapping your fingers and grooving to a cool beat.  Standouts here include Infatuation, Dirrty and Get Mine, Get Yours.  These are the tracks that are sure to make you dance.<BR>   There are also a whole bunch of songs that are just plain fun, have amazing vocals or are extremely catchy.  These include the Stripped interludes, Walk Away, Make Over, Cruz, Impossible, Underappreciated, and Singin' My Own Song.  <BR>    Every single song on this album gets an A+ from me, a classic rock fan.  Pick up this album if you have any sense at all.  And not that she reads amazon.com reviews, but I give serious props to Christina Aguilera.  Not only is she an amazing singer, but she has created her own style and successfully broken away from teen pop.  \\"Stripped\\" is one of my favorite CDs, right up there with \\"The White Album\\", \\"Led Zeppelin II\\", \\"Sticky Fingers\\" and \\"Ray of Light\\".
B00005Q4CS|4.0|For those who haven't seen this film...see it now.  Rent it, own it, cherish it!  This DVD is so loaded with special features it'll take you quite some time to go through them all.  The movie itself is just gut-wrenching!!!  If this isn't the truth about the dangers of drugs, then show me the truth!!!!  The price on this DVD is low, so owning will save you money from repeated renting.  Not a film for everyone, but if you want to see a film that shakes you to the CORE I highly suggest viewing this one.
B000002HPV|5.0|If Bjork is to be remembered for anything in 30 years, hopefully it will be for her effortless way of combining the envelope-pushing with the melodic. Homogenic is her most abrasive and difficult album, but after several listens, her most rewarding.<br />Hunter: warm electronic ambience, very minimalist. A<BR>Joga: the opposite; very lush, first effortless combo of classical with electronica; on another level. A+<BR>Unravel: a call for love after the devil steals hers. strange. A<BR>Bachelorette: another lush classical/electro song, a highlight. A+<BR>All Neon Like: \\"the luminous beam feeds you\\", shimmering. A<BR>5 Years: strange music, kinda like a phone dial. A-<BR>Immature: minimalistic, good listening. A-<BR>Alarm Call: poppy, full of quotable lyrics, great melodies. A+<BR>Pluto: brutally abrasive, usually unlistenable. A- for the concept, C+ for the result.<BR>All Is Full of Love: a warm cucoon of electronic ambience, soothing vocals. great end. A+<br />Another sure-fire winner from Bjork. This was the last album before she turned inwards and mellowed out a little with \\"Vespertine\\". If you like highly challenging music, this is about as challenging as it gets before avant-garde.
0671042858|4.0|Stephen King has done it again, venturing away from the blunt supernatural, working with our inner paranoia.  Everyone's greatest childhood fear... being lost in the woods.  Then something is watching her...  I would definately reccomend this book, but do not expect the classic creepy guts-and-gore Stephen King novel, this is a whole different kind of scary tale... as eaqually wonderful and worth-while read.
B00005JMD3|3.0|Remember the days when action movies were described as \\"Die Hard on a ______\\"? Remember how any movie that was described like that never seemed to live up to the name Die Hard? S.W.A.T. is kinda like that.<br />It's not good, nor is it bad. It just kind of...is. In actuality, some parts of the film are really quite good and just scream with potential to be a part of a better movie. The real failure of this movie is the action. Again, not that the action is bad, it just isn't good. Even the climactic set piece where the characters take down the main villian never rises above even the least impressive action scenes from Die Hard. In the end, what you feel like is you just watched a pretty good TV episode.<br />The saving grace of this film is the characters. Samuel L. Jackson, L.L. Cool Jay, Michelle Rodriquez, and even Colin Farrel bring enough charisma and chemistry to the characters to keep you interested. In fact, their likable enough that you'd probably be interested in seeing a sequel regardless of what you thought of this one.<br />But in the end, S.W.A.T. is just an average action movie that doesn't do anything really wrong but neither does it ever rise up to do anything really impressive. Catch it on video.
0345347951|5.0|Arthur C. Clarke is the master on the science fiction genre, and Childhood's end is one of his greatest works. The book begins with humanity near the possiblity of nuclear destruction, and just beginning to look to the stars for their future. However, the hope for conquest of the stars is shattered when a fleet of alien ships suddenly appears over every major city on the planet. The aliens are far more technologically advanced than man, and their intellect is unmatched. Instead of having the aliens take over the planet and enslave humanity, however, Clarke has the aliens(dubbed the &quot;overlords&quot; by the citizens) request only a few things- abolish war, poverty, segregation, and cruelty to animals, and set up a global nation. With these obstacles removed, humanity enters a golden age, and earth is a utopian society; yet the Overlord's still keep their true reason for visiting earth secret.<BR>        Childhood's end is engrossing,  read it in one sitting. The ideas that Clarke puts forward are classic, the characters, such as the enigmatic Overlords, are original and captivating. With the overlords, Clarke has set up an alien race unlike any other in science fiction. Earth doesn't know the intentions of the Overlords, and neither does the reader, making the Overlords mysterious and magnificient at the same time. The Overlords are a key part on the book, and one of the reasons that make it a classic. The ideas Clarke has in the book(despite the caption in the front that reads&quot; the opinions expressed in this book are not those of the author&quot;) make you think in a different way, and put a new spin on the history and future of humanity. The ending, which I won't spoil, is both great and sad at once, very bittersweet. <BR>    Childhood's end is a classic, and the ideas that Clarke had about the future are far-reaching, and some of the aspects of his future earth can be seen in our modern culture. The only problem with the book is its slightly dated beginning, however the rest of the novel more than makes up for it. Childhood's End has influenced everything from sci-fi movies like &quot;Independence Day&quot; to computer games, and even a Pink Floyd song. I highly recommend it to any fan of the sci-fi genre, and to anyone looking for a new perspective on humanity.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Short and sweet........I love this band and I love this album.  They are not just for pre-teens like some people think.  I relate to a lot of their songs and I am 20 years old.  Awsome CD!
B00009TB5G|5.0|I saw LOTR-TTT 3 times in the movies (didn't go more cuz of the economy) and I'm drooling for the DVD to come out.  I'm gonna sit, blast my home-theater system and to h*&l with the neighbors if they don't like it...hehe.  <br />As far as the controversy surrounding the films and the books, its impossible to be 100% faithful to a story that contains so many nuances and lore behind it.  I think no one but Peter Jackson could have pulled off a half-way decent portail of the books, and his effort comes in as much more than just decent.<br />Kudos to you PJ!!!!
0804115613|5.0|I just couldn't put this book down.  Some parts were funny and some were heart-wrenching, but either way I really enjoyed it. My friend also read it and felt the same way. It is even better that the movie. It is a must read!
B000089RVX|3.0|The irony is, I've been pushing Evanscence for about 3 years now....<br />First heard them on mp3.com, and then with the album Origin. Fallen, while it was good, was a bit of a let-down to be honest. It's only real improvement is Whisper, which is a fantastic renovation of the original. Tourniquet is a good song, but holds nothing on the Soul Embraced original song (although I suppose most people don't dig the death metal-at least the guitarist from Soul Embraced is in Evanescence now..) See if you can get your hands on Origin on ebay, it's twice as good as Fallen easily.
0316666343|2.0|After having read this book, I honestly don't hold any great memories about it - just what everyone above says about it, plus to me it seems like a totally made-up story told by a 14 year old - and just that, its vocabulary is easy to read (for I am spanish)and it strikes me like the writer tries to make it somehow thrilling, but it only ends up giving you the minimum bit of energy that you need to finish the book - nothing thrilling, nothing to share, really. Plus, her life was so normal, their lives are so common there's nothing extra that makes you feel anyhhow.
B0000AOV85|5.0|This album is a must to fans of Pink Floyd.<BR>The greatest album of PF
B0000AXE8I|2.0|This movie had several problems with it and none of them were that it was difficult to understand. The plot was fairly smooth and moved the story along from where the last one left off, with a few fun twists added for good measure. My problem was with some of the less important scenes. <br />First of all, the last human city on earth, Zion, a city that is surviving hundreds of miles below the planet, supported by phenominal technology. OK, if this is true then why is everybody in it dressed like Daryl Hannah in Clan of the CAve Bear? Wow, we can support this city off the power of the core of the Earth, but Shoes? Hmmm, those are a little too difficult for us to figure out yet.<br />My next problem. Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburn) gets up in front of the multitudes to inspire them and take away the fear many are experiencing due to the impending attack on the city. The speech, given in a slowed down monotone that he must have learned from watching Brad Pitt in Meet Joe Black, was much better written and delieverd by Mel Gibson in Braveheart, This speech could have been helped by a different writer and Morpheus having a few cups of coffee before delivering it . However in spite of the lack of anything inspiring in the speech, the crowds, in their cave people outfits go wild in the cave and begin dancing and writhing in the mud upon hearing it, which brings me to my third and fourth problems with the movie.<br />Keanu Reeves and CArrie Ann Moss are a couple now, and are of course very eager for some privacy upon reaching Zion, fine, then show them making out as the door closes and we will get the idea that they are going to have sex. But the movie doesn't do that. This couple has no chemestry together, zero, zilch, Jody Foster and Harvey Firestein would have more sexual tension between them. And instead of just nixing the sex scene for being boring the movie tries to spice it up by cutting every 5 or 10 seconds to shots in slow motion of the crowd, soaking wet, covered with mud dancing in what could best be described as a very expensive Christina Aquillera video.<br />People in the audience were laughing at this scene. It was so ridiculous that it was difficult to take the rest of the movie seriously.<br />I liked the story but lets just see the plot, the special effects, and whats going to happen next, no more chorus lines of writhing cro magnum teens mixed with shots of Keanu and Carrie Ann each doing their best not to yawn themselves to death.<br />It is amazing to me that these scenes didn't hit the cutting room floor. I am willing to bet that there were MANY scenes deleated that would have been much more fun to watch.<br />See this movie so you'll know whats going on in the third one, but you probably won't want to see it twice.
B00000JLWW|2.0|So many people have often refered to this picture as the new GONE WITH THE WIND. Are you mad! This movie is pathetic, the characters are wooden and dislikeable,the actors were lousy and the extras were annoying and yet people have the nerve to say that this is to replace GONE WITH THE WIND, a superb and possibly the best movie ever and starring VIVIEN LEIGH one of the greatest actresses the world has ever seen!<BR>Kate Winslet, brilliant actress and when i saw her name i imediatly thought that this would be a blockbuster, WRONG!<BR>She was so irritating as Rose De whats it and yet the way in which she acted made her seem smarmy and showing of as though she was to be the greatest actress ever in this, and when she was constantly screetching Jack i was praying that the iceburg would come and knock her overboard and kick her of the screen as she was constantly pouting in front of it!<BR>Kathy Bates, a smashing actress with a brilliant sence of humour and whatever shes in you can expect a cracking performance, except this.As Molly Brown she was so wooden and saught of retained from giving a convincing performance.<BR>Frances Fisher was always whispering and always seemed to be angry and fussing over Winslet that i got bored of her, though she did give a good cold impression on the lifeboat!<BR>Leonardo DiCaprio was rubish as Jack and that stupid french idiot who was always either smiling or going overboard (forgive the pun)on crying who travelled with him. As Jack he was always trying to get a good close up on the camra of himself and i think his best performance when he really got into the part and looked and acted just as if he was Jack was when.......he was frozen solid in the Atlantic.<BR>All in all this is a lousy picture but if you like this saught of thing then go ahead and buy it, though don't say i didn't warn you!
068484267X|5.0|It definitely is my favorite book, together with the second part &quot;'Tis&quot; - I have been looking for a book that gets so much into me but so far I haven't found it yet - anyone could help me with that?<BR>It made me laugh, cry and feel sympathy for little Frankie. It got to the point where I wanted to find his address and write him a letter telling him about my feelings. I know Frank lives in Connecticut right now and I wish I could have a long chat with him. <BR>Just great!
0783229526|5.0|i think the reason why people didnt like this movie was because they dont understand the movie. people say it has no plot but its not like every other movie were the plot is practically in writing on the movie screen. and to all you cameron dias fans that posted complaints....ignorance thats all i have to say.<BR>Just because cameron dias was in the movie for like 2 minutes doesnt mean the movie sucks. you should have known that she wasnt a main character. and the movie is basically about a reporter and a lawyer who go on a mission if you will to find the \\"american dream\\": so johnny depp could write about his experiences... and along the way how drugs pretty much prevented him from doing so. so before you critisize actually think about what your saying other than blurting out stupidity. remember these posts are public.
0312955006|4.0|This book was pretty interesting because not only did it involve the police and Harry's struggle with them- but it involved a court drama. And his past. <br />It's always fun when you know a character to go back and learn a little more about them and I felt this novel did a pretty good job of that. (I know the next one moves further into that category...) I also loved that it continues on from the book before it and his relationship with Sylvia. It's cool to see things progress, as if you're catching up with a friend.<br />What I enjoyed the most was how Connelly switched things up a little and added the courtroom drama. A bit of the break of the monotomy that can get to be a part of certain police crime books. And it was about a serial killer, which created a lot of suspense. I continue to be having fun while reading the Bosch series from Connelly.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|Do not listen to anyone giving this movie a bad review. They are wrong and always will be. This movie was awesome! A must see!
B00008H2LB|3.0|Meteora is not on par with Hybrid Theory. This is mainly due to the fact that Meteora is a tornado of high production. This means plastic music... but then again, teeny boppers won't care. As for casual listeners, this album will still provide 30 minutes of solid entertainment; just make sure you don't take any of this stuff seriously, unless your in the 5th grade. I would say that Linkin Park needs to grow up, but what does it matter? If they can keep pumpimg out fairly entertaining albums, then I could care less about the pre-school lyrics. Teeny boppers, this disc is for you. Casual listeners, get on Kazaa. Thumbs up.
0676973779|5.0|This book is a spellbinding masterpiece. Catch-words like inspirational and spiritual - the Oprah-speak that the people who discuss this book will inevitably toss around - cannot even begin to describe the experience that comes from reading The Life of Pi. I don't care what god (or God if you're fond of capital letters) you believe in, consider this book a part of your required reading list.<br />If you don't believe in God...don't let that keep you from reading this book. If nothing else, you will come away with a firm belief in the power of literature and in the author's ability to craft a sublimely haunting yarn that demands both a second reading, and a good week's worth of sober introspection. Another book that I seriously recommend is \\"HE NEVER CALLED AGAIN.\\"
B000001FT2|5.0|I never expected that one day I will find something magnificent that was created in a decade that was a big mess in my opinion ...(especially in the music business)...The 80'S.  I mean Rock'n Roll records (especially the heavy metal and hard types)..were occupying most of the shelves in each megastore and every were you go ...or .you'd find people who are obsessed with the NEW WAVE electronic style..and if not,then as the majority...(POP)!!!    So it was a very un-classified decade with the same kind of style...and with some of the most terrible fashion scenes...ever.    But some of the artists were clever enough to make out of themselves some icons in the history of music(not because their music was beautiful and famous,but of avoiding anything that might give their music some attention that won't make it lasts for a long time...(such as what was done by The Human League,Prince,Bananarama and others...).  In tehe opposite..we have Grace Jones,who is considered as one of the great artist .She was stylish in her music and her looks without breaking the limits..That was all what made her music a classic.    I proudly can say that she's one of the few artists who managed to have a combination in their music (which made it dificullt to define in genre but gave it a new effect that satisfied different tastes).    Nowadays,her music is rarely been followed (although it's still playing in different clubs all over France,Germany and other parts of Europe and also classified in one way as Reggie).    Some of the tracks in this album which I think is the best by her-next to \\"Private life\\" & \\"La Vie De Rose\\"- are remixed and re-released.    Her (Libertango) track was one of the gems that was a big hit in the eighties and my favourite of all time.  The idea of singing French and English in one song with her moaning that gives a strange funny feeling that is more like (feeling sorry for someone or yourself).It just reminds me of Bolonian energetic night-girls in Paris...standingand sitting in low class nighclubs waiting for a hunk or the ugly man who knows how to pay!!  Her music is just so wonderful to stick with..it influences you with silly portraits and imaginations that sometimes makes you laugh..  Just try to listen to a track by her and imagine an act or something..you will love it more..and more..and more...  Her music is way too easy to listen and the instruments are simple with the precise amount of electronica.    Fans of nowadays who find (Ladytron/Goldfrapp/Client/Angie Reed/Gus Gus/Playgroup/Death in Vegas/The Faint)powerful,get down and discover the source of power.
B000002ADT|1.0|The reason for this album's eternal appeal lies in its emotional tone.Once its quietism was the perfect reflection of the spiritual Emptiness of the Eisenhower era.Now its boredom,nostalgia and scarcely concealed contempt make it the perfect background music for this narcissistic age of ours.
0790730960|5.0|This is by far the best of the Batman movies in the series. <br />Batman's main villain is the horrible Penguin whose malacious goals is to kill Gothan City's first-born children.<br />This is better than the first one and sadly the last good one in the series. \\"Forever\\" was okay but a major step down and \\"Batman and Robin\\" was pure manure. <br />Go and buy this movie and the first one. Avoid the latter two. Eom!

B00005JLKB|5.0|Smallville is one of those gems that most people didn't expect to even go much beyond its pilot episode.  However, when viewers and critics alike actually began to watch the show, it knocked everyone's socks off!<br />What Smallville does is put a new and refreshing spin on the Superman story. Most people know his story as a baby and how the Kents adopted him.  And we're all familiar with him wearing the red cape and changing in telephone booths.<br />What happened in between?  The teenage years for any normal person can be filled with drama and challenges.  But imagine being the most powerful being on earth, with new and emerging powers to discover (Clark still can't really fly yet).  We know he will eventually use his powers for good, but how tough of a road is it for our young hero?<br />This dramatic irony is what makes this show absolutely fantastic.  We know Clark becomes Superman, we know he ends up with Lois Lane and NOT Lana, and we know Clark and Lex Luther will eventually become arch enemies.  We know Clark's destination, but we're now getting a good look at his trip.<br />Every season, Clark takes another huge step towards realizing his destiny.  Supposedly, a young Bruce Wayne (Batman) will make an appearance soon, along with Lois Lane, Perry White (Clark's future boss at the Daily Planet), and Jimmy Olsen (the young photographer at the Planet).  So things are beginning to come full circle.<br />You don't need to be a comic book fan, nor knowledgable of anything Superman to enjoy this great series.
6301797906|2.0|Steinbeck's book is a superb piece of literature.  It presents characters who are full of life and a story that needed to be told.  The movie falls short on every front.  Scene after scene is ignored or changed beyond recognition.  The movie is an embarrassment to the book.   Suggest you read the book and skip the movie.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I do not think that these two girls are lesbians or act it just because it makes them popular. I think they are really in love (you can tell in the way they act with each other). I also think that their music is brilliant! I have heard so much &quot;kiddie&quot; music, but this really gives me goosebumps! And mainly the remixes, it is loud and in your face! The way music should be!
038572179X|5.0|Despite the mixed reviews on amazon.com, I really enjoyed Atonement by Ian McEwan. I think that the mixed reviews are due to the different expectations people have when they decide to read a novel. Some people expect to be entertained and carried along by a story from start to finish. Others readers like a book that unfolds for them and are willing to \\"work\\" a little bit for the opportunity to experience something unique. I believe that people with the former expectations do not and will not enjoy Atonement. However, if you fall into the latter category, you will appreciate this book.<br />    McEwan's main character Briony is a writer (albeit a young one at the start of the novel). The sub-plot of the novel addresses the god-like powers, for better or for worse, a writer has over reality. Any writer (professional or dabbler) will empathize with Briony as she discovers the pleasures and wrestles with the consequences of twisting reality.<br />   I refuse to discuss the main storyline (although other reviewers have if you are really curious) because it is better to go into the book \\"blind\\". However, you should know that based on plot alone, Atonement would be considered average. The praise that has been heaped upon this book is due to the way McEwan tells the story and the resulting sub-plot. Thus, to appreciate this novel one must be prepared do some independent thinking and not expect to be spoon fed. Definitely a thinking person's novel, but well worth the \\"work\\".
1884737994|2.0|I admit it. I am a clutz when it comes to mechanical things. Because of this lack of talent, I need lots of photos and illustrations for me to get through any sort of repair work. Zinn has a book that will appeal to those who are mechanically adept, but as for the novice or individuals like me who lack spacial relations, the book will be very confusing. Much of the book describes, in words, what you should do instead of showing you in a step by step way with photos. &quot;Take the gibetz ring off of the whatchamacallit and be careful not to put tension on the g-string...&quot; This sentence wasn't in the book, but it might as well have been. I found this book to be very hard to understand.
B00009W0WM|2.0|I already own a perfectly good dvd of Casablanca, but I<BR>I bought this two disc set to get the Premier episode from the 1955 Casablanca TV series &quot;who holds tomrrow&quot;. <BR>The show was complete up to the about 9 mins then it jumped to the end of the episode with and a commercial for a total of 17:50 of footage.  I was really getting into this show and felt cheated and used when the complete episode was not shown.

B000001IPP|5.0|Rancid are my favourite band and this CD is their best with ...And Out Come The Wolves. It kicks ...! I can always listen to this no matter what. Best songs I never skip are Radio, Salvation, Ballad of Jimmy and Johnny, Let's Go, I am the one, St.Mary and 7 years down. But really they are all awsome. Great punk CD and the best Rancid. If your into punk music get this.
B000065U1N|1.0|As far as I can tell, this \\"elite\\" group of 18 year olds who'd \\"never shot anyone\\" were ordered by the commanding officer on the scene (who later took responsibility for the botched operation) to raid a fortified enemy position to take prisoners. The \\"plot twist\\" is that they don't get out? I mean, we didn't see that coming from 178947 miles away? Like when they pulled the typist off the desk and gave him a gun? This film, and the circumstances, go from bad to worse, to just absurd, in like .000034 seconds.<br />If this film didn't convince more people that the military are just out there doing who-the-hell-knows-what, I'm pretty sure military-loving must be genetic. There's certainly heroism in abundance, the cynic in me wonders how much of that is revisionist history, but backtracking about half a step we see that the military thumbed it's nose at the UN when it first undertook the operation to capture/assassinate the militant warlord \\"Aidid.\\" Then, having made that grave misstep, demanded UN assistance to get their soldiers out. My question is, in the final scenes as the military have effectively abandoned 20-30 of their own to run behind the exiting tanks, why is it so very easy to run to \\"safe\\" territory? If it is so very simple and can be done with so little problem - why exactly didn't the civilian Somalians who wanted out from under the thumb of the dictator do so - just like these wounded exhausted military folks who in the closing scenes just limped out of this warzone? Assuming that's just a misrepresentation of the ease-of-escape from disputed territory to \\"safe\\" UN territory, the fact remains that the film leaves a lot to be desired. Mostly, a point.<br />This film came highly recommended. I have some creative punishments to tailor.
B0000A4GAK|4.0|This is a great CD.  Although Derek Trucks plays with the Allman  Brother's Band, this is not an Allman Brothers sounding CD with the Exception of &quot;Drowning in my own tears&quot; with Greg Allman.  If you like Jazz, International, or Blues you should like this album.  There are some tracks that really groove.  And there are also some tracks that really dive in to an international sound.  Kofi Burbridge on the flute and the organ can make some sounds that leave you stunned.  All in all, this is a pretty mellow CD.  But one can listen from start to end and not get bored.
B00007KQA3|2.0|I was considering buying the DVD of this great film until I read some of the reviews. It's insane that the folks who produced it decided to remove a memorably surreal soundtrack for apparently no good reason. Considering it's a DVD (and not VHS), they could have at least been considerate enough to give people the option of choosing between the &quot;Original Soundtrack&quot; and &quot;Orchestral Soundtrack.&quot;<br />I'm going to hold off buying this for now, and hope that MGM will correct this error.

B00003CXWV|2.0|This is a story of a \\"good boy\\" turned into a big drug dealer, including all the usual elements- the way up, the pretty wife, the cars, the riches, the betrayal of a good friend and then all the way down. Sounds familiar? Yes, you have seen it in \\"Scar face\\" and other movies of the same kind, only there the story was more interesting; Cruel maybe, but with some reasoning - you could understand the motives behind the actions of the heroes (be it to advance, to prove their power, to control) and you got immersed in the logic of the drug world.  This movie on the other hand is neither convincing in its logic or characters nor presented in an interesting manner. Contrary to what we expect the movie is also non violent and this fact (which in other cases could have been appreciated by me) makes it not credible, or rather covering up the truth more then disclosing as we know the events have truly happened. <BR>George, the `good boy\\", played by Johnny Depp is presented as some kind of tragic hero. Someone who got involved in \\"bad things\\" but really just wanted to live in peace and quiet with his family...The only explanation we get for his turn to crime was that his mom always used to nag his dad for money...Everything his dad earned was not enough. George then promised himself that he will always have money.<BR>George gets into the drug business as if by mistake, just to earn some quick money for him and his friends (\\"these were great days\\"...he says with nostalgia). He was the mind behind the group of good kids and devises techniques of drug delivery while using his girlfriend Barbara as a carrier. The drugs are sold to other \\"good kids\\" from universities and colleges and the techniques of drug delivery grows more sophisticated as there is rise in demand. We never get to see the \\"end customers\\" or the final sale process which I assume could have been interesting to watch. Barbara dies from cancer (\\"I really loved her\\") and George starts making big money by joining with the Boss, the famous Escobar, a symbol of the drug world and its corruption. However, not in this movie... The drug world presented here is clean of violence. The Colombian farmers are nave and nice and even the scene with Escobar is quite mellow, besides maybe one shot.  In George's jail periods we learn about the qualities of cocaine (good cocaine melts only in 86 degrees) but these facts seem to be the only gain from this movie.<BR>I have just seen Johnny Depp as a charming Pirate in the new film \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" where he just shines through - here however, except for his beauty there are no signs of the famous Depp magic. Here his beauty is not enough to save his role from total shallowness. His gestures and facial expressions are void of any true feelings. <BR>Penelope Cruz who plays the beautiful wife is one of my favorite actresses. However, I have to admit that even she does a lousy job here. Maybe it's not her fault as her role is of the spoiled rich wife who does nothing but be pretty and smoke drugs - however, her part is a pale replica of the part Michelle Pfeiffer does in scar face and she does not manage to look convincing, nor is it clear what besides her looks, drew George to her. Penelope Cruz hardly appears in the movie and I did not appreciate the fact that her picture is the one appearing on the cover of this movie. Ray Liota and Rachel Griffiths play George's parents, and although Ray Liota is convincing as the father, the mother seems the same age as her son and she does not seem to bring anything to this role.    <BR>I must confess that in several parts this movie seems like an \\"ordered movie\\" to clean the name of George Jung or at least present him in a human light as the movie is so one sided and unconvincing. In the end we see George in prison, waiting and hoping that his daughter would come to visit... the movie is filled with manipulations such as this one who are meant to make you feel sorry for this man.

B000000I0I|5.0|Although not as well known as Tubular Bells, Ommadawn is definitely one of the best pieces of instrumental music in recent years. After listening to it a couple of weeks ago the music keeps playing in my head. The music sounds very pure and has a feeling of innocence and beauty. The last part the Horseback song is childlike but also is consistent with the purity of the music in the rest of the album. This remains along with Tubular Bells his best music.

B00004Y6Q5|4.0|I give it a generous 4 stars because yes, I DO like this music very much. However, they left out arguably the MOST IMPORTANT piece...the &quot;warm up&quot; of Kronos Quartet that can be heard in the beginning of the movie when Harry goes home to take his mom's television. They later play that when Ty meets Brody.<br />It's totally integral to the movie. Without it, the CD is not a true reflection of what the movie represents. At least, that's the way I see it.<br />In addition, I think the music in the film is more enjoyable than simply hearing it on CD without the visuals.<br />However, this CD does not contain any more music than you hear in the film. This is not the CD to Gattaca, where there are full orchestrations. Requiem for a Dream CD contains &quot;snippets&quot; as short as those you hear in the film.<br />Enjoyable, although a bit lacking unfortunately.
B00007G1ZC|5.0|Cinematography like no other.  Beautiful stuff.  Like a live action haiku.  I fully recommend it.  No words... Dark and melencholy at times, sweet and lighthearted at others.  I love this movie, and I hope you can have a chance to see it once.  A triumph of a great director who has influenced some of the most well-known directors of our times.
0060934913|4.0|I'm not in the restaurant business, but am one of those folks who has friends constantly telling me I should open a restaurant.  So, it was with great excitement that I opened up Kitchen Confidential.  This is a great summer read.  The chapters are like short independent stories, making it easy to read a chapter or so an evening.  However, by mid-way through the book I couldn't put the darn thing down!  While Bourdain does a nice job of explaining the craziness of the industry, the characters you meet wandering in and out of Bourdain's path are truly affecting.  I found myself totally taken with Steven the sous-chef and Scott Bryan.  I particularly enjoyed reading about Bourdain's international motley crew of a kitchen staff.  I don't think I'll ever think of a Mexican prep cook the same way again.<br />I would have given this book 5 stars, but it didn't make me laugh, cry and experience everything from birth to death.  This may be because I've never really been in the business.  However, if you like Bourdain's dry, sarchastic wit (and I do), then you will definitely find yourself smirking and snorting fairly regularly as you read.  It's definitely a must-read for anyone who's interested in what goes on behind those two-way swinging doors in the corner.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Donnie Darko is a wonderful movie. It really can't be placed in one single category, because that would be denying other aspects of the film. There is the psychological aspect (Donnie, a schizophrenic, sees a man in a giant rabbit costume named Frank who tells him to do things), and there's a family aspect (older sister fights with father about voting issues, younger sister is in a dance group, mother is constantly showing worry for Donnie). There's also a kind of relationship aspect with Donnie and the new girl at school, Gretchen, but its extent is lesser than the ones I've already mentioned (if you wanted a sappy romance, go get a Jennifer Lopez flick).<br />I'd really recommend the DVD version, because it has the Mad World music video (I cried the first time I heard it), it has deleted scenes, and if you can stand the ubertiny print, the Philosophy of Time Travel in the movie is available to read on the DVD; it helped me understand the whole jet engine thing.<br />Overall, it is a grand movie; don't pay attention to the bad reviews, because they either didn't understand it or didn't get the message concerning isolation from the rest of society. Or maybe I got it because I myself am thirteen and having a prolonged anti-social thing. Either way, it's a great movie that some people might just not get if they don't give it a chance.
B00007H1Y2|1.0|Let me start by saying that I don't get Latin music. So perhaps I am biased. On the other hand, I know Ry Cooder's talent. Where did it go? This is ... what? I want to say boring but it isn't that. It was annoying. It was trivial and trite and the guitar licks were non existent. I am not much of a musician myself but I have created more interesting music while playing with the pre-recorded rhythms on an electronic keyboard at the music store while my daughter was having a lesson. But then I'm also the guy who slept through the B.B. King/Eric Clapton collaborative album. I can't in conscience recommend this CD. I plan to burn my copy.

B00004VWAF|5.0|As a long time listener of Miles Davis' varied musical endeavors, I always figured that there was nothing left in his catalog that could truly throw a faithful listener for a loop. But if you're familiar with his other albums and haven't heard \\"On the Corner,\\" do yourself a favor and GET IT NOW. Even by today's standards, when technology has seemingly squeezed every the life and surprise out of every available sonic possiblity, this album just comes screaming from the speakers and kicks you ... like nothing before or after it. The drummers and percussionists leave dizzy, and the solos are like nothing you've ever heard. Any 'groundreaking' genre that proceeds it, be it house, electronica, hip hop, jungle, drum n bass, etc., suddenly sounds very old and contrived. This album is the bar which the most computer savvy producers today are either conciously or unconsciously trying to pass.
B00003CWL6|5.0|Sam Mendes' masterpiece \\"American Beauty\\" has it all--it begins as a hilarious comedy, and ends as a dark drama.<br />The film opens with Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) telling us that in less than a year, he will be dead, striking suspense throughout the film as to how he might die. Lester, who works for a magazine company, introduces us to his chipper realtor wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) tending to her roses as if they matter more than life itself. Their high school daughter, Jane (Thora Birch) appears as a typical teenager...\\"angry, confused.\\" We look at this family and our first impression is that they are ordinary and perfectly happy...but if we \\"look closely,\\" we can see that this is not the case. Lester is cowardly, unhappy, and looking for a change. Carolyn is phony, controlling, and materialistic. And Jane feels lost in the dysfunction of the family. But soon, change blossoms in each of their lives. Lester soon falls for Jane's seductive friend, Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari), who appears as the school sl*t, and is driven to toying with men and becoming a model in the process. But \\"look closer\\"...this is not the case. Jane becomes alienated because of Lester's lust after her best friend. Carolyn doesn't seem to notice, too busy impressing and exerting perfection. At the same time, the new neighbors move in next door...the Fitts. Colonel Frank Fitts (Chris Cooper) appears as a homophobic, violent, and controlling father. His wife Barbara (Allison Janney) tends to her husband and is completely passive. Their son Ricky (Wes Bentley) is seen to be a peeping Tom, and films beauty, which to him, can be found in everything. But look closer...these people are not what they seem. The Colonel has a darker secret, his wife is catatonic, and Ricky deals drugs, hiding it from his strict father with catering jobs. Each character seems separate, desperate in a way, but, they all come together in the end. Lester quits his job for the better, getting a job flipping burgers at \\"Mr. Smiley's\\". Carolyn refuses to be a victim of her family, takes on an affair with realtor rival Buddy \\"The King\\" (Peter Gallagher), and buys a gun. Jane slowly starts to realize that Angela is not what she seems while identifying with Ricky and falling in love. And the Colonel can no longer hold his secret in. These unraveling lives lead to a conclusion that leaves us looking closely.<br />The visuals of the film are extraordinary...from the rose petals to Conrad L. Hall's gorgeous and insightful cinematography. Thomas Newman's score is one of the best I have heard in a long time--the inventive sounds of the drums, and the compelling beauty of the piano pieces.<br />The performances are just as wonderful. I don't intend to be blunt, but there aren't any likeable characters in this film. The exception is that Kevin Spacey plays Lester so brilliantly, and by the end, we do not want his inevitable death to come. The young performances are all fantastic as well, getting us into the mindset of these very unusual teenagers. Chris Cooper gets under your skin as the Colonel. Annette Bening, though, gives the best performance of the film. We do not like Carolyn, and that is the beauty of her performance. If an actress can play a part so well that we hate her, she has done her job. By the end of \\"American Beauty\\", we realize, beneath her artificiality and determination for material success, how much she really does love Lester. Oscar should have gone to Annette in 2000, and Chris Cooper. The entire ensemble cast is brilliant.<br />This is by far the most fantastic and beautiful film I have ever seen. Its two central themes entertain two true ideas. You cannot condemn what you first see, and that you have to look closely, because what you first see isn't the whole picture. And that beauty can be found in the most unexpected places in life. In a word, \\"American Beauty\\" is perfect. See it and look closer!
0671027344|4.0|The book, although I was quite shaken by the \\"twist\\" ending, was still quite right.  The feelings of our precocious narrator are very true to life.  It does capture high school well.   This one shines at times because of it's format and honesty.  It will leave you feeling both happy and sad at the same time, which Charlie talks about at one point.  <br />I was reminded of two other novels, of the coming of age genre, which fans of this book might like.  There is 10th Grade which was released last year and is lighter hearted than this.  However, it does a fine job of capturing the lonely days of school...and on a more esoteric note, \\"Everything Looks Impressive\\" by Hugh Kennedy...which takes place with a freshman in college and a senior he befriends...<br />All worth the read.
B00005J79J|5.0|If anyone asks \\"Who Is Sarah Brightman?\\", and what a stupid person it would be asking this question in 2003, tell them to buy this wonderful compilation featuring many of Ms. Brightman's outstanding performances of the past decade.  Ms. Brightman has developed over the past few years as one of the finest female recording artists and, along with Mylene Farmer and Madonna, a woman who completely understands the recording studio and the various ways it can enhance a voice and talent, unlike the array of garbage producing records today, such as J-LO, Brittny, Christina, and all those other, cloned-interchangeable-generic-no-talent-hip-hop-babes.<br />This compilation wets one's appitite for the complete feasts that awaits with the albums DIVE, FLY, TIMELESS, EDEN, LA LUNA, and, most successful of all, HAREM.  Pay particualr attention to the title track from EDEN, a most perfect example of chilled-out-trip-hop.  Enjoy!
B00008GKEG|5.0|I got this for my husband's birthday.  We spent the better part of a weekend watching it from beginning to end.  It was gripping.  It will make your life pass before your eyes (if you're over 35).
B00008H2LB|5.0|Like many people, I anticipated this album for months before it was finally released on the last Tuesday of March, 2003. Thankfully, Linkin Park hasn't changed their style a bit. They don't sacrifice their heavy metal edge for money and popularity, but that's probably because they already have tons of both. \\"Meteora\\" is often considered to be just a continuation of \\"Hybrid Theory,\\" which, in essence, it is. But since when is that a bad thing? The album's twelve songs blend together nicely, with the exception of track 11, \\"Nobody's Listening,\\" a disappointing hip-hop act with, for some reason, Shakuhuchi flutes in the verses.<br />Fans should be pleased to hear that the album's singles (three so far: \\"Somewhere I Belong,\\" \\"Faint,\\" and \\"Numb\\") are not necessarily the best songs on the album. In other words, those who go out and buy the disc will not have already heard all the good stuff. Aside from the thirteen-second opener (\\"Foreword\\"), there is no filler.<br />Every track on the album has something memorable to offer. \\"Hit the Floor\\" has a simple but catchy guitar hook, backed up by Mike Shinoda's speedy rhymes. \\"Easier to Run\\" is one of those nu-metal power ballads -- don't worry, it's not about love or anything -- featuring soft verses and classic screaming choruses. It's very similar to \\"Crawling,\\" although not as loud.<br />Anybody -- ANYBODY -- who liked \\"Hybrid Theory\\" should fall in love with \\"Meteora.\\" It may be a minute shorter, and it may come in a funky cardboard case, but at the very least, it blows \\"Reanimation\\" out of the water.
B00006879E|1.0|First of all, I work at Hollister in the mall and this CD frequently makes the rotation on our jukebox where customers get to pick songs to play.  I cannot tell you how much my fellow employees and myself hate this CD.  It's actually aggravating to listen to.  We still have no clue why they are as popular as they are.  To start off with, the singer's voice is so annoying that when I hear it, I get an uncontrollable urge to throw furniture and other things at customers.  As if that wasn't bad enough, the lyrics to the songs are just []repetitive.  I think just about every song on the album is about some dumb girl that the lead singer is obsessed with.[]  If you want to hear some good alternatives to this musical atrocity try Trapt, Linkin Park, Coldplay, or Seether.
B00005JL7Q|5.0|What a splendid and enjoyable movie!  Hugh Grant did not stray  far from his bumbly self-absorbed character that he so often plays, but it was completely perfect in this movie.<br />Will is a slacker who lives off of the royalties of a Christmas carol that his father wrote in 1958, he does not work, sits at home all day and watches game shows and \\"Xena, Warrior Princess\\".  He devises a plan to meet women by going to SPAT meetings (Single Parents Alone Together) and pretending he has a 2 year old son.  He does get a date, and seredipitously meets Marcus, an awkward teen whose mother is severely depressed, and has attempted suicide.<br />Will and Marcus' exchanges are very touching, because you realize that they need each other.  Will's irresponsible selfishness begins to melt away, and Marcus makes a friend.<br />I loved the \\"Killing Me Softly\\" duet, it was great!  Both actors were great in this movie--perfect team.
0345457684|5.0|Morgan writes one of the most stunning new SF books in some time, bringing us a noir thriller in an exotic yet frighteningly familiar future. The tone is firmly set not in the halls of Science Fiction, but in the legacy of 1930's hard-boiled crime fiction, full of plots, counterplots, seamy locales, seamier people, and above all, sex, violence, and death.<br /><br />This is a world where no one dies for good, where bodies are cloned and personalities held in cortical \\"stacks\\" sleeved into them. A rich man \\"died\\" by apparent suicide, and when revived calls in a renowned offworld criminal to investigate. What Takeshi Kovacs finds are unhelpful cops, people and gangs out to hurt or kill him, bewildering events, lies everywhere, and dead bodies showing up around every corner. Every ally is a potential enemy, with the exception of the hotel he stays in.<br /><br />After being chased, shot at, beaten, burned, tortured, and nearly killed many times, he slowly realizes that behind it all is another of the ancient power players of the world, one with whom he has an old history. Only then Kovacs tries to get the upper hand, methodically manipulating events to a final showdown.<br /><br />The perspective is gritty, hardened, and not a little bitter. Kovacs is an antihero more than willing to take whatever measures he feels are necessary, including killing - permanently. He is a seasoned Envoy, a long-time criminal (though just how is hazy), and has been through many bodies and many worlds. No one is particularly likable, but many are somehow sympathetic. The combination of hard crime thriller with many unique SF elements - Science Fiction, and San Fransisco - works well. The author has done a great job here.<br /><br />There are deeper ideas floating around. What is death? What would revival mean for religion, for law enforcement, and for life in general? How would the elite change? Every member of the upper-class is distasteful or downright evil, seeing people as pawns and playtoys; to the author they have no redeeming social value. The epilogue is a little trite, but that's made up for by all the psychadelic dream sequences, Kovacs' dead buddy Jimmy De Soto giving him advice from time to time.<br /><br />An engrossing book, with a very satisfying ending leaving more than enough room for sequels. If you don't mind seeing the very worst of humanity, and rather gratuitous sex at times, I highly recommend.aytoys; to the author they have no redeeming social value.

B00005JKDR|5.0|A little green ball with one eye, and a large purple spotted furball--with the voices of Billy Crystal and John Goodman--already a great premise to the movie!  The storyline was so creative, a whole city \\"Monstropolis\\" powered by the screams of frightened children, yet it was the monsters who were deathly afraid of the little ones... \\"one touch will kill you!\\" is the mantra of the monsters-in-training.<br />Obviously the animation will attract the children, but do not ignore this one adults!  There are some great laughs for you that none of the children will understand...  too many instances to recount here.<br />A very fun movie to watch--Pixar and Disney team-ups have added another great one to the list!

B000002J0P|4.0|In 1969, David Crosby was still recovering from being fired by the Byrds; Stephen Stills was still recovering from the disintegration of Buffalo Springfield; and Graham Nash was, I gather, looking for a job after his stint with the Hollies.  They found each other and &quot;magic&quot; occured, each of them has related.  Well... in my opinion, most of the trends that followed the success of this first CSN album are dismal ones, and you can see the seeds of those trends right here on this disk.  But that doesn't mean it's a bad album; in fact, it's almost a great album.<br />To me, the key to this album is Crosby.  As he would be the first to tell you, he was one of the most skilled musicians ever to work in rock.  As a vocal harmonist, not only was he gifted vocally, but he understood harmony in ways few outside of Brian Wilson understood it.  His vocal contributions to the Byrds' great hits, beginning with &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; all the way til his uncredited work on &quot;The Notorious Byrd Brothers&quot; makes their mediocre songs interesting, and their great songs enduring classics.  What makes Crosby so interesting is that he draws his harmonic understandings from at least three different sources--above all folk music, but also classical and jazz; and blends them seamlessly.  Another intersting thing about Crosby is how he worked some of his greatest magic on songs other than his own.  That was true with the Byrds, and it's true here.  The best song by far on CSN is Crosby's &quot;Guinnevere,&quot; a rich harmonic treat.  Crosby's other two songs, &quot;Long Time Gone&quot; and &quot;Wooden Ships&quot; aren't so focused on the harmonies as they are on Crosby's solo vocals.  But he adds a lot of texture to Stills' work, especially the Greenwich Village sound of &quot;You Don't Have To Cry&quot; and the lovely &quot;Helplessly Hoping.&quot;<br />Stills does a good job on this album, too.  His songwriting is sharp throughout, especially on the aforementioned tunes, plus of course the group's signature song, &quot;Suite: Judy Blue Eyes.&quot;  Nash contributes to the vocal mix--it's pretty clear that Crosby thought Nash's high voice combined with his own would create a big sound, and it works out just that way.  But, unfortunately, band democracy (one of those bad trends CSN started) required that Nash also be given a chance to contribute his own songs, and all of them are terrible.  &quot;Marrakesh Express&quot; is just silly, and &quot;Pre-Road Downs&quot; is unlistenable.  &quot;Lady of the Island&quot; has a nice vocal round, so it's the best of his contributions, but CSN would have been a better group if it had limited Graham to singing only.<br />This album is about as good as it gets for CSN/CSNY.  I like their live album, and about half of Deja Vu is solid, especially Crosby's title track.  After that...you gotta figure it was the drugs.  But Crosby's still alive, and so the dream of something great arising from his incredible musical gifts is far from ended.oned tunes, plus of course the group's signature song, &quot;Suite: Judy Blue Eyes.&quot;  Nash contributes to the vocal mix--it's pretty clear that Crosby thought Nash's high voice combined with his own would create a big sound, and it works out just that way.

0767817486|5.0|This is a brilliant story based on actual events that occurred in Turkey. The scary thing is that these events happen every single day. Brutal torture and barbaric brutalization of people in Turkey is a fact of life and this film does a fantastic job in dramatizing them.<br />Amnesty International has well-documented cases of such violent acts committed against people that the govt. deems \\"guilty\\" of even the most minor offenses. Women are subject to rape and forcible vaginal examination at the hands of deranged policemen and young men are sodomized as punishment for their \\"alleged\\" crimes.<br />Ignore the claims of racism made by pro-Turkish pundits that this film supposedly displays. This film is NOT racist. If the truth is racist, then let the truth be shown in its' most brutal detail. What we see in the film are real, actual events that happen to both Turks and non-Turks in Turkey, every single day. While it's true that Billy Hayes did not experience every single act of torture in this film, Oliver Stone and Alan Parker simply culled through the records of Amnesty International and gave voice to the countless victims of a brutal regime that has yet to this day to change its' human rights record.<br />This is a film that should be bought and watched periodically to remind ourselves of the kinds of depraved govts. that exist around the world and how they abuse human rights aimed at not only their own people but to Americans as well.<br />The only things I wish were covered in the film was the real escape by Hayes and how he was helped by Greece and sent back to the U.S. The Greeks could very easily have sent Hayes back across the border to Turkey but in recognition of the cruel beating and rape that awaited him back in Turkey, the Greeks did the right thing and sent him home. Also, what happened to his friend \\"Max\\", we are never told.
B00005ATQ9|5.0|Maximum Kubrick moments abound as this 18th century painting comes to life. Title character is 18th century Irish rogue eventually finding his way into aristocratic English society. He is a stranger in a strange land(at one point dons Prussian Army officers uniform that leads to one of my favorite scenes with Hardy Kruger), and once Lyndon finds himself in new setting he must figure out what is the &quot;right&quot; behaviour. The story is actually a tragedy. All glory is fleeting applies here.   <BR>     DVD transfer is as beautiful as the costumes, camerawork, music, and lighting(famous indoor candle-lit scenes are amazing).<BR>Stanley Kubrick wanted originally to make a period film about Napoleon, but when &quot;Waterloo&quot; failed at the box office he abandoned it. Lyndon, I guess, became his period piece gem. He would not make another film until 5 years later with 1980's The Shining.
0590542443|5.0|Philip Pullman's last installment of his Dark Materials masterpiece stands high above the previous two books.Pullman builds this phenomanal world through his books which fully captivates the reader. Pullman artfully ties up the loose ends from his previous books creating suspense which builds to a massive climax near the end of the book. The best thing about the Dark materials trilogy is the different levels at which you can read it. You must remember that the book was aimed originaly at children and you can definitely see the appeal it has to children through Lyra and Will's adventure, one which many kids will envy. To escape to another world! Do not pay attention to stuffy reviews about the blasphemy and anti Catholic theme of Pullman's writing. Although he displays many theological and metaphysical ideas in his world,some of which are anti-<BR>Church,they do not actually affect the story in any way. The fact is if you put those ideals to the side you still have a great book!<br />The only fault of the books is that it ends!
0393057658|5.0|To every rule, there is always the exception. Take the world of major league baseball. With free agency driving player salaries to unbelievable heights, it's an accepted piece of conventional wisdom that only rich teams can be successful today.<br />If that's really true, then why have the Oakland A's, with one of the lowest payrolls in the game, been one of sport's most consistent winners these past few years? That's the question that Michael Lewis answers in this fascinating book. At the heart of the story is the general manager of the A's, Billy Beane. Beane was once a major leaguer himself. He was labeled a &quot;can't miss&quot; star by those who are supposed to be able to predict such things, but ended up achieving marginal success. How Beane is turning the game's accepted notions upside down is the heart of this story.  The 2002 season looked like an impossible one for the A's...they had lost three of their best players to free agency.<br />Everyone thought the game was over them...everyone but Billy Beane.<br />As the book opens, we join Beane and his staff on the day of baseball's amateur draft. We witness the A's enjoy an almost magical success in getting the players they want; in part because few, if any other teams want them. Does Beane know something no one else does? The answer is a qualified yes. It turns out he's putting to work statistical models that have been developed by the writer Bill James and others over the past two decades, This information is widely available and widely known to fans...but given little credence by most of the men who still run the game.<br />As we read on, we learn the logic behind the A's decision to hand their starting first base job to Scott Hatteberg, a former Red Sox catcher who could no longer catch due to an injury; why they coveted Chad Bradford, a pitcher buried in the minors by the White Sox, but who they knew would develop into one of the game's best relievers; why they were willing to trade for all-star second baseman Ray Durham, even though there was no chance they would be able to re-sign him at the end of the season.<br />Lewis' narrative is engaging and vivid. He puts us in the board room and the locker room as the season unfolds. It's a great story, especially for baseball fans, but really worthwhile for anyone intrigued by the idea of what fresh approaches and unconventional thought can bring to an individual or an organization.<br />A grand slam all the way!baseman Ray Durham, even though there was no chance they would be able to re-sign him at the end of the season.<br />Lewis' narrative is engaging and vivid.

B00007LL7O|5.0|The first time i heard Stratovarius i didnt really like them too much...they were good and very talented but something was missing. I went out and bought Elements Pt. 1 and i loved the entire CD (except a drop in the ocean). Every other song is great. Everyone claims Eagleheart is the best...not in my opinion...i like it but not as much as Soul of a Vagabond and Find Your Own Voice. The song elements is an 8 minute epic that is just awesome. And the best song on the CD is Fantasia....a ballad that is just great...the singer soars and after the breakdown it gets heavy. Timo has great solos on this album especially in Soul of a Vagabond. I refer it to the Shredder Ballad Solo. All and all this CD is a must if you are a Stratovarius fan or even just a metal fan in general. 5 stars isnt enough for this CD and it has become one of my Top 10 favorite albums of all time. GREAT CD!!!
