B0001DI0FI|3.0|I found it amusing that Amazon paired this with the Tom Hanks flick Cast Away for the \\"Best Value\\" - these movies are very similar in speed and action.  Way too much getting from point \\"A\\" to point \\"B\\", with little occurring once we arrive at point \\"B.\\"  This is definitely a film about the journey, not the destination, ie, the fast frightening French Frigate (say that five times!)<br />Our intrepid Captain Crowe seems to be a bit behind the times in naval warfare and very slow on the uptake.  One gets the impression that he blunders his way through challenges. I was grateful for the 8x fast forward speed on my DVD player, as I was thankfully able to skip over a lot of the fluff.
B00006AUIG|2.0|I rented this movie (thankfully) because it looked like the type of suspense/thriller movie that I'd enjoy.  I was wrong.  The movie starts out asbestos cleaning crew that wins the bid for an abandoned insane asylum.  What should be a straightforward job, is complicated by the personal histories of the crew. In particular, Hank is dating Phil's old girlfriend, and Gordon's new baby seems to be unnerving him more than should be expected. Things get more complicated as wanna be lawyer Mike plays the tapes from a former patient with multiple personalities, including the mysterious Simon who does not appear until Session 9, and as Hank disappears after finding some old coins.<br />This was supposedly a horror film but I didn't find any chilling or frightening scenes.
B00005JMEW|5.0|What happened when martial arts anime meets cheesy martial arts flicks we used to watch at the drive-ins?  Kill bill. I don't know what it is about this flick, but it has to be watched over and over, with that soundtrack cranked.  Any anime fan can recognize the style of the odd-ball camera angles, unusual close-ups and strange outfits - it's right out of any one of a couple dozen of major anime's.  The close-up of  LUCY LIU's O-Ren Ishii's eyes as she draws her Katana from it's sheath - pure anime. Same with the little school girl look of Go Go Yubari.  And Uma's yellow bike leathers. I've heard some people compare the blood spurting to Monty Python. Sure, MPFS had the excessive blood is a couple of classic bits, but it's in EVERY martial arts anime ever made. Plus the soundtrack really rocks.<br />If you're a fan of anime, martial arts or action flicks, get this movie. I never saw it at the cinema - too bad!
B00006879E|3.0|I did find myself singing along to them a few times in the car... however, they certainly aren't my favorite. If you want something that's easy to listen to but musically a bit more impressive try John Mayer... or, even better, listen to REAL Motown interspersed with some better rock.
B0001LJCPC|4.0|Personally there's only three songs on this album I like - the lone 5,6,7,8's song that was used at the opening fight at the Japanese restaurant, the whistling bit in the hospital corridor, the music for the Thurman /  Lu showdown.  A couple of notes - whistle that tune from the corridor while listening to that 5,6,7,8's song (whoo hoo, whoo, etc. etc.) - almost identical. The sound effects - god, what were they thinking?  Did it look good to get the track count up there?  A waste of space.  Overall, a good compilation, with some really great bits.<br />Plus the CD has a CD extra track containing the movie trailers.
B000001Y5J|4.0|So we've got good old Trent writing songs for this new EP after the immensely popular and widely accepted Pretty Hate Machine (which will be further referred to as PHM).  I think the reason why this album is so much different that his other stuff is because he was excited.  He said to himself, \\"Oh, now that this real band and I are playing together, I'll let everyone in on the creative process.\\"  So he and Danny Lohner (lifetime friends) began to write stuff for Broken, originally meant to be a single for the song Happiness in Slavery.  Here's the my low-down on all the songs on a 10 base rating scale.<br />Pinion<BR>You pop in the CD and you say, \\"What the hell?  Why don't I hear anything?\\"  Then after you check your speaker cables, you can distantly hear this faint \\"Perfect Drug\\"-like guitar.  Then there are some words that are hard to understand.  Basically this one and a half minute song is just a build-up into something fantastic, which is Wish.<BR>4/10<br />Wish<BR>Let me tell you, I first bought NIN's live CD and I loved this song.  It was so different and so rocky and cool.  I was really excited to pick up Broken so I could hear what the original recorded cersion sounded like.  At first, I liked it better live, but then as I started listening to it, the perfection that was recording un-live was just so good.  This heavy vocals and the crunching guitars are an excellent contrast to the tapping of the snare drum during the chorus.  The lyrics are a tad poor though, for Reznor, who is, in my opinion, the best lyricist on the planet.<BR>9/10<br />Last<BR>I was very much so into this song when I first picked up the CD, but then after listening to it so much, I realized that guitar-work was pretty damn tedious and the lyrics even repeated once.  I still can't get enough of the end of the song when he says, \\"I want you to break me,\\" and there's this really distant screaming in the backround.  The screams on this CD are fantastic.  It's a pretty good song.<BR>7/10<br />Help Me I am in Hell<BR>Another build up song that's really similar to Pinion.  I suggest that if you've listened to the CD before, then just skip this one.  <BR>3/10<br />Happiness In Slavery<BR>I've always really enjoyed this song, but it wasn't until lately that I've realized how good it is.  It's a big mix between PHM and The Downward Spiral, but sounds nothing like anything else on Broken.  Once again, the cool synth sounds and the crunching guitar are amazing.  The lyrics are by far the best on the CD (Suck comes close) and I especially love the part in the first chorus where he says, \\"The devils of truth deal the souls of the free.\\"  Also, when the drum machine cuts out and he says, \\"This big broken machine.\\"  This is easily my favorite song on the CD.<BR>10/10<br />Gave Up<BR>Another amazing song with really really cool guitar synth combinations.  The double pedal at the beginning combined with the vocal effect make the song deliciously haunting.  The guitar part is like nothing that Trent has ever written before (I smell Lohner) and the keyboard solo halfway through is very very cool.  I'm not sure if I like this song live better.  They both have outstanding qualities.  The cut and pasting at the end of the song is very very unique and outlandish.  Another very good song.<BR>9/10<br />Song 7-97<BR>All silence, all crap.<BR>0/10<br />Physical<BR>This song is by far the most prolific that NIN has ever done.  It's very very slow with extremely sexual and haunting lyrics.  It's weird, because there are no synth sounds in this song and it works out very well.  <BR>8/10<br />Suck<BR>This may very well be better than Happiness in Slavery.  I love the combination of pre-recorded drum beats while that crazy synth techno noise is playing.  The lyrics in this song are outstanding, especially when he says, \\"I'm Jesus Christ on ecstasy.\\" (Listen to live version for changed lyrics).  The slow drum beat chorus is also very cool.  The bass guitar is a nice change for NIN and the guitar work is very good.  The ending is my favorite part when he just keeps repeating the word Suck.  The final song.  A triumphant end.<BR>9/10<br />This CD is probably my least favorite of NIN's (excluding singles) except I may like it better than PHM.  I suggest you get it though for a rocking good time.  It's very thrash.
0393057658|5.0|Unbelievably compelling story about how the Oakland A's do more with less.  Even if you like statistics and strategy and don't like baseball, it's an amazing read.  To see how this book has effected MLB, simply look at what the Boston Red Sox and Toronto Blue Jays have done over the last few years with regard to their rosters.
068484267X|4.0|Angela's Ashes is definitely a book worth reading! Frank McCourt, the author of this memoir, retells the story of his childhood first in Brooklyn, New York and later in Limerick, Ireland. McCourt suffers a cruel life of poverty, neglect from his alcoholic father, and relentless pressure from the Church and his school yet is able to overcome these obstacles in the end and return to the states to start his life over. I loved this novel and i promise that you will too! Go now and start reading it!
0156027321|4.0|This is the story of Pi Patel, son of an Indian zookeeper, aspiring adept of Hinduism, Christianity and Islam, and immigrant to Canada whose journey takes a fantastic and tortuous detour when he falls victim to a shipwreck and survives 227 days aboard a small lifeboat in the Pacific with only a Bengal Tiger named Richard Parker for company. It is a story of the human spirit, the will to survive and the presence of God. Martel tells it with humour and wit, brutal honesty and an economy of words that makes it impossible to put down. You will laugh, you will be terrified - you will say, &quot;Ah, I see!&quot;. I recommend this book.
0316666343|3.0|the book wasn't the greatest. it could have been better. it was kind of boring.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|The reigning Queen of Pop (Madonna is out, Britney is in) has outdone herself yet again.  \\"In The Zone\\" is Britney's best is one of the best albums of the year hands down.  It has already spawned two #1 singles, 3 #1 TRL videos, and an amazing world tour.<br />Me Against The Music: 3/5 - Not the best lead single off of a Britney album and Madonna doesn't do much for it, either.<br />I Got That (Boom Boom): 4/5 - With an awesome hip-hop vibe and the Ying Yang twins backing her up, Britney shines.<br />Showdown: 4/5 - You'll need to listen to this more than once to see how good it is but this is one of the best songs Britney performs on tour.<br />Breathe On me: 5/5 - Easily the best song on the album with it's trancy vibes and sensual lyrics.  It should be released as a single.<br />Early Mornin': 1/5 - One track that should have been left off the album.  Moby pretty much sucks.  P.Diddy's \\"The Answer\\" should have been put on the album instead of this.<br />Toxic: 5/5 - Another great song that takes Britney to a new level, especially when it comes to the music charts.<br />Outrageous: 2/5 - Britney tries to be too \\"ghetto\\" on the track and R. Kelly proves he's better at having sex with underage girls than helping Britney out.  Sounds good live, though.<br />Touch Of My Hand: 4/5 - Because it deals with masturbation, it stands out on the album but the lyrics, music, and production are slick.<br />The Hook Up: 3/5 - Britney tries to replicate the Caribbean sound with mixed results but it grows on you after a while.<br />Shadow: 4/5 - Finally a Britney power ballad.  While she may not show her range on the track she proves she can hold her own when it comes to singing a slow song.<br />Brave New Girl: 2/5 - While the music sounds good, you can never really get in the grove to this song.<br />Everytime: 5/5 - While Justin had to be a fool and act the way he did regarding the break up, Britney is less arrogant and a lot classier.  Her best song writing to date.
B0001ENY6M|5.0|Enjoyed the movie and now got the soundtrack! It has great tracks especially &quot;Song Of Complaint&quot; that has Azeri source. I recommend this soundtrack for your collection!
B000002OX7|5.0|Indispensible is the only word to sum up this masterwork by The Who. Every song flows seemlessly to the next. The classics are here in spades: Baba O'Riley, Bargain, Behind Blue Eyes, Won't Get Fooled Again. However, it's the lesser know tracks from Who's Next which truly make this The Who's career defining piece. The Song is Over, Naked Eye and Goin' Mobile no doubt rank among some of my all-time favorite songs. Townsend's craftsmanship is nothing less than stellar, his playing flawless. Daltrey's vocals, Townsend's guitar, Entwistle's Bass and Moon's percussion validate The Who's claim that they are the Best Rock and Roll Band in the World and Who's Next is all the evidence you'll need.
B00005YU1O|4.0|I really liked this movie although it is a bit too much.  It was a very ambitious undertaking and was done well but the graphics give you a serious headache after awhile.  Not too many full length films have been made in this style and I can see why.  the interviews were interesting as long as you don't watch them all in one go.
0060922583|5.0|The first two chapters intrigued me greatly. The whole book is great, though the book gets bogged down in the middle with too many descriptions of various supernatural occurrances straight from C. Fort and others to back up the holographic theory. Still, the book is a great read for anyone interested in quantum physics or books such as the Tao of Physics.
B00005JMSE|5.0|You have to see this movie. There are alot of comic book based movies out there, and I think Hellboy is one of the best. If not the best.<br />With tons of action,comedy, great special effects,and a good story Hellboy keeps you on the edge of your seat, and leaves you wanting more.Hell boy is Highly Recommended and you wont be disappointed.I cant wait for the dvd, I hear it will be released on August 1, 2004.
B0000028RR|5.0|Too whomever said that this was for commies and atheists. You are wrong my friend, because they don't have those people, now are they all about anarchy. Just because they say America is unjust and it could be a better place to live does not mean they are anarchists. Another thing, America might be &quot;free&quot; or a good place to live, but does that mean it can't improved opon? No. And America isn't exactally fee either man, we just go a bigger cage! Another thing that capatilism is for the rich, no matter what race or color you are, though generally it is white. Capatilism is a system of the economy were the poor stay poor and the rich get richer. That's why America likes it so much. Land of the free, naw more like the land for the greedy and rich.<br />Sorry for the rant yall, cuz this is some tight music yall. Awsome guitar, bass, drums, and yeah Zack can flow and scream. Very intellegent lyrics, even for a political band such as RATM. They don't just talk about what makes them angry for their &quot;anti-everything&quot;, but things that they see goin' around them that soulnd't be happin' but is none the less. But seriously, great cd awsome group and its a shame that Zack split. Word of advice, check out thier other. I personally like Evil Empire the best, though most say its this one. Either way, good music and lyrics.<BR>Peace
B00003CXA6|5.0|I feel Gettysburg shows the true spirit of the Confederate Army during the Civil War.  It shows that two opposite command styles of Robert E. Lee, and Gen. Longstreet.  It makes these commanders and leaders human to us.  It also shows the devotion to Gen. Lee which made underfed, bare-footed, and uneducated men who were the salt of the earth, follow the Gen into battle against larger numbers and still be successful.<BR>   What struck me the most was when Gen Lee realized that he had made a bad decision at Gettysburg, which cost them the battle and took the blame upon himself.  He appeared to understand that Gen. Longstreet's plan to flank would have been successfull.<BR>   It also gave us an insight to the brillance of Joshuah L. Chamberlain in going from school teacher to Colo in the 20th Maine and leading those men into a successful defense of Little Round Top with a shortage of ammunition and men.
B0001LJCMK|5.0|Another fine piece of Rock 'n' Roll from Mr Homme. Buy everything he's had something to do with for completeness. Check out Kyuss, QOTSA, Mark Lanegan, Mondo Generator, Desert Sessions and more for further examples of his genius.
B0001D0FTW|5.0|This band in the past has been Hard and Heavy while keeping a powerful, mystical and musical aspect to the whole thing, and this new cd &quot;Hellfire Club&quot; is no Exception! This CD is a tad over 1 Hour of some of the Best music I have heard in a long time (Not counting Iron Maiden's latest, &quot;Dance of Death&quot;)!  It opens with &quot;Mysteria,&quot; which sets the level to the album as Tobias screams ... &quot;Welcome to the Freak Show!&quot;  Hands down, &quot;The Piper Never Dies,&quot; is the best song on the CD, and at over 10 min. it sure deserves to be!  Another Favorite is &quot;King of Fools,&quot; which left me singing to it the very first time I heard it. &quot;Navigator&quot; is another classic with the feel of '80 metal blended in with it all.  To sum up this CD, if you are any fan of Metal, enjoy well written songs, great vocals, well done guitar and drums mixes, and a Hell of a catchy album that you will be listening to Over and Over again in the car, at home, where you work, then this CD is most defenety for you!
B000002KHH|3.0|Don't take this band too seriously. They are not Led Zeppelin or the Beatles. The musicianship is primitive, so what. Especially in later albums, the riffs are especially sludgey and uninspired, the lyrics are cheesy, etc. While this is true, Black Sabbath still hold great memories for me, when I was in 7th grade and didn't know or care about any of that. The magic is still there when listening to \\"Planet Caravan\\" or \\"Fairies Wear Boots\\".
B000066NW0|1.0|Have any of these Avril fans posting all these enthusiastic reviews here ever actually heard their idol live in concert? I have, four times. She's AWFUL! She literally cannot carry a tune. She doesn't really play an instrument (she's clearly faking it on stage and in her videos). She doesn't even write her own music--that's done for her by a professional group called Matrix, which also writes tunes for Britney Spears. All she does, as far as I can tell, is write some of the lyrics. Big deal. I'll admit that some of the songs on this album are fun and catchy, but Avril has very little to do with that.<br />Don't believe me? Listen to Avril live in concert: Her voice is screechy, puny, and consistently out of tune. All the credit for this CD belongs to the sound engineers, who ran Avril's \\"singing\\" through a TC-Helicon VoiceOne computer program that corrects for bad pitch and beefs up a thin, weak voice. So if you enjoy this album, thank the engineers, not Avril.<br />So, she can't sing, she can't play an instrument, and she doesn't write her own music. She's not even very pretty. So how in the world did she become a huge pop star? Why did the corporate suits choose this particular untalented person to be the Next Big Thing? Is her Daddy an executive in the music industry? I'm really curious.
B00003CWMI|3.0|Let's just get one thing straight here; this movie is one of the most touching films that I've seen in quite a while. <br />I read the wonderful Asimov \\"short\\" story before I saw the movie, so I had fairly high expectations of this film. Until, that is, I actually read the little blurb at the back of the video:<BR>\\"no run-of-the-mill robot!\\" ?<BR>\\"a crowd-pleasing comedy hit\\" ???<br />Something was wrong here. Surely Hollywood would recognize the extraordinary potential of the story and try to bill it as something more than yet another \\"light comedy\\"?! Right? But then, who was I kidding? The back cover makes it look like yet ANOTHER cliche American family film. Exactly the kind of film I'd avoid watching (Nice, huh? The people who'd normally come to see films like this are scared off by the \\"yet another family comedy\\" advertising!)<br />That's what Hollywood advertised it as, and I have the feeling that the backers of this film were not very pleased with the director's attempts to make this film into something serious. So they fought back! An extremely annoying dancing \\"female\\" robot with a \\"personality\\", dumb jokes about sex; all these are attempts to mould this film into the specified Hollywood formula. <br />Thankfully, they do not fully succeed in ruining this film, but they DO keep it from becoming a true classic. Despite these really stupid Hollywood throw-ins, the film still remains primarily an intelligent film, similar in tone to Asimov's stories. It deviates significantly from the story, but surprisingly most of the deviations are not bad, and are well thought-out. There is more humour, too, than in Asimov's stories. Most of it is intelligent, and was actually quite funny to me.<br />The exception, of course, is the scene where Andrew starts following a sexy female robot. Which idiot cooked up this dumb idea?! First of all, he's a ROBOT; he is attracted to people/robots because of their personality, never because of their physical form! Secondly, that female robot defies practically everything that Asimov ever wrote about robots, up to and including the Three Laws of Robotics (she actually defies her owner in one scene, violating the Second Law)!<br />Besides that, the deviations from the story mainly function to make this a film for the heart more than for the head. A typical Hollywood gimmick, but it really works here, especially in the heartwrenching final scene. <br />Even so, I would have liked to see more on the resistance that Andrew encountered when dealing with ordinary human society; a lot of his interactions with the outside world from the story were removed or conveniently skimmed over in the movie, including most of the legal battles and the issue of him still having to obey the Three Laws of Robotics (which are hardly even mentioned in the movie after the first 30 minutes or so, unlike in the book where they were almost a central issue).<br />Overall, this is a better-than average Hollywood film that has been noticeably ruined by \\"input\\" from Hollywood producers (this is my guess here). Ideally, this movie should have been given a lot more priority than it was; this IS after all based on one of the best stories of one of the 20th century's most famous science fiction writers! As it is now, it's a shame to see that this movie wasn't brought up to its full potential. 7/10.<br />I'd like to see a director's cut someday...!
1592400876|5.0|I had been seeing this odd title scattered throughout my Internet travels, but had no idea what it was. When I had a chance to get a free copy of the book, I jumped on it, wanting to know what it was all about.<br />My friends have many reasons to think me odd and my choice of books is one of them. Only Douglas, they might think, could get excited about a book on punctuation. While I wholeheartedly agree that I am odd in many ways, many other people in Britain and America have found this book interesting as well. It is reassuring to know, sometimes, that I am not alone in my madness.<br />While the subject matter, the use (and abuse) of punctuation such as apostrophes, commas, semicolons and the like, may seem dry to most people, Truss' (oh, goodness, I hope I placed that apostrophe correctly) writing style is light, humorous and dry as a Los Angeles summer. I regularly found myself laughing out loud at some of her examples of horrible punctuation, and then quietly wondering to myself if I had committed similar faux pas in my own writing over the years.<br />Misplaced commas and apostrophes, abused or forgotten semicolons and colons not only make us look a bit foolish, but hamper the very communication we are desperately trying to achieve.<br />A few years ago, Lynne Truss presented a show on BBC Radio 4, Cutting a Dash, where she developed many of the ideas and examples for this book. Only in the UK could you have support for a regular show about punctuation. You have to love the British sometimes.<br />This edition for American audiences is exactly the same as the British version and might throw some American readers for a loop. Fear not, though. Even if you don't know what a &quot;high street&quot; is, or stumble over the concept of a &quot;green grocer&quot;, the lessons, humor and fun of this book come through.<br />If I ever had to study punctuation as a class again, I certainly hope this would be my textbook. In fact, this book might just help students find the fun, and usefulness, of the English language better than dry dissertations on the use of the semicolon.<br />While Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves has left me a bit self-conscious about my own writing, the refresher course in punctuation will serve me well for years to come.he fun, and usefulness, of the English language better than dry dissertations on the use of the semicolon.<br />While Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves has left me a bit self-conscious about my own writing, the refresher course in punctuation will serve me well for years to come.
0670451495|5.0|What can I say that everyone else hasn't already? This is probably one of the finest children's books ever written.  Its illustrations are richly detailed and vivid even in two-tone, and its story is adorable and wholesome.  We're FROM Boston and we've recently moved away, and my little boy always thrills to recognize the Boston Gardens he remembers, but set in times past.  The story is sneakily very educational, integrating in plain English information about the migration, mating and molting habits of ducks into an engaging and whimsical story about a mother duck taking care of her own.  It also teaches about counting, nature observation, social studies (explaining the different jobs of a police officer) and alphabetization  (The names of the ducklings will never fail to make your little one giggle.) We've had it for two years, and it remains one of my son's favorite bed time stories. Truly a classic that belongs in any child's library.
B00006ZCFH|3.0|Okay, no doubt this review will either 1)get ignored or 2)get a bunch of \\"I did not find this review helpful\\" votes. But, whatever.<BR>I'll say up front, I am a fan of Erykah Badu. I own everything she's ever released. In fact, I bought \\"Worldwide Underground\\" as soon as it dropped without having heard a note on it.<BR>I'm sad to say, though, that I was a little disappointed.<BR>Yes, I GET that it's transitional. And I GET that she was trying to experiment, which is admirable. And I GET that she wanted to expand the parameters of  Neo-Soul, both in terms of sonic textures and running times (\\"I Need You\\" and \\"Bump It\\" clock-in at around 10 minutes each.) And in some ways, it reminds me a bit of albums like Isaac Hayes' \\"Hot Buttered Soul,\\" where there's only a handful of tracks and the grooves unfold sometimes over the course of fifteen-twenty minutes. But this EP (it's only 10 songs deep) struggles because of lack of focus.<BR>Don't get me wrong, there are some great ideas and moments on here. The last couple of minutes of \\"Bump It\\" where Badu vocalizes with Karon Wheeler and Zap Mama are mesmerizing. And \\"Back in the Day (Puff)\\" was one of the best songs of 2003, hands-down--it hits you from the beginning with a tight beat, catchy hook, and clever vocals.  It's signature Erykah Badu. Plus, the new version of \\"Love of My Life\\" where she freaks \\"Funk You Right On Up\\" by the Sequence (with Angie Stone, a.k.a. Angie B, on vocals) is flawless.  \\"Think Twice\\" is also so soulful that it hurts; its just a bit too truncated. <BR>But then it all kind of falls apart with the grab bag of tracks on the rest of the album, which vary between playing it super safe (\\"The Grind\\" and \\"Danger\\") and experimenting to the point of being aimless. The latter is true on \\"I Need You,\\" where a monotonous, one-note-played-over-a-heartbeat intro lasts almost two minutes before the groove even gets going, and then it never REALLY gets going.  Around the 8-minute mark, it dissolves into a distorted jam session, which just about the time you think will segue into a Funkadelic-type chunk o' funk, it fades out into (yet another) rehashing of \\"Sometimes\\" off \\"Baduizm.\\" (\\"Woo\\" probably is hot when she does it live, but here it falls flat.) And speaking of \\"Baduizm,\\" \\"Danger\\" is the other side of the other side of \\"The Other Side of The Game.\\" (If Neo-Soul is dead, like the cover art indicates, no use beating it to death...)<BR>Anyway, the warning is: don't expect a full-fledged album. This is more a loose mix of unfinished thoughts, clever ideas, and developing genius. It's worth buying simply for \\"Back in the Day,\\" if nothing else.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|4.5/5<br />Thought most of the songs on the album I don't like, it's good music, but not really my style. &quot;Everytime&quot; her third single from this album, is the song which drew me into the album, it's an amazing ballad, definitely Britney's best written song/best song, period. This song also features an amazing emotional video that really suits the song to prefection. &quot;Toxic&quot; is a very good popish song, video is really funky with special effects, second single from the album. Those are really the only songs I like, though they're all good songs for pop music lovers. If you're a fan of Britney, or pop music in general (with a female singer, of course) you'll enjoy the album, so pick it up today! you may be impressed. =)
0784011176|2.0|I rented this movie thinking it would be very good and interesting to a point but I found the nudity and explict sex sceens disguisting. The sex sceens and nudity I found pointless for this film. I understand it was part of the story but it could have been less more to a PG-13 rating. Harvey Kitel's frontal nudity sceen was horrible and gross. (...)
B0001CNPLI|5.0|Tarantino loves this movie as do I! A bloody, gushing, ultra-violent shogun film released in 1980 (dubbed in English) in the USA as a drive-in style limited release. It quickly became a cult<BR>classic and the first time I saw it was late-night Showtime around 1981. Anyway, in KILL BILL VOL.2, you can hear the voice-over of the child-warrior in the background as Uma Thurman watches the film with her small daughter. David Carradine (Bill)<BR>then says, &quot;Oh, no. It's too violent!&quot; and exits the bedroom. This is a very rare video and has been out of print for a long time. I highly reccomend it and give it 5 out of 5 stars.  Shot entirely on location in Japan. Bloody good fun!
0399226907|5.0|I remember reading the Hungry Caterpillar by Eric Carle when I was little, and it was one of my favorite ones to read then.  So now that I'm a mother, I decided to buy this book for my daughter; maybe it will be her favorite too.  The Hunry Caterpillar is a wonderful story and has brilliant illustrations.  I particular like it that it can teach very young children to count to five and the days of the week.<br />I have been reading this book since my daughter was three months old and even after a few months of me reading this to her she likes this one the best.  I recommend the board book over the one with the paper pages especially if you are just starting to read to your infant...the board books tend to last longer when they start to grab at the pages.
0688163173|5.0|This is a really powerful thriller. I liked all the twists and turns and was sad to have it end. A fun weekend read. I'm a definite fan. I highly recommend this book and two others for a good read &quot;The Da Vinci Code, and &quot;He Never Called Again.&quot;
B00005JMFQ|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. I saw it twice in the theatre and several times on DVD already. Normally, I would get annoyed with so many different storylines because it can get confusing and you don't feel connected to the characters. But somehow this movie made me feel for each individual situation, whether it be feelings of happiness or of heartbreak. Not only is it a lovey dovey, feel good movie- it's also hilarious. I think it has enough romance for women and enough comedy for men. My husband and I both love it. I have nothing but good things to say.
B00001OH7O|5.0|(...)All I can say is that I'm glad I gave this time the propper amount of time to really seep in because now I'm a full blown David Bowie convert. As far as this album goes this is the one where David Bowie really finds his sound. If you hear Space Oddity first that one has it's moments but it doesn't resonate as well as the next 4 albums. Also, I'd just like to add that Queen Bitch is one of the most underrated songs and I just gotta say that song is one of my all time favorite Bowie songs.
B00001PE4D|5.0|(...)when i rented this movie casue i heard it was pretty good...After I watched it i could not stop thinking about how good it was! in fact! its the best movie ive ever seen! the actors were really good and you really could feel what the characters where feeling sometimes.  THe best part of the movie is the end cause it is just soooo good! if you have not seen this movie, and you like comedy, drama, and suspence.  Dont rent this movie...BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!! YOU WONT REGRET IT[!!!!]
0060392886|5.0|First off I just gotta say I never cared for hair metal but I gotta say I really enjoyed this book. It's dirty, raunchy, and full of sleazey drug use. The book is written in a way where all 4 of the members plus a varying cast of characters all contribute to telling the history of Motley Crue. It's a nice format because when you hear about stuff like Vince quitting the band you'll get a good idea of the tension that was mounting after reading Nikki's, Tommy's, and Vince's account of the events that lead to the split.  So in my opinion it's a really nice format that works out well with this kind of story. Also, I just want to add that this book will pave the way for more books and stories to come. Due to it's success there's a Metallica movie in the works that is going to try to focus on the drugs and alcohol and the more seamier underside of the band. And in addition after you read this book if you still have a hankering for some more hair metal and debauchery be sure to rent the amazing 'Decline of Western Civilization: The Metal Years'. That movie will blow you away, and give you more insight into the bands that were on the cusp of fame.
B000055Y12|3.0|After 1966's &quot;Torn Curtain&quot; flopped, Hitchcock decided to make another spy thriller. &quot;Topaz&quot;, based on Leon Uris's best - selling novel of the same name, is meant to be an exciting, suspenseful espionage thriller involving nuclear missiles in Cuba. Despite a few engaging sequences, that show Hitch still had it, the film comes off as a second - rate James Bond flick rather than a Hitchcock masterpiece.<br />John Forsythe (the only recognizable actor in the entire cast) plays a CIA agent who recruits a French Operative named Devereaux (Frederick Stafford, who gives a great performance despite the film's flaws)to help him find out if rumors of Russian missiles in Cuba are true. His investigation leaves behind a string of casualities who either kill themselves or get murdered. The plot seems cool, but it's slow - moving and hard to follow at some points.<br />The main thing that keeps &quot;Topaz&quot; afloat is the top - notch acting. Hitchcock clearly thought that great acting would triumph over starpower, which is why he filled the cast with highly talented unknowns. In the past, legends like Sean Connery, Jimmy Stewart, Cary Grant, Gregory Peck, Ingrid Bergman, Grace Kelly, and a host of others starred in Hitchcock masterpieces and gave great performances in their roles, but at same points were unconvincing. The acting in &quot;Topaz&quot; is flawless; I recommend it.
6304117752|5.0|I am from india and I saw ths movie when i was in school.<BR>Though i have hummed the songs ever since I was in kindergarten<br />The original movie starring Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer is undoubtably one of the classic musicals of all time.<br />It is a treat for all young and old and is one of the movie sone should not miss for a lllifetime<br />The movie is indeed a real life story of Maria And Captian Von Trapp  Whether it is fact or fantasy can be proved  because it is asusmed that there is a book &quot;Tha Family On Wheels&quot;<BR>which happens to be the autobiography of MAria.<br />The story of the Von Trapp family does not end with<BR>thei fleeing to America. But it is believed that the Captain, MAria and the seven children fled to America , worked vewry hard there and built an even larger estate than which they had in Salzburg<br />I wish i could get hold of the copy of that book
B00005O5CM|5.0|WHAT CAN I SAY! This movie rocks. Reese Witherspoon playes strong blond female character Elle Woods who enroles in Harvard Law school to get her high school love back and finds out that she can b something more that &quot;a Victoria secret model&quot; (not that there is anything rong with Victoria) I recomend this film to any1 who loves a fun filled, blond movie, or loves strong female characters :-) because blondes have way more fun.<br />Elle proves that is you believe in yur self u can do anyfin :-)
B0001DI0FI|3.0|Don't get me wrong.  This is one of the best movies of the year and probably the best seafaring film in the last thirty (not counting submarine movies), but this DVD could take a cue or two from the franchise that totally beat it out last year The Lord of the Rings.  Peter Jackson knows how to treat his fans and he knows that giving us something besides the pathetic HBO first look documentary and only a FEW, albeit insightful, behind the scenes vignettes can go a long way to racking up DVD sales and creating a buzz around a film with the DVD release instead of it being some forgotten day in the middle of April (oh, did Master and Commander come out this week?  Maybe I'll pick that up sometime).<br />Who else is tired of DVDs proclaiming deleted scenes as such a big bonus?  Either incorporate them back into the movie or get rid of them.  It seems all the studio or Peter Weir has to do is sweep up the cutting room floor and dump all of the garbage onto a disc and we'll buy it for a few dollars more (well I did, but you don't have to).<br />No commentary either.  None.  LOTR has no less than four.  FOUR per movie.  This film, one of the greatest historical dramas and historically accurate portrayals of the napoleonic wars (not actual events, but methods) gives us no insight from the mind behind the movie (director and co-writer of a truly fantastic period script as far as period scripts go).  Peter Weir has to wake up.  I consider him to be among the few directors to have never had a misstep in his career (Fearless being the closest).  All he does is make perfect movies, but a little love for emerging technology couldn't hurt his fan base.  I would even have settled for a Collee or Crowe commentary.  Anything.  <br />To sum up.  This is a five star movie, but a three star DVD.  The other version is a two star DVD, but for 5 bucks less it's probably worth it because you still get the best part - the movie.
0767802624|1.0|This was a pathetic movie.  It had absolutely no substance, wit, or comedy.  The comedy attempts in this movie were worse than 007.  This is basically the \\"plot\\"-<BR>Wow we are part of a secret organization to kill bad aliens that are threatening our way of life.  In order to do this we must have super cool guns, black suits, and a little stick that flashes to make us lose our memory.  A cool car would also be nice.  How original!<BR>This movie comes recommended for the maybe 10 year old girl who would most likely have the following conversation with a friend about the movie:<BR>\\"omg luvs that movie was soooo cute!  And omg like that Will Smith is like ToO hOt! those lil aliens were cute to.  Will Smith is like SoOoOo dreamy!  C U l8r alligator! hehe! :)\\" <BR>here, we have the 10 year old girl who likes the movie because they think Will Smith is hot and the little aleins are cute.  <BR>The other group I would recommend this movie would be to the maybe 13 year old boy:<BR>\\"wow dude those guns were like so cool.  The aliens were so hardcore and I liked watching things being blown up with the guns!  That was almost as good as the Fast and the Furious!  Nice car!  The rap music in it was so cool too because rap is awesome!\\"<BR>Obviously, the fast and furious crowd who enjoys rap music and watching things being blown up with fake guns would also enjoy this movie.  Woah, cool dude!<br />If you are not one of these types of people, dont watch the movie.  It is extremely cheesy, boring, and bad.  I cant believe I watched it.
B0001DI0FI|4.0|If you expect this movie to be a standard war picture or Hollywood version of life in another century you will be sadly disappointed.  If, instead, you come to the film with an open mind and curiousity about what life aboard a British Navy ship in another century was like, you will be fascinated, amazed, apalled, overwhelmed, and a hundred other emotions space does not permit listing.<br />I saw it after attempting to read the books and was blown away.  The film is a wonderful adaptation of 2 of Patrick O'Brien's works.  Oddly enough (and I'm not the only one to mention this) it is like coming in during the telling of a tale and leaving before the next installment.  The film is a story within a story of life on the sea.  Beautifully filmed, with wonderful actors.  A good addition to the library.
B0000640VO|5.0|This is probably my favorite movie of all time.  The colors that are chosen are very beautiful, it seems as if everything has a greenish tint which is really interesting.  The music in this movie is incredibly beautiful, and is quite possibly the best soundtrack ever made.  The movie itself is just plain fun!  I usually despise romantic comedies, but if thats what you want to call this movie (it really bridges the gap between genres but..), this is an exception.  The first 10 minutes are just brief character synopsis, and you will find how quirky and fun this movie is right from the start (the suicidal fish!  I love it!)  I'd have to say the BEST part of this movie, though, is the garden gnome!  The DVD also has the original language track in Parisian French which is interesting to listen to.  Such an amazing movie!  I would highly recommend it to anyone open-minded enough to deal with a little bit of sex.
B000148KK2|4.0|Overall, I must say that I am pleased.  It is still a good CD & I remain infatuated with Diana's voice. She has such depth and abilities that rival any jazz diva.<br />The orginal cuts, about 4 or 5, are good, and showcase her vocal talent only moderately well.  She can still tickle the heck out of those keys on that piano.  She is blessed with excellent artists to accompany her.<br />Diana is obviously most adored and known for her remakes and arrangements of the timeless classics.  If this is what you are looking for, you will be only satiated - not overwhelmed as Diana has historically performed.  However, after listenting to the album numerous times, and you get away from the notion of expecting the classics remastered, you will enjoy what she has blessed us with. <br />As the DK fan that I am, I would still highly recommend it.  Don't listen for the classics - listen for the jazz. Her voice is incredible and unique and is masterful in how it plays with inflections with the classics.  I give it a 4 out of 5 stars.  I only hold back the 5th star imagining that her sophmore effort of expressing her own compositions will be stunning.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie.  First of all, people who after seeing this movie that try to seperate or figure out what was real and what wasnt are entirely missing the point of the movie.  Just have fun with it!<br />The characters are amazing in this movie.  Whether its the witch with the glass eye or Danny DeVito as the little circus man (he fits right in) or the Giant, the characters are larger than life and are very creative.  In Big Fish, all of the characters are pretty central to the plot (in a way) which was another plus.  All of the girls I went to the movie with were crying by the end.  It was both fun and emotional at the same time.  This was an extremely well done movie and I highly recommend it to anyone.  If you havent seen this yet, you are in for a treat!
B000089RVX|5.0|The songs on here ar enothing but beautiful . people dislike it cause most people get offended by someone who can sing and looks like thier precious scene . whatever these people are ''goth , ''christian'' .. who the hell cares . its the music we are reveiwing .. whats this overrated bull , that person is seriously in need of a brain . lets see , bands who are unheard of are better ? bleh no , there are crappy bands that are unheard of also . this cd is just beautiful . origin was beautiful also . its painful and the lyrics mean a great deal to me and she can sing , so yeh why wouldnt i get this .
B00005JMJ4|2.0|Quite frankly, this movie was average.  I am a person that usually loves independent or foreign movies, and that seemed to be when this movie came out the audience that it appealed to.  i just dont get it.  The only thing special about this film that I noticed was its attempt to be &quot;realistic&quot; and extremely melancholy boring feel, a type of portrait into the life of a buisnessman on a buisness trip or something (what could be more exciting!).  There is next to no plot.  Some people think that this is artistic or original.  It may very well be original, because most film makers aren't stupid and/or brave enough to make a movie without a plot.  I went into this movie open minded, I do to any movie that doesn't have Vin Diesel or Paul Walker in the cast, but this movie was just boring.  It isn't what I would call intellectually stimulating.  I suppose that you are kind of wondering at the end, but I didn't even care to try to find the &quot;deepness&quot;.  Sometimes I wonder that in movies like this if everyone likes them just because their friends and/or favorite critics do.  Whatever<br />I was extremely disappointed that this seemed to beat Big Fish in practically every award for comedy this year.  David Lynch, Darren Aronofsky, Tim Burton, these are good film makers whos films stimulate the mind and have an orignal flair and a plot at the same time (yes, its possible).  This movie, in my opinion, just didn't have it.  It could have just as easily been a made for tv movie and the people who are giving it 5 stars now would be giving it 1 star for its cheesiness and bad filming.  Big Fish deserved the awards.
B000089RVX|1.0|Your one of those people who dress &quot;gothic&quot; and walk around the mall looking depressed even though your life is perfect and you have $100 in your pocket.
B00005R87Q|1.0|This movie was absolutely pathetic.  It is everything that is wrong with America.  The music is obnoxious and moronic, the acting sucks, (...) the plot was wretched, it was horrible!  There arent enough adjectives to describe the horror of this movie.  \\"Cool\\" cars, \\"hot\\" women (not really Michelle Rodriguez kinda has a mustache), gangsters, racing, in other words totally original (haha)!  The WORST thing about this movie though is that it spawned the creation of other films similar to it that disease our society and rot our minds like XXX, 2Fast2Furious, to name the most obvious.
B00006879E|2.0|These guys are really annoying. They do sound a little bit like a boyband, every song is about girls and love, and plus theirs just as much synthesizers as there is guitar. The drums are drum machine quality, and the bass? Hah! Is there even any bass being used? The guitar is very choppy except for in &quot;Harder To Breathe&quot;. Listen to the chorus of &quot;This Love&quot;, the guitar sounds really bad. If you want a bunch of love songs with more synthesizers than guitar, then this is for you.
0790729725|5.0|Ray Liotta, Roert Di Niro and Joe Pesci, three of the greatest actors today put together in this outstanding, sick, twisted, dark and funny thriller based on Mafia and Gangster life. The story revolves around Ray Liotta's charecter, Henry Hill, while on his teen years in the early 50s decides to hang around the wrong crowd not knowing that it would competely change his life, as from henchman to mafia don, then realising his ruthless figure to society and how closer his enemies are getting including his own people hungry to get to his position, he flees throughout seven states in eager search of protection. Outstanding preformance from oscar winning supporting actor, Joe Pesci and Oscar winning phenomenal legendary actor, Robert Di Niro. A true gangster film and oscar winning success. This is truly a collectors item and a must see.10/10.
B000002I99|5.0|In the past, Alice Cooper has always put on a show at his concerts. But with the Welcome To My Nightmare tour, they cranked it up a notch or two with many creative props and special effects. <br />During one song, giant spiders chased Alice on huge spider webs. And to the tune of \\"Some Folks,\\" skeletons in top hats, capes, and canes danced in step with each other. Of course, the bone people were merely performers wearing skin-tight, black leotards, with the image of life-size skeletons on them. But the effect worked. <br />Another memorable effect was the scene during \\"Only Women Bleed.\\" At one point in this song, Alice grabbed a woman-sized doll and started puching and kicking her. He threw her all over the place. You could tell it was an inflatable doll when he twisted her around the bed post of a huge bed on stage. Eventually he threw the doll down and hopped into bed next to her. After a few moments, as he continued singing, the doll slowly sat up, got out of bed, and began walking around the stage. It was a real woman.<br />The directors of this concert deserve an award. The switch between the battered doll and real woman went completely unnoticed. No doubt, they employed the services of a magician or two for this tour.  <br />Towards the end of the concert, a gigantic monster came out onto the stage. Alice Cooper fought it and eventually won the battle. He decapitated the beast with a sword and proudly carried its head around the stage as the audience cheered. <br />But the greatest trick of all came earlier in the show when Alice layed on a guillotine and had his own head cut off. After the blade dropped, and his head fell into a basket below, his headless body got up, walked over and picked it up. With the head dangling from his fist by the hair, the headless Alice used the other hand to put the microphone up to the mouth of the head, and it finished singing the song. <br />I kid you not. This scene blew me away. I saw it at the Spectrum, in Philadelphia, in1975 and I'll never forget it. At that concert, Alice Cooper gave us our money's worth. He is a true rock and roll performer.
B00000K19E|5.0|Marix is a new, fresh, out of this world movie, focusing on other things beside the endangerment of the earth which is so cliche, this is the begining of greater Sci-Fi movies to come and will open the future of dark humor sci fi's and crazy cool action sequences, this movie has it all, Great actors, one of the most greatest storylines in the world, and my favorite, action. If you haven't watched this yet, now is your chance to own the trilogy and you'll witness true hollywood, ture action, fresh sci fi and out of this world storyline. 10/10.
B0001DI0FI|2.0|I have to include myself in the \\"not impressed\\" minority here, simply because any story or depth is lacking. The movie is well made, no one doubts that, and it looks incredible. There are moving scenes, and most of those involve either the little blonde haired kid (you either feel sorry for him, or think he's uber-courageous), or the doctor of the ship feeling sorry for himself because he can't study the islands. The movie tries hard to have \\"depth\\" by adding these side stories of the Galapagos islands rest-stop, the \\"sensitive\\" doctor, and the \\"wow, those are little kids in the midst of battle!\\" But these portions aren't explored enough to really add much flavor to story that's basically about a ship trying to engage in battle with another ship. French ship blasts English ship, English ship limps away and hides, English ship recovers, English ship searches French ship for revenge. The rest, the human story, is just garnish. It was like drinking sugar water. No nutrition here at all. However, they do try hard to add a sense of atmosphere and history. Which works. For awhile.<br />(...)
B000099T2L|4.0|Since her first single &quot;Crazy in love&quot; fans have been hooked with Beyonce. This cd was really well made. I enjoyed to it alot. The only song I can honestly say I wasnt really feeling was the &quot;Signs&quot; Song. Yes, buy this album its a good investment. She didnt win all those awards for this cd cuz of being overated or w/e... She has an incredible voice and will be around for a long time. When her next album drops its gonna be insane and your gonna wanna get what you've missed so buy this album now. Trust in me, you wont regret it.
B00008LDPU|5.0|This is must had for die hard matrix fan, eventhought some of movie has little related to the film, however is overall is good unique experience.
0618526412|2.0|this is one of those books picked by people who still wish they were young. it is a good book for prepubescent or teen-age girls and  not for anyone else. there are lots of these floating around, after all this one is over 60.  they should normally quietly fade away, till someone unearths the moldy carcass for it to rise again, and quickly sink into the oblivion from which it came
B0000AQVCL|5.0|This album definatly has re-play power. Like a lot of the reviewers say you can most definately hear who their influences were. I think it's great that new bands are looking to those who influenced them. I hope they have another album in the works.
B000002JPA|3.0|You can draw a line through this band - it's obvious what makes this band great, and also obvious what holds them back. On one side there is vast instrumental sections, highly developed understanding of music and theory, and a virtuoso's developed chops. On the other there is high whiny vocals that don't fit this band's style, pessimistic and uninspired lyrical content, and sometimes pretentious and unneeded solo sections. I suggest LIQUID TENSION EXPIRIMENT for all who like Dream Theater but, like me, had problems getting past these setbacks. The need to be heavy doesn't seem to be there, and the songs are shorter, and thought out well, no vocals to worry about, + ex Crimson bassist Tony Levin. You can bet it's good. I am not trying to downplay Dream Theater in any way; They are a great band. I have seen them live and witnessed firsthand their virtuosity, and I am only pointing out their disadvantages and what they need to work on.
B00009V7PJ|5.0|I saw CHER in Atlanta on April 25, 2003, and it will always be THE GREATEST NIGHT OF MY LIFE!  I grew up watching the Sonny &amp; Cher show on tv, and playing Cher songs on my record player over and over and over, I must have played &quot;The Way of Love&quot; and &quot;Gypsies, Tramps, and Thieves&quot; and &quot;Dark Lady&quot; a thousand times, and I sat there in Philips Arena watching her sing these songs, and it was as if it were a dream come true.  Every minute was magnificent, every song was simply sensational!  The entire arena rocked and thundered when she did &quot;Bang Bang, My Baby Shot Me Down,&quot; and it was hard to believe it was a 57 year old woman on stage, singing that song!  The concert didn't stop for even a minute, all the way through until the final song, &quot;Believe,&quot; that really brought down the house, with the dancers both on stage and flying through the air on wire.  Yep, the night was magnificent, and this dvd captures it completely and wonderfully.  Cher, you really are the greatest ever!!
B0001HLVSC|4.0|Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World is my kind of movie.  The quality of production is very high, the acting is high caliber, and the fighting scenes are well-done.  It is what an action/adventure film should be.<br />Too many action/adventure films rely on special effects, lots of explosions, and star charisma to entertain the audience.  Unfortunately, most such films tend to feature sub-par acting, lousy script, and a loose plot.  However, Master and Commander manages to entertain the audience with superb acting performances from Russell Crowe, Paul Bettany, and the young Max Pirkis.  There's a lot of action, however, not enough to overwhelm the plot of the film or the characters.<br />To me, this film falls in the same category(...).  It is high quality adventure.
B0001N1RU8|1.0|I'm sorry but this is Diana's WORST album to date...bar none.I own all of her CD material to date and have never been more disappointed as I was when I heard this one.<br />Her musical meanderings on the keyboard and introspective lyrics on her collaborative efforts with her hubby are material that anyone with HALF her talent could have done at least if not better on.The writing is trite and not worthy of her.<br />I would like to blame Costello for \\"bringing her down\\" but it's recorded now so she must have been as pleased to play them as collaborate on them.So no, I won't take the easy out.<br />There are a few moments of the Diana we all know and love but they are too few and VERY far between.<br />Does she feel the need to break out of the successful groove she's been in for the past few years? Is that what this is about?<br />If so she has failed miserably.This just isn't her.She chose to record  material that  for the most part doesn't fit her at all and  even worst chose to write material with her hubby that is so far out there musically it almost hurts to listen to.<br />Do NOT buy this CD under any circumstances!!Want the REAL Diana Krall to stand up? Go buy ANY previous CD of hers and you won't be disappointed.That is where the REAL mccoy resides!!!
0694003611|5.0|One of my favorite books when I was little, now it's one of my son's favorites!  He loves to look at the pictures, and it's stood up to his beatings so far!
B00003CX9E|3.0|Yeah, this movie is a classic, so what? People now days seem to think that if it was black and white and made in the 50's that it's a great movie. Citizen Kane is a sometimes interesting movie about a man's life story very similar to that of William Randolph Hearst. Yet the movie is poorly acted except for Orson Welles (Charles Foster Kane), and the plot isn't very intruiging either. ( A man separated from his parents creates a big newspaper franchise and makes it big, but it falls apart later). The best thing about this movie was the head-scratching mystery of Kane's last word, &quot;Rosebud&quot;.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Just an awesome movie overall!  A little gory at times, but in a comedic way, to lessen the intensity.  Fantastic acting and fight scenes.  Just terrific!
B00005AQE8|5.0|This double disc album gives the cd a double effect. Book 1 in my opinion is better than Book 2, cuz in this one, 'Pac spits better rhymes then in book 2. Also the singles released from the album all come out from the first disc (Book 1). If I had to rate each disc i would give 5 stars to disc 1 and 4 to disc 2, cuz in disc one there is more originality in production and in the rap itself than in disc two. My personal top ten songs from both discs are the following (in order):<br />1. Only God Can Judge Me (Disc 1): Absolutely GREAT song, which majes it the best one from all the others in both cds! Great lyrics about how people judge Tupac and his homies badly and the sadness occuring in the ghetto streets. Plus an awsome beat and synths which blend it with funk as well. JUST GREAT!!!<br />2. I Ain't Mad At Cha (Disc 1): Another lyrically astonishing song, which got a great slow beat mixed with piano notes which flow perfectly with 2pac's raps.<br />3. No More Pain (Disc 1): It's one of my very personal favourite. production is EXCELLENT, JUST EXCELLENT, can't be better, thanks to DeVante! 2pac's unleashes all his anger in his menacing lyrics during all the song!! One to check Out foe sure!!<br />4. Can't C Me (Disc 2)<br />5. Life Goes On (Disc 1)<br />6. Ambitionz Az A Ridah (Disc 1)<br />7. Wonda Why They Call U B---- (Disc 2)<br />8. All Eyez On Me (Disc 2)<br />9. California Love (RMX) (Disc 1)<br />10. Holla At Me (Disc 2)<br />Conclusion: One of the veRRRRy best rap albums ever to hit the stores! Just a great classic from the master 2Pac after the best one: Me Against The World!

B000002P72|5.0|This cd is one of the all time great vlues albums, and I am thankful that it has been restored onto cd, for further generations of bleus fans.  This is classic BB in fine voice, and playing jazz riffs on his guitar.
0307120007|3.0|It's a cute book, but very dated.  Not very sturdy either.  I cringe whenever my son reaches for it, but that's not too often, as it doesn't hold his interest very well.
B00009W0WM|5.0|Simply put, this is a timeless classic from thee title song to Bogart's last lines &quot;This could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.&quot;  The best movie of all time, beyond critisizm,
B00003CX8Y|5.0|I've loved this movie since the first day I saw it in the theatre.  This DVD just brings it all back.  The new song does add to the movie, and the extras are fantastic.  The &quot;salvaging&quot; of the original film is really noticeable.  Everything looks so beautiful!  An added plus:  My 19 month old likes it, too!  A must own!

What is nice is that this is a pretty affordable way to get all of the Police's recordings in one package.<BR>When I review a boxed set, I like to start by looking at the packaging since that is a key element in addition to the content. It seems that nowadays everything that is above 2 CDs that is considered a &quot;Boxed Set&quot;. There really have become 2 categories of Boxed Sets. The first is a &quot;Classic Boxed Set&quot;. This comes in a covered box about the size of an LP and contains CDs (sometimes in jewel cases, sometimes just on the bottom of the box) and a book about the same size. The second type is more like a 5.5&quot; x 10&quot; hardcover book which I term &quot;Hardcover Box Set'. The CDs basically are stored in the hardcover binding and the book is in the middle. I much prefer what I call the Classic Boxed Set to the Hardcover format. The &quot;Message in a Box&quot; set is a Hardcover format. This is disappointing to me because for a 'Complete' collection, I would have liked to see the &quot;Classic Boxed&quot; presentation.<br />The book that is contained in the set is outstanding.   The book opens with a profile of how things looked for the Police in 1976, just as the band was coming together.  Then there are individual biography/profiles devoted to the three band members - Stewart Copeland, Sting, and Andy Summers.  Right before the Summers bio, there is a section on how Stewart and Sting joined forces.  Following the bios, there is a detailed profile of the history of the band.   In addition to the many photos, there are sidebars that form a timeline of important dates in the band's history.   Each of the sections of the history of the band is devoted to the different studio albums that the band put together.   There is even a section that chronicles how the Police would dissolve as well as profiles on what the band members did after the Police.   There is a small section devoted to the B-Sides and obscure releases with comments by each of the band members.   Then there is a photos section of singles and albums.   A detailed discography adorned with album, single, and video covers is also featured.   Finally, each song in the set has a list of credits of songwriting and production credits.  The nice thing is how you learn what band members wrote what songs.<br />As for the content, this speaks for itself.  Every major studio recording is included in the set and then some.   Everything is put in order on the CDs from the first single &quot;Fallout&quot; to the last song &quot;Don't Stand So Close to Me '86 (released on the Every Breath You Take: The Singles&quot; greatest hits.     The rare and B side stuff is also put into chronological order as well.<br />A couple of minor things I would have liked to see<BR>1) The 'Classic Boxed' Packaging (mentioned above)<BR>2) An Interviews CD.   The book does a great job at giving you insight into the band members, but there would have been nothing like having the actual voice<BR>3) Unedited Stuff - perhaps there wasn't much saved, but I'm sure there had to be some unedited stuff to add to this.<br />But these are extremely minor points - the best thing is that this Boxed Set really delivers as advertised.   Whether you are a beginner to the Police or a more seasoned fan, this collection should not disappoint.
B00005JM02|4.0|I thought Finding Nemo was very cute, but it didn't hold my 1 1/2 year old's attention very well, which is who I bought the DVD for in the first place.  The graphics are fantastic, and the plot line very good.  Perhaps he'll like it more once he's a little older!
B0001AVZA8|3.0|I don't know if it's fair to call this movie a chick flick. It can be considered so every bit as much as Mel Gibson's \\"What Women Want\\": it is a chick flick with a twist, where the chauvinistic \\"highly coveted\\" bachelor is redempted from his world... well, sorta!<br />The movie is quite predictable: there are some sex scenes; romantic moments with french music, wine and the beach, and tales of heartbreak and reconciliation. For such a repeated plot, you probably wouldn't give the movie too much credit, but except for a few moments, the movie is actually saved by the performances of the two leads, mostly Diane Keaton, who played a brilliant part that will make you laugh real hard.<br />I don't think it's \\"the worse movie ever\\" or some other categorizations it's received like that, but there are far better movies (and stories) out there (if you want to dig into the theme, do pick up the Gibson flick I mentioned earlier -you're bound to like it even more). Overall, I give it 3.5 stars.
B0001Z363W|5.0|Er, hello? Anybody home? The name of this record is 'HANGOVER MUSIC'. Not 'Music To Go Crazy And Break Stuff To' or 'Monster Riffs From Hell'. Jesus, how ignorant can people be? Did all you people complaining about this album not read any press or bother to go over to his website before this was released? Or when you were handing over your cash did you not even stop to think what an album entitled 'HANGOVER MUSIC' might contain? Er, how about music that you'd like to play when you're hungover?.....<br />Anyway... Quite simply I think this album is fantastic and as much as I love Zakk's previous work I think he has written something incredibley special here. I just can't over the huge leap Zakk has made with this album. His songwriting, lyrics, vocals and solos have all improved with this release and I for one have an even greater respect for the man.<br />Everything is here. Although there are a lot of acoustic guitars and pianos there are still lots of electric riffs and out of this world solos. I cannot possibly see how ANYONE who likes Book of Shadows cannot fall in love with this album. I appreciate that everyone hears music differently but, to my ears at least, this album is something very special indeed. It's certainly darker than BoS but I see this as a wonderful thing! <br />I love the fact that he isn't singing &quot;oh mama&quot; in every song and that he's dealing with a lot of dark stuff. Also, seemingly out of nowhere his solos have suddenly gained something which they've sometimes lacked in the past; feeling. There's even a section during the 'Layne' song that sounds a bit 'trippy'. <br />I've always had a tremendous respect for him as a guitarist and riff writer but now I can say that I also have the same amount of respect for him as a songwriter. I'm not saying that he hasn't written good songs in the past (which he has) but what I'm trying to say is that he's never written a single collection of songs as good as this. Steppin Stone, Damage is Done,Crazy or High, House of Doom, Fear etc etc. They're ALL amazing.<br />Next time someone tells you Zakk can't write good songs, give them this.
B0000DZEA1|4.0|The Howard Shore score to the last part of the LOTR trilogy contains plenty of magical moments that bring back instants of the brilliant movie to mind, and definitely accentuate the moments they accompany throughout it. But it felt the same way as the score to \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\"... there wasn't the same level of flow or coherence in it that I felt in \\"The Two Towers\\". More simply put, the total didn't feel as great as the sum of the parts or as coherent a piece of work as the score to the second movie. Some of the songs, though (in particular, toward the end, and most of all Annie Lennox's \\"Into The West\\"), were truly brilliant and inspiring. As a result I give it four stars: very good, but not the best it could have been.
B00000JQFM|5.0|The entire CD isn't seeing how fast one can play and how much you can bend the whammy bar. A perfect example is 'Always With Me, Always With You.' This song is melodic. Of course there are it's faster parts, but even those parts are melodic. The tapping part around 2:00 is an example. There are a few songs in which I think yes, all they are about is the speed, but it's by no means a coaster.
B000003TA4|5.0|No, I don't think Nirvana is the best rock band ever but Nevermind proved they defintely had talent.  So everyone on these reviews that somehow thinks MTV is force feeding us rock like Nirvana is smokin weed because last time I checked I didn't see ANY band even like Nirvana on MTV. Yeah, MTV did ruin rock but they didn't do it by playing Nirvana. And what's with everyone saying Nirvana was hate rock? Isn't all rock rebillious and hating some people for some reason? I want somebody to name a rock band that's never used the word hate or implied hate.  So if you have no idea what your talking about then I wouldn't talk about Nirvana like it was the worst rock band ever and it influenced &quot;hate rock.&quot;  Anyways for all of you that do know what your talking about Nevermind is one of the best CD's to ever come out, period.  If you don't have it, get it.
B000092ZYX|5.0|An interesting change again.  This as much (as people think it does) does not sound like the earlier radiohead albums.  It is a continuation of Amnesiacs direction.  Moving into what feels like rock but doesn't sound like most other rock.  As a whole the album is as complete as any of the Radiohead cds, but it may take more listens than earlier ones to truely appreciate.<br />Noteable songs include: all of them<br />I'd also like to commend the 10 or so people who recommended &quot;Sigur Ros - ()&quot; to go with this cd.  Samskeyti (track 3) is one of my favourites.
B0001Z363W|3.0|BLS is one of my favorite bands, Zakk is without question of of the greatest guitarists to ever live. Although this is not the best BLS album, it's still certainly enjoyable. This is more of a 3 1/2 out of 5 star album than a 3, I don't want to be hard on this album. While I enjoy Zakk's voice and his acoustic tunes, I took of one star because, while the 1st 3 tunes kick major ass and are downbeat and depressing, the rest of the album is more upbeat brings to mind a ho-down in rural Arkansas. They're not bad at all, I just enjoy the downbeat, mellower acoustic work. And I took off another star (or half star) because BLS is modern rocks most straight foward band. We now have to wait another year for a kick ass BLS album. But overall, good effort by Zakk, showing how versatile he really is.
B000002TQV|5.0|A twisted love song.  Though the album is not really about love, more about people.  What makes us hold on, deny, stop believing, kill. Its all there.  A pychological journey which may be too real for some listeners, The Bend contains some of the best rock of the 90s.  Songs like Fake Plastic Trees, The Bends, Just, High and Dry all brought out a new type of rock that wasn't about mindless strumming but carefully perfected tunes.  With the soaring guitars of floyd and the melodic diversity of the beatles, The Bends is a true classic.  Do not be put off by the lyrics when you first listen, this album is about the music.
B0001ENY6M|5.0|It is fitting that a movie so amazing and wonderful be accompanied by music equally astonishing.  Every single track transforms you to a higher level. I especially loved the \\"Azeri\\" track featured in the cd performed by The Goksel Baktagir and Yurdal Tokcan. The soundtrack is a classic and should be part of collection of every self-respecting music lover.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|the diverse range of tracks make for an awesome album.  If you were to hear the whole LP, you would never think that it was the same guys throughout the album, and thier diversity makes for an exciting album
B000003TA4|5.0|Despite what a few of the ignorant may say, this is a legendary punk-rock album.  Kurt Cobain was a brilliant songwriter and lyric writer.  Maybe Kurt wasnt an increadible guitar player. But that is not the point.  Kurt knew how to put songs together perfectly with a perfect melody behind the music.  So yeah most nirvana songs are easy to play..so what.  Where does it say that a song has to be difficult to be a great song?  Some of the most remembered famous rock, pop, country, you name it songs are not hard to play.  But that was just the thing about kurt cobain.  He would play the same four chords as everyone else but he could nail the perfect vocal melody over those chords better than anyone.  I think shredding and going off on an insane guitar solo is awesome.  But I'm also open-minded enough to know that you do not have to be able to do that in order to be a good musicain.  So you can make your own self-proclaimed comments(meaning comments that you have nothing to back up with other than it's your own stupid opinion) but just keep in mind that it's all music and not every guitarist has to be eddie van halen.  if you had never heard &quot;Come as you are&quot; before and i played the riff for you and told you to make up a melody for it you would not have come up with the same great melody line that Kurt Cobain came up with for it i guaruntee you that.  It would have been something different and not as good or clever.  Dont be narrow-minded and look at Kurt for what he was..a brilliant songwriter.  Nevermind is a record full of well put toghether material.
B000060P79|1.0|they are the worst emo-poser band ever.  all the chords to every song are the same.. they JUST SUCK BALLS
B00018D44U|1.0|im not going to write a lot because, looking through the reviews, i see that many are negative. i just want to point out that this is not music. talking sexily and playing piano one key at a time does not make a song, an album, or a musical masterpiece. norah is probably the sexiest TALKER that i have ever heard but that does not mean she should get a record contract and brainwash people into thinking her \\"music\\" is calm and refreshing. its not music. even worse, its not music and its boring. i am astounded. i thought making albums was saved for the musically talented. i guess i was wrong
0375414053|3.0|As a working mom, I had to pick up this book. It wasn't a waste of time. It was entertaining, both funny and sad. But the end left me very troubled. (Caution: as in some other reviews, this contains a spoiler.)<br />No, I couldn't completely relate to Kate's life. We aren't that rich, and my job isn't nearly as demanding (thank goodness!). But there was a lot there that I could understand -- knowing that your husband would not even think to read a note from school, weighing what to say to your childcare help because that person is very valuable and you don't want to cause trouble, dealing with household horrors like rotting fruit and rodents because you just can't stay on top of the housework and nobody else is doing it for you, making lists that carry over the same items day after day because there aren't enough hours to accomplish everything. (Actually, I'd guess that most of these things are problems for at-home moms, too.)<br />Yes, Kate could be frustrating, but who really has it all together? Kate was a workaholic and needed to be more honest and assertive -- at her office, with her household help, with her husband. She needed to take control of her life, which was obviously falling apart -- she drank too much, spent too much, flirted too much. Those of us who lack Kate's material comforts may feel that she was a whiner, but in the end, let the person with their act completely together cast the first stone. I found Kate's messy life refreshingly real.<br />What troubled me though, and why I gave the book three stars, was the end. Kate's only way out was to quit her job (though she seemed to be on the way to creating a new one in the epilogue). Likewise, her two best friends were unable to make life work as full-time working mothers: one quit her job and started an at-home business, the other lost her husband and went part-time. Allison Pearson seems to believe strongly that you just can't be a mother and work full-time. Maybe she's right. The work world is mighty tough on mothers. But I'm an optimist, I guess, and Pearson's answer depressed me. Maybe I just can't accept reality.
B00023BKMM|5.0|Although it is quite a slow film, i really enjoyed it. You have to watch it all the way through to understand it, and there is nothing scary about it even in parts there's that abit of a scare for some people. It does involve a couple of the same people over and over again and there arn't a lot of people in the film either. I won't tell you what the story is about, or i might ruin it for you. A FIRST SUSPICION FILM, THAT KIND OF CARRIES ON THROUGHOUT THE FILM. not everyone's type though.
B00006L83N|5.0|That is exactly what Symphony X has done here.  Odyssey has some of their most raw material yet, not to mention the most well writen.  The album opens up with Inferno which is a rather catchy track but after listening to it several times you also discover how great it is aside from being catchy.  Wicked is an isnteresting piece too, it's slightly different then the others but also a little harder it explain why.  It does have a great story to it about a traveller however that is very intreyging.  Incarntations Of the Apprentice also is a little different, it has room for more vocals in the verses making it unique in it's own respect.  <br />Accolade II, this is one of the best pieces on the album, it takes off where Accolade left off but has the power of all the other songs but also holds it's own beauty.  King of Terrors is one of the heavier tracks but it's is still excellently exicuted.  The Turning is Turning is also a heavy track with great guitar work by Romeo, the outro to it with the Keyboard and guitar is worth a listen to as well.  Awakenings is a song that could have fit nicely on V but it certainly has it's place on Odyssey.  A good time of 8 mins. and very beautiful as well, much like that of Accolade II.<br />The Odyssey, this is the monster track.  24 mins. long and never a dull moment.  The symphonic work at the beginning is masterful and the song as a whole is emense!  The story of the Odyssey is nicely portraided with instrumental parts throughout the whole piece.  <br />This album is another masterpiece by Symphony X, one of the greatest prog metal bands around.  Any fan should own a copy.
0399226907|1.0|This book has to be one of the greatest sagas ever told, the story of a caterpillar who eats his way to becoming a beautiful butterfly. I think it's a story we can all relate to.<br />I'm going to give it one star anyway because I just stubbed my toe really hard and damn it, I blame this book.
B0000AXE8I|2.0|Alright, let me just get this out of the way first: There were two good thing about this movie, the special effects and the fight scenes.<BR>Now back to reality. I loved the first movie of this trilogy, and Reloded ruined it for me. This movie digs way too deep into personal lives and gets too philosophical for a high-tech action movie. There are things like an insanely long sex scene, and family arguments that just ruin the coolness of the movie. The movie is no longer about getting the bad guys while wearing long, black trenchcoats chalk-full of machine guns. Instead, its about Zion (the only city left on Earth that hasn't been corrupted by the Matrix) and the emotional issues of the people living in it. And don't forget the way overplayed romance between Neo and Trinity. Now don't get me wrong, I don't mind a love story in an action movie, but it should not be the focus. Essentially, Reloaded gets way off track from what the viewer wants: to see those bloody computers get their butts kicked. I am not even going to see Revolutions, the last in the trilogy, because I've heard it's even worse.<BR>I only have one thing left to do before I'm done with the Matrix series completely: Watch the first one again, so I can remember it as it deserves to be remembered, not the way I think about Reloaded.
B000002UAX|5.0|How can one say that?  Unlike Sgt. Pepper, the White Album actually featured the Beatles as a GROUP, unlike Peppers in which they sort of acted as studio musicians for each other.  An actual chemistry is felt as they once again redefine the boundaries of popular music.  An amazing album, and nearly every song is legendary.
B0001N1RU8|5.0|You often quote album reviews from the All-Music Guide. Please do so for this album: their review says everything I was trying to say as I sat here writing and re-writing my own, far better than I can do. And it should be required reading for anyone here who gave this less than five stars... AMG has really nailed it with this disc, folks!!
B00001PE4D|5.0|We'll start with the bad, for those who have seen dangerous liasons you've seen it all before and will expect similiar. Don't!<BR>This is vamped for the younger generation. The only other thing that may make you dislike this film is Philipe's &quot;Sebastian&quot; acting. His acting through parts of the film is seemably someone trying to act but his character is someone who is constantly lying and is pretending. Several parts of the film when his emotions come out his acting is bottled. It's probably how most guys would act in the real situation trying to keep a tap on their emotions and the only flaw in this is that it's too real and not more like what we usually see on screen.<BR>But despite that this is a brilliant film with twists and a great ending. <br />I'd like to mention the excellent job Edward Shearmur did for the soundtrack. Brilliant non intrusive to the movie and very suiting to the mood. Each and every track melds into a great viewable movie.<br />With only a thousand characters per comment I could go on all day about film but thought more suiting to mention the bad and let you enjoy the movie with these out of the way.<BR>One of my all time favourite's.
B000000LZV|5.0|This album stands alone as the most innovative, independent, truly spirited records made.  It's interesting to hear reviews from younger folks as they try and disseminate this album and compare it to their &#34;vast&#34; knowledge of what they consider punk. Punk, as most of us here know, doesn't exist anymore, in either music or spirit.  It came and went.  Let's have no more present tense talk about it.  Just put this one on the turntable, sit back and listen to 1984......car engines and all.
0739310097|4.0|Ever since I devoured &quot;Shopaholic&quot;, I was awash with anticipation for another peek into Sophie's mind.   Emma and Becky are strong women who know what they want...and they drag us with them trying to find it!  I cannot wait for &quot;Secret&quot; to come out on audio tape!  These stories are the only things that make a long, solitary drive tolerable.  Way to go Sophie!  Looking forward to a great deal more from you!
1594200106|5.0|This novel apparently was a number one best seller in Spain for over a year when published in it's original Spanish. It is now available in a translated English language edition. The book is a marvelous page-turner with a wonderful plot that is made up of many elements. It's a coming of age story, a thriller, a love story, a lose of love story, of father's and daughters, of friends in youth, of friends in envy, and full of dark secrets and lies. Daniel's father, who runs a used bookstore, takes Daniel to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books and asks Daniel to, chose one. Daniel's choice (a book titled THE SHADOW OF THE WIND) changes his whole life as he searches to find other books by the same author. Why is someone buying and burning this author's books?  Daniel sets out to discover the reason and in the process discovers and endless stream of characters whom all hold a piece of the puzzle. The Novel is extremely well written, such as this example: \\"....says that the art of reading is slowly dying, that it's an intimate ritual, that a book is a mirror that offers us only what we already carry inside us, that when we read, we do it with all out heart and mind, and great readers are becoming more scarce by the day. Every month we receive offers to turn our bookshop into a store selling televisions, girdles, or rope-soled shoes. They won't get us out of here unless it's feet first.\\"<br />Similar to the way the exceptional narrator in the novel THE CRIMSON PETAL AND THE WHITE takes you out into the streets of London, Daniel's first person account here takes you along with him into the streets of  Barcelona... to find out who wrote and who wants to burn the last remaining copy of the \\"Shadow of the Wind\\". I guarantee you will enjoy this seductive read.
B00005JMEW|4.0|Kill Bill vol. 1 is probably the perfect 4th film by trash-guru Tarantino after a shoddy attempt with Jackie Brown. While some thought he was out of Hollywood forever, the immense creativity and breakneck speed of this film is a breath of fresh air. There is more than enough blood and guts to satisfy pure action fans, well choreographed fight scenes for &quot;martial art film&quot; fans, and excellent storylines for fans of his particular scripting craft. It's also the most artistic mainstream release since Natural Born Killers.<br />I'll give this DVD 4 stars just for the lack of extras - just wait for the collector's edition - and that the final battle scene with Iishi is way too anti-climactic to be included dead last in this rollercoaster of a movie.
B00006RU5B|5.0|THIS WAS WITHOUT ANY DOUBT THE GREATEST RELEASE OF 2002 FROM THIS GREAT BAND FEATURING THE EX MEMBERS OF SOUNDGARDEN AND RATM.THIS CD IS ONE OF MY FAVOURITES AND FEATURING SMOLDERING CLASSICS LIKE GASOLINE,COCHISE,LIKE A STONE FEATURING AWESOME GUITAR WORK FROM THE GIFTED TOM MORELLO WITH GREAT VOCALS FROM CHRIS CORNELL.VERY VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B0001UZZWW|4.0|Shrek is a fun movie that pokes fun at other fairytales while being a fairytale itself. It's about a Ogar named Shrek (Voiced by Mike Myers) who rescues a Princess (Cameron Diaz) from a dragon. She was expecting a handsome prince but she....gets Shrek. Along with his wisecracking Donkey (Eddie Murphy) he's supposed to deliver the Princess to Lord Farquard (John Lithgow) so he can get married and be King. Anyway along the way Shrek falls for the Princess and is afraid that she could never love a Ogar. The script gives us a clever twist where she's cursed and becomes Ogar at night time. Shrek doesn't know this though.<br />  Many call Shrek too vulgar but it's not that bad compared to other movies these days that are so called family films. It has a heart, it's funny and the voice acting is great. The short 3-D ride/movie from Universal Studios is just as entertaining and it's cool that it's being released on dvd. Anyway it starts off where the movie ended. Shrek and Princess Fiona are happily married and are on their honey moon. Lord Farquard comes back as a ghost looking for revenge. I wish they sold it alone though since I already own Shrek by itself.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I suppose we could weep about it, I sure did. But the fact of the matter is there's always going to be really stupid things that make it easy and utterly brilliant things that do it tough. <br />Firefly is one of those gems in television that hooks you, makes you actually care about each character and each story in every episode. The show is full of charm, drama, action, tenderness and an amazing wit. You love it so much its a sad feeling when you finish watching the last episode on this DVD!<br />But just because it was cancelled doesn't nescessarily mean it won't be back. The movie will eventually come out and hopefully get it back on the air (if that's the direction Joss Whedon wants to go).<br />Definitely buy this because if you don't you're missing out on something incredibly special, I think the amount of 5 star reviews for it on Amazon speaks for itself.
B000092T6M|4.0|This is a really terrific movie, if you can ignore Kevin Costner's bad accent (why isn't it an English accent? Cos he was so bad!) and mullet hairstyle - yuck! Every aspect of the movie has to be given top marks, and on this special edition of the movie, you get 12 minutes of extra footage that wasn't shown originally in cinemas.<br />However, the rest of the extras are not very good. I don't see the point in bringing out films that did great business when they originally came out, but don't give much extra on the DVD! The only decent extra on this is Bryan Adam's live performance at Slane Castle in Dublin of &quot;Everything I Do (I Do It For You)&quot;. You've got a &quot;behind the scenes&quot; feature - presented strangely enough by Pierce Brosnan (why?) playing Jeff Goldblum. (The resemblance is uncanny). And then there are &quot;vintage&quot; cast interviews, which I can't stand on DVD extras - they are so dull &amp; tedious! And a photo gallery, you can't forget that.<br />The 12 minutes not shown in cinemas is quite cool. But you have to watch closely, because sometimes, it's little more than extra shots of people in the crowd or whatever. What is quite good, is the longer sections of cut film is to do with the Sheriff of Nottingham, and these scenes give an insight into his relationship with the witch. Very interesting, and so stupid that it was cut from the original version of the film.<br />There's a great cameo from Sean Connery towards the end (why did I think Patrick Stewart was going to walk out?), which he reportedly got paid $250,000 for, for TWO DAYS work (alright for some) which he donated to charity.<br />For all the ladies out there - the scene where Kevin Costner is naked under the waterfall, is actually a body double!!! Which is kinda weird, have you seen the tan lines?!<br />This is a DVD to get purely for the 12 minutes extra, not for the rest of the extras. But otherwise, the film is great, and the score by Michael Kamen is so sad at times.

B00004WEJZ|2.0|From coming from a Big Bond fan. I live and breath Bond Movies. This would (NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN) bring all Bond movies to shame, luckily, this movie isn't considered a Bond Movie.<BR>It's a remake, mistake, of Sean Connery's Thunderball.<BR>Sean Connery, being one of my favorite Bonds ever, and mostly everyone elses, would have to agree how bad they made him look on here as Bond.<BR>The movie is cheap, and boring, hardly any action to a normal Bond Movie (DR. No-Die Another Day).<BR>Not worth getting, or even watching in any case.<BR>Save yourself time, don't watch this one, it's not considered a Bond Movie... Wonder why....NEVER WATCH NEVER AGAIN.
B0001AVZA8|4.0|&quot;Something's Gotta Give&quot; was a movie I know I will watch over and over again -- okay, that's just the way I am when a movie appeals to me. I thought it was a wonderful satire of contemporary society, which consistently values youth over age. I have to admire Jack Nicholson for taking on a role that reminds the viewer of the actor's own very public relationships with much younger women. And Nicholson did an excellent turn as a man reluctant, at age 60+, to grow up and assume the adult role. Diane Keaton as 'Erica' was outstanding -- she did not indulge in most of her trademark mannerisms &amp; because of that her character seemed very real and vivid, much more so than that of her daughter (played by the competent Amanda Peet). As to the May-September romance between 'Erica' and the much younger doctor (played by Keanu Reeves), which bothered many viewers: I did not feel comfortable with it either...it seemed perhaps to be too much of a wish-fullfillment..as a light flirtation or a fling I could see it, but I think it was unrealistic that 'Erica' would even consider marriage to the much younger doctor, let alone become engaged to him.<br />For me, the highlight of the movie was the speech that Frances McDormand made early in the movie, relating how women in their 50s were &quot;the most %$#@%^ generation of America women ever.&quot; Since I didn't see it in the theatre, I can only imagine the cheers that went up when she was finished! And speaking of Ms McDormand, I would loved to have seen more of her character -- she just disappeared from the movie without any reason given, which was IMO a waste of her talent.<br />As to the DVD, I wish there were more bonus materials -- I rarely listen to audio commentary, and,other than that, there isn't much more than a deleted scene and a tour of the house where much of the movie took place. Ho hum!
0385512104|5.0|It's been years since I've read through a novel in essentially one sitting. That's how absorbing this one is. I heard excerpts from the novel read on BBC Radio before I read the book and I was sold. The novel is amazing, not just because of the convincing way the author assumes the voice of the protagonist, a 15-year-old autistic from Swindon named Christopher, but because of the humanity he endows all of the characters with, from the seriously troubled father to the multitude of confused and harried police officers that Christopher interacts with. Like others here, I was also struck and mesmerized by the excursions into other parts of Christopher's mind, particularly the parts that are genius at math and science. This novel is much more than the sum of its parts. It can be read as (not limited to but including) a detective story, a Bildungsroman, a tale of family conflict, and a meditation on memory, socialization, and information, all in one. The tone is never one of bathos -- you feel Christopher's pain and confusion, and you are caught up in his plight, but you never feel manipulated to pity him. Absolutely brilliant.
B0000TB01Y|3.0|It saddens me that a novel so archly opinionated and political would be simplified into a story about a pretty girl and an ugly girl. Because if there was ever a time for a smart play about a Wizard who tricked his way into ruling a nation, and a friendship destroyed over whether to fight or be docile, this would be it. The writers could have been on the bleeding edge of political theater! But no, a Broadway musical these days needs to make money and provide escape from reality, and it seems as if Assassins has politics cornered this season. There is some good music, and \\"Defying Gravity\\" actually provides some good character insight, but the Wizard is de-Hitlerfied, the tragedy is not as severe, the sex is cleaned up, and Glinda takes center stage a bit too often in Elphaba's story.<br />Maguire's Oz is a hard place to live in, a world of magic and fantasy where those things did little to eleviate the troubling political, social, and even meteorological conditions; the shoes could help Nessarose stand on her own two feet, but not save her from a cruelly displaced house. We are forced into admitting that sometimes \\"evil\\" is the only acceptable course of action, after having it precipitated upon us. On stage, Oz appears to be more supportive of outcasts, the politics more annoying than outrageous, and wickedness manageable for children 8 and up.
B00015YVDG|2.0|ENOUGH with the &quot;cat and mouse&quot; expression! Anyway, this is another &quot;Hollywood&quot; movie. Very unrealistic, many times during the movie you will be thinking &quot;that would NEVER happen&quot;. The beginning of the movie we see dad and son play around, laugh, and and have fun, as if that is a typical every day for them. (Who hasn't seen that 20 times before?)<br />This DVD was given a special edition, but I am unsure why. The featurette is boring, 3/4 of it are clips we've just seen from the movie.<br />Overall, sure it's mildly entertaining if you can ignore how unbelievable it is.
0156027321|5.0|If you've read any of the other review you probably have an idea what the plot of this book is what I want to comment on is the books meaning. Throughout the story one central question seems to continually reappear. The question is which story do you believe? The creative wild story told in detail or the fathomable reasonable story told in short.  Those who believe in the less likely story may represent those who have faith, who are able to believe in something even if there is no concreate evidence that Pi was stranded with a Bengal Tiger.  Those who believe in the second story may represent the agnostics who Pi says he cannot stand because to the end they never have the guts to take a leap of faith and belive the unimaginable.
0060555661|5.0|this is buffets' bible for good reason. <br />the book's central concept, the margin of safety, is reinforced time and again w/ supporting ratios and working examples, both from the 60-70s and from zweig's excellent supplements (an extremely valuable supplement to the original text, if for no other reason than to show that graham's teachings are timeless). while occasionally ratios will appear dated and no longer relevant (i.e. book value's importance has declined w/ the transition of the US eq mkt to increasing intellectual capital in a company's mkt cap), its discipline, focus and litmus tests (i.e. bond yields vs E/P ratios) still remain valid.<br />for the individual investor, there simply is no better book.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|In my opinion, 'Lost in Translation' was a movie that will be difficult for me to forget, due to the acting of Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson. This movie is the best work that the vastly underrated Mr Murray has done since &quot;Groundhog's Day,&quot; and I feel that Ms Johansson has a brilliant career ahead of her. True, in some ways this is a movie &quot;Seinfeld,&quot; a movie about nothing: two lonely people meet in a foreign city where neither of them speaks the language, both of them are having problems within their respective marriages. Murray's marriage is obviously in trouble, and Johansson's is eventually going to need CPR. They spend some time together, nothing really seems to happen, except that it becomes clear to the viewer that they are indeed that overworked word: &quot;soulmates.&quot;<br />Sophia Cappola wisely resisted the temptation to allow these two to consumate their relationship, which would have changed the entire dynamic of the film. When they finally fell onto a bed, they ended up sleeping, with Murray tenderly holding Johansson's foot. To sleep in the presence of another person, and in this case someone you hardly know, is a brave act, an act of trust (thank you, Dianah Gabaldon, for pointing this fact out in your wonderful book &quot;Outlander,&quot; which is also the story of two soulmates). At the end of the film, Murray's character seems to have awakened from a long sleep, which is a life where he has spent years just going through the motions. What will happen to the character when he leaves Japan is pure conjecture on the part of the viewer: I like to think he went home and told his wife that they needed to put their marriage on the right track, and was willing to live with the consequences if she failed to understand him.<br />I also particularly enjoyed the sequence at the beginning of the movie where Murray, looking like a burnt-out case, was filming the liquor commercial. A once big action star, his career had fallen so low that he was reduced to making commercials abroad. That he had virtually checked out of his life was evident, reinforced by him fleeing the hotel bar when he was recognized by two American fans. IMO it is a shame that Murray did not win an Oscar for this subtle performance. Ms Johansson turned in an intelligent performance of an intelligent young woman who seemed to have married too soon, and to someone who did not appear to be her intellectual equal, a young man superficial enough to be dazzled by a pretty air-head. It is difficult for me to believe that she was not nominated for an Oscar for either 'Lost in Translation' or 'The Girl with the Pearl Earring.' I am confident her day will come!w that he was reduced to making commercials abroad.

B000084T18|5.0|Well this CD is awsome! I love the way 50 goes with the beats! Let me give ya my ratings.<br />Track 1- What Up Gangsta- This song is awsome. 50 Cent goes good with the beats, and its a good way too open the Album! I give this track a tight 9/10!<br />Track 2- Patiently Waiting &quot;Featuring Eminem&quot;- A Good song! I love it. Eminem really adds good too this song. 50 Cent starts it off, and it goes to Eminem, and it goes too 50. Awsome song, I do think Eminem does a bit better than 50 Cent in this song! I give this song a whopping 10/10!<br />Track 3- Many Men- This song should have had a bit better lyrical blast in it. 50 aint ill in this song, but he is just right. This song makes you think about 50 Cents past. He did get shot, and he did survive. God was on his side. I would give this song a 8/10!<br />Track 4- In Da Club- His best work on the album. A Fast pace song, and I love it. After it has been out for a year now, its gettin kinda old! lol. I do enjoy the song, but like every other song, you get tired of listening too it once you have heard it over 70 times in your life. LOL! I love the song, this gets a 10/10! &quot;Best Song on Album, that has a good beat, and good lyrics.&quot;<br />Track 5- High All The Time- Umm.. I dont know what 50 was thinking on this song. I dont like it too well. Definitly not his best work. He has much more lyrical progress to do on this song. He should have redone the song, or atleast changed the tone or lyrics. Overall, I give this song a 6/10!. &quot;Definitly not the best song on the album.&quot;<br />Track 6- Heat- Heat, nice song, good lyrics! Good action! &quot;I AINT PLAYIN!! HERE WHAT IM SAYING... HOMIE I AINT PLAYIN&quot; I love that part in that song. Its very good, and probably the second or third best song on the album. 10/10!<br />Track 7- If I Cant- Not too bad of a song.. it could be a bit better. 50 Cent here should have brought better lyrics into the song. It probably could have made a top seller for the Album, if he would have done a couple of parts over. 7/10!<br />Track 8- Blood Hound &quot;Featuring Young Buck&quot;- Ummm... has no place on the album. Not the best work. NOWAY! Belongs on a SHADY INVASION Album. Aint too good. I do enjoy the beat. Im feelin 50 in the song.. but its just not a good song for the album. 6/10!<br />Track 9- Back Down- This song... IS AWSOME! I love it. BACKDOWN! Good song, makes the Album worth buying along with In Da Club, and HEAT! This song deserves a whoppin 9/10!<br />Track 10- P.I.M.P- I like this song, but 50 dont do well by himself in it. I like the music video better. Snoop Dogg, and G-Unit. This song needs them in it. Snoop has the best verse in the whole song I believe. Not too bad of a song on the album, too bad it wasnt the remix. I give this song a 7/10!<br />Track 11- Like My Style &quot;Featuring Tony Yayo&quot;- Noway, this song aint good at all. The Worst Song on the album! Its probably on the album just too mess around, or throw something too finish up the album. I dont like the song too well.. but you all might. 3/10! &quot;THE WORST SONG ON THE ALBUM!&quot;<br />Track 12- Poor Lil Rich- This song is not that good. Not his best work. Nice beat, but bad lyrics. I dont like it too much. I give it a 5/10!<br />Track 13- 21 Questions &quot;Featuring Nate Dogg&quot;- One dang good song! 50 cent some of his good lyrical expression in this song. I do think this song reminds me of what a guy would ask a girl. Very good song. I give it a 9/10!<br />Track 14- Dont Push Me &quot;Featuring Eminem and Lloyd Banks&quot; Pretty tight song, I do think its the best duet on the song. Lloyd Banks is pretty tight in the song, though he isint as good as 50 Cent. Eminem needs a little work in this song. I do think 50 Cent has the best verse in this song. I give the song 8/10!<br />Track 15- Gotta Make It To Heaven- Nope.. this song aint too good on the album. 50 seems to be in a struggle. He believes in God, but his foul mouth and dirtydeeds are making him go to the bad place! ha ha! Good lyrics, bad beat! 6/10!<br />=====Bonus Tracks======<br />Wanksta- Good Song, I like it. Its just right, not too bad, I think its one of the best tracks on the Album! I love it. I would buy the Album for this song. He is nearly ill in the song. I give 50 Cent a whoppin.. 10/10!<br />U Not Like Me- This was on 50 Cents first album! Thats awsome. I do like the song, but I do not believe its his best. Pretty much a filler. But not at all bad. I give it a 6/10!<br />Lifes On The Line- Too much beat too it. I dont like it too well. He aint loud enough in the song. Well I would give this song a 7/10!<br />Overall- I would give this album a 9/10! Some flaws in songs, minor errors in lyrical explanation, and lyrical moods. 50 Cent has his best work yet in this album. Songs to listen too when you buy it.<br />1.What Up Gangsta<BR>2.Patiently Waiting<BR>3.In Da Club<BR>4.Heat<BR>5.21 Questions<BR>6.Dont Push Me<BR>7.Wanksta<br />50 Cents new album will be in stores soon!

B00009L1TA|4.0|BASIC is one frustrating movie...I found myself wondering throughout the whole movie, what in the world is going on here?  Who in the world is telling the truth?  Who killed who?  But, once it completes its rollercoaster ride, it leaves you snickering, come on, how can this be? And yet, I found myself riveted to the screen waiting for the \\"truth\\" to be told.  John Travolta is at his smooth best in the role of an interrogator under investigation for bribery; Timothy Daly gives a good performance as his old buddy who lures him into the case; Connie Nielsen is pretty, but her performance is at times too wooden to be convincing; Brian van Holt is excellent as Ray, the stubborn soldier; Giovanni Ribisi (so good in \\"The Gift\\") is a little too \\"gay\\" in his role, but convincing; Samuel L. Jackson is Samuel L. Jackson, but certainly makes you hate him.  John McTiernan's direction (he of the Die Hard fame) is crisp and shrouded in mystery.  If you have a low frustration level, you may give up on \\"Basic\\"; but stick with it; it's ending comes out of nowhere, but it does have an impact.

B000000W6R|5.0|Hello,... This album is gold for all rock loving teens, it does not matter if you are a pumpkinhead or not, this album is a sure thing. Lets kick off with an opener Soothe...soothe, gentle, acoustic and sad, a great start to the album. Then we have frail and Bedazzeled, which gets us rocking, great song. Plume comes in number 3, but I can not realy make up my mind about it, so lets leave it alone (interesting riff).If you like James Ihas Let it come down, you will just adore Whir (Billy sings, but sounds like an Iha song) Blew away features Iha on vocals, it is mostly an acoustic song, accept it gets siamese dream kind of guitar distortion at the end. I cant decide on the next one... Pissant...Hmmm...Lyrics were wriiten in 10 minutes and that shows, nad Pissant was recorded live, all in all a cool punk song (I gues). Hello kity kat folowes Pissant punk orientation, but with great riffs, pasive-agresive lyrics,and a funny title comes close to perfection, but the mix isnt as good, but a great song anyways. Obscured is on number 8, it should be on Lull, but was droped and put here...an old pumpkin song, from there first days...pure gold for pumpkinheds. Obscured is folowed by another acoustic song Landslide...what to say? Simply beautiful song. At door number 10, it is .... Starla!!! By my judgement the best song on the album, one of pumpkins best work. It goes on for 11 minutes and leaves you dazzeled at the end of a 5 min guitar solo. Next one is another old song from Lull, Blue... it has a great bass intro, and i love it, as i love Girl named Sandoz. There is something about this song that remindes me on John Spencers sound, it is diffrent and great. We are closing in on the album, it is not over yet. La dolly vita is another great song, that sounds, like Gish album songs, and Jimmy realy puts a alot of effort on it. After that there is a weird finnish to the album with Spaced, which is to weird to review. Well, friends it seems that this is it, buy the album,rock your house with it.... till next time... rock on<BR>                                                S.J.
B00005JMFQ|3.0|I did not have the opportunity to watch &quot;Love Actually&quot; in the theatre, but I read about it for months in the media and on internet message boards. It certainly did not live up to the standards of the classic &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral,&quot; but having bought the DVD, I know I will watch it again.<br />The biggest problems I had with the movie were 1)too many storylines and 2)some storylines were handled much better than others. The porn movie storyline and the Brit-vacationing-in- America were the two weakest and IMO should have never made it to the screen, as they weren't amusing or touching. The PM storyline was not in the least believable, but Hugh Grant did a wonderful job with a minimum of Grantisms. I was probably one of the few who was not enchanted with the Liam Neeson &amp; stepson storyline: I didn't think it was realistic that a little boy would be more upset about a little girl going back to America than with the death of his beloved mother. I also disliked the airport scene, where adults were encouraging this precocious child to dodge airline security. And just as an aside, I really have a pet peeve about movies that encourage pre-teens to display emotions that are more appropriate for older children or adults -- ugh!<br />The best storylines IMO were the ones involving Laura Linney, Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson, and Colin Firth. I hated that the Laura Linney character gave up her chance at happiness to play handmaiden to her mentally ill brother -- it seemed to me that she could &amp; should have had it all! The Rickman-Thompson storyline was the most realistic and therefore to me the most touching. At the end it seemed apparent to me that Ms Thompson's character was going to accomodate her husband's wandering eye in order to keep her family together -- old fashioned, perhaps, but not all that uncommon. Colin Firth's romance with the Portugese maid was touching and funny, especially the final proposal scene. But the honors IMO go to Bill Nigey, whose aging rock star kept the movie from being too sweet and cloying. His disgust with what he had become and the wasted years supporting his heroin addiction were handled masterfully.to Bill Nigey, whose aging rock star kept the movie from being too sweet and cloying.

B000002L7J|4.0|I think this album is really really good. A lot of the songs say things which are in my humble opinion critically important to humanity.<br />The song Meat Is Murder is powerful and frightening but also heartfelt, so I don't see why it is &quot;over-the-top&quot;. Whilst I do believe in freedom of choice, Morrissey's opinion is being put forward, I think, in the interests of reducing suffering.  Just because it is difficult to listen to doesn't make it over-the-top IMO. I don't normally make bold statements or submit reviews, but this was important to me.
B000089CJI|5.0|When I first read an article interviewing Jenny Lewis last summer I stumbled upon the mentioning of The Postal Service. It was an awesome thing to hear there was a group compilating an electronic source with the vocals of Death Cab's Ben Gibbard. Giving this I speedily sought out downloads of the tracks of &quot;Give Up&quot;.<br />  Now usually I test out albums by downloading them first, as do many people I'm sure, but this is one for the books and is surely one to own flat out. Whether it be vinyl,cd,tape or whatever, just make sure to have some copy form of this masterpiece. I mean it is one of those that is destined to be a classic. You know how you read those &quot;Essential Album&quot; lists in magazines? Well, This is going to be one of those that keep reoccuring on them.<br />  It's to be played whenever and doesn't isolate itself in a particular mood. Literally put it own at anytime and never get tired of it. It's upbeat and thoughtful. Bright and at some points dark. It involves, lyrically wise, much concern with love and common paranoia situations to the every day worldly abcedian. It's fresh approach is what sticks it to ya and you won't be sorry for giving it the time.
B000069HK2|5.0|I bought this CD nearly a year ago, and it has barely left my stereo since. The Used are incredible. Bert's screams and vocal range never cease to amaze me. Just listen to Noise and Kisses to see what I mean. Quinn Allman's guitar parts are very good and consistent, but I was a bit disappointed that there were so many purely chord based songs.

B000002U9W|5.0|\\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" and everything after it were huge hits for Pink Floyd, but though they were nothing like anything else being released at the time, it was no surprise that they were the phenomenal successes that they were. Their fifth effort \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" was their first Number 1 album, topping the album chart in the UK in October 1970 (in the US, where Floyd was still stuck with cult band status, its success was so-so). But this was certainly not the conventional form of a number-one album, even for England (one can compare this unlikely success to Jethro Tull's LP-length epic \\"Thick As a Brick,\\" which was another Number 1). \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" featured a nearly 25 minute-long opus that showcased the band at their thought-challenging, psychedelic best, backed by a mild orchestra conducted by \\"avante-garde\\" experimenter Ron Geesin. This winding suite is followed by three vintage Floyd classics and a fifteen-minute piece salute to breakfast. The twenty-minute long instrumental and subsequent four tracks found the four members out of breath, due to the fact that the band was in a hurry to get the project done under the pressures of a hectic touring schedule. And though it shows in the title song (but that's not a bad thing), the group was obviously exhausted; but if \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" is the output of a tired, drained Pink Floyd, then it was obvious that a focused Pink Floyd could not be stopped (later albums \\"Dark Side,\\" \\"Wish You Were Here,\\" and so on, were absolute proof).<br />The title suite itself stands with other Floyd epics 'A Saucerful of Secrets' and the later 'Echoes' as a marvel of the group's strong desire to enter new territory. But while 'Saucerful' was dark and mysterious and while 'Echoes' was full of tight, melodic-but-complex structures, the song 'Atom Heart Mother' itself is made up of six parts, each possessing their own weird qualities while still complementing the others. These parts travel through a range of moods, toying with the beautiful, the melancholy, and the erratic; David Gilmour's varied guitar lines can make one think while at the same time conjuring images of sadness and triumph, while Nick Mason shows off an interesting style with the drum parts he composed. The sounds of motorcycles and horses exemplify Pink Floyd's love of sound effects, and Geesin shows his hand in arranging the orchestra and bizarre background choirs singing nonsense.<br />When the song is finally over, 'If' is a perfect aftershock. A treaure in itself, the song is Roger Waters in a state one rarely finds him in; except for most of 1983's \\"The Final Cut,\\" it is Waters' most desperate, pleading song, almost apologetic for his confrontational cynicism and his later conflicts with his fellow bandmates.<br />Keyboardist Richard Wright scores with the gem 'Summer '68,' which finds Pink Floyd almost sounding a bit Beatle-esque (they would never sound that way again). The end line \\"I've had enough for one day\\" fully embodies Wright's melancholic vocal ability. Gilmour's 'Fat Old Sun' follows, and fits perfectly next to 'Summer '68'; it is the guitarist's reflection and yearning for childhood, something anyone can identify with, the pre-cursor to Floyd's 1994 song 'High Hopes.' Closing the album is a strange ode to Floyd roadie Alan Stiles, a three-section instrumental that applies to all the senses of morning rituals.<br />Except for maybe 'Summer '68,' this album is certainly not what one would expect in a Number 1 record. But this was one of the steps Pink Floyd took in changing the face of modern music--this band made it possible that music could be challenging and unusual, and still be successful, an ethic that bands should keep to this day.beautiful, the melancholy, and the erratic; David Gilmour's varied guitar lines can make one think while at the same time conjuring images of sadness and triumph, while Nick Mason shows off an interesting style with the drum parts he composed.

B0001ADAVK|3.0|I really wanted to like this movie much more than I did, although I think there were several inspired performances which raised the movie from ho-hum to somewhat better than average. The biggest problem with the movie was that it has been done before, and much better: \\"The Dead Poet's Society\\" and \\"The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie\\" are two movies that instantly leap to my mind. In my opinion, the movie emphasized the wrong characters: the young women played by Kristen Dunst and Julia Stiles were far less interesting than the Maggie Gyllenhaal and Juliet Stevenson characters (the Stevenson character left the movie far too early). The marriage vs career script was for the most part uninspiring and ho-hum. The characters, except for Gyllenhaal and Dunst, were pretty much divided up between all good and all bad; Dunst's mother was a stock villain who seemed straight out of that classic of the early 1960s, \\"A Summer Place.\\"<br />The outstanding performances of the movie were turned in by Julia Roberts and Marcia Gay Harden, playing women totally opposite from each other who became friends of sorts. Ms Harden did an excellent job of portraying a woman so scared of living that she would rather stay home to watch a game show on televison than go out for a night on the town with the friend who would soon be leaving forever. That scene neatly forshadowed the rest of the characer's life, hunkering down to protect herself from the world. Roberts performance was vastly underrated: it will be a long time before I forget how skillfully she portrayed the humiliation her character felt when tormented on her first day in the classroom by her students.<br />More bonus material on the DVD would have been welcome, but this seems to be getting to be fairly standard for regularly priced DVDs.

B000056NX5|3.0|I have been looking high and low for this DVD and I was exhilarated when I found it. I had to have it specially ordered because the store I went to did not have it in stock. And yes, it was worth it. <br />To those of you unfamiliar with the plot of Jesus Christ Superstar (JCS), well... that sounds quite implausible, but still... if you have no idea what the story of Jesus Christ is, all you have to do is read the Bible, or head out to watch Passion of the Christ. JCS chronicles the last few days, or perhaps hours of Jesus of Nazareth's life, through the point of view of the betrayer, Judas Iscariot. <br />Yes, this is what makes the storyline somewhat distinct from other movies/plays based on the story of Jesus. Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical sees Jesus through the eyes of Judas, and explores Judas's character, while at the same time, helping the audience to speculate why Judas would betray someone he loved so much. <br />The cast here is outstanding. Glenn Carter is superb as Jesus, partly because he bears some resemblance to his character. Renee Castle is a great singer, though her voice is a little feeble and is reminiscent of Brandy. Jerome Pradon gets the thumbs-up for his performance as Judas. His interpretation of Judas's character shows us a man who is torn between his love for Jesus and his wisdom. Although Jerome is hardly a great singer, he is an outstanding actor. And his great performance is what makes the film so enjoyable. Rik Mayall is wonderful as King Herod. He has the right mischievous air, coupled with the malice he exudes. <br />Indeed, it is the cast that holds this performance together. The musical itself, to me, is hardly as strong as what Andrew Lloyd Webber could have offered. The music has not enough lilts to engross viewers. I would not classify this musical as one of the greatest in the world for this reason. Such a great story deserves a stronger musical score to bring forth its greatness.

B00000HYXB|5.0|God, I love this band. This is my favorite band in the world. This album made this band shine like a sun. This album is dedicated to Tolkien, the one who wrote &quot;Lord Of The Rings&quot; saga. BG just summed one of his novels, &quot;The Silmarillon&quot;, in one musical CD. There are 22 tracks divided in 11 songs and 11 narrations. Let me go through the tracks and rate them.<br />1. War Of Wrath: Nice opening narration to this great album. At first you'll hear &quot;Cling Clang&quot; and they start with the talk. After the narration it connects with...<br />2. Into The Storm: Very fast beginning to this track. Great riffs, solo, and vocals. The bridge and the chorus really kicks in very brilliantly. Amazing track! 5/5<br />3. Lammoth: All you can hear on this track is HOOOOOOOOO! Pretty funny though.<br />4. Nightfall: Wow! A smooth and soft song. Really, this song gets you in the mood and you can imagine the Nightfall in your mind. A very good track. 5/5<br />5. The Minstrel: A flutey track with a little words sang. Sweet!<br />6. The Curse Of Feanor: This is a great song. Very heavy and melodic at the same time. The first chorus is amazing sang. Hansi's voice in this song is amazing. 5/5<br />7. Captured: You'll be their guests of Blind Guardian! Forever! Ha ha ha!<br />8. Blood Tears: Another soft song and it is really catchy to be heard several times. Loved the chorus a lot. Nice solo in the middle. Andre Olbrich is the man. 4.5/5<br />9. Mirror Mirror: The hit single of the album. Usually, I never get appealled with singles, but this one is different. It is amazing. Great great great song. This is like Blind Guardian's shining moment. Pure power and speed metal. 5.5/5<br />10. Face The Truth: Yep, we are facing the truth that this album so far kicks ass!<br />11. Noldor (Dead Winter Reigns): A treasure of the album and I think this is my personal favorite track. The chorus is great and the riffs and solo are superb. I love this song so much. 6/5<br />12. Battle Of Sudden Flame: Nice and amusing, but it can be forgotten sometimes.<br />13. Time Stands Still (At The Iron Hill): I heard it in the Live 2003 album and both versions are great. You feel like honoring someone on this song. Fantastic song and I love to listen to it. 5/5<br />14. The Dark Elf: A small sangable sentence. Not too much.<br />15. Thorn: Great intro and then it gets slow and it is a great song. I love the chorus and people will definitly like this song and it can be heard several times. 4.5/5<br />16. The Eldar: This is the only song that I really didn't like. Hey, don't get me wrong. I like pianos in Metal, but this one it is like over crowded, but still it can be heardable. 4/5<br />17. Nom The Wise: Another interesting narration!<br />18. When Sorrow Sang: Wow! Great song and is hard and fast. The chorus kicks ass as well. This is like one of my favorite tracks. Love this track so much. 5/5<br />19. Out On The Water: Nice singing in this one.<br />20. The Steadfast: When you hear this one, you'll feel that it is close to an end. It has a nice mood.<br />21. A Dark Passage: This is the last song on this album and it is appealling and fast. In this one, it gives you a small vision of the end of this tale by showing how they marched on. 5/5<br />22. Final Chapter (Thus Ends...): Thus ends this review and this is how the field is lost and by this I say this is a great album.<br />It is a metal classic and this album gave the big advantage of Blind Guardian. Tolkien will be proud of these 4 guys who created this great music. When I heard it, I felt that I really want to read this exciting book. Blind Guardian are number 1.
B000002C1V|1.0|It seems that Roger Waters's only goal with this  album was to alienate all of the Pink Floyd fans,  knowing that the group with him was done. It is  obvious that his attempt failed. With the release of  Momentary Lapse of Reason, The Division Bell, Delicate  Sound of Thunder and Pulse it shows that Pink Floyd can survive  without Roger Waters and after hearing what Roger Waters  has done on his own it shows that HE is not surviving very well without Floyd. This album is for the most part a Waters effort and a disgrace to the Pink Floyd name. DO NOT waste your money  on this GARBAGE even to complete your Floyd catalog.  I can see why David Gilmour had his name removed from the  production credits. It is very very clear that Gilmour was  the true heart and soul of the real Pink Floyd.
0811806405|3.0|This book was recommended to me by a luthier who had built several quitars.  I am in the process of building my first guitar and find the book to be missing many critical details and having several dimmension errors and typo's (All are corrected on Cumpiano's web site). There are some diagrams and pictures, but not nearly enough.  The pictures that are there are very dark, black and white pics that are hard to see clearly. Some of the techniques are very out of date and I have found much better material on the web.  I have found much simpler construction methods from a manual for a guitar kit from an Ohio luthier supply company that I downloaded for free.  I would recommend this book only for those interested in the history of guitar making or would like an additional reference.  THIS IS NOT A GOOD STEP BY STEP CONSTRUCTION MANUAL FOR CONSTRUCTING A GUITAR.
0486266885|2.0|Robert Louis Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was a disappointing, unstimulating, and over-graphic story.  At times it was too pictorial and at others they will change things up and no one will say or revealed a thing to save some rich man's secrete background from coming to the light.  The entire plot of the book is revealed in the first twenty pages.  Everyone has heard parts of the book.  People know Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde are the same man.  They know he drinks a potion and changes.  They know one is good and the other is evil.  Everything is known before you even read the book.  I half way expected Hyde to be huge and beast-like similarly to the way he is seen in comic books and even movies.  That part was disappointing.  The fact that the book jumps from one perspective to the next and the story is simply retold from another point of view.  It is simply not a good book.  There is a lesson in this.  If your wife tells you a book is bad and you burn the original chances are the second is going to stink just as bad.

0446677450|4.0|The author repeats himself too much.  Overall the book has some good insights.  Of course buying and reading this book will only make the author rich.  It is a good starting point for those of us that have had bad financial training throughout our lives.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|My first review...after watching Firefly I just had to write one...This is one of the best if not 'the' best sci fi series I've ever seen...great characters, cool stories all nicely packaged in 14 awesome episodes. The quality of this tv series is truly amazing...The pilot episode leaves you hooked and the last episode makes you cry in utter anguish as to how this series ever got cancelled. Why oh why you'll ask...and would be perfectly justified in doing so...unfortunately we'll never know. It's a little bit of Star Wars, umm without the jedi, and a little bit of Cowboy Bebop, without Ein..unless Joss Whedon planned a lovable furry creature to join the crew eventually...And a whole lot of western, complete with brothels and of course all that goes with it. It is truly sad that it ended before it was allowed to play out a bit..I have only one thing to say..Does that seem right to you? Watch this series, you won't regret it.
B0001FR3IQ|2.0|Most movies ask for a certain level of suspension of disbelief, but this one carries this to a ridiculous extreme.  For example, if a ghost can carve a clue into your arm, why can't it just write you a note to tell you what it wants?  Also, I'm quite certain that a medical examination after a rape is a good way for a well trained expert to determine whether or not a woman has been raped or at the very least has had sexual intercourse.  Another problem in the movie is with the fact that in a suicide investigation, the forensic examination of the body would determine whether or not injuries were received before or after death.  These and other obvious flaws in the storyline and the less than mediocre plot are just some of many reasons this movie is lacking and should be skipped.
B000002UAX|5.0|it's hard to say something original about an album that is over 35 years old. this album touches on so many music styles showing the range of the beatles talents from folk, hard rock, blues, music hall, ska, avant garde, and country. so many great songs here. \\"sexie sadie\\" which has to be one of lennon's best songs ever gets buried on disk 2 and remains one of the more obscure classics of the beatles (as obscure as a song can be from a multiplatinum album that continues to sell in huge numbers.) the edit between that song and the loud guitar burst on \\"helter skelter\\" is so shamefull that the mastering engineer of the cd should be shot. this is not the tight concise pop-rock song cycle of revolver. this is a sprawling collection of 4 guys no longer wanting to be the four headed monster. this album effectively closes the door on the psychedelic age and ushers in a new era. the idealism of 67 is replaced by a darker mood even on the acoustic numbers. the beatles as always had there collective finger on the social pulse. people talk about desert island disks - this is the ultimate. when the beatles generation is long dead and gone and they exist only as historical archives people will listen to this album and be moved and inspired by it.
B000002HEP|5.0|Dont listen to all of those 1 star reviewers cuz they dont know anything. This CD is awesome!!! Definately worth buying.
B0000AQVCL|3.0|Alright, the two singles are good, and so are a few of the other songs, but alot of the slow stuff just lulls me to sleep. I suggest downloading &quot;Are You Gonna Be my Girl&quot; and &quot;Cold Hard B****&quot; and &quot;rollover DJ&quot;, and a few others. Just don't buy the whole album unless you really like Beatles-esque slow songs. Overall, though, it is very entertaining.
B00004W52U|4.0|This CD is pretty good. I'm not a ska fan really, but that proves that this band can appeal to punk fans. Most of the songs on this CD are wonderful. Full of energy and screaming at an intense speed. At times the lead singer's (Jesse's?) voice reminds me of Ian Mckaye's. OpIvy spawned the awful band Rancid, and has influenced many other terrible bands like Less than Jake, but they can be forgiven. Nevermind the low sound quality, I find that to make this CD all the better. While I realize that it is not exactly at par with the Ramones, Stiff Little Fingers, Minor Threat, any good punk band, they are still good. They played Punk/Ska without sounding poppy. It can be a real relief from the heavier punk bands, but still satisfies a punk's needs in music.
B000002KON|5.0|ray davies took a step away from the nostalgia of village green preservation society and something else to create one of the finest albums of the late sixties. while the album retains some of the anglocentric nostalgia of the previous albums, it is reinforced with a more contemporary sound and more muscular band dynamic.  more coherent as a concept album than tommy, this album never drags.  it goes from strength to strength.  shangri-la stands out as one of the finest compositions in the davies catalog and one of the best pop rock songs ever.  why didn't this album get any attention?
B0001HAHXW|2.0|Eric clapton long ago cemented Himself as one of the Best Guitarist Ever especially back in the 60's,but after a while he found a way to play it safe&He does it here again as He has been doing for many years now.Robert Johnson was Raw&wicked.Eric Clapton has displayed some of that Element Before but it's been so long that after a while He is basically a Vegas Lounge Act with Talent but who hasn't mattered in so long.this Album will keep him safe&in place to where he is but He didn't bring any Light to the Rawness that was Robert Johnson.
B000094DUP|5.0|This album is incredible. I've had it for over a year and it and it is still the best album I have ever bought! <br />Each song means something and her amazing vocals and piano skills amaze!<br />Micheal Hunt and followers- Looks like you forgot to do your research; Delta had 3 No.1's before she was diagnosed with cancer.
B000005JAB|5.0|The cover pic might give it away - John sits in a wicker chair, in a very dapper white suit and vest, staring calmly into the camera (or the eye of the viewer, perhaps).  The music on this album is indeed some of the gentlest he ever recorded - pop songs (his own slightly skewed variety, of course...) recorded in Los Angeles in 1973, augmented by some lovely orchestral arrangements.  The only song in the set that comes close to a `rock' motif is `Macbeth', Cale's reworking/reprise of Shakespearean tragedy - the rest are slow-or medium-tempo numbers that all fall pretty much into the `mellow' category.<br />If you read `mellow' as `boring', however, you'd be sadly mistaken - the songs here are built upon some lovely, memorable melodies and arrangements, but they're far from boring.  Cale's lyrics here are as wry and intelligent as on any of his more raucous releases - there's insight, humor and irony aplenty in these tunes.  He comments on an array of subjects - loneliness, history (and the lessons we either learn or don't, as the case may be), morality, longing, love, pretension, art, religion (this subject being mentioned/invoked more than a couple of times), and more.  For instance, in `Hanky panky nohow' Cale sings:  `Nothing frightens me more than religion at my door - I never answer panic knocking...'  In `Andalucia', a beautiful love song, the image of `castles and Christians' is painted;  and in `Paris 1919' which I read as a ghost story of sorts), the perceived threat or terror felt at the encounter with the unexplainable is answered with `I'm the bishop and I've come to claim you with my iron drum'.<br />And speaking of ghosts, their presence haunts several of the songs - ghosts from history (Columbus, Segovia, Graham Greene, Macbeth and Banquo) parade before us, and in general the taste and feeling of eras bygone inhabit the program, leaving the listener with the feeling of actually witnessing, albeit it in an evanescent form, scenes from other times.  Cale's intellect and imagination (and, again, his humor) are powerful tools - he pulls it off nicely, that which might be handled clumsily by an artist less deft.<br />This is certainly a far cry from the stark and seminal FEAR, and the rocked-out SLOW DAZZLE that were to follow.  For a really raw, brutal live recording (and a great, energetic document), check out SABOTAGE from 1979.  PARIS 1919 is definitely a transition album from his beautiful THE ACADEMY IN PERIL (1972), which is my all-time favorite from his catalogue, to the harsher music that would follow - but an essential document for anyone who wants to understand the complete artist.Cale's intellect and imagination (and, again, his humor) are powerful tools - he pulls it off nicely, that which might be handled clumsily by an artist less deft.<br />This is certainly a far cry from the stark and seminal FEAR, and the rocked-out SLOW DAZZLE that were to follow.

B00001OH80|1.0|As many of the other reviewers i am a long time bowie fan.  i saw him on the sound + vision, outside, and current reality tours.  i have every scrap he has ever released commercially (and a few bootlegs as well.)  this album along with never let me down are the nadir of his career.  he admits that he wasn't very into making music in the mid 80s and it shows.  this album suffers from the 80s synth-pop gloss and very uninspired songwriting.  i must admit a guilty affection for the cover of &quot;god only knows.&quot; other than &quot;blue jean&quot; the rest of the album is unlistenable to me.  i never replaced my cassette copy and doubt that i ever will.
B0001Z53AQ|1.0|and aside from gimmicks never will be.\\"My Band\\" is funny&Cracks Me up especially the video but like so much of this album it feels like One Big inside joke that wears itself to thin in a real hurry.the Lyrics are better this time around but then again that ain't saying much compared to there debut set.this is One of those Tax Write Off acts for a Label.but they will do some Business thanks to Hype&the Cat who is running the show.
B000003TA4|1.0|Nirvana's biggest, most popular hit, \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" is a absolute rip-off of Love & Rockets song called \\"No New Tale To Tell\\". So much, in fact, that if Nirvana were sued for plagiarizing, they would undoubtedly lose the fight. I've read that a few have said that SLTS is a rip-off of the Pixies' \\"Debaser\\", but THAT rumour is just not true. The one about \\"No New Tale To Tell\\" IS infact true. Listen to \\"No New Tale to Tell\\". The guitar riff used thoughout was stolen by Kurt Cobain and used in \\"Rape Me\\" as well. As for the songs off Nevermind-- They are the epitome of what Cobain hated; glossy-sounding 80's drum reverb effects were used... the same effects Madonna and Wilson Phillips used in their 80's pop schlop. Cobain could have at least caved in and admitted he never had any punk sensibilities, but instead he lied and claimed he still had the punk rock ethos despite the fact that he gave mainstream America what it wanted.
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|Visually stunning, a wonderful score and soundtrack, coupled with a touching story and endearing characters. It's the story of a married man, soon to have a child, trying to reconnect with his dying father, after only knowing him through the tall tales of his life.<br />The movie is a dozen stories in one, with something for everybody. Action, adventure, comedy, romanance, whimsy, fantasy and wit - it has it all. A film for artistic types who refuse to grow up, and would sometimes rather hear the nice, exaggerated story than the awful, dull truth. This movie allows each of us to let our imaginations run wild and let go of cynicsm and stress, if only for a few hours. Thought it does bring up other interesting points. Such as \\"When is it time to let fantasy go and start being honesy?\\" or \\"Is a nice lie better than the truth?\\"<br />Thought provoking, sad, joyful and worth watching more than once.
0553269631|1.0|I personally found the book slow and dull. It could not keep me interested and that is unusual since I can normally read just about any book that is put before me. There isn't much more I can really say about this book.

B0001BKAEE|3.0|I remembered all the hype to the second film's release.  The chatter about how spectacular this series was going to be.  How 'The Matrix' would be the hallmark of true sci-fi films and that continuing the story was an awesome idea.  I also recall the thousands of disappointed drones sulking out of the theatres scolding the second movie.  I was warned off the second movie by many of those upset sunshine-fans, but I saw it anyway and enjoyed it.  These same disgruntled fans of the first film who disliked the second went, I feel, to the third bitter and expecting to be bored.  When they came out hating the trilogies' finale I wasn't surprised.  That didn't stop me from seeing the second and it didn't stop me from finishing off the series.<br />I didn't go into the third film with any expectations.  Many hated the second and I still enjoyed that one.  I held the same hopes for the final installment.<br />It fell flat.  I didn't like too much.<br />Why?  Well it didn't disappoint me because I had no expectations based on the first picture.  Just as a film on its own, it didn't work for me.  Overall I found it to be random, overly dramatic at points, and hurried on major plot hooks.  Where the first two films focused mainly on Neo, the final movie seems to place that character in the passenger seat.  Sure he's still important but you start to wonder, &quot;Why?&quot;  And, &quot;Why is he doing that?&quot;  A lot of the actions taken by the characters didn't seem to have any purpose.  They just 'acted' and you sort of wondered why.  What information did they have that we didn't that could clear some of this up?  The flow of the movie was choppy and seemed rushed to just finish.<br />The biggest problem I had with the second movie was how they portrayed Zion.  When they dicussed it in the original I expected a more 'Mad Max' sort of refuge for the remaining humans.  Not a giant underground rave.  Outside of Zion the second movie was good.  Unfortunately 'Revolutions' spends most of its time in Zion.  The giant battle scene, although very pretty to watch, was expected and somewhat lame.  Wasn't so impressive.<br />As far as Neo and how the movie ends?  Hey, has anyone read the 'Dune' books?  Muad'dib Neo follows so closely to 'Dune Messiah' at times it was incredible.  I loved the action and unexpected twist that led to an enjoyable ending.  Of course I liked it when I read it from Frank Herbert and thought it was a giant ball of cheese in 'Revolutions'.  The ending was not original.  Not enjoyable.<br />I'd say wait til this movie comes out on DVD to see it, but that's what I did.  And I still thought it time spent that I could have done something else.  If you're a 'Matrix' fan, see 'Revolutions'.  Just to complete the story.  It wasn't horrible but it also wasn't good.  I'm glad I saw it but I'm in no rush to see it again.
B00005JMEW|5.0|If you liked Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown and Resevoir Dogs, you know you'll love Kill Bill.<br />Tarantino takes a stab at making the ultimate exploitation film, borrowing from as many genres as he can. Only, instead of making it exploitive, he makes it empowering. Uma Thurman is an ex-employee for a team of expert assasins, and she's hell bent on revenge for the murder of her fiance and her attempted murder. She is anything but a damsel in distress. She's a hand-to-hand combater, a samurai warrior, a master escape artist and a crafty detective. (...)If this movie isn't modern day feminism, I don't know what is.<br />Like any Tarantino film, this movie has brilliant, inventive cinematography, great dialogue, amazing action scenes and choregography, fantastic music and just bursting with wit and well...it's just hip.<br />Not for the queemish and weak-stomached. And look out-there are subtitles. But then again, if you're not the \\"reading type\\", the sheer brilliance would probably go over your head anyway.

There are many differences  So, if you snatch up this book and use it to brush up - you might be doing a lot of things very wrong in punctuation.<br />Britain has a \\"Tight Little Island\\" feel, they often do not bother to look at the rest of the world and see their way is not the only way.  This book is a prime example of that.<br />Also, I was dismayed by the writer's obsessing with a comma, to the point of displaying VERY BAD MANNERS.  One should never make fun of shortcomings in other; one should never do it publicly as she claims she does.  It shows a distinct lack of breeding.  Manner should never go out of style.<br />So, if you want a wee giggle and love dry Brit humour, you might enjoy this.  If you want a real book for American usages buy \\"New York Public Library Writer's Guide to Style and Usage\\".
0553382179|3.0|I loved this book; it was great.  It was very helpful, and inspiring, and all the things that everyone claims.  BUT... every SINGLE useful tip in the book is available for FREE on the FlyLady website (flylady.net).  Every last one.      I have lent this book around to my friends and family who are less inclined to get their info online, so it wasn't a waste of money for me personally.  But if you have an internet connection (which I assume you must if you are reading this!), you can read the book for free on the site - almost word for word.  With the money you'll save, you can buy all the supplies for your Control Journal.
B0001I55OC|4.0|Timeline is a good movie full of action that may not stay that close to Michael Crichton's novel, but it is still worth a watch.  A government agency, the IFC, has developed a machine that can transport people through time.  The only problem is that is only goes through a wormhole to 1357 Castlegard, France.  A team of archaeoligical students must travel back in time to try and find their missing professor.  Once there, they must survive the English and French armies.  Making it worse is that they are transported back on the day of a French attack on the English army.  The plot jumps around a lot which can make the story somewhat confusing.  Even so, this movie is still a lot of fun to watch with plenty of good action.  <br />  The ensemble cast of Timeline is surprisingly good.  Basically, Paul Walker has to look startled and scream a lot, but he is alright as Chris Johnston, the son of the missing professor.  Frances O'Connor plays Kate Ericson, the romantic interest and a member of the team.  Gerard Butler is excellent as Andre Marek, a member of the team who has a passion for Medieval times.  The movie also stars Bill Connolly, Neal McDonough, Anna Friel, Matt Craven, and Ethan Embry.  The DVD offers a three-part documentary on the making of, four featurettes, theatrical trailers, and widescreen presentation.  For a very entertaining movie with plenty of action and a decent cast, check out Timeline!
B00008N6N5|5.0|Larry Flynt is a sleaze, and he's not afraid to exlpoit that fact.  The People Vs. Larry Flynt doesn't make him look like a saint, as some have said.  Milos Forman is a great director, and he takes this material and turns it into a very compelling look at a man, (who is very sleazy, mind you), that cared immensely about the First Amendment and turned the judicial system upside down. (And made and spent lots of money!)  Like it or not, Flynt is a crusader for free speech in the annals of American history.  Great film, and FINALLY a great DVD.  However, where's the Forman commentary?
B0001Z53CY|4.0|D-12 is one of the most slept on groups out in the game now.  Other than the Wu, not many groups end up very succesful but I honestly think that more people should listen to this album with an open mind.<br />I was expecting something totally different when I bought this album, so I didnt like it at first.  And that was a mistake on my part.  After listening to the album the past 2 days I've really been feeling it now.  Much love D12!!!!<br />Stand out songs are Loyalty, 6 In The Morning, How Come, Get My Gun, B****, 40 oz., American Psycho II, Good Die Young, and Keep Talkin.  I'm still not to sure what I think about Git Up... some people have seemed to love it or hate it.<br />All I can say on this album is don't have any expectations for this album before you listen to it.  If you like Eminem and D12 then definetly pick up this album.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This CD is Amazing...Oooh Kristin!!  Her voice is just the most versatile thing ever...Kristin, good luck at the Tony's.
B00000J7SS|5.0|I am honestly astounded by the reviews of the nay-sayers. Some of them claim that most of the people who like this album are just pretending to do so to be &quot;cool.&quot; Nothing could be farther from the truth for me. Out of all the jazz albums I own, this and Coltrane's Meditations are the two that I listen to when I want something with feeling and passion. I honestly feel moved whenever I listen to it, like someone has taken all the strange, conflicting thoughts in my head and set them to music. <br />As with most two-disc sets produced by Miles in this period (the only one I listen to substantially), both discs are great. There is not a bad or even mediocore song on here; even the &quot;bonus&quot; track has something to it, which is more than I can say for lots of Miles rereleases (please, save the alternative takes for the box set!). As a matter of fact, I would rate it as the best studio album he ever recorded. It's certainly the one I listen to the most. In tearms of best Miles album, period, I'd say it's a tie between this and Agharta. While Agharta focuses more on live improvisation and melodic grooves, this is more about studio experimentation; the soundscapes and interplay represented here were deliberately engineered to sound the way they do and are not so much the product of chance.<br />Despite the praise I have for this album, I must agree with many other reviewers in this: it's not for everyone. If you are a big fan of Birth of the Cool and Kind of Blue, please reconsider your actions before buying this. It is NOT traditional jazz at all and is not anything like either of those albums. For me, that's a good thing, but some people may not like that. Also, if you are looking for a &quot;fun&quot; record, go someplace else. This is not happy, this is not fun, and this is not bright at all. It is depressing, dissonant music that takes itself &quot;too seriously,&quot; and if you don't like that sort of thing, then please stay away. As mentioned before, Frank Zappa might be a better choice for those looking for experimental 60's music with a lighter tone to it.
038572179X|5.0|An incredible book, which I cannot recommend highly enough with any qualification.  With Atonement, McEwan has set a new standard for the modern novel.  All the elements are superb: story, structure, characterisations, obersevations, and an absolutely engrossing writing style.  His story leads the reader in, and every page builds on the many false climaxes and leads.  But the clues are all there.  Just when one thinks one has worked out the story, the next page holds a surprise - and not a single gimmicky twist in the book.  Such is his mastery of the medium that a simple, seemingly afterthought of initials and date turns the entire story around.  Absolutely wonderful, readable, emotional, and brilliant.
B000069HK2|5.0|if you have never heard of the used and you have even the slightest respect for musical passion do yourself a favor and buy this album today. every last track on this flawless disc drips with a zeal for music not seen in more years than i care to remember. frontman bert mckracken delivers his soulful lyrics with such force and fervor you won't help but understand the love he has for his craft. emo and rock fans this album is a must. rockstar hopefulls this album is a must. music lovers this album is a must. anyone...this album is a must!
B00004TJKB|3.0|In 1993 , director Harold Ramis genius of dark comedies like ''Analyze This'' casted Bill Murray as Phil Connors in this dark but mostly enjoyable movie named GroundHog Day.<br />Bill Murray plays Phil Connors a weatherman, who covers everything from weather to Ground Day. Phil isn't happy with his life, in fact he realizes that he is repeating the same routine over and over again. From work in the morning,to<BR>talking to the annoying Ned Ryanser( Stephen Tobolowsky), while listening to Sonny and Cher in the morning to covering the stupid GroundHog Day, Phil is repeating the same day over and over again. Of course the irony here as done by the plot, is that he is the only that knows it. It's like an episode the ''Twilight Zone'' (which I reviewed too on other sites). Eventually Phil has a mental breakdown in which he plans to do whatever he wants. He comes completely unglued when realizing how wasted his life had become, and thus wants to change it.<br />I use the term breakdown because well Phil isn't exactly a nice guy, he's arrogant and obnoxious. We hardly sympathize with this guy, much less that he is miserable. However, the point the movie makes is the guy realizes he has been wasting his life<BR>away and wants to change it, although Phil's change doesn't go ahead smoothly.<br />He drives reckless around the train tracks, gets arrested, steals a bagfull of money from a couple of dumb cops, charms his way into sleeping with a beautiful young girl and yet finds out that he still isn't happy. Until he puts the moves on Rita (Andy McDowell), his producer. McDowell is the few actresses that I know that has limited acting potential but her beautiful presence can convey some emotions making her sympathetic.<br />However, in order to get close to Rita, Phil has to get info on her likes and dislikes from her friends. This angle in the movie, really made me a little sick, because even we are suppose to sympathize with Phil, he hasn't really changed all that much. Rita,eventually finds out Phil's motives and slaps him in the face, and telling him to get lost. Phil though in order to impress her and to change himself, starts doing bizarre, yet unreal things that get him attention and he does start to become nicer.<br />This is where the movie gets ridiculous, because even though this is a comedy, I found the rest of the movie to be predictable, superficial, yet enjoyable<br />Phil becomes a gifted ice sculpter (who knows where he learned this) as one scene, where his cutting a sculpture of an ice angel is shown. Then Phil saves a guy from choking to death, a kid from a falling tree and a host of other surprises. LOL<br />Yes Harold Ramis does go a bit over the top with this Phil guy, obviously a lot of the stuff he pulls of is almost impossible giving Phil's background, but Ramis is again trying to show the point (although laughingly bad) that Phil is changing. He now has a heart and will do anything to be with this nice woman and of course by Phil doing this he has filled that empty void that he had when he was repeating the same unfulling routine of covering that stupid Groundhog Day in Pennsylvania.<br />Still though Ramis does do a good job of making us think about the movie and Phil itself and gives us that scary thought that we perhaps might end up like Phil, a shriveled, ugly man who has been repeating the same stupid routine yet doesn't have the capacity to see that this misery is at his own doing.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I really think that In The Zone is a quality album. It's tastefully done and it has a lot of good tracks. Defiantly not a waste of your money, a couple tacky songs but overall its a great album to listen too. <BR>My Song Ratings:<br />*Me Against The Music: 3/5- it's a good song, but I'm just not a big fan out of it. But if you liked this single when it came out you will like the song.<BR>*(I Got That) Boom Boom: 4/5- a catchy beat, I actually really enjoy this song I think its fun, and its a good song to dance to<BR>*Showdown: 3/5- It's a alright track, not very much singing kind of talked through, but it's overall okay the chorus makes it a pretty catchy song.<BR>*Breathe On Me: 4/5-very sensual and just a fun song to listen to<BR>*Early Mornin: 4/5-a very interesting song, I like it, its something you get stuck in your head, but it also makes britney sound amazing<BR>*Toxic: 5/5- my favorite track off the album, fun to dance to and sing to, if you like the single you will like the song of course.<BR>*Outrageous: 2/5- one of the tackier songs on the album, the chorus really ruins the song I think.<BR>*Touch Of My Hand:4/5- Tastefully done...not to over the top with sexuality. An overall good song.<BR>*The Hook Up-4/5-kind of rap music I guess, its a good song though, britney sounds really good in it<BR>*Shadow-3/5- Not one of my favorites, its a slow song but it shows Britney can sing some mild slow songs...it's just alright<BR>*Brave New Girl: 3/5 The other really tacky song on the album, just a really stupid song I think<BR>*Everytime: 4/5- It's all right, if you like the single you will like the song....<BR>*Remix of Me Against the Music: 4/5- I think its better then the original, its more of something to dance to and its a little more fun<br />I think this is a great album; it's something you can listen to over and over again and not get tired of it, plus its great music to drive to.
B000002HMH|4.0|Most reviews following this album, and following the black album, either directly or indirectly hinted at the fact that Metallica had sold out to the commercial industry. Those reviews stated that Metallica was no longer a band for the people by the people.  In a way they are exactly right, Metallica had become a commercially influenced band- but upon that realization we must ask ourselves two VERY important questions. 1. Was Metallica ever NOT a commercial &quot;sell-out&quot; band? and 2. Is this kind of selling out really so bad in the scheme of things?  My answer to the first question is- yes.  I am sure in the very beginnings of this bands heavy thrash career, during the Dave Mustaine days, this band was fusing two forms of music to create their own sinister breed of deathly bone chilling hell rock that even Mr. Glenn Danzig would hold to his heart as the real friggin deal.  Understand though, that they WERE taking two popular forms of music that most of us would call &quot;sell out&quot; music and fusing it.  In this light they were never so brilliant and out of the box- they just followed the trends of the day to a calibur higher than most bands, and that is why they were great- NOT because they created a new bar, but they consistently rose above the set bar. And to address the &quot;band of the people&quot; thing I hear all to much, I am sorry but that had nothing to do with their music as much as it did their attitude- which by the way folks, hasn't changed much. Some say the napster thing showed they were full of their own BS, but if someone was stealing your masterpiece, you would die to make sure it remained undefiled by thieves. Thieves are NOT the common people- hopefully. To the second question I will say this, if &quot;selling out&quot; is too conform to what the popular trend of the day is, then no, its not that bad at all. We create our own culture, and when enough go against that culture a new culture is forged. I say this to point out that our popular trends make up our culture, so when a band changes with that the popular trend they show their affinity for wanting to make an impact on the listening audience, and they show, yes, their love for the common people. So when they took the turn in Load to the more popular alternative trends of the time, was it a bad thing to do? It would have been a bad thing if the music was bad. For the most part, the music was again, above the bar. They were still fusing popular music too... country, alternative, metal etc.. so really they were just being artists as they had always done. Do not focus on the logistics of our cultures pull to label this band as &quot;sell out&quot; or &quot;commercial&quot;, just focus on what is put before you and you will find that Load is a very rewarding album.
B00005JKMQ|1.0|&quot;Ali&quot; is the attempted biographical movie <BR>on Muhammed Ali's life, through the eyes <BR>of Michael Mann (Miami Vice). <br />Although, I liked &quot;Ali&quot; for the most the part, <BR>there were some problems with the film, that <BR>prevented from me calling it a good film. <br />First of, the acting for most of the film is <BR>badly acted, started with the major star <BR>Will Smith who acts as Ali. Smith <BR>is not convincing as the legendary champion, <BR>he delivers his lines basically without <BR>any emotion or comprehension of what he is saying <BR>with the only exception being when Smith recites <BR>the famous lines by Ali such as &quot;I am King <BR>of World. Sting like a butterfly float a bee&quot;. <br />The only real good points about Ali is that it <BR>does show 3 factual things about the real <BR>Ali. For instance, how Ali's real is Cassius <BR>Clay, but after he joined the nation of Islam <BR>and Malcom X. He changed his named to Cassius X. <BR>Then after meeting the head of Islam, <BR>Elijah, Muhammed, he changed <br />his name to Muhammed Ali. <br />Some people called it a landmark film, but it's <BR>not. Some people even said that &quot;Ali&quot; showed <BR>Ali as a great civil rights leader, but it didn't <BR>do that either. <br />For instance , although &quot;Ali&quot; was friends <BR>with both Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, <BR>he had only brief contact with them. <br />Also was not totally supportive of Malcolm X <BR>(played well by Mario Van Peebles) <BR>. Ali's manipulation by the nation of Islam and it's leader, drove a wedge between the friendship between Ali and Malcolm X. <br />The film also shows how Ali was a contracting <BR>young man and older man. For instance, <BR>his mistreatment of his wife Sonji ( Jada Pinkett) <BR>after he follows the rule of Islam to discipline her. <br />Now I as I said the acting in the film is <BR>really bad. Will Smith, probably didn't do <BR>alot of research into the character of Ali, as <BR>his lack of any feeling into some of the <BR>serious areas of the movie (like his <BR>reaction to civil riots ,Malcolm X and the <BR>threat of him going to prison for avoiding <BR>the draft). <br />I mean Smith does an ok job, when imitating <BR>the famous lines by Ali such as &quot;Float like <BR>a butterfly sting like a bee&quot;, or &quot;I am King <BR>of The World&quot;. But when it comes down to <BR>delivering real, reactions for Ali, Smith <BR>is both laughable and mediocre. <br />For instance, there is a scene where Ali (Smith) <BR>sees the trouble of civil rights on tv, and <BR>yet his reaction is just something like &quot;Wow, <br />or uh oh&quot;. LOL Then later on in the movie, when <BR>Ali is threatened with imprisonment for refusing <BR>to fight in the Vietnam War (yes he refused to fight), he basically just looks stonefaced, and <BR>doesn't have the serious type of reaction you <BR>would expect someone going to prison would have. <br />However, there are a couple of good actors in the <BR>movie (not Smith) <BR>that prevents &quot;Ali&quot; from being <BR>a total failure . <br />Jon Voight is great as legendary, ego maniac, <BR>sports announcer Howard Cosell (who ended <BR>his career in disgrace). <br />Cosell was one of the biggest sports <BR>voices in history, he had memorable <BR>interviews with Ali, sports team like <BR>the Lakers and many other great sports <BR>figures, but by the end of his career <BR>Howard's ego got the best of him, and eventually no one wanted to see this guy <BR>on the air. <br />Mario Van Peebles as Malcolm X, also deserves <BR>some honorable mention as he does get into <BR>Malcolm X characters, and his view on the <BR>civil rights movement, and some of his <BR>problems with Ali. <br />The other big complaints about the film was <BR>that the film concentrated on the early <BR>life of Ali, but not his life afterwards in <BR>the 1980's, as critc Roger Ebert states. <br />Now the DVD for the film, like the film is a bit <BR>of adisappointment: <br />The only bonus feature for the film is <BR>the trailer. <br />There is no behind the scenes look at the film, no <BR>&quot;making of&quot; featurette, no nothing. <br />There is not even no commentary for the film!!! <br />Michael Mann either was too busy, <BR>or too damn lazy to do the commentary, because it would have given him the chance to respond <BR>to the criticism for this part of the film, <BR>instead he chose not to do any commentary <BR>for the film and so the criticism <BR>for the film will stand. <br />In the end, while Michael Mann tried to do a fair <BR>attempt at the making of &quot;Ali&quot; there are alot <BR>of problems that prevent him from doing so. <br />First, of, his main star , Will Smith, is just <BR>plain awful as &quot;Ali&quot; . Smith, probably got <BR>paid his millions for the film, but he ain't <BR>worth it. <br />Second, Mann, only covers the early years, and not <BR>the later years for the legend, when he would take <BR>beatings in the ring, and would later get <BR>Parkinson's disease, which would leave Ali <BR>partially paralyzed and barely to speak (Ali <BR>speaks in mumbles). <br />In the end, I can't recommend &quot;Ali&quot; because <BR>it just basically could have been a heck of alot <BR>better, and the dvd without the commentary , just <BR>basically sums up the film as basically an average <BR>attempt at creating a biography for the heavyweight <BR>champion. <br />The bright side, is that there is a new film/dvd <BR>which is a real biography on Ali, showing actual <BR>interviews and clips of the real Ali, so you're <BR>better of checking that one out than this movie.
B000002OZY|4.0|I agree with the previous reviewer - while the original 'Tommy' is historically significant and a decent rock album, it pales in comparison to the live recording on 'Live at Leeds Deluxe Edition.'<br />Don't get me wrong, I enjoy 'Tommy' and when I first got the album I loved it.  However, when I listen to it now the whole thing seems kind of sluggish.  When you listen to 'Live at Leeds' you realize how much the visceral energy improves the music, especially on numbers like 'Christmas' and 'Go to the Mirror.'  While there are certain numbers in which the studio polish helps out (usually involving the singers being on pitch), on the whole the 'Live at Leeds' recording is infinitely superior to the studio production (also, the program of the live performance is more streamlined).<br />To recap: If you want the best performance of 'Tommy' available, stick with 'Live at Leeds.'  If you're a die-hard Who collector, you already have both versions so it doesn't matter.
B00006CXXU|5.0|gd album, gd voice. (...)
0312995423|1.0|Too bad, there might have been a book here, but wooden characters and stodgy plot creaking along certainly doesn't make it worth the reading time.. actually you can read it really quickly by reading every other page. You won't miss anything.
B0000VAFO0|3.0|Underworld is pretty dark and weird. I enjoyed watching it though. It had one main thing going for it and that was the storyline of what would happen if a vampire and werewolf mixed together? A supermonster would be created. Half vampire and half werewolf sounds half crazy but very interesting. That is exactly the problem I had with the film. Let me explain as best I can. You see, this movie builds up this ever-impending fight between the vampires, in particular the ancient vampires, and the werewolves. The werewolves are tired of being slaves to the vampires, so they have come together and organized to make a super race of werewolves that can annihilate the vampires. Well, you can't wait to see it happen and then you do but you want more and you get the end of the movie. On top of getting to see the vampire/werewolf hybrid, you get a little disappointed when you see him fight; he's not so mighty is all I'll say.<br />I want a sequel to this movie. Now I'm not a sequel nut but this movie definitely could use a sequel. I want to know more about the supermonster that was created in the movie. I'd love to see all the powers that such a creature would have in it's arsenal. Underworld 2 needs to make it's presence felt but this time with a vengeance.
0316666343|1.0|The book would have been perfect if it ended at the first chapter.  The concept of the story is good but was poorly writen.  The story went on and on and on... then ended.  <BR>A good idea gone bad.
B00000HYXB|5.0|If God exists, Blind Guardian is his greatest gift to his creation. This is an album by Blind Guardian about a story by the greatest fantasy writer ever.  You do the math here my friends.  This album represents everything that is good in this universe.  Specifically, Blind Guardian is a group of consummate Metal musicians with incredible skill, Thomen is the greatest drummer ever, and Hansi's vocals are uniquely incredible.  Furthermore the songs are a brilliant interpretation of Tolkiens stories. It is the greatest piece of greatness ever to be great. You will become a better person if you buy this album
B000001DVD|3.0|I rated this album three stars because there is some filler on here, but there's a lot of good stuff, too. I enjoy most of it, but like I said, some of it can be quite filler. It is all very AC/DC influenced, sometimes to an extreme. But it all works out evenly. Some of the best songs on here are Another Hit And Run, Bringin' On The Heartbreak, and Mirror, Mirror. Overall, this is a pretty good album by AC/DC worshiping kids.
B00000DHZJ|5.0|This is the first Jimi Hendrix CD I bought.After hearing these songs I was left wanting somewhat more. I now have Are You Experienced, Axis:Bold as Love, Electric Ladyland, Band of Gypsys, Live at Woodstock (2CD), Live at the Fillmore East(2CD), Live at the Isle of Wight(2CD), and BBC Sessions (2CD). I couldn't help myself! I had to give the album 5 stars but if you really want to get into Hendrix start with Are You Experienced?
B000063DFN|5.0|Once again, Iron Maiden bang their heads hard on this classic release. The album has an overall Egyptian theme, which is pretty interesting. This is another classic release from Maiden. The theme of the songs is about dogfighting war planes on Aces High, an Egyptian king on Powerslave, war on 2 Minutes to Midnight, and the legend of the Ancient Mariner on the 13 minute-plus Rime Of The Ancient Mariner. Also, Bruce Dickonson's love for fencing is shown on Flash Of The Blade and The Duellists. This album is a must-have for any headbanger. Go out and get it.
B00005V1WO|5.0|Gothic is one of Ken Russell's best films. Of course his work isn't for everyone, and I know some people just hate his movies, and complain about their content and self indulgence. But for me, these are some of his strong points, being prepared to experiment with his subject matter, and produce his own unique vision. Gothic tells of a meeting, in Switzerland, between: Byron (Gabriel Byrne), Shelly, Mary Shelly (Natasha Richardson), and two lesser known figures: Clair Clairmont and Dr Polidori.  The beginning and end of the film both look like period piece dramas. What comes in between is Ken Russell's unique vision. The characters, during a stormy knight, invent stories and create a monster of their own imaginations. These involve all of Ken Russell's favorite images for film (and hence the self indulgent criticism): Religion, vampirism, sumptuously films sets, a plot that verges on the fantastical, and nudity. Of interest though is the way the narrative deals with death, as there is an interesting sequence where Mary Shelly has visions of the demise of all the principles in the film. Of course it all ties in with the Birth of one of English literature's most memorable books: Frankenstein (by Mary Shelly).  Gothic is a Master Piece from Ken Russell, one of his most interesting films that challenges the viewer immensely. Sadly, however, not all will get it.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I love Sarah Mclachlans voice, can can't help but get wrapped up in it.  She has the most beautiful voice is the whole world.  My favorite song is World of fire.
B0001Z53CY|4.0|If you liked the first D12 CD, you will like this one too.  The best songs on this cd are:<br />How Come - Great beat and very powerfull lyrics<BR> <BR>Get my Gun- Great beat, as D12 makes fun of people who don't think before they act.  Classic D12<br />40Oz- Great beat, would make a great party song<br />Bitch-  Classic shady and crew<br />Good Die young-  Powerfull song about one of the original d12 members (Bugz)<br />My Band- good for a laugh
B0002234LS|4.0|Johnny Depp stars as Mort Rainey, a writer who has had some success.  He is awakened by a man named John Shooter (John Turturro) who claims that Depp stole his story and published it.  Depp agrees to show Shooter proof that he did not steal the story, while Shooter makes it clear that he intends to make Mort's life tough until he obtains the proof.<br />This is just the beginning of the story, the window dressing.  What makes the film excellent is the acting.  Depp is wonderful again as a writer who is dealing with recent tragedy in his life.  Turturro is great as an almost over the top tough, Charles Dutton is a strong supporting friend/lawyer for Mort, and Timothy Hutton is menacing as the boyfriend of Mort's soon to be ex wife.<br />The plot is complex and twists often, but never out of control.  All the time, Depp is great and he really shows his range.  This character requires him to be in control of himself, but just barely.  There is an edge required here based on the situations the character goes through.  Depp pulls it off beautifully.  By the time the credits roll, you will be impressed.  The story makes sense, and the surprise ending is good (not great) but the strength of the acting makes this almost a must-see.
B00005JMEW|5.0|The first installment of the Kill Bill series is one of Quentin Tarantino's finest! All Tarantino fans will be more than pleased. It is a nonstop roller coaster ride of carefully crafted fight sequences and blood spurting action that puts slasher flicks to shame. The excessive splatter of blood in nearly every scene and limited dialogue holds up to the formula of the original Kung Fu movies and you will find yourself laughing along at the absurdity of it. Kill Bill Vol. 1 is a nice blend of Kung Fu and anime with a little western twist to it that will have you hooked from the opening scene. The story is also riveting. You really connect with Uma Thurman's character and are rooting for her the whole way through. Can't wait for the next installment!
B000002BFZ|5.0|They're not much remembered for No Code, but it's the strongest of the Pearl Jam record because they followed their muse wherever it took them, and in this case, it was to diverse soundscapes.  &quot;Who You Are&quot; is all over the map musically, but it's moving on a level they'd never aimed for before.  Same goes for the unconventionally astonishing &quot;Red Mosquito&quot; and &quot;Hail Hail.&quot;  The most conventional song on here, &quot;Off He Goes,&quot; and the most experimental, the spoken word &quot;I'm Open&quot; act as separate ends for Pearl Jam's capabilities, and both are majestic statements of adulthood.  It's no surprise this album is such a turning point in their career.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|Im 23, and i loved the movie. I found it funny and entertaining. I think it bored my husband, but most chick flicks do bore him and almost every other man. Still a good movie.
B000092ZYX|3.0|Hail to the Thief doesn't do it for me like OK Computer and Kid A, and there's one reason why: this time around, it's about the songs and not the record.  Those albums are conceptual masterpieces, the apotheosis of what can be accomplished in the record form.  Hail to the Thief, while full of great (well, mostly just pretty good) songs, feels like a collection of unrelated songs, a moody, atmospheric b-sides collection.  Any other band would be hailed for such work, but we hold Radiohead to a higher standard - when a great band makes a just good album, it's a little bit awful.
B000062YAZ|2.0|Listen to one song and you have Slayers entire career. This band is nothing but a bunch of guys that aren't smart enough to do anything besides band instruments and sing the same voice over and over again. <br />Just because they are old doesnt make them good. I gave them an extra star because without the vocals there is some nice background music here.<br />If you want a band that grows into something better with each Cd, then try Slipknot or Otep.
B0000AQVCL|4.0|I'll tell you what, Its been a long time since we've had some damn good rock&roll and this is exactly what we've been waiting for!! If you guys like ac/dc, the who , the rolling stones, this is a frigg'n no brainer!!<br />Without a doubt the BEST new rock-n-roll band!!!
B00018D44U|4.0|I had heard about Nora.  Recently NPR ran a spot on her new album, this album.  Hearing a few tunes, I was intrigued and enticed ... more or less captivated by the sound.  Her jazzy timbre is mixed with a tad of country and a hint of pop.  Each track will keep you guessing what's next.  When in the car, I find my self listening and \\"taking the long way home.\\"  I am looking forward to backing up and discovering, \\"Come Away with Me.\\"
B000094DUP|5.0|JimmyBGoode is mistaken when he says that Delta used her illness as a marketing ploy. She and Sony Music took great pains to keep news of her illness and treatments as low-key as possible.<br />As a talented, beautiful woman, she attracts media attention. The media have naturally been very interested in her story. Having Delta on covers of magazines sells lots of issues. But Delta has never actively campaigned for media attention.<br />JimmyBGoode, that review was vicious and completely uncalled for. If you want to critique music that you don't like, fine. But don't lie about a person whose moral standards are impeccable.<br />By the way, I do believe the album is brilliant.
0393964582|5.0|This Norton Critical Edition makes an excellent value in literature.  If you are a student of literature, this volume will help you gain a thorough knowledge of Mary Shelley's original text (lots of context and critical essays included), as well as editions that followed.  It contains her original preface (supposedly much influenced by Percy) as well as her 1830 preface.  If you do not know, Mary's monster is not the monster one finds in the movies, nor is Dr. Frankenstein.  Further, if you have not read an edition other than the first, you don't know about the incest issue that is in the first edition, but not later editions.  As you will find in reviews below, this is not a flawless novel, but it is a must read for any well-read person.  What is rarely discussed is the influence of John Locke, whose Essay Concerning Human Understanding Mary Shelley read closely just prior to writing the novel. The influence of his work on hers is substantial.  Read in the light of Romanticism's reaction to the Enlightenment and Locke et al gives one a completely different perspective for understanding the work.  I think you'll find Mary's philosophy appropriately and interestingly feminine, without being feminist; another surprise, considering her lineage.  Definitely a good read!
0385507755|5.0|This book is outrageous.  When I first got it I thought I had made a mistake.  Boy was I wrong.  This guy has real courage.  The first thing you read about is this loser who ends up on an airplane just covered in blood, urine, and whatever else he got into on his way there.  You know his every thought; you feel his pain; your head aches with the knowledge of all he has put himself through to all he has yet to experience.<br />I can't give anymore information but I have not been able to put this book down.  It really is a \\"must read\\" in my opinion.  Buy it or borrow it and make certain you have a day or two just to give yourself the time to relax and enjoy each page, no matter how difficult it is for YOU to read and experience it.
B00003CXCT|1.0|Like others, I was very disappointed when the special editions were released and only the special editions. Lucus has been full of cheap excuses for years, and the bottom line $$ is all he cares about. You can tell he didn't care much about the bottom line we he made the first Star Wars film, but when all the money came pouring in after the first 3 movies it's amazing how he quickly changed his tune. <br />The latest movies are good, but you can tell they were produced with one goal in mind...to squeeze the most money out of each and every one of them. Not just for ticket sales, but for toys, games, advertising, and anything else he could possibly make a buck from. Therefor it came as no surprise to me when Lucas refused to release the original versions of the trilogy. I'm sure he figured who could simply make more money with the \\"Special Editions\\".<br />What he has done now will leave the door wide open to bootleggers who will burn copies of the original from laser disc on to dvd and sell the inferior quality movies everywhere or be traded by file sharing programs. Lucas will go down in history for not only making the blunder of the century, but for his greed as well.
B000003S0D|5.0|This one out of the first four I've listened to the least, simply because up until about a week ago I'd never heard it.<BR>Well I've listened to it a few times and I do like it. It's more mellow overall than the other three (out of the first four, kind of like lounge jazz maybe? Well with a twist of course.<br />So yeah, I'll have to listen to it a bit more before I'm really comfortable with it but I think it's pretty good anyway!!
0790729652|5.0|This about a guy who's parnet's were shot down in the streets. The guy now wasnt revenge, and kills crimanal's as Batman. This is a cool film. I didn't likle the old geeky Batman comics, but that one graphic novel was cool. I liked this Batman film the best because there's no annyoing stuip Robin. Fun film to wach.
B000003S09|5.0|I'm not going to say much, other than that this album is just brilliant!!! My arm is in a lot of pain so I'm going to leave it there!!!
B000148KK2|3.0|Diana fans used to smooth her  jazz stylings  will not find it here.  Her marriage to, and writing collaboration with, Elvis Costello has resulted in twelve songs more on the hard edge of the Krall jazz style; more like something one might expect from Norah Jones.  Joni Mitchell's &quot;Black Crow&quot; is well interpreted but lacks the Mitchell intensity.  The album is well done and the production values are superb.  (What did everyone do before ProTools?)   It might be better if Miss Krall leaves Mr. Costello at home when she records her next album.
B000003S0F|5.0|The first time I heard this album I was blown away!! I was in Frank's house with him and dad, and they just put it on nice and loud!!! It tripped me out and hit me hard!! <br />I think it was &quot;The Letters&quot; that really got me hooked. Dad made sure I payed special attention to it, and when it started roaring my mouth literally dropped! And yeah...<br />Well this is my favourite KC album so I'd advise people to get it regardless of their tastes!
B0001LJCPC|5.0|However, I am unable to find, with all of my resources, one of the songs that is played during the film. The song plays after the five-point-palm exploding heart technique is performed and Bill makes his dramatic exit. It sounds like a variation of &quot;Silhouette of Doom&quot; by Ennio Morricone, but it is much more dramatic and just more amazing in general. If anyone knows a way to get this, other than waiting for it to come out on DVD and extracting the track or something, please write a response!
B000003S0B|5.0|This was the first King Crimson album I ever heard...probably when I was 13 or 14??? My dad played me his old vinyl of it because I'd been listening to a lot of Korn and he though the song \\"Porno Creep\\" sounded similar to \\"Cat Food.\\" By god it does!! Well it's a similar feel anyway.<br />Anyway that was that, but I couldn't have been bothered playing the vinyl back then so I didn't listen to KC anymore. Until finally our friend Francois leant us copies of \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\" and \\"Islands\\" and since then I've been hooked!! Well on the first four albums anyway...<br />So yeah this is just very cool and groovey to listen to so try it out it you haven't done so already!!
B00006ADFL|5.0|Recently, I was fortunate enough to have my fiance introduce me to this movie. Its one of her all time faves, but she wasnt sure if I would like it or not. Truthfully, neither was I.<br />Good LORD, I loved it.<br />Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynsky were absolutely phenomenal; the story was at once disturbing, brilliant, and cute; the scenery was breathtaking, and the direction showed that Peter Jackson was brilliant long before making LotR.<br />All in all, if you enjoy movies that make you think, you'll love this. I loved it when I saw it, but after having a while to process it, and mull it over, it's become an instant favorite.<br />This movie at times has a VERY David Lynch-type vibe to it, and as I said, will definitely make your head spin. <br />I dont think I could possibly recommend this movie more. SEE IT!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This CD is PHENOMENAL.  Idina Menzel and Kristen Chenowith are two of the most talented people I have ever listened to.  Not only is the music wonderful, but the story told through the music is amazing.  Unlike some Broadway musicals, this one is not risque or scandalous or full of curse words.  The lyrics are very clean and the music is sung VERY WELL.  And it relates to The Wizard of Oz!  WICKED is definitely on my list of top musicals ever.
B000099T2L|5.0|This album is one of the Best albums i have heard. The album is hot from beginning to end. However there were some songs that could have been better like &quot;Gift from a Virgo&quot; and &quot;Speechless&quot;. But Great Album still.... It's a grade A
B0000BYM3K|4.0|Don't get me wrong it's maiden just seems like they have ran out of ideas the good about maiden is there just damn interesting to listen <BR>to so thats what makes so fun but i expected a bit better and some more originallity on the songs  but still a buy for the maiden fans like myself.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|Gilmore Girls has an amazing storyline, about a mother and daughter relationship in a small town. Gilmore Girls shows real life and everything else. The hardships for Lorali(Graham)being a singe parent and having two parents who almost think of her as dirt. This story will touch all mothers and daughters out there!!!
B000066744|5.0|This is undoubtedly the VERY BEST and MOST BEAUTIFUL movie I have ever seen. It is a movie that, after you have seen it, you can not forget. The story and characters, and music, haunt you, and Tim Roth is unbelievably fabulous. I can not understand why this movie, Tim Roth, and the soundtrack, did not win some major awards because the movie certainly deserved best picture of the year, Tim Roth deserved best actor, and the haunting and very original soundtrack should have also received the top academy award. This movie is even better than Cinema Paridiso, which is also one of my other favorite films. I buy this movie for everyone I really like. Lucky for me that I heard about this movie only on the Netflix website and ordered it. Why did this movie never get the publicity it deserved (that is something that I would like to know from anyone out there who may know)??
0140120416|5.0|I have used several books and courses with tapes to learn Russian, and this book is one of the best. It clearly explains Russian grammar and makes a great supplement to a conversational Russian course. Growing up in Europe, I used to speak Russian as a kid. This book helped me get back into the Russian language. Russian, German and Latin are grammatically very difficult languages. It is impossible to read and write these languages without studying the grammar in depth.<BR>If you want to really learn Russian, buy this book!!
B00005KHJR|5.0|Beneath the script, there is a claustrofobic enviroment . You feel that there`s no way out. The same feeling you experienced in that fifties movie named The body snatchers.<br />The law pretends to make justice in a world who lives without knowing it. This return to the past in the mytical sense of the word makes that our private eye be less than a puppet.<br />A unforgettable given by Christopher Lee and the narrative flow makes this weird tale instales in your memory for ever.<br />Get his DVD and enjoy this film. It will let you too much worried about a lot of issues you assumed valid.
B000148KK2|4.0|This was definitely a highly anticipated release- The first studio record since The Look Of Love, and the first record containing a significant number of original compositions.  I'm not sure that any record by anybody could have lived up to the high expectations this record had, but it's very close.  The music is back to the simple trio or quartet style of the past. Her singing is more emotional and expressive than ever, probably because the music is more personal than ever.  The only serious issue I have with the record is the minimal amount of instrumental solos.  The musicians backing her are some of the best in the business, and Diana herself has a very distinctive touch to the piano; more solos would have been a definite enhancement.  Overall, it is an excellent, well-balanced record.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|sarah's music isn't like alanis, tori amos or fiona apple's.  those women constantly whine about politics and how they hate men.  sarah isn't like that at all.  she writes about music we can all relate to.  she also has a beautiful voice.
B00018D44U|4.0|I have always been confused by the categorization of Norah as a Jazz artist, and I must say this CD has done nothing to clear the confusion.  I love the voice; it's perfect for jazz. Her piano playing is clearly jazz-influenced, and her band is certainly competent and capable. The music is simply not jazz.  Having said that, I do like the music.  Norah Jones music is simply Norah Jones music- unimposing and mellow.  It's clearly all about the music instead being about the artist or the production.  Overall, this record is a bit more upbeat than Come Away With Me, but listening to one after the other does not leave you wondering what happened.  The overall style is the same; they complement each other well.  If you're a Norah Jones fan, you will probably like the record; if not, this will probably not win you over, and quite honestly, it's probably not the best place to start.  Get Come Away With Me first, listen for a while, and then try Feels Like Home.
0312995423|1.0|I'm struggling for adjectives to describe what a wreck this book is.  The plot is transparent, the technical facts are repeatedly, stupefyingly wrong, and it's written at a level that's surpassed by most schlock romance novels.<br />It's bad enough that the author confuses the number of characters in a string with the number of bits of information that string holds (clue: an ASCII character has 8 bits of information, not 1!), but he does so repeatedly and makes it an important part of the story.  <br />The central plot point is that a cryptographer has invented a new  encryption scheme, and has used the only implementation to encrypt...the only implementation.  The NSA is trying brute force key searching (guessing all possible keys) to find the decryption key, so that they can decrypt the program and learn how it works. Brute force key searching is only valuable if you already know the encryption algorithm.  Ergo, the key is worthless to them because even with it, they couldn't decrypt the secret because they didn't have an implementation of the algorithm (or even know what it was).  A classic, and unsolvable, chicken and egg problem.<br />I could go on, but I'll just say if you want to read something that won't insult your intelligence, look for something by Neal Stephenson (_Cryptonomicon_ is excellent).
B0001HAHXW|3.0|What we have here are some tasty, basically &quot;authentic&quot; generic blues arrangements that bring out the lyrics and some of the subtle, clever nuances of Robert Johnson's music.  Clapton's vocal is respectable - not the put-on fake growling Negro stuff that screwed up Up From the Cradle. And the band plays very well - seamlessly really - with him.  So it's earnest, it's respectful and it'll make a nice introduction to people who've previously been too scared by Robert Johnson's music to give it another listen.  There is no particularly interesting guitar in it, but that's okay.  I can go back to the aforementioned Up From the Cradle or any other number of mostly live Clapton albums.  My only real complaint with this release, is that it's too damned comfortable. Johnson's version of Hellhound on My Trail raises the hair on the back of my neck.  It's pure, frightening devil's music.  Clapton does it without even a hint of that stark raving fear and lust and spooky paranoia.  In other words, he makes it safe.  And that's the ultimate shortcoming of this effort.  It's all nice, safe and cleanly packaged by a nice, comfortable, wealthy white guy.  And a couple of other notes - the assumption that Robert Johnson was a solo performer is probably incorrect.  Just because his only recordings are solo doesn't mean that he performed solo throughout his short career.  And I wholeheartedly agree with the other reviewer who mentioned John Hammond Jr.  Now there's a guy who actually channels Robert Johnson in every performance - with great vocals and virtuoso guitar work that's authentic to Johnson's music in every way.  Which is why, I suppose, he's not nearly as famous as EC.
0140277447|5.0|Isn't it annoying once you know that all the negative reviews for this book are posted by the same group of people, the ignorant \\"Japanese\\"?<br />The book is a really good book. The evidences and testimony are very valid. The Japanese soldiers really conducted brutal acts against the civilians. The pictures actually show the truth for itself. Pictures of Japanese soldiers cutting off the heads of Chinese civilians and Buddhist monks. Two Japanese generals competed on who would cut the most Chinese's heads.<br />If you are an Asian, you would undoubtedly agree with Ms. Chang. The Japanese soldiers really did commit this act of atrocity in Asia (in China, Korea, Manchuria, Burma, Thailand, Vietnam). <br />To all ignorant Japanese, it does not matter how many were killed. What does matter is the way a person is being killed. Japanese soldiers during WW2 should be put on war crime and Koisumi should give apology to the Chinese, Koreans, and other Asians.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I find it interesting that most reviews that give this movie 1 star bash the movie itself, while the 5-star reviews can't really explain why they liked it; they just bash the people who didn't like the movie.  As one person so aptly explained, &quot;you need cultere&quot; (love the spelling!).<br />Some people like to equate this movie to a good foreign film, but as a lover of foreign films myself, the storytelling in this one was extremely weak compared to just about anything I've seen from offshore.  And why the high praise for the camera work -- average at best.  Also, this was NOT a comedy by any stretch of the imagination.  An all-around substandard cinema experience.
B0001LJCPC|5.0|What is the name of the song the movie starts off with while Uma is doing her monologue? I know it appears again right before she faces off with Elle Driver.
B0000WN0ZK|4.0|Watch Michelangelo Antonioni's 1966 classic &quot;Blowup&quot; in the wrong mood and you could be in for a long 111 minutes. <br />The pace is glacial, the main character is rude and cryptic and the first time I saw it, in college, the audience of talkative, frustrated students (myself included) was just about ready to riot by the time the final credits rolled. <br />But &quot;Blowup&quot; was designed to spark debate. It questions the nature of reality and critiques decadent lifestyles and, when approached with the right amount of curiosity and patience, becomes a steadily engrossing cinematic puzzle. Over the years, I've wound up seeing &quot;Blow Up&quot; about four or five times and it's only now, after many viewings and a dozen or so years beyond academia, that I'm able to appreciate the movie's puzzles.<br />David Hemmings plays a callous fashion photographer in swinging London who believes he may have snapped a picture of an unlikely murder in progress. The film follows him through one long Saturday as he enlarges the negatives looking for clues, and is diverted by all kinds of distractions - groupies, doobies, models, mimes, a mysterious femme fatale and even The Yardbirds. Has he uncovered a conspiracy? Or is he losing his mind? The movie, which plays fast and loose with the concepts of perception and time, offers no easy answers when it supplies answers at all -- which is part of its appeal and controversy. <br />It also directly inspired at least two classic thrillers (Brian DePalma's &quot;Blow-Out&quot; and Francis Coppola's &quot;The Conversation&quot;), not to mention quite a few of the gags in the &quot;Austin Powers&quot; series. <br />&quot;Blowup&quot; was finally released on DVD with great restored picture quality but a curiously hard-to-hear 1 Channel audio track.  I had to crank the volume to be able to hear the dialogue.  Even the commentary track -- an off-the-cuff analysis by Peter Brunette, Antonioni-biographer and English professor at George Mason University -- is in 2 Channel and, when he's not talking, you can hear a good sample of how this movie should've sounded.<br />There's also a &quot;music only&quot; track (which allows viewers to focus on Herbie Hancock's jazzy score) and, given that Hancock is still around and active, it's a shame he wasn't brought in to talk about the score during the gaps between cuts (much like Danny Elfman does on the excellent music-only track on &quot;Pee-wee's Big Adventure.&quot;
B000002LFU|3.0|If you look at the stock market, even during bearish times, it peaks and valleys a bit.    R.E.M.'s album quality is akin to this; none of their albums has ever been terrible.  However, there are a couple that, while still fairly good, definitely lag behind the greats this band has produced.    \\"Green\\" is one of those.  While I think I'd actually give the album 3.5 stars rather than just three, I'd say that \\"Green\\" represents a dip between \\"Document\\" and \\"Out of Time.\\"  It certainly has a few great songs, my favorite being Orange Crush, a song that holds up very well to this day.    But the quality of the album is uneven.  There are few songs on \\"Green\\" that really don't move me one way or other, which is unusual when it comes to R.E.M., even after hearing them quite a few times.   Also, I agree with those who've said the pacing of the album is odd -- I don't really like the interspersing of slow with up tempo here.  You get picked up by the faster songs to be brought down just to be brought up again right away.     Since R.E.M. has set such high standards for itself, \\"Green\\" can come across as a disappointment in some ways.  Yet it is hardly a bad album (it beats quite a few other bands' best efforts) and it does give hints of what's yet to come in subsequent R.E.M. albums.
B0000TG9E2|4.0|This is another great Disney movie. It's one of my other favorites. Alice in Wonderland is a great adventure for the whole family. It's really great to watch as many times as you want. I highly recommend it.
B000062YB1|5.0|Slayer is one of the best heavy metal bands, and it truly shows in this album. abyss is ass heavy as j.lo's ass when soaking wet....yes its that heavy, so this is a definite must buy, no mistake. slayer is one of the top metal acts ever next to pantera!
B00003CX8Y|5.0|This is a beautiful movie and is in a wonderful set. It has two discs with great behind the scenes stuff for Beauty and the Beast that you definitely wont want to miss out on.<BR>The colors in this movie is beautiful and the music is lovely.<BR>I really wouldn't miss out on this movie because it's a great film and a wonderful set.
B000002NC4|5.0|I just recently got into some indie music ala Modest Mouse.  My friend got this album and I listened to it for a little while.  My god this album is freaking awesome.  Long, melodic, beautiful songs.  Not only do the instrumental aspects of the music rule, but the lyrical content is also very good.  This is the kind of album that you put on and listen to in its entirety.  What a trip, I love it.  If you like Modest Mouse, even just a little, or any other indie band for that matter, it is mandatory that you check these guys out.  If you are sick of listening to the songs on the radio, check this out.  This album is very near perfect, and if it is any indication of what to expect from Built to Spill in the future, then they will be perfect from now on (no pun intended of course, ya right).
B000094DUP|5.0|i've owned innocent eyes for over a year now and i still havent got sick of it! delta has a powerful beautiful voice and her songs are all so meaningful. my fave songs would have to be innocent eyes and born to try they are just outstanding! if u dont own a copy of this excellent album i urge u to buy a copy its definately worth the money :)
1401300901|2.0|Interesting premise, lousy book.  I &quot;slogged&quot; through this book waiting for it to get better.  It didn't.  The book was disjointed, and the characters were underdeveloped.  The author spent a lot of time &quot;telling&quot; and not &quot;showing.&quot; The dialogue was amateurish.  I started counting how many times the word sarcastically was used to describe a conversation. Too bad.  With a little polish, this could have been a great book.
B000094DUP|5.0|This a great album by an artist who will only grow and grow. Delta adds a new dimension and a new sound that the charts haven't seen for a long time
B00006LWSF|4.0|I'll start off buy saying this is not Shady Records best work,This is not even Eminem's best work, but take into account that this a soundtrack and most soundtracks are terrible. All eminem's tracks rock on this, he  should have taken out anything that was not rap though, the tracks can get repetive just because of eminem's beat producing style. Other than that this is an awsome CD, I was glad to see he didn't go Shady Reords all the way and got some other artists in this
0618526412|3.0|This novel is a profound and powerful work of undoubted literary quality.  It's characters are sharply drawn and believable, and the portrait of life in the town that they inhabit realistic and strong.  It's amazing to consider that the author was only 23 when this book was first published.  It's an amazing achievement.<br />And I detested it.<br />It's stupifyingly depressing.  The characters, almost without exception, lead sad, desparate lives with little chance for happiness.  It takes place in a time and a location that not only am I not familiar with, I can't identify with in the least.  Perhaps it helps if one is from the South, or is from a rural environment, or grew up in the earlier part of the last century, or is (maybe) a woman.  I don't know; I'm a late-20th Century urban Yankee, and I couldn't related to it at all.<br />Many people complain that not all movies nor novels should have happy endings.  Life isn't that way, they say; why should fiction?  Perhaps I am a philistine, but I feel that that is *exactly* why I want my fiction to end (more or less) happily.  Life *is* difficult and a struggle, and I do not need to bring more depression, lonliness, sadness, and struggle into it by seeking it out in fiction.  Read the editorial reviews above:  the book is about &quot;the damned, the voiceless, the  rejected.&quot;  It &quot;takes us on shattering  voyages into the depths of the spiritual isolation  that underlies the human condition.&quot;<br />That may be your cup of tea, but it is most certainly not mine.  I found this book astonishingly depressing.  I will never read it again.  Which in no way detracts from my very real appreciation of its literary qualities and the superb writing.<br />How can one balance out those two conflicting feelings?  I gave it three stars, because that's the best I can do.  Judge for yourself if you want to go on the &quot;shattering voyage,&quot; and make your purchasing choice accordingly.
B00004Z459|1.0|I admit it. I own this CD. I listened to it. In fact, I used to worship these guys as gods. Oh how clueless and uninformed I was...<BR>Linkin Park and the many MTV clones running around serve no purpose at all, other than to sell as many records as possible. 'Whats wrong with that?' you might ask? Well, I and many other people, musicians and fans alike consider music to be more about emotions and talent than money. Linkin Park and their many clones (this current period in music should be called 'Attack of the Clones', after a similarly crappy movie) serve no purpose emotionally. They try to sound angry, but they can't really pull it off. Sure, they scream, but as so many people have forgotten, music isn't all about vocals. Their guitars, 'bass' (no bass player during the recording of this album) and drumming are so simplistic and repetitive they serve no purpose at all. They aren't brutal, they aren't crunchy, they only seem to be there to fill in between vocals. Which leads me to the formula to this album. Every song is exactly the same; Dj intro, short guitar riff, followed by vocals. The combination of rap and rock is done very poorly, as in most bands. Either listen to metal or rap. Don't try to mix them, it sounds horrible. <BR>To put it simply, if you want metal, listen to Slayer, Cryptopsy or Opeth<BR>If you want to listen to rap, then go back to your MTV worshipping<BR>and if you want Rap/Rock, then listen to Rage Against The Machine, the only band to pull this off sucessfully<BR> The only good thing that can come from this CD is that it may be able to start some people down the path to real metal.

B00008OLYN|5.0|Damnation is Opeth's &quot;mellow album&quot; that was spoken of a lot during the release of their previous disc Deliverance. When plans to release both discs at the same time failed, Damnation was released separately which was a wise move in my opinion. Reason being, if it had come out as a double album it would have gotten compared to the heavier album way too much and also it would have been a bit difficult to listen to the album at one go. As a separate release, Damnation stands on its own and has its own traits. And, that's definitely what it deserves.<br />This is a different Opeth album. It is also most likely going to stay that way as Mike Akerfeldt has pointed out several times that, in the future, they are going to explore different directions incorporating both their heavy death metal roots and the softer moments. The album is mostly acoustic and demonstrates Opeth's softer sides without ever relying on their heavier and more aggressive style. Hence, the originality and uniqueness of Damnation. For so long I always wondered what it would sound like if Opeth did an all acoustic record with Mike's almost angelic clean vocals, I always believed it would draw a lot of fans' attention, including those who do not listen to metal but only the late-60's and early-70's psychedelic and progressive rock releases. On Damnation, Opeth delivers its earlier 70's roots utilizing mellotrons and post-psychedelic atmospherics of bands like Camel, Yes and King Crimson. Some of the songs like &quot;In My Time of Need&quot; even employ similar production techniques thanks to Steven Wilson that is reminiscent of the old 70's LPs.<br />Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree is once again at the helm of production and needless to say he's done a flawless job. It feels like he and the Opeth guys understand each other perfectly. Although the tunes are still penned by Mikael himself, the final touches of Steven Wilson are undeniable. Apparently the mellotron work and some of the atmospheric keyboard textures are his creations. As Opeth has a specific sound that is immediately recognisable, this advantage is taken to a higher level of sophistication with Wilson's awesome production job.<br />Damnation sees Opeth experimenting a bit further with vocal harmonies and arrangements. They have found a unique sound for every single tune yet managed to maintain the almost perfect unity all throughout the entire disc. The lyrics are mostly inspired from loneliness, despair, regret and depression caused by the end of a relationship. Needless to say they come across as deeply moving and heartfelt. The songs earn their dark tone not just through regular keyboards and synths, but moreso through Floydan guitar work that is layered as a warm texture on the compositions. In &quot;Closure&quot; some people may get the misconception that this is just one of those typical goth tracks with heavy keyboard work thrown in... well it's not. There's not a single keyboard work in there! It's the looped guitars that are playing notes next to each other without getting the least bit forced. The album consists of a culmination of incredible moments of beauty and brutality. Mike has a great voice for melodic singing. He sounds deeply emotive and affecting, and the overall vibe of the songwriting seems very natural and spontaneous. It's like they've all opened their doors and let whatever's inside flow out. I am fully convinced that this is one of those albums that only the Opeth guys could have pulled off. It's indiscribably beautiful yet still very dark, intense and moving.<br />This may not be the best starting point to get into Opeth, but it has already taken its place in their never-disappointing catalog. Here's a band that has yet to do something that I do not appreciate and Damnation actually ranks very high in my favourite Opeth discs.ic keyboard textures are his creations.

0060512806|5.0|Last year I read and enjoyed Neal Stephenson's Diamond Age, but was left dissatisfied by the abrupt ending. It was clear to me that Stephenson was something of a genius, with an exceptional grasp not only of science and technology, but also history, politics, anthropology and sociology. I was also struck by his sheer literary talent--mind-boggling creativity and a wicked sense of humor coupled with an ability to create memorable and engaging characters. Diamond Age failed, however, to provide a conclusion that properly brought together all the threads of the complex plot and to tell the reader what happened to all the main characters. <br />Cryptonomicon is a better book because Stephenson manages to match or even improve upon the strengths of Diamond Age while providing a more satisfying conclusion. It is difficult to summarize a book of this scope, which comes close to a thousand pages and follows a large cast of characters through two pivotal periods of modern history: World War II and the information revolution of the 1990s. Stephenson's book makes most of Charles Dickens' works look spare by comparison.<br />As indicated by the title, the book's central focus is cryptography and the role of computers in both processing and concealing information. Stephenson describes a fascinating crew of fictional characters, from hackers and nerds to Navy SEALS and leathernecks, who interact with the likes of Douglas MacArthur and Alan Turing to show the importance not only of military and economic might, but also the use and control of information, in determining the destiny of nations and the course of world history.<br />No book is perfect, however. Stephenson has a unique authorial voice: breezy, conversational, and definitely never dull, whether he is describing the intricacies of cryptography or a bloody marine landing on a Pacific island. Yet the blunt, colloquial style of writing may not appeal to readers who prefer more elegant, refined prose. (Stephenson's characters don't make love, they f*ck, for example, and Stephenson pulls no punches when describing bodily functions that some people would rather just be left to imagine themselves--or not think aobut at all). I didn't mind it, but I'm sure many others will. What did irk me was that many of the characters (particularly the American hackers of the 1990s) speak and write in almost exactly the same tone, use exactly the same vocabulary, and ruminate on exactly the same subjects as Stephenson himself. In some cases, even characters like Enoch Root, an enigmatic and apparently ageless ex-Catholic priest, also fall into an identical style of speech. While this does lend the book a certain stylistic unity, it also sometimes makes it difficult for the reader to suspend disbelief and to distinguish the characters' viewpoints from those of the author himself.<br />Ultimately, though, any criticism of this book pales in comparison with its immense achievements. No review can do justice to the genius of the Cryptonomicon--it transcends genres and is one of the few books that really deserves the overused adjectives &quot;unique&quot; and &quot;original&quot;. Read it!

These are great songs, of course, but they're performed exactly the same way as on the albums (some with a faster beat)and there's  really no reason to own them over the originals; in fact, just get those instead. Be sure to listen to several tracks first if you're interested in buying.
B0000648WZ|5.0|There's been enough written about the surpassingly excellent technical aspects of the film as to render further comments redundant. S.T. is a terrific film, engrossing from first to last. The film veers far away from its source, and I do wonder how many among its audience have actually read the Heinlein novel upon which it is based. The film gives short shrift to the premise of the book, which was doubtless necessary to take the film in the direction Verhoeven wished to go. The book's provocative basic point is that the rights to take full part in society (voting, etc.) can and should only belong to those have put their lives on the line in service to their country; a citizen serves, a civilian does not. A civilian has all rights to make as much money as they like, but as one who has paid no price for freedom, they cannot possibly appreciate it, and therefore cannot become a citizen and take part in engineering the various aspects of their society. Had Verhoeven emphasized this, it would have been a very different film, and probably a less popular one, if intellectually more challenging.<br />As it is, Verhoeven's imposing of WWII style recruitment propaganda is an effective framing device, though the recruits' reasons for joining are superficial, amounting to parental rebellion, joining to get the girl or going to Harvard. All of which misrepresent the book's tenets.<br />Yet, when a film is this great, why argue about this or that. This is one for the ages.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Ok, I'll admit, I was a little doubtful at first. I didn't get what direction it was going. But at the end, I realized that the climax I was waiting for wasn't going to happen. This movie is definetly not plot driven. And it's not suppose to be. I watched it again and absolutely loved it. It's artsy and well written with good acting and directing. If you want a good, meaningful film, rent Lost in Translation.

B000002H6C|5.0|From the slow, lamentful drumbeats that introduce &quot;One&quot; to the crashing anger of &quot;Harvester of Sorrow&quot; this album showcases the most innovative metal band of all time at their best.  The album starts out with the relatively tame &quot;Blackened&quot; which, although the lyrics are strong, feels too long and could have more interesting guitars. My personal favorite is &quot;One&quot; not so much because of the music, although it's the usual high quality Metallica stuff, but rather because it perfectly encapsulates everything that an album with the name &quot;...And Justice For All&quot; should.
0743454529|3.0|I could not put this book down.  It even brought me to tears a few times!  But, it proves overly dramatic and disappointing.  I wish someone had told me not to read it.  I wish the author had stuck to one story, too.  Oh well.  You'll probably read it anyway ;)
B000002OR4|5.0|I give this soundtrack 4 1/2 stars. Occasionally a few of the tracks that worked excellently with the movie and weaved the right atmsophere, are somewhat bland when listened to apart from the film, for example the long piece &quot;Schindler's Workforce&quot;. But this is only a minor criticism that should not be emphasized. As a whole, this is a super piece of work from the greatest living composer today, John Williams, who gave us the musical themes of ET, Superman, Star Wars, and countless other tunes that we've all heard and loved. My favorite piece on this &quot;Schildler's List&quot; soundtrack is the memorable and sad opening theme.  It's a little classic. <br />David Rehak<BR>author of &quot;Poems From My Bleeding Heart&quot;
B00007KQA3|5.0|This movie/DVD captures the spirit of Orwell's novel more perfectly than almost any movie I have ever seen that was derived from a book.  The film perfectly captures the sense of dispair, the dingy physical lives of the people, the omnipresence of a malevolent Government, all of which constitute the main theme of the story.<br />William Hurt turns in quite literally a perfect performance as Winston Smith, the main protagonist of the story.  The cinamatography of the film is brilliant, and perfectly captures the dingy, ratty existence of life in the ultimate totalitarian/socialist state.  The constant background harangue of the Party via the telescreens is perfectly done.  If Orwell had lived to see this film I believe that he would find little or nothing to criticize.  It brilliantly captures the novel for the silver screen.<br />Without giving anything away, this is the story of one Winston Smith, a citizen of &quot;Oceania&quot; which is one of three superstates that dominate the world.  (Oceania is comprised of Britain, the Americas, and Australasia; its adversaries Eurasia and Eastasia are of similar size and power).  The Government dominates and controls everything through the &quot;Party&quot; which promotes the doctrine &quot;Ingsoc&quot; (derived from &quot;English Socialism&quot;).  Everyone, even the elite, live in a ramshackle dingy world in which shortages of everything is the norm--it is a world in which &quot;nothing is cheap and plentiful.&quot;  (Basically your socialist state taken to the nth degree).  Winston works in a pointless job that involves constantly re-writing old archives to conform to present &quot;realities&quot; as defined by the Party.  Love is forbidden other than love of the Party and its leader (&quot;Big Brother&quot;) and the &quot;Thought Police&quot; ruthlessly root out anyone who fails to conform to the requirement of strict orthodoxy and Party loyalty.  The fact that Winston is such a one is the central theme to the story.  When he falls in love with a beautiful young woman, his troubles begin in earnest.<br />To properly appreciate this film, the viewer should of course first read the book.  I would imagine that the film would be somewhat bewildering to one who was not familiar at least with the novel's basic theme and premise--the dispair of life under the ultimate totalitarian state.<br />This is not a film for the whole family to enjoy together.  It is intense and depressing.  The final portion of the movie, involving Winston Smith and O'Brian (Richard Burton in his final role) is long, unhappy, and downright dreary.  Although utterly necessary as an essential component of the story, it both drags and depresses.<br />1984 is essentially the story of the ultimate result of allowing Government (any Government) to run our lives, and what will happen if the people substitute trust in Big Government for the love of liberty and freedom.When he falls in love with a beautiful young woman, his troubles begin in earnest.<br />To properly appreciate this film, the viewer should of course first read the book.

B00005Y7L4|5.0|I saw this film after having it reccomended to me by my friend. And Seeing The Lovely Chiaki Kuriyama in Kill bill vol.1 I was interested to see her in another role. Her Role as Chigusa while small is very well acted. And over all the acting in the whole movie is very impressive. And the shocking subject matter is handled very well. So If you can manage to get a copy of this I highly reccommend you watch it. Its a very good movie. The thing i found amazing about this movie was that they still manage to make you care for these charcters after only a little charcter developement. I just hope one day this movie gets released in north america on dvd. but please no dub...

B000021Y7X|5.0|According to the commentary track included with this DVD, David Byrne may be considered to be the central character in this Talking Heads concert documentary.  In the course of the film's 90 minute duration, he is transformed as \\"a stiff white guy who sheds his inhibitions, gets loose and lets go.  He is both changed by the music and set free.\\"<br /><br />The concert starts on a bare 60 by 40 foot stage with a solo performance of \\"Psycho Killer\\" and then slowly adds both equipment and musicians during the first five songs.  By the sixth song, \\"Burning Down the House\\", nine musicians are present and will remain fully engaged for the next 10 tracks. Three additional tracks are included on the DVD as a bonus.<br /><br />Seven cameras were used to record the performance, with much of the footage being shot from the perspective of the audience. Indeed, the viewer of the documentary is made to feel that they are actually witnessing a live event.  The director takes great pains to record the artists not just as musicians, but also as \\"characters\\" with their own individual performance personalities.<br /><br />The stage is lit solely by white lighting, with both the type and positioning of the lights permitting an amazing visual variation.  Backlit slide photography of both text and representational images are sometimes used in the stage design as well.<br /><br />The title, \\"Stop Making Sense\\", refers to David Byrne's approach to writing song lyrics during the early 1980's. His lyrics are often irrational and illogical, not making sense from one line to the next, yet they still tend to remain both intuitive and emotionally involving.<br /><br />\\"Stop Making Sense\\" is resplendent in its entertaining divergence from the commonplace.  Watch, listen and be moved by its wonderfully liberating creative energy!

Though Ms. Jones's voice is adequate, and the band is good nothing reached out and grabbed me with a \\"hey, pay attention,\\" energy, or even riff.<br />\\"Feels Like Home,\\" feels like fine background music - if you like that sort of thing - or rainy day take-a-nap music, but I don't think it's going to get many spins out of me.
0452282152|4.0|When her father is blinded in an accident and no longer able to support his family, 16-year-old Griet is hired as a maid by the painter Vermeer and his jealous, egocentric, and frequently pregnant wife. Griet's responsibilities in the house are legion, and her tasks rendered more difficult by the unkindness of several of her new home's inhabitants. When Vermeer adopts her as an assistant in his studio--and subsequently determines to paint her--interpersonal relations below stairs are only worsened.<br /><br />Tracy Chevalier has written a believable and moving account--or imagining--of the creation of Vermeer's \\"Girl with a Pearl Earring,\\" the painting which graces the cover of the paperback. The genius of the book lies in Chevalier's investing the act of painting Griet with a dark significance one would not imagine it to possess. There is in Griet's modeling for Vermeer the potential for tragedy, and in the painter's final brushstrokes a form of abuse. Communicating this significance to readers--and imagining this history of the painting in the first place--is quite an accomplishment.<br /><br />Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I never watched it when it was on TV since it was bounced around so much. I only just now started watching it when a friend lent me one of the DVDs. I am a big fan of Deep Space 9 and it has taken a long time to find a new show that has drawn me in as much as DS9 did.<br />This show is a refreshing change to SciFi TV. Everytime I anticipate a Star Trek ending, I don't receive one- which is good. It makes the show harder to predict.<br />Reasons I like the show so much:<br />1. It has great character development, the actors seem to really synch well with each other, and their backstory is actually interesting.<br />2. I have always enjoyed video games from the space privateer genre. This show depicts that just right. I wish more modern video games like Freelancer had more of this feel.<br />3. I like the off-world sets. THey feel like something out of blade runner. Every environment seems to make you want to go out and explore it.

B0000648WZ|5.0|At front value this is a Sci-Fi film with a high violence and special effect quota. \\"Starship Troopers\\" encompasses blends of \\"Full Metal Jacket\\", \\"Platoon\\" and \\"Robocop\\", and while the story in itself is nothing very new (young graduates join the army in a futuristic fascist governmetn and get involved in a useless war at the far end of the galaxy) it carries some very dark undertones. Apart from hardly ignorable hints at Nazi Germany (The secret service uniforms are almost identical save a swastica, not to mention the fixation on militarist and racist issues), the film shows the effect of propaganda in war campaigns when battling far-away countries. This film was made long before 9/11, however, it gives rise to very worrying thoughts as to our problems in this day and age. <BR>As Mr. Bush held his speaches on 9/11 and then went on to start a war on an enemy that cannot be defeated in combat, aided by a wide-spread propaganda campaign on almost all tv-channels, I couldn't help thinking of \\"Starship Troopers\\", where the alien bugs answer the human colonisation attempt in their space by wiping out the colony and shooting an asteroid at earth, eradicating Buenos Aires. Human soldiers are sent to literally the other end of the galaxy, at immense cost of lives and resources, to a hostile desert planet, effectively to die for nothing.... ring any bells? This film carries a subversive message about american culture as it stands today. <BR>Anyone who likes war movies, sci fi flicks or would like to see the downside of american culture taken to the extreme, buy this DvD!
0671027344|5.0|Some people might see Charlie's life too dramatic or fake. And I guess I understand that. But one of the things I really came to respect about this book and Chbosky's style of writing, is that he doesn't try to impress anyone by using big words and complicated sentences and modern witty banter. The words are real, the language is real, the issues are real. A few pages into the book I felt painfully sympathetic towards the main character Charlie; his almost eerie, impossible sense of innocence and naiveness. <BR>This book is about heartbreak and betrayal, and god kill me for my unoriginality, but coming of age. Charlie charms new friends with his naive charm, breaking their hearts with his sincerity and a haunting reminder of their own inpurities. And Charlie has a few physchologically damaging dark secrets of his own to overcome through his letters to an unnamed someone throughout the novel.

I felt as if I was on the boat with him!  The story left me emotionally drained yet thoroughly satisfied.  The descriptions of the animals, their behaviors and interactions with Pi were detailed and horrific.  The gruesome parts were upsetting and haunting, but I believe, critical to the story. So much symbolism.  Patel's ending make the reader an active part of this story by forcing us to draw upon our personal beliefs and faith to render our own conclusion.  Thank you and BRAVO!

1400031362|5.0|Third in the series of the No. 1 Ladies' Detection Agency, a person could pick this up and read it on its own.  But I don't recommend it.  I feel everyone would enjoy this book FAR more after reading the first two books in the series.  <br />As good as the first two books were, each book only seems to get better!   I couldn't put the book down, and read the whole thing in one day.  Unlike some U.S. reviewers, I did not find this book to be weak.  I found the fact that some cases/plots resolve more satisfactorily than others to be a mirror of REALITY.  (I am an American living overseas, and have often heard British/Australians/New Zealanders criticise American movies/books for having endings that are \\"too pat,\\" with too many ends tied up TOO well!  Perhaps those who criticise this book about the the opposite are more used to American authors.  I think part of what they are feeling is that this is a British author.)<br />As all books do in series, different books focus more on certain characters, to the exclusion of others.  Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni is somewhat on the sidelines in this book, but he does come back into prominence in the successive books (and in fact, book five seems to be primarily about him).<br />The title of this book comes from a particularly interesting case Mma Makutsi investigates while Precious Ramotswe is away investigating another particulary interesting case.  The best thing about the book is the way these two cases resolve!  I feel this writer has had a lot of life experience, and ends up imparting this wisdom about life through his characters adventures and investigations.  Furthermore, living in Africa these past 12 years, I absolutely love the African settings and how the African people of Botswana are portrayed.
020161622X|5.0|For the last year in two different companies I have been evangelizing many of the concepts in &quot;Pragmatic Programmer&quot;, but had a hard time validating my thoughts to the more skeptical people in our group.<br />That's over now.  &quot;Pragmatic Programmer&quot; has given me not only the ammunition I need to wage war against some of the more Philistine ideas that I must deal with, it has added to my thoughts and made me a better leader, better communicator and a much, much better developer.  Any book that tells you to step away from the keyboard before you begin is good, but this book is a masterpiece because it tells you WHY you should take a step back.<br />Every chapter is a gem and stands alone, but taken together with the references and extremely well-written explanations, it almosts reads like a novel.  I felt guilty putting it down!<br />If you are serious about software, serious about becoming a real craftsman and a leader in your field, then this book needs to be on your shelf, dog-eared and used.
140003180X|5.0|Even though this book is the fourth in the series about the No. 1 Ladies' Detection Agency, it could easily be picked up and read, not having read the previous three books.  The reason is that the author starts the book by giving a good summary, in several pages, of  the most important points of the previous books.  As good as each book in the series has been, it seems as if every new book is even better!<br />This book imparts the wisdom of experience through the characters.  I actually cried with the characters when they cried.  This book finds Precious Ramotswe still unmarried, and Mma Makutsi starting a typing school, and with a boyfriend.  The cases taken on are as interesting as always, and their resolutions impart wisdom to the reader.  This book left me immediately eager to pick up the fifth book in the series.

B0000TAZBK|5.0|I bought this collection and was astounded by the music. Howard Shore is true genius. The range of emotions, the orchestration, the themes, it is overwhelmingly beautiful. These scores include some of the most beautiful pieces of music I have ever heard; like 'Concerning Hobbits', 'The Breaking of the Feelowship', 'The King In the Golden Hall' or 'The Return of the King'. I recommend this set to all Score collectors or Lord of the Rings fans.
B0001HLVS2|4.0|I thought this was one of the best movies of 2003.  I can't imagine how Peter Weir (and the studio) resisted dumbing down of this movie to make it more appealing to average movie goers, but I am glad they did.  This was what made it so great. I felt totally immersed in the way of life in the early 19th century Royal Navy.  In addition I like it when the director doesn't add in a love story into a situation where it is very unnecessary as was the case with this movie.<br />There is a glaring problem with the DVD though.  There are no extras! About the only thing that was extra was the ability to watch it with English subtitles (that was actually cool since I saw a lot of dialogue I was missing in the theatre).  The cruelest thing was the \\"Inside Look\\" option.  I couldn't wait to check it out.  Imagine my dismay to find that it was merely previews for upcoming movies. <br />Hence, I have to give a 4 star DVD rating to a 5 star movie.
B000000WA4|5.0|Not many albums leave me with as many conflicting emotions as this one.  I love a great deal of the songs on &quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&quot;, but I can't stand a good number as well.  However, the feeling I have when I have completed the album is like no other.  I always feel like I have just taken a magnificant and long journey.  <br />Overall, I like the melodic songs better than the hard rockers, but there are a few exceptions.  My favorite soft songs include &quot;Tonight, Tonight&quot;, &quot;Cupid de Locke&quot;, &quot;Porcelina of the Vast Oceans&quot;, &quot;Take Me Down&quot;, &quot;1979&quot;, &quot;Thru the Eys of Ruby&quot;, &quot;We Only Come Out at Night&quot; and &quot;Lily (My One and Only)&quot;.  I do also like many of the rockers, including &quot;Zero&quot;, &quot;Bullet with Butterfly Wings&quot;, &quot;Muzzle&quot;, and &quot;XYU&quot;.  <br />However, my least favorite song of all time is the awful &quot;Tales of a Scorched Earth&quot;.  When I listened to it (I skip it now) I used to think, I thought the Smashing Pumpkins were an ALTERNATIVE band.  When did they decide to try to be hard core metal?  The song does not work.  <br />That misstep aside, &quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&quot; is a gem of an album, a breathtaking musical experience and an amazing double album.  Buy it.  You won't be disappointed.
B000148KK2|1.0|I would like to tell you about Diana's music, but I can't play the CD on my computer unless I go to her website and register for her fan club--that's wrong! Why should I have to give out my personal information (email address, etc.) to listen to a CD that I purchased? If I give out my info, at least give me the CD for free! This is ridiculous. My advice: don't buy the CD.
B00006CXXU|3.0|Christina's first shot at revealing her musical tastes and lyrical abilities, it's actually pretty well done. Its got some latin (Infatuation), hip hop (Can't Hold Us Down), funk (Underappreciated, Get Mine, Get Yours), soul (Soar, Impossible), and rock (Make Over, Fighter).<br />High Points: In my opinion the arrangement of the songs is great, it rolls along nice and smooth. Each song has it's own flavor, and could probably suit any mood your in. My favorites are Cruz (inspirational ballad about letting go and accepting what the future has to offer), I'm Okay (hauntingly melodic song, Christina's releasing some childhood demons), and Dirrty (I never thought I'd like this song, but you gotta take it with a grain of salt).<br />Low Points: The girl can sing, but a lot of times not in a good way. I can't comprehend how she can shout like that (and mind you she does shout a lot), it sounds like she's trying to tear a hole in her throat. And the &quot;oaoaoaoa&quot; moments can go to the point of being comical. Least favorite songs are Make Over (I dig the beat, but her collaboration with Linda Perry kinda blows here), Get Mine, Get Yours (again, I love the beat but the message is wack. Beware of STD's Christina), and Impossible (STOP RUINING THE SONG WITH YOUR SCREAMING!)<br />In my opinion it's worth a listen and although it may not be a &quot;masterpiece&quot;, it's not a piece of sh__t either. Out.
B000000OQF|5.0|What can I say, this is one of the best albums ever made, selling over 15 million copies in the U.S. alone. The highest selling debut album of all time. This is one of those rare albums where you can listen through the entire cd without skipping over songs. This cd has many of GN'R's famous hits, like &quot;Welcome to the Jungle,&quot; &quot;Paradise City,&quot; and &quot;Sweet Child O' Mine.&quot; However,the other songs are awesome hits as well. Track #2 &quot;Its So Easy&quot; is a thundering metal song, filled with that GN'R attitude. One of my personal favorites is track #3 &quot;Night Train.&quot; Its got a good groove, and one of the best and most difficult guitar solos on the album. Finally, my last personal favorite on the album is &quot;Rocket Queen.&quot; Its six minutes of heavy grooving and GNR attitude. This is a must album for any rock fan, especially those guitar players.
B0001Z363W|4.0|I knew this was going to be a mellower effort, so I wasn't surprised when I bought it. When I first heard the cd I wasn't that impressed, I figured &quot;it's ok&quot; and that I'd listen to it sparingly. But a couple of days later the chorus of &quot;Queen of Sorrow&quot; just popped into my head, this after hearing it only once. So I started listening closer, and I've got to say if you liked Book of Shadows you'll like this. I like it even more. I don't really get a sense of the Pride&amp;Glory influence some have eluded to. I do hear an Alice in Chains kind of feel in some songs. &quot;Layne&quot; of course is one , but even &quot;Crazy or high&quot;, the beggining guitar part reminds of &quot;Down in a hole&quot;. BLS always has some mellower stuff on their cd's, the last 3 tracks of Blessed Hellride aren't particularly ball stompin metal. Look at &quot;Spoke in the wheel&quot; on Sonic that is a kick ass song but slow. BLS attracts a wide variety of listeners I'm in my 30's and wear BLS colors (in-laws think little of it,but hey F*** em!). So we should all be used to these types of songs from Zakk &amp; Co. Having said that, I don't think we'll be hearing these songs in concert. &quot;No other&quot; is a tune I think has potential too be a great rocking tune if it's &quot;juiceified&quot; with some distortion. Maybe he's planning that, after all we do have different versions of &quot;Peddlers of death&quot;, and &quot;Beggining at last&quot;. Any true BLS fan has to have this cd (not only for the music) but if no one buys it, then no one will want to sign them to a lucrative new contract, seeing that they've fufilled their contract with Spitfire with this release. The good news is people are buying this CD, the bad news is BLS is now a top 40 band. The CD debuted in the 30's on the billboard charts. Bleedin Black Label Forever !!!
0066620996|5.0|Good to Great is a Gr-reat book for all business types. It is very well researched and shows how companies achieved double digit growth.<br />If your in business and interested in double digit growth, then I highly recommend this book.
0920668372|5.0|I found this book as an adult.  I was looking for a gift for my<BR>Grandmother who was blind at the end of her life and I used to read it to her most evenings before bed.  Eventhough the pictures really tell the story, she got the message about love.  Every parent should own this book and read it to their children!
B00005JLSE|1.0|Its bad, i loved the cast and thought it'd be great but the director must've been high when he made this piece of crap. Same goes for the academy when they gave an oscar to both the cast and the movie. Still thought that Seabiscuit should've won. 2.5/10.
B000058983|5.0|Instead of reviewing this album directly, something which the majority of contributers here have done magnificiently, I will attempt to highlight why it deserves its place as my all-time number one album by briefly commenting on some of its peers. Please note that I am in no way slamming these other great albums .. I deeply enjoy them but they just fall short when compared to Forever Changes:<br />Sgt Pepper's - The one that started off as an all-time favourite. Its strength lies in its seemingly conceptual nature and progressive production techniques. However, just as the Beatles hid under the guise of Sgt. Pepper's Band, the album didn't portray their innermost selves and hence suffered as a result of not having enough depth. If only they had followed their initial decision to write an album of songs about their childhood and included Strawberry Fields and Penny Lane.<br />Revolver - The album that most critics prefer now (used to be Sgt Pepper's). It is an eclectic collection of styles and is a treasure trove of great songs. Alas, believe me when I say that they should have stretched this into a double album (just imagine including all the songs of Rubber Soul (omitting What Goes On and Run For Your Life) and the four songs that were singles at that time (Day Tripper/We Can Work It Out and Paperback Writer/Rain) and they would have the best (double) album of all time (they tried the double with the White Album but it had several weak tracks, most notably Revolution 9). <br />Pet Sounds - Brian Wilson's masterpiece could have been the greatest if he didn't bow to the pressure from the label to include the previously released hit single Sloop John B. This track does not belong in Pet Sounds; it was not written by Brian and it does not share the same melancholy of the other tracks (even the two instrumentals fare much better). What a miss!<br />Highway 61 Revisited - A much more consistent album than its successor, the double Blonde On Blonde. This one rocks hard and is a great listen from start to finish; it's great for the mind and feet but lacking a little of heart.<br />Dark Side Of The Moon - The progressive album with phenomenal sales and recognition that Forever Changes should have had. Frankly, there isn't much to fault with this album. It is near perfect in its production as well as in its subject matter of alienation and mental disorder; the title says it all but not all of the human condition is from the Dark Side.<br />Rumours - This one wins over the listeners more than it does the critics; to most of the latter, anything that commercially successful has got to be frowned upon. I do think that it is a great collection of songs inspired by the real life romantic liaisons within the band. Like Dark Side Of The Moon, it just focuses on one aspect of the human condition. <br />Well, these are some of the widely acknowledged great albums .. if you haven't gathered, I value consistency, unity, and variety in an album. If an album is unified enough (along a single theme or concept), it doesn't need to be too long (a single album will suffice); if it is eclectic, it would be better served by being a double album. The album also has to affect all aspects of my being; mind, body and soul (or heart). That is why Forever Changes rules forever! That is also why, as other reviewers have pointed out, the album should be heard without the bonus tracks (good as some of them are) in one sitting.
0800130227|5.0|This is a great must see family comedy about an orphan who has magical powers and uses it for good stuff and at the same time brews up some slapstick comedy fun, a great cast including Danny Devito as actor and narrator for this great family movie and a tale of a smart and gifted young child you'll never forget, i'm sure you'll love it. 10/10.
B0000020C4|5.0|The quality, emotion, and energy is all here! If you're to get only ONE Les Miserables soundtrack, get this! Lea Salonga will definitely capture you hearts with her renditions of &quot;On My Own&quot; and &quot;A Little Fall Of Rain&quot;. And though a lot of people might disagree, Michael McGuire does an EXCELLENT job portraying Enjolras. His rasp, sharp voice justifies his role as the brave leader. <br />If I could give this a ten, I would.
0792164903|4.0|This movie is too gritty and very violent, based in those middle ages where the Headless Horseman strikes terror into a small town, the tale is realistic and this movie will give you the chills, Jonny Deep and Christina Ricci are both great in this convincing horror. But be warned that this movie should not be watched by viewers under 18, it's just too damn violent. 8.5/10.
B00003CXCT|1.0|How many changes can you put into a movie before you must declare it a different movie altogether? And if all the changes make the movie worse off than before, and alienate the entire fan-base, why bother? These are not, unfortunately, hypothetical questions, thanks to Mr. Lucas. The original Star Wars movies were cinema history, changing them is like adding lipstick to the Mona Lisa because it's the style nowadays. You'd be changing an integral part of something that people liked very much in its original form...
B00004TJWE|4.0|Sound quality and packaging is first rate.  However, this brilliant LP is a stereo delight....beautifully mixed in stereo by Norman Smith in 1967....why issue it in mono?????  If mono is so bloody important to Snapper, then they should've issued it as a two-CD set...including the mono mix (which they apparently like better) as well as the original stereo mix!<br />By the way, the primary reason why this world's first whole LP rock opera bombed is two primary reasons: 1) EMI wasn't promoting it at all (heck, it wasn't issued in US for a year until Motown got their hands on it and screwed it up...., and 2) the storyline is just an amazing downer that noone would've been able to handle it during the &quot;summer of love&quot; era.  A 100% negative storyline.<br />The reason this is essential is the long-thought-lost full length version of &quot;Defecting Grey&quot;, their first single for UK Columbia.<br />All in all, worth having....I've got mine.
B0001GOH6Q|2.0|Working at blockbuster video, I can tell you that roughly 20% of the DVDs or so are defective.  They don't look like they have any scratches or anything, but they'll just start skipping about an hour into the movie.  I would very very very strongly recommend against buying the DVD, unless you want to deal with returning it until you get a good copy.
B0001Z53CY|4.0|This cd is good not great..  So much talent in this group I would expect more lyrical content!!  But I do think the Album is good.  With songs like 40 oz and Im gonna get my gonna, it keeps me listening!!  I think they should focus more on the group as oppsed to the Eminem is the lead singer joke..Maybe let other people sing the chours.  I Would recmond this Cd to anyone who likes a good rap CD, it could be better but I would by it again!!!!!!!!!!!
0061015725|2.0|I have enjoyed quite a number of Michael Crichton's books (such as Jurassic Park, The Lost World, and Timeline) and I have to say that Prey is one of the worst that he has written.  Jurassic Park/The Lost World is based on the history of dinosaur and in a way, it is a believable science fiction.  Timeline is based on Quantum Machanic and he has done quite a good job in making it as believable as possible.  Being an avid science reader myself, I find that his interpretation of Nanotechnology lacking in many ways.  The story is full of flaws and at times, I really wonder why hasn't the author done more research on the subject matter before taking on the challenge (He has spent many years in preparation of the Timeline story according to him).<br />Nevertheless, if you look not too deep into the details of Nanotechnology, it is quite an engaging storyline.  Hence, the 2 stars.

B0001DI0FI|4.0|This film was really a good effort to compress the contents of several Patrick O'Brian novels into a feature length motion picture. The title is also somewhat misleading , since NONE of the events of \\"Master and Commander\\" are actually portrayed in the film , and the plot heavily relies on \\"Far Side of the World\\" for most of the story line. <br />Russell Crowe really becomes Jack Aubrey , and Paul Bettany portrays a fairly true part of the character Steven Maturin.<BR>Unfortunately for the viewing audience , much of Doctor Maturin's role in the novellae is not revealed , that of the Admiralty intelligence officer.<br />I thought that the portrayal of life aboard a Royal Navy \\"Man O'War\\" was truly outstanding , and the portrayal of the young midshipmen extermely accurate.<br />What I really liked about the film:<BR>(1) Excellent scenes of the ship under full sail.<BR>(2) Russell Crowe's portrayal of \\"Lucky\\" Jack Aubrey.<BR>(3) Realistic battle scenes , not for the faint of heart.<br />What I disliked about the film:<BR>(1) Not enough background on the past history of the major characters.<BR>(2) Story line was abriged too much.<BR>(3) The ending was a little weak , and left LOTS of room for a sequel.<br />Overall , this is a magnificent story of the sea and the iron men who sailed the wooden ships. It could have related to the Napoleonic wars a bit better. Patrick O'Brian has lots of other good action novels that would possibly make a sequel (or sequels) that would be even better than this film. <br />A really strong 4 stars , and I highly recommend it. The \\"bare bones\\" version is a better buy , but the 2 disk set is OK , too.
0345457684|5.0|First, the storytelling is extraordinary. Read the other reviewers for spoilers, descriptions and the assorted lit-crit commentary. In short -- this is phenomenal, and the fact that this is Morgan's first is just shy of unbelievable. I loved it. I bought three copies and gave them to friends and family. This is probably my favorite novel. I can't wait to see it on the big screen.<br />Second, body swapping via a recording device implanted in the brainstem is just bunk. Not just technologically impossible, but widely and routinely dismissed as not even biologically or physically plausible. Personality, memory, perception, thought, analysis, intuition, emotion -- all are functions embedded in structure. That is, physical structure, not transient electrical activity. &quot;Swapping&quot; one &quot;person&quot; for another would require a complete rewiring of the brain of the host, based on a schematic temporal snapshot of the brain of the downloadee. Snapshots (digital encoding) are static -- the human brain is continually evolving and changing, something universally lost in translation. Assuming that its possible to capture the precise physical structure of a system comprised of billions of elements in a continual state of flux, in recreating that system it now becomes subject to initial conditions fully susceptible to the inherent chaotic behavior of molecular biochemistry. Tiny global errors on the quantum level during rearrangement, and bam, you have a whole different person. Worse, with even smaller local errors, and you end up with &quot;transcription errors&quot; that would randomly produce aphasia, impairment, disease, dysfunction, or complete non-function. <br />Complicating this is the fact that the new host body is fundamentally different from the body that gave rise to the mind now inhabiting a foreign vessel. All the sensory data is different -- no two noses, eyes, skins, ears, tongues, &amp;c are the same from one person to the next -- or even between twins or clones. Chaos theory holds that complex systems change, sometime radically, as conditions change. A new mind in an alien body must alter to become something different than what it was, with no clear indication if these changes are benign or catastrophic, and completely begs the question that the brain structures of the traveller are capable of adapting to the new inputs at all. <br />In short, this is ... expensive. Computationally, it looks intractable. As a design, the flaws are probably insoluable. As a business venture, backed by a governmental program and/or funding -- utterly beyond the realm of potential possibility. <br />Okay, with all that said, this is still a fantastic book. Buy it. Buy it now. The story and storytelling alone is more than worth the price (a bit of impossible science) of admission. But isn't that why it's science fiction, after all?
B00018D44U|1.0|I really do not have a great deal to say about this CD. It sounded to me more like a CD of the out takes that were not good enough for the first album. The sound is very similar to her first album, but the tracks here lack any life. This leads to a bland bland noise/sound.<br />So do yourself a favour and save your money to spend on another album you want.
B0001HLVSC|5.0|Missed this at the cinemas, so only caught up with it recently on DVD. I really enjoyed it, even on the small screen. The pacing was good and a lot of emphasis on detail and atmosphere. I have been on many tours of HMS Victory in Portsmouth and a lot of detail is historically correct ( for example removing the partition walls from the captains cabin when going into action). <br />It's not an all action \\"popcorn\\" movie, but one that takes its time, and is more the enjoyable for it. Some reviews commented on difficulty in understanding the dialogue? Might I suggest warm water and cotton wool buds.
B000000OSG|5.0|Guns N Roses started out a career with the crash bam boom bang album &quot;Appetite For Destruction&quot;, one of the greatest Rock Metal albums ever. Coming to the UYI Album, I would have to say that UYI II is the better of the two simply because of the emotions it arouses in listeners. From hatred and anguish to love and heartbreak, it's all there on UYI II. The songs 14 years and So Fine are excellent piano based songs. Breakdown has gotta have one of the greatest beginnings to a song I have ever heard. The song later breaks out into a great solo ending. Civil War is a brilliant song, Axl singing perfectly on this one( He often misses a note or two !!). Cool Hand Luke was a great idea. Locomotive and Shotgun Blues are stupendous angry songs. Coming to the ballads, the Dont Cry on UYI II is much better. Estranged is probably one of the greatest songs Guns n Roses has done. Great solos from Slash to go along with a great video( Please purchase Welcome To The Videos ). November Rain should probably have been on this album to complete the trilogy. But unfortunately the songs were chosen randomly. Knockin on Heavens door could have had a better solo like the one Slash does live but is a great cover in it's own right. Yesterdays and Pretty tied up are sort of fillers on this album compared to the other songs. Where in the world did My World end up on this album. Get in The Ring is a classic rocking song, very angry very raw.<br />All In all one of the greatest albums ever released. You couldn't have really asked for better from one of the greatest rock bands of all time.. <br />PS Why the hell wasnt Slash on the Top 100 Guitarists in Rolling Stone Magazine?
0393312836|4.0|Unless you have fair warning, A Clockwork Orange can be a startling novel.<br />Yes, the slang can be hard to understand at times, yet it does not take away from the story. If anything, it adds to the gang like feel Burgess sought to convey. To tell the truth, I found myself using Burgess' made up words by the end of the book. The scary reality of this futuristic story makes the language even more powerful. <br />The two contrasting ideas of the novel are so well presented that I found myself unable to actually decide which side to agree with. Is it better to choose whether or not to be evil or just to be good? Is free will really what makes us human? What was also a bit disturbing was the fact that I felt sympathy for someone as devilish as Alex. Burgess' incredible storytelling can be thanked for that. From the middle to the end I sympathized then empathized with the little droog. <br />I recommend the novel, especially now in light of recent developments in the world, however I do not recommend the movie. Seeing the movie is not enough, for it does not do the novel justice in the slightest. I do not understand why it received as much acclaim as it had. I find it ironic that the one book Burgess really didn't like, turned out to be his most famous. It was good, not spectacular, but definitely a must read for anyone who likes stories along the lines of Brave New World (I did enjoy Aldous Huxley's masterpiece far more than I enjoyed A Clockwork Orange, though they both have certain un-ignorable similarities). I picked up this novel without having any idea what it was truly about. I did read summaries and things of that nature, but those can only tell you so much. It is the sort of literary work that one needs to read oneself in order to get the full effect.

B00005JMFQ|5.0|I loved this movie when I saw it in the theater and couldn't wait for it to come out on DVD.  Seeing it again, plus all the extras and deleted scenes on the DVD, made it even more of a favorite.  There are so many levels of humor and sadness all throughout the movie, just like real life.  Casting is terrific!  The DVD quality is excellent.
6305603847|4.0|First of all, when I saw it the first time I hated it.  Probably because I hated the trial scene and it is really shocking.  It was far too dark the first time through, and I have gradually grown attached to it.  First though, there are some great scenes, like comfortably numb, hey you, blue skies, the happiest days of our lives and all three bricks.  Those are spectatular.  The flowers fooking though, that is a bit much.<br />I am not really sure wheither the good scenes really redeem the film.
B00005JMSE|5.0|&quot;Hellboy&quot; is the movie adapted from a comic book for people who did not read the comic book, which, in this case, would be me.  That means I was free of any and all preconceptions regarding characters, casting, and plot this time around, unlike previous experiences with Batman, Spider-Man, and the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.  But even from a tabula rassa perspective it is hard to believe that anybody other than Ron Perlman could have played the title role in &quot;Hellboy.&quot;<br />The first key point about this movie is that &quot;Hellboy&quot; works even before Perlman shows up as Big Red and takes over the movie.  We begin in 1944 in Scotland, where a bunch of Nazis have shown up in order to open an inter-dimensional portal to the dark side and summon forth the Seven Gods of Chaos.  True, this is going to end the world, which is probably a bit more than Hitler was bargaining for, but it seems that the original Russian mad monk Grigori Rasputin (Karel Roden), his Aryan bride of death Ilsa (Bridget Hodson), and the blade loving Nazi psycho Kroenen (Ladislav Beran) have a slightly different agenda.  Fortunately, young Professor Trevor Broom (Kevin Trainor), FDR's psychic advisor, and the U.S. Army stop the Nazi plot.  The portal is closed, but not before a little red-skinned horned demon comes through from the other side.<br />We jump ahead to the present, where the rumored sightings of Hellboy are a tabloid staple.  Young clean-cut F.B.I. agent John Myers (Rupert Evans) becomes a part of the agency's Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense where Professor Broom (John Hurt) introduces him to &quot;Abe&quot; Sapien (Doug Jones does the acting but the voice is provided by David Hyde Pierce), a fish like mind-reader/psychic and the adult Hellboy in all of his glory.  Meanwhile, sixty years later Rasputin and his sidekicks are back again and have managed to unleash a monster from inside a statue at the museum.  The fun part about this particular monster is that every time you kill one, two more are born to take its place.  Hellboy has his work cut out for him this time, but Rasputin and Kroenen do something that makes this really personal for our hero.<br />But the ending of the world as we know it is a minor problem compared to Hellboy's love life, which is fixated on the melancholy Liz Sherman (Selma Blair).  She is a pyrokineticist who bursts into flames when she gets excited or angry.  He is a seven-foot red skinned demon from another dimension who is impervious to fire, so it is clearly a perfect match.  But once John convinces Liz to come back to the fold they start spending time together, forcing Hellboy to sneak around on rooftops spying on them.  However, this is all just a prelude to the final showdown with the bad guys and their monsters.  More than any other comic book superhero on the big screen, Hellboy really takes a pounding.  But the big guy keeps coming back for more.<br />Perlman is pitch perfect as Hellboy, his baritone voice providing depth to the character beyond the awesome makeup job.  Working from Mike Mignola's Dark Horse comic books, director Guillermo del Toro (&quot;Blade II&quot;) creates a suitable gothic atmosphere for Hellboy to have his knockdown drag out battles.  But the star here is Perlman's Hellboy.  This is pitch-perfect casting and Perlman is even better here than he was as Vincent on television's &quot;Beauty and the Beast.&quot;  If anything, he is bigger and better than the movie he is in, which is a pretty good accomplishment for a comic book movie.  This guy watches out for kittens during a fight.  What is not to love about Hellboy?r monster is that every time you kill one, two more are born to take its place.  Hellboy has his work cut out for him this time, but Rasputin and Kroenen do something that makes this really personal for our hero.<br />But the ending of the world as we know it is a minor problem compared to Hellboy's love life, which is fixated on the melancholy Liz Sherman (Selma Blair).

But once John convinces Liz to come back to the fold they start spending time together, forcing Hellboy to sneak around on rooftops spying on them.  However, this is all just a prelude to the final showdown with the bad guys and their monsters.  More than any other comic book superhero on the big screen, Hellboy really takes a pounding.  But the big guy keeps coming back for more.<br />Perlman is pitch perfect as Hellboy, his baritone voice providing depth to the character beyond the awesome makeup job.  Working from Mike Mignola's Dark Horse comic books, director Guillermo del Toro (&quot;Blade II&quot;) creates a suitable gothic atmosphere for Hellboy to have his knockdown drag out battles.  But the star here is Perlman's Hellboy.  This is pitch-perfect casting and Perlman is even better here than he was as Vincent on television's &quot;Beauty and the Beast.&quot;  If anything, he is bigger and better than the movie he is in, which is a pretty good accomplishment for a comic book movie.  This guy watches out for kittens during a fight.  What is not to love about Hellboy?
0553212478|4.0|I think that &quot;Frankenstein&quot; is worthy reading material at nearly any level.  Besides a short portion in the middle of the story, this book stays rather interesting throughout.  I especially enjoyed the character Victor.  His emotions, thoughts, and reactions to his creation are convincingly real.  Also, I liked the fact this book did tend to keep the reader a little chilled and anxious.  I feel that this book is appropriate for high school or college courses and is surely a great leisurely read.
0778320448|3.0|Lydia Hoffman wants a fresh start in life, so she opens a knit shop. The shadow of death has loomed over her for too long, even though she is very young. It seems appropriate that the project she advertises as the first for her classes is to knit a baby blanket.<br />Her students are a mixed lot. Jaquie is about to become a reluctant grandmother. Carol desperately hopes for a baby, though the odds are against it. Alix is there to perform community service, knitting for the Linus project. Despite their glaring differences, the four women not only knit blankets but friendships and knit the bridges in their other relationships.<br />*** Debbie Macomber, whether her heroines are spirit beings or ordinary women, always writes about angels, messengers of God. Her stories are full of hope, and though not billed as inspirational, per se, they never fail to inspire. This is a sterling example of that rule. ***<BR>Amanda Killgore
B0001BKAEY|3.0|Critics, in general, maligned this movie - perhaps unfairly.  The trouble is, it had SO MUCH to live up to.  How could it fail to disappoint?  <br />It's true that this is my least favorite of the Matrix movies.  When I re-watched the film, I tried to ascertain the meaning of this.  I think it is because it gives us the least of what we enjoyed about The Matrix in the first place.  The Matrix succeeds in the unlikely task of making a sci-fi, kung fu action flick out of Cartesian philosophy.  The first movie was about ideas and it also had a completely unique look to it.  The second movie got bogged down a bit with its ideas and made them seem a bit like mumbo-jumbo.  However, the second film had terrific fight scenes and a great highway chase.<br />The problem about The Matrix: Revolutions is that, not only is it not about ideas - we hardly spend any time in The Matrix.  The big set-piece in this movie is the fight between the Squids and the defenders of Zion.  I wasn't too interested in that.  For one thing, there were so many Squids, I couldn't believe that the humans wouldn't be overwhelmed or retreat immediately.<br />After Trinity rescues Neo at the beginning, we don't go back to The Matrix until the end.  That means no kung fu fighting and - even worse - no Agent Smith!  Agent Smith is the most fun character in these movies and under using him here is a critical flaw.  The best part of the film is the final confrontation between Smith and Neo.<br />The Matrix Revolutions is still a good movie and worth owning.  The Matrix phenomenon has taken on a life of its own and the three movies fit well together as a set.  However, unlike Star Wars, The Matrix starts out strong but progressively declines.
B00005LOUP|4.0|I can't believe I liked this movie. I hate Jim Carrey. He was nothing like he is in his other movies. This movie is great. I love how they added more to the story than the original cartoon version. A must own.
0060392886|5.0|I bought this book in 2001 at an airport when I was going off on holiday. Although I had heard of Motley Crue I had never heard any of their music, but reading positive reviews of the book convinced me to buy it.<BR>Whilst on holiday I was so engrossed by this book I would try to find any excuse to go back to my hotel to read it. My friends would take the mickey out of me, 'there he is with his nose in that book again' and they would ask me if I was a fan of the band as it wasn't the sort of music my group of friends would usually listen to. But by the end I was so passionate about the book that I convinced another friend to read it, and he spent the second week of the holiday doing exactly what I had done in the first week. At the end of the holiday my other friend was intrigued to find out what was so good about this book. She read it non-stop for the last day and the flight back home. Since then it has been passed around many of my friends who after some convincing that they should read a book about a band who they have either never heard of or not given a care about, and they have loved the book. Today, nearly 3 years since that holiday I finally got my copy of the book back and I can't wait to read it again. And maybe pass it onto my friend who I first lent it to who wants to read it again and keep the cycle going again.<BR>By the way, I bought a Motley Crue CD and thought it was rubbish.
B0001AP12G|5.0|I love Kanye West's music. I really like &quot;All Falls Down&quot; with Syleena Johnson. I love her music. I have never heard her music get musch radio play or her videos get played so much on music video channels such as MTV, BET, and VH1. She is very underrated. Buy this.
0684823454|5.0|Anyone who hated school may like this book very much.  Churchill was a privileged aristocrat who viewed 'science' and 'democracy' as retrograde developments.  And yet, any reader today would be naturally drawn towards the romantic, exciting, exotic picture of an empire that the young winston paints from someone born with common sense, good nature, pride and a hunger to play his part in glorious events.<br />This book was written by Churchill when he was short of cash - it had to be successful.  Also it was written well before he became a world-weary statesman.  By so royaly entertaining his readers he betrays himself to us as a pretty down to earth and likeable character  - perhaps very different to the complex man he really was, or the very great man he was eventually to become.<br />One thing strikes me from the book is that Churchill was probably as unforgiving with himself as he was with other people - he comes across as someone with tremendous moral integrity and character.  Yet, by the standards of many others he was seen as outspoken, bumptious, obdurate and opinionated, a war monger etc etc.  <br />Progress was never made by reasonable people and this book is a superb way to get to know this mercurial, unorthodox, unlikely hero.  It is a story of his coming of age at the turn of the 18th century and is one of those books that all bold adventurous men should perhaps read at some time during their lives. <br />A fantastic eye witness account of the British empire and the 'larger than life' people behind it.
B00005JMFQ|2.0|&quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; is great.  &quot;Notting Hill&quot; is basically enjoyable.  But this movie is basically terrible, though a few great performances and funny moments enliven it.  It follows the format of some of the cheesiest romantic anthology shows of the 1970s like &quot;Love American Style&quot; and &quot;The Love Boat,&quot; interweaving improbable, and therefore quite sappy, love stories together, in which the characters generally have only incidental or coincidental relationships with one another -- i.e. the final group of scenes at a children's Christmas pageant and at an airport gate, where all the characters happen to be together.  The outcome of each little story is almost entirely predictable from the first scene or two in which the characters and situations are introduced.  Probably this is true because they give each tale so little time, any detours into surprise would cause this bland souffle to collapse.<br />The two stars are for the one truly excellent performance here, Emma Thompson's.  She was ubiquitous for a few years, but she's pulled back, so it now feels like a rare pleasure to see her work in a domestic story like this.  I also enjoyed the burned out rock star's story.  If you happen to catch this on cable, those two pieces will give you pleasure.  The rest will make you feel like you ate too much cotton candy.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Knowing Kanye West only for his productions,you may at first think that this album is all good beats but garbage lyrics. If you think that, then you like myself and so many others could not have been more wrong. This album is an example of what many people consider \\"real hip-hop\\". Kanye West might even be one of the most lyrical rap artist in the game right now. Over statement? Then listen closely to songs like; \\"Get'Em High\\", \\"Never Let Me Down\\", \\"New Workout Plan\\" and the list goes on. Matter of fact listen to the whole album. My personal favorite is \\"Jesus Walks\\". Another song that shows not only Kanye West's lyrical skills but how deep the man is. Not many rappers talk about Jesus, but more about guns. Plus the guest appearances are not bad (although Kanye has the best verse in all the songs). Common and Talib Kwali rip the song \\"Get'Em High\\" and Mos Def and Freeway are a good addition to the song \\"Two Words\\". The album is very diverse, but mostly filled with deep songs, such as \\"Through the Wire\\", \\"All Falls Down\\", \\"Family Business\\" and so on (which is good because it gives you something different to listen to other than what you always hear on radio). My only problem is that this album has too many skits, but it can still be considered a classic. One time for Kanye!
B00005JMEW|4.0|Watching this movie is such a joy; especially for those of us who are movie buffs and have had watched martial arts and samurai movies.  With the advent of digital technology, computer has taken over the art of making movie: Matrix trilogy, Jurrasic Park franchise, Terminator trilogy being some examples.  It doesn't mean that lesser technology movies are faring worse than those examples illustrated.  With a good script, good direction, good idea, good team behind you, a movie can also kick arse without blowing the budget.  This movie is obviously a labour of love for Quentin.  It's really wonderful sitting through the bonus material regarding the making of this movie.  I strongly recommend viewers to watch them so that you have an in-depth understanding of where Quentin gets his inspiration from.  In this movie, Quentin pays respect to those stars of yesteryears such as Sonny Chiba (famous for his black &amp; white samurai films), Gordon Liu (famous for his Shaw Brothers' martial arts movies) by having them in this movie.  Nowadays, it's not common for movies to change the way movies are shown.  However, this movie has everything: from black &amp; white samurai style to Japanese manga style(!!!) to spagetti western style to all-out martial arts style to Brian de Palma's split screen style (just for a bit of fun, in Quentin's own word) to 70's Shaft style to Quentin's unique colourful dialogue style.  And it's amazing how seamless the transition is from one another.  Quentin commented that he felt home when he made this movie in Japan and China but felt like he was on location when he gotten back to the States, a display of how much he adores the cultures that shapes him into the Director that he is today.  Never a moment I feel that Quentin is making a violent movie for the sake of it but for the FUN of it.  He's a different cattle of fish compared with Oliver Stone.  I can't wait for the second offering, that's for sure.  Highly recommended.  By the way, the soundtrack provided by Wu-Tang Clan's producer, RZA (I think) is pertinent and effective here.  Again, a labour of love for him too.

B0000C1733|1.0|What a waste! I remember when \\"Californication\\" came out and I thought these guys have it made. They have created a music style that everybody loves and they have figured out how to go platinum with every album (every album since \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magik\\"). When I heard that the Red Hot Chili Peppers were coming out with their third greatest hits album, I was pretty excited, until I saw the track listing. Starting off with \\"Give It Away\\"? That's a bad start right there. First, you can't start an album with \\"Give It Away\\". Second, put on the '80s hits, but if you want it to fit it on one disc and exclude the '80s hits, then don't put on \\"Higher Ground\\". If your going to put on \\"Higher Ground\\" then put on the other songs from<BR>\\"Mother's Milk\\" that were hits- Taste The Pain, Johnny, Kick A Hole In The Sky and Knock Me Down. If you're going to put the '90s hits on, then put them on. They forgot \\"Warped\\",<BR>\\"Shallow Be Thy Game\\", \\"Aeroplane\\", \\"Coffee Shop\\", \\"If You Had To Ask\\", \\"Around The World\\", \\"Search And Destroy\\", and \\"Love Rollercoaster\\". Here is a compilation of all of their hits excluding the stuff on \\"By The Way\\" because that album is definately their worst album and there is nothing outstanding on that album at all.

B0000C9JFO|4.0|This movie is a refreshing blend of the serious and not-so serious - which some previous reviewers seem to miss (they are alternately taking the not-so-serious too seriously and vice versa). The previous reviewer &quot;monsieurms&quot; has made the assertion that the &quot;hero, at the end, for some reason abandons his life's dreams.&quot; That is ridiculous - for that is exactly the opposite of the truth. His life dream was to be a writer - but as he grew older he fell into the trap of doing what is &quot;realistic&quot; (in his case - a &quot;real&quot; job in economics). After the character experienced a year in Barcelona, learning many lessons along the way, he RETURNED to his life dream of wanting to be a writer. He didn't abandon it! I'm not sure how anyone could watch the film and miss that point...<br />The reviewer goes on to question the lead character's morals. But the point is, he was young - he made mistakes and learned. Just because the filmmaker didn't beat us over the head with moralisms does not mean the character's &quot;despicable&quot; behavior was considered acceptable. My advice to &quot;monsieurms&quot; is to try to think from the CHARACTER'S perspective - not your own. And learn to see the more subtle elements in a film. Otherwise, you might as well stick to action/adventure films like &quot;Raiders of the the Lost Ark&quot; or &quot;Star Wars.&quot;
B0001Z53CY|5.0|The Album is decent....the first 2 songs r hardcore...so they r awesome...and of course theres 40 oz and My Band ....but other than that....the other songs r just good songs....not the regular-exceptional-D12-like songs........but i bought it....cuz i thought it wud b good...and as far as i kno......it is worth it
B0001HAHXW|2.0|I like the blues. I like Robert Johnson. I like Eric Clapton. If you share these likes, don't buy this CD. It is spiritless.

0393312836|2.0|I did not enjoy reading Clockwork Orange, although understand the book became easier through the chapters.  The main character, Alex, is a naive and immature boy who experiences harsh consequences to his actions, but they are well deserved.  Even though his crimes were out of fun, not meaning to kill anyone, they did, and he showed no sign of remorse.  He doesn't learn from his mistakes and his true feelings are masked by his inability to perform violent acts.<br />The language used in the book is difficult at first to understand, but with repitition, I got used to it and could understand the plot.  I like the fact that the language is unique, but I don't think the book has any other great values.  There is no significant difference between Alex at the beginning of the book and at the end.  Like all his actions, he has no real reason to start a family.  He acts on sporadic instincts and doesn't think about the things that he does.  Weeks of physical torture could not keep him from his violent thoughts, and the idea of growing up most likely won't either.<br />I found this book tiring because it was so wordy and I found no real attachment to any of the characters because the only ones described in depth were cold and violent.
B0001932ZA|2.0|What do you get when you combine interviews with people from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the American Civil Liberties Union, and other random idiots?  Think it's a protest taking place in Washington, or a news story on slashdot.org or your favorite left-wing website?  Nope, it's a &quot;special feature&quot; on the Running Man special edition DVD.  Apparently the studio responsible for this release decided tinfoil hat politics would help sell the movie.  Yep, nothing like 30 minutes of &quot;THE GUVMINT'S SPYING ON US!!!111&quot;  And I sincerely hope this mistake is not repeated.  I'm an avid movie watcher but if heavily-biased political commentary like this starts showing up in DVDs on a regular basis I'll just find something else to do with my 15-20 bucks per movie.  I've got better things to do with my time and money than support wackos like this.<br />Oh, and the movie itself was pretty decent.
B0001Z53AQ|5.0|I love this cd, and Em does a great job.  The rap artists on this album are phenomenal just as they were on &quot;Devil's Night.&quot;  If you like Eminem, 50, or any other great rap artist, you'll love this album!
068484267X|5.0|Angela's Ashes was a real exciting read for me.  Going through the growing process of Frankie McCourt proved to be more captivating than i had expected.  He revealed personal details about himself that you would not expect and overcame great poverty, getting virtually no help from his drunken father.  It's a great read and i recommend it to everyone.
B000066JES|5.0|I have trouble deciding between this or Kings of Metal as my favorite of the second era of Manowar. I seperate the eras using their worst album, Fighting the World, as the middle album. This is their most diverse release yet, which was a title once held by Kings of Metal. Some tracks may offset metal purists but if you can have an open mind you may believe as I do that it's all just as perfect because it would almost seem Manowar can do no wrong(besides the song Blow Your Speakers). <br />The production on this is a bit better than most Manowar outings though not quite so bombastic as Triumph of Steel's. There are a few metal anthems, a few very heavy songs(in fact rivaling a good amount of their previous material) and a few &quot;ballads&quot; as some would call them. All in all it makes for a much more complete listening experience, like a story is being told to you using music instead of words and it truly is beautiful to hear. Now let's crack this down...<br />1. Call to Arms - What an excellent beginning, a song that is halfway in between being one of their heavier songs and one of their metal anthems. <br />2. The Fight for Freedom - This is great patriotic stuff, very uplifting and moving.<br />3. Nessun Dorma - One of my favorites off of this, a cover of an old famous opera, this is just absolutely beautiful in every way and proves once again that Eric Adams is the absolute greatest vocalist in all of heavy metal.<br />4. Valhalla - Not much to say about this, just a little 40 second interlude, interesting though. <br />5. Swords in the Wind - Definitly something you can sing along to, great song. <br />6. An American Trilogy - This is another one many people complain about but I personally think is a wonderful song embodying the patriotism of other tracks with the excellent dramatic music of Nessun Dorma.<br />7. The March - An orchestral instrumental, it certainly isn't Beethoven but this is beyond what I could expect from any metal band. This is great tolisten to, emotional and sweeping. <br />8. Warriors of the World United - The best anthem on the album, I can't wait to be singing along to this when I see them live. <br />9. Hand of Doom - Well here we go Manowar die-hards, this is one of their heaviest tracks to date, this should totally satisfy your hunger for Manowar music more true to the old days, just an excellent song in general as well.<br />10. House of Death - Sort of like part 2 of the last song, more formulaic but also more rockin', this is another hall of fame hit for Manowar.<br />11. Fight Until We Die - Good song but is this really the best way to finish this? Makes you ache for the days of Blood of the Kings, Bridge of Death,and March for Revenge (by the soldier's of death) but oh well. <br />All in all this album is simply put,amazing, pick it up!
B000001GBJ|3.0|Overall I could have made a less desirable purchase I guess, but the CD was less than what I expected.  After hearing two tracks from the CD on the radio, I expected the entire CD to be similar.....it wasn't.  If waffling between this CD and another choice, I'd recommend the other choice.
B0000033OZ|5.0|In 1971, keyboard wiz Keith Emerson, fresh off his stint with the Nice, formed a progressive rock power trio with singer/guitarist Greg Lake of King Crimson, and drummer Carl Palmer of Atomic Rooster. Their self-titled debut album from '71 still stands as one of the group's very best releases. Emerson brilliantly plays a wide variety of keyboards (including the Royal Festival Hall organ for one track), Lake's powerful vocals, booming bass &amp; expert guitar lines simply amaze, and Palmer is a mighty stickman, trouncing his huge drumkit into submission with the greatest of ease. &quot;The Barbarian&quot; &amp; &quot;Tank&quot; are both thunderous instrumental tracks, allowing the trio to really stretch out. Lake's 12 1/2 minute epic, &quot;Take A Pebble,&quot; is a truly beautiful piece. &quot;Knife-Edge&quot; is a classic ELP rocker. Emerson's three-part keyboard suite, &quot;The Three Fates,&quot; remains one of his greatest contributions to the band, and, of course, there's Lake's timeless, FM radio sing-along classic, &quot;Lucky Man,&quot; complimented by Emerson's avant-garde synthesiser flourishes and Palmer's thumping drumwork. Great music and performances from end to end, and brilliantly engineered by Eddie Offord (who also worked with Yes around the same time), Emerson Lake &amp; Palmer's debut disc is a magnificent album, and one of the great jewels in the progessive rock crown.
B000148KK2|3.0|I was very worried when I heard that Diana married Elvis Costello, and I was afraid that what is happening to her, would happen. Diana is a Jazz musician, coming from what Jazz is about, musicianship, solos, and showing why you practice 8 hours a day. Elvis Costello is the exact opposite, very little talent, no practice needed. I notice that other reviews are bothered by the lack of solos. Wait unitl he has a little more time to corrupt her, and turn her into a pop star. Well at least it will leave room for a new Diana Krall that hopefully won't be corrupted. Maybe on her next album she will have Costello, and Kenny G so she can put the final stake in the heart of her music.
B000002MY3|5.0|Alanis Morissette is a brilliant songwriter.  Alanis seems to write in such a quirky way that it is almost like reading a Virginia Woolf book.  I love the manner in which she takes her album titles from one of the verses in her songs.  The title and verse 'Jagged Little Pill' seems almost like an afterthought in the song &quot;You Learn&quot;.  The CD is rated five stars because you can listen to the entire CD without skipping any of the tracks.  Of course, there are standout tracks, which include &quot;You Oughta Know&quot;, &quot;Right Through You&quot; and &quot;You Learn&quot;.  The track &quot;Perfect&quot; really resonated with me because I can really relate to the situation that the song describes.  There is also a hidden track that is outstanding.  It is a capella and lets you know that in addition to being a gifted songwriter, Alanis also has the vocal talent to warrant her success.
B000002J09|5.0|Within eighteen months three members of this band had gone from total obscurity to part of the best known rock band in the world. By the end of 1971 world domination was such that they could release their fourth album without any sleeve notes, no band image or song titles on the sleeve either. Therefore it has since been called by fans a variety of names from the obvious 'Led Zeppelin IV' to the less obvious 'Runes' after its many Lord of the Rings references to 'Four Symbols'. Or 'Zosa' after its inside cover motif, or plain old 'No Title'. Still, on pre-sales it went to #1 all over the world, being released on November 8th and staying at #1 into the New Year. Over the years it has probably generated enough sales to run a fairly large country. In the last thirty-two years it has won just about every accolade there is to get. Voted the best rock record ever in such illustrious magazines as 'Classic Rock Revisited', `Rolling Stone', 'Q', 'Mojo', and even the Pattaya Mail. (We just had a vote Toto, Ella Crew, Andy, and Led Zeppelin experts Lars Fieste, John Osborne, Graham Rudd, Dai Coe, and the Dog - it was unanimous.)<br />If you had wanted to put together a super group in 1971 all you would of had to do was put together Led Zeppelin, and there you are you had it. Out of the ashes of the `Yardbirds' founding member Jimmy Page created Led Zeppelin (well, he had to, all the others had left). The new band did one tour of Scandinavia as 'The New Yardbirds'.<br />Jimmy Page originally joined the `Yardbirds' as bassist, but switched to lead guitar to give the band a duel pronged guitar attack with a certain Jeff Beck on the other axe. Jimmy Page had long been a top session player, playing most famously on the Kinks' `You Really Got Me' famous guitar riff that almost invented heavy metal music. In Jimmy Page Led Zeppelin had a man with a vision as well as a guitarist that could shred the wallpaper off your walls one second and be as gentle as a snowflake the next.<br />Robert Plant had quickly become the template of what a singer in a rock band looked and sounded like. His unique style of whoops, whines, and yells became his trademark. With his clear vocals he could always put across the stories he wanted to tell in his song writing partnership with Jimmy Page.<br />Bass player John Paul Jones also had a previous successful career as a session player, but was completely unknown outside the inner music circles. His quiet nature, his bass playing skills, keyboard work, and help with the song writing were integral parts in the band and essential to its well being.<br />Then behind the drums was the man to set standards of rock 'n' roll to the present day, even after his tragic death more than twenty years ago, Mr. John Bonham. (I mean even his name sounds like a drummer.) This God of Thunder only got the job because he went down with Robert Plant to keep him company on his journey from Birmingham, England, to audition for the band. The rest - as they say - is history.<br />Is Led Zeppelin's fourth album as good as its reputation? Has it stood the test of time?<br />Stupid questions, of course it does. You get eight tracks all of which are classic. The opening one-two of the first couple of tracks allay any fears of fans that thought they might delve back further into their folksy roots after the rather laid back 'Led Zeppelin III' of the previous year. But the year of constant touring had honed their natural rocking instincts.<br />As soon as Robert Plant leads the band off with those immortal lines,<br />  `Hey, Hey Mama, said the way you move,<br />  Gonna make You sweat Gonna make You groove,<br />  My, My Child when You shake that thing,<br />  Gonna make you burn, Gonna make You sting.`...<br />...you know you are off into totally politically incorrect rock 'n' roll heaven. The band then comes in with `Black Dog's thunderous riff and off they all fly roaring straight the way through until you go without a second to catch your breath into the 'Rock and Roll' opening drum intro. What do you expect to get with a title like this? Page just peels off one riff after another, building them up to a shattering crescendo. John Paul Jones backs this up with some of the busiest fret work ever laid down in a studio by a mere mortal of his chosen profession. As for John (Bonzo) Bonham, he is a man at the height of his powers having the time of his life.<br />Other tracks include the wonderful 'Four Sticks', so called because John Bonham gets the sound he wanted for the song drummed with four sticks simultaneously. (Obvious, isn't it, when you think about it.) An acoustic ballad in 'Going to California'. A keyboard orientated rocker in 'Misty Mountain Top', which on any other album, by any other band, would be the center piece of any collection. However, on this album it sometimes gets overlooked by its surroundings, but comes across as a real delight in the context of the album. There is also a raging folksy tale told with Robert Plant giving full reign to his Tolkien whims in the wonderful 'The Battle of Evermore', with some dexterous mandolin played by Jimmy Page. Robert Plant is able to display his vocal chops in his duet with Sandy Denny (ex-Fairport Convention), who in her illustrious but tragic career had probably never sung so sweet.<br />The album closes with one of the darkest songs Led zeppelin ever recorded 'When the Levee Breaks', a blues as only Led Zeppelin can play, with Robert Plant's vocals and harmonica play and Jimmy Page's guitar to the fore as the others lay down a rock solid spine to the song.<br />This was Led Zeppelin's finest hour, and therefore rightly holds the claim to #1 album of all time.<br />Oh by the way it also includes 'Stairway to Heaven'. Does any body remember laughter?<br />Mott the Dog<br />Re-mastered by Ella Crewrous riff and off they all fly roaring straight the way through until you go without a second to catch your breath into the 'Rock and Roll' opening drum intro.

0140131558|3.0|We were suposed to read &quot;City of Glass&quot; out of Auster's NEW YORK TRILOGY in our English advanced class. I believe the mystery of chance and the multiple personalities of the protagonist are crucial for Austers first detective story. The well chosen setting fits perfectly into the plot. Auster writes about an isolated , lonely writer  at the mid-thirty, who has pleasant success in writing detective stories. Just by accident the protagonist gets the opportunity to solve an obscure case as an pseudo-detetective. It is easy to follow the plot, but somehow the reader happens to mix up the charachters. But you will never be bored while reading it, even though there are parts of the story wiht not much suspense.
B0001AP12G|4.0|Kanye West's first CD seems fueled by the struggle to get it released. The last track is a 9+ minute praise to Rocafella for offering him the deal after prior rejection, and &quot;Through The Wire&quot; is redemption through the pain of an auto accident. I appreciate Kanye for having a concept, a sense of humor, and a connection to folks like Common and Taleb Kweli. I could do without Jay Z's contributions. He seems to be overrelying on his &quot;let me speed up that sample&quot; technique as well. I do dig &quot;Jesus Walks&quot;, and I think this is a track that Christians need to hear, not because it is necessarily religious, but because it is a good litmus test on your particular brand of faith.<br />The opening track is really funny with it's &quot;jokes on you, we're still alive&quot; hook and &quot;I just wanna stop for your love&quot; sped up sample. I like &quot;All Fall's Down&quot; too.<br />It will be real intersting to see how Kanye follows all of this praise and adulation on future work. As a rapper, his flow is secondary to his cleverness of composition, and he may have used up many of his riffs on this first CD.<br />I dig Kanye West, and this pretty much lives up to the hype. It's not going to push my Tribe or Mos Def out of my CD long term, but it is a rare mainstream rap album with heart and humor worthy of purchase.<br />--4 stars.
0140131558|4.0|In my advanced english course at school we were supposed to read Paul Auster's \\"City of Glass\\" the first of Paul Auster's detective stories from his book \\"The New York Triology\\". With no expectations i began to read the story about Daniel Quinn while thinking that it certainly would be one of those boring books we are often to read in school. But my first impression was wrong. With every line i read the story got more and more interesting. Paul Auster achieves it to build up an exciting story in which Daniel Quinn, a detective story writer, recieves a phone call with whom the story turns into a curios way. The main protagonist has to protect a man whose psychotic father wants to kill him. Quinn loses track of the mystery so that he loses everything he has. Almost the whole story is based on chance and gets interesting by curving the story of Don Quiote or the history of the Paradies. Paul Auster also succeeds in connecting themes like \\"identities\\",\\"isolaton\\",\\"hunger\\" and \\"poverty\\".
B000002KLP|5.0|I've been revisiting a lot of Prince's stuff in the wake of his new album and recent acquisition of his HITS/B Side 3 disc set. \\"Dirty Mind\\" is the type of album that I was unable to fully appreciate when it came out.(...) Listening to it again, this album is a rocking electrofunk that pushes the envelope lyrically. \\"Head\\", \\"Uptown\\", and \\"Partyup\\" are all out funk jams. Clean guitars trade jabs with popping slap bass on these tracks. And the man just lays down on the one. Prince would have better selling albums and later stuff vaulted him into superstar status and pop trailblazer. But if you want to see the best of pre-\\"Purple Rain\\" Prince at his funkiest with tight songs, this is the album to go with.<br />-5 stars
0140131558|4.0|I like to give you a little impression of my opinion about Paul Auster's book &quot;City of Glass&quot;. We were supposed to read it in the 13.form as a part of our main topic &quot;detective stories&quot;.<BR>It took us some time but it was more interesting than the other books we read in this year(Macbeth, Of Mice and Men). When you have read this book you get a closer look into the world's different identities and those of its citizen. <BR>In Paul Auster's clever piece of work &quot;City of Glass&quot; fiction and reality is mixed up. The theme of chance is like in other works of Auster seen as the main topic of the story. Daniel Quinn, normally an author, who lost his family, is mixed up with Paul Auster and so starts to become a detective. During the story it is not obvious which identity the protagonist uses and who he will be next. The order of actions is unpredictable.<BR>Paul Auster created a novel which is extraordinary and which will  be kept in mind by every one who read it.<BR>I would everybody give the advice to read this book because of its postmodernist style which suits very well to our time.

0140131558|3.0|Hi I'm a german highschool studend. In class we were supposed to read &quot;the city of glass&quot;. Today we all write a review on it. <BR>Honestly it is not to much of a story for me. The fact I liked, was the fall of the protagonist. After all it is just an everyday story about the facts of life. I feel people deerve to be what they are, not more not less. And that's what happens. After getting a job the detectiv gets lost in his task. Eventually he loses almost evrything he ownes but what he always thought he would be. Altough one could be of the opinion that everything in our lifes is pales and therefor chance does not exist the reader is only confronted with chance. In the end you feel that you really should not do anyhing, just because chance can probably do better than you.
0618526412|2.0|A truly overrated and awful book. Full of over-the-top imagery, cartoon characters, hoary motivations, semi-socialist polemics (truthfully it is so muddled it is difficult to find the point) and adolescent heavy breathing on the subjects of sex and fidelity and loyalty. It would be funny if it wasn't so earnest. <br />Hemingway summed it up best by calling the book, \\"phony.\\"

B00005JMFQ|5.0|The premise of this movie is that despite all the violence and hate in the world, LOVE actually is everywhere you look. The movie proves this point with the telling of eight interconnected stories and an amazing cast that includes Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Colin Firth, Laura Linney, Hugh Grant, Billy Bob Thorton, and an incredible child actor, Thomas Sangster. The setting is London in the weeks leading up to Christmas, and the various tales are a skillful combination of sweetly uplifting and poignantly sad. It is a rare movie which succeeds in being heartwarming without being sappy, and in that respect, Love Actually thrives.<br /><br />The movie, though long, has so much going on that it is easy for the viewer to sustain attention.  However, the DVD release includes three deleted scenes.  While I do believe that these provided some additional insight into the characters (I especially enjoyed the extra interplay between grieving husband Daniel and his stepson, Sam), given the length of the movie, it is understandable why the scenes were left out.  Regardless, director Richard Curtis does an excellent job bringing the movie to a stunning, uplifting, and emotionally gratifying conclusion.  This is a modern-day romantic comment perfect for mature audiences looking for something a bit beyond the traditional boy-meets-girl, and I highly recommend it.
0060512806|4.0|This is a very &quot;manly&quot; book, and I'm sure I wouldn't be drawn to it upon hearing only a bald plot outline (WWII battles, ugh, data transfer protocols, boring!) but Neal Stephenson managed to not only draw me in but fascinate me for 900+ pages.<br />This is a sprawling historical saga, rich in detail and invention, not-so-concerned with characters' emotional states but rather just what *are* they going to do next--which certainly helps propel the book forward.  <br />The story unfolds across two timelines, and the characters of the contemporary plot are the descendents of the earlier.  Since no one has any children yet at the earlier timeline, you're guaranteed a certain amount of survival from your protagonists (I always appreciate being able to relax at least a little!).<br />I had one false start with the book, reading about a quarter into it, then setting it aside when easier, blither books came my way.  I'm delighted I picked it up again (I re-read from the beginning) and have moved on to his most recent, which details the lives of the characters' great-great-great-great-great-great-grandparents (so if you like Cryptonomicon, do pick up the Quicksilver, it's exactly the same idiom).<br />Cryptonomicon's style is comparable to that of Dickens, in its skillful handling of numerous characters and subplots, to Tom Wolfe, in its exhaustive look at a particular subset of people at a particular time, to Victoria Holt (honestly) in its somewhat Gothic atmosphere and its sense that characters' acitivities can have implications down through generations, and to Eugene Sue, both for the well-handled theatrical sprawl and the intangible sense of purpose the characters convey.  A nifty book!<br />Note: a 3 star ranking from me means a pleasant enough read; 4 stars indicate a very enjoyable work; but I'll only give 5 stars to books that are or ought to be classic; sadly, most books published seem to warrant 2 or less ... I try not to read those.
6302759110|3.0|Yeah, I was excited about this movie, because I love the book.  I can't believe that they actually called this Bram Stoker's Dracula, because this is nothing like the book.  Of course the settings are basically the same and they throw in some quotes from the book (half the time they are used in a completely different context though), but this business about Dracula and Mina being in love is complete crap (nothing even close to this happens in the book).  It wouldn't be so bad if somehow this enhanced the story.  It doesn't, it completely destroys it; and if that wasn't bad enough, this added aspect of the movie really becomes the entire point of the movie.<br />Yeah, I'm not a complete purist either; if the love thing even made it remotely entertaining, I think it would be forgiveable; but it doesn't.  Also, the acting really is pretty terrible on all acounts.<br />It still get's three stars only because there are several scenes that are pretty cool to look at, but that's about it.  If you really want Dracula, read the book.
B0001906O0|5.0|Before anyone else complains about the so-called missing tracks from this release, you need to understand a few things...<br />Firstly it would be impossible to include everything from the past 26 years on 4 discs.  Secondly, all the remastered albums will released in 2004, and will likely include a bonus disc of out-takes and other tracks that did not make the original album release.<br />This release is truly excellent and will be appreciated by those of you who purchased the double-length cassette &quot;Standing on a Beach&quot; and have had enough of replacing it.
B000002UUX|5.0|Even though Megadeth and Metallica were practically competitors of the metal genre and constantly trying to outdo each other, this album changed metal for the fact that it was so brutal that it influenced Metallica to create a softer approach to metal music (result:'The Black Album'). Although it practically predicted the downfall the genre, 'Rust In Peace' remains the last great metal album. Thanks to the guitar virtuoso talent of both Dave Mustaine and ex-Cacophony guitarist Marty Friedman, the album not only rocks hard as hell, the guitar solos are rapid fire speed and tend to only get faster as the disc proceeds. David Ellefson's bass lines are catchy, but often repetetive. Nick Menza's thrashing and lightning-fast drumming sure beats the hell out of Megadeth's previous drum-machine-sounding skin-pounder, Gar Samuelson. The one thing you have to get used to is Dave Mustaine's squeaky voice that sounds like he just got neutered. I must admit that I often wonder if I bump their music full blast in my car, would it be Megadeth's  raw power that breaks my windshield...or Dave Mustaine's shrill vocals? All the tracks are great, but the highlights are: &quot;Holy Wars...The Punishment Due&quot;, &quot;Hangar 18&quot;, &quot;Take No Prisoners&quot;, &quot;Lucretia&quot;, and &quot;Rust In Peace...Polaris&quot;. If I could change one thing about this album, I would put a blues cover on it like they did for 'Peace Sells...But Who's Buying?' (Willie Dixon's &quot;I Ain't Superstitious&quot;). Why not cover, saaaaaaay.......Muddy Water's &quot;Mannish Boy&quot;?

0316776963|2.0|This is a person who grew up in a middle class family, has a pushy, over-supportive Dad, experiments with drugs, and ends up hooking up with a Sugar Daddy.  This book was like sitting through an extemely bad After School Special.  I have to admit his simplistic-sarcastic writing style did hold my attention but it would be great if he had something interesting to write about... like someone else's life -- someone who has got past thinking their story of growing up in middle America is an incredible epic. <BR>Get over yourself!
0688156819|5.0|This book has to be one of THE BEST books I have ever read.  Five stars is not good enough to descripe this, it should have more like 58 stars!  It was written by Tim Burton so only the best is expected, seeing how he is one of the best directors in the history of forever.  I've spent many hours reading this book, and have done more than 18 schools projects about it.  It's that good!!!
0393312836|5.0|This is one of the most interesting books I have ever read.  It was a little awkward that I found myself really enjoying this book.  The content is very disturbing, but the way Burgess writes, makes it absolutely fascinating.  Burgess uses a type of Russified slang that takes a little bit of reading to get used to, but don't let that stop you.  Some of the books have dictionaries of the slang words, but I'd recommend not using it.  One of the best parts of this book is that you find yourself able to understand what he is saying even though you don't quite understand the language.  It is also interesting how the sections of the book mirror each other.  There are a lot of recurring events that happen over the course of the book to look for, while reading it.  And if you have read the earlier American version of the book, that only has 20 chapters, be sure to pick up the newer version with the complete 21 chapters.  That goes for the movie as well, it was made based on the 20 chapter version of the book, so it's a good idea to read the book with all 21 chapters, if you have already scene the movie.  That last chapter adds a whole new spin on the book.<br />Burgess also explores some very deep political themes.  The idea of Ludovico's technique, which is mentioned in the book, shows Burgess's views on Skinner's behaviorist theory, which can also be applied to Communism.  This book is very thought provoking and brings up a lot of controversial issues that can be great class discussion topics.
0385333846|3.0|This was an interesting book that I would not have choosen if it had not been for a recommendation from my english teacher.

Unless you are an extreamly analitical person I would recommend reading this book with an english teacher or somebody would could help you to understand the &quot;deeper meanings&quot;.
B0000C7PQK|5.0|I fell in love with Enigma in the 90's with MCMXC A.D.  Later I got The Screen Behind the Mirror, which was OK, but not as good as the first one.  Then I got Voyageur, and rather than give a technical review, I'll tell you my reaction to this CD.  When I got it, I put it in my car CD player and didn't take it out for over a month, and then only reluctantly.  I find myself playing many of the tracks 2-3 times in a row. If I could only listen to one type of music for the rest of my life, it would be New Age....if I could only listen to one CD, it would be Voyageur!  My goal now is to get 6 Enigma CD's and put them all in my car CD player at the same time and just &quot;fly&quot; with their music.<BR>By the way....I'm a 60 something grandmother.
0393312836|5.0|A Clockwork Orange is a very intersting novel worth picking up.  Its paradoxical name refers to its political overtones.  A story about an English boy overcome with hedonistic and violent tendencies.  He is treated by the system and trained to become sick when his evil tendencies arrive.  Like many writers of his time, Burgess metaphorically communicates a portrail of our own society.  The Clockwork is a hint towards the mechanical workings of our socitety; with its regular schooling, social groupings, criminal control and government.  The Orange hints towards the rather live working members inside this mechanical evironment; being the people.  The book give question to our larger purpose and mening, testing the bowndries of right and wrong, and moral norms.  A clockwork Orange remains a classic in our generation and will remain for generations to come.

B000005JA8|4.0|There are people who listen to this record and &quot;understand&quot; its low-brow multi-layered humor, much like listening to Firesign Theatre or the humble beginnings of Frank Zappa. Then sadly, there's people who don't. These people aren't necessarily &quot;unhip&quot;, but I'll admit, If I took this album and played it in the car with my girlfriend in toe, she'd wonder just what the heck I was smoking to play this in front of her.<br />So if you're looking for the next Springsteen or Beach Boys, this ain't it.<br />Just maybe, this album is the account of a bunch of very talented, hairy, bored rock and roll guys with a few &quot;ideas&quot; that they let loose on tape. They're brilliant for the fact they risk everything in trying to make art out of dribble. You don't have to know what &quot;Fast and Bulbous&quot; is. You don't have to listen to it more than once. It's not a Coltrane or Beatles record. It's not a graceful production. It's not meant to be 'heady' or intelligent. It's an insane asylum between four sides of vinyl (or 1 long CD in this case). It's electric and eccentric and a big bowl of nothing. It takes ONE play. Either you love it or hate it. NO ONE is going to &quot;Sorta like&quot; this record.<br />Sonic equivalent of a very small VW bug with 20 clowns packed into it. And these clowns are in your speakers. I love this record. If you don't, go sell it to someone who will. You have nothing to lose by trying.<br />Don Vilet's [Captain Beefheart's] mind is not normal nonetheless and this album may lead you to &quot;Lick My Decals Off&quot;, &quot;Clear Spot&quot; or &quot;The Spotlight Kid&quot;. Although anyone would have to admit, there's no song title prettier than &quot;Her Eyes are a Blue Million Miles&quot;. That's later, if you can take this record.<br />For now, let's see if you can handle this record and absorb it correctly. There's always his paintings which go easilly into $3-4,000 each these days.
B0001LJCPC|5.0|I also cannot find that song similiar to Silhouette of Doom, I think it is not on the soundtrack. That is too bad, because that is in my oppinion the best song in both volumes.
B000050FEN|5.0|This is one the best thriller movies I've ever seen. The movie sucks you in at the very beginning and keeps you at the edge of your seat. There's action and the suspense is great, you can't predict what's coming next. And then ending is spectacular and smart. I can't believe someone who can make this great of a movie hasn't made a bunch more great movies.
B0000AUHPG|2.0|A great looking, great sounding DVD filled with beautiful landscapes showcases a movie suffering from seriously heavy handed direction - far too many long drawn out scenes. I got the impression that Leone was trying WAY TOO HARD to make this his &quot;masterpiece&quot;, and with this cast it is a shame that he  obviously tried too hard. His efforts to be dead-serious ended up being funny, or just long and pointless. The cast is filled with big names. Jason Robards, excellent as Cheyenne, the only character I could manage to care about at all. Henry Fonda is stiff and uninvolved, especially creepy in his horribly mis-cast love scene! YUK! And I like Charles Bronson as much as the next girl, but PLEASE LOSE THE HARMONICA! What starts out as weird and inappropriately funny degenerates into ANNOYING and finally PURE TORTURE. And did we really need three minutes of Henry Fonda's character falling to the ground? DIE ALREADY is what I was screaming by the end of this picture. Way too long and weird for any but the devoted cult western fan! <br />The DVD IS beautiful and the music (excepting the harmonica, of course) is very nice. Some awkward voice-over, especially with the female lead. If you love all things Western or are on a vendetta to see all Henry Fonda's movies, I guess you need to see this one. But you may want to bring a book to pass the time.
B0001BKAEY|3.0|well the final chapter in the matrix series has come to an end and it was not what alot of fans expected who were all waiting 4 years to see what would happpen to neo and the gang and it ended and we still don't know what has happen to neo and the gang over there in zion. the brothers have left us guessing as if this is the end or not. in all the movie is nice . a romace a war story and a sci fi mystery. i am hoping for a part four something like matrix 7.0 seeing that neo has finallly found out he is the 6 version of a computer error in the matrix. well i overall the triology is a good one. the story is good the vfx are pleasing but the ending needed work. maybe the bros should take a page from peter jackson on his LOTR trilogy to see visa vi how you should end a trilogy for the loyal fans.
B000003KCU|2.0|A film notable for having a young River Pheonix and Ethan Hawk in the leads.  EXPLORERS starts out interestingly enough with a great premise, decent special effects, scientific jargon, and a likeable cast of young stars, but then it falls flat. Three pre-teen guys (two geeks and a freak) build a spaceship (a very inventive and high concept idea by the screenwriters).  Then, they go off to find aliens. Once the young &quot;explorers&quot; meet up with an alien race who speak &quot;American television&quot;,because the aliens have been receiving the televison signals to their planet, the story becomes vague, muddled and somewhat of a letdown. Also, the alien(s) repeating quotes from film and television programs becomes irritating and old right away. Overall, there are high production values to the film, interesting script ideas, and a likeable youg cast, but ultimately falls short.  For a story that dares to explore, it goes nowhere.
B000089RVX|5.0|1) An EXTREMELY refreshing break of the crap thats on the radio today<BR>2) The most talented music group in the industry<BR>3) A group that plays the most breathtaking songs I've ever heard<br />Anyone who can talk trash about Evanescence needs their head examined. They are not a gimmick, they are just popular. And I've loved their music long before it was popular. Bring Me To Life and My Immortal are two amazing songs that were extremely overplayed, and this has absolutely destroyed what they stand for. &quot;Fallen&quot; (their hit CD) is simple brilliant. The songs have brought out feelings in me I never knew I had. The lyrics are profound, beautiful, and genius. Amy Lee's voice will haunt you, take your breath away, and often times make you weep. I would go through and rate each of the 11 songs on here individually, but that just can't be done. Each is unique and has different values to each individual, something I could never describe. Some of the songs are arguably &quot;depressing&quot; but at the same time are beautiful and unique. Anybody who is not moved by their music is shallow and too lazy to take the time and think about each song and the feeligs it evokes.<br />The style of music Evanescence stands for is debatable. They are undeniably a rock group, but they also have beautiful ballads unlike anything I've ever heard before. Also, the songs often blend in strings and a choir, for a captivating experience. <br />In short, buy this album. It is unlike anything else and you will find out for yourself what Evanescence really is.

B00005JKJA|4.0|This movie was very good.  I really enjoyed that the plot made you think but was not too hard to understand after watching it a couple of times.  If you are still stumped, the DVD has 10 hints to solving the movie which really help a lot!  The music was cool too, and added to the surreal feel of the movie (especially Llorando at Club Silencio).  If for no other reason, the guys who usually wouldn't watch this kind of movie would appreciate the lesbian sex scenes.  Naomi Watts did a good job of playing a bad actress.  Only reason it didnt get five stars was that I thought the man behind the diner was a little bit cheesy.  I recommend the movie to anyone with a compotent brain under the condition that lesbian sex isnt a huge issue with them, because I know that's the sole reason my mom didn't like the movie.
B000003Z12|5.0|I am a huge Journey fan, so i stumbled upon this solo cd by Neal Schon.  I now have all of his cds, but this one's my favorite.  Of some 750 cds in my collection, this gets BY FAR the most rotation.  The record is great all the way through.  It's instrumental so you can work or read to it, but the guitar work is so complex and aggresive it won't put you to sleep.  Still overall it sounds smooth and relaxing.  The strange thing is I am not even afan of this genre (i like not so well known hip-hop like Atmosphere and Blackalicous).  I hate playing the same record over and over, i like my music to stay fresh, but i can't stop putting Beyond the Thunder in my cd player - and neither will you should you decide to buy this record.  You will not regret it.
B00006V9A0|1.0|Nirvana or shall we say NERDVANA DID Ruin rock and roll, because they were the ones influence even more bad rock into our music (Korn, Limp Bizkit, Alanis Morissette, Linkin Park, Staind,  System of a Down and Nickelback among many other 90s and 21st century poseur punk group anyone?) and this best-of album proves my point. Dave Grohl is the only person with talent in the band with his drumming. Every single song Nirvana did(Smells Like Teen Spirit to Heart Shaped Box to Pennyroyal Tea and You Know You're Right) sounds the same and it's the same dull and depressing music that should have came with subtitles. Kurt Nobrain couldn't play an instrument and everything else was lousy, I listened to this at the record store I worked at and I didn't like em then and I don't like it now. Nirvana are wimps compared to real punk legends The Clash, The Ramones and Sex Pistols. Thank god for the band The Darkness has brought rock back to the fullest after what that no-talent nobrain took it away from us almost 13 years ago. The only grunge bands I liked were Pearl Jam, Soundgarden and Alice in Chains, avoid Kurt Nobrain. Eddie Vedder is better!
B0001Z53AQ|3.0|I've been anticipating this album for a long while, and after a while of listening to it, it's grown boring with a few exceptions. The intro, Git Up, is an OK intro. Eminem's flow is awful, but everybody else comes hard. It gets a bit tired after a few listens, but I listen to it every now and then.<br />The next song, Loyalty, is, or could be, one of the best songs on the album if the beat wasn't so MIDI sounding and Bizarre wasn't involved. He just can't rhyme. Obie Trice does a great job in this track. So does everybody else...<br />Hi-Tek provides Bizarre with an amazingly dope beat and as expected, he ruins it. Why make a joke track if you can't be funny? The only funny line was the Obie Trice one. The rest is just a waste.<br />Skip past I'll Be Damned and the Dude skit, and we come to the single, My Band. The beat fits the song well, and at first it's an amusing song, but after a few listens, you start to realize how terrible the beat is and the song gets irritating. What's with Eminem and the midi sounds?<br />I'm actually feeling the U R The One beat, but the subject matter is boring and Bizarre ruins it again. Next is the old 6 In The Morning track, which I never liked too much before...but it's actually an average listen compared to some of the other tracks here.<br />Next is How Come. There's been a lot of talk whether this is about Royce or Kim, but either way, this is Eminem's dopest verse in awhile. Proof and Kon Artis rip it as well. The song after this, Leave Dat Boy Alone, has a terrible Red Spyda beat (he's capable of so much better) and is very boring lyrically.<br />Then we come to Get My Gun. Eminem returns to his Slim Shady style of comedy and violence on this song. The hook is great, you hardly notice Eminem's bad singing, and when he says \\"I'm gonna get my gun\\" you can't help but laugh at his drunk-redneck sounding voice. One of the best songs on the album.<br />The Bizarre skit is sort of funny...an average skit...Then the song Bitch afterwards isn't that great, it's OK for a listen once in awhile but otherwise it's annoying. The next skit, Steve's Coffee House is the best skit on the album hands down. Hilarious. The next song, D12 World, is an OK song...Every member except Eminem spit their usual shock style lyrics for about 4 bars each, constantly switching. It's a good song. Not the best Kanye beat, but it doesn't get annoying.<br />The next song 40 Oz sounds like it's trying to go for a crunk sound...Aside from the beat being terrible, the concept of the song being stupid, WHY did they let Bizarre open a song?? Anyways...<br />The next song is Commercial Break by Young Zee. I was never feelin Young Zee and this song is no exception.<br />Finally, a good beat! The Dre produced American Psycho II is good, but it's not better than the original. Too bad B-Real only spit the hook.<br />Next is an old verse from Bugz, the late member of D12. Produced by Kon Artis, the beat is terrible but it's not that bad otherwise.<br />The last and probably the best song off the album is Good Die Young, featuring probably the best Kon Artis beat ever. Everybody comes hard, including Bizarre for once, too bad Eminem didn't get on this. I understand he wants to let the other guys get their shine, but really it's supposed to be a group tribute to loved ones they've lost. Still a dope track.<br />The album closes with Keep Talkin from the Invasion Pt. 2 mixtape. Still dope after all this time.<br />Overall, this album is just barely average. Right now there are only 4 songs I listen to out of 21. Am I the only one who remembers the days when these people, Eminem especially, had something interesting to say? I can only hope Proof's solo album makes up for this.rwards isn't that great, it's OK for a listen once in awhile but otherwise it's annoying.

B0001Z53CY|3.0|Yo jlennonfan4,  <br />                          NEWS FLASH!!!<br />Guess what?  The reason Eminem and D12 made the song &quot;My Band&quot; was to poke fun at the fact that a lot of people think that D12 is a band...  I think that Eminem and D12 have been long enough in the business to know that they're a rap group, don't you?  Maybe not, since you weren't able to pick up the main point of the song...  I suggest you listen carefully and pay more attention the next time you criticize something....<br />Peace out......
078322611X|5.0|I first saw this film with my father when it first arrived in theaters.  My father loved sports and expected me to do the same, however, I ended up loving the cinema.  We always looked for ways to spend time together and with this film we were able to meet somewhere in the middle.  He got to see a movie supposedly about \\"sports\\" and I got to see a movie period.  I was 12 years old.<BR>  I really enjoyed the film, although it wasn't until about a year ago that I fully understood and appreciated it's true impact.  I am now 27 years old and married.  I lost my father in March of 2003.  I watched this film recently with my wife and was stunned...moved to tears.  <BR>  I don't think (in my personal opinion) there is a more appropriate and heartfelt take on the father and son dynamic.  The acting is dead on and the musical score sould be placed in a museum of American art.<BR>  I hold a new place in my heart for this film and all that were involved with bringing this little slice of Americana to life.  What I wouldn't give to be able to play one last game of catch with my father.

B000002H6C|3.0|Metallica have done better than this album.. yes there are great songs on this album like &quot;one&quot; and &quot;Harvester of Sorrow&quot;. this album was poorly done as for the fact that they just had gotten Jason as the replacement bass player. metallica even said that this album could have been done better. the bass was really lacking as metallica didnt know Jason was to be permanent. I personally think Jason now-a-days can rot in hell for leaving metallica.. he was an awesome bass player. and to think he can hang with Ozzy...pppppffffff... Jason cannot and wont ever be able to hang with the immortal Ozzy!!! jason was metallica and forever will be metallica! yes for those who are wondering I like Cliff way better! cliff is one of the best bass players ever! Jason was great live! he had energy and drive that made metallica what they are today. yes metallica lost there huge drive and f*ck you up metal when cliff died but jason gave them another edge to there music which possibly made metallica better! those of you true metallica fans will hang on to those classic albums like &quot;kill em' all&quot;, &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot;, &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;, and &quot;the black album or Metallica&quot;. those albums were done with power and grace. metallica really knew where they were goin with those albums! Metallica today is great with the new bass player, Rob Trujillo! now Rob can hang with metallica and a great choice!

B000002572|5.0|Boston's 1976 debut album countering both the Progressive Invasion from the UK and disco frenzy back home became the fitting album to commemorate bicentennial mood and filled the need for Americans to get the music of their own that can be really proud of.<br />Reflecting the 70s when progressive sound was trendsetting, the band uses the state of the art techno gadgets and created new genre of rock'n roll. And they used clean high-toned vocal harmonies to get the better of such synth backings. PEACE OF MIND is the typical of such gem creating the healing of our mind. FOREPLAY/LONG TIME is an excellent coupling of progressive instrumental and feel-good pop music. ROCK'N ROLL BAND and SMOKIN' are the rejuvenated mainstream American pop. HITCH A RIDE, SOMETHING ABOUT YOU also have the impressive high-tone chorus. LET ME TAKE YOU HOME TONIGHT well wraps up this album having both soft healing pop and aggressiveness of prog-heavy rock at the latter part.<br /><br />Essential for classic rock fans.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I agree with those who say that the movie departed from the Tolkien in significant and surprising ways, and that's what makes all three of these films so good.  The essential Tolkien - the story (with some modifications), the language, the magical world created whole, the darkness, the heroism, the love that binds the main characters together - which is the true heart of the book - is all fully realized and then taken even further in the three films.  The films are faithful most of all to the central truth of the book:  That the good in the world is worth fighting for, and we all have something to offer - we all have a part to play in that fight - whether we choose to acknowledge it or not.
B0001Z53AQ|5.0|Here is my review on D12s New Album D12 World<br />Track 1- Git Up- A Wonderful opener. A Mix of lyrics, that just makez the song worth listening too.

Sounds like a diss too murder inc. Aint sure.. or Benzino. Aint sure. Good beat, not bad lyrics. I give it a 7/10!<br />Overall- D12s second effort is hot! Very good tracks. Some arent worth listening too, but that is my oppinion! Buy this album! Im sure its gonna sell more than Devils Night did.
B000002JKA|5.0|If I could take one album with me to the afterlife, this one would be it. The musicanmanship is intricate, yet not exceedingly technical, the lyrics thoughtful and superb, and the vocals are top notch for LaBrie. It is more in synch than Images &amp; Words, but looser than Scenes From a Memory, possibly the best piece of work Dream Theaters released.<br />The album begins with the upbeat drum of 6:00, a song about how you need to sieze your dreams before you end up trapped in a mundane lifestyle.  Caught in A Web is a groovy piece, with again great drum work by Protonoy accompanied by Petrucci's awesome 7-String.  Innocence Faded could have come right out of I&amp;W, with LaBrie's vocals hitting the higher notes, as opposed to his deeper growls throughout the album.  <br />Now we delve into the Second part of the album, the trilogy &quot;A Mind Beside Itself&quot;. It opens with chaotic Erotomania featuring a myriad of riffs comprised from past and present albums. Kevin Moores keyboard work is more subtle and less direct than Rudess keys on in later albums. This dims down into the eerie Voices, an almost 10 minute song. While it's an excellent song lyrically, it tends to drag on at points, and doesn't maintain the elegance of the epics found on I&amp;W. The dark Voices transitions to The Silent Man, an accoustic piece that has wonderful melody, and a soothing vocals.<br />The simple and melodic Silent Man is offset by The Mirror, which begins with a bombarding barrage of guitar cruches, killer bass, and haunting keys. This is one of my favorite songs, as it deals with how people place judgement on people without looking at themselves first. It's become my second favorite DT song(the first being Learning to Live). Without even a pause the song flows right into Lie, featuring more awesome riffs, and even more deep vocals from LaBrie. <br />With the next three songs we're given some reprieve, as Lie fades into Lifting Shadows off a Dream, openning with lamenting bass line of John, with some supporting keys from Kevin. The song is beautiful and mellow, and another of my favorites. Next is Scarred, the second Epic on the album, better orchestrated than Voices. It's reminscent of I&amp;W but with a darker tone, as it begins with a funky bass, and enters somehwat of the spooky ambience that made up Voices. LaBrie's vocals are almost perfect, very soft at first, but becoming much ore menacing as the song kciks up into a heavy mode. Drumming is phenomenal, and Petrucci's riffs are awesome, with Moore's key's being percise and not overdone. The song then dims down to the mellow whispers of LaBrie,and then to his soaring cries. The solo is awesome, featuring fast paced guitar work and apprpiate keys in combination, much like The Mirror.  Finally the album closes on the melancholy Space-Dye Vest, an almost polar opposite to the technical and heavy driven opening. This is possibly LaBrie's greatest vocal performance on any CD, it's simply stunning and powerful. The album leaves you dazed and introspective, as opposed to I&amp;W which left you with a feeling of hope and contentment. <br />Simply put, I think every single person should buy this CD. It's beautiful, rough, complex, and simple all at the same time. This album is the definiton of Harmony because it takes all these elemtns and belnds them to create an utter masterpiece. Everyone should expiernce this CD, it's worth far more then the mere 11 bucks, and is worth more than a 1000 listens.
B00009XITP|5.0|A teen girl who lives with her mom wants to find her dad, so she sets off one morning on her own to find and get to know her father. It becomes a massive shock to him and starts to wonder if she is telling the truth. Great, quite unusual and one of my favorites.
0553573403|1.0|I agree though, with all the bad reviews.<br />It took me 2 weeks to read this because I kept throwing it in the corner in disgust. There isn't one truly sympathetic character in the entire book. The author's need to obsess over ever detail appeals to some I suppose, but he should have at least tried to stick to some semblance of realism thru a little bit of research. His incredible lack of knowledge in all things martial led to me shaking my head over and over.<br />The plot appears to be a simple action-reaction device. No real continuity is developed, and no hard distinctions are drawn giving me a reason to root for one side or another.<br />The sex scenes are completely gratuitous, seemingly only there to titillate his reader's baser instincts.<br />The author has not learned that a story can be made finer, a scene more solemn or horrific or suspenseful, by leaving some details unspoken.<br />A few specific problems I had that just jumped out at me for being so unrealistic:<br />Making a midget in poorly fitting armor who has trouble just walking some kind of invincible warrior is utterly ridiculous.<br />Jon severely burning his hands in the zombie fight. Puhlease... the author might at least have lit some cloth on fire and noticed that it is pretty hard to burn yourself from a quick snatch and grab as described in the book.<br />Arya tripping in a wheel rut and breaking a nail after so much physical training which implicitly included tumbling. It is completely unrealistic that she would have been so emotionally shaken as to trip in a wheel rut and hurt herself. Muscle memory is a wonderful thing. That scene was so at odds with the training she'd been recieving, and for the life of me I could see no purpose. It detracted from the story because it instantly invalidated all the hard training.<br />No HEROES.  Not only are their no flawed heroes...there are NO HEROES at all in this book. The closest thing to heroes are Robb and Jon. Robb being some kind of great strategist in command of a bunch of war-hardened veterans is of course beyond belief, because no real context is given that would have led us to believe he has a head for strategy. And Jon is constantly second guessing himself like a ww2 era frenchman.<br />In the end, this book strikes me as being written at a young-adult level in regards to the \\"child-heroes\\" and the simple-minded plot, but with an attempt to make it palatable to adults with it's sex and it's contrived complexities.<br />I suppose I'm spoiled by the likes of Tolkein, Asimov, Heinlein and Herbert. This dreck goes on the \\"target\\" pile for my next range day.trategist in command of a bunch of war-hardened veterans is of course beyond belief, because no real context is given that would have led us to believe he has a head for strategy.

B0000AUHPG|5.0|This is one of the most artistic, stylish, masterful, atmospheric &amp; epic &quot;attention 2 detail&quot; packed movie's ive ever seen honestly...not just for a western, but for any kind of genre! Amazing directing,= in pure Sergio Leone style, smooth flowing in an artistic way &amp; doesnt try to rush anything, but lets u soak up the scenery and atmosphere in an icredible way. But, be warned if u are a type of &quot;Ah, GET ON WITH IT&quot; impatient person this may bore u a bit, but if your reading this u already know SERGIO LEONES &quot;take as much time as u need&quot; attitude. But even if u are that impatient person, give this atleast one viewing, it may even suck u in untill your hooked on this. This is considered by many as &quot;THE GREATEST WESTERN OF ALL TIME&quot; with the runner up as &quot;THE GOOD, THE BAD &amp; THE UGLY&quot; &amp; i gotta tell you.......it aint no lie!!!!<br />P.S. If u EVER loved a western &amp; u aint got this then u dont exist. Theres really no use for me to say BUY this Special Collectors Edition version.... because all u true WESTERNERS HAVE IT IN YOUR COLLECTION ALREADY! Peace.<BR>R.I.P. CHARLES BRONSON. HENRY FONDA.

B00005JLKB|5.0|This is one of the most amazing shows on television.  I love this show!  i have loved superman ever since i was a kid watching nick at nite and watching the movies.  when this show came on i wasn't even  aware of it but i started watching in  the second season and i loved it!  the first season is awesome, really setting stuff up for seasons to come.  the sly references to superman mythology is genius and the writing is awesome.  definetly gets stronger in the last half of the season and ithas been n an upward climb since!  best show on the wb because it is not just some stupid teen drama.  they reinvent the mythology of this hero wonderfully and continue to do so.  definetly buy this and season 2 when it comes out!
B0000542D2|5.0|When I was still in grade school, I remember my brother and I watching 'A Hard Day's Night' just about every time it was aired as the 'Saturday Afternoon Matinee' on the local UHF channel. We loved the film and would play my father's LPs continuously.<br />With the DVD, I am happy to say that my children are now huge fans of the film, the band, and the music. I get at least two requests for the movie each week.<br />The film shows a day in the life of the Beatles during the height of Beatlemania in England. It starts out with the band heading to a studio to perform before a live audience. Along the way the band have a couple of mis-adventures, most of which are caused by Paul's grandfather (played brilliantly by Wilfrid Brambell).<br />Seeing the band during that stage in their carreers is a treat. It was a time before they started to push the boundaries of popular music and the music business.<br />This movie is great for young and old. Even if you are not a die-hard fan of the Beatles, this film is worth watching.<br />The DVD's extras are good. I was hoping for more from the surviving band members, and possibly more performances that didn't make the film. I remember a documentary that was aired a couple of years ago that contained some footage that was cut from the film, and was a little disappointed that it was not included.<br />All in all, this film is one of my favorites, and it apprears to be a hit with the next generation.
0676973779|5.0|I was on a quiet Thai Island when I picked this book up to read... the beginning of my personal journey through SE Asia and India.  Thinking I'd read it over a period of time, I found myself sat in my hammock and delving into the story from cover to cover.  Pi's journey from virtual childhood to forced adulthood was transfixing.  His search for spirituality through some of the world's oldest religions to his harrowing experience on the life boat with a menagerie of wild animals was incredibly moving.  The shaping of a man... his suffering, his victories however small, the author related the story of Pi the man so well.  The descriptive passages enabled me to close my eyes and see what I was reading as if it were a vivid picture rather than just words on a page.  What an inspiring read!
B00000099Y|5.0|when i first heard this album i was shocked i about pooped my pants. alot of people ask me what my favorite song on the album is and to tell you the truth i have no favorite,i dont think that anybody can have a favorite because they are all exellent. everybody talks about the drummer of tool like he is the best member and the most talented i agree he is good but MAYNARD IS THE BEST. he is just so versatel if he wants to slowly rock you he does it or if he wants to scream so loudly that your balls go into your throat then by gholly he does it. so if you want to listen to the most thought provoking music in the world.this is the album to buy.(two thumbs and two big toes way up)
B00008EY9G|2.0|OK. They tried to make something really different here. But making a wild turn next to the ending of the film, a turn that made clear that all that happened before a lie (or a kind of dream) was inexcusable, absurd, and made me feel like an idiot. (maybe that was the intention of the producers...)<br />Technically, the movie is very good, and acting is top notch (except by the father of the little guy. Watch his expression of &quot;disbelief&quot; when he sees a victim that had a baseball bat stuff into his throat.... But, even feeling a kind og guilty pleasure watching this movie, I can not help but feeling cheated.
B0001AVZA8|3.0|This movie seemd like one Hollywood Cliche after another.  I thought Diane Keaton looked great, and one can never get enough of Jack Nicholson misbehaving.  However, Keaton's character is the typical older woman who is bitter and resentful of men her age who show interest only in the younger woman. Her character never shows any such resentment towards those younger women themselves, nor does she acknowledge that she has actually raised a daughter who has turned into one of those younger women dating an older man. That sort of irony seems to be lost on Keaton's character. Perhaps she might admit, also, that if she had made better decisions about men when she was younger then she wouldn't be alone when she was older. Or perhaps the movie should just preach a tad bit less about how men are evil for liking younger women but how there's not a single thing wrong with younger women liking older men. These types of romantic comedies, and by type I mean totally unrealistic, idealistic misrepresentations, do more harm than good because they further exacerbate the already hugely problematic and offensive belief that anything wrong that's ever been done has been done so by a man.  There were a few funny lines and themes such as when Nicholson's character was in the hospital discussing Viagra, but this movie could have been better.

B000148KK2|4.0|The arrogance of fan(atics) who accuse a musician of \\"selling out\\" their fan base by trying something new astounds me. Diana has a right to try what she wants and those who don't like it don't have to buy it. That's how music grows and changes. It's called innovation, and without it we'd all be listening to the same song all the time. Honestly, reading the reviews of a lot of CDs on Amazon, I have reached the conclusion that hard-core jazz fans are some of the most closed-minded people around. Of course, now this review will be rated as \\"not useful\\" by all those who don't like this CD, a typical response of the closed-minded to a different opinion.<br />That said, this is definitely different than Diana's previous disks. Small wonder that those who eagerly awaited a clone of her past work are disappointed. This is a very listenable disk. Open-minded listeners should enjoy it, though perhaps not as much as some of her past work. Her vocal and piano skills shine as always.
B00004RF98|5.0|There are so many qualities of this movie which make it entertaining. For one thing it seems to bring out the best in most of the members of the cast. This is particularly true of Jean Hagen and Donald O'Connor who turn in stellar performances. Of course Gene Kelly is always in top form.It also helps that SINGIN' IN THE RAIN is a good story for movie buffs about the transition from silent films to talkies. The strong supporting cast includes Debbie Reynolds, Millard Mitchell, Cyd Charisse and Rita Moreno.<br />The singing and dancing had to be superb due mostly to the enormous talent available to the directors who were Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen. Donen also directed SEVEN BRIDES FOR SEVEN BROTHERS. Surprisingly SINGIN' IN THE RAIN received only two Oscar nominations which were for Best Supporting Actress (Jean Hagen) and Best Scoring of a Musical Picture.
B00005QXXO|5.0|I cannot even begin to explain the emotions that are able to sweep over me when listening to this cd. I own all the Radiohead cds and this one is fueled with amazing songs that will make you want to buy more of their albums. The songs on the cd are all beautifully arranged. The recording is brilliant. All the instruments can be heard crystal-clear and go perfectly with Thom Yorke's vocals. Along with live versions of studio tracks such as &quot;National Anthem,&quot; &quot;Morning Bell,&quot; &quot;Spinning Plates,&quot; Idioteque,&quot; etc., there is also a beautiful, unreleased acoustic track at the end called, &quot;True Love Waits.&quot; <br />Honestly, words to describe this cd do not exist. If you have any knowledge of what music truely is, you will not be disappointed.

B0001BKAEY|2.0|The fan boys would have you believe that this movie was good... and if you think it wasn't then you are stupid and just didn't understand it.<br />I understood it.

0140277447|5.0|It has been well known that Japanese inhumane army has brought an unprecedented catastrophe to the world, especially to the rest of Asian countries during the WWII. Nanking massacre is particularly a disastrous tragedy in the history of the human being. During Japanese army's occupancy of Nanking, more than 300,000 civilian and Chinese P.O.W.s were brutally slaughtered and thousands of Chinese women were killed after gang rape. Unfortunately, in Japan there are still quite a few right-wing politicians and ignorant people insisting to deny these crimes and are trying to distort history by claiming that Japan liberated Asian nations and Nanking massacre is being faked. How ridiculous! If you really want to know what barbaric Japanese army did in Nanking during that hellish six weeks, please make every effort to get this book. The brutality shown in the book is far beyond any human imagination. (...)
B0001BKAEY|2.0|How bad is this movie?  Let me count the ways....<br />I rented this film in hopes of enjoying the end to what I felt was a rather well portrayed storyline.  Like most I loved the first one and enjoyed the second.  As opposed to many I spoke with I liked how the second movie got a little deeper into explaining the One and the Oracle and the grand scheme of things.  The storyline got more intelligent and I enjoyed that.<br />Revolutions isn't good if you're smart and understand the whole story.  You don't need to watch this movie more than once to realize its just bad.  Not over your head.  Not too intelligent.  Its just a really bad bit of filmmaking.  Couple points:<br />*We know the original actress to the Oracle died and was replaced.  Who cares about that in relation to the overall plot?  My problem with the Oracle wasn't her change of face it was how insignificant she became to the story.  In the first two she was all-knowing and understood the grand scheme of the Matrix.  The final installment?  She makes about as much sense to the story as that goofy Trainman.  Like what I found in most of the film, she seems to only provide a tie in to finishing the story up really fast (as with her somewhat anti-climatic *breakthrough possession* in Smith that we've grown bored with from films such as 'The Exorcist')<br />*Did the writers just come up with the idea of Zion for the last movie?  The defense of that place makes no sense if you give it more than half a thought.  We're told in the first movie that the machines can't get to Zion because its hidden and the approaches are heavily defended.  Ok, that makes sense.  But Revolutions shows that Zion's defenses are just as weak as the Sentinels to EMPs.  So tell me; do the machines have no EMPs?  They're able to create and run the Matrix while besting the thinking humans in the world.  But only after a single ship blows an EMP practically all of Zion is defenseless.  The machines couldn't figure that out?  Again, we finda haphazard &quot;just pretend that's what happens&quot; in a film that is trumpetted as being a 'thinking' film.  I think the plot is stupid.<br />*Sentinels don't have guns?  They can only use those lazers to cut doors and jump-start machines?  Hows about zapping those gun firing humans?<br />*Who cares about Neo being able to simply blow up machines at will?  They don't explain why he has to go to the Machine City or give much build up to how he figures that out.  The first two films say bupkiss about the city but, on a whim, it becomes integral to human survival.  I hope the writers survive unemployment.<br />*'I'm the Frenchman.  I have Neo and the fate of everything in my hand.  I have a bounty on everyone and here they are!  In my grasp!  I'll finally get what I want.  I'll win!  Oh.  Wait.  They put a gun to my head.  I guess I'll do something non-french and surrender.'  STOOPID!  Be in love and threaten a Frenchman with a gun and watch him do nothing but write himself out of the movie.  How come?  Why'd he capitulate so easily?  Did he NOT think they'd pull something like that?  Is he new?  <br />*The second film really placed different levels of thought to the story.  It explained that all of everything happening was expected, like a computer program.  There were no suprises for the machines or the Matrix.  Even the One and, as we're told, Smith are expected.  Oh?  Then how come Smith grows so out of control if he's part of the equation?  Because Neo's powers grew so much faster than expected (allowing him to be uber-dude) so did Smiths?  Somehow I don't find balance when the entire Matrix and Machine City are threatened by this unexpected turn of events.  What was unexpected was just how stupid that idea is.  <br />*So only fit, hot chicks ready to kill for guys populate the post-apocalypse future?  And I'm supposed to support nuclear disarmament?  BRING ON THE BOMBS!!!<br />I'm tired of driving a truck through the gaping wounds of this movie.  I didn'tdislike it because I just don't &quot;get&quot; the others or didn't pay enough attention.  I dislike it because its a bad movie.  The writers didn't explain enough and were in a rush to get it over with.  They tied up loose ends sloppily.  It doesn't take a genius to figure out the story, or multiple viewings to 'get with it'.  What it takes is to have some sense of taste to realize this movie is garbage.
B0001Z53CY|1.0|This CD is the worst thing I ever heard. Sounds like some country white boys tryin to rap with there white jokes and white attitude. Just cause eminem came out with Dre dont mean nothing because after listening to this cd you'll know he's just another goofy white boy that acts white.
B00008EY9G|1.0|Man, this is mean. After watching for almost one hour a group of people being slaughtered one by one in a cheap motel during a thunderstorm, we reach the conclusion that the killer can not be one of the four remaining survivor up till this point. And, surprise, it´s really not!<br />Why? Because nothing that happened in the last hour was real! Yes, that´s right! All of that was happening inside the mind of highly mentally sick killer, who had &quot;multiple characters&quot; inside himself, some of them good, some of them bad and one very bad, a real serial killer. In order to not be executed, the judge must be convinced that the very bad one does not exist anymore.<br />So, who is the killer is simply not an issue anymore! That´s righ! You´ll feel like a suck..r after watching the turn of events. And, by that, it will be too late to turn off your DVD, so you´ll end up watching it until the end, anyway, while the writers, the actors, the director and the producers will be laughing their ars..s off.
6305014140|5.0|The first time I saw this... it was an acquisition of my older sister who got it on special (and not from Amazon). There were some pros and cons of watching the movie when about thirteen, the main reason being partly a result of not having noticed that the movie was R-rated and that it also had sexual references. But, happy-go-youngster that I was then, I still plodded on with it (open-eyed and quickly shushing the machine through the first half-hour - well, it's not exactly something you want to watch with your parents, is it.).<br />However, after a few years of loving Neon Genesis Evangelion and then returning to Tolkien mania with fanfiction, Harry Potter with the release of Book 5, and a generous gift of the Gundam Wing Series from said same sister, I decided to come back to Ninja Scroll. And whoa! It was beyond great! The plot is balanced so nicely with just enough character development to satisfy your cravings whilst also supplying violence in the amount to be perhaps gruesome, but quite necessary to both balance the tension in the plot and also keep me convinced of the storyline (well, they are devils that Jubei's fighting). The characters were all wonderful in that they managed to blend so well to support the plot. My only qualm was that Jubei always seemed to reach near death with coughing up blood and everything, and yet he still managed to get up and walk or climb away from the deathscenes with grace. Maybe the script writer noticed this too, because in Ninja Scroll: The Series (Vol. 1), they showed him bandaging himself up.<br />Highly recommended, even for those people who don't like violence or rape scenes. Ninja Scroll needn't be just about violence, nor just about the characters. It's a movie that both groups can enjoy. The graphics are believable (Kagero's assault is believably drawn). And as for the bishounen yaoi fans? Well - choose it! Yurimaru is a bit arrogant, but he's full of angst and of course is also quite beautiful (and hilariously huffy)!
B00005JLR2|5.0|This is up with The Lion King in quality and is modern Disney animation at it's best, unlike the shockingly bad 'Brother Bear'. <BR>Treasure Planet also has real touches from old Disney like Peter Pan, you could see the characters in a line-up with these classic icons.<BR>I went with a group of adults and we ALL found it very funny and yes, I was on the edge of my seat at one point!<BR>I don't understand any criticsm for this - and I' not one of those Disneyoids who likes any Disney film either.
B0001CNRS4|5.0|This is one of those movies that if you dont like to dance or don't know how to move... you wont like it. I always hear people saying how they don't like it but if you dance with all your heart and it is a part of your life (like it is mine) you will love this movie. I personally think that the people who dont like this movie are just jealous or don't understand that dancing for some people is life and are willing to do anything in life to live their dreams.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Kill Bill is what is hailed as the much anticipated &quot;4th film by quinton tarintino&quot;. If you don't know who quinton tarintino is, then I feel sorry for you. For the rest of us I need only mention the titles &quot;Resevoir Dogs&quot;, &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, And &quot;Jackie Brown&quot; and then you will understand the anticipation this new film has for us big time QT fans.<br />So as the long-awaited 4th film, we find Tarintino taking a new dirtection... firslty, this is Kill Bill vol 1, with Vol 2 having just been released in theaters as of this writing. Seeing the first volume immediatley shows us that what QT had blanned was large, stylish, and visionary! The fact that The lead star Umma Thurman actually particiapted in much of the conceptual work behind the film only serves to further display why this film came together so brilliantly.<br />Kill Bill, as it's appropriatley called is a tale of revenge at it's most basic. Umma Thurman Plays an ex Assassin, who was betrayed at her wedding by her former boss. The plot throughout the movie leaves some gaps to be further explored in the next film, but plenty of detail and background is given to all the characters throughout the course of the movie (a trademark of tarintino is brilliant character depth). Once comming out of a comma, &quot;The Bride&quot; as she is called (we never get to hear her name in the movie - it is bleeped out!) goes on a path of vengence that will leave a thick trail of blood in it's wake.<br />Harking back to old martial arts films of the 70's the mood is sometimes made to feel corny intentionally. Oddly enough not only didnt this bother me, it made the movie more fun and more enjoyable. What's amazing is QTs abillity to switch moods in the film from being epicly dramatic, and almost philisophical in nature (like many old sammuri movies); to being goofy, and corny and almost poking fun at itself. Also we are treated to scenes that have wild western feels, as well as refrences to other old genres. The film is filled with LOTS to dwell on and think about.<br />Beyond that we have QT's typical directorial excellence. Vissually, Kill BIll is probably one of the finest works I've ever seen. The movie has more style, flair, and wit than almost any other I can think of. QT just has a way of always finding some new place to put the camera... some new trick to use that u werent expecting. An entire 10 -15 minute scene in the movie is fully animated in japanese style! The use of black and white and other little artistic ideas of QT make this movie an absolute pleasure to watch. If nothing else this has to be one of the most creative and unique films you'll ever see.<br />Finally, this is QTs first attempt at making an action orientated film. The fight scenes are really well done, and in the climactic battle we see umma thurman single handedly fight 60 plus men (all with sammuri swords) - and slaughter them all! Even the first time through, I had to watch that scene twice! QT also has a way of bringing the action together with many moments that are (typical to his style) nothing more than witty diologue.<br />IN the end, some people wont like this movie just because it's too &quot;wierd&quot; for them, or just not their kind of film. Those who dont like QTs style are likely to not be impressed. But for me, and many others, Kill Bill Vol one was an AMAZING movie, on many levels at once. The variety of themes, the amazing visual style, and the excellent audio (thanks to the RZA from Wu Tang Clan who produced the soundtrack)... this movie really surprised me by just HOW good it was.
0385510438|3.0|The story is engaging in the beginning, but it then moves into several unrelated characters. A large chunk of this book looked like page fillers to me, especially pages full of information about the black woman, having lunch with her every Thursday, etc. I believed all along that Mr. Grisham would somehow connect all the information towards the end and it would make sense then .. but alas that didnt happen.<br />The story line is good though and it would have been great if he had packed this up into a fast-paced 200-250 page something instead of tonning it up with extraneous information that really didnt add up with the way the conclusion came about.<br />I suggest that one should read this book with lots of patience and if you feel somewhere along the middle of the book that there is lot of information that doesnt seem central to the book, dont worry .. it doesnt matter even at the end.<br />To be frank, Mr. Grisham gave me the impression that he was the bored editor of the newspaper like Mr. Willie Traynor.
B0001I55OC|1.0|Dear God!!!! I don't normally write online reviews. Doing so just isn't my thing. But this movie was absolutely HORRID!!! The book was SO MUCH better. Now, Hollywood is pretty much known for butchering novels through movie adaptations, but this was relentless. The incredible detail and enlightening, thoughtful entertainment of Crichton's novel is WIPED OUT and PARED DOWN so that Paul Walker can have a starring vehicle. I have nothing against Paul Walker, but this just wasn't the movie for him. In fact, I envisioned a totally different cast for a story of this magnitude. This movie goes beyond oversimplification of the novel. On it's own, it's just BAD. It is a 1950's B-movie masquerading as a big budget studio production. I might have found it entertaining if it didn't try to take itself so damned seriously, which it was sort of doomed to do since it was SUPPOSED to be based on the Crichton novel.
0451169514|4.0|i tend to enjoy more meanigful books as supposed to thrillers by the likes of Michael CHrichton, but It was surprising.  IT succeeded in entertaining me with its thrills as well, almost an even greater extent, by the amazingly well-developed characters and the literary talent King displays.  this book transformed me into a huge fan of Stephen King.
B0001GL3K4|3.0|Had I reviewed this film immediately after watching it, I may have given it four stars, because it was fast-paced and fun. And there's boatloads of talent in the charismatic cast, but much of it is unexploited.  Outside the troubled Emma Thompson/Alan Rickman relationship, which was nuanced and credible, most of the cast (even the fabulous Liam Neeson) was wasted either on serious subplots that missed feeling authentic or attempts at humor that were severely overplayed.  The inconsistency in the film's viepoint made it feel very disjointed; one minute we're seeing a broad, indeed ridiculous vignette about an over-the-hill rock star (his butchered cover of &quot;Love is all Around&quot; by the Troggs made me so nostalgic for the real version I really thought it should have been included somewhere in the soundtrack); the next minute devastated widower Liam Neeson (always a delight, even in this unworthy role) is trying to connect with his young stepson, and then that turns into a farce about the stepson's improbable infatuation with a classmate. Watching the &quot;deleted scenes&quot; portion of the special features provided some insight into how the film became such a mishmash, and should offer a cautionary lesson for other filmmakers.
B0001BKAEY|5.0|The Matrix Revolutions has everything an ending part of a trilogy needs to have - some drama, epic scale battles and the ending point of the long conflict. It is very complex visually speaking and I believe that it is the Matrix movies that set the bar of how CG should be used in movies. The Matrix Revolutions is set in a rather darker mood than the previous two movies as this time most of the film revolves around the real world and real deaths. There were some things I would have liked shown different but overall it is a very enjoyable movie if you don't ask it to be &quot;The Godfather&quot; deep in acting and drama and &quot;The New Bible&quot; on philosophical side. It is superb at what it is - high production values Sci-Fi/Action movie. If you are capable of staying unbiased and perceive The Matrix Revolutions as it is, you should definitely like it. Can you think of a better movie in this genre? - I know I can't (and no, Blade Runner, 2001, Aliens ans similars are NOT of this genre).
B000002LQR|5.0|Blood Sugar Sex Magik is the CD that put the Red Hot Chili Peppers on the map.  The perfect blend of funk & Rock driven by incredible muscianship is undeniable.  As always Flea's smooth, fast bass, gives them an element that no band can emulate. And Johnny Frushante's (sorry if i buthchered the spelling) guitar ranks among the best ever; particularly on \\"I could've Lied\\".  This albums raw energy funk driven tracks give it great orgionality but the true masterpieces are the three ballads \\"Breaking the Girl\\" \\"I Could've lied\\" and \\"under the bridge\\".  For any Fan of rock or funk this CD is a must have that you will listen to over and over again
B0001IN0DA|5.0|I just got my WM XX DVD today, and while I have not watched it yet, I can say that this is the best packaged DVD that the WWE has ever made.<br />I won't take the time to bog you down with match by match ratings of all the matches. I actually was in NYC for this event and as a fan that has always wanted to see wrestling in MSG, this was a dream come true.<br />Wrestlemania XX, lives up to the hype. For me personally it was everything a &quot;Mania&quot; is supposed to be. I have been a devout fan of the WWE since WM 2. I thought this event was very strong. The production was great and the celibration of 20 years of this event was truly amazing to behold. <br />From the beginning for me, it was very emotional. Watching clips of past WM's was unbelievable. As I thought about some of my favorite matches over the years. While many are quick to site wrestling's &quot;fakeness&quot; I thought to myself, how these moments made me feel as a fan that really believes in what Vince and Co. does. I am one of the people that &quot;Get's it&quot;!<br />What can be said about the event that has not already been said. The expectations were very high for a showcase of this magnitude, and it did not disapoint. From the opening match with John Cena winning the US Title, to the incredible atheletic displays during both of the Heavyweight Title matches, this was truly an AWESOME show.<br />It simply goes without saying, if you are a fan of the WWE this is one DVD that you must have in your collection. <br />The term &quot;Special Edition&quot; gets thrown around a lot in the DVD world. I can say that this truly is a Special Edition and one that derserves that title. I think it's awesome that the &quot;Mania of Wrestling&quot; Documentary and the &quot;WM's 10 Greatest Matches&quot;  are both featured. Truly and incredible collection.<br />There is always much speculation about whether Vince listens to the fans or not, and I do not know if he does or does not, but one thing is for sure.Vince and the WWE really knew what they were doing when they put this collection together.<br />WWE fans enjoy!<BR>-Mark
B0001A79JO|5.0|This album is awesome!  The problem is with many people who buy it expecting to hear psychobilly.  This is a side project w/ members of other psychobilly bands.  This is supposed to be a mix of new wave, punk, and just good old fashioned rock n' roll and it delivers everything that Kim Nekroman (guitarist) promises.  All the tracks are great, especially the surf rock-esk track Horror Beach.  <br />If you like The Nekromantix you'll like this album.  If you like Blondie... you'll like this album.  If you like any punk, rockabilly, or psychobilly get this CD.  <br />Contrary to popular sceptism, there are no links between Patricia's attitude and Gwen's attitude from No Doubt.  I've heard No Doubt, and I've heard the HorrorPops and I can honestly say that people who claim there is a likeness in attitude are just plain wrong.  Patricia has a style all unto her own.
B00009Z576|2.0|There are bits of songs that actually sound good, but you have to dig into the songs deeply to find them.  Into the Lens has got to be one of the worst songs ever written.  Just completely awful.  This cd hurts my ears, and to date, I still haven't been able to listen to it all the way through, which is a shame because this is the only one of their cds that affects me this negatively.  Save your money.
B0001L3MI0|3.0|In a nut shell the movie was good, not bad, but not spectacular ether. I like the SPECIAL EFFECTS and Aliens. The movie is a kind of WAR OF THE WORLDS meets TOP GUN (for those who have not seen it) buy it for your sci fi collection, but don't pay too much. Enjoy
B0000C0FJB|5.0|I don't know what these people are talking about. The audio quality is fine. If you have ever heard the original un-mixed audio, you would say otherwise. And by the way, most recordings are EQed at the show, and THEN mixed at a studio (with the exception of the two board recordings, which are recorded directly from the PA mixer).
B0000DD7LC|4.0|When I first bought and listened to this cd, I simply hated it. The only song I truly liked was &quot;You don't know my name&quot;. But after a lot of 'listen tos' while prepping up for work, a date or while cleaning the house, it started to grow on me. I really like this cd. However, I only listen from track 5 (skip a song or two) to the very end of track 15. Tracks 1-4 have yet to grow on me. Most favorites are: Diary, Dragon Dayz, You don't know my name, Interlude, and the very last song (track 15). WOW! That's 5 out of 15. Nonetheless, still a good cd.
B000000993|5.0|This album is pinacle of progressive metal in the states. it's got a vibe to it that continues throughout the entire album. Although, that exact characteristic can make it seem repetative; but don't get me wrong. This album is anything but boring. The bass in my opinion is beyond any bass I've ever heard. It's extremely heavy and intense. I think if you like that trait alone you should pick up this album. Although, the good aspects of this album are endless.<BR>For one, the lyrics. Although weak at parts they are angry and pure, so if you don't like that this album may not be for you. Songs like the swamp song and intolerance truly extend the full meaning of my point. With the lyrics, comes an odd spin of a industrial rock style to the singing that i think maynard james keenan makes the best of. It's kind of like that guy from third eye and trent reznor mixed together (i know, makes no sense). Although, hes got a voice inseparable to his style and i believe that the important part. However, if the voice doesn't do it for you this album won't, so if you haven't already check the samples above.<BR>The drums are a grand display as well. Although not demonstrated to their fullest i think the overall feel of it was amazing. If, you'd like faster drums and love tool than get lateralus instead, but if well measured and steady drums are you're style then this is right up your alley. In addition, the drums and the bass match beautifully and i think any hard rock fan would agree after hearing this. <BR>Finally, the guitars and the overall sound of the album. The sound and the guitars connect alot and thats why i mention this. The guitar have a creepy quiet ring to it until the chorus usually comes out. Then, the progressive metal begins. Ingenious in all it's simplicity. I loved it in other words. But still it's not for everyone. It you like bands like NIN and have maybe picked up a Manson album then you'd already know the sound. And i think you'd would love it, but if you'reconfused by the term progressive metal, than this isn't for you just yet. Although, this album in my opinion is incredible it differs from person to person. I hope i helped anyone out there.
B0000508U6|5.0|Hotdamn! This cd rocks. I didn't know who Coldplay were until I heard the news that actress Gwyneth Paltrow had married the frontman of the group Coldplay. I was like &quot;Coldplay&quot;! However, I heard the song &quot;yellow&quot; years ago but didn't know the name of the song-my rendition of it was horrible so no one knew what the hell I was singing-and didn't know the name of the person(s). But I do now and, I'm the proud owner of Parachutes and A Rush of blood to the head:-) I'll recommend the Pope to buy their albums
B00003CX9Q|5.0|E.T. is one of the greatest films of all time.  It takes you by surprise.  You feel everything E.T. is feeling.  After the movie, it shocks you that you found heart and compassion from something that looks like a mud sculpture.  E.T. also has some of the greatest performances from child actors than in any other movie.  In this film, we see little Drew Barrymore making a stellar breakout performance as the little sister of Elliot in the film.  The new 20th Anniversary of E.T. special edition definately is better than the original cut.  The effects sparkle like never before.  The DVD is a wonderful thing to add to anyone's DVD collection.
B000002UD0|4.0|...the ruling on the field is over-ruled.  Walls and Bridges has commonly been judged an inferior work created by an alcohol blotted burn-out.  No doubt that there was some serious intoxication going on.  But this is great music, played with energy, and sung sublimely.  The lush style is no cop out, but a genuinely fascinating  take on the same trail that Roxy Music would later blaze.<br />There are many who praise the anguish of Plastic Ono Band, and just about everyone embraces the inconsistent, but strongly compelling Imagine.  This album might be his best solo, perhaps because his talent was still strong, and, for once, he was guided solely by his own judgement. And John Lennon is no doubt one of the great talents, and I wonder why anyone would deny themselves.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|It was wonderful watching a movie with well-drawn characters that have personalities and humanity with foibles, strengths, fears, and a sense of time and place in history.  I enjoyed the \\"quiet\\" scenes where we are able to get to know the men of the Surprise.  The friendship between Aubrey (Crowe) and Dr. Mautrin (Bettany) is a glue for the whole movie.  The state of their friendship is a barometer for the state of affairs for the mission of the ship.  Being a musician, I loved the scenes of them passing time making music (and the raucous music of the crew as well).<br />Max Pirkus plays the 13-year-old Lord Blakeney with amazing skill.  His maturity reminds us of the time when children were not condescended to as creatures of little capacity and less responsibility as they are today.  Some may find such adult expectations of such a young person abhorrent, but given the life expectancy of the times to 13 was to be about a third of your lifespan.  They had to mature early and Lord Blakeney is a wonderful character with emotional strength, courage, and intellect beyond most adults.<br />There are two major battle scenes and a storm scene off the southern tip of South America that provide the action scenes of the movie.  They are wonderfully done and are quite rousing.  The scenes of surgery on the ship are filmed in a way that is not visually grisly, but so emotionally intense that you will want to look away because of what you might see, but don't.<br />I think it is always wonderful to capture a past time and place accurately.  While I am not a historian and I am sure that those historians who pay close attention to this period will find things to complain about, I did like the details they captured about the living conditions of a crew aboard such a confined space.  I don't know if all the details are right, but it was fun to watch a movie with details that added to the understanding of the plot rather than making one roll one's eyes at the implausibility of it all.<br />A great adventure bordering on an epic that is populated with people you would like to get to know and few you would treasure as friends..<br />A great adventure bordering on an epic that is populated with people you would like to get to know and few you would treasure as friends.
B00008WG3U|5.0|I've noticed reviewers complaining of the anti-bush content in this album. In case you did not realize, that IS what punk is about. Not wallowing in the pain of being dumped. Having a good time and trying to make a change. Saying &quot;f**k you&quot; to the leaders we don't agree with.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Whether you love him or hate him, it's hard to deny that Eminem is the best rapper today, and may be the best rapper of all time. His clear diction, rapid fire delivery, innovative beats, and clever lyrics make for very entertaining music. He didn't win a Grammy for nothing. <br />This Grammy Award winning CD is awesome and powerful.  Songs like The Way I Am and Marshal Mathers are sung with power and conviction, while the more humorous The Real Slim Shady and Who Knew are provocative and clever.  And Eminem's live performances of these songs are even more powerful and compelling.<br />I rate this CD a whopping SEVEN stars: <br />The Way I Am **<BR>The Real Slim Shady  **<BR>I'm Back **<BR>Kill You *<br />I also like Marshall Mathers and Who Knew but not quite enough to get a star.  Some fans will be surprised to see that Stan didn't get a star.  I like Stan, but it's not a song I want to hear a lot like the others. <BR>---------------------------------------------------------------<BR>Ratings: CDs are rated simply by how many good songs are on the album. Great songs get two stars, and good songs get one star. Songs that get no stars are those that I might like but not enough to give it a star or ones I find boring or actively dislike. CDs are not penalized for songs that I don't like because they are easy enough to skip over. There is no maximum number of stars a CD can get, but of course the more stars it gets, the better the CD. <BR>As with all reviews, these are my subjective opinions on the album.
B00005JMCW|5.0|This was one of the best films I saw in 2003. The performances from Curtis and Lohan were outstanding. I really enjoyed it and I can't wait to buy it on DVD! It was a great movie for all the family. I really like teen movies so this was one for me. I encourage anyone who has not yet seen it to do so straight away! You won't be dissapointed!
B00003CXCT|5.0|The Star Wars movies rule, period. I love the original trilogy and the prequels as well, and I've been a fan of the series since I was very young, and the movies are still great. They really defined what people get excited about movies over, and few other film series have the kind of story and characters that draw you in as George Lucas's space epic masterpieces. Never mind that this DVD contains the special editions of the movies rather than the original versions. The films are still great, and if it's any consolidation, Lucas did listen to complaints and change Han's cantina shootout with Greedo back to it's original form. We probably still have the cheesy musical number in Return of the Jedi, but I think I can live with that. I will definately be pre-ordering this set, because I've been waiting for it ever since I bought my DVD player. Definately the must-have for all REAL Star Wars fans.
6304698623|1.0|If you liked the book, don't get this movie.  I don't know why they named it A Little Princess since the story is so different. I bought the VHS version thinking it would be good seeing what book it was based on. Boy was I wrong.  In the movie Sara goes to New York to be at a boarding school to be safe while her Dad goes off to fight in WWI.  In the book she is sent to London to learn to be a lady while her father stays in India apparently to do nothing and invest in diamond mines. In the movie Sara does naughty things all the time. You would never catch Frances Hodgeson Burnett's Sara doing such a thing.  There is also a feminist slant to this movie where you find 10 year old girls hanging on to wet brick walls by one finger. Sara does not act like a princess, all she does is go around boasting that it is every girl's right to be a princess. It is not. Girls should act like princesses, be polite, kind and ladylike, not go around feeling haughty and better than every one else. Maybe the acting is suberb, I don't know. I've probably watched less than 20 movies in my 16 years, but I was very disappointed with this one.
B00003CWL6|5.0|This film is one of a kind. After seeing this film last week, I was left with a hole in the pit of my stomach. It left many questions in my mind, and most of them cannot be answered. In my view, a film that makes me think after I watch it is second-to-none, and this film certainly delivers in that aspect.<br />I was amazed with the vivid imagery in this movie, as well as with the symbolism. However, what makes this film the best of 1999 is the acting. Kevin Spacey shines as Lester Burnham, and Annette Bening (Carolyn Burnham) isn't far behind. Supporting cast members such as Wes Bentley (Ricky Fitts), Thora Birch (Jane Burnham), Mena Suvari (Angela Hayes), and Chris Cooper (Col. Frank Fitts) only add to the drama of this film. I think the most special aspect of this film is how all of the characters intertwine in a way that is believable, yet fantastic at the same time. I congratulate Sam Mendes for his direction of this film, as well as Alan Ball for writing it. I don't think it could have been any better.<br />Rated R in the U.S. for strong sexuality, language, drug content, and violence, the film obviously deserves its rating. However, none of the causes for the R rating are overbearing, and all of them add to the plot-line of this film. While I don't think that this is a film for children, I would suggest that adults should view it with an open mind. I believe that the traits which many of the characters in this film have are found in many people around the world. Perhaps that is why this film hits close to home for so many viewers.<br />While billed by some as a \\"comedy-drama\\", I don't see anything about this film as funny. Sure, there are some comedic moments, but by the end, those moments were all but forgotten when faced with the grim reality of the conclusion of the events portrayed in this film.<br />If you want to watch a light-hearted film with some elements of comedy and some elements of drama, don't see American Beauty. But if you enjoy films that makeyou think, and are entertained by an excellent cast, excellent directing, and an excellent screenplay, this film should be at the top of your list.
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|Famed cult director Tim Burton's \\"Big Fish\\" was greeted by generally positive reviews, but some of the negative ones were scathing - dull and preachy, belabored, pretentious, long-winded, strained. So, as a Burton fan, it was with some trepidation that I saw the movie. I'm glad I did. It's got its weaknesses - some of the fantasies don't work as well as Burton had hoped they would, I suspect. But, for the most part, it does work as a delicate, almost magical allegory. It also contains some great performances, especially by Albert Finney, Jessica Lange and Helena Bonham Carter.<br />What if, when you were a kid, your father filled your head with fantastic stories of his own youth? Stories about his encounters with a very big fish, amazing exploits in a war, encounters with a giant, his travels to a town that exists in its own space and time, etc.? And you, as a young man, with your limited imagination, could not accept your father's filling you with these stories? What if you could not relate to him because you felt his whole life was a lie? And, finally, what if you discovered that his crazy stories were not, after all, that far from what really happened? What would you do?<br />These and other questions are what confront Will Bloom [Billy Crudup] when he returns home from New York City to the rural South where his father, Ed [Finney] lays dying. Hostile and angry, Will confronts his father. [Of great importance to the story is Will's mother [Lange], who loves Ed unconditionally and is enchanted by his wild tales. But, of course, she loves Will unconditionally as well.] <br />As Will fights Ed, we see flashbacks of the young Ed [Ewan McGregor] living out these improbable tales in sequences of amazing visual detail. At first, Will may have the upper hand, but as we watch, it is Ed who wins the battle and our hearts. He may not have always told the truth, but it is his life, not Will's, which is the more heroic and worthwhile. Will, we learn, merely clungs to surfacerealities, while Ed has fully embraced the realities that lay just beyond our reach.

B00005176F|5.0|Somewhere between the fall of Brit Rock and the rise of stateside homegrown grunge in the mid 1990's Blur got lost in the uh,er....blur. It's ashamed because during that decade our boys from Colchester U.K. produced seven consecutive thematic albums that are the equal of any pop group, American or Brit, during any era. Damon Albarn, Blur singer and lyricist posesses the keen satirical eye of the brillant Ray Davies, chief songmeister for the legendardy Kinks.  Indeed Blur's preoccupation with theme of disaffected working class youth in the UK follows the royal bloodline of Brit bands started by the Kinks, the Who and Small Faces in the 60's, and endured through the 70's and 80's with second generation of bands like XTC, the Jam and Squeeze. So Blur is vangaurd of the third generation (1990s) that presents the perils and rebellion of yet another generation of youth, in post-colonial Britian. Like many of their forbearers of Brit rock Blur's cameleon-like capacity to constantly reinvent themselves, may also be their greatest flaw. Woefully underappreciated guitarist, Graham Coxon is the glue that holds Blur together as they leap through a bracing tour de force of stylistic shifts. The broad stylistic range presented in the &quot;Best of Blur&quot; makes one wonder if it's really the same band playing on all of the cuts. In other words, Blur is often too clever for their own good. The amazing part is that Blur has the restraint to never over-reach and implode under the weight of their far flung musical ideas, as so many of their predecessors were apt to do. It is problematic for a band like Blur to develop a readily indentifiable signature sound, which seems to be a prerequisite for success in the pop world. Stay dull and churn out formulamatic songs if you want to get to the top and stay at the top. Blur is the antithesis of template, cookie cutter rock.<br />If you listen to the 18 tracks presented on the &quot;Best of Blur&quot; it's hard to deny their lineage at the top tier of Brit pop bands, in the 40 year span since the first British invasion. What is more remarkable is that a great deal of Blur's early work, including the masterwork, &quot;Modern Life Is Rubbish&quot; is under represented in this collection. Two of my personal favorites or the blue-eyed soul of &quot;Tender&quot;, and &quot;House In the Country&quot; which ranks with the Kink's &quot;Waterloo Sunset&quot; as one of those quintessentially British melancholic statements of class resentment. &quot;Charmless Man&quot; reworks the thematic palette of another Kink's classic, &quot;A Well Respected Man.&quot; &quot;She's So High&quot; is an incursion into the territory of the Syd Barrett edition of Pink Floyd; just think of ultra-echo psychedelic sensibilities of Barrett's &quot;See Emily Play&quot;. &quot;To the End&quot; and &quot;It's Over&quot; almost sound like Morrissey, without Morrissey's grating tendency to wallow in weepy self pity. During the course of this musical journey, you will hear neo-psychedelica, baroque horn arrangements, northern soul funkiness, Beatlesque harmonies, power pop guitar rock, wistful ballads in the tradition of Burt Bacharach and Jimmy Webb, and of course, perhaps the most adrenalin charged 2 minutes of rock and roll ever recorded, Song # 2.  &quot;Song #2&quot; ranks with Love's &quot;7 + 7 Is&quot;, and Moby Grape's &quot;Omaha&quot; as proof that rock and roll can not only save your soul, but on rare occasions, rock and roll can blow down the walls of Jericho.e top tier of Brit pop bands, in the 40 year span since the first British invasion.

B00002MZ4W|5.0|No matter what you think of Fiona as a person (she is quite eccentric in more ways than one) it is undeniable what kind of talent she has. Her music is like liquid poetry, each word and note sliding right into the next one, not as if it was written that way, but destined to be so. Her voice is thick, and sultry, filled with the heaviness of regret and pain that far exceeds her age.<br /><br />Her metaphors are amazingly clever and powerful and yet so easy to understand. Her use of rhyme, puns and alliteration get me every time. Lines like \\"my pretty mouth will frame the phrases that will dispprove your faith in man\\" hits a spike with each consinant. \\"You can use my skin to bury secrets in\\" manages to sound both sensual and creepy. She seems to know herself so well and has no problem letting us know the truth.<br /><br />If you enjoyed \\"Tidal\\", there would have to be something terribly wrong with you to not like \\"When the Pawn...\\" just as much, if not moreso. I just hope that she continues the trend of each album blowing the former out of the water (if her label ever actually lets her release Extrodinary Machine)!
0393312836|4.0|Quite an opening line, eh?  And Anthony Burgess didn't stop there.  He creates an atmosphere, an entire surreal environment that I both knew could not exist but wondered if it might be possible.  <BR>Each of the three sections of the book open with this ambiguous line, &quot;What's it going to be then, eh?&quot;, and with each usage I came up with a new interpretation.  Example A: the first portion of the book is spent watching 15-year-old Alex and his gaggle of friends take out their aggression on nearly everyone they meet.  A man walking down the street is beat so badly he bleeds and can't get up off the street, simply for being a &quot;teacher-type&quot; and carrying an armload of books.  Burgess uses this repetitive opening line as bait...I had to keep reading just to find out what shape it might take on the next time around.<BR>One of the most amazing aspects of this book was the language.  Burgess creates his own vocabulary, replacing random English words with his own concoctions.  Alex didn't have friends, he had &quot;droogs;&quot; they didn't drink a little at the bar, they drank a &quot;milenky&quot; bit.  Sure, it takes a while to figure out just what in the heck Alex is doing or saying, but it's well worth it.<BR>So, to make this short and sweet, read the book, be stumped by the vocab, try to not be too appauled by the violence, and decide for yourself what that opening line means.

B00009MECF|5.0|Jim Carroll's autobiographical life story is the basis for this cult classic of the early 90's. Leonardio DiCaprio plays Jim Carroll a  poet writing basketball star at a Catholic prep school  in Manhatten  who's future comes tumbling down when he gets addicted from glue sniffing to heroin. Mark Wahlberg co stars  as Mickey his partner in crime as they skip school and do drugs, Jim realizes his future of becoming a pro basketball player are gone when he sees a local kid that he used to run with that decided to stay clean makes it to college ball. Eventually his mother kicks him out and he is saved by a black preacher an ex drug user from the streets takes him in. A powerful story about addiction  and the negative affects it has on one's dreams. Leonardo DiCaprio's  performance was amazing &amp; makes you wonder how accurate it was of Carroll. The soundtrack also is amazing, essential to collection &amp; a must see film.
B00008OLIC|5.0|This is one of the best albums for 80's metal. It is a great improvement over Girls, Girls, Girls, and over Theatre of Pain as well. The songs are heavy and wild, with a pop sheen that made it acceptable for commercial audiences. Almost the entire album is written by the genius Nikki Sixx with his guitar playin' bandmate Mick Mars. Even though there are three ballads, (well maybe two and a half), they are all good. Two of the se songs went top ten and two more went Top 40. That shows that even pop audiences went for this album. And I can't say I blame them.

I love the way Jame's voice sounds all schreechy.<br />For Whom the Bell Tolls: Yet another unbeatable song.<br />Fade To Black: The best Metallica song ever. What can I say?<br />Trapped Under Ice: A fast, uncomprimising metal track.<br />Escape: A very good, no frills song<br />Creeping Death: A very good song. Very fast and catchy.<br />Call Of Ktulu: A great instrumental.<br />All in all, this is the best Metallica album ever. Anyone who doesn't own it is not a true headbanger.

B0000634EW|4.0|This is one of the many bands formed by ex-Pantera members. I enjoy it greatly. I just think that there are too many ballads. that is why it got 4 stars instead of 5. Phil Anselmo sings, Rex Brown plays bass andd COC's Pepper Keenan plays guitar. It sounds quite Black Sabbathy, with a southern tinge. Lysergik Funeral Procession and Beautifully Depressed are among the best songs on the album. I like it.
0553277472|4.0|This book is widely read among people involved with higher education. When you read the book, it becomes obvious why. Although it doesn't teach much about motorcycles, it doesn't give us a general idea of how we could live our life.<br /> As near as I am able to determine it  has three basic plots. The first and most usual is a father and a son going on a motorcycle trip through the northwestern states. They ride the motorcycle through the country on a long trip back to their old home and anywhere else they feel like visiting. Second is the father trying to find a piece of his personality that he lost as a ward of the state. His previous self had been a collage Rhetoric teacher at some school in Montana. He lost it in a very interesting way. The third and most time and space consuming plot isn't really a plot but more like a discourse on modern life.<br /> Should you venture to read this book don't do it for the first plot or the second plot. They take up only a very small portion of the book, like say, two paragraphs every chapter. The big reason to read it would be for the ideas and thoughts of an insane or  maybe genius collage professor trying to get the world to make sense to himself. If you're looking for action look somewhere else.<br /> The reason I liked this book had to do with the ideas. In every chapter he would say something that would make sense and be worth writing a book about in and of itself. He did; however, have one great though that cost him a personality. Now the main idea in as little space as I can manage and still have it make sense.( To me at least)<br /> It is generally believed that the world is made up of two things; subjects and objects. Objects being physical things and subjects being thoughts or Ideas. If we refine this further we get the romantic and the classical , the hip and the square, the poet and the scientist, radical and conservative, democrat and Republican. One side based on hard facts and the other on ideas and feelings. Each side has its good parts and nether one is necessarily bad. It comes to me now that before the professor lost his personality he was one and afterwards he was the other. What he came up with was a third party. He called it quality. It is some kind of force or reaction that creates the subjects and objects. It defines what they are.<br />To understand this we must first try and define exactly what Quality is.<BR> <BR> Quality is what makes 007 better than Spongebob Squarepants (which it is by the way). Quality is why we like to eat beef instead of beans. But what is it? We like different things for different reasons. Why is a salty fry better than a salty soup? If the Quality of a fry goes up depending on how much salt is on it does that mean that if you add salt to Cheerios they will have greater Quality?\\"  SOOO, Quality is different depending on what the object is. Quality is not an object or a subject, it is something else entirely.<br /> If you think about it (for a while) you can see there is some logic to it. If nothing had quality we wouldn't care what we watched on TV because all shows would be the same, none would be better than another or worse than another. You wouldn't care what food you ate as long as it gave you nutrients, we would be Borg. There would be no bad because there would be no good. And if so there could be no God.    2 Nephi 2:13<br />If none of this make sense then try reading it again after you read the book.<br /> I can attach several interpretations to what exactly this Quality could be. Among them are free agency, the Holy Ghost, a conscious, or maybe even God. Really, it is judgement or the ability to judge. Which is comes closest to Agency I think. It kind of throws a whole new perspective on why we needed free Agency and why we couldn't live in the garden of Eden. The book give numerous examples as to how this third party can apply to every part of our life from living with technology to collage life.<br /> Between the lines of this Trinity of Object-Quality-Subject are hundreds of small pieces of other brain-blowing wisdom. He covers environmentalism, city v country living,   motorcycles v car travel, and many others subjects. Most of these are deep enough that it is best to take a break so you can think about them for a while to get the full potential of the book.<br /> Going back to the Quality of the book(pardon the pun); the writing style was a little hard to follow and it will never be a great literary masterpiece in that effect. He uses abundant allusions to Classical Greek philosophers namely Plato's Discourse on Phaedrus( which is what the professor calls his lost identity) and a working knowledge of them would be useful. I say again, do not read this for action, story line, or motorcycles. It has very little in regard to these areas and if I knew anything about Zen I guess it would probably have little to do with that either. He also uses words that mean the same thing unless you define them the way he tells you to. It really has a substantial mucilaginous vocabulary throughout the work.<br /> On a final note this book is a really good one if you like that kind of thing. It has been studied by many collages including BYU. It is great if you know the Greek Ideas but is really not a \\"fun read\\" in the normal sense. You have to think about it and it may not be relaxing the way most books are supposed to be. You shouldn't read it all at once or even very much of it at a time. It is full of Ideas not all of which are necessarily true. Remember to put every thing you choose to believe to a prayerful test. In my opinion he had something worth thinking about under all that rhetoric as do most philosophers. Read the book, but only with the right state of mind and take your time.
B00005JLRT|1.0|Prepare to have your finger on the fast forward button at all times during this movie. Where do I begin? Poor script or lousy plot? Here's a taste: The Romulans use expressions like &quot;Dead in the water.&quot; Hmmmm, did it ever occur to the writer to at least try to make this comic book of a movie believable by having the Romulans speak as if they weren't born on Earth? <br />I would vote this as one of the worse Trek movies I've seen. Hopefully this will be the last movie based on the revamped series. Maybe it's time to resurrect Captain Kirk (along with a different director, producer and writer). <br />Not much as far as a story goes. Captain's evil clone out to rule the universe. Sort of like Austin Powers meets Trekkers. Story was utterly contrived and holes all over the place, for example, Data goes to rescue Captain Baldy, but only brings along one emergency transporter doohickey. And I'm asking myself, why didn't Data bring two? I mean the thing's the size of a Chiclet. <br />Watch the Enterprise TV series instead. Far superior and it's free.
0385335482|4.0|Becky Bloomwood is just like me...she loves to shop! i thought it was sooo funny how she always thought to herself &quot;i could win the lottery, and i could by these new shoes with the money&quot;. I loved this book, but it did get a little annoying how she didnt have that much common sense with her money skills. I would recommend this book to Girly Girls, because this is that type of book. I love how the author puts in bank notes from the bank saying like &quot;you owe 237 pounds&quot;. Oh, and by the way, this book is set in London. I cannot read the sequel to this...&quot;Shopaholic takes Manhatten&quot;. So, overall, i rate this book *4* stars !!
B0000VAFO0|5.0|This movie is absolutlly great from the opening scene to the end, full of action and sci-fi/horror.Whats so great? To start the gunplay is good but the sound puts it over the top every time a bullet would go off you would here that thump in your speakers alot like a real gunshot other movies (most) have been unable to produce a good bass effect with gunfire this one does it great.Back to the movie O.K. its vampires vs. werewolfs sound cheesy,well thats becouse the two have not been on screen succesfully in a very long time,its pulled off here awsome,with a really great story,great special effects,and characters you actually care for thats rare in this genre of films anymore!With its wopping DD5.1 and good picture quality DVD you cant go wrong I recommend this to many.Also May 25 04 there is a unrated version being released with 12 min.add. footage you may want to rent now and buy the unrated copy May 25 there is a link to it here on amazon.Great film
B0001I562I|5.0|I saw this movie some 20 years ago when it was released to the movie theaters. The cast selection was good so was the script. I have bought this movie an am glad that no dialogue was edited out (unlike some other movies I've seen.) It would ruin the quality of the movie if the Disney censored some of the words from this film. I always like a good science fiction film, but don't be dubbing in or out any words. I love Joey Cramer's acting, he is a natural in this film. Joey Cramer was great in a 1987 movie called The Stone Fox with Buddy Ebsen, look for it when it comes out on DVD.
B000008LIX|5.0|Therapy?'s Troublegum and Infernal Love are two of my all time favorite albums. Its quite the mix. Lyrics can be quite dark and broody, but they pair it with such upbeat riffs. Quite the combination. I highly recommend Therapy? to anyone.
0833567357|5.0|As a child I spent hours drawing complex worlds and maps from what I learned in this book.
0887307280|4.0|Pros: Easy read, exposes pitfalls, many helpful ideas and many paradigm shifts, excellent!<BR>Cons: Challenging concept for my business of one. No Index.<br />This is an easy read that took me two days to get through. It's simple, repetitive and just the way I like it. But by no means simplistic. To me, it is well written, when the author gets their ideas across quickly and makes them seem easy. The book gets personal about the author as it tries to relate itself to the reader, yet shows a sense of writing maturity in it's simple delivery of so broad a topic. It also gets personal about you as you discover that your business is a reflection of you.<br />A mixture of experience and facts, blue prints and rules told in a conversational story with a semi-fictional character. This style of using a third party character to clarify and reinforce the ideas worked well with me. It helped balance and pace the lessons with a fine sense of timing and added perspective. The book is informational, motivational and even funny at times.<br />Gerber sets the stage by prefacing the four ideas that are the basis of the book's lessons. He identifies and compares three personalities being The Entrepreneur, The Manager and The Technician in us and shows us how and why most businesses fail. He identifies phases of the entrepreneurial business as infancy, adolescence and maturity and the pitfalls of each. He covers six rules on how to shift from working `in' your business to working `on' it. And goes over the three activities to help it evolve being, Innovation, Quantification and Orchestration, systems to blueprint your business. He covers the Business Development Process and to think of how to turn it into a franchise that is a saleable Turn-Key business. He then explains the seven steps to developing your business, which he covers in detail but some didn't inspire my confidence, as they are large subjects in themselves. Like, `Your Marketing Strategy' or Your People Strategy'. But theydo develop a framework from where to start and the questions to ask yourself. He constantly helps focus us by asking excellent thought and direction provoking questions.<br />The book packed with many useful ideas and principles if you decide to buy into them, however is also a way for him to sell his services. By occasionally positioning his company or website as a source of answers to some of the questions the book poses is a great form of self-promotion, however they may be disguised in a story. Some thoughts that came to mind while reading were, why not just find and utilize a mentor? Success leaves clues. I struggled with the though that all businesses are started with one thing in mind and that is to sell it for a profit. The book has many paradigm shifts like this one that challenge us to look at our companies in a different light. Only when I realized that I didn't have to sell my business (If I happened to build an IBM) did I understand the idea. I'm still struggling with finding a compelling vision of how to turn my particular service business of one into a salable entity. Maybe I need to visit his website and enlist in the services he offers. Maybe I just need to find a few successful role models within my business. I will read it again in a few weeks.<br />I would have liked to see an index in the back to help find needed references quickly. Maybe a future publishing might get one?<br />A healthy experienced perspective and a plan to help build a successful business life.
0316236551|5.0|I love all of Emerbeley's books but this one was a particular favorite of mine. It goes into how to draw all sorts of faces from regular people to clowns, movie monsters, and animals.
B00001OH7P|4.0|I'm not a huge Bowie fan, but any fan of early 70's rock should have this.  Suffraget City is worth the price of admission alone, and the album is solid throughout.  An easy addition to the &quot;essential&quot; list.  The CD version sounds great, too.
B000148KK2|5.0|Yes, believe the hype, this is a fine solid album! Diana rocks!
0061015725|5.0|This writer continually amazes me. I have virtually every one of his books and have never regreted buying a single one. This one is equally fascinating, both as a dramatic tale and as hard science behind the fiction, for nano-bots are most definitely on the way and, yes, they could spell as much trouble as salvation for us humans. Read the book and you'll see. This book, like all other Crichton books, is up there with sci-fi greats like &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;, &quot;2010&quot;, &quot;Puppet Masters&quot;, &quot;Mona Lisa Overdrive&quot;, &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot;, &quot;Snow Crash&quot;, &quot;Cyber Hunter&quot;, and many more.
B000148KK2|5.0|I have all of Diana Krall's CD's.  Her voice is lovely and clear on this new CD, at times, her phrasing is exactly like Joni Mitchell.  In fact, I thought Diana's rendition of &quot;Black Crow&quot; is one Mitchell wishes she had performed!  The more I listen, the more I really like this jazzed up and heartful version.  It is very interesting to hear other phrasing, that you can instantly recognize as true Elvis Costello (if you are a fan, as I have been many years) and to see how Diana is progressing as an artist.  I definitely recommend this CD!
B00005MP58|5.0|Its really marvelous. The cast is outstanding, especially Mr. Colin Firth(he is such a handsome Mr. Darcy!). Its worth having it in your DVD collection.
0790731894|3.0|While this movie seems just mediocre at the start, partially due to the hero role that Steven Seagal is put into, after the first twenty minutes it greatly improves.  When the James Bond like scientist proves Seagal's character wrong we finally see that this movie has hope.  Once Seagal's character falls to his death at 30,000 feet, the movie loses its stigma of just another action movie and opens a new avenue to the remaining characters.  This then forces Russell's character into a lead position, allowing him to gain respect by one of the nation's top military strike teams.  What really made this movie seem interesting was how it veered from the original action movie storyline, to a suspense action movie.  Overall, this is a movie that I can, surprisingly, watch time and time again.
0156027321|4.0|Yann Martel's Life of Pi is a masterful novel.  Martel's witty writing captures the reader's attention after the first chapter.  Pi's journey across the ocean opens everyone eyes to the struggles man can endure and overcome.  Pi's journey and struggles make you believe in a higher power.  Pi over came all of his hardship's thru faith.  I would recommend this book to anyone who would enjoy an in lighting read.
B0000542DH|4.0|I've heard the comments on the movie.  People going on and on about the extreme violence.  What many fail to grasp is how this movie is a satire on violence.  Satire is when some exagerates certain aspect of culture so that it can be seen for what it truly is.  In this move, one can see our facination with violence and how it is perpetuated by the media.  Violence is not the underlying theme, it is the media.<BR>Watch this with an open mind and enjoy the symbolism behind it.
B0001ENYKS|1.0|This band is better than Nickelback, but then again most bands are.British hype bands, man...remember Menswear? I can see by your face that you don't.Franz Ferdinand are slightly better.
B0001HLVS2|4.0|I've just finished watching the widescreen DVD of Master And Commander: The Far Side of the World and am beginning to realize that, like most if not all film adaptations, this movie serves as merely an overture to the books upon which it is based.  Throughout the movie I found myself wanting more development, to know more about the characters and the time period, and more action.  Of course, this film has plenty of action to offer, waging war on the high seas and Perfect Storm-esque scenes.  However, there is something lacking in this movie that gives me the feeling that it is simply a one-dimensional preview of what the O'Brian novels are about.  That said, I am very eager to read the novels as soon as I get the chance, but if this film were to stand alone, I would have to say that it's a tease.<br />Now, the reasons why I gave this film four stars.  The cast is very impressive.  Down to every member of the HMS Surprise's crew, I was continously impressed by the authenticity the cast provided to this period piece.  I was skeptical about Russell Crowe, not expecting much more than the usual soft-spoken, stoic hero.  He fit very well into the role of Captain Jack Aubrey, who was mercurial enough to allow Russell Crowe room to exert himself a little bit.  His interaction with Paul Bettany, who charmingly portrayed the ship's Dr. Stephen Maturin, was so intriguing to the point that I did not understand why such emphasis was placed upon Russell Crowe's character and not Paul Bettany's--the two are at the center of this movie.  Only after I did a little bit of research on the books did I realize that O'Brian's story is based on the adventures of these two characters.<br />Unlike many films set in very particular time periods, this movie did a wonderful job at achieving that authenticity, not just by the cast, but through costumes, the excellent score, exquisite language of the script, special effects and, of course, the sailing ships.<br />This film left me with the very distinct cry of \\"I want more!\\" that can be both irritating and exciting.  I am not sure whether or not there is another film in the works, but it would be ridiculous to leave the ending open as it is.  However, I also was left with a strong curiosity for the books which, I would imagine, is what the filmmakers would like to say is the point of the movie.distinct cry of \\"I want more!\\" that can be both irritating and exciting.

B000002A33|5.0|I know of two criminally overlooked albums in the 90s-and then again a busload which were \\"simply\\" overlooked. <BR>  Those two are the eponymous album by Mad Season and \\"Dust\\" by the Screaming Trees. <BR>   The thing about the 'Trees is that for years it was anticipated they'd deliver a brilliant album and for years it wasn't happening. A true riddle really, since all the necessary elements were there: an incredible singer, and a truly great band to back him up. Yet, if you listen to their earlier albums the mystery gets solved. Internal band strifes, bad producing, or simply the chemistry not really coming together were the factors responsible for those rather \\"so and so\\" early efforts. <br />    Once all the components were just right, the result, in \\"Dust\\", was exactly what many people were hoping for:<BR>absolutely stunning. <br />   The thing is that by then, noone was expecting anything much from the Trees and thus this masterpiece went largely unnoticed, when in fact, well, in fact it was one of the very best albums of the whole decade! <br />   But it gets more interesting actually. \\"Dust\\", despite what many people think (in their desire to categorise everything) was not just \\"another grunge album\\". It probably had as little to do with grunge as Soundgarden did. What it was, was a gorgeous bluesy but unmistakably rock album with a capital \\"R\\". <BR>   But that alone isn't what makes it so great. <BR>   What makes it stand out is that it's one of those albums where the intensity of the music and the singing is so capturing that it's irresistible. \\"Dust\\" isnt one of those albums to listen to a few times and put it away for good. It's without a doubt an LP that you will come back to many times for years to come because it leaves a mark on<BR>the listener like few albums do. <br />   Mark Lanegan gives here the performance of his life. The moody and often very melancholic songs are<BR>delivered by Lanegan in such a way, you feel you have a good friend over telling you his sorrows... The band go one better, and dress the whole thing up with some seriously heartwarming rock melodies, of the grandiose kind, songs that qualify easily as rock classics. <br />   Basically, it's futile to try and describe how good \\"Dust\\" is. Or maybe there's not enough superlatives i could think of.<BR>If you're looking for truly timeless music, this album will serve you more than well.
B000060MMI|5.0|A friend of mine had me listen to this CD.... I was instantly hooked. I had to go get the CD... Now that I have been listening to this CD for a few days non-stop in my car I want to pick up more of their music. The music is very catchy and it is hard to resist.... This coming from a fan of Megadeth, Metallica, Iron Maiden, ect.....
0140072187|4.0|From his beginnings training as a Huey pilot, through his war experiences to the end of this account of what war does to men, Mason's writing grips you. This is mainly due to his frankness and openness in not only describing what he saw, but how it affected him. Anyone who can hold a readers attention through a detailed description of helicopter flight training deserves credit. This book gives you a sense of how it must have been to serve in VietNam as well as a sense of how war impacts on people.
B000069CWE|5.0|This is the greatest remix for any album all time. Get this without a doubt. A must have for Linkin Park and all music lovers.
068484267X|4.0|This was a great book. One of the best books i've read about hardships that people went through during the times of the war. I love reading non fiction books because it lets me put myself in their position and makes me think about how hard life would be in those days. I usually dont hear about many stories about Irish familes and what they went through. I hear about Jewish or American familes. Turns out that Ireland had many poor areas and didnt have much money during the war. Frank McCourt and his family lived in Ireland during this time and they went through many diffuclties living. Especially with a father that is an alchoholic and uses most of his money on drinks. if you love reality books and you like to know how people used to live, like Frank McCourt, than i recommend you read this book.
B00005JMJ4|3.0|I usually enjoy snail pace movies with minimal dialogue and long periods of &quot;meaningful&quot; silence, yet this movie was somehow... dry. And SLOW to the point of being irritating. Granted, there were a few gems (electric curtain scene in the morning, low shower nozzle, ad production scene, etc), but the rest wandered off and formed an incoherent jumble of garish colours, neon lights, night clubs and bad karaoke. Even the dialogue was disappointing, especially for an art movie (&quot;life is hard... but it gets easier... marriage is hard too... one day you'll find yourself&quot; - semi-direct quotes). One word about Murray's performance though: phenomenal.
B00003CXAE|5.0|Frankie Avalon singing the one song in the scene he does is the best scene of the movie.Frankie has been touring the US with the show reprising the same role.If you like Frankie then you will like the scene he is in.
B0000C83YJ|5.0|I was a little in doubt about spending my money on this cd, since I've had a copy (not this version), and I've thrown it away, but I really like That's the Way, this was such an important record to me, I'm a big Boy George fan, and I think the record is passing the test of time, Miss me Blind is a great song, the extras are good, and even though I'm no specialist, it does sounds better, I think it's a most for fans and a nice introduction for newcomers to the world of Boy George and Culture Club.
B000059GEH|5.0|&quot;How To Marry A Millionaire&quot; is a comedy story of 3 girls living in a penthouse searching for meeting and marrying wealthy millionaires.The movie is alot of fun.And if you want to know &quot;How To Marry A Millionaire&quot; and if they do marry millionaires with their schemes then you will enjoy this movie.The movie is Marilyn's best movie.The movie was very popular that there was a syndicated TV version of the same name &quot;How To Marry A Millionaire&quot; starring Barbara Eden in the Marilyn role,Merry Anders in the Bacall role,Lori Nelson (1st 39 episodes) in the Grable role and Lisa Gaye (in episodes 40 thru 52) in the Grable role.
B0001Z53CY|4.0|1. Git Up - (5/5) I really enjoyed this song. It has a good tempo and pretty good lyrics. Good first track, it introduces the style of the CD.<br />2. Loyalty - (3/5) Decent. Has a nice techo sound in the background that fits in well. Manages to keep you listening to it though.<br />3. Just Like U - (4/5) Brings us back to the Eminem we're used to. The rest of the group keeps the song dirty though ;).<br />4. I'll Be Damned - (2/5) Has a nice old school feel to it. Lyrics could have been better, and the chorus could have flowed better.<br />5/6. Dude (Skit)/My Band - (5/5) We all know this song by now. It has a tendency to make people laugh when they hear it, plus the end is funny. I still love it.<br />7. U R The One - (4/5) I like this song alot. The chorus flows alot better than some of the other songs, and the beat is catchy.<br />8. 6 In The Morning - (1/5) One of the worst songs on the CD. The beat doesn't change at all between the chorus and verses.<br />9. How Come - (4/5) Good beat, better lyrics. I like the message in the song too. Flows VERY well, one of their best songs on the CD.<br />10. Leave Dat Boy Alone - (3/5) Kind of a stupid song, but that's the D12 style we've all grown accustomed to.<br />11. Get My Gun - (5/5) Funny as hell. Great fast song, great beat, funny and good lyrics. The chorus is great. Excellent representation of traditional D12.<br />12/13. Bizzare/Bitch - (5/5) One of my favorites by D12 ever. Great job by Eminem on the sped rap. The chorus is funny as well (Wonder who'd have guessed?).<br />14. Steves Coffee House - (-10/5) ....What the hell was the damn point of this....Don't listen to it.<br />15. D12 World - (2/5) Not what I expected for a title track. Repetitive beat, boring lyrics. Not very good at all.<br />16. 40 oz. - (10/5) Hands down the greatest song I've ever heard by D12. Slightly repetitive, but still great overall. The lyrics are top notch.<br />17. Commercial Break - (1/5) They aren't good at skits, they should leave their skills to music. <br />18. American Psycho 2 - (4/5) I love the rock guitar with the rap beat. It plays well. It has a good beat and Cypress Hill does the chorus well.<br />19. Bugz 97 - (1/5) Skit...<br />20. Good Die Young - (4/5) The chorus doesn't mix at all, the voices clash. The beat for the song is good though, so I left it at a 4.<br />21. Keep Talkin' - (5/5) Funny diss to Ja Rule. I'm glad they made this. The song could totally suck but it would still deserve a 5 for who it's written towards.
B000089CJI|4.0|The Postal Service's &quot;Give Up&quot; is one of the more refreshing and original albums I have heard in a while.  My preferred playlist of music ranges from progressive rock (Yes, Kansas, Dream Theater, Queensryche, Pain of Salvation), to classic rock (Pink Floyd, Boston, Eagles), to some of the better recent and current mainstream music (Radiohead, Tool, Coldplay, Foo Fighters, Incubus, Chili Peppers, Queens of the Stone Age, Sublime, Smashing Pumpkins).  The music of &quot;Give Up&quot; is very well written and has a strong melodic presence.  The vocals are not perfect -- while on about 6 or 7 of the album's ten tracks, the lyrics and vocal performance are very good, there are some spots where the lyric writing seems forced and the vocal performance is mediocre, and does not align well with the music.<br />Overall, however, this is a very strong album, with some major emotional points.  I especially like the melancholy and ambient  &quot;The District Sleeps Alone Tonight,&quot; the bright and upbeat &quot;Nothing Better,&quot; and the ferocious and energetic closer &quot;Natural Anthem.&quot;

Totally predictable...<BR>The Acting?  Worse than my little neice's grade school production...<BR>The hour of my life watching this?

0790740443|5.0|I loved this movie.  This movie plot has been done before many, many times. Intimidating fighter is thrust into different culture and learns to value it and realizes what he has been missing all this time.  What I liked about this movie is the programming the soldiers went through seemed realistic and very possible. I think most people that make movies with the same plot always make the mistake of have the main characters changing too much. This has always seemed unrealistic to me, and quite frankly a little insulting.  This movie lets you see the changes in subtle little ways Kurt Russell acts.  I would say subtle describes this whole movie.  Instead of pounding points into the viewers face, it lets you make your own conclusions on how you would feel if you lived a similar life.
B000002A33|4.0|Everytime I listen to &quot;Screaming Trees&quot;, I'm amazed they weren't as huge as others in the genre, especially with this album. It's almost too good. I love &quot;Sweet Oblivion&quot; also, but &quot;Dust&quot; is just one of those albums that you hope you're blessed enough to hear in your lifetime. &quot;All I Know&quot; was the almost hit from this, however each track is a stand-out, and the album as a whole is excellent. Any fan of the band, or the great voice of &quot;Mark Lanegan&quot;, or classic grunge needs to hear this. I'll be playing it until my &quot;Dying Days&quot;.
B00006J9OT|5.0|Dianne live in Paris is must for all the jazz lovers.<br />The charismatic presence, her velvet voice, her skills pianistic, supported by a wonderful ensamble.<br />Paulinho da Costa that legend is part of it. The recording is superb in the Olympia of Paris, that temple of special significance for all the superstars that have performed there. Also you must buy the DVD, because this is a special event.<br />Don't miss both of these gems.
B00004Z459|5.0|how could you not love this album, linkin park is not comparable at all to the other so called &quot;nu metal&quot; bands.<BR>i mean come on, lets review these songs shall we:<BR>papercut:best first song  to start off an album since guns n roses' appetite for destruction and U2's joshua tree.<BR>one step closer:best concert song.<BR>with you:intense<BR>pts. of authority: great song with the rapping and chester singing,they are a great combo.<BR>Crawling:might be the best song on the album<BR>Runaway:great lyrics.<br />by myself:that great combo shines once again,it's amazing how they sing so fluently together.<BR>In the end:i dont need to say nothing.<BR>a place for my head: second but very close to first best concert song ever created<BR>forgotten: great indie style rapping,great bridge.<BR>Cure for the itch: great beat while your driving, girls love it.<BR>pushing me away:great ending to one of the best albums ever created.<BR>all this talk about mainstream music is non sense,dont hate on lp just because they started off better than your favorite band ever did,or if they ever will.take it for what it is,awesome music and original sound.
6304696566|5.0|Ethan Edwards, an ex confederate is to his own way, an outlaw. But I'd really like to make a crossroad in the analysis. Doesn't Ethan belong to the dinasty of the mytical hero? In the purest sense of the term. His origin is not very clear. And suddenly he appears, so he leaves at the end. In this sense his efforts for searching his kidnapped niece are an epic fight against all the obstacles.<br />And the turning point that makes that film so extraordinary, is the decission which prevails when he finally finds Debby and almost kills her. In this sense it's a personal choice. Through all his trip he has established his own code. He kills Putterman because it has to be done, and forget all the ethical reasons.<br />But when he goes to rescue her with the group, and finally saves her, you notice he isn't very satissfied with the result.<br />At last, all the people experiences a happy ending, but he doesn't seem to be very convinced with himself. And that's why he made a decision politically right.<br />John Ford was the western's director per excellence. The  film has unforgettable moments, the use of the objective, the travellings and the fantastic landscape in Texas support this jewel. If not for The wild bunch this film would be the greatest western movie, but a second place is not a trageddy.<br />In addition you can find in Ethan a close affinity with the beliefs of Pike in the wild bunch. Doesn't it tell you anything?<br />You must have this DVD in your collection. It's a must. Believe me.
B00008K9Z5|5.0|meteora is another great album from hopefully future legends in the music business.It is so hard to do what lp did,they're debut album was the best selling album of 2001.It is so hard to back up an album like HT,but they did it.Songs like  &quot;from the inside&quot; and &quot;breaking the habit&quot; are just so intense. But the one song that got me is &quot;easier to run&quot;....WOW,what an awesome song, so much heart into that song and all of the songs.I know chester bennington is'nt the coolest rock name ever,but in &quot;faint&quot; he does'nt sound like a guy named chester.i believe that chester is a bit more intense in this one, emotionally, not screaming-wise.Stop hating lp.
B00004RF9I|5.0|The script doesn' t  get old. That is a good signal. Because all you can experience im this movie is far from being untrue. The echoes of that fabulous work of Aldous Huxley \\"A new visit to a brave new world\\", comes to my mind.<br /><br />The conceptual density of the deep implications about the subliminal messages, the huge power of seduction that the mass media impact on our daily behavior, are underlined with clear maestry by the prodigal son of the camera. Mr. Lumet, a film maker that accostumed us to face with real consequences derivated from the excess of power. (Serpico, the Prince of New York, The offence, the Anderson tapes)<br /><br />Remember his previous filmography. The hill is an example of men placed in a borderline. Lumet is a thinker director, extremely exigent and careful in every take he does.<br /><br />His career reached the peak with this monumental movie. And I still wonder, twenty eight years after why the Academy prized Rocky instead of Network. I couldn?t believe it.<br /><br />In these difficult years, it prevailed the feeling of elusive behavior with the cruel reality of these days.<br /><br />And pitifully, Network fell under this category.<br /><br />But the time will be the best judge, and I?m sure Network will grow by itself, due to its inner power.<br /><br />Maybe this fact justifies brightly other unexpalined facts  like not to give the Nobel Prize to Jorge Luis Borges, by example.<br /><br />Anyway don' t forget that Balzac' s statement: \\"The glory is the sun of the dead\\"
6302763835|5.0|Many people categorize 1955's sci-fi film &quot;Tarantula&quot; as a &quot;B&quot; picture or a &quot;cult&quot; flick for just sci-fi buffs. While this may be true to some degree I suppose, I believe this little chiller rises above the average &quot;B&quot; movie, and reaches a loftier status.<br />It's a very re-watchable film, with some pretty good acting and well-drawn characters. Plus a plot that's not totally off-the-wall. Well, yeah, it's out in left field (somewhat), but not so much as to be considered completely ludicrous in every sense.<br />Leo G. Carroll does a fine job as the bio-chemist whose experiments with a new &quot;growth formula&quot; on animals (including our menacing friend, Mister &quot;Tarantula&quot;) go terribly wrong when the multi-legged beast escapes Carroll's laboratory.<br />I truly enjoy watching this movie -- no matter how many screenings I give it.  The atmosphere, characters, and storyline have me &quot;locked in&quot; from the very start.<br />And the special effects don't look too bad either -- considering it's from 1955 and well before &quot;CGI&quot; type beasts &amp; explosions.<br />I even kind of like the rather corny (and, I assume, not realistic) &quot;hissing&quot;/&quot;rattling&quot; noises that emanate from the super-sized spider during the film. LOL!<br />Also on the humorous side of things -- I've always thought it was mighty cooperative of our giant-sized, venom-spewing beast to &quot;follow the road into town&quot; at the end of the film, thereby making the townspeople's job of setting up the dynamite a great deal easier. (Since when do spiders follow the 'rules of the road'? Oh, well, I guess we'll just assume that our Tarantula here owns a '55 Chevy, and is familiar with the desert highways that surround him. LOL!)<br />This whole movie is great fun from start to finish.  Plus -- There's a fun &quot;Theatrical Trailer&quot; for the film included on this VHS version.<br />If you like really big hairy spiders, then look no further than 1955's &quot;Tarantula&quot;.en look no further than 1955's &quot;Tarantula&quot;.
B00008BXJ6|5.0|Have always loved this CD. Can't play it enough, and can't seem to hear it enough. It just sticks to you, as I'm sure many out there would agree. Have been reading Highway To Hell (bio about Bon), and this CD really captures a lot of what Bon was feeling while he was struggling to make it big. He was the old man of the group who had been around for a while before striking gold as the lead singer of AC/DC. The song She's Got Balls was written by Bon after his wife requested a song by him in her honor (she divorced him shortly thereafter). She's Got The Jack was written out of respect for all of AC/DC's loyal groupies. Besides being a great CD, there's also a lot in the lyrics. The book is also pretty good, and will give you more insight into the making of this AC/DC classic album/CD.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|THAT's the combination of Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth - POWERHOUSE ladies with lungs of steel!<br /><br />The Musical is vaguely fruatrating ~ you DO need to listen to it a few times [if you haven't seen the show] to 'get a grip' on it all, but once you've Ozzified yourself, you're in for quite a spell.<br /><br />Lyrics?  Quite brittle and deliciously effective, and ISN'T it about time that we were treated to the Witche's side of the 'Dorothy Saga'?  [Interfering little biddy!]<br /><br />Can't wait for the movie version - intact with the two ladies!<br /><br />Faves?  'Popular' & 'What is This Feeling?&#34; [a shoo-in, superb, superb comedic from Ms. Chenoweth - great babe!], &#34;Defying Gravity&#34; & &#34;The Wizard and I&#34; [Powerhouse stuff from Ms. Menzel .... err Barbra who?].<br /><br />I'm sure that Merman, Miss Ethel that is, would heartily applaud .... now IF only Elaine Stritch would cameo in this one ..........<br /><br />ps. NORBERT LEO BUTZ is another stellar talent worth watching!<br /><br />11-16-2004.<br /><br />FINALLY CAUGHT THE SHOW at the Gershwin!<br /><br />Idina Menzel -  pitch perfect, not a false step - just a brilliant performance, but that goes without saying - this LADY is a STAR&#62;<br /><br />The show has not faltered or sagged . perfect cast [some of the originals have left] - keep going!
B00005JMEW|5.0|Quentin Taratino is the master at creating such wonderful dialogue that you just listen and gawk.  He is amazing at creating such a terrific story and teasing you by not letting the plot out right at the begining such as his other movies (I.E. Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs).  This type of movie genre has not been done before and he adds his flavor to it. One last thing Tarantino knows that music in a movie makes it even more enjoyable and every scene had the perfect song (I.E. Bang Bang he shot me down-Nancy Sinatra).  5 stars all the way.
B0002234LS|5.0|\\"The only problem with Stephen King Films, is that the best ones have been taken\\" - I've read this on so many reviews by Critics about this Film and I don't think thats a fair point. I think there are plenty of Stephen King pieces left and this is one of them. It might not be as long or in depth as something else from his works, but its still Stephen King and its still in that style.<br /> The quirkyness, the crazyness, the insanity and the morbid humour makes this role made for Johnny Depp. Not many Actors could do it convincingly.<br />The story itself?<br />Great, I completely liked it. I think many people didn't appreciate it because they've not read a Stephen King book and they don't realise that is how he writes. You might not always have answers, it might not make sense but thats the way it should be. Thats what makes King such a fabulous Author. Its messed up but it delivers, and I think this Film does the same. <br />I think it deserves every star I've given it.
B000001GBJ|5.0|I was given this CD as gift and I shall be eternally grateful.<br />Never have I been so spellbound with music before as I was upon hearing the beautiful music and voice that burst forth from my player.<br /> Each song filled my home with peace and unseen beauty, almost as if each note played had a life of its own. Mysterious, yet peaceful I sat and let this wonderous music sooth my soul.<br />Highly recommended.
B000002ADT|5.0|As Picasso's &quot;Guernica&quot; is to art, and Dante's &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot; is to literature, so is Miles &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; to jazz.  Let's just face the facts: it is the height of musical perfection, the pinnacle of improvisational genius  --played at a time when giants wallked among us -- and, as many others have said, the ultimate standard in improvisational music.  Loved by countless rockers as well as jazz musicians, it doesn't get much better than this historical milestone.  It  has exiliarated the senses, soothed the soul and sweetened the lives of millions  for over 40 years. Can any real music listener be without it?
B00007GZR5|3.0|This is a story about death. Chris and Anne meet and get children. The children die in a car crash, and their mom never forgives herself for not bringing them to school themselves. Chris (played by Robin Williams) dies himself in a freak accident when he wants to help someone. She herself kills herself later.<br />Chris ends up in heaven, which looks like the paintings his wife makes. Their he meets a sort of guardian angel played by Cuba Gooding. But he is still not happy, he loves his wife and wants her back but unfortunately: suicides go to hell. But through undying love he gets her back to heaven.<br />The colors and the settings are beautiful, the artwork is amazing and therefore alone worth watching. The ending is however a little too cheasy. The DVD has a different and sadder ending, it would have made the movie better but Hollywood probably thought it a bad idea.<br />If you like dreamy movies about what is and what is not real: this movie is for you.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|Master and Commander, the latest Russell Crowe feature, is a story confined to one boat (and a couple of island shots).  You don't even see the enemy...and that's the beauty of the movie.  Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany are such great actors and they can carry a film like this, with no sign of the enemy.  After seeing this movie, I find it amazing that sea battles actually had any survivors.  The action is intense and the sound is simply amazing.  The DVD has both a DTS and Dolby 5.1 tracks, and they are some of the best sound mixes out there.  I highly recommend this DVD.
0790737345|4.0|Why is it that movies about angels and heaven and death intrigue us? Is it because it is something untangible? something we all believe in but are not sure what it actually looks like?<br />City of Angels is a remake of the German movie &quot;Der Himmel über Berlin&quot; (The heaven over Berlin). That movie starts with the angel sitting on a broken church (Gedächtniskirche) in Berlin. Nicolas Cage sits on a skyscraper, America's cathedral.<br />He tries to get alive so he can feel and love. He is helped by another fallen angel played by a magnificent Dennis Frantz. He gets his wish, gets the girl but then...<br />Meg Ryan is superb as ever.
B0000DBJDM|5.0|Enjoyable? Yes. Visualy attractive? Yes. A great Pink Floyd Movie? Definately. <br />This is one of the best live performances I own. (I have 2 Led Zeppelins and a Jimi Hendrix.) The visual effects of david Gilmour and roger Waters playing in front of the guitar is awsome, so is the fire in front of Waters singing. The pictures of the statues between shots are an extra treat. I only wish that the directers cut was better, but the lack of headings before songs is better, and the swimming letters are cool. The extra footage is good, and them making DSOTM is great. The others ods and ends like Pompeii map and history are just filler but makes for good entertainment. <br />Very enjoyable DVD and I recamend it to any PF fan.
B0001ADAVK|5.0|First I just want to say that I am disgusted with some of the reviews on here. Malebashing? Like the stories of betrayal and affair in this film aren't true?! Please! Back in the 1950s, women were expected to get married, raise a family &amp; never be themselves. They were all raised to live the lives they were born to live. The cast in Mona Lisa Smile did a superb job. I found all their performances to be flawless. I really enjoyed the stories being told here &amp; the message that this movie gives. I think anyone especially in today's times can take the advice given in this movie. Don't do what other people expect you to do, because then you'll just be lying to yourself. Live your life, be who you are. Do what you want to do with your life. Now I won't summarize the plot of the movie as it's already written on Amazon, I will just say that the movie was consistent and enjoyable throughout its entirety. It really makes you think. When Mona Lisa smiled, was she actually happy? To quote Kirsten Dunst in the film, &quot;Not everything is as it seems.&quot; Rent this movie or buy it...you'll enjoy it. It's a great story, fun to watch &amp; is even motivational.

B000089RVX|1.0|I don't understand why people would call this band &quot;a rock band&quot;, in fact they sound like a Pop band with some rapping, if you're looking for real rock/metal music , don't even think of buying this CD, you'll get totally sick!
0790729377|5.0|Try as they may, few movies released in recent years have been able to duplicate the feminine sensuality of the scene in which Stella walks down the staircase to meet Stanley.  This is one of the greatest films of all time.
B00007ELJX|2.0|ill just start out by telling you that i felt very dissapointed with this movie. i had high expectations due to the star cameos, which i must admit that i deeply respect all of them, and a top rate sound track. It just didnt stand up to the hype... at all. It just looked like a B movie the whole way through. The beginning was so boring and drawn out that i could bairly tolerate it. i was VERY tempted to stop the video and return in without rewinding it due to the fact that it was so boring... and i havnt stopped watching a rented movie in years. this one was very close. some of the acting was pretty poor too... like, unfortunatly, ole hank rollins... ive seen him do much better than what he did in lost highway. the only reason i have this film more than one star is the fact that the director did do a good job, dispite the poor quality of the film istelf. as for the story line, i didnt like it at all. i like strange movies, but i just didnt care for this script at all. it did pick up towards the end a bit and i did like the pastey camera character, so that did help get the second star. My main beef with the movie was the lack of backround sounds and music. the film wasnt all that bad during the times when there was some sort of music in the backround. <BR>art? who am i to say. all i am saying is that i didnt really care for this movie and would never suggest it to anyone i know, and they would trust me because they trust my film reviews for the most part. i may not know art, but i know what i like.. and i just didnt care for this. it just, how do you say.. SUCKED! i SAID IT! SO THERE!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I don't watch television. In the past, friends have sent me DVDs or  tapes of their favorite, ultimate, best, whoo-hoo series -- and my reaction has been &quot;Ho hum,&quot; or &quot;That was nice.&quot; But when a friend shoved the Firefly DVD set into my hands and demanded that I watch it ... well, she'll never get THAT DVD set back! (Don't worry; I had Amazon.com send her a replacement.) Firefly is superb. Other reviewers have said it all. The cast is perfect. The writing is witty, sharp, and filled with surprises. The sets and locations are  evocative. So all I have to add is two things. 1. Even if TV usually bores you, try Firefly; you won't regret it. (In fact, buy Firefly &amp; support the effort to bring the series back.) 2. The Fox network executives who so badly mishandled the scheduling and presentation of this show should be coated with honey and laid out beside a nest of red ants. Or maybe not. Let's just have some Firefly movies, bring the series back on some other network, and let those Fox execs live with the consequences of their folly as Firefly becomes the next Star Trek (but vastly better than Star Trek ever dreamed of being).
B00005JLWN|5.0|I was originally attracted to this film because of its star, Christian Bale, but I was immediately taken in by the story and amazing action sequences.  Taye Diggs is mesmerizing and chilling.  I would recommend this film over Matix in a heartbeat.  I agree with other reviews, this is sure to be a cult classic.
0441172717|3.0|This sci-fi classic tells the story of the planet Arrakis (otherwise known as Dune). It is a barren place, mainly desert, and water is scarce. But in the sand is a precious spice that controls inter-planetary travel, and everyone wants control. The plot concerns two nobel families, the Atreides and Harkonnens, who fight it out for rulership of the planet. But there is a third, unpredictable force in the form of the native Fremen, who have a plan for Dune all of their own.<br />The story starts quickly, with relationships and loyalties tested as the main characters take sides. There is intrigue, fighting and double-crossing. But after the initial momentum, the plot slows to a crawl. After a narrow escape from death, the main character is exiled, hiding from those out to kill him. He shelters in the desert with the natives, transforming himself into a mystical demi-god to get them on side for the ultimate battle of revenge. There is more talk than action, and the characters spend a lot of time explaining and analysing the planet Dune, and how it determines their own culture and religion. It goes on like this for the next 350 pages.<br />When the final battle comes, Frank Herbert dodges the responsiblity of actually describing it. The preparation is outlined, but then the action cuts off the very moment the forces rush into enemy headquarters. The very next scene is the surrender, the terms and conditions of which are described in exhaustive detail. At this point, &quot;Dune&quot; abruptly ends in a massive anti-climax.<br />Dune is a classic, and as such, should probably be read by any sci-fi fan. However, the book never reaches it's full potential. The themes and plot laid out at the beginning are promising, but they quickly drift into nothingness. By the time you reach the end, you may find that you hardly care about what happens to Dune.
B00004ZAV3|3.0|How can people criticize this CD?   Unlike any other Beatle album, it actually has 14 good songs on it! One of the better Beatle CDs!  3-stars!
B0001KZM4I|4.0|I didn't think it possible for a re-release of an album that the bonus cd of previously unreleased material would be better than the original material. A heck of an album and it does not sound dated. What do the waterboys sound like, difficult to say, but when I am listening to the cd I feel and hear U2 or Springsteen on many of the tracks.Listened to both cds three times in a row as I was that intrigued.
B000002UB3|2.0|This album is OK, but is also a reminder that 1963's cohesive band had by 1969 become a collection of individuals who wrote their own songs and got together to back each other up in the recording studio. The album tracks fall into four separate and identifiable categories - the incredible work by George who saves the album with 2 tracks, John's songs, Paul's songs, and the unfinished songs that were simply spliced together.  Not one of my favorite albums, but worth it because of &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot;.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Kill Bill is a hilarious, but action packed movie. This movie will keep you on your toes from start to finish. Uma Thurman plays a woman out to seek revenge on those who tried to kill her. In order to kill Bill, she has to kill those who are connected to him. In doing so, this movie supplies action and great suspense. You will find yourself laughing hysterically, and gasping all at the same time.  Although some of the scenes seem to be unbelieveable, keep in mind that it is to be taken lightly.If you want to spend your hard earned money on a DVD, then choose Kill Bill Volume 1. This movie is truly one that will not disappoint.
B00006AW2G|2.0|1. Gimme Shelter<BR>2. Midnight Rambler<BR>3. You Can't Always Get What You Want<br />These songs are great, but they are available on the multitude of greatest hits collections out there.  The rest of the album is forgettable.  2-stars.  Sorry.
6305508550|5.0|Office space is a hilarious movie portraying the struggles of the working class. This movie staring Ron Livingston and Jennifer Aniston will leave you in tears. It is a real stress reliever. It will have you laughing right along with them as they struggle through the work week, and even the &quot;case of the Mondays&quot;. Don't let this movie pass you by. Whenever you are feeling bit by the working class bug, this movie will make it seem all worthwhile. You'll feel as if you have experienced the same or similiar experiences at your own job. However, this movie will make you feel a whole lot better about those experiences. This is truly a great movie to watch over and over. You'll find different situations funny with every showing.
0156012197|2.0|ok another book book we had to read (and rewirte) in english.  Basically the story is about a pilet who gets stranded in the desert and meets the little prince.  TLP then tells him his life story starting on his own planet and then going on his trip to earth.  Durring the book there are several refferences to drugs and stuff like that.  It scares me that four year olds like this book.  They are basiclly reading a book on how drugs are good.
B0001Z53AQ|5.0|I'm having a difficult time trying to figure out why people are hating this album.  It's not another Devil's Night, and D-12 wasn't trying to make a carbon copy of Devil's Night.  What you have is the growth of a group from one album to the next.  My guess is that people aren't taking time to actually listen to the album to give it its due credit (if this is the case track #13 characterizes this point....that being that you aren't paying attention to the words, just the beats).  Even if that is the case, the production of this album is on point, so why the complaints?  I appreciate the fact that each member brings his own style to the mix.  Both Kon Artis and Kuniva bring a &quot;Red &amp; Meth&quot; type of back-and-forth delivery on a couple tracks (#2 &amp; #13) which has their own unique flavor.  I'm not sure what the plans are for the group members own individual album plans, but I would love to see Mr. Porter and Rondell Beene collaborate on an album project together.<br />The best part of what D-12 brings is a different vibe than other group albums.  If you appreciatated Devil's Night, appreciate Eminem's albums, and appreciate what is coming out of the Shady/Aftermath Camp in general, this album does not disappoint.<br />Favorite Tracks:  Press the play button.
B00008DDXC|3.0|This was a relaitvly good movie with many flaws.  There are many technical flaws, like different shots have differnet things.  But the biggest goof is Daniel Radcliff.  He cannot act.  Neither can Emma Watson.  In the book I liked Hermione,  but in the movie she is a annoying brat.  They both are the only thing i dont like about the movie.  Ron on the other hand rocks.  he is so funny with his witty lines like \\"bloody hell\\" something that we never say in the USA.  Now that the awsome actor who played Dumbledor os gone, i am worried about the movies.  NO ONE can fill his shoes, btu i geuss we will have to see.  I am looking forward to when they have to re cast the three main role because the actors look to old.
B000148KK2|2.0|There have certainly been some whacked reviews on Amazon.com before, but some of the reviews below for Diana's new record are probably some of the worst.  You got your jazz police saying that Elvis Costello has no talent (are you nuts?) you've got your standards buffs not even recognizing that a standard is POP song (yes, there have songs been songs written in the last 40 years that qualify as standards), and then you have your average Diana-hater who pines for the days of singers like Billie Holiday, Carmen McRae and Ella Fitzgerald (you know, you don't have to listen to Diana if you don't want to).  I love them too, but they ain't recording anymore, sorry.  <br />Separating those folks away from the actual subject, the music on the CD, should help you make your decision to purchase this disc or not.  Listen to the sound clips.<br />Personally, I like this disc.  There were definitive versions recorded already of many of the songs that \\"made\\" Diana and she needed to move on or stagnate.  To me, she has incredible interpretative skills and deals with these new standards quite well.   Not only that, she started writing her own material, and a few tunes are quite good - Narrow Daylight in particular.  That's a beauty.<br />(...) Talking about a historical reversal... Again, just listen to the sound clips and make up your own mind. I think you'll hear a record you want to buy. I'm out.
B00005A3KS|5.0|I first came accross this movie a few years ago on T.V. and even the bastardizing T.V. will usually do to a movie, I still enjoyed the bit of it I saw.  This is also true for the movie &quot;Lock Up.&quot;  Anyways, I decieded to rent the movie, and was suprised by how good it was.  Most movie &quot;critics&quot; shun Keanu Reeves's acting, and in a way, I kind of see why they see it that way, but at the same time I think they need not compare it to shakespere either.  Most &quot;critics&quot; have it in for Keanu I think because of Bill and Ted.  Which if you get past the obvious flaws, and enjoy the movie for what it is, you don't notice any of the so-called bad acting.  Obviously, they are the only one's that think so, because the only votes that matter are the votes in the form of ticket sales, and quite frankly Keanu is on the upper escelon of this right along with Schwarzenegger,Stallone,Willis, and Travolta.  And like Bill and Ted, if you just take the movie for what it is,it is a great movie.  You really don't even have to try hard as Reeves once again makes a memorable character, and with Patrick Swayze in one of his best roles non-&quot;chick-flick&quot; that I have seen him in. Swayze is a very &quot;real&quot; and textured character as Bodhi.  Basically the story is about Keanu Reaves's character Johnny Utah, who is a FBI agent getting his first assignment to track down the notorious Bank robbers, &quot;The Ex-Presidents&quot; who rob banks every summer-time and have never been caught.  Along with Utah Gary Busey is Angelo,Utah's veteren FBI partner who is very big on doing things the &quot;Old School&quot; way.  Together Angelo and Utah discover that the Ex-Presidents are probably surfers and figure out what &quot;break&quot; they surf by getting samples and doing anylasis.  <BR>Utah poses as a fellow surfer and meets what will be his love interest in the movie.  Lori Petty plays Utah's love interest Tyler and initially teaches him how to surf, and alsogives info on the othe surfers in which his attention is directed for the first time to Bodhi.  Once Utah kind of gets the hang of surfing He and Angelo try to seek out who they think are the Ex-Presidents.  They come accross this gang of Surfers led by Red Hot Chili Pepper,Anthony Kiedus, who have criminal records and when confronted by these surfers, Bodhi steps in and Helps Utah.  Bodi then realizes that he is Johhny Utah QB from Ohio State.  He then asks Utah to play some football with he and his fellow surfers.  Once Bodhi sees Utah's exreme side while playing football, he kind of lets Utah into his gang.  Bodhi tells Utah about the spiritual side to surfing and Utah gets taken in by this and later this would affect his ability to catch Bodhi chasing him after a bank robbery.  Once Bodhi realizes that Utah is an FBI agent, he intends to get even by forcing him to be apart of a bank heist.  However the heist goes horribly wrong when Bodhi breaks his own rule and stays in the bank too long causing his little brother's death.  Eventually Angelo and Utah track down Bodhi on an Airstrip trying to flee the country and this is when Angelo gets shot and killed.  Bodhi gets away but not for long as Utah remembers that Bodhi would be going to Australia to catch some in human Monster wave.  As Utah apprehends Bodhi, Bodhi asks Utah for only one thing, to let him ride one last time.  Utah agrees and Bodhi rides and fades into the wave dying in the process.  By the end you learn some things and these messages really make you think.  Who is really right, Did Bodhi have a point?  I thought about the meaning long after the movie was over and soon bought the DVD and watched it many times since.  If you have ever surfed, skidived or just think that your 9-5 job sucks and would like a movie either to relate to or give you soming to think about, this movie does that.  Really give it a chance and think about what the meanings are and I'll bet you will like this movie as much as Ihave.
B00005JM0B|4.0|I thought this film was going to be very confusing for me because I have never seen the first two films. But it was very easy to understand and I thoroughly enjoy the action and the comedy. Right at the start you see John Connor remind us of what has previously gone on, and from there it's action all the way. Although I don't get why everyone was saying that Arnie should've retired all those years ago. Sure, Collateral Damage was the biggest load of tosh ever or something like that, but twelve years since Judgement Day, James Cameron might not be back, but he sure is-with a vengeance!
B0001L3MI0|4.0|People are taking movies too seriously; no movie is real or realistic; for example Kung Fu movies, they are fun to watch but far from reality. I enjoy the movie Independence Day and sure it had its faults on the realism part, but that is the point IT IS NOT REAL. The movie was fun and entertaining; the whole point of movies. A good movie has the ability to draw the person into the action just like a good book. I have to admit there were some parts of the movie I did not like but that goes with the territory. We should remember we all have different taste when it comes to movies. However when I recommend a movie or book I always tell a person this is my personal opinion and you may or may not like the movie.
0743455967|5.0|I love Steven King's stories, but even if you don't (in this case my advise is to skip the first 100 or so pages) this book will inspire you. This book gives you the NO NONSENSE way to write fiction: make anything up (it basicly tells you) and then later (at least 6 weeks) read it and edit it. Not so hard is it? If your looking for plot, grammar, theme or style advice this is not it and you should try the &quot;Elements of Fiction Writing Series&quot;. Good luck!
B00008O89K|5.0|I agree completely with the previous reviewer, get the Varese recording of this soundtrack, which has 16 tracks in all from the movie, more than on this version. <br />This is my favorite soundtrack of all, I think it is a clear and undisputable masterpiece. The mood and melody in these tracks is something so spiritual and profound, I can't put it into words because I don't fully understand it, it's beyond my comprehension. Poledouris was touched by the finger of God when he composed this score. This soundtrack never gets old for me. I come back to it from time to time to hear by favorite tunes from it, and always I'm shaken and moved like from a deep inner religious experience. This is a rare phenomenon and proves that this is very special music indeed. <br />David Rehak<BR>author of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;
B0001CNRS4|5.0|I just wanted to respond to The Viewer from Seattle, Wash. who showed they're ignorance in they're review of &quot;Honey&quot;. Let me inform you that Latino/Hispanic is not a race ,anyone can be Latino/Hispanic whether you're black, white, brown or yellow <BR> as long as you or your family comes from a Latin country. Have you ever seen Sammy Sosa or Celia Cruz before they are both Black or part Black but they are also Latinos in terms of their culture, so do me a favor and open your mind and not your mouth because you don't know what you are talking about. Being &quot;Black&quot; doesn't equate to being born in the U.S. Jessica Alba is playing a young woman of african and european descent but her nationality and culture is american. My point is that being a latina has no bearing on one's race because being a latino/Latina is about being apart of the same culture not being the same skin color.
B000002AT6|4.0|There are some really memorable, evocative tunes and exciting tracks on this soundtrack, like &quot;Samuel's Death&quot; for instance. At times brooding and often lush, these sweeping melodies are symbolic of the Old West. <br />David Rehak<BR>author of &quot;Love and Madness&quot;
0684803356|5.0|When I read this book, I was astonished. How could a book be so amazing, so perfect? How could such a collection of words come from the mind of a man? This is the first Hemingway I have read and it will be the last so as not to risk tainting my impression of his genius with what must be relatively inferior works. Though I'm sure his other novels are great, I simply can't imagine them being on par with this absolute masterpiece.
B00001MXXH|5.0|While an older movie filmed in the mid 80's, Ferris Beuller's Day Off is still a classic and a favorite by many to this day. Featuring stars like Mattew Broderick, Alan Ruck and Jennifer Grey, the storyline is one that any teen can relate to. Skipping school, being cool and living a leisurely life are the motto's of this dream come true movie for any high school student. By far one of Matthew Broderick's best movies, not only does this movie that show class skipping highschoolers how it's done, the music is great too. Be sure to check out the movie and its soundtrack. Five very big stars for this classic film.
0140042520|5.0|DHARMA BUMS came out a year after ON THE ROAD.  While the latter is the beat manifesto celebrating the peripatetic lifestyle, BUMS focuses on the beat romance with Buddhist enlightenment and the building of an inner life.  ON THE ROAD was an instant, memorable success, and while BUMS no doubt fed a desire for more of the same, it stands apart, its own satisfying work of art, its own way of sending telegraphs from the heart of the beat movement. Many of the episodes are based on actual events and experiences that were still fresh memories as the book was written.<br />Ray Smith is the first person narrator of DHARMA BUMS, a look alike for Jack Kerouac.  For most of the book, he slyly puts Japhy Ryder at the center of attention.  Ryder is a stand-in for poet Gary Snyder who survives, who as a young man in his twenties was already a natural leader. Surrounding them are other familiar figures from the era, including Alvah Goldbook (translates to Allen Ginsberg).  They all write poetry and love jazz, women, and a casual lifestyle. They seek spiritual enlightenment.  They delight in trolling for clothes in the Good Will and Army and Navy stores, they savor the simplest meal over a campfire.  They are the Dharma Bums, rejecting the paralyzed emptiness they ascribe to middle class life.<br />I really like this book.  The prose is clear and concrete, even when sorting through abstract notions.  It is often funny.  Kerouac had extraordinary insight into individual nuances and desires, and plays them into the tension of the journey and the sorting out.  He had a gift for seeing how outsiders might perceive him and his crowd and how history might come to interpret the present he was portraying.  Though he is legendarily perceived as a spontaneous artist, there is extraordinary control and shape imposed on these pages. Only twice does he momentarily break his world: once, in my edition, he slips and refers to Japhy as Gary, and another time, slipping out of the immediacy of theaction, he pays a compliment to a simple meal on the road, noting that even as a lionized young writer in New York, he had not had a better meal in an upscale restaurant.  Those curious nanoseconds can be forgiven, however.  This book is a joy.
B00005J6UP|5.0|The Goonies is a classic movie for kids and families alike. An earlier work by Steven Spielberg, The Goonies is an adventure/comedy film that follows the dreams of any child. Following a map that leads to a hidden pirate treasure and trying to survive the traps laid along the way take a group of kids on a fantastic but dangerous journey. The kids called \\"the Goonies\\" not only narrowly escape dangerous traps set by the infamous pirate One Eyed Willie; they also learn many new things about themselves. A favorite you will always enjoy and never forget.

B000060MMI|4.0|I snagged &quot;Drunken Lullabies&quot; on some good word-of-mouth, and I was amazed.  Many bands brag that they are an Irish punk act, but they can't pull it off.  If there is a dictionary of musical styles, under &quot;Irish Punk&quot; it should read, &quot;See Flogging Molly.&quot;  <br />The title track, &quot;What's Left of the Flag,&quot; and &quot;The Kilburn High Road,&quot; are thrashing, crazed guitar rants perfect for a rugby team's pre-game locker room scene.  If anything, &quot;FM&quot; gets a bit carried away during their tunes -- &quot;Death Valley Queen,&quot; &quot;Rebels of the Sacred Heart,&quot; and &quot;Another Bag of Bricks&quot; made me check the liner notes to see if the band has a cardiologist or ER doc to thank!  &quot;The Rare Old Times&quot; and &quot;The Sun Never Shines (on Closed Doors)&quot; prove that &quot;FM&quot; is not a one-trick pony, but you wish that there was a little more such diversity on the album.  <br />Check these guys out -- if we're lucky, they'll be around for a long time.

0671027387|3.0|Full disclosure -- I read &quot;Deception Point&quot; after reading Brown's hugely successful other novels, &quot;Angels and Demons&quot; and &quot;The Da Vinci Code.&quot;  &quot;DP&quot; doesn't measure up to either of those books, but that is unfair criticism considering their rampant success.<br />&quot;DP&quot; is a fairly routine thriller that will serve you well on an airplane.  Brown has apparently always known how to write a page-turner -- &quot;DP&quot; drives you forward as efficiently and relentlessly as &quot;Angels&quot; or &quot;Code.&quot;  The relative weakness of the book is the plot, which just seems kind of silly in comparison to Brown's later offerings.<br />&quot;DP&quot; uses some Brown staples -- attractive, hyper-educated, likable characters get involved in revealing secrets that others will kill to protect.  Here, the secret involves the potential discovery of proof of alien life in a meteorite found under centuries of ice.  Brown knows how to write the action scenes well, and he does a great job of explaining the science underlying the discovery (as well as the critical verification of the discovery), which in the hands of a lesser author could have been as dull as a bad &quot;Discovery Channel&quot; program.<br />That being said, the whole enterprise is rather pedestrian . . . again, considering Brown's later triumphs.  &quot;DP&quot; is fairly predictable due to the law of economy of characters (i.e., since there are only a few important characters in a book, there can only be so many who could be responsible for any given action).  &quot;DP&quot; uses one of Brown's favorite devices -- the anonymous commander, who goes by a title rather than a name until the grand reveal later in the story -- to control the sinister Delta Force team who tracks and attacks our heroes.  &quot;Angels&quot; and &quot;Code&quot; also use the anonymous commander, but to greater effect.<br />The discovery of alien intelligence just does not rise to the level of the mysteries Brown covers in &quot;Angels&quot; and &quot;Code.&quot;  These later books have inspired me to visit the Vatican and Paris to see the religious symbols Brown writes about so effectively.  &quot;DP&quot; left me thinking, &quot;Hmm, meteorite . . . m'kay.&quot;<br />As a result, we don't care as much for our heroes in &quot;DP&quot; as we do for Robert Langdon and comrades from the later novels.  That doesn't mean that we're not gripped by Brown's description of being whisked over the Artctic shelf by parachutes in gale-force winds, or a dastardly deed committed by a Delta Force soldier and a fly-sized recon robot, or a gun battle on board a ship.  But the thrills are temporary, and I doubt that I'll feel any need to re-read this book ever again.<br />For the general reader, a 3-star review -- fun, but no great loss if you miss it.  For the reader who is desperately looking for a distraction from the tedium of the four-hour flight from Portland to Houston, it's a 5-star read!f the mysteries Brown covers in &quot;Angels&quot; and &quot;Code.&quot;  These later books have inspired me to visit the Vatican and Paris to see the religious symbols Brown writes about so effectively.  &quot;DP&quot; left me thinking, &quot;Hmm, meteorite . . . m'kay.&quot;  <br />As a result, we don't care as much for our heroes in &quot;DP&quot; as we do for Robert Langdon and comrades from the later novels.

B0001CCXY8|4.0|The music on this album is probably the most complex since &quot;The Bleeding&quot;.  Unfortunately Corpsegrinder's vocals are once again monotonous.  He doesn't mix it up enough, it's more of a fast rap than a catchy &quot;You think you know... who I am... all I know is I love to Kill...&quot;  He doesn't change pace much, doesn't throw anything out there to pull you in.  No where near as clever as the music.  Definitely worth buying though...
0679720200|3.0|This book could be considered a bronze standard existentialist novel. You're unlikely to look at life quite the same way after reading it.
B0001EBXBK|5.0|I guess, from reading through several pages of user reviews, that this is one of those films you either adore or hate. I'm not too comfortable myself with this whole releasing of 'special editions' and 'ultimate 2-disc editions' we've been getting these days from various houses and this is probably no exception. However, this annoying trend doesn't diminish the movie in the least. If you're buying DVDs for extras, then perhaps you ought to be waiting for the 'bloody amazing mega-turbo ultimate gold 14-disc edition' that will undoubtedly come out in a couple months time along with Kill Bill vol.2.<br />The movie itself, though, like I said, is love it or hate it. There's a copious amount of blood and gore, which is treated pretty much like any other design element. The entire movie moves from everyday color, to gritty black and white, to gorgeously garish Tokyo neons at night (oohh, that yellow and black moto outfit)... Everything about the movie screams lush and vivid and lovely. It's not a movie that really takes itself too seriously, it just wants to take you along for the ride. And it -is- an amazing ride.<br />Also, hello lovely soundtrack. I haven't seen a better collection of pieces in ages. The music itself makes this a must-own movie. There are very, very amazing scenes that will play out in your head forever-after when you hear these songs.
6305922756|5.0|\\"This is Spinal Tap\\" is one of the most original, subtle, hilarious movies you will ever see, and offers more great quotes than any film this side of \\"Fletch.\\"  <br />A \\"mockumentary,\\" \\"Tap\\" is pure fiction.  But it's fiction that captures some universal truths about the relentless pursuit of a dream, even while the rest of the world is screaming at you to wake up.  <br />Marty DeBergi (Rob Reiner) is \\"producing\\" this documentary about Spinal Tap, \\"one of Europe's loudest bands.\\"  We see Reiner travel with the band on tour to promote its newest album, \\"Smell the Glove,\\" and he gets to interview the band at great length -- in no small part because most of their gigs appear to be canceled.  <br />The music, written and performed by actors Michael McKean (David St. Hubbins on lead vocals and guitar), Christopher Guest (lead guitar Nigel Tufnel), and Harry Shearer (bassist Derek Smalls) is a hilarous reprise of various genres of rock and roll, heavy on the power-rock of the '70s (\\"Sex Farm,\\" \\"Stonehenge,\\" \\"Big Bottom\\"), with a little psychedelic feel-good rock in there too (\\"Listen to the Flower People\\").  One of the best soundtracks ever, these songs skewer the performers as well as those you who were fans of this kind of music when it was big.<br />The album is released, the tour kicks off, and the wheels begin to fall off.  Many scenes are legendary.  \\"Hello Cleveland!\\" -- when the band can't find the stage.  \\"But these go to eleven\\" -- Nigel explains why his amplifiers have more power than the next guys.  \\"It's okay, Boston's not a big college town\\" -- when the band learns their next gig was canceled.  \\"It's a fine line between stupid and clever\\" -- debating artistic choices made by the band.  \\"Puppet show and Spinal Tap\\" -- the sign announcing the band's next gig.  \\"Spinal Tap, currently residing in our 'Where are they now?' file\\" -- while the band (on tour) listens to the radio play one of their old songs.  And so on and so forth.<br />If you have the good fortuneof knowing a professional musician, ask them about \\"Tap.\\"  Odds are, without saying any more, you're going to see a wide smile and start getting the quotes.  The filmmakers' understanding of (and affection for) life on the road in the music business is eerie.  <br />A comedy essential that must be part of any DVD collection.  The DVD is full of extras, including some hilarious dialogue from the band over the opening menu!
B00006879E|5.0|The first time I heard this band was their song &quot;This Love&quot;.  Before I saw the video, I thought they were a new R&amp;B group.  I was very impressed and I instantly fell in love with the song.  They are a great mixture of R&amp;B, funk and rock. The more I heard the song, the more I loved it.  I decided to buy the CD even though I had only heard 1 song.  The CD is absolutely wonderful from the first song to the last.  I listen to every song on the CD without skipping any.  These guys are amazing! It's good to know there are still musicians out there and musicians who know what REAL MUSIC is all about and appreciate it.  I would love to see them perform live.  I am now a Maroon 5 fan!
0440178002|5.0|\\"Shogun\\" is one of my absolute favorite novels.  James Clavell masterfully weaves a tale of gigantic scope -- the clash of the Orient versus the West, civil war, religious strife, forbidden love, and the rise of Lord Toranaga to the position of Shogun.  To even attempt to tell such a tale is an astounding feat, and yet Clavell tells the story with such intimacy and power that the reader can't help but be swept away.<br />John Blackthorne, English pilot of a Dutch merchant ship, accidentally finds Japan after a storm blows his scurvy-ridden ship ashore.  He awakes to find himself in a beautiful, alien land -- a tall, blonde, blue-eyed European, he could not appear more out of place than among the short, delicate-yet-deadly Japanese.  Language is just one of the many barriers to be crossed.  While Blackthorne is horrified by Japanese brutality -- a samurai viciously beheads a peasant who fails to bow -- Blackthorne is also introduced to the wonders of Japan, such as the simple pleasure of a hot bath.<br />Much of the story revolves around Blackthorne's \\"education,\\" and how he learns to become Japanese.  While Blackthorne is one heck of a capable guy, Clavell wisely shows Blackthorne repeatedly struggling with the transition -- his difficulty learning the language is a nice touch.<br />Along the way, Blackthorne meets and falls in love with the beautiful Mariko, who bears the burden not only of a tormented bull of a husband (the warrior Buntaro), but also the curse of her family caused by a treacherous ancestor.  Blackthorne also meets the wily, sadistic Yabu, who boils one of Blackthorne's crew members alive for his pleasure and is one of the most unreliable allies one could wish for.  <br />Blackthorne also finds himself a major player in Lord Toranaga's undeclared civil war.  Clavell repeatedly throws Blackthorne and Toranaga from danger to peril, and their escapes are alternately achieved by daring, physical prowess, and intelligence.  <br />Further complicating matters are the Jesuits, who already have a strong foothold in Japan and have even converted some of the leading samurai . . . as well as Mariko.  Clavell's handing of the struggle between the militant Japanese spirit and the seemingly contradictory Christian ideals is particularly sensitive.  Like many of us, the Japanese fight to adopt Jesus' teachings into their world, in which the practicalities of life and death (as well as commitment to Japanese traditions) makes Christianity more than a bit burdensome.  Mariko's spirituality is particularly moving. <br />Rich in detail, \\"Shogun\\" spends as much time on a major battle between ninja and samurai as it does a slow tryst between Blackthorne and Mariko as they travel to Osaka.  Buntaro's perfect tea ceremony, an offer of reconciliation with Mariko, is heartbreaking in its sincerity.  Blackthorne, with a great eye for detail, is forever marking the exquisite details of this foreign land, and the reader feels as if he has tramped the hills of Izu, strode the halls of Osaka castle, and sailed the Japanese coast by the time the book is over.<br />Perhaps Clavell's greatest creation is Lord Toranaga, the ultimate puppet master in this epic.  Through Toranaga's humanity as well as his genius, we appreciate why so many are willing to fight and die for him . . . and through him we see the true worth of the other characters.  <br />All in all, a wonderful masterpiece that you won't want to end.
B0000035E7|4.0|DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM IF YOU NEVER HEARD NIRVANA BEFORE, YOU WILL HATE IT.  I would buy &quot;Nevermind&quot; and &quot;Unplugged in New York&quot; if you want to get into Nirvana.<br />Bleach is one of Nirvana's more naked albums, right up their with &quot;Incesticide&quot; and &quot;In Utero&quot;.  I bought it to end my collection of having all of their CD's.  I wanted it first because I wanted to hear &quot;Love Buzz&quot;, but after listening to it I found some truly amazing and creative tracks such as &quot;Blew&quot;, &quot;Negative Creep&quot;, &quot;School&quot;, and of course &quot;About a girl&quot;.  A true Nirvana fan will notice (and I think enjoy) how poorly mixed it was considering it only costed $600 to make the album.  I, for one, like hearing Nirvana at it's raw  and expiremental stage.  You will honestly appreciate this record in the long run.
0802130208|5.0|There simply aren't enough stars in the heavens for this great book.  Laugh out loud funny with a dark underlying and warped underbelly, this rollicking and twisted tale is now a southern classic. The main character of Ignatius has got to be the funniest and most disturbed individual ever to grace the written page. Why this book wasn't made into a movie long ago is beyond me.  Would also recommend another great book, similar to this one in its scope, humor, and insight: Bark of the Dogwood by Jackson McCrae.
0312995423|5.0|I bought this book rather reluctantly, sure that it couldn't stand up to &quot;Angels &amp; Demons&quot; and &quot;The DaVinci Code&quot;.  In less than fifteen minutes, I was hooked.  I will grant that Susan Fletcher is a less likeable central character than Robert Langdon, but it was still a thriller.<br />Even more impressive, my fifteen year old son loved it.  The kid has never read anything except Harry Potter, but he devoured this book in three days.  He would get so excited, he would actually yell out loud at every plot twist (let me tell you, that's alot of yelling).  We had our first book discussion ever that didn't include the word &quot;Hogwarts&quot;.  I would love to thank Dan Brown for that gift.<br />Even though I work on a computer all day, I can't verify whether he got the computer engineering right, but who cares?  It's fiction, for crying out loud!  I don't want to read a stinking manual, I want to be entertained.  And &quot;Digital Fortress&quot; did that very well.

B0001AVZA8|2.0|I love Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton..Without too much explanations, they are simply two of the best actors/actresses of all time.<BR>But watching Something's Gotta Give, I can not but feel sheer disappointment at the result that could have been far better with a tighter script and better director.<BR>First of all the problem with the film is its length, over two hours long..<BR>I never minded long films, (I sat through Bertoluccis's Novencetto more times that I can remember without being aware or bothering too much with its length)..But to sit through two hours of an overstretched story that is drenched in sugary sentimentality was tiring. <BR>Moreover, the problem with the film is too many unnecessary characters. For instance the characters of Frances McDormand and Paul Michael Glazer, although credited as stars, were too shallow, appearing in a couple of scenes at most and added nothing to the plot.<BR>Amanda's Peet character was also very badly written: we see here at first falling for the rich older guy without sleeping with him, inexplicably telling him when they arrived at her mother's house: are you glad we waited?? !!! Then towards the end of the film and in a space of six months,( movie time), we see her the image of domesticity, married and  three months pregnant!!<BR>Keanu Reeves also inexplicably falls head over heels with Keaton's character, and their short romance is probably the lamest and most confusing I have seen in a film. <BR>Now I have to mention few words about the acting of Nicholson and Keaton:<BR>Nancy Meyers manages to get so much over the top acting from them, and fails miserably to get the right performances. <BR>The scenes I cringed in the most are the ones we see them crying, probably intended to add some bittersweet humor, but it became overbearingly annoying.<BR>When Nicholson cried at the very end of About Schmidt, I connected totally with him, and it was genuinely bittersweet because his tears reflected his whole story, his loneliness, frustration and tinge of hope for the future, in short they had deep meaning. In Something's Gotta Give, even for a comedy, it was totally pointless.<BR>Yet I must say that there were few laughs in the first half of the movie, and some promise of a sweet romantic movie, unfortunately lost in the second half, ruining the whole film.<BR>Having said all that, the only aspect of the film which I liked, was how refreshing to see people above sixty, falling in love and having sex..not many films have shown that.<BR>I now must mention, maybe two trivial observations,that did not help this negative review.<BR>The first is the issue of smoking..We see Keaton as an anti smoking healthy woman, but at the end she lights up!! Probably intended to reflect how she has lightened up..but it was a very wrong message to give (and this is coming from a smoker!!) it is time filmmakers take some responsibility in this very sensitive issue.<BR>The other observation revolves around a scene when just before making love, Nicholson asks Keaton about birth control pills, and she naturally answers,no menopause!! Although it is kind of a funny dialog, she should have asked him instead whether he had a condom or not!! him being as it has been over emphasized,a sexually promiscuous man..again this would have been a good message to send at a time when sexual transmitted diseases and especially AIDS are still very much with us, and more so with straight people..<BR>So Something's Gotta Give is a missed opportunity to take advantage of the wealth of talent involved, and a proof that excellent actors are not enough to make a good movie.
1592400876|2.0|This is the &quot;Emperor's Clothes&quot; in action.  Recall that old fable about the Emperor getting new &quot;clothes&quot;, which were actually nothing, but no one dared tell him he was running around in his birthday suit?  This book and its power to aid anyone is made fo the same cloth as those imaginary clothes.  Nudge, nudge, wink, wink...Yanks, they are having one on you.<br />If they really wanted to present a good work that actually helped, they could not take time to edit it for USA usage?<br />Nope, they said, &quot;Hey, the Yanks won't know the difference....&quot;<BR>Shame on the publisher for this farce, shame on Amazon for going along with it.
B0001US8EO|5.0|Despite much harsh criticism this film endured upon its June 1994 theatrical release, it's a pleasure to see WYATT EARP garnering the attenion it has always deserved. Those who voted it a lost cause a decade ago due to disappointing box office results surely did not expect the popularity this film later earned on the home video and cable television markets, thus exposing it to a much broader audience. Originally developed by Kevin Costner and his producing partner Jim Wilson to be a large-scale cable television mini-series for HBO or Showtime, Costner's longtime friend Lawrence Kasdan stepped in and revamped it as a full-scale motion picture epic, compressing the project in mind a little bit for better interpretation on a wider canvas. With vast landscapes, a stellar cast, lush cinematography and produced with a passion not only for the genre, but for old school epic filmmaking, WYATT EARP is a superb film that deserves its still-growing attention and accolades. Unlike the so-so comic book-esque TOMBSTONE, WYATT EARP tells the real story and takes its time doing so. The result is an unforgettable motion picture experience that you will surely watch again and again. I am very happy that Warner Brothers decided to include on the 2-disc set not only a brand new feature-length documentary, but a little gem of a documentary called \\"Wyatt Earp: Walk With A Legend\\" that originally aired on CBS in 1994 the night before the film was released theatrically. I was hoping they would include that featurette so I could retire my aging video copy recorded ten years ago. Superb epic filmmaking still exists, film fans...WYATT EARP proves this in droves!
B000066NW0|1.0|It's unbelievable people would give this pathetic excuse for an album more than 1 star.<br />It's like Hilary Duff, except the singer in question is even more annoying (which surprised me).
0316666343|5.0|I picked this up when it first came out, not having read reviews on it. It immediately sounded good from the dust jacket, so I soon began....<BR>My, this is very touching. How often do you read a book where the main character is in Heaven, telling her version of the events that got her there?<BR>This book engages you from the beginning &amp; does not let go. You feel a variety of emotions throughout. The ending gives the book a nice finish as well.<BR>I simply loved it.
B000094DUP|4.0|Before I comment on the album, I'd like to say that Michael Hunt and JimmyBGoode not only seem to suffer from some pathological resentment of Delta Goodrem, but they also need to seriously get their facts straight. If Mr Hunt cares to even research this topic, he would find that the warning signs Delta experienced were body rash, night sweats and a lump at the base of the throat, NOT a mole. She was diagnosed and treated at St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney.<BR>Delta's career was NOT &quot;down the toilet&quot; when she was diagnosed with Hodgkin's. In fact she was going very strongly, having already had three hit singles in Australia. And just prior to the announcement of her illness, she was about to fly to New York to showcase her music in the USA. HARDLY the signs of someone whose career was going &quot;down the toilet&quot;!<br />She is a trained pianist, and was writing and recording music way before her debut in the Australian TV soap &quot;Neighbours&quot;.  Yes, I agree, &quot;Neighbours&quot; did give her music a big boost in exposure both in Australia and the UK. But that's hardly an unfair tactic, especially considering that the &quot;Neighbours&quot; producers were more than willing to construct a character around her musical talent.<BR>She earnt her respect and musical credibility, and is respected and appreciated by many in the music/recording insdustry. Prior to her illness, she worked VERY hard to promote her music with media and public appearances, without any mention of illness. Looking back, no doubt many would argue that perhaps she worked TOO hard when it came to promotion. <BR>One of her producers on that album, Vince Pizzinga, a classically-trained musician, said of her: &quot;Delta's sophistication musically is so well beyond her years&quot;  {Rolling Stones magazine, 2003 Yearbook }.<br />I agree with JimmyBGoode that there are people far worse off than Delta was, and even Delta has said that herself. She has said she gains inspiration from such people, and has also donated time and money to charity. With her latest magazine interview in Australian Women's Weekly magazine - about her plight with Hodgkin's - Delta donated $200,000 to charity. Is that selfish, is it? Have either of you ever considered that perhaps such an article would offer inspiration and hope to others going through the same kind of experience?<br />I disagree with both of these guys. Delta did not 'use' illness as a ploy to further her own ambitions. For heaven's sake, when you're suffering from a life-threatening illness, AND you're experiencing fatigue, violent bouts of illness and nausea in between sessions of horrible chemotherapy and radiotherapy, then don't you think that the biggest priority on her mind would be to survive and get well? Rather than: &quot;Oh where can I get myself published today?&quot;<br />Give me a break!<br />As for her album, she has a rich, heartfelt, melodious voice, and demonstrates good songwriting ability in the tracks she wrote or co-wrote, especially &quot;Innocent Eyes&quot; and &quot;Will You Fall For Me&quot;. Her lyrics perhaps convey to me someone still awaiting more life experience, nevertheless, she shows much promise. And having a multi-platinum Australian #1 album demonstrates her appeal spanning beyond just teenagers. Definitely a must-listen!
B00009P1MP|5.0|Congratulations are due to Doug Schwartz, who remastered this CD.  The sound is absolutely beautiful and of audiophile quality. This album is a bargain at this price; they should be charging two or three times the asking price.  I own many remastered audiophile LPs and CDs (in many different formats and re-mastering processes) and this is one of the best sounding recordings that I have ever heard. Mr. Schwartz's work rivals that of the legendary Steve Hoffman, Bill Inglot and Bob Ludwig. I am so impressed with the sound quality of 'American Pie' that I  recommend to EMI/ Capitol that they hand over the Beatles' catalogue to Mr. Schwartz to work his magic.
B0001US8FI|5.0|Bruce Lee - jeez, what an icon. I remember traveling in the Soviet Union back in the late 80's and saw memorabilia and souvenirs featuring the 'little dragon.' I think it was then I realized the scope of his appeal. I wish they would tell us what the 'extra features' are that warrant an extra disk.  <br />But the movie itself is a classic. How many people were first exposed to the martial arts through this guy's films? I wonder if any of the Green Hornet stuff is available? I've got all his stuff on video tape, but I guess I'll have to get started on a DVD collection. This will be a great beginning.
B000084T18|3.0|I picked up this album when it first came out and thought it was okay, a little overrated, but I like it.  I have to say that his underground and freestyle stuff is much better.  Most of the songs on this album sound like they were made for the radio, and probably are.  I'm interested in seeing in what direction he goes on his next album, back to the raw underground stuff, or back to TRL to promote more singles.
B000001EG6|3.0|You know sensitive piano ballad albums, they often have a moody front cover, a photo of our hero looking 'emotional', perhaps as if deep in thought, awakening that inner genius to write some great lyric or spine-chilling melody. Or, perhaps, since back in 1970 no-one knew who Elton John was, a moody photo of someone looking emotional was, somewhere by themself, was to entertain the idea this was some how sensitive singer/songwriter piano ballad music. And perhaps, the listener will be rather pleased in that regard, most notably the 'sensitive' part.    Elton John's sophomore 'debut album' shows Elton wearing Bernie Taupin's heart fairly and squarely on his sleeve, which means, well, I guess you could say 'heartfelt'. Although a fan's favourite target, 'First episode at Hienton' is particularly engaging, with it's ringing, eerie synths, and the harpsichord driven delicacy of 'I need you to turn to'. It is definitely his enthusiasm that drives the rockers; there aren't any guitars on them. And then there's that Paul Buckmaster. What an imaginative lad he is, and this is possibly his finest outing (with Elton)    Elton wouldn't be one of those people who believes in 'too much of a good thing' now would he? Oh ok, so it's just a coincidence that a lot of these songs sound VERY SIMILAR. He has proved over the last 40 years how diverse he can be, even if this album is narrow-focused. Be sure to pick up the bonus tracks for the energy assault of 'Bad side of the moon', don't worry, it's not as scary as it sounds! Rating ***1/4 (3.25)
B000024D4R|5.0|This album is my very favorite of pink floyd. You might think I'm crazy, it did take some getting used to but it is by far  the best. This album is the real Pink Floyd not who you wanted them to be, themselfs. Take my advice and buy this album.<BR>You will be very happy you did. Especially if your stoned.
B00006RINF|5.0|This is one of the greatest bands on the music stage.<br />It's almost perfect harmony between beautiful voice of Cristina Scabbina and male vocal. I have also got all CD's of Nightwish and yes it's also great but male vocals are horrible :(<br />All songs on this CD are very catchy and you easily sing to it :)<br />Do yourself a pleasure and buy Comalies couse it's really good album better than this crappy Fallen from Evanescence.
B00007J4SI|5.0|Ponti's piano is unusually bright and sparkling.  This however, is ideally suited to Scriabin's music.  Ponti explores fully Scriabin's vibrant and often complex rhythms.  Ponti has an amazing technique and it almost sounds as if he is losing control in some of the very demanding pieces, especially the etudes.  This has the effect of enhancing the excitement of the music.<BR>A cheap but really good purchase.
B0000C9JFO|5.0|this is a heartfelt, though sometimes odd, film about young-20s strangers from several european countries living together in an apartment in spain. the film is funny and poignant, yet seems to be somewhat of a metaphor for the developing European Union. I highly recommend this film to anyone, french speakers or not.
B00005JLEU|5.0|The great Miyazaki has done it AGAIN!!!  He has produced a film of wonderous vistas, depth and emotions that no other anime director can come close to.  The characters are sympathic and draw the viewer into the story without making him/her feel like they are watching a \\"cartoon\\".  I have been a fan of Miyazaki since I first saw \\"Warriors of the Wind\\" 20 years ago.  Even though that film was butchered by Orion Pictures, the production values of the animation hooked me into the Japanime galaxy.  It is refreshing to see such wonderful stories of life to come from the mind of such a amazing director!!!  I put this in the top 5 of my list of my favorite anime features.
B0001I55OC|3.0|First of all, I must confess that I have not read the novel by Michael Crichton on which the movie is based. Therefore, I cannot comment on the quality and / or fidelity of the adaptation. The movie explores the same idea several others have applied in the past, time travel, but the setting is a period that is not the most usual. It seems that traveling to Arthurian settings is the most successful formula, but in this case the time leap is to the fourteen century in Castlegard, France. &quot;Timeline&quot; does not present a lot of new elements or a surprising plot, it is mainly a formulaic approach to a previously explored subject. The only contributions to this &quot;mini-genre&quot; are improved special effects and costume and set design.<br />The movie starts when a man suddenly materializes in the middle of a deserted highway, dressed in medieval clothes and dying; his final word is &quot;Castlegard&quot;. A representative of an organization called International Technology Corporation (ITC), for which the dead man worked, immediately shows up at the hospital to claim the body and to try to hamper any further investigation. However, the doctors have enough time to find out that the blood vessels and organs in the deceased are misaligned and have no idea what the explanation may be.<br />At the same time, a group of archeologists that are funded by ITC finds the six-hundred-year-old ruins of Castlegard. Chris, the son of the chief archeologist in the expedition, Professor Johnston, is not very interested in the ruins, but he wants to hang around because he is in-love with his father's assistant.<br />When Chris's father leaves the site to go to the corporate offices of ITC to talk business, the team at the archeological site keeps on working and makes a stunning discovery. Among the ruins Chris and his beloved Kate, find a note from the professor asking for help and a broken glass that confirms the identity of the sender of the message. Trying to make sense of this Chris and Kate, along with four other friends, go to ITC looking for some answers. What they find is a time machine that was used by the professor to go back in time to Castlegard, France in 1357. Now they have to go back to the rescue and immerse themselves in a dangerous adventure.<br />This is the type of movie that you should choose to watch being aware that there is nothing outstanding about it, not the acting, the plot or any other aspect. It may be though a good way to spend a couple of hours entertained, since you will not need to pay a lot of attention or follow the action very closely to perfectly understand what is going on. This is definitely a movie that I do not recommend to buy, since I think most people will not find any added value from watching it a second time.is Chris and Kate, along with four other friends, go to ITC looking for some answers.

B00003CXBK|5.0|I finally got to watch &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; on DVD.  I was blown away!!!  What can you say about Miyazaki that hasn't already been said?  Beautiful, breathtaking, fantastic, wonderous... etc!!!  I hope there are many more such films coming from the pen of this visionary of film.  It is a must see for all fans of Japanime and especially of Miyazaki.
B00008YJHC|2.0|Someone has to say it, even if it gets me the dreaded &quot;not useful&quot; ratings for being negative about a CD from one of the best rock bands of all time. If you liked the raw sound of Surfer Rosa or Doolittle (two of the greatest CDs of all time), or the greatest hits/live double CD, Death to the Pixies, don't count on liking this. Despite 60 or 70 good reviews below.<br />This is the Pixies very toned down. There are a few songs I enjoy - mildly - every 5 years or so, like Digging for Fire and Velouria, but this CD was where I started to lose interest in this band. I could go on for pages about the greatness of the Pixies or Surfer Rosa. I think Kim Deal kept making good music for a long time after the Pixies. But the Pixies became boring to me right about here.<br />Your mileage may vary, but personally I'd go for Surfer Rosa, then Doolittle, any of the live CD's that come into print, and maybe even the new Wave of Mutilation best-of. And then to the Breeders and Amps if I want to keep the Kim Deal connection. In at least one rabid Pixies fan's opinion, if you don't need a complete Pixies collection, better to buy something from another band than this.<br />If you like Frank Black's solo work, or if you like other later Pixies CD's like Trompe Le Monde, disregard this - you may like Bossanova as well. It's just a huge break from the early sound of the band.

B000000W94|5.0|Many of Moore's &quot;blues&quot; albums are bogged down by his speed and technical brilliance (kinda a left handed compliment).  On this release, however, Moore shows patience and restraint in his playing and the results are stunning.     Moore is  not simply &quot;imitating&quot;  Peter Green's playing on this album, but enhancing it with his own unique style.  I have yet to hear any other blues guitarist come this close to the magic that  was once &quot;The Green God&quot;.  A must have for any Gary Moore or Peter Green fan.
B000003TA4|5.0|I decided to pick up this CD since i always liked &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; &quot;Come As You Are&quot; and &quot;Lithium&quot;, and i expected only the singles to be good since everyone is always saying how overrated Nirvana is, but the are VERY wrong.<br />This is one of those very very rare CDs where everysong is good and u can listen and ejnoy the whole thing! the only song I skip is &quot;Territorial Pissing,&quot; probably b/c of the annoying intro, anyways, this is WAY better than in Utero even tho the radio In Utero songs are awesome.<br />1.

0446310786|5.0|Scout's mother, Tom Robinson, and Boo Radley never or rarely speak for themselves, but they cast long shadows on one little girl's life.  What made this book a gem for me was the way Harper Lee allows the reader to fill in the landscape.   Atticus tousels the hair of a little girl before delivering bad news that will change her life forever; we are left to guess how it must remind him of telling his own daughter that mom will never return.  He replies to his sister, &quot;I do the best I can with them (the kids)&quot;, leaving his grief unstated.  <br />In a time of public disgraces and eternal processing of emotion, Harper Lee's book is a reminder of a time of privacy, decorum, and  the power of what is left unsaid.
1592400876|5.0|I thought Lynne Truss' book was fantastic.  As a self-diagnosed stickler of punctuation and grammar for years, I was happy to hear I was not the only person who physically cringed at the title of the movie, &quot;Two Weeks Notice.&quot; (For those of you who don't realize what there is about the title to cringe about, perhaps this is not the best book for you.)<BR>  True, the author is, at times, a bit snobby and haughty, but the perception that proper punctuation and good grammar should only be discussed in the upper echelons of educated society is ridiculous.  <BR>  Truss makes us all responsible for the disintegration of our language into nothing more but a collection of slang, made-up words, dashes and ellipses. To be honest, I am a little more than concerned about the proper punctuation of this on-line review....
B0000024TT|5.0|This is a perfect recording, Cohen's best. It's one of the 10 best recordings of the 1960s. This record changed the face of popular music for decades to come. I can think of so many,  who came out of this one recording directly or indirectly...even today.
B000002MFN|5.0|well it has been 12 years now since the release of, in my opinion,is the best madonna album to date, why is that? 'cause if you listen the cd right now you will notice that is TIMELESS it could be released right now and it would be fresh and still interesting, i'm a 19 year old guy, and i'm so ashamed that i could'nt enjoy this album the way that it has to be done 'cause i was only 7 years old, well lets talk about the music><br />the thing that i will always be upset with Madge is that Bye Bye Baby should've NEVER BE RELEASED  as a single, that was the place of my favorite dance tune (From Erotica) from Ms. M of course THIEF OF HEARTS!!! i will never forgive her for that huge mistake! the rest of the album of course its Madonna at her best i give all the tracks a perfect 10 except to bye bye baby you know....
B00005Q45W|4.0|I would have rated this record higher but I didn't love all the cuts. Still, comparing this cd to Cohen's others, it's one of his best. OK, why the 4 stars? Well... I actually love Cohen when I like him but when I don't like him I hate him. Leonard Cohen has genius, but he lacks continuity. I've been a Cohen fan since the 60s and I know his music pretty well. Cohen seems to wander around...as a person who is driven by life and circumstances will do. Thats the key to understanding Cohen's short comings, musically speaking. Where Dylan's lyrics are clearly secondary to his music, Cohen seems to be more lyrically focused...at least his literary side overshadows his musical abilities more often than not. I use to think he was maybe the best spokesman for my age. He's really preaching at times. Then other times you can hear his musical abilities come through. Start and stop. Stop and start. Cohen just never had the run Dylan's had, because with Dylan it's about the music always.  Still Cohen's out put is overall better than Charles Aznavour, but they share some of the same structual weaknesses. In Aznavour case it's the lack of good material.  Two careers, that needed good management. But like I implied, Cohen is a preacher, not a business man. I wonder if Cohen lacked good collaborators? Great musicians who could make it happen? Maybe he wasn't as lucky with friends in the business as others. Whatever it is/was I think Cohen has had very few perfect records. This one is as close as he's come in a while.  So..this one may do it for you, at least in places.
B0001L3MI0|5.0|Yes, the plot is ridiculous and riddled with Texas-sized holes.<br />Yes, the dialogue is cheesy and the characters lacking.<br />Yes, it's just a vehicle for pretty special effects.<br />And the problem is... what?<br />This was not supposed to be a great cinematic masterpiece. It was not supposed to be a moving epic or a heartrending drama - it set out to be an \\"aliens attack earth and we kill them\\" fast paced action-heavy plot-lite popcorn flick, and that's EXACTLY what it is. <br />It's mindless, it's inconsequential, it's FUN. Don't go in expecting anything more than two hours of disposable multi-million dollar special-effects-laden blockbuster trash, and you won't be disappointed.<br />Highly recommended.
B00005JKHN|5.0|I bought the Disney's Sleeping Beauty on DVD for my daughter's first christmas...but in all honesty I really bought it for myself.  I love all of Disney's fairytale adaptations, and this one is one of my favorites, right up there with Cinderella and Beauty and the Beast.<br />Althought the animation is done by hand and not by the newest digital technology(by computer), it looks a little dated compared to some of the newer animation movies released by Disney.  Like other Disney classics released on DVD, they have remastered the film and made the colors vivid. You can also chose what format you want to watch the film in either full or wide screen.  Not to mention added lots of bonus materials including some about the making and design of the movie, which should be interesting to adults that have seen this movie during their childhood.  Also there are a couple of games included on the DVD which are good if your children are old enough to play on the computer(my daughter is only 6 months so she is not quite ready for those).  Another interesting feature found on the DVD is about the music, if it sounds formiliar that is because it was written by composer Peter Tchaikovsky, Disney only added lyrics to the music scores of the &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; ballet.<br />The story is excellent, one for the ages.  The only thing that I have caution about is that if you have younger children I would think twice about showing them this movie, speaking from personal exprience, when I first saw this movie at the age of five our six I was very scared when the wicked fairy Maleficent transformed into a fire breathing dragon. I really don't plan on showing my daughter this movie until see gets much older, being only a baby now I don't think will have much interest in it now anyway.<br />I definitely recommend Sleeping Beauty to your Disney DVD collection.
B0001L3MI0|1.0|This is DVD marketing at its ugliest, worst case scenario. What is this, the third version now? <br />I have the two disc ultimate, or whatever it was, from last year and it's good enough despite a nasty chapter change sequence after the gang escapes the White House. The thing just freezes outright and sloppily cuts into the next chapter. There isn't any scratches on the disc, so I'm assuming that's one of the errors that this release will supposedly correct.<br />The movie itself gets 4 stars from me because it's shameless, B sci fi with a grade A budget. It's not meant to be logical, it's straight up fun. <br />Special mention has to go to an incredible score by David Arnold. This was his follow up punch to his amazing Stargate score, and he has never come close again to the heights of ID4 and Stargate music compositions. I consider him a two hit wonder, and the soundtrack to this movie sorely needs to be redone with the other 50 percent of the score restored to the CD. <br />Anyways, pardon that digression. If you don't own this movie already, and you like sci-fi, go ahead and get this version and don't look back. If nothing else, it's a lot more entertaining than the Star Wars prequels and it will show off your DVD player and television's capabilities. <br />(...)
B00006JJ51|5.0|Nearly anyone who knows anything about hip-hop should already be familiar with this album, but here are a few things you may not know. NWA didn't start with &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot; or with the album &quot;NWA and the Posse&quot;.  NWA were the kings of the maxi-single.  Maxi-singles were 12 inch records with more than the normal 2 songs. Their first one was the Eazy-E maxi-single with &quot;Boyz in tha Hood&quot;, &quot;Fat Girl&quot; and &quot;LA is the Place&quot; in 1987. Then came the &quot;Panic Zone&quot;, &quot;Dope Man&quot;, &quot;8 Ball&quot; maxi, credited to NWA. The picture on that cover was used for the &quot;NWA and the Posse&quot; album, which for some reason, contained the radio version of &quot;8 Ball&quot; instead of the street version.  Next came another Eazy-E maxi with &quot;Eazy Duz It&quot;, &quot;Ruthless Villian&quot;, &quot;Radio&quot;, and &quot;Compton's N Tha House&quot;, which was only issued on the cassette version as a bonus track.  This maxi introduced MC Ren, who stepped in while Ice Cube was away at college.  Cube returned for the next NWA maxi with &quot;Gangsta Gangsta&quot;, &quot;Something Like That&quot;, &quot;Quiet on tha Set&quot;, and &quot;Something 2 Dance 2&quot;.  After all of these maxi-singles, they released the Eazy-E album &quot;Eazy Duz It&quot;, followed by the NWA album &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot;.  The sixth person on the &quot;Compton&quot; album cover is not The DOC as some have stated, it's Arabian Prince.  He was featured on &quot;Something 2 Dance 2&quot;, but apparently left the group during the course of recording the album. Since &quot;Something 2 Dance 2&quot; is arguably the weakest song on the album, and is the only song he recorded with the group, it was not a great loss.  The bonus tracks on this remastered cd come from the maxi-single released after the album. These were the groups final recordings with Ice Cube.  A year later they returned with their final maxi-single &quot;100Miles and Runnin&quot; which contained the title cut, &quot;Just Don't Bite It&quot;, &quot;Sa Prize (Part 2)&quot;,&quot;Real Ni---z&quot;, and &quot;Kamurshol&quot;-a plug for their next forthcoming album released the following year.  Those songs are bonus tracks on the remastered version of &quot;Ni---z 4 Life&quot;, which musically speaking at least, is better than &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot; so cop that one too!
038533348X|4.0|I read this book almost a year ago.  So my memory is a little rusty, but at the same time, the really good parts and the really not so good parts stick out.  <br />While I was reading this book, it kind of bored me.  It takes a great amount of action to really keep me interested in stuff, though.  I think I may have a light case of ADD.  Anyway, the religious words that Vonnegut made up kind of jumbled together in my mind, and I just pretty much confused one for another.  I don't know.  I just felt kind of bored throughout the book.  <br />It was good, though.  I'm glad I read it.  It's kind of like 1984, it kind of sucks as you're reading it because it's so damn boring, but when you get through it, you think to yourself, &quot;Damn it, that was a good book!  I'm really glad I read it!  Everything was just great!&quot;  Cat's Cradle is kind of like this.  1984 was better, though.  And then again, I like chemistry, and the whole ice-9 thing is chemistry related.  Haha, I'm a dork.  <br />Read Slaughter House Five first, if you've never read Vonnegut before.  SHF rocked!
B0001DI0FI|1.0|I went to the theatre and saw this film the first day it came out. It was differant but i loved it. I couldn't wait for the DVD to be released. However once i saw that there were two versions, and one of the versions cost twice as much as the other i was to say the least angry. One version is just the movie and it costs just the same as any other DVD (might as well just wait for it to come on cable). The other version (the collectors addition) contains all the extra's that you would find on any other DVD movie only they are expecting you to pay twice as much for something you would normaly get for the regular price of a dvd. What a scam. That is the reason i will only give it one star. Like i said, i loved the movie, however the value when buying the DVD is terrible.
B000002VFW|4.0|What can i say about this lady Lisa Stansfield who put out the best soul album (yes that music played by African- Americans before it got corrupted by bad singers and even worse by sexist, violent terrible gangsta rap music)since 1990 if you want to hear good R&B you have to listen to brit singers like Stansfield what can you say about her solo debut (she was in the brit dance collective coldcut) she has done better albums but this her most soulful collection of songs that harken back to African- American music's past but looks foward with british soul that would spawn groups like the Brand New Heavies, Joss Stone,Stansfield, the Heavies, Sade and Omar practically kept this style of music alive until Neosoul saved black music in the late 90's well what can you say about the classic \\"BEEN AROUND THE WORLD\\" with it's classic barry white/ gamble and huff type string arrangements but this song does not fly without her beautiful vocal pharsing that harkens back to Gladys Knight and Aretha Franklin puntuating with just the right stylings without oversinging and losing focus and \\"this is the right time\\" with it's uptempo vibe makes this the best Soul album of the 90's no other album comes close in the decade that black music lost it's focus to Rap Music(not hip-hop) get this album now and you will not be sorry.
B00006J3WH|5.0|Buffy is the best show to ever grace the tv screen. The musical was one of its best episodes. Stand outs for me were Rest in Peace, Wish I could Stay and walk through the fire. Awesome cd. You guys should also check out Ghost of the Robot which is James Marsters' (Spike) band. He is the lead singer and plays guitar. You can get it at their web site, which I think is just ghostoftherobot.com.
B000078DOH|5.0|Freaky Styley is without question not only the funkiest Red Hot Chili Peppers album, but also one of the best funk albums since the heyday of Parliament/Funkadelic. After getting mixed results with their self titled debut, the Chili Peppers stepped up their game musically thanks to the return of original member Hillel Slovak and the strong production by the godfather of funk, George Clinton. Every song is worth listening to, especially Jungle Man, The Brothers Cup, If You Want Me To Stay, and Catholic School Girls Rule. Freaky Styley doesn`t have the strong songs and production of the later albums, but it`s definitely a good old school album.
038073186X|5.0|I was a big fan of Mystic River but in my opinion, this one is even better.  It is a truly original story with a combination of Sherlockian locked room mystery with Stephen King creepiness.  I could not put it down.  And the ending is a total surprise.
B000002H2H|5.0|Ride the Lightning was the start of the golden era of Metallica. It is a great album of musical aggression. All the tracks on there are worth listening to, especially the classics For Whom The Bell Tolls and Fade To Black, which is the best song on the album IMO. This album was a huge step forward for Metallica and really kicked them to the top of the metal heap.
B00014TQ7S|4.0|Excellent vocals, rough edge like early New Order.  I heard it first on a Boston college FM station and I thought, how could I have not heard this before (thinking it was part of an 80's show) ? The DJ said, 'that was Franz Ferdinand' and I thought, 'Go Austria !'. Alas they are Scots. I don't usually buy an album based on one song, but I'm glad I did.
B00005JM20|3.0|My wife and I rented this movie because we usually find Atkinson to be pretty hilarious. Unfortunately, he falls well short in this effort, a spoof on spy films. To put it bluntly, I think they expect too much of him in this film. He does not possess the comic genius of say a Peter Sellers, to pull it off.<br />Sure there are some pretty funny scenes, but the laughs are too few. The movie even stoops to bathroom humor to try and get some laughs, but even this tactic does not really work very well. Therefore, I would not recommend this movie unless you are really in the mood for a spy parody type film. While Atkinson's humor is much cleaner than Mike Myers, the film is also a lot less funny than any of the Austin Powers movies.
B00005JMEW|2.0|As I prepared to watch this movie, my expectations were high  because a friend of mine had told me how awesome it was.  It failed to meet most of those expectations.  I expected it to be original, and, my gosh, did it deliver on that.  The music was an incredible mix of about 6-7 different genres, and, somehow, it worked.  The whole sense of style of the movie screamed &quot;original&quot; throughout.  What was disappointing, however, was the fighting, which was the focus of the movie.  The first fight was far too short in my opinion, and the ending was not cool in the slightest. The second fight scene with the Yakuza gang just seemed like a big excuse to spray blood.  That practice became tiresome quickly.  Then the last fight of the film wasted the potential it had.  It started off playing some really cool music, and the two warrior women were evenly matched, trading blows and the then-energy-filled fight looked it would reach a great climax. Surprise, surprise, though, Beatrix's back is slashed, the music stops and a minute later O'ren no longer has her scalp.  Lastly, in case you were wondering, the inane plot is only there the give some reason for all the violence and blood, which I thought was excessive.  This would be strictly 1-star material if the movie didn't have so much originality.
B000148KK2|5.0|Diana continues to simply amaze me with her talent!
B000148KK2|5.0|Although in many ways this is dramatically different from Diana's earlier albums, it's remarkable how natural and comfortable she sounds here, as if she had always recorded in this style.  There is great range in the songs she sings on this record, from lust to loss, from Love Me Like a Man to Departure Bay. Her version of Almost Blue, I think, will make this song into the modern standard it deserves to be. The songs she wrote with Elvis Costello are deeply touching, very personal, revealing Diana to be a gifted melodist and confirming Elvis's skill as a lyricist. These songs are reminiscent of the 1970s singer-songwriter period, calling to mind Joni Mitchell (whose Black Crow Diana does a moving and spirited version of) and, especially on Narrow Daylight, Jackson Brown.  Yet the songs are Diana's own, and, though they are rich in personal detail and recollection, they nonetheless have a universal feel. They speak to our need to cling to detailed memory when personal loss leaves us nothing else.  And while most of the songs deal in one way or another with loss or world weariness, they aren't self-pitying or morose.<br />It's great to hear Diana's piano once again at the forefront, and her accompanists are without exception excellent. Anyone who doubts that this is a jazz album either hasn't listened carefully or has too narrow a conception of what jazz is. (Take my word for it, it swings.) And the Amazon reviewer who thought that the album was monotonous--an album as varied as this...? I don't know what album that reviewer was listening to. I can't believe he was listening to the same one I was.
B00005KFUM|1.0|Hmmmmmmm....sounds awfully familiar.  Sounds like Radiohead.  If you own a Radiohead CD don't buy this album.  Your not hearing this from some pretensious wannabe musician that claims they have a seasoned ear for this kind of stuff because they play the piano, your hearing this from someone who has an unbiased ear and is calling a spade a spade.  Muse might be a great band, but this album carries a sound that has already been played.

B00008OLYN|4.0|At first I was not sold on this Cd but it gradually grew on me. Now I am really liking it. I like this album as a whole, rather than for each individual song. The songs are well written, tranquil and consistant.
B00006G8HX|4.0|There was a point in time where I really wished that this movie had not been made.  The death of Spock at the end of &quot;Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan,&quot; was a high point in the history of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe.  When Spock, separated by a thick piece of plastic shielding, tells Kirk for the last time &quot;I have been and always shall be your friend,&quot; it is a devastating moment.  Kirk and Spock are one of the great &quot;odd&quot; friendships of all time, in or out of the realm of science fiction (they are the Aubrey and Maturin of their future time and place).  The &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise was served by this 1984 film, since it spawned three more outings for the original cast and inspired a quartet of television spinoffs, but I am not sure if the characters benefited as well.  I still think &quot;Wrath of Khan&quot; is far and away the best &quot;Star Trek&quot; film, with &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot; coming in second.  There are some nice moment with Spock on &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation,&quot; although there are more between Captain Picard and Sarek, Spock's father, and the death of James T. Kirk in &quot;Star Trek: Generations&quot; certainly pales compared to that of Spock.<br />So making this third &quot;Star Trek&quot; film took something away the death of Spock, but even wishing it had never been made I still have to admit this film has its moment.  The whole Vulcan &quot;katra&quot; bit is a deus ex machina pulled out of a hat and Spock's tube landing on the Genesis planet so that his body can be regenerated, growing at precisely the right rate so that when the download Spock's katra from McCoy's mind we are back to where we were at the end of the previous movie is just an absurd conjunction of circumstances.  But at the heart of this film is the relationship between Kirk and Spock.  William Shatner's performance in the key scenes, early on when he relives Spocks' death with Sarek and at the end when Spock is restored, have a weight that overcomes a lot of objections and which is clearly privileged by Harve Bennett's script and Leonard Nimoy's direction.<br />That friendship has always been there and many of the high points of the original television series were where it was acknowledged, albeit almost always obliquely.  At the end of &quot;Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan&quot; it was made painfully explicit, and that powerful moment is revisited at the end of &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock,&quot; as Kirk stands there before his friend, having sacrificed his only son and the ship that has been his home for what seems like his entire life, because &quot;The needs of the one outweighed the needs of the many.&quot;  This flip of Spock's motivation for going into that chamber and sacrificing his life is not glib, because it speaks to a great human paradox.  Namely that we believe both positions are true and that not only do the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the one but that the exact opposite is true.  Each film in turn proves its thesis.k is restored, have a weight that overcomes a lot of objections and which is clearly privileged by Harve Bennett's script and Leonard Nimoy's direction.  <br />That friendship has always been there and many of the high points of the original television series were where it was acknowledged, albeit almost always obliquely.

B0000AXE8I|1.0|This was on par for sequels, which means it was horrible.  Besides the blatant commercialism, there was no threat in the fight scenes any longer.  This reduced them to flying tag matches.  The love story is sappy and the character speeches are tedious.  Save your money and watch the first one again.
B00018D3RI|5.0|It's got it all. Action, humor, great cast, fine acting. Worth every penny I spent on it. When is the 2nd season available?
B000001IPL|4.0|Too bad the offspring isnt like this anymore. Everysong freaking rocks!!
B00006JDS4|1.0|Im not going to lie to you, but you do have to be slightly disturbed and/or sick to actually enjoy this movie. What can be enjoyable about watching a girl getting gang raped numerous times? And to say this is not worse than the likes of Deliverance is insane. Yes, there is a male rape scene in Deliverance, which again was not at all enjoyable to watch and i shall not be watching again, but the scene in that movie is far shorter and far less graphic than the rape scenes in I Spit On Your Grave. So basically, if you have any sanity and/or morals you will not enjoy this movie as there is absolutely nothing in the movie to enjoy.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|Gilmore Girls is the perfect show for everyone to watch: clever characters and storylines, along with very high-quality acting. The relationship between Rory and Lorelai is inspiring and the show has a real fairy tale-like charm to it! It makes me feel great whenever I watch it. The kooky characters are so true to small town life.<BR>This is another response to the booklet question. I think there was a problem with the DVD sets sent into Canada. I have been in internet forums and at least four other people from Canada did not get a booklet. I am still trying to contact Warner Home Video but no one wants to deal with our problem; they just keep on telling me to try phoning another number or to e-mail another address. This is not fair- we are getting ripped off. If anyone in Canada does have a DVD booklet, where did you purchase it? I just exchanged my copy that didn't have a booklet only to find out that my new set didn't have one either. This is very frustrating. Anyone with information would really help.<BR>Anyway, it's still one of the best shows on television and every fan should own the DVD boxed set. To anyone wondering if they should buy it- DO IT!! You will definitely not regret it.
B0000508U6|5.0|Parachutes is quite possibly the best album that has been released since Kurt Cobain's death. Prior to the release of the album, rock had become a loud, angry place of personal expression, a place for angst and rage. While these emotions are totally acceptable in my book (in fact, I like a lot of angry music), Coldplay redefined rock when Parachutes was released. I heard Yellow on every radio station in this state, including our thrash rock paradise 93X. The song (and the band) represent a massive reorientation of rock in the new millenium.<BR>I'll write a song-by-song review, because its worth it.<br />Don't Panic: Coldplay could not have started a CD in better form. I wish it wasn't only two minutes long. (Though I would maintain that they start Rush of Blood with Politik just as well.) 5 stars.<br />Shiver: Could have been the follow up to Yellow. However, the band picked Trouble, probably because the song simply has more artistic merit. This track gets a little obnoxious after a while anyway. 4 stars.<br />Spies: Totally out of genre for Chris Martin, but it is a great song. One can really almost feel the Bends vibe on this track. Really an underrated song. 5 stars.<br />Sparks: Soft, unnotable music. It's very good, it just doesn't fit between tracks 3 and 5. 4 stars.<br />Yellow: Everyone's heard it, and knows what they think of it. My opinion: it's a great rock love song. I haven't yet heard a better one. 5 stars.<br />Trouble: Really morose, arguably more so than their later Scientist. In my opinion, that is not the case, but this track is certainly musically and lyrically more creative than the Scientist. 5 stars.<br />Parachutes: Only about a minute long, but it's really pretty. Should have been a full length track. 4 stars.<br />High Speed: The first track they recorded for this album. Actually, it's kind of a stupid song. 2 stars.<br />We Never Change: Kind a sweet, slow piano ballad. If that's not your cup of tea, then it would make sense. Otherwise, its a good song. 4.5 stars.<br />Everything's Not Lost: The title alone has a warm, reassuring tone to it. After you hear this song when they're in concert, you go home and listen to it for days on end. Unquestionably 5 stars.<br />Hidden Track/Life Is For Living: I wish they'd replaced High Speed with this. They play this in concert, too, and even though you could teach a two year old to play in on the piano in about twelve seconds, it's a great tune. 5 stars.<br />Obviously, these sentiments are all based on my own personal opinion. A lot of people disagree with me. But the things I am drawn to in music are real attempts at art; at something really  meaningful and emotional. That doesn't write off thrash rock or any other genre of rock. In fact, it lets you really appreciate the diversity of music. What I'm getting at is, even if you're someone who hasn't turned your Metallica down in over six years, you should still, go out and buy this album, because it's still the best rock album of the nascent century.
B000148KK2|5.0|The write below who has a hard time with playing this in his computer is simply WRONG!<br />This CD will play on any computer after you put it in (i've tried it on my Mac &amp; PC as well as at work on a PC). You do not have to register with her fan club first. <br />simply start you favorite music software (I use iTunes or MusicMatch) after the little ad for her website runs. and then press play. very simple. You can close that ad out easily by clicking the X in the upper right hand corner. <br />What's so hard about that?<br />Basically I did sign up for her fan list because Krall is now offering FREE advance access to her fans for purchasing concert tickets. most other big name bands are charging for this luxury.<br />The only thing on this disc that is different at all is the little ad for her website/fan list. That ad does not prevent you from doing anything - it may stop your music player software from auto starting though. Simply start it up manually and press play and do whatever you would have done on your computer after that.  . . .<br />I wote a prior review about the music - personally I think it is brilliant. I did not want to hear more standards from Krall and this is a great direction for her. I never can understand why some people feel entitled to their personal vision of what the artist is.....more fun for me to follow where the artist is going. If I don't care for it I move to a new discovery.....<br />enjoy this album - I feel it her best yet
B0001GOH6Q|1.0|Tim Burton is on a roll (to early retirement).  This is the third dismal movie he has directed in a row.  Relying heavily on picture perfect &quot;aren't we imaginative&quot; sets that look television commercials quality and less on building some tension and plot Big  Fish is as much fun as watching a fish out of water suffocate to death. The biggest offense in this movies is the talk-over narration.  Could you imagine a movie like &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; if we had to listen to Dorothy blab on and on about what she had experienced instead of allowing us to discover the wonders along side her? If you have seen one of those tedious &quot;In a town called perfect&quot; tv ads with all the sugary nursery muzak you've already seen Big Fish.  Avoid this movie if you have any discretion on how you spend your time.
0778320448|3.0|This is the first book by Debbie Macomber I have read.  In fact,until a month ago I had never heard of her.  Now I find she has a website and seems to be quite involved with her many fans.  In fact, for her book tour to promote this book she is doing signings at yarn shops and inviting her fans to knit a square while there to be joined together and assembled into blankets and donated to charities.  I was more impressed with THAT than the actual book!<br />Not to say this isn't a decent story.  It was a fun, fast read.  I have been reading every book of knitting stories I can lay my hands on, and when I came across a novel on the topic, I thought I'd give it a try.  Since I live in the Pacific Northwest and am familiar with Seattle, it was easy to visualize a lot of the background presented in the story.  However, I thought the writing a little shallow and I kept wishing for a bit more depth of the characters as I read. I wanted more about the knitting and the goings on at the yarn shop than the outside lives of the three women who came to learn to knit.  Some threads got dropped like lost stitches off knitting needles!<br />I do see there is room for a sequel to this book, as the yarn shop owner could become involved with a new group of knitting students and that could become an even better read than this one was.<br />Now, having said all that, I still intend to go to the book signing event in mid-May to do my little part in completing a part of one of the blankets.  I absolutely LOVE the idea of this type of book tour.  I hope it sparks more authors to come up with fresh ideas to not only promote their books, meet their fans, create a little more community, AND do something good for local organizations.

B000003TAB|5.0|Incesticide is a collection of b-sides and old demos released in the winter of 1992.  It gives the listener a great look at what Nirvana was doing in between Bleach and Nevermind.  It includes the 1990 single Sliver, and its b-side, Dive.  It also has 1989's been a son, which can also be found on the self titled greatest hits album.  There are also covers of Devo and the Vaselines, as well as a &quot;punk rock&quot; version of polly and some old demos like hairspray queen and aero zepplin.  This is a must for all Nirvana fans.

IF IT IS IT AINT FUNNY!!!<BR>when the single my band was released i thought o.k, this is rubbish but maybe, just maybe the album will be differant! BOY WAS I WRONG!!  i know 5 other people who have bought the album and they ALL took it back to the shops the day after they bought it!! i wouldnt even use the c.d inlet booklet to wipe my a*s!! and the only thing the disc is good for is using it as a place mat for a hot drink!! and theres a bonus disc so you can use two c.ds for your drinks and the inlet booklet to make a fire!!!<BR>to sum it up d12 world is:<br />1) poorly produced<br />2) rubbish lyrics (even from proof)<br />and 3) a waste of money!!<br />gpo for some &quot;proper&quot; rap such as cypress hill: till death do us part, wu-tang clan, ghostface, nwa, mobb deep,royce 59, method man,tupac,b.i.g., even outkast is better than this!!!<br />i am very dissapointed with this album!!!
B0001906O0|2.0|Five stars:<br />It's good to see a non-bootleg CD with remasters of all the fantastic B-sides from the 1986 cassette-only version of Standing On a Beach. I have waited a long, long time for this (and I still wait patiently for the original Star Wars on DVD).<br />But...<br />Minus 1 star:<br />They really should have released a separate disc with ONLY the Standing On a Beach B-sides about ten years ago. I would pay good money for disc 1 in this set, which is basically the equivalent. I would also shuck out for disc 2, but...<br />Minus another star:<br />What I definitely don't want to pay for is all the cheesy discharge that came out after 1990. I dearly love The Cure, but admit it, people. Everything from Wish onward is crap. It's time for the old boys to retire. Discs 3 and 4 are coasters.<br />Minus another freakin' star:<br />...oh yeah, and where the hell is Carnage Visors?!! Another cassette only track. I lost my copy that I was planning on burning to CD. Oh well, I'm sure someone will put it up on BearShare.<br />I suppose that makes 2 stars. Sorry, Bob.
B000089RVR|5.0|This is one of those albums you will play over and over. I'm not sure how I happened on Dido and this album, but I'm grateful that she found me. The music will carry you away, the lyrics are so personally authentic and revealing, and there is barely a bad apple in the barrel. Each song surprises and delights. Interestingly, most songs begin with a blend of electronic inventiveness, melancholy, and a slower tempo - serving as introduction to a story. Then, just when you think you're not going to like it, she bursts into an uptempo beat and the fully revealed story, leaving you enthusiastically singing along and thinking &quot;Yeah, I've felt like this.&quot; That such a young woman would perform with so much insight and wisdom about the struggles of love and life is quite astonishing. Her music messages embrace love without fear at each end of the relationship continuum, from co-dependency (Don't Leave Home) to healthy rejection (See You When You're Forty). This is a CD I'll have permanently loaded in my player for quite some time.
B000148KK2|1.0|This CD is a disappointment to me. The only track I like on this CD is &quot;Almost Blue&quot; in which Diana sounds more like herself and the song is more like a song.<BR>I am surprised that she actually came to Melbourne to promote it.<BR>Leslie Chen<BR>Donvale, Australia
0060512806|1.0|I am sorry, but I heard such wonderful things about this book, and as I attempt to read it, I am frankly annoyed at best. The man misuses, abuses, and downright ignores style.  So many times I have to read a metaphor and double take, wondering how he could have seriously wrote that down on paper. Not only are the metaphors often bizzare, there is typically more metaphoric content per page than there is storyline. <br />On the topic of storyline, it seems disjointed, shallow, and contrived. The only thing that flows worse than the story, is each sentence, which when they are proper sentences, often are choppy and erratic in form. It really is a chore to read this man's work. <br />One other minor complaint I have, (which pails in comparison with others) is the overuse and abuse of &quot;Haiku&quot; Haiku, which in it's native tongue is brilliant and beautiful form of art, is (to say the least) difficult to capture in English. Needless to say, I find the &quot;Haiku&quot; contained in this book to be somewhat lacking in Essence. <br />The auther has a brilliant mind for math, I am sorry that it doesn't seem to relate well to Literature.
B00006RCSR|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time! Of course, as its known by the title the story is based on the Cinderella fairy tale, but in this movie the heroine is smart and strong, yet vunerable at the same time. Drew Barrymore is great and Angelica Houston is just wondrously wicked as the evil step- mother. This movie is recomended to every woman!!!
B000148KK2|5.0|the first time i listened to the cd, i thought it was not as good (melody-wise) as the previous cds. but the more i listen, the more i'm beginning to appreciate the music, whether or not it's an original or an adaptation. now, i take the cd everywhere i go because after almost a week, i can now sing along with it.  true...diana rocks!!!

B000002H6C|5.0|Metallica has produced some of the best music of the last twenty years {&quot;...And Justice&quot;, &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;} and some of the worst {last year's &quot;St. Anger.&quot;}  The one that has always stood out for me, and I believe is a masterpiece, is &quot;...And Justice For All&quot;.<BR>     This album is brutal and uncompromising, but it does have moments if pure inspired beauty.  The opening to the entire album sets the stage for an amazing piece of work.  Every song is fantastic, but the standouts are &quot;Blackened&quot;, &quot;One&quot; &quot;Dyer's Eve&quot; and &quot;To Live is to Die&quot; an {almost} instrumental that is amazing, and there is one moment in the middle of the song that can almost bring you to tears.  If you listen, really listen to this album, you'll get sucked in to the complexities and amazing musicianship of it all.  This album is an experience.  At first listen it may seen a little overwhelming, and maybe even bland, but after a few listens you will probably grasp it better and have a better appreciation for it. <BR>     By far the best song on the album is &quot;One&quot;, an amazing song both lyrically and musically, another example of music on this album that can stir the emotions {the acoustic beginning is stunning, and there is no other word for it.} <BR>     If you are new to Metallica, this is a great place to start, but please keep in mind that there are significant differences in most of the albums.  &quot;Kill 'Em All&quot; and &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; are more raw than the later efforts, &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; and &quot;Justice&quot; are heavy and complex, &quot;Metallica&quot; is the start of their &quot;new&quot; sound that cotinued through the nineties, slower, but still heavy and pretty complex, &quot;Load&quot; and &quot;Reload&quot; are both mixed bags- they still sound like Metallica, but are very different from their other releases, and are average at best.  Then there are the next two releases, not albums of new material, but still pretty good nonetheless, the cover song album &quot;Garage Inc.&quot; {a mixed bag as well} and the live with a symphony &quot;S&amp;M&quot;.  I would recommend you start with a studio album or two first before you delve into those.  Ah...and then there's the newest, &quot;St. Anger.&quot;  Just my opinion here- but I believe that album is almost completly unredeemable, so be warned, if you want that one, try previewing it first to see if it's your thing.

1592400876|4.0|Truss warns readers that it is reviews just like these that lead to the proliferatioin of mispunctuation.  <br />This book is an enjoyable read for anyone who has ever been confused over just where to place a comma, or the proper use of the semicolon.  Truss offers up interesting tales of punctuation history with a sense of glee that is almost catching.  <br />Grammar snobs may turn their noses up at this Bestseller, but for the generally confused masses, it at least sparks the debate, which is what I suspect Ms Truss wants more than anything - to see puncuatioin live on indefinitely.

B000003TA4|1.0|Despite what the uninformed and close-minded believe, Rock music is not about the hate and blind rebelliousness Nirvana brought to the forefront. Rebellion has its place, but only in cases where there is no other alternative. Here are some rock bands/musicians that don't use hate in their music: Depeche Mode, They Might Be Giants, Elton John, Queen, The Beatles, John Lennon, and anyone but Nirvana and the people they are associated with. Nirvana had nothing to rightfully rebel against, so Kurt Cobain just made up things. Take, for instance, The Advocate cover story he did. Cobain thought he could be a spokesman for gay people just because people in high school teased him and said he was gay. The kicker is that Cobain asserted he was never gay, so again, why the hell was he allowed to do the interview?! Rock is all about taking a stand honestly, saying what you love, and talking about how to change the world to reverse it from the grips of those who hate and pretend to be what they are not. People say Nirvana were the birth of Alternative, but there is no question that bands like The Smashing Pumpkins still would've made it big without Nirvana.<br />Alt albums I suggest...<BR>Live \\"Throwing Copper\\"<BR>Smashing Pumpkins \\"Mellon Collie\\" and \\"Gish<BR>STP \\"Tiny Music\\" and \\"Purple\\" <BR>Blues Traveler \\"Four\\"<BR>The Grateful Dead
B0000CFW87|3.0|Okay, I'll just say it now: Josh Groban has a beautiful voice. There's no disagreeing that, but people are making him out like someting &quot;revolutionary&quot;.  No, people, he's NOT revolutionary. He has a pretty voice, but I can go on to Broadway and pick out a handful of actors who can sound just like him. The only difference is that he sings New Age, and they sing show tunes.<br />The CD is a nice listening, but quite frankly too many songs sound the same. Josh needs to stop perfecting his vocal techniques all the time and start to let loose and put some real emotions into his singing. Those years of vocal training can play against him, because he's a little too stiff and clinical for me. Start FEELING the songs, Josh, we already know you're perfect at everything else.
B00003CXCT|4.0|I haven't seen them and don't care which \\"edition\\" they are.  The fact that they will be on DVD is enough.  Our ESB is particularly degraded after being watched approximatly 1000 times by my nine year old in the past 8 years.  <br />Do I love the originals?  Yes. Did I find the SEs really special?  Not particularly.  Should Anakin be old in the \\"spirit\\" scene in RoTJ?  You bet.<br />But do I value getting rid of a fragile, cantankerous, and out dated piece of equipment more?  Absolutely.

B00008S2VG|1.0|The only collection of Madonna material worse than this would the stuff she did before &quot;Everybody.&quot;  It's not that bad, but close enough.  Seems in her recent history, she peeked with &quot;Ray Of Light,&quot; (single and album-wise), and has slid downhill since.<br />Known for throwaway lyrics, this album's full of them.  In the case of &quot;Music&quot; (the single), production &amp; vocals made up for the so-so lyrics.  With &quot;Die Another Day,&quot; production alone saved so-so vocals and vapid lyrics.  With &quot;American Life,&quot; (the album), you have a complete 11-course meal of some of Maddy's worst lyrics, laziest vocals, and most self-indulgent work ever.  What is of interest here is Mirwais' production, which unfortunately, still can't give any of these numbers a chance on the charts - except for the Dance Chart, where remixes have managed to prolong the inevitable demise of AL.  <br />I feel dissappointed in that while Madonna may have met her most innovative collaborator in Mirwais, she has in turn become the union's weakest link.  Madonna, go find the groove, and get back into it!

B0001CCXZW|5.0|I received my Gilmore Girls in the mail on the day it came out.  Hooray!  Question, is there supposed to be a small booklet in the packaging?  At the front of the boxet there is a small envelope/folder area that would typically hold a booklet, but mine was empty.  Just curious if anyone out there has anything different?  Other than that, I am especially excited to get my DVD set.  With Smallville and Dawson's Creek and other WB shows on DVD, the Gilmore Girls seemed like a long time coming.  Now how long do we have to wait for the second season???

B0000524CY|5.0|Let's imagine it's Halloween. You sit down and put on a spooky film. Sure, some of you will choose Halloween or Scream, or maybe even Resident Evil.(?!?!) But the only movie that you should have to choose is The Exorcist, the most terrifying film of all time.<BR>The plot is fairly simple. An innocent girl is possessed by an ancient and foreboding demon, and as she turns into the demon himself, her only chance for salvation is through an exorcism. An intense film this is, not so much because of the demon, but because of the horrors that this little girl must endure to ensure her safety. She goes through INTENSE medical examinations, brutal self-inflicted wounds, and painful exorcisms, all to save her soul. The content of the film is bone-chilling, and it will make you think deeply about God and the soul of every human on earth. The most terrifying film of all time is now on DVD. Pray for your soul!

0743243307|3.0|I was excited to read this book when it was selected by my book club, but I found it disappointing.  Though Monica Ali is a talented writer who uses words beautifully to capture the mood, look, smell, and emotion of a scene, the book introduced too many concepts and themes that either went nowhere or that were wrapped up much too easily and conveniently.  Nazneen is an interesting character whose traditional upbringing and deep faith conflict with some of her life choices (such as her extra-marital affair with a much younger man), but I never felt that the author delved into how the character resolved or worked through those conflicts in any significant way.  I found myself bored by the last 100 pages, skimming through the conclusion only to find out what happened, but not really caring one way or the other.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|As it is gospel truth that every album the beatles did was a runaway 5 star masterpiece,it goes without saying that this,27 number 1 hits, is beyond fantastic... that is why,when this was released in november 2000,it went to number 1 in a record 34 countries,and has given yet more entries in guinness for the beatles!
6305252521|5.0|This film was brilliant in almost every regard. Jim Carrey's performance was incredibly believable. You saw his vulnerabilty and confusion toward the end. Ed Harris shows his love for Truman but his unwillingness to let Truman experience anything that would make him more human undermines what he's trying to do.<br />It also pointed out the flaws in the system, the main problem is that they made it too perfect and made it follow their own scripts instead of letting Truman discover these things for himself. They didn't allow him to have a legitimate and a real love interest and instead forced on him the relationship they wanted. But beyond that it shows the increasing voyeurism of the viewers.<br />The Truman Show shows us what television is like know, even though it was filmed in 1998. It's really a remarkable and prophetic view of what we would and will continue to be interested in on TV. From Christof's first speech: people tired of seeing fake emotions and special effects to when he says,&quot;We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented.&quot; We accept it as being reality, even though we latch on a little cynicism knowing that there is story editing, casted stereotypes, and &quot;confessionals.&quot; The &quot;reality&quot; is sucked out. Obviously, I'm not a fan of reality televison and all it creates. <br />Bravo Peter Weir, BRAVO! Thank You!!

B0001Z53CY|4.0|D12 has certainly showed their lyrical talent on this cd, it is a major improvement from devil's night since the content is not as violent and the material in d12 world is deeper. Songs like Good die young, 40 oz, get my gun, etc, you can clearly see the improvement the mebers of d12 made lyrically. I would recommend this cd. it will grow on you as you listen to it for the second or the third time
0688163173|5.0|What a superb story! It begins in a vague manner and stays like that with heavy references to the Second World War and past experiences in that conflict which ties in well with the main charactor and his objective in finding an escaped murderess.<br />Lots of previous reviewers have complained about it not being as good as Mystic River but maybe they are missing the essential point that Mr Lehane as the verstile writer that he is not stuck in a rut writing the same kind of novel. Please enjoy this wonderful novel and wait for Mr Lehane's next intriguing book.
B0001KZM3O|4.0|Certainly any attempt to follow up The Wall would be considered anti-climactic. Yes, the strain Waters &amp; Gilmore had during this recording would become evident as Waters composed this angry, cynical rant and dominates the album. Yet it moves as much today as when it first came out back in 1983 when the last reminants of Pink Floyd disintergrated (Sorry, Division Bell &amp; Lapse Of Reason don't count.). The question people will be asking is it worth forking out the extra cash to replace the old CD. That depends. Overall, I'd say yes. Not so much for the bonus track of  &quot;When The Tigers Broke Free&quot;, a nice but unecessary addition. It's for the remastering itself which gives the vocals, orchestra, and sound effects a new, brighter crispness in sound. Not a dramatic improvement per se, but it is noticable in a side by side comparrison where the original on Columbia/Sony does sound muddier. If you're the slightest bit interested, I think you'll find yourself picking this up and be quite satisfied.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|One of the most brilliant as well as funny movies i have seen in at least the last one year!I'm not a Tim Burtons fan but Big fish is one of my favourite movies of all times from now on.The story is great,the end is even better,the music is marvellous and the actors performances can not be put into words.Thanks everyone!

0761119752|5.0|Since he was 2 or 3 months old, my baby has loved to hear us chant this catchy rhyme. Keep a good, steady rhythm when you read it aloud, dance with it or pound the crib mattress to keep time, and it's magic. \\"Pajammy to the left! Pajammy to the right! Jamma jamma jamma jamma P!J!\\" seldom fails to get a baby grin. The pictures of happy dancing animals, like most of Boynton's illustrations, just radiate good feeling. This is too good to save for bedtime (in fact, it's so rousing, parents might prefer to use it earlier in the day).
B000148KK2|5.0|For all you jazz facists (or &quot;purists&quot;, as they like to call themselves) who have a problem with Diana Krall's &quot;The Girl In The Other Room&quot;, I have four words for you: Keep it to yourselves.  Who cares what you think???!!!  The rest of us out there in the real world see this album for the musical masterpiece that it is.  Where it is written that jazz artists have to do ONLY cover tunes???  It's about time somebody try to do something different, and Diana Krall is the person to do it.  I'm utterly astounded that she's managed to take music that was designed for blues (Stop This World - Track 1), country (Almost Blue - Track 4) or the regular pop world (Black Crow - Track 8) and transform them into kick ass jazz tunes.  And that's ... selling out???  PLUEEEZZE!!  This album has got to be some of the best stuff that Diana's ever put out.  At the end of the day, I got my money's worth, and I'll never understand how anybody couldn't feel that way.
0385504209|5.0|Author Dan Brown's controversial novel is a sleek, intriguing, engaging and factual(?) thrill ride of a novel.  Book  discussion about the novel among friends didn't focus on the story of a modern day quest for the Holy Grail (with clues of course in Leonardo Da Vinci's art work). The discussion focused on the concepts and theories that were raised in the novel. For me, the main characters and places serve as backdrop for the ideas being raised by the novel.<br />In the novel the reader is taken on a electrifying roller coaster ride.  From Leonardo Da Vinci's painted clues, pagan rituals, a true secret society (Opus Dei), modern day Knights, the relationship between Mary Magdalene and Jesus, the oppression and  fear of the Divine Feminine and even a eye-opening insight into Disney's images, this book will raise more than few eyebrows and makes the reader think.<br />I can only image the amount of research Mr. Brown had to do with this novel.  The author has done a breathtaking job of putting all the pieces of the puzzle together for you that will leave you in suspense, on the edge of your chair and in some cases up all night until the last page is turned.  I will definitely read more work by Mr. Brown, I simply can't get enough of his Art!s

But this is definitely more in his old style and definitely worth reading.  If you like &quot;old school&quot; Grisham, this one is worth a look.

B000002LR6|4.0|Released in 1992, just as the 1980's thrash metal scene was winding down, \\"Psalm 69\\" is a bridge-building album whose importance in shaping the history of extremity shouldn't be underestimated.  While bands like Meshuggah, Pig Destroyer, and Burnt by the Sun continue redefining what it means to be extreme, Ministry's industrial thrash sound still holds up extremely well as an example of sonic carnage in its most malevolent form.  Indeed, many of the songs on \\"Psalm 69\\" see Ministry expanding on traditional metal sounds to take heavy music into increasingly more visceral and nihilistic territory.  The guitars don't play riffs so much as churn out strangulated chunks of distortion, and they're backed by drum patterns heavy enough to scramble brains.  Practically making the likes of James Hetfield and Tom Araya sound like lounge singers, Al Jorgensen's abrasive vocals foreshadowed the ever-harsher intonations that would grace the metal genre in the '90's (and beyond).  But perhaps most importantly, the band's obvious destructive intentions are tempered by some of the most wildly infectious grooves in heavy-music history.  Yes, there's a lot of madness and mayhem to be found here, but weirdly enough there's a lot of fun as well, an element that's sadly missing in the nu-metal scene that has filled the airwaves over the past several years.  Sometimes, the album even manages to be a bit danceable.  The powerhouse opener \\"New World Order\\" is literally alarming, as the sound of sirens going off and George Bush's predictions of a new order provide the backdrop for the song's astringent guitar work and disgruntled vocals.  \\"TV II\\" was grindcore before it had a name, with high-speed flurries of instrumental fury alternating with Jorgensen's angry proclamations.  After a brief and rather cryptic intro, the surprisingly lighthearted \\"Jesus Built My Hotrod\\" takes off at a breakneck tempo, guest vocalist Gibby Haynes spitting out gibberish over a beat that will have you banging your head until your neck is stiff.  The title track is a rather disturbing mood piece that effectively mixes religious imagery, eerie atmospherics, and a few well-placed moments of hard-hitting aggression.  \\"Corrosion\\" could work very well as the soundtrack to a nightmare, layering Al's heavily distorted vocals over rhythms so thunderous they could make a house shake.  Closing things out is the ominous \\"Grace,\\" a three-minute piece of ambience that is much more subdued than most of the album but still manages to be genuinely creepy, due in no small part to the intimations of Armageddon that are sprinkled throughout.  You can still hear the influence of Ministry in some of the bands that have come after them: think White Zombie, Strapping Young Lad, Fear Factory, Static-X.  But you should never forget that Ministry were doing it first, loudest, and quite possibly best.ur head until your neck is stiff.

B0000DD7LB|4.0|P(...)I personally think this is Britney's best. She's not the best vocalist, I admit, but the beats and the hooks that this album provides are more than enough to make up for the lack of vocal power. It's an album that isn't made up of pop fluff, for she no longer is aiming for that audience. It's a dance album and a damned good one. Each singer has their own standard so why in God's name are people always trying to fit HER in another standard? <br />The lyrics in the songs are definitely far more mature than what you'd expect but there's a sort of innocent quality to it nonetheless. One gets the feeling she's no sex kitten, just imitating one.<br />Even though the albums sort of falls off at the end, it's a satisfying piece of work from Ms. Spears. 4 stars from me.
B0001L3MI0|5.0|I am writing this review in the face of a number of negative entries I found when looking through the reviews already posted. I found Independence Day to be a fun, visually exciting experience. A number of existing reviews picked apart the story line and made a big thing of the plot holes. SO WHAT? This was not a serious scientific presentation, but a chance to suspend belief and immerse one's self in a visual soup of big bang effects. Of course there were plot holes but did you actually think that a laptop would lay waste to an alien invasion? Windows can't even talk to MAC! How would a human written virus infect an alien system? To those who took such offense at the technical side and the plot issues.... lighten up!! By the way, almost every negative review was riddled with incorrect spelling and grammar. THAT should be negatively reviewed!
B000001Y2U|5.0|Marilyn Manson, the supposed antichrist (he really isn't) is one of the greatest industrial artists of the modern era.  What is it that makes his music so great, you may ask?  Is it the voice that hits you like any drug in the world?  Is it the simplistic, yet addictive, bass and guitar riffing, wrapped in an almost beautiful coat of drums and electronic effects?<br />No... that's just the icing on the cake.<br />What is it really that makes Marilyn Manson, one of the creepiest guys (to many, anyway) in thw world, so amazing?<BR>It's just Marilyn Manson.  That's the only thing that can be said.<br />Well, now that I have finished my probably over-the-top intro, let me do what I am here to do... review Antichrist Superstar.<BR>Despite its suggestive name, if you have any sort of self-control, Antichrist Superstar going to turn the children of the world into Satan-worshipping maniacs that want nothing more than to destroy the universe.  With that said, I will review.<br />The strong songs on the album are as follows:<BR>1. The Beautiful People - The addictive drum beat and the strong lyrics make this song powerful.  Manson's voice takes control in the song, especially during the chorus.<BR>2. Tourniquet - While the demonic whispering in the first two or so seconds of the song are a little creepy, the wailing guitar comes off strong, while Marilyn's voice grabs you when he yells the line &quot;Take your hatred out on me...&quot;<BR>3. Little Horn - The guitar riff of this song is really cool. The lyrics, all screamed, pound into your head.<BR>4. Mr. Superstar - A fun little song about obsession. The guitar starts off as commanding, but later the vocals take over, like usual.<BR>5. 1996 - The lyrics sound like Manson is protesting protesters, but the song straight-up kicks.<BR>6. Reflecting God - The all-around strongest song on the album.  The vocals in the chorus are Godly, no pun intended.<br />Overall, if you are a Manson fan, this is a must-have album.  If you areinterested in listening to Marilyn to check out his style, this is the one, my friends.<br />-E

I wouldn't say it was excellent to keep watching over and over again, but it was still a good film. The music at the end was sad too, can't remember how it goes but every time i hear it it makes you feel sad. He had known her and he was going to marry her until she found out that she had got cancer and then she died, Heartbreaking story.

I read it when I was a junior doctor and it made me give up my job.&quot;
B0001HAISQ|5.0|I originally saw this movie in theatres and i was blown away by the special effects and the music.  The cast is excellent and each plays their part to the fullest.  The sets look like they just popped out of a story book and the music is really an adventure in itself.  While Peter Pan is commonly known as being a story for children, this film adaptation really doesn't hold back on the darker aspects of the story.  The mermaids aren't the beautiful creatures we think of them as in stories but are instead red haired ,green skinned ,sharp toothed and feral in appearance.  The home underground is absolutely amazing and the forest is breath-taking.  I also love the fairies especially the scene where they are dancing.  This is one of the films most memorable and breath-taking scenes. The pirate ship and the sword fighting scenes are classic. The DVD includes behind the scenes footage of literally almost everything in the movie and there is also a very special deleted scene when Wendy grows up.  The actors are great with Jeremy Sumpter as Peter Pan, Rachel Hurd Wood as the beautiful Wendy and Jasson Isaacs in the dual role of Mr. Darling/Captain Hook.  Lynn redgrave is perfect in the role of the stuffy Aunt Milicent but still manages to have a certain loving quality at the same time.  Overall, this is a great movie and while being somewhat over-looked when compared to some recent family films, this version will go down in cinema history as being a spectacular tour de force for the child in everyone!!!!
0307155102|5.0|My son, who is now 40 years old, had this book when he was about 2 years old.  I used to read some of it every day to him, and we would laugh and talk about all of the pictures, and the words under each item.  Soon, he could look at all the pages and \\"read\\" the words.  I truly believe this book was the inspiration for his lifelong love of reading. Now, I buy this book for the grandchildren!
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|I hesitate to use superlatives to describe any film, but this film draws them out of me.  Tim Burton's distinct visual style is perfectly matched to the film's captivating blend of fantasy and reality.  Rather than recap the plot, which has been done in countless other reviews, I only point to the interesting conclusions of the other reviews.  I take it as a good sign when a movie can generate such different interpretations by people who enjoyed it equally.<br />But what puts it above other films that engage your mind is that it works as a story as well.  The best way to describe my experience is to say that it was like watching the Princess Bride for the first time (except now that I am older, the film is much more mature as well).  Overall, it is one of those rare films that is hard to imagine being better if something about it were changed.
B00008S2VG|4.0|Great artists always produce work that is relevant to their lives at the time.  Madonna is obviously in love but still wondering what it means, where it will lead and what her obligations are to her husband, children and her fans.  I find this an intriguing piece of work because it doesn't give you a sugar coated vision of commitment.  Although most of the lyrics are positive the music is moody and underscores what may really be going on - doubt, loss of self identity and the realization that more work is needed to maintain her relationships and her place in the world.<BR>Keep it up Madonna - I'll always be listening.
B00005B3Z6|5.0|There are moments in every episode where you think \\"Nothing on tv well ever be better than this\\" (that is before you see the next episode).<BR>The American version of Queer as folk is simply not comparable to this one. <BR>Every second of the UK version is worth watching.  Not every episode of the US version is worth watching. Thats the difference.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|By far one of the best movies I have seen in a while!  I would recommend owning this one.
0780622650|3.0|The classic tale of the Robinson family (Swiss Family Robinson) was moved to a science fiction setting on television.  That show is now a movie.  But some of the ideas have been lost from the original and this would better be called Swiss Family Dysfunctional.<br />The Robinson family is not a happy one and neither is Earth.  Pollution got out of hand and the planet is dying.  A new planet must be found.  The Robinsons are going to fly a ten-year mission to a distant planet and set up a warp gate that will allow easy colonization.  The world is depending upon them.<br />But there are those who are against the idea and want the plane for themselves.  They have hired Dr. Smith to sabotage the mission.  To keep things quiet, Smith is trapped on the doomed ship.  Well, the family manages to survive and goes through a series of harrowing adventures.  All the while their internal squabbles grow more and more heated.<br />In the end, they manage to rebuild their family but they have blown up a planet, committed genocide, and possible doomed the Earth.  But there is still something fascinating about this film.  Mimi Rogers has one of the best scenes when she takes on her husband (Hurt) and the pilot (le Blanc).<br />This can be an enjoyable film but if you are looking for a film rendition of a television show you loved, I think you will be a bit disappointed.
B0000VAFO0|3.0|What do you get when you throw vampires and werewolves into a goth-designed city, have some sudden unexplained love story, and then throw in some horrible plot holes and bad science?  Well, a mediocre movie for one thing.  I have some serious gripes with this movie, obviously, but first lets get to the story.<br />Vampires and werewolves have been fighting a war for as long as anyone can remember, in modern times, it basically translates to gang like battles over turf.  These battles feature a lot of matrix-like (more like matrix-copied) action sequences, and a whole lot of guns, guns equipped with magic sunlight bullets.  The main character is what's known as a death dealer, not sure what puts her above the rest of her clan, since they all seem quite capable of dealing death, but hey, the title is gothy and sounds cool, so we'll keep it. (see where I'm going?)<br />Okay, sounds kinda neat, kind of a supernatural Romeo and Juliet.  Except no, see, I actually cared a little bit about Romeo and Juliet, and I understood and sypathized with their character flaws.  But these characters, especially our heroine, should be above these things, but of course, you have to have the angsty I love you but shouldn't love you and now I'll betray my family story for unclear reasons.<br />Anyway, you get the idea.  You know what the scariest thing about this movie is?  That there are plans to make it into a trilogy.
B000001DTM|5.0|Reinvention is the Achilles Heel of rock music. So many have tried, very few have succeeded. When The Joshua Tree was released in 1987, it brought shot the already popular band into the stratosphere of rock history. The imagery of Bono as a rock messiah surrounded by a bleak desert limbo was hard to shake. The sense of seriousness that Bono brought to the stage was even harder. The subsequent release of Rattle & Hum only reinforced this image, along with delivering shots from many ignorant critics who saw U2 elevating themselves into rock demigods.<br />After the Lovetown tour of 1989 Bono announced that U2 was \\"going to go away and dream it all up again\\". Few bands would have survived U2's ride to the stratosphere intact, and many thought this may have been the end of U2....<br />Along comes reinvention:) Actually before Achtung Baby was released we had a sneak peek of U2's new sound in their dark & pulsating cover of Cole Porter's \\"Night and Day\\" on the Red, Hot & Blue AIDS benefit album. This was only a sampling of what was to come..<br />When the first single of Acthtung Baby, \\"The Fly\\", hit the air in late 1991, everyone was stunned, and few knew what to make of the new U2. Darkly nihilistic, erotic & chaotic, we were introduced to a band that had shed its earthy image, and emerged as something completely different.<br />Achtung Baby was released in November of 1991, and the ZOOTV tour was soon to follow. The album itself was a dark & hopeful journey through musical & lyrical styles crafted by musical genius.<br />\\"Zoo Station\\" drips with satirical irony. The curtain has opened, the circus has arrived, and we are in for quite a ride.<br />\\"Even Better Than The Real Thing\\" is pure sonic joy. We are further catapulted into U2's new circus of sound, and take a ride on the roller coaster of sound that is taking us places we thought music could never go.<br />\\"One\\" brings us to a screeching halt, but instead of being annoyed at the interruption, we are treated to a very poignant and concise piece of music that is one of the greatest ballads ever written. Bono's lyrics on this track are a masterpiece.<br />Lest we forget about our little sonic coaster, \\"Until The End Of The World\\" breaks us out of our stupor, and back into the heavens. \\"Dark, Sexy & Very Cool\\", this track is also a lyrical and musical masterpiece.<br />\\"Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses\\" keeps our journey going without slowing down.<br />Then we have \\"So Cruel\\", our second \\"Ballad\\" on the album. Evoking a sense of loss and betrayal, we end up feeling a bit of hope at the end of this track. Add two cups of irony with a twist of redemption and you have one unique and very touching song.<br />\\"The Fly\\"... \\"EVERYTHING YOU KNOW IS WRONG\\" is the essence of this track. The first single is also IMO the best track on an album filled with some of the greatest tracks ever written. Again chaos reigns, and the band is in top form. Those that saw the video of The Fly before hearing the single on the radio will always see this song as the essence of the \\"New U2\\", Fly shades and all.<br />\\"Mysterious Ways\\" follows, and brings our journey to the streets of Morocco and beyond. Again a masterpiece of lyrics & music, it presents a departure from the chaotic & forlorn journey the album has taken us on thus far, and brings yet another classic to the fore.<br />\\"Tryin' To Throw You Arms Around The World\\" and \\"Ultraviolet\\" are the two \\"Happy Melancholy\\" songs on the album. While both are quite different in their approach, they both leave you feeling happily content. \\"Ultraviolet\\" is also a favorite track of mine, with Edge, Adam & Larry's \\"Helicopter\\" guitar & rhythm section sound a sonic imprint.<br />\\"Acrobat\\" is yet another excellent track. Angry & Bleak, it keeps with the sense of hope wrapped up in sonic chaos that pervades the album.<br />We close with the very tender and down tempo \\"Love Is Blindness\\". A perfect close as we come down from our roller coaster ride feeling quite sated.<br />Achtung Baby has gone down in rock music history as one of the greatest albums ever written, and deservedly so. U2 reinvented themselves to such a huge degree that any other band trying the same path would have fallen flat. In an age where hair rock was freshly buried in the ground, and grunge was starting its fast rise to the mainstream of rock, U2 took the nihilism & angst so prevalent in the early 90's, added a touch of irony, a bit of honey, and a lot of hope, and stirred it up until a musical masterpiece emerged.<br />One of the \\"Must Own\\" albums in rock history, and with good reason.sated.<br />Achtung Baby has gone down in rock music history as one of the greatest albums ever written, and deservedly so.

B000089RVX|5.0|There are so many rock bands today that don't have what can be considered &quot;good music.&quot; More often than not, some guy is singing (if you'll call it singing, to me it's yelling) about cutting his wrists or being depressed. Evanescence is a rarity for me- music that I actually like. Albums usually have 3 or 4 great songs surrounded by filler. I bought this CD and took it home to hear immediately. There is no filler to find here. Each song is great. &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; may be a bit overplayed, but it's still a great song. I love the music here. It all blends together so well. And thankfully, the lead singer Amy Lee has the voice and talent to back up the music she sings with. If you want great music, buy this CD. I never really even listen to music, and now I love this album. I want to find &quot;Origin&quot; their first album, but it's pretty hard to find. But I'm definitely getting their next CD. And unlike the processed corporate swill we see a lot today, the songs were actually written by members of the group. That's a rare thing in music today!
B0000541AM|5.0|A classic 1979 film is finally on DVD. But as usual, Paramount pictures decides to ruin a DVD with no features except the trailers. That really makes me mad, I almost gave this 4 stars but the movie still covers it. This film was based on the novel by Sol Yurick. There is really not much story to this film. There is just dozens and dozens of memorable quotes like &quot;Warriors, come out and play-yaa&quot;. This film just shows the massive destruction of gangs. How gangs react, and the rules of being a gang member. How each gang has their own territory. <br />This film has been known by it massive destruction of chaos, proving anarchy did once exist. By its brutal battles and cinematography. For a film with not much of a plot, only the fact that this shows the life of a gang member, this is a great film. Performances are really great too. A must see film if you love action.
B00005JMCN|4.0|Already one of the best horse-racing epics in film history (for a change, see &quot;A Day At The Races&quot; comedy by Marx Brothers), &quot;Seabiscuit&quot; does not break any new ground, but is a solid, flawlessly produced and at times completely enthralling movie, adapted from a successful book.<br />The thrills come (as one might well guess) from the races the small underdog horse named Seabiscuit won in the 1930's, giving the Depression-stricken Americans something to cheer about. The movie needs a while to really get started and thus is just a little bit long, but eventually the overall craft sported by filmmakers redeems itself as truly impressive; no wonder the movie got seven Oscar nominations, although it converted none.<br />Rock-solid male cast is of a real class -- Jeff Bridges, Chris Cooper, Tobey Maguire and William H. Macy shining in a minor role -- while Elizabeth Banks (as Bridges' second wife Marcela Howard) gets a sound amount of coverage in a film with few female roles. The movie wisely eschews some cliches -- for example, after the jockey Red Pollard (Maguire) is forced to say good-bye to his parents as a youth we never see the mom and dad again, although this might ensure a real tear-jerking reunion. Instead, &quot;Seabiscuit&quot; is from the beginning to end an assured, safe and almost guaranteed entertainment for all.
B00006M183|5.0|Everybody loves to rip this album.  I don't understand why.  I think it rocks and I've been listening to Pearl Jam since August 27, 1991. (check out that date!)  Much in the same vein as the experimental sides of Vitalogy and No Code, Riot Act offers up some of the best work from Pearl Jam since the earlier days.  In my opinion, they continue to mature as a band, and that includes their songwriting.  Songs like &quot;Cropduster&quot;, &quot;Can't Keep&quot;, &quot;Green Disease&quot;, &quot;1/2 Full&quot; and &quot;All or None&quot; are all on my list for best songwriting from the band.  Don't judge this album too quickly.  Let it grow on you.  If you still have a hard time catching the vibe, order Pearl Jam's DVD live at the Showbox from their website.  This live show, where they showcased a lot of the new songs from Riot Act before their 2003 tour, will help you realize how much this album, and this band, rock!
6302799066|5.0|Dr. Strangelove, Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb is one of the most biting and hard-hitting commentaries about the U.S.-Soviet arms race, overdependence on technology, the can-do philosophy of the Air Force, and the sheer lunacy of MAD, the apt acronym for the term Mutual Assured Destruction -- which was the Cold War diplo-speak that meant &quot;you nuke our country, we'll nuke yours.&quot;<br />Normally one wouldn't think the possibility of nuclear annihilation would be the wellspring for a comedy, just as most people today wouldn't think the Holocaust is fodder for satire.  Yet when Stanley Kubrick set out to do a straightforward dramatic film based on novelist Peter George's &quot;Red Alert,&quot; a novel about an &quot;accidental&quot; nuclear attack on the Soviet Union by the United States, the more research and contemplation the director and co-screenwriter did on the subject of nuclear deterrence and all the nitty gritty of nuclear warfare, the more insane the whole theme seemed.  So Kubrick -- no doubt aware that a similarly themed film (Fail-Safe) was underway -- gave in to his impulses and switched gears from drama to &quot;dark&quot; comedy.<br />Kubrick sets the tone right from the main title sequence.  As the credits (and you have to see these yourself) roll, we see footage of a B-52 Stratofortress being refueled by a KC-135A aerial tanker.  In the background, the very romantic strains of &quot;Try a Little Tenderness&quot; gives this aerial ballet an almost grotesque ironic counterpoint.  Love music? In a scene depicting a nuclear bomber being refueled as it heads toward its fail-safe point?<br />Things get going, though, when Royal Air Force liaison officer Group Capt. Lionel Mandrake (Peter Sellers) gets an unexpected phone call from Burpleson AFB's  B-52 wing commander, Gen. Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden), ordering to impound all privately owned radios and to order the B-52s already on deterrence patrol to leave their fail-safe points and to implement Wing Attack Plan R.  Befuddled but obedient, Mandrake complies, setting off Gen. Ripper's plan to launch an unauthorized attack against the Soviet Union.<br />Dr. Strangelove follows three story threads, each getting loopier as the world hurtles closer and closer to annihilation:<br />First, there is hapless Group Capt. Mandrake's reaction to his discovery of Ripper's real plot and the loony logic of the general's motives.  The Soviet Union hasn't started a war, Ripper says, but has been messing around with Americans' natural fluids since 1946 -- the same year fluoridation began to be implemented in earnest.<br />Second, there is President Merkin Muffley's (Peter Sellers again) stunned reaction when he is summoned to the Pentagon's War Room along with the Soviet ambassador, where his increasingly pathetic attempts to defuse the crisis run into various stumbling blocks, including the hawkish demeanor of Air Force General Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott), the dissembling of the ambassador (Peter Bul), the vagaries of long distance telephone service, the bizarre machinations of one of his senior advisors, Dr. Strangelove (Peter Sellers yet again), and the inebriated state of the Soviet Premier.<br />Third, there is the sheer pluck of Air Force Maj. T.J. Kong(  Slim Pickens), who, upon getting the orders to implement Wing Attack Plan R, doffs his flight helmet and puts on a cowboy hat, peppering his orders and pep talk with slangy cowboy terms.  He, too, is a bit loony, yet he and his crew (which includes James Earl Jones in his first film appearance) overcome every obstacle thrown at them on their way to their target.<br />Kubrick peppers his film with sight gags (nuclear bombs with Dear John and Hi There! stenciled on their warheads, a buffet counter in the war room) and punny names (Keenan Wynn's paratrooper character, one who fears retribution from the Coca-Cola company more than the prospect of an unstopped nuclear war, is named Bat Guano),and his use of music in an ironic counterpoint to the visuals (&quot;Try a Little Tenderness&quot; in the aforementioned title sequence, a hummed rendition of &quot;When Johnny Comes Marching Home&quot; over Major Kong's toe-to-toe with the Rooskies speech, and Vera Lynn's famous rendition of &quot;We'll Meet Again&quot; as the crisis comes to a stark close) puts an end to the misconception of the director as being cold and unfunny.and his use of music in an ironic counterpoint to the visuals (&quot;Try a Little Tenderness&quot; in the aforementioned title sequence, a hummed rendition of &quot;When Johnny Comes Marching Home&quot; over Major Kong's toe-to-toe with the Rooskies speech, and Vera Lynn's famous rendition of &quot;We'll Meet Again&quot; as the crisis comes to a stark close) puts an end to the misconception of the director as being cold and unfunny.
B0001DI0FI|2.0|First of all, I will get my bias out of the way and say I haven't seen that many \\"sea\\" movies that I have liked. So when I saw this one, and came to realize that it is more about the relationship of two characters, Russel Crowe (Captain) and Paul Bettany (ship's surgeon,) then I realized I just did not like it. Now this one isn't a creative mental movie like Crowe's earlier part was in A Beautiful Mind, and it lacked the action in Gladiator. Those aspects gave the other movies the acclaim that they received. This one however leaves fighting as a tie-in to all the events going on in their busy personal lives, raise sail here, swab deck there. Give it a chance; because open-minded is better than close-minded, still I felt personally disappointed by the movie more than anything.
0671015206|4.0|For many years, since I got my first job, I thought I was never get out of debt(Student Debt) if I couldn't get a higher income job. But I was wrong, as I got better paid jobs I got bigger debt, then I found the answer, in part thanks to this book. The rule is fiscal discipline, never spend more than your paycheck and always have a savings goal.
0312995423|2.0|There are many, many problems with this book.  So many, in fact, that I can't recommend you spend time reading the book.  Here is my list:<br />* The technical facts are just plain wrong in many places.  They are so wrong, in fact, that if you are a software engineer by trade, you may be insulted.  The details about cryptography, security, etc., read like they were written by someone who is a technical illiterate.<br />* The plot is embarrassingly thin and predicable.  Sure, there are a few twists and surprises, as youw would expect in a DB book, but overall, I guessed every major plot move before it happened.  Very different from past books.<br />* The characters aren't developed to any extent.  They are two-dimensional with ridiculous sounding names and cardboard personalities.  They make the book read like a made-for-TV movie.<br />DB can and has done better work than this.  Here's hoping that he returns to his prior form.  I'm sorry, but I can't recommend this one.
B00005JLWN|2.0|This is a decent movie with some serious problems.  It doesn't bother me so much that it is quite derivative of a number of sources; that's not uncommon in the science fiction genre.  Instead, I was really bothered by two serious flaws.<br />First, the exposition is so thick you'd think that Basil Exposition from Austin Powers is a resident of Libria.  We get title cards and narration at the opening of the movie to explain the basic concepts, which is never a good sign.  Then, 10 minutes later, they tell us all of the same stuff all over again in the context of the movie!  I suspect that the redundant explanation at the beginning was tacked on as a result of testing.  Nevertheless, telling us exactly the same stuff, and a lot of it, twice in ten minutes is boring.  On top of that, some very important exposition (i.e., the fact that Bale is the very top Grammaton Cleric, the best there is) is thrown away so quick that if you cough you'll miss it.<br />Second, the very point of Librian society is that no one feels emotion, and thus there is no war or crime.  Yet, people express emotion all the time in this film.  We notice it first with Taye Diggs, who is supposed to be a Grammaton Cleric with total emotional control, who nevertheless laughs, smiles, and seems to be quite the emotional guy.  Then the Party higher-up shows a lot of emotion, but I could buy that at least, because leaders traditionally do not have to obey the rules they set forth for others.  So, the movie violates its internal logic from the get-go, with Diggs emoting away and making the viewer scratch his head about what's happening.  This is not Diggs' fault.  On one of the extras, the writer/director explains that he let the actors show emotion, because a movie about emotionless zombies would be boring.  That is an amazing admission about your movie, to state that showing its actual premise on screen would be boring, and thus you have to cheat on it in order to make a decent movie.  Wow.  I would refer him to THX-1138 as a counterexample, but what do I know?<br />So, this movie is kneecapped by its own writer and director.  Great.  In other respects, it's very good; the actors do a fine job, the fight choreography is excellent, and the technical aspects are nothing but professional high-end stuff.<br />The Gun Kata stuff is goofy but very well done, and I was happy to suspend my disbelief because it looked so cool.  I did have to laugh when it was introduced as Gun Kata, though, because all I could think of was the classic Gymkata with Kurt Thomas, which about as far from looking cool as you can get.<br />It's too bad the director didn't cut about 20 minutes out of this, tighten up the script, and stay true to his vision.er him to THX-1138 as a counterexample, but what do I know?<br />So, this movie is kneecapped by its own writer and director.

0345451325|5.0|Halo: The Fall of Reach is a great book. I had kidded with my friends about reading this book for a few years and finally the temptation got to me and I bought it. I am thouroughly pleased with myself in this decision. I loved reading every bit of this book. It is fast paced but it has enough detail to create the scene and characters but not too much to weigh it down. And then, there's the action. I loved the way he described the massive space battles, ground battles, the new covenant races, and the idea of slipspace. He adds enough imformation and new technology to make it feel like its way in the future but explains it so some one from our time and understand it. I gave this book five stars because it is exciting and I couldn't put it down (literally, I read it during school in my classes and every once in a while some of them would ask me what the MC and Cortana were up to now and I would enjoy updating them on this exploit that had occured before Halo the game) but it is not on par with other sci-fi fantasy like Lord of the Rings, His Dark Materials, or Dune it is only a fun book to read. I'm right now almost done with the third book in this series which so far is better than the first in my opinion and has me really excited as to what the MC and Cortana are up to next.<br />P.S. I am a senior in Highschool and about to graduate. I guess I'll never grow up.
0767830555|5.0|As I watched Taxi Driver for the first time in twenty-odd years, I was reminded of M. Night Shyamalan's Unbreakable.  Not because Unbreakable comes anywhere close to Taxi Driver in terms of cinematic merit, but because Taxi Driver seemed to be aiming at the same broad theme--a comic book-style hero in a gritty, adult world. Because, if anything, Travis Bickle seems to fit quite closely a real world Batman, enraged by the injustices of the world, unable to fit in, and ultimately taking the law into his own hands.  He has a raw honesty--in sizing up people, in not being offended by a porn movie--and an uncontrollable urge to act on a primal sense of right and wrong.<br />Clearly, Travis is also more complex--and more disturbed--than the average comic book hero.  After all, Scorcese is aiming for real life (as to which Unbreakable is a pale, upper-middle-class imitation), and Travis' own, flat reaction to his apparent \\"psychosis\\" (his lamentations about having \\"these thoughts\\" was particularly impressive) betray a condition that at least fits our preconceived notions of what it means to be mentally \\"ill.\\"  But, unlike so many \\"sane\\" people, Travis does the unthinkable--he speaks to people honestly and openly, he gets enraged by injustice and immorality (no one else in the movie seems to care very much about 12 year old prostitutes), he has a nobility about himself (not giving in to sexual temptation from Jodie Foster's character).  And his apparent planning to attack a presidential candidate (the movie is never really clear as to whether he intends to harm the man, or even scare him) seems driven by the falsity of the candidate's message--his \\"we are the people\\" mantra echoing in a world where the common people (at least those encountered by Travis) are the last ones you'd want running things.<br />The ending is fascinating.  Is it real or a fantasy?  The clippings of newspaper articles, as the camera scans across the board, say Travis is dead, and then later that he is comatose, but recovering.  I suspect that the ending is a dream, the hallucination of a dying man who has his nobility vindicated in the end by appreciative parents and a city that needs more men like him.s comatose, but recovering.

B000002GYR|5.0|If I had to choose an album that changed my life and the way I listen and play it's Closing Time.  <br />Here are some of the album's highlights:<BR>Ol' 55's laid back country charm is now a classic.  The backing vocals are memorable and the piano arrangement is simple yet brilliant.  <br />I Hope that I Don't Fall in Love with You strikes you as a simple ballad at first.  Then it becomes a part of you.  The guitar arrangements and that beautiful lyrical pause: &quot;Now it's closing tiiiiime...... the music's fading out&quot; is perfect.<br />The bluesy Virginia Avenue with its muted trumpet is gorgeous.  It foreshadows future masterpieces such as Fumblin' with the Blues and Invitation to the Blues.  <br />Midnight Lullaby has the same Virginia Avenue feel.  Great trumpet arrangements and closes out with a great &quot;lullabying&quot; piano.  <br />Martha is one of the highlights of the album.  The opening lines are full of melancholy and beautiful melodies.  Then comes the change of tempo with the &quot;weeping&quot; strings and Tom's penetrating voice.  Amazing.<br />Grapefruit Moon has to be one of the greatest songs of all time.  Something truly &quot;breaks inside&quot;.<br />And the closing instrumental Closing Time is the perfect finisher.  One of the great masterpieces of the 20th century.

0618001905|4.0|King Leopold-this is a story that deserved to be told but wasn't. It was one of the biggest and one of the cruelest colonial regimes in Africa. It is a story of manipulation, drama, brutal murders, corruption, and immorality. In my opinion, King Leopold of Belgium is one of history's most notorious characters. Due to Leopold being the heir to the throne, as a child he was drawn towards wealth and indulgence. Greed drove him. Even into his adulthood, greed and self-indulgence were the traits that surfaced when he realized through gaining colonies he could continue to accumulate his riches. He positioned himself as a concerned leader of the people who wanted to combat the Arab slave trade that pervaded Africa. In the public eye, he was seen as a humanitarian, but the real facts didn't support that popular opinion and contradicted his image. Leopold used unethical methods to acquire his land. He ordered his men to force the natives, the Congolese, into manual labor. His inhumane treatment of them was characterized by killings, whippings, destruction of crops and local villages, and taking, as hostages, the wives and children for those who resisted or didn't produce enough rubber or ivory for the day. According to the author, Adam Hochschild, there was an estimated ten million Congolese deaths during Leopold's colonization process. (That sounds familiar.) Sadly, King Leopold's name isn't mentioned with the Hitlers and the Stalins of world history in the classrooms, as it rightfully should be. As people during that time started to find out the truth, Leopold resorted to cover-ups, lawsuits and bribery. In my opinion, Hochschild has done a fantastic job telling a story that most haven't heard to enable them to understand the outcome and, more importantly, the motives behind it.

1565123875|5.0|\\"Purple Hibiscus\\" is the debut novel from Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie.  It is the story of Kambili and her family.  Kambili's father is a powerful force both at home and in the family.  He holds fast to his Catholicism he views anyone who does not follow Christ as firmly as he does as a sinner and doomed to a fiery eternity.  He is not simply the father, but the ruler of the household.  Kambili's father sets a daily schedule for Kambili and her brother, Jaja, that they must follow to the minute and they are commanded to be the best students in their school.  While Jaja has a strength to his character, Kambili is meek and has the sense of being emotionally beaten down, though she has a strong narration throughout the novel.<br />The novel is set in Nigeria and it begins on Palm Sunday with a fight within the family.  Jaja is disobedient to his father and this seems like the beginning where cracks start appearing in the family, but Kambili tells us that the true beginning of this story happens earlier than this.  The second section of the novel is \\"before Palm Sunday\\" and is set an uncertain amount of time before Palm Sunday (at least, I didn't figure out exactly what the timeframe was).  This section traces Kambili's family and extended family as it leads up the Palm Sunday event, and we learn that the fight was not really a beginning, but an ending, that the fight was the result of all of the time before and the changes that were made in Kambili and Jaja, and by extension - to the family.  Section Three is \\"After Palm Sunday\\" and we see the ramifications of that fight and at this point it feels inevitable what happens next.<br />This is a strong, powerful novel, and even though it is set in a location that I have no knowledge of, it is really a novel about a family and a 15 year old girl.  Some things are universal, despite cultural differences.  This story of Kambili and her family is one such thing.  If you put the characters in a different setting (rural America, perhaps), the same story could play out with only a few differences.  This is the power of the story, that knowing nothing of Nigeria, we can understand the story Adichie is spinning., perhaps), the same story could play out with only a few differences.  This is the power of the story, that knowing nothing of Nigeria, we can understand the story Adichie is spinning.
6301954947|5.0|I first saw \\"Waterloo\\" on television back when I was a kid growing up in the mid 70's. Ever since that first viewing, I was forever fascinated by what I remembered seeing.<br />Finally - after a long search to locate this OOP movie - I found a copy several years ago on VHS from a \\"movie archive house\\" on the west coast. Recently, I purchased a duped DVD on eBay, as the only region it is available on at this time is region 2 and PAL.<br />This is one fo the best historical war epics of all time. Plummer and Stieger are superb in their roles as Wellington and Napolean, respectively... and, the aerial shots of the British squares under attack by French cavalry, alone, earn this movie 5 stars from me.<br />What I detect, unfortunately, from the edited version (which is the only version I know of available on any format right now) is, well... that it has been edited!!!<br />There are far too many choppy transitions between scenes, and their are characters and sub-plots that seem tossed into the mix without any apparent reason. I have to believe that there was more time devoted to such major scenarios as the fighting in and around Hougoumont...... I have to believe that there IS a scene - somewhere - showing the circumstances of why Wellington sent his best troops to the complex, and the importance surrounding this sector of the battle. How can the story of the battle for Hougoumont be complete without the closing of the North Gate by the heroic band of Coldstream Guards? In the edited version, we are only shown teasing glimpses - in a fast-forwarded timeline - of fighting in and around the farm complex that was such a vital part of the battlefield. La Haiye Sainte is also breezed over in the edited version. <br />What we get with the edited version is a movie consisting of some of the grandest and breath-taking battle scenes. But the FILM - as presented at this time - is disjointed and incomplete as a whole. \\"Gettysburg\\" is a long movie (could hjave been longer, still!).... \\"Waterloo\\" needs the same running time to be a complete film.<br />What is called for - and it is high time we see it happen - is the un-edited, original \\"Director's cut\\" version on DVD. But not only on DVD - region 1 DVD!
B00005JMCW|5.0|This film really struck a chord with me! I've been where Lindsay Lohan's character was with her on-screen mum, Jamie Lee Curtis. Tell me a teenage daughter who hasn't slammed her bedroom door in protest (and had it removed), yelled at her little brother, not liked her soon to be step-dad, not got on a motorbike because her mother wouldn't have liked it, turns her music up loud, belongs to a rock group, yet pierces her bellybutton without her mother's knowledge.<br />After watching this, I was on such a high afterwards. I loved the music (I'm getting into that loud music phase now, after my years of cheesy pop, so much so, that my mum had to go upstairs when I was watching this, due to the noise!), Jamie Lee Curtis &amp; Lindsay Lohan actually COULD have been mother and daughter (great casting), and on the whole, the movie was great.<br />I haven't watched a 'Walt Disney movie' since I was young, so watching this, and now actually owning a non-ANIMATION (it's called a cartoon) movie by them is great.<br />When Anna and Tess swap minds almost it's so funny! And what happens afterwards, made me appreciate my mum even more - although she hasn't had to put up with me smoking, drinking on street corners, and sleeping with any guy who takes an interest. At least that's something! Unfortunately, I couldn't persuade her to watch this. She doesn't know what's good for her. The way Jamie Lee Curtis manages to change her image - or the way Anna changes her mother's image - is amazing, although I preferred her with the slightly longer hair.<br />The extras are your average, run of the mill DVD extras to be honest. You get a &quot;backstage pass&quot; with Lindsay Lohan, which is quite funny, and you get to see the rehearsals that 'Pink Slip' do. There's also one deleted scene, a blooper reel, and some alternate endings, which are basically all the same!!!<br />A terrific movie for mothers &amp; daughters to watch together, or for others to have an insight into this lovely and sometimes troublesome relationship.<br />And on a final note: what is the point in putting easter eggs on DVDs if the person trying to find them isn't smart enough?!ometimes troublesome relationship.<br />And on a final note: what is the point in putting easter eggs on DVDs if the person trying to find them isn't smart enough?!
B00001ODGR|5.0|i had the chance to see styx perform this concert in canandaigua new york. i also saw them in concert back in the early 80s too (but i was way to inebriated to remember any of it).<BR>everything on this dvd was exactly how it was done when i saw them in canandaigua. the performance is powerful, the lighting is excellent and the audio is great. i own Grado headphones and its like sitting in the best seat of the house. its amazing these guys can still make live music sound like cd quality.
B0001DI0FI|1.0|This movie should not have gotten the credit that it did.  it may have had good art direction and costume designs but that does not make a good movie.  Master and Commander was filled with a boaring plot, very few and very dull battle sequences, and scene after scene at the dinner table that make doing bifunctional equations seem interesting.  Watching this movie was probably the worst thing I have done all year, including cutting off my own legs and beating myself with them.(...)
B000063DGC|4.0|One can only wonder what Ozzy thinks of this album now that the whole world knows the late Mr. Rhoads was having an affair with his wife at the time.  Sure, has nothing to do with the music; but you do wonder.<br />Of course, maybe Ozzy didn't mind so much as Randy Rhoads was responsible as much as anyone for reviving Ozzy's career.  Recorded after Osbourne had Blizzard of Ozz and Diary Of A Madman under his belt, Tribute features the amazing playing of Rhoads as much as it showcases Ozzy's singing.<br />The CD opens with a furious \\"I Don't Know\\" and \\"Crazy Train\\".  The CD then proceeds to display the solo song catalogue Ozzy had built up to that time.  Small that catalogue may be but it does contain some of the strongest material Osbourne ever wrote.<br />Half way through the CD Ozzy reverts to three Black Sabbath songs and then returns to his solo material.<br />The CD ends with a rather faltering practice session Rhoads recorded.  Musically it is totally worthless.  Its point may be that as talented as Rhoades was he really had to work painfully hard to develop his craft.<br />As this CD proves, Ozzy's loss of Rhoades was a disaster for his career.  Ozzy recovered but one is only left to wonder what could have been if Rhoades simply did not get on that plane for a joyride that day.  (Part of the mystery is Rhoades was deathly afraid of flying.  Getting on that plane was out of character for him.)  I simply have not heard Ozzy better live than on this CD.
B00003CXTG|5.0|I don't know why I've avoided this film for so long. It was probably mainly to do with the oh-so-bad reviews I kept reading, and people telling me (complete with &quot;oh man&quot; littered throughout) that it was diabolical, historically inaccurate, ya-de-ya-de-yah. I've seen the DVD many times, picked it up, and then put it back down (I've got a reputation to uphold here, y'know). And then on a bank holiday, it had its terrestrial premier on UK TV. So I thought what the hell, I'll give it a whirl, and then see what all the fuss is about, and most likely give it a bad review.<br />Boy, was I wrong.<br />I've seen reviews that have said it's too slow, it takes an hour before it gets into the real swing of things, blah blah blah. Well, I'm sorry, but I was hooked from the beginning. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen, and was dreading the phone ringing, or the 20-minute break halfway through for the news.<br />And in my opinion, everyone that has watched this, and given it a bad review, has a heart of stone. OK, so it has a few corny lines, but tell me a film that doesn't. The whole romance thing is cheesy and predictable (what guy is honestly going to touch his best friend's girl?) but I'm an old romantic at heart, and most of the scenes between Kate Beckinsale  &amp; Ben Affleck had me going practically giddy. (Kate Beckinsale  and Josh Hartnett just didn't seem right)<br />Ben Affleck is so cute in this! And Kate Beckinsale  is absolutely gorgeous too, but I'm not that way inclined. And for once, it wasn't the uniform that was making me go weak at the knees, it was just Ben Affleck before J-Lo, just being himself.<br />This is the second Michael Bay movie that I've seen that has made me cry buckets! I was welling up throughout, but by the end, the gates opened, and the tears wouldn't stop. And I thought I was bad enough at Armageddon! (&quot;Bruce Willis is gonna die! WAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!&quot; And then someone has the nerve to tell me that &quot;it's only a film&quot;. My eye it's only a film!) I'm glad I didn't see this movie in the cinema - cos I did with Armageddon, and that was highly embarrassing.<br />OK, I did notice some historical inaccuracies in this, not that I was looking out for them you understand, but there are some glaringly obvious stupid things. It's the 40s right? Have they never heard of contraception? It was practically a sin if you were unmarried and had a child in the 60s, you would have been burnt at the stake and sent to dance with the devil for this! And four months passes, but still no pregnancy bump? On someone as skinny as Kate Beckinsale 's character, there would definitely be a bump! And Rafe has dyslexia, but he writes pages and pages to Evelyn? Not possible, and probably not legible.<br />There are some fairly cheesy lines - obviously Michael Bay was reading some Mills &amp; Boon before doing this movie. Some of these include: &quot;When I get cold, the one place I can go to be warm is to think of you&quot;; &quot;I'm going to give my whole heart to Danny, but I don't think I'll ever look at another sunset without thinking of you&quot; and for some major eye rolling: &quot;I love you, and I'll have your baby, only I love him more, and you have to accept that in spite of my loving you forever while he'll always be my true love..&quot; Even I'm not that much of a romantic.<br />This film was visually stunning. The action scenes were incredible, and absolutely breathtaking. But there were some sad moments amongst all the action scenes - the saddest being Ben Affleck &amp; Josh Hartnett's characters holding the hands of the drowning on the Arizona.<br />However, I did feel that Michael Bay watched Armageddon &amp; Titanic a little too many times while making this film. There are many scenes very reminiscent of both movies. For example, Kate Beckinsale  could pass for Liv Tyler, especially in some of the final scenes, when she's there to meet her loved one off the plane. And the scenes actually in Pearl Harbour? Lots of people jumping ship, hitting propellor blades - remind you of anything? There's also planes flying overhead when the guys are walking towards their planes - a scene like the one in Armageddon, when they're all going to go away into space.<br />The score is very reminiscent of Armageddon too, and was very sad and tugged at the heartstrings. Some simple scores can set me off, and along with Armageddon, Anne of Green Gables, and a couple of other scores that people keep playing me, this score will be amongst them.<br />This is THE movie to have in your collection. It's going to quite happily join my collection of 'bad' movies as soon as I can get my hands on it. And it's up there in my list of great movies, along with Armageddon, Titanic, and probably some others too.scenes actually in Pearl Harbour?

B00003CXPJ|5.0|Best comedy ever.  Classic movie with classic moments in every scene.  Yeah, it's corney, but that's what it's trying to be.  If you start watching the movie knowing this, you'll love every scene.<br />Obey my dog!
0375414053|4.0|I didn't want to like this book.  In fact, I didn't when I first read it.  However, when I got into it, I couldn't keep from giggling.  While Kate is far busier (and crazier) than most working moms I know, most of us can find some aspect of her life to relate to.  I was clueless about many of the \\"British\\" things, but, then, the book wasn't written for me and there were universal Mommyisms to get past any language barrier.  This book won't change your life and it won't win the Nobel Peace Prize...but it is a good read.  Think of Bridget Jones after she gets a husband and kids.
B00000295Y|5.0|If you bought one hip hop cd, then Black Sunday is the one to get.  The beats are tight and B Real and Sen are in top form.  These guys are pioneers, innovators, etc.  Muggs lays down the tracks and B and Sen are the 2 man wrecking crew.  Forget all the flossin' and slick image hoz you see on Mtv, this is the real thing.  These guys are the hardest crew out there, and this cd is off the chizzle, yo.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I never watched this show when it was on - and now I'm glad, because my outrage at its cancellation would probably have driven me to violence. When I bought the DVD, I knew I'd only get 14 episodes, but it was still incredibly frustrating to get to the end and realize just how prematurely this show was axed. It's the kind of TV that really gets its hooks into you; my roommates (of both genders) became just as obsessed as I did. The characters are really great, three dimensional, entertaining and charismatic, and Firefly's premise really allows it to explore some interesting themes and ideas. The series could have gone to some (even more) fascinating places if it had been given time. And the fact that many of these actors are extremely attractive?... Just a nice bonus. Anyway, this show is great and I'll be first in line to see the movie. In the meantime, when friends ask to borrow the DVD set, I tell them to put it down and back the hell away from it, slowly, because I'm not letting it leave my apartment.
B000002C1V|5.0|Notice how some people love this album, others hate it.  Those of us who love it, know that it is a very meaningful album - on many dimensions.  There is so much to appreciate in this album, in this sense.    This is the only album I have where the artist actually communicates to me.  Literally.  Roger Waters was sending a message, and I got it.  Apparently I am not alone here.    But it is not a psychedelic album as were the ones prior.  This is probably why many people have hurt expectations after listening to it.
B00006CXXU|4.0|1. Stripped (Intro) - Introduction to the CD. Good beat; could have been turned into a real song. [N/A]<br />2. Can't Hold Us Down - I did not like this song the first time I heard it, but it quickly grows on you. This is one of my favorite songs on the album, lyrically and musically. Lil' Kim doesn't contribute much to the song (other than her usual grunting). [5/5]<br />3. Walk Away - At first listen, you may mistake it for just \\"another\\" ballad, but it's actaully pretty good. A bit long, but it's worth listening to up until the end (it gets better as it progresses). Good vocal showcase. [4/5]<br />4. Fighter - One of the best songs on the album! Definately a different, rockier, vibe for Christina. Great song to listen to if you're pissed off. [5/5]<br />5. Primer Amor (Interlude) - It's in Spanish. Yep. [N/A]<br />6. Infatuation - A lot of people seem to dislike this song, but it's pretty good if you're in the mood for a latin vibe. A bit \\"cookie-cutter,\\" but good, nonetheless. [4/5]<br />7. Loves Embrace (Interlude) - Xtina is one with nature. [N/A]<br />8. Loving Me 4 Me - It's not bad, but it's not good. The song just seems a bit bland after hearing all the excellent material on the album, thus far. Filler track. [2/5]<br />9. Impossible - Christina shows of her \\"blues\\" side, with Alicia Keys at the helm. A great song, aside from the unnecessary chatter at the beginning of the song. [4/5]<br />10. Underappreciated - Another filler track, but not as bad as \\"Loving Me 4 Me.\\" There's not a whole lot to say about it. [3/5]<br />11. Beautiful - The album's most popular song and flagship single. Althought it has lost a lot of its novelty with me (due to radio overplay), it's still a very good track. [5/5]<br />12. Make Over - What a mess. This track sounds like some hippy 60's song. Ok, so it's not THAT bad, but the chorus could have been better (why the screaming?). [2.5/5]<br />13. Cruz - An OK song. Musically appealing, but I'm not sure what to think of the lyrics. La-de-da. [2.5/5]<br />14. Soar - Good track, very \\"uplifting.\\" Most importantly, the song is catchy and her voice sounds good on it, as well. Solid track. [4/5]<br />15. Get Mine, Get Yours - Think of it as \\"Can't Hold Us Down,\\" but more sexual. Really good beats and even if the message IS a little \\"naughty,\\" it's a really good song. [5/5]<br />16. Dirrty - Perhaps the worst song to release as a first single. Not that it's a bad song, but definately not the best on the album. Red Man is a bit annoying, but overall a good track. [4/5]<br />17. Stripped (Part 2) - A continuation of the Stripped Intro. [N/A]<br />18. The Voice Within - Another favorite track on the album. You either love it or hate it, but the song is very beautiful and vocally outstanding. Great track. [5/5]<br />19. I'm Ok - Skip it. Just don't listen to it. I know this is supposed to be her \\"personal\\" track, but the song lacks anything musically appealing. [1/5]<br />20. Keep On Singing My Song - \\"Soar\\" Part II. The songs could have been clones of each other, except \\"Soar\\" is a lot better. [2.5/5]
B00004YA0T|3.0|Surely no conductor was a more persistent advocate of Bruckner's 9 symphonies. Jochum did not record the early \\"Study Symphony\\" or the so-called \\"Nullte\\" (#0) Symphony - he felt that Bruckner wanted them left un-performed.  He gave us the first \\"complete\\" set (1958-1965) on DG; this later Dresden EMI set surpasses it in some respects, and fails to match it in others. No complete set by one conductor is going to provide the last word on each symphony - some of them will be addressed better than others.<br /><br />How does Jochum/Dresden's complete set stand up to its rivals?  In my view, it's up against a weak field - its strongest competition comes from Jochum himself on DG. Both of Barenboim's (Chicago and Berlin) are very uneven. Solti is as subtle as a plumber's wrench.  Haitink is too careful and lightweight. Wand is cool and not that well recorded. Tintner is heavy-handed, and his orchestras are provincial.  Skrowaczewski is rather prosaic and has a second rate ensemble.  Karajan has many admirers - but I am not among them:  his interpretations, to me, sound sterile and uninvolving.<br /><br />Jochum on EMI has, with Dresden, one of the world's greatest orchestras.  His earlier set uses the Berlin Philharmonic in Symphonies 1,4 and 7-9 - the balance is with his own Bavarian Radio Symphony, which Jochum founded in 1949.<br /><br />On the basis of sound alone, the average listener is likely to prefer the Dresden, making it perhaps the best complete set for a newcomer to Bruckner's music - it is well-played, in modern sonics, and none of the performances is less than competent.<br /><br />However, the Berlin Philharmonic is outstanding and the Bavarian Radio plays well. I would give DG the prize in Symphonies 1, 2, 4 and 6, while Dresden/EMI is very slightly preferable in 5, 8 and 9.  For 3 and 7, it's a toss-up, although I lean towards DG in the Third.<br /><br />Jochum's DG performance of #1 is one of the two or three finest Firsts ever recorded: I think it's Jochum's finest traversal of ANY Bruckner Symphony. In #2, everything goes smoothly until the last movement, which I find a bit aggressive in both versions.  The DG #3 remains one of the finest stereo versions. I prefer Jochum's mono 1955 4th with the Bavarian Radio (on American Decca LP's) to either of those in the complete sets:  it simply sounds fresher, more rustic, and a little closer to the source.<br /><br />With Symphonies 5-9, the competition from other performances is overwhelming.  Jochum's is a highly polished Bruckner - others convey more of the rural Austrian composer's earthy side. To my ears, Jochum is outshone in the 8th and the 9th by conductors as varied as Furtwangler, Schuricht, Horenstein, and Asahina.<br /><br />Jochum's is not the last word in Bruckner - but he is a very fine spokesman.  Anyone wanting to explore Bruckner's symphonic world could hardly do better than either of these complete Jochum sets.  The EMI has excellent performances in modern recorded sound; the DG has a few superior readings, but in sound that is a bit dated.  Either set offers many hours of beautiful music making. [Update 7-27-07]: This set has been re-packaged as a super-budget offering from Brilliant Classics (ten discs, with the 1999 Skrowaczewski \\"Zero\\" thrown in as a filler). Copies of the Brilliant set were recently available on the Internet for $29.90 from Berkshire Record Outlet.
6303921248|5.0|I'm very picky and selective about what I like when it comes to period dramas, and I usually got for the late 19th c. or early 1900s stuff rather than the 1840s Jane Austen stuff. But I must admit I was deeply captivated by this mini-series, it succeeded with me where others may have failed. The witty, cultured dialogue was very enjoyable to listen to, yet accessible. I understood everything. I loved the story, especially the relationship between the pretty and likeable Elizabeth and the handsome, proud Mr. Darcy kept me guessing all the time if his good qualities would shine through after he started falling for her and if she would soften up to him or not as I was hoping they would end up together after all. I was not disappointed.  <br />David Rehak<BR>author of &quot;Love and Madness&quot;
0783113943|5.0|If you want to understand how a person could ever fall into the world of drug addiction, Gia is the movie. I was never able to understand why a famous, beautiful women could get into that drug. I was never able to comprehend the idea of a lesbian relationship. Gia is a perfect storie to understand and learn the life of a drug addict and the fact that past her relationship with Linda, All Gia wanted was to be loved. Gia's storie is a trajic beauty as well as a beautifully done film. I wouldn't change anything in the film it was perfect. Besides her incredible life, the reason Gia made a huge impact on me was Anjolina  Joli's exceptional performance. I believed I was  watching Gia. I would compare the film to the movie \\"Blow\\" staring MR. Depp. I strongly feel Johnny Depp and Anjolina Joli need to make a film together. To see Two of the most realistic, extreme, talented actors out there would no doubt be powerful. Gia was an incredible film, well written and just unforgettable.

0553573403|4.0|this book is excellent and all around entertaining.  the story starts a little slow, but the final 200 pages are awesome.  the only thing i was not a fan of was the graphic sex.  i am an adult, but i thought some of the in depth descriptions of sex organs (especially male) was a little tasteless.  However it was a small problem and overall this is a great story, if you have the patience  for a series over 2000 pages long in only 3 books.
0671449028|5.0|Next to Goodnight Moon, this is our top choice for a bedtime read.  The text is lulling & the drawings are adorable.<br />The animals are on a boat (some say this is confusing to children - it is supposed to be silly!) and they are getting ready for bed.  They go through the usuals - bathtime, jammies, teeth brushing...with a little goofiness thrown in - a little late night exercise!  Just enough for a little grin before settling down.<br />Classic Boyton!!
6303282237|4.0|While we all wait for the US/GB distributors to pull their fingers out with a top-notch DVD release, fanatics can get the best yet 'El Cid' from Amazon France's marketplace sellers.  This DVD comes with an English soundtrack, the only problem being that you can't erase the accompanying subtitles.  However, the print quality is fair, it's in the full Cinemascope aspect ratio, and at a cost of only a few Euros is bound to rate as a steal even with postage to the US included.
0689835604|5.0|I really enjoy this book.  The wording is simple, the drawings are bright and colorful.  This holds a 7 month old's attention just fine!  My only negative is about the flaps.  While the book itself is made of sturdy board, the flaps are very thin & slick.  They can be difficult to lift (even for adult fingers) and when a 7 month old wants to \\"help\\" it is tough to have hands on without the flaps tearing.<br />All in all - a great book with simple lessons about where the eyes, hands, feet, belly button, etc...are on a child.  The ending is the best one - we always have a mini-game of peek-a-boo with the last 'baby' in the book.<br />Would recommend to all, but also recommend keeping the flaps just out of reach.
B00006879E|4.0|This has come to be one of my favorite CD's. The lead singers voice, for one, draws you in. It's very different but very nice. Some of the songs are a bit pop like, but the rest its hard to put your thumb on what they are. Definatly worth a look, though. I originally bought it just for the song &quot;this love&quot; but after listening to the whole thing, each song is really great. You won't want to skip a song.
B00005JMFQ|3.0|After hearing the buzz about &quot;Love Actually&quot; I was very much looking forward to the DVD, well now that I have seen it, I can say that I was not very impressed with it. The various stories take place in the month in December in the weeks leading up to Christmas. For the most part, I found most the stories to be so unbelivible.  The only one that seemed real was the story of actress Laura Linney character trying to find love while dealing with a mentally ill brother.  That story was the only reason that I gave &quot;Love Actually&quot; three stars. But truly a movie that is not as good as the previews make it out to be.
0345440900|1.0|Not much better than Babywise.  Why are we so obsessed with sleep and schedules?  This book advocates not feeding your child unless the clock as well as the child says it is time.  This leads to insufficient milk supply and failure to thrive.  Don't do it.  Babies cry because they have an unfulfilled need.  If you are willing to hold your baby, sing to your baby, nurse your baby, then you don't need this book.  Intuition is better than some artificially forced and unnatural schedule.  Your baby will settle into the schedule that is right for him/her.  Trust yourself and your intuition, and if you need help, then don't isolate yourself -- seek out other mothers!
B0001GOH6Q|2.0|Tim Burton is a great director and from the previews &quot;Big Fish&quot; looked really great. But after seeing it I wished that I had rented the DVD and not bought it. &quot;Big Fish&quot; is not really a film that I would think that Tim Burton would make. It more of a story about the relationship between a father and son that have not spoken in many years. The visual are good, but they don't allow Tim Burton to show the viewer what he can do. And he is great director.  &quot;Big Fish&quot; is an okay, but Tim Burton was allow to show his best work.
0679428895|4.0|I bought this book two months ago, along with several other novels and guidebooks, to help me prepare for a trip to Italy.  I read a few reviews that were less than favorable and was a bit worried that the book would get tied down in engineering prose about aquaducts... Don't get me wrong.  I am curious about the technology of such amazing architectural feats... but I would need visuals to tackle such a topic.<BR>Needless to say, I was totally surprised at how much of a #pager-turner# this was for me. I began and finished the novel on the subway, with several reading breaks snuck in at home and basically whenever I could (standing on the street waiting for a bus, etc.). I was wholly engrossed by the first pages and hated arriving at my destinations and having to put the book down until the next ride.<BR>If you are the type to fantasize about what it might have been like to witness life under the Roman empire and in the fateful city of Pompeii, I would recommend this book.  I am generally a skeptic when it comes to historical fiction and documentaries that attempt to put a face on ruins and skeletons, but this book failed to offend my sensibilities.  I gave it four stars rather than five only because I am sure there will be some historians who challenge some of the facts or liberties taken by the author and because I was so disappointed to finish the novel!  As for wanting more, I do!!!  Now who will write a nice non-fiction that delves into some of the details that Harris attempts to recreate??
B000058T5E|1.0|This album is garbage. These people giving it 4 and 5 stars must be part of the 40 people trying to unload the copy they were duped into buying. You want the essential Jeff Beck? 1. Blow by Blow...2. Wired...3. There And Back. That's all you need right now. But don't hold your breath for another album of their caliber to come along.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Great, if you don't mind blood spurting!<BR>This is a great mix of movie styles, including animation, and garden hose blood spurting.<BR>If you don't like movies that are a little different, then don't bother.<BR>If you liked Pulp Fiction and you like Japanese cartoons, then you will like it.
B00000BKDS|5.0|I listened this album after listening some albums from the metal gods, Iron Maiden. When I listened this album first time I was enchanted, even when I found kinda weird the new vocalist (all of the albums I heard before this was in the Dickinson era) Iron Maiden is a very focused and talented effort made by such young musicians that by them they showed a very big maturity since their first release, something very rare to find in the rock scene even nowadays. Iron Maiden's self-tittled album is powerful, raw, headbanging inducing, sometimes sound a little bit punky but definitely years light above punk rock. I've lost and bought this album 3 times (which means that it must be very good and essential if I spend the money again for hearing songs I know by heart) Since the begginning of the album to the ending ALL the tracks are amazing, and you can appreciate it better if you listen it in the order that it has (that means without shuffling) The first track prowler is a very hard and rythmic rocker, with GREAT guitar sound that you can almost touch it, the solos, everything seems to make a conspiration for keeping you hearing it. Then comes Sanctuary which is basically a punk-metal rock song and one of my favorites specially live, then comes the more mellow, and melodic remember tomorrow which in some point rocks hard but basically is a melodic song which evokes a lot of nostalgia to me. Running free is a very catchy song, with a very nice drums intro. Phantom of the opera is the most elaborate of the songs, very ambitious, complex, that's up to me the song that shows the superiority of Iron Maiden above all the other debuting bands of their time, a band that can make such a delicious masterpiece in their first effort is something really extraordinary. Not many bands make a 7 minutes epic song in their first recording and do it so... well done as Iron Maiden, and believe me Phantom of the Opera is not a boring song, and has no fillers all the parts of that song are essential part of it. After that comes Transylvania, a shocking instrumental that shows again the prodigiousity of Iron Maiden, since their first stages. Transylvania fuses with the slow and sometimes Pink-Floydesque(?) Strange World creating up to me the most spiritual momentum of the album. Then comes Charlotte the Harlot, with very good lyrics, that talk about a subject that will be always vigent, prostitution. Charlotte is a very hard rocker that in some part becomes a little bluesy. And the closure is by the energetic Iron Maiden, which leaves you with the feeling of waking from a dream or something, definitely a very smart way of finishing an album. All of the songs of this album kick-ass, and they can be heared separately or between a various artist heavy metal set of songs, but I recommend you that someday take the time and hear it completely and in order, trust me you won't repent.<br />Warning: This album is not recommended for hip-hoppers, casual Iron Maiden fans, NU-Metal posers, Poppers, etc.
B000084T18|4.0|50 Cents has poor diction and a drawling rap style, but with the help of clever lyrics, backup artists, and good beats, producers Dr. Dre and Eminem make the album much more than it would have been in lesser hands.<br />Overall most of the songs on this track are quite entertaining and there are lots of songs on here, including some hidden bonus tracks.  On long car trips I don't find myself yearning to skip songs, which in the age of CDs, means I must like the CD overall quite a bit.<br />Yet, there aren't a lot of great songs here.  In Da Club, the most popular, is the best.  There are a handful of other really good ones (see below).<br />I rate this CD a very respectable FOUR stars: <br />What Up Gangster *<BR>Many Men (Wish Death) *<BR>In Da Club **<br />Patiently Waiting and 21 Questions are near stars.<br />I also like P.I.M.P. but the embarrassingly bad performance of this song by 50 Cent and Snoop Dogg at the MTV Music Awards turned me off of this song.<BR> <br />---------------------------------------------------------------<BR>Ratings: CDs are rated simply by how many good songs are on the album. Great songs get two stars, and good songs get one star. Songs that get no stars are those that I might like but not enough to give it a star or ones I find boring or actively dislike. CDs are not penalized for songs that I don't like because they are easy enough to skip over. There is no maximum number of stars a CD can get, but of course the more stars it gets, the better the CD.
B0001W8Q9Y|5.0|It's been awhile since a Marillion CD has captured me. Anorak, Radiation, and Marillion.com had their highlights, but weren't up there with some of Marillion's previous work. My first experience with Marillion CD's that end up being my favorites usually starts off with me wondering why I spent my money. Then on the second listen, certain songs or sections start to evolve on me. Before I know it, there are 3 songs that I am playing over and over to the exclusion of the others. Then when I finally listen to the others, I am struck by the power and intelligence of the music. This album followed that trend for me. So if you listen to it once and wonder what on earth you are listening to, all I can say is &quot;play it again!!!&quot;  You just can't play it once and get it.
B00006690G|5.0|Whether you love him or hate him, it's hard to deny that Eminem is the best rapper today, and may be the best rapper of all time. His clear diction, rapid fire delivery, innovative beats, and clever lyrics make for very entertaining music.<br />The Eminem Show follows up the Grammy winning Marshall Mathers LP with a bang.  The great thing about this LP is it doesn't fall into the trap of so many artisits, especially rap artists, of basically putting out follow-up LPs that sound the same as their last album.  This is a new, fresh piece of work with the same clever lyrics and controversial, in your face style we've come to expect.<br />Without Me, probably the most popular song on the album (excepting possibly Cleaning Out My Closet which got a lot of airplay for the cleaned-up version), is my favorite.  But all the songs, with a few expeptions, are very entertaining.  This is not a CD for  which I find myself reaching for the skip button after every other song.<br />I rate this CD an impressive SIX stars: <br />White America *<BR>Buisness *<BR>Cleanin Out My Closet *<BR>Without Me **<BR>Superman *<br />Most of the other songs on the CD are very good too.  This is one of my most listened to LPs. <BR>---------------------------------------------------------------<BR>Ratings: CDs are rated simply by how many good songs are on the album.

B00005ATZT|5.0|From the original STAR WARS trilogy to his INDIANA JONES movies and on to his Tom Clancy roles--and with a few offbeat roles like BLADE RUNNER thrown in!--Harrison Ford was the #1 movie star of the of the 1980s and 90s.  But as Ford went from intergalactic hired gun to archaelogist and finally, the President, he made one movie that stamped him as ONE HELL OF AN ACTOR!!!--THE FUGITIVE!!!<br />It's the old David Janssen tv show brought to the big screen for the first time as Harrison Ford takes over Janssen's role as Dr. Richard Kimble, a man wrongly sentenced for the murder of his wife and who manages to escape from a prison bus when it collides with a train.  Tommy Lee Jones costars in THE ROLE OF HIS LIFE as US Marshall Sam Gerard, obsessed with one thing:<BR>GET RICHARD KIMBLE!!!  But Harrison Ford on the run isn't easy to catch!<br />Director Andrew Davis does a great job directing--his UNDER SEIGE was good, too, but nothing like this!--with a terrific script and lots of action, and the Jerry Goldsmith music is almost as good as in the original PLANET OF THE APES!<br />THE FUGITIVE on tv was one of the best tv shows ever, but THE FUGITIVE movie is even better!<br />THE FUGITIVE IS HARRISON FORD'S BEST MOVIE!!!
B000002JPA|5.0|Considered by many to be Dream Theater's greatest release, which is quite a statement given the extremely high quality of the rest of their discography.  &quot;Pull Me Under&quot; is a straightforward rocker that was their &quot;hit&quot; song of this album, yet it maintains a much higher musical quality than nearly any other Billboard-topping single of then or today.  &quot;Take the Time&quot;, &quot;Metropolis Pt. 1&quot;, and especially &quot;Learning to Live&quot; are all epics that thoroughly amaze and inspire.  &quot;Wait for Sleep&quot; and &quot;Another Day&quot; are softer songs that break from the powerful style of the rest of the album and instead entertain by their soft, simple beauty.  &quot;Surrounded&quot; and &quot;Under a Glass Moon&quot; are two underrated but nonetheless supurb compositions that deserve just as much play as the rest of the album, which they'll probably get, because you'll play this album from beginning to end, over and over, without ever getting bored.
B00000K19E|5.0|With groundbreaking special effects technology, a philisophical / scientific story and easily watchable - The Matrix has it all. Keanu Reeves is Neo, the hacker believed by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) to be the ass kicking Christ-like figure who must save the enslaved world from the Matrix. To do so, he must battle the agents, dodge bullets, have beautifully chereographed fight scenes and one hell of a shootout. Carrie-Anne Moss is the woman Neo loves and is loved by, Trinity.<br />A mesmerizing, eye popping visual extravaganza that redefined science fiction and revitalized interest in the theme of man VS machine - mixed in with religion, philosophy and some great lines from Laurence Fishburne, you have a cyberpunk classic which can be seen again and again - a phenomenon.
B000059TEP|4.0|This film is definately one of the best films of 1990.  Demi Moore, Patrick Swayze, and Whoopi Goldberg all played wonderful parts in Ghost.  This film is one of the most original Romance movies ever made. The plot is never slow.  The movie is funny, clever, charming, and intriguing.  The villain comes unexpectedly, and once the action starts it never seems to stop.  This is a definate movie must for anyone that loves romance movies.  If you are a fan of Demi, Patrick, and Whoopi this is definately the perfect movie for you.
B00006IUL7|5.0|I would never give Insomnia a definition - a thriller yet sunshine set, a cat-and-rat game yet also rat-jolts-cat, a cruelty murder line yet faded in the psycho confusion. Everything in Insomnia seemed to free out the stereotypes as it's supposed to be. Things of this kind can always be boring and pale if not for atmospheric direction and top-notch performances.<br />Starring three Oscar winners, Insomnia follows its artistic pacing without losing any commercial attraction. Al Pacino, a top favourite of mine, is prominent again as a sleep-losing yet conscionable veteran cop, occasionally losing his mind but never losing his heart. Robin Williams, gives a convincing flick of a devil shielded with a writer's position. He's shrewd and almost controlling before you, yet fragile and vulnerable behind. The only regret is that the character was reduced at it's screenplay level, with only forty minutes screen time. Williams leads the role as a dominant yet also an undercurrent, with a dark impact, which was insinuated in the endless shining set and Al Pacino's progressive sleeplessness.<br />Beyond these two men's insomnia circle, Swank, portrayed an idolizing yet astute enough young cop, timely refreshing you and rightfully-oriented when you are becoming fatigued and confused with the two men's psychological battle. Slightly pale yet still lovable at the same time. Maura Tierney also lends a helping hand as the Hotel manager who sympathises with Pacino's character.<br />Director Chris Nolan covered all these twists with atmospheric directing, not showing off yet blatant which, normally seen in Hollywood thrillers, restrains story-telling and thought-evoking. He delivered a masterpiece which you can see many times without being bored.
B00004RFFI|5.0|This film will blow you away.  Twister, firstly, has some of the most realistic and visually stunning special effects that I have ever seen in a movie.  It is almost like watching a Discovery Channel documentary, but better.  The plot is gripping, and filled with non stop action.  The acting is really wonderful, especially Helen Hunt's.  The thrills keep on coming and they never at anytime get dull or boring.  You leave the movie with a better appreciation of tornadoes.  It actually teaches you something.  For any hardcore action fan, this is the movie for you.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|This film basks in its' own wondrous excess. The excess varies from four letter words to violence to clothing to money. Al Pacino crafts one of the greatest performances of his career as the hedonistic Tony Montana - as a Cuban refugee who makes it good in being bad with cocaine up his nose and a penchant for uncontrollable paranoia fuelled by instinctual violent tactics in his empire. <br />The supporting cast is filled with a wealth of brilliant performances headlined by Michelle Pfieffer and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio. If you are looking for top of the line writing by Oliver Stone and brilliant direction from Brian DePalma, then Scarface (1983) is the perfect choice. Without delving into the plot, the rise and fall of a criminal mastermind has never been portrayed so energetically and passionately. As one watches, one can see and feel the collective joy of the creators at work.
B0001Z53CY|3.0|Now all i have to say about this album when I listened to it was ok. Let me explain why the intro was the absolute best ive ever herd. the second and third songs are good on the album. I thought that the 4th song sucked. All the skits sucked except the one about bizarre freestyling. There was really no ending to the cd like previous albums for instance obie trice had a phat outro. SOmething like that would have  been nice. My band is ok I get sick of listening to that song after about the 5th or 6th time it gets really annoying so i skip it to the next track. 40 oz is ok not as great as everybody has been sayin it to be and they need to avoid working with other producers everyone sucks for producers except dre and em if u look at who produced the tracks for instance kayne west did d12 world the flows are tight the beat sucks. I thought get my gun was the best song on the cd classic shady records material thats what seperates them from everyone else and i believe #9 on the album hell of a chorus and again classic raps by d12 and if you dont know who the hell d12 is by now then u dont listen to rap cuz i knew who was singing what from the 1st cd thats just me. But i give this cd 3 out of 5 not the best ive herd i thought devils night was much better and still listen to it to this day. if you want to download a few songs on internet i would highly reccomend that unless u can buy it for 9.99 somewhere other than that i wouldnt rush to buy it cuz i was slightly disapointed i hope this review helps out.
B00000K0DT|5.0|The Usual Suspects, is, in my mind, one of the most fantastic pieces of film-making ever to grace our screens. That a group of people can come up with a piece of fiction that is so excellent in every way, from start to finish, is frightening. Who knows, maybe this film has no superior.<br />A lot is made of the film's ending. Not for a moment am I going to let slip what exactly that is. I would never deny another film lover the sheer sense of amazement that ran through my body when the film reached its climax. While not the film's only strong point; this is a masterpiece ALL the way through, the ending will blow you away.<br />The cast is, in a word, flawless. Kevin Spacey has, as far as I am concerned, never been better. He turns in a performance that is so moving and outstanding that he should have got three Oscars. But he is not alone. Byrne is fantastic, Del Toro adds continental flair, and Postlethwaite is disturbingly dark, yet calculated.<br />By all means watch this film, and observe its strong points, from Bryan Singer's masterful direction to the equally pleasing musical score. Prepare yourself for a rollercoaster ride and the best ending EVER in a film made anywhere in the world. I mean that. Just who is Kasier Soseh?
B000068TPN|5.0|Without a doubt the best movie on the vietnam war since &quot;Platoon&quot;<BR>  I give this movie two thumbs up! Mel Gibson, as always does not displease and neither do the other star studded cast members.<BR>Based on one of the first battles fought between Americans and the North Vietnamese it graphically portrays our American boys for what they really are, heros! I highly recommend it to anyoe who is sick of seeing the Americans always portrayed as the bad guys of the Vietnam War.
B00000DGUY|2.0|Make no mistake, Dire Straits made some classic material and all their studio albums (with the possible exception of On Every Street) were first rate, and Mark Knopfler is one of the most talented guitarist and songwriters around as well as a brilliant lyricist.  Dire Straits were seen as much more of an 'albums' band than a singles band.  <br />However I found this 'Best of' compilation disappointing; it is not a good reflection of the group as a whole. 'Sultans of Swing', 'Romeo and Juliet' and 'Tunnel of Love' are all here, but most of the remaining tracks are either edited or not worthwhile enough inclusions which is where this set falls down. <br />'Twisting By the Pool' is a thoroughly cheesy song which sits uncomfortably with most of the groups other material with its appalling lyrics!.  A dud live version of a track which was appealing in its original studio form is also included with 'Love Over Gold'.  'Money For Nothing' is not only edited but the second verse is omitted here.  Ditto 'Brothers In Arms', as a result the brilliant guitar solo at the end is omitted.  Other tracks which were not included but should have been are 'Skateaway' (from Making Movies), and the superb 'Telegraph Road', which was one of Dire Straits' best songs ever.  <br />Probably the best answer to this would be a double CD (like Billy Joel's Greatest Hits package among others).  You're better to collect the original studio albums (and possibly the live ones too) than buy this, and Knopfler's solo albums are also worth considering.
0385486804|5.0|this book is a short read well worth your time. you will not want to put it down. its the true story of a lost disenfranchised kid who thinks he can find his answers tramping in alaska. a must read for anyone who thinks they are alone in their quest for meaning!
B00000099Y|5.0|Rest assured, the Gods smiled on us when Tool entered the music scene!  This band manages to &quot;have it all&quot;--distinctive sound in a style all its own, awesome vocals, thought-provoking lyrics, rhythm that builds up to a thrilling crescendo amidst a pounding drumbeat--and you only have to listen once to find yourself &quot;hooked.&quot;  Almost like you've been driving a beater car for years and suddenly find yourself racing corners in the sweetest luxury car on earth!  <br />Maynard James Keenan is a superb singer (I could listen to him mesmerize me all day!), Danny Carey exudes raw, heart thumping power on drums, and the talent in this band overall is simply phenomenal.  There isn't a &quot;bad&quot; song on this entire CD, a rarity to be sure when so many bands out there produce one or two decent tracks on an entire disk.<br />Thanks, Tool, for taking the progressive, alternative, heavy metal categories, adding your own special spice to the mix, elevating the lyrics, and then kicking it up a notch! You rock my world!
B00005K9LN|5.0|This is Judas Pirest's all time greatest album, featuring some of the heaviest and darkest (Rapid Fire, Breaking the Law) but also some of their softest (United, Living after Midnight).  <BR>Though some may say that this is sell out, too different, too simple, or lacking lead singer, Rob halford's, astonishing, operetic vocals, this is, in fact, the band in thier fool glory.  <BR>The only dud on theis album would be Steeler.  Sorely lacking melody and innevitably boring, it is a bad way to finish of the ablum.  All else is brilliant.<BR>OH, and the riff to 'The Rage' is simply a blues lick interupted by heavy chord progressions for Princess Irulan.
B0001M0A4I|5.0|BEAUTIFUL! Such a pleasant CD to listen to. As a die-hard Tony Banks fan, you will not be disappointed with this release. The highlight moments in the music are when Tony's signature chord changes soar through the modern orchestra arrangments.
B000148KK2|1.0|on this recording the folks at Verve Music Group have put some software on the CD so that when you put it into your CD-ROM the disc is identified as a data disc.  You then need to run their software to be able to play it...  that is fine until you have a player that also recognizes digital format discs (such as the Kenwood Z919 in my car).  You put the disc in, and you get nothing as the player sees the executable file and none of the audio tracks.<br />Thank you very much for a worthless CD... I refuse to go an buy an additional piece of hardware to be able to play this disc.
B000000WJZ|5.0|This is the breakout album for the Pumpkins that brought them into the mainstream in a good way. The explosive guitar riffs and melodic voice of Billy Corgan on this CD are amazing. This is there best album to date every song is creatively unique. Standout tracks are Cherub Rock which is my favorite, Mayonnaise comes in 2nd, Rocket, Disarm, Today, & Luna actually every song the whole album is outstanding. One of my favorite CD's of the early 90's. You can't match that sound of the Pumpkins on this album it's so unique & different. Chamberlains drumming is incredible and the production by Butch Vig is so definitive and excellently mastered. An essential CD to anyone who likes true alternative music.
B00005B3Z6|1.0|Why do people like this? Its not like real life at all and in fact has done nothing but stain the reputation of hard working, moral, intelligent gay men.
B00005ATQD|5.0|The final film from the master Kubrick. An eerie detached exploration of erotic desire & obsession. The story an argument on fidelity with wife sends a doctor in NYC to check out the seedy Manhatten underground  streets & into a variety of sexual encounters and situations. Tom Cruise plays the sexual frustrated know it all attitude doctor and I have to say he is not one of my favorites but he does pull this off quite well. Nicole Kidman plays his curious wife. He ends up at an exclusive  secret upper-class orgy which could lead to dangerous consequences. The cinematography is dark and creepy in usual Kubrick fashion. The acting is incredible & the storyline is unique. The movie touches on the dark side of sexual desires of one man who thought he knew it all   but realized his eyes were wide shut. One of my favorite Kubrick films worth viewing.
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|Burton has once again proven that he is a modern day visionary and a genius.  Unlike some of TBs other films that provide the visual stimuli but lack the story, this movie is dead on with both!  Visually stunning with a moving story, Burton really molds, orchestrates and arranges this story into a beautiful symphony of wonder and surprise bringing us all back to a time when we may have actually believed that a fairy tale could be true.  The only reason for the 4.5/5 is that I felt that when it all &quot;came around&quot; at the end, there were a couple of loose ends i.e. questions left unanswered (but I may just need to watch again?)  Anyway, if you're an unimaginative, ordinary person who can no longer summon any of the vision, wonder, or joy you had as a youth, you will really hate this movie, however, if your a dreamer, an artist, or the type of person that sees a rainbow and thinks that Kermit is probably out there somewhere perched on a log jamming out the &quot;Rainbow Connection&quot; on banjo, you'll love it like I did.
0671015206|4.0|I enjoyed the Millionaire Next Door. This was my first read on this subject and at first I believed non of the information or ideas in the book would be helpful to me. I was very wrong! The Millionaire Next Door was especially helpful to me as an 18 year old because it gave practical advice on spending wisely. It emphasized the importance of purchasing smart, or purchasing within your range and only purchasing necessary items. The suggestions the author gave were not far-fetched, but applicable to my life. He stressed that achieving millionaire status does not happen overnight but instead takes many years. Sacrifice and saving are crucial. I liked the profiles of average millionaires. The Millionaire Next Door dispelled a lot of prenominations I had about millionaires. Just because someone doesn't live in a fancy neighborhood or drive a fancy sports car doesn't mean they don't have a million dollars of accumulated wealth. My only question is, with the Save, Save, Save motto, when do you get to enjoy your million dollars?
B00001OH7J|5.0|I'll second everything in the previous reviews. \\"Photo Finish\\" is a showcase for Gallagher's incredible virtuosity, running the gamut from pedal-to-the-metal ravers to slow, reflective pieces. \\"Shin Kicker\\" and \\"Brute Force\\" are personal favorites, but there is not a weak track to be found. I had the pleasure of meeting and interviewing Rory after a show at Toad's Place near Yale U in the late 70s, on the \\"Top Priority\\" tour, absolutely smoking performance. He played one of Jimi Hendrix' old Strats that still had burn marks on it. I own practically everything he ever recorded, including some old Taste LPs; I even named my son Rory!
B0001WTUH6|2.0|The concept was great and the initial visuals, although not new still set a nice tone. The vampires jump off a tower and land as if they just stood up off of a couch. Sharp teeth everywhere, glowing eyes, and guns a blazing...all else is downhill!<br />The vampires show NO SUPERNATURAL ABILITIES other than the jumping and only the head lead vampire (not Kate Beckinsales character) show any strength or ability to do anything but shoot guns!<br />It tries so hard to be The Matrix meets the occult but ends up being the bondage vampires with no powers against the really big hairy werewolves! At least those guys fought fair and had cool transformations! As was previusly mentioned ian another review the vampires even have reflections! I wouldn't be surprised if they even walked outside by day!<br />Stay away from this one!
B000002H97|3.0|They wouldn't let me do 3.5, so I did 3. Metallica went alternative on this album, which is a stinker, but suprisingly they handle it quite well. The first half is far better than the second half. The first half includes Enter Sandman, Sad But True, Unforgiven, among others. the second half is rather dissapointing with nothing really standout except for Nothing Else Matters and My Friend Of Misery. This was Metallica's most commercially succesful album, due to it being released at the time of the alternative explosion. This album is quite well done, but stay away from their work after this. Their post-black album stuff reeks horribly. This is the last decent Metallica album.
B000003TAW|5.0|O god where to begin. Weezer, this team is hardly a band. They're artists. Weezer is the most insprational music out there. You gotta love poetic punks from all over the U.S. creating a music revolution. This CD is among my most valuables. Dont start with Green or Pinkerton, Blue will tell you all you need to know to get you started. Trust me, as soon as you crack the seal you will be a fan for life.
B000002JNJ|5.0|This is (pretty much) the album that started it all. Although there were albums by Pantera before this, they are not in print anymore. There is a considerable amount of power metal and thrash metal, so this does not sound exactly like Vulgar Display Of Power. But it is still fantastic. The songs are heavy, fast and headbanging. The ballad, Cemetary Gates, even has headbanging parts. I would truly reccomend this album to any metalhead.
B000001E18|5.0|I was absolutely confused and even a bit turned off when I first heard this album after their best album &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; because this album is almost purely electronic in a lot of places. Originally meant to be an EP, this turned out to be a full-length album and the result is really intriguing and really challenging for the listener, something that many fans seem to not want to be. At the same time, it is a relatively mellow album. <br /> My favorite songs are &quot;Numb&quot;, &quot;Stay Faraway So Close&quot; and &quot;Daddy's Gonna Pay For Your Crashed Car&quot;. &quot;Stay&quot; is my absolute favorite song on this album having a really melancholy, dramatic sound to it. I really love the beat too. <br /> I hated this album when I first heard it but it grew on me over time and now I really enjoy it. Still, it doesn't come anywhere close to let's say &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; nor even &quot;Unforgettable Fire&quot; but &quot;Zooropa&quot; is a fun ride for the listener. Newbies would be better off starting elsewhere but otherwise, enjoy the ride!
B00006GFAB|5.0|KISS is one of those bands, that no matter how hard you try, you just can't get every good song of theirs on a greatest hits. Theis one is done quite well, actually. All the favorites are here, and the filler is not present except for Beth. This was my first KISS album, and I soon bought many more afterward. The sheer atomic power that only a band like KISS could produce is pesent, and I love the packaging. My personal favorites are Strutter, I Love It Loud, New York Groove, and I Was Made For Lovin' You.
0671042858|4.0|The book &quot;The Girl who Loved Tom Gordon&quot; written by Stephen King was the kind of book you couldnt put down! It was awesome. Its about a girl who goes hiking in the woods with her family and they constantly agrue and she had to use the bathroom really bad so she went in the woods without telling her mom or brother,and when she was done she was LOST! for several days and ran into some unusal things. This is the book that you wonder &quot;whats going to happen next?&quot;. I would say for everyone to read this book,and this isnt the typical Stephen King book you would have in mind its from a whole different point of view.
B00008OLIO|5.0|This is the Crue's first album and probably the best. Not one song comes close to being bad. This was the last Motley Crue album I bought, I did'nt think it would be so good. How wrong I was. It couldn't be better. The guitars are rough and raw, the singing is obnoxious and loud. Nikki Sixx's songwiting is genius. No one exept Nikki can take great pop melodies and turn them metal. Yes, this is one of my all-time favorite albums. Buy it and you will see why.
0789723107|5.0|I'll make it simple, like this book's title :)<br />1. GREAT BOOK! Worth to collect if you're someone involved in web design<br />2. Easy to read, both the language & the lay out<br />3. Good for professionals both amateurs<br /><br />So? What're you waiting for?
0792846443|5.0|When he manned the filmed adaptation of Stephen King's great 1987 best-seller MISERY in 1990, Rob Reiner, known at that time mainly for hilarious comedies like THIS IS SPINAL TAP (1983), THE PRINCESS BRIDE (1987) and WHEN HARRY MET SALLY...(1989), showed that he could also direct a suspenseful thriller. He did a terrific job. Starring James Caan as injured, cynical romance novelist Paul Sheldon, and Kathy Bates as obsessed nurse and &quot;Number-One Fan&quot; Annie Wilkes, MISERY is perfectly cast and is one of the few truly successful Stephen King film adapatations. Indeed, in some ways it is even better than the book! It keeps the dark, cynical humor and concentrates more on the psychological cat-and-mouse game between Sheldon and Wilkes than on visual shocks. It definitely tones down the level of graphic violence from the novel; for example, Annie carries a sledgehammer instead of an axe. Also, she has no electric knife in the movie. Although the book's gore was effectively disturbing in written form, it would have been unnecessary and distracting in the film version.<br />Better yet, Reiner focuses on the character-driven psychological horror and suspense, which draws you in right from the beginning and never lets up. James Caan strikes the right note for his portrayal of the bedridden Paul Sheldon. With his subtle, cynical, sarcastic, detached tone, Caan conveys a talented author whose whole world turned upside down, along with his car, on an icy road in the middle of nowhere. Being cared for/imprisoned by crazy, obsessed nurse Annie Wilkes, Caan creates a sympathetic character who refuses to accept himself as a helpless victim. Kathy Bates, in her first-ever filmic starring role, became the perfect embodiment of the Annie Wilkes that Stephen King had created in his novel, and as a result, deservedly won the Oscar for Best Actress in 1990 (unusual for a Horror/Suspense film). Up to that point, Kathy Bates had been mainly a stage actress and was very well knownin those circles, but she was virtually unknown to Hollywood despite having appeared in over 15 movies. MISERY quickly put her on the map, and she subsequently starred in excellent and diverse films such as FRIED GREEN TOMATOES (1991), DOLORES CLAIBORNE (another Stephen King adaptation, it was released in 1995 and should have earned her another Oscar nomination, at the very least), TITANIC (1997) and PRIMARY COLORS (1998).<br />Also notable in MISERY are the supporting actors: Richard Farnsworth as the town sheriff who gets involved in the search for the missing author, Frances Sternhagen as his cranky wife and assistant, and Lauren Bacall, in a welcome return to the screen as Paul Sheldon's agent, who initiates the search process. The story is well-paced, the dialogue priceless, the claustrophobic cinematography excellent. MISERY is one of the very best Stephen King adaptations, and was one of the best films of 1990.<br />MOST RECOMMENDED
B0001DI0FI|4.0|Unfortunately for Crowe and crew this movie had the bad timing of being released after the summer of \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\".  Try as it might, it can't reach for the same panache.  I can't figure out why.  The movies are set in diffrent eras, about 50 to 60 years apart.  They aren't even the same genre apart from the fact that they are sea epics.   Maybe it needed a spunky Keira Knightly to order everyone around (the book does actually contain a female character).  As bluff and strong as Crowe's Captain Jack Aubrey is, he can't erase the memory of Depp's dreadlocked, eyelinered and drunken lisped Captain Jack Sparrow.  Also, the military crew in P.O.C seemed more spit and polish.  I had a hard time believing that Captain Aubrey would let his men get so dirty, lazy and careless, no matter how long they were at sea.  Maybe the mistake was in marketing the movie as a swashbuckler when it was really a claustrophobic character piece.<br />Anyway, the film looks gorgeous.  It nails its time period wonderfully.  But the most interesting stories were of the young midshipmen.  The children who were drafted into service.  I wished the film would have spent more time with them.  I wanted to know more about Mr. Blakeney and also about the doomed Mr. Hollom.  But just as their stories get going, we are back to Aubrey and his friend Maturin fighting about the Galapagos Island.  Why did they keep that subplot in?  That should have been out in the first draft.<br />I also feel that the film should have been true to the book and had Aubrey fighting Americans.  That was where the bite of the story was.  But I think everyone thought that would not have been p.c.  However they do give a nod to the original by having the French sailing around in a high tech American made boat.<br />All in all, this was a well made film.  Once you can get past the fact that it is not an adventure tale, it has a lot to offer.<br />I gave this Dvd 4 stars instead of 5 because there are no film commentaries.  The director does have a small documentary about how he wrote the screenplay but it doesn't compare.  Again \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\"  had the documentaries and it had 3 film commentaries (the director and Depp,  Keira Knightly and Jack Davenport, and all the screenwriters).  Why couldn't they do the same for this film?  Will it alway be in the shadow of a popcorn movie?  If they plan to release a bigger version later, I really don't think it will generate that much interest.  Everything should have been released now!
B0000024JN|5.0|I bought this album when it came out in 1986 and have listened to it, on and off, ever since.  Every track is excellent and it's also great as an album.  The fact that no one has been able to copy their style is a testament to how creative and groundbreaking this album is and was.  &quot;Because I'm hard-hittin', always spittin, cool as hell.  I got the trees on my mirror so my car won't smell.  Sittin' 'round the house, gettin' high, watchin' tube.  I'm eatin' colonel's chicken, drinkin' Heineken brew.&quot;  I love these guys.
0385410646|4.0|This is the perfect fantasy for anyone who's not afraid to be different.  Instantly drawn to this story, I found myself getting further and further into the plot while relating more and more with Vianne Rocher and her delightful daughter Anouk.  <BR>    Filled with vivid depictions of a small-town attitude contradicting a world traveler's broadened horizons, one is instantly drawn to Vianne's witty, intelligent, exotic, and ecclectic personality.  She is intuitive to the extent of being a witch, yet uses her supernatural gifts for the good of the town (whom for the most part wishes her away at once).  Those villagers (whom I just want to hug!) who had the courage to befriend Vianne, find they are not dissappointed.  On the contrary, they find a beautiful friendship which they all needed more than anything.<BR>   Not only does Vianne inspire in her friends and customers of the Chocolaterie a yearning to be different, she gives them the courage to indulge, enjoy life, live a little.  <BR>   Although I expected a romance to develop in this story, it's not what one expects.  However, that is by far not its importance.  For that, one can go to Blockbuster and watch Juliette Binoche and Johnny Depp's romance in the film.<br />A very moving story with an exotic mysticism that will leave you entranced...A must-read!
0262731541|5.0|Disclosure: I am an interested party (contributor), so you may take my 'star' rating with a grain of salt. My main message is to make a point that I have also emailed to Amazon.<br />As of May 1, 2004 the other customer reviews posted for this title are somewhat misleading, because they refer only to the much older (second) edition. The third edition, published April 2004, is dramatically enlarged and updated -- a completely new book based on a tremendous amount of recent work. Dave Wilson and I have attempted to address all the issues to be seen in those reviews, plus many more, we hope successfully. <br />In this 5-year process every chapter was rewritten or even replaced outright. A great quantity of new material on history, physiology, speed calculations, aerodynamics, steering theory, human powered vehicles etc. is available nowhere else.<br />I encourage any scientifically curious cyclist, or bicycle industry engineer, to contribute a genuine review of the third edition, so potential readers can learn about this distinctly different book.
B00000JTB2|5.0|Two generations of blues masters come together in one dynamite CD...Austin's Stevie Ray and the Chicago Master, Albert King. Both left this life too quickly, King at 69 and Stevie Ray at 35 but their music will live on for future generations. You will love this one!
6304196784|2.0|Despite a couple of funny scenes (just funny, not really hilarious), this movie is average at best and highly disappointing. Some might say that &quot;A Fish Called Wanda&quot; is a masterpiece comedy, but frankly I fail to see what the hype is all about. Sure, there are a couple of quirky moments here, yet the plot is substandart, the directing is weak, the characters are not likable in the least and the acting shows signs of competence still isn`t all that great either. Overall, this effort is a mildly enjoyable cinematic experience that`s probably worth watching once if there`s nothing better around. Decent and tolerable, but a classic this is not.<br />Passable entertainment.
B0001ENYKS|1.0|Franz Ferdinand's shallow debut album is arguably the worst thing that has happened to Rock'n Roll Revival so far. If they're too lazy to give any meaning to what they do, maybe we should feel too lazy to buy their records. Who said danceable music has to be music of no importance? Buddy Holly, The Beatles, New Order, Pulp... All proved you don't have to sell out to produce amazing disco tunes. I wasn't surprised to learn that Franz Ferdinand took half of their inspiration from Duran Duran. Bands who make danceable music for the sake of it ain't what Rock'n Roll needs!
B00004TDTO|4.0|I think everyone will agree that this movie is a classic.   I grew up watching these movies and still enjoy them.   I think that it's a fear that everone has (The ocean, huge shark, broken down boat etc...) that's why it's such a good movie.   The special effects are pretty good given the age of the movie.   All in all this movie is great and will continue to be so for a long time.   Well worth the purchase!
0156027321|1.0|I'm totally confused as to how so many people could think that this book was worth while reading. I read this book in a book club. I was warned before I started reading that it starts out slow but seems to pick up. Well that certainly wasn't evident. The book started out slow, picked up slightly, and then just slowed right back down again. I found that I was not alone with my opinion when others that read the book said that they found it horrid and hard to finish. Even the leader of the book club did not finish it, I still don't know if he has, and this was 4 months ago! The philisophical aspects of this book are not nearly as powerful as the power to put the reader to sleep.
B00000DFTG|4.0|This set is a great collection of Sabbath tunes.   Both the first and cd are good.   Ozzy  and the crew really keeps the energy high on the cds.   Also the booklet in the cd has a lot of info about the band and their party lifestyle.   The sound is also good for a live cd.   I picked this cd up used on clearence for 2.50 and after listening to it I feel like I stole it!!   I would gladly spend the 23.00 for it new but to get it for 2.50, What a deal, pick it up it's worth it.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Great special effects.  One exception:  Near the ending when Ewan was carrying Albert Finney to the lake, the overall effect was something to be expected out of Smallville and not a motion picture, however, other than that the movie was awesome.  It successfully mixed fantasy with drama to great effect.  I strongly suggest you purchase the DVD as opposed to renting it.  There are no defects despite what the guy at Blockbuster wrote.  He is lying.  Hey!!!  Just buy the movie.  Then, just watch the movie and judge for yourself.  You won't be sorry.
0156027321|4.0|While Life of Pi is a tad slow going at first and a trifle abrupt at the ending, the uniquely engrossing tale in the middle more than makes up for these aforementioned deficiencies.<br />While I had my doubts going in and it did take me a good 75 pages to truly get into the book, I must say that once I did it made for a most inimitable ride -- one you'll not soon forget -- whether you love it or hate it.  While the story of a boy and a tiger sailing across the Pacific in a lifeboat may seem implausible, if not downright silly, to many from the outset (myself included), the whole premise of this unbelievable scenario is expressly central to the theme of the book.<br />In a society where religion is increasingly derided and looked down upon by many, it takes a 16 year-old Indian boy and the incredibly original bengal tiger Richard Parker to teach us the power of faith and reaffirm the existence of God - as well as the wonder of animals and zoos.  If in doubt, give it a shot - Richard Parker and co. will not disappoint.<br />\\"The presence of God is the finest of rewards.\\" - Pi
B00006HBUB|4.0|Mystery Inc. is on the move... they moved from bad scripts and very dated personalities on celuloid, to the big screen.  All I can say, is ... ITS ABOUT TIME!  Personally I grew up with the scooby cartoons, and really disliked them emensly.  When the film came out, I avoided it like the plegue... Who wants to pay too much for a ticket, sit in a chilled movie theater where your shoes stick to the floor, in a room full of people you don't know and watch something you aren't going to like?  I guess the answer would be me, a friend was visiting that was an emense scooby fan, and it was on Pay-Per-View, so we watched it.  I was surprised, at the movie, at my actually enjoying the movie, at me finally going out and buying the DVD.  As for the story line, Mystery Inc is breaking up, all but Shaggy and Scooby want more fame and noteriety... They divide to go out and solve their own cases, but all get summoned individually to an island retreat for college spring break clientell... college students turn into zombies (ooh there's a surprise), and the gang is forced to work together to solve the mystery.  Watch it, take it at face value, and enjoy.
B000005IU2|5.0|I got the vinyl in 1971. It was the best then, and the CD is the best now. When asked what CD you would want to have if deserted on an island, this is it. Let's face it, it's not as artistic or polished as the Who, or Led Zep, but it flat out rocks. Loose and TV Eye are the two best back to back songs I know of on any album or CD (Black Dog and Rock and Roll a close second). I'll admit LA Blues is a waste, but the other six tracks are primo. I don't think anything Iggy's done since measures up. His concert at the Harvard Square theater in 1977 (with Bowie on keyboards!) was the best I ever saw, and I saw Hendrix.
B0002234LS|2.0|Before i say anything else, if you have seen the recent film \\"Identity\\", and liked it, you'll have double the reasons not to like \\"Secret window\\" because they have exactly the same trick or premise involved, and whereas \\"Identity\\" is brilliant Secret Window is far from.<br />   In this, yet another adaptation of a Stephen King book, the tradition of his books not really working on the big screen goes proudly on. It may be the directing that was at fault, which delivers a film that drags along at points and never makes you jump (this being a thriller supposedly), and also which basically reveals what the \\"score\\" is from the very opening scenes if you were careful enough to notice. Even if not, most people i know knew what the trick was midway through the film and that can't have been what the director wanted.<br />   It might've also been the script-writer. I haven't read the book, but what i saw on the film script-wise, certainly doesnt qualify this as a \\"scare-pic\\". It never reaches any levels of respectable intensity and it never really grabs you.<br />    Nevertheless, the two main protagonists, J.Depp and J.Turturo are absolutely great, both in their own regards. Depp plays his part of a slacker author in a massive writer's block with brio and humor, and Turturo plays the cold-blooded sadist-killer from the south with equal zest and attitude. I, in fact, enjoyed Turturo's part even more than Depp's, and that while being a massive Depp fan.<br />   There's been a lot of films like that, coming of Hollywood lately, \\"who-dunnits\\" with a big twist in the end, and Secret window is definetely one of the least impressive in its category.<br />   Aside of the actors' performances, this is a film that's forgettable. If you do watch it, take the time and watch \\"Identity\\" afterwards and you'll see what i mean about their similarities and their grand difference in quality.
B000001C6M|3.0|Satan, satan, satan, kill, kill, kill, blah, blah, blah. This is how I describe this album. Kind of boring. =/ The guitars are good though. That's about it. =/
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|Avenged Sevenfold creates a unique breed of metal blending both screaming and singing flawlessly.  The singer is amazing at both aspects and the other instruments match up to it.  The guitarists put off great riffs and the drummer is incredible.  Piano is also included in some songs and they pull it off well. <br />Waking the Fallen shows much improvement from Sounding the Seventh Trumpet.  The music sounds more full and the singers voice isn't as shaky.<br />As for the whole, hardcore emo, screamo title they are sometimes given, I completely disagree.  Avenged Sevenfold is pure metal and I think its a disgrace for them to be placed in any other category.<br />Stand out tracks..<BR>Unholy Confessions<BR>Remenissions<BR>I Won't See You Tonight Part I<br />**Other than the intro, every track is amazing.
B00006F7S4|4.0|This album is awesome! It's the anti-&quot;Midnight Vultures&quot;, and ten times as good. I'm just amazed at the diversity of this guy. For the most part the album is very slow tempo, just him strumming and singing in an almost monotonous tone, but it also has a subtle layer of blips and beeps that give some tracks a spacey feel as well. It's a great combo, and does remind me of recent releases from &quot;Wilco&quot; and &quot;The Flaming Lips&quot; too. Most of the songs are great, including the excellent &quot;Lost Cause&quot;, and the opener &quot;The Golden Age&quot;. That song pretty much has me hypnotized by the time it ends. I can see how some people won't dig this, but those that do should totally love it. Great listening for the &quot;End Of The Day&quot;.
B00007LL7O|3.0|After a 3 year wait Elements pt.1 is a bit of a disappointment. It's not that this album is bad, it's just that I expected better, particularly after Infinite, Destiny, and Visions.  Jens Johansens' keyboards are probably the strongest part of this album, they never fail to impress me. The same could be said of Jorg Michael's drums. However, Tolkki and Kotipelto didn't seem to have their heart in these songs.  Honestly, if you have to choose between this album and Pt.2, buy Pt. 2.
B000002ITK|3.0|This is a decent collection of one of the 1980's most notorious metal bands, but it should be better. It only has some of their best cuts, and replaces what should be here with live tracks. I would suggest getting their &quot;Stay Hungry&quot; album, which also has their biggest hits, others that should be on here, and one of the best album covers in history. I'd take that any day over this collection. This one's still pretty &quot;Twisted&quot; though.
B000085RTZ|5.0|Wow, what a long way this band has come since &quot;Eternity&quot;.  Roy Khan's smooth prog metal vocals match this band a great deal better than Vanderbilt's vox did.  Instead of sounding like a poor man's Queensryche they now sound like a metal act on par with the likes of Savatage, Symphony X, and Blind Guardian.  Khan's vocals dominate this album, but that doesn't mean that Youngblood's mighty guitars should be ignored.  He manages to combine great talent for rhythym with an amazing ear for leads and solos.  By this point he's actually surpassed Michael Romeo of Symphony X as a songwriter (sorry Mike).  However, what makes this album a true triumph is the presence of so many great guest musicians, particularly the collection of Keyboardists and guest vocalists that add to the overall sound a great deal.  This is one of the best arranged albums of 2003.  A must buy for any fan of Prog or Power Metal
B0001RVTXO|4.0|This is a pretty good and generous \\"Pixies\\" collection. Also good because the previous \\"Best Of\\" called \\"Death To The Pixies\\" is either out of print, or an import now. Though this one doesn't come with a bonus live disc like the other did, it does include 6 more tracks. Included are the songs \\"Bone Machine\\", \\"Gigantic\\", \\"Here Comes Your Man\\", \\"Dig For Fire\\", and \\"Planet Of Sound\\". It also has one of my favorites \\"Alec Eiffel\\", and the Neil Young cover \\"Winterlong\\". Overall it's a great package of a true alternative band, and is far from \\"Tame\\".
0684833395|5.0|Catch-22 is one of those books that everyone ought to read, because it is so effective at chronicling one of the strangest sides of the human condition.  The book is hilarious throughout; the result of this is that it's much easier and more fun to read than most anti-war books, and the violence and horror are much more affecting.  Absurdist and pointed at the same time, this book is much more potent than many other more serious war novels.  Heller's writing style is not very literary, but it gives the book more of an urgency and a realism.  Everyone should read this book.
B0000027RL|4.0|For some people, this isn't just the best &quot;Pearl Jam&quot; album ever, it's the best grunge album ever. I'm not one of those people. I do think this is a great album, and it's definitely their most straight forward rock record, but I also believe they've released better since. They're also a much diffent band today than they were then. &quot;Ten&quot; may be the epitome of grunge to some, but musically it also reminds me of alot of the hair bands they helped to make extinct, much like &quot;Mother Love Bone&quot; before. Anyway, I'm getting off the subject. This is a good disc, full of many rockin' songs, I just don't enjoy it as much as &quot;Vs.&quot;, &quot;Yield&quot;, or &quot;Riot Act&quot;. I give &quot;Ten&quot; a 7.
B0001YRVN4|5.0|Hello to all! Before I even say anything about this DVD set, I will inform all who are reading this review that I am CEO of The International Alliance For Biggs. You see, what none of you can realise or even comprehend is that Biggs is still alive! You see, as the laser blast from Darth Vader's Tie Fighter hit Biggs' X-Wing, Biggs accidently hit the hyperdrive. This sent him roaring through space and perhaps even time... itself! (Thank you Dr. Scott!) Now, Biggs is now a cool Private I. who lives in NYC's East Village. He and I have become great friends and we often sit around watching that wacky Britcom \\"The Young Ones\\" whilst drinking Jolt Soda and making prank phone calls to Dirk Benedict (you've gotta love Starbuck!). Biggs himslf has informed me that he wants the scenes with him and Luke early on in Episode IV to be put back in as well as having MY band, Vader Vader (like Duran Duran but... different!), playing in the Cantina scene. He also informed me that if the scenes with him and Luke were NOT put back in SOME \\"Special Edition\\" of Star Wars soon, that he would hire Kuzak, formerly of the Law Firm Of Leland, MacKenzie and Brackman to sue everyone on the staff of Lucasfilm Ltd. for breach of contract and hurt of feelings. Just thought you all should know. Now, in the immortal words of Eddie Izzard... \\"Ciaaaaaaaao`!!!\\"...  Thank you.
B000002J7U|3.0|Although the opening title track is a bit derivative, Voices, as an album, tends to get somewhat deeper (and more interesting) the further in you go. The most provocative tracks include &quot;Come to Me,&quot; &quot;Ask the Mountains,&quot; and &quot;Losing Sleep (Still, My Heart),&quot; which feature guest vocals by the likes of Caroline Lavelle, Stina Nordenstam, and Paul Young, respectively.<br />Overall, this is a somewhat unusual album, melodically, and though it's perhaps not as readily accessible as Direct nor as prolific as Mythodea, Voices has a voice of its own.
0440238609|5.0|Phillip Pullman's Dark Materials Triology is a masterfully written set of stories that should appeal to adults and older children (I would suggest 12+) alike. They are extremely well written, and perfectly conjure up the images of the worlds and people that are the subjects of these books. While the messages are sometimes dark, and left me with an ongoing sense of unease throughout, I think that the \\"anti-Church\\" sentiment that some find in these books should actually be seen as a statement against corruption, for example the abuse of the position of power and trust that the Church holds in society. The stories are actually about the fact that innocence, love, friendship and faithfulness are what will save everything.  I would recommend these to everyone, they are stunningly well written (and should be read with an open mind). As for parallels with Harry Potter? ... forget it - these far outclass JK Rowling's books (which I also enjoyed), and are novels about childhood, not children's novels.
B00009W8N2|4.0|This album would easily be on par with Opeth's later albums if Akerfeldt had combined his melodic vocals more with the heavier growling. Opeth is all about contrast. They do achieve the contrast on the instrumentals, but it becomes much more pronounced and perfected beginning with the album My Arms, Your Hearse, when they include more melodic vocal work.<br />In the Mist She Was Standing (7/10): What a great set of metal riffs to start your music career with! There aren't any vocals for a few minutes as they band goes crazy switching from one awesome riff to the next. Like many Opeth songs, this one goes from extremely heavy to light to heavy again. The first lighter interlude is both beautiful and depressing. Like every song on this album, it is weakened a bit by the lack of softer vocals to go with the heavier ones.<br />Under the Weeping Moon (8/10): The minor key accoustic stuff that starts it off is a greater tension builder for the rest of this song, which like the first track has several memorable riffs. Opeth has the monopoly on great metal riffs. The fade out of Akerfeldt's growl into the lighter part of this song is chilling. Opeth often have a tendency to let the repetitive lighter sections go on for a bit long, but I usually overlook this because of the impact of the contrast when the heavier stuff finally kicks back in. The finale sequence is incredible.<br />Silhouette (10/10): Simply put, this is one of the most beautiful and brilliant piano songs written since the days of Beethoven. Throughout the course of this comparably short song, the piano deftly weaves with fluttering grace up through scales in ways which build to climaxes and then release. Unlike many keyboard solos in the wide-ranging genre of progressive metal, this one is not an exercise in speed or complexity. It has both traits, but this is by effect of the song, not the reason itself for the song. This is the best track on the album, surprisingly, but those who only like metal may not find as appealing as I do.<br />Forest of October (8/10): More great metal riffs. If they keep it up at this pace, they are going to run out of ideas, I swear. This is probably my second favorite song on the album. It has one of the few short sections of melodic vocals on this album. This is one particular song where parts of it really cause me to imagine scenes based around the title of the song. The first lighter section, in particular, fits very well with the idea of a casual stroll through a forest with brown dead leaves of Autumn all around. The second lighter section feels like the chill of the impending winter, and the lone guitar bit has a bone-chilling feel to it.<br />The Twilight is My Robe (8/10): This one has probably the best use of Akerfeldt's melodic vocals on this album, as well as some beautiful acoustic guitar soloing done immediately afterwards and later on. There are some interesting timing changes on the riffs here (well, this is true of the other songs as well, but I seem to notice it more here). There're also two amazing guitar solos that rival any guitar solo they've done on later albums.<br />Requiem (6/10):The second instrumental track, this one uses an acoustic guitar instead of the piano. It is quiet nice and does set the mood for the next song, but it doesn't have nearly the inspiration of Silhouette.<br />The Apostle in Triumph (8/10): First off, this song begins with an awesome acoustic bit which has a very climactic feel to it. It is the sort of thing which sounds like it belongs on the finale song to the album. There is a really cool instrumental bit ( violin?) around the middle of this song. It sounds evil, like tiny little demons jumping around or something. :-)<br />Into the Frost of Winter (5/10): It's not really a bad song, but it doesn't compare with the rest of the album. The production is very poor, and it lacks the finesse the other songs have. I should point out that I only bought this version because the original is no longer in print. Technically, this song shouldn't be here, so I'm not going to count it when judging the album as a whole.<br />All in all, that comes out to 7.857 / 10, or around 3.9/5.
B00005VEDI|5.0|Angela's Ashes recalls Frank McCourt's Irish Catholic childhood.  He and his family suffer disease, death, alcoholism, and poverty.  McCourt's style of writing is so affective.  It is a good memoir making each scene come to life. This book may be compared to other coming of age non-fiction writing, but it is unique in its setting and style.  McCourt's creative non-fiction style is strong.  It has both imagery and reflection.  The writing has great chronological structure and organization.  Because it is written from memory, there are some gaps, but it can still be read as stream of thought.  The gaps also make the writing realistic.  No one can account for every moment of their childhood.  <br />Reading this book was enjoyable.  It made me aware of historical situations that I did not have knowledge of previous to reading this book.  The writing is unique and compelling.  McCourt's story telling keeps the reader wanting to know more, even though it entails poverty and disease.

0783225733|5.0|1995's &quot;Apollo 13&quot; is a well-crafted and truly inspiring motion picture, based on the actual events of the nearly-doomed Apollo 13 moon mission in April 1970.<br />Director Ron Howard guides this project with passion. A passion that seems to be equally shared by each and every one of his starring actors on screen -- Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, Gary Sinise, Bill Paxton, and Ed Harris.  Plus, there's the ever-appealing Kathleen Quinlan, as Hanks' wife. Quinlan and Howard worked together more than two decades prior to this movie -- on &quot;American Graffiti&quot; (Kathleen had a very small role in that 1973 film, which starred Howard).<br />Three astronauts' lives hang in the balance during the last half of this finely-tuned film, as the Apollo 13 spacecraft suffers a major &quot;problem&quot; on board. An oxygen tank explodes, crippling the craft and endangering the lives of the moon-bound passengers (Astronauts Lovell, Haise, and Swigert -- portrayed by Hanks, Paxton, and Bacon, respectively).<br />Some of the more dramatic dialogue-driven scenes on board the spacecraft are fictionalized, but most of this film (from what I've been able to discern) is derived from actual, true events. With much of the dialogue between Mission Control and the spacecraft being taken (nearly verbatim) from the official NASA tapes and transcripts.<br />This single-disc (and single-sided) Universal &quot;Collector's Edition&quot; DVD delivers the goods admirably IMO, with very good picture quality, excellent 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround sound (with the rousing music score shining through especially well), and some nice bonus features to boot.<br />The film is presented here in its original theatrical ratio of 2.35:1. This is the perfect screen shape for this film, in my view -- nice and w-i-d-e!  And it looks great via this anamorphically-enhanced DVD transfer.<br />DVD Special Features include a very informative and extremely fun-to-watch Making-Of documentary, &quot;Lost Moon&quot;.  This feature, which runs 58 minutes, begins with a nicely well-preserved clip of the real three Apollo 13 astronauts being introduced by Johnny Carson on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; (circa May 1970). Director Ron Howard, and the cast members, add much insight into the making of this technically-challenging motion picture, including stories (with film clips) from rehearsals inside the KC-135 aircraft (a modified Boeing 707 jetliner) known as &quot;The Vomit Comet&quot;, which was used by the filmmakers to simulate weightlessness.  Interesting stuff here.<br />Also on tap on the DVD are two Audio Commentary Tracks (one of them by Director Howard), the film's Theatrical Trailer, and some extensive text notes.<br />This DVD package also contains a multi-page (fold-out type) paper insert, which contains Production Notes, Chapter Lists (for both the film AND the nearly-hour-long documentary, which is broken down into 13 &quot;chapters&quot; itself), and some photographs.<br />Plus -- Don't forget about the really cool &quot;Easter Egg&quot; on this disc.  Well, I guess you could say it's not really an &quot;Egg&quot;, being that it isn't really &quot;hidden&quot; here. But it isn't an &quot;advertised&quot; bonus on the packaging, at any rate. -- By just popping in the disc and getting to the &quot;Main Menu&quot;, you thereby get to the unadvertised bonus of the &quot;Complete Musical Score&quot; to the film, which will play non-stop to its end by just leaving the Main Menu on the screen.  Pretty nifty indeed.  An excellent idea, I think, for incorporating an &quot;Isolated Music Score&quot; onto a DVD.  I wish more DVDs had this nice musical feature.  The music score can be &quot;advanced&quot; to the next &quot;track&quot; (or music segment) by using your remote's &quot;Skip&quot; or &quot;Chapter Advance&quot; key. (You can only go &quot;forward&quot; in the score, however. The &quot;Skip Back&quot; button has been disabled for this bonus feature; at least it has been on my player.)<br />&quot;Apollo 13&quot; is a good film to re-visit occasionally -- and this well-done Universal Collector's Edition DVD makes doing just that even a greater pleasure.been on my player.)<br />&quot;Apollo 13&quot; is a good film to re-visit occasionally -- and this well-done Universal Collector's Edition DVD makes doing just that even a greater pleasure.
0486411818|5.0|The Finite Element Methodology though conceptually simple (eat the elephant by chopping it up into mouthfuls), becomes somewhat involved when applied, because the of tricks used to get solutions, after all you still may have to solve 100,000 PDEs to get your approximate solution to an otherwise intractable problem. So in its own way FEM can become a bit of a pachyderm itself.<br /><br />This book is very good, but be aware that this book is aimed at graduate physical-science/engineering students.

Never cliche, never boring, never sagging. Young Scout and her world is only incidentally in Alabama. It could be anywhere, anytime.

It has old dying ladies, missionary parties, hidden treasures, firing guns, friendly neighbours, haunted houses and all the yarn. And all the different things happening to her and around her, fit seemlessly as in real life, most uncliche-ly. I never thought any book could manage to do that. Harper Lee does an honest incredible job.

0425152251|2.0|I have to say that I did not enjoy this book at all. It was practically like reading a philosophy text book, and the story is a rather feeble and weak attempt to make the book interesting. I found myself quite insulted as I was forced to choose between reading the philosophy part and skipping the story of Sophie or viceversa. I recommend that if anyone is truly interested in philosophy that he reads the actual works of Plato and company.
6305609705|4.0|Apocalypse now to me means the darkness and evil of today. The heart of darkness of our society today is war in the context of Coppola's movie. Webster's definition of the word apocalypse is: \\"writing prophesying a cataclysm (violent change) in which evil forces are destroyed\\" (15). In the context of the movie this definition is true because Kurts dies in the end of the movie and all the evil along with him. I found another definition which said that apocalypse means the death of the world. This definition is close to Coppola's film because the film is about death, war, the loss of morality, the loss of soul, sanity and self. I feel that there is evil in war and in Coppola's movie, war symbolizes the death of the world, humanity, purity, innocence and love. I think that the title of the movie fits the story Coppola is telling. Giving war a face, showing it from another- dark perspective, what it can do to people Apocalypse Now is a success. Close to the end of the movie Coppola showed the words apocalypse now written in white paint as a restatement to the imagery. I don't think anyone could have came up with a better title. It says it all. The whole movie is full of shocking details that are hard to watch, all the blood, the absence of humanity and out of this world reality. Where a man can kill in the night without sight only sounds of the enemy almost as if it's a skill or a trade is unbelievable. Today, it is sad but not much has changed and maybe only has gotten worse. After 9-11 it proved again that the apocalypse of the world is not a fear but a reality. There is war going on right now as I am writing this and people loose their life and their happiness as close ones go to the other side. To me the word apocalypse gives me a notion of something so big, so strong that it cannot be stopped. I hope that's never the case in my time and in the future.

However, this was a far from decent film.<BR>I thought the premise was exploitative and the film should have been entitled &quot;Mr. November.&quot; People would have been justifiably appalled if a film had been made about a male character who found a different woman to boff every month and then dumped her. I found myself wondering if the story was a revenge fantasy penned by a woman who had been wrongfully dumped by some cad. I also found myself feeling bad for Reeves' character and wanting to choke Theoren's. Then I found myself wanting to choke me for making the poor choice to watch this movie. Next time I want to see Keanu Reeves and Charlize Theoren together, I'll watch The Devil's Advocate, which I would give three stars.<BR>If you want heartbreaker type romance, watch Love Story instead. Myself, I think I'll watch Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. I'd rather laugh than cry anytime.
1592400876|1.0|How easy it seems to be to fool people, with a book heavily hyped, about British punctuation and filled with errors and inconsistencies. Sort of amusing, but not very, and very, very wrong too much of the time. Kudos to the PR machine that created this - I only wish it had a sound basis in fact. Look to style guides, to Bill Walsh (The Elephants of Style), to Barbara Wallraff (Your Own Words), to the older Fowlers, to the AP Style Guide, the New York Times Style Guide.  Save your money on this one - or give it to your favorite charity.
B0001W8Q9Y|5.0|After non-stop listening to the double-album edition for more than 2 weeks now, it's hard to imagine myself happier than this with a new original record from my long-time favourite band. As with &quot;Anoraknophobia&quot;, I bought this album in advance without hesitation - but this time the satisfaction was undeniably higher. I've always regarded their previous work as a good and solid album but somewhat abusing on the extension of some tracks without any change of tempo. However, clear signs were there showing the band was, once again, searching for new musical directions and so it was no complete surprise to find out &quot;Marbles&quot; resulted so well.<br />This one, the official album, starts and finishes with 2 songs that may well be become two references of this decade's progressive rock: the opening track, &quot;The Invisible Man&quot;, and the closing one, &quot;Neverland&quot; - this one including a Major solo by guitarist Steve Rothery; the intensity &amp; beauty of his solos are back in superb fashion and that's one of the main keys for the excellence of &quot;Marbles&quot;. These 2 songs are probably the main evidences on the album of the band's highest creativity level since 95' album &quot;Afraid of Sunlight&quot;.<br />But fortunately there is more. Linking the entire album, the inspired and well achieved Marbles' sequence with 4 short parts - being parts II and III my favourite ones, but loving the simplicity of the lyrics on all. Track nr. 3, &quot;You're Gone&quot;, is another attempt from the band to reach larger audiences still maintaining their musical standards. It's very easy to enjoy it since the first listening if you're a fan of the band; the same idea applies to &quot;Don't Hurt Yourself&quot;. On the other hand, it took me more than one listening to fully enjoy &quot;Angelina&quot;. It's now the perfect song to listen to in the quietness of the night, besides the beautiful &quot;Fantastic Place&quot;. Finally, &quot;Drilling Holes&quot;, the fastest song of the album with some delicious chamber-music experiments on it, which presents Mr.h at his best - therefore, one of my favourite tracks definitely.<br />Discover a lost art - Play Marbles. What a perfect message they found out for promoting the album; get it and find out why. Marillion are still alive and kicking after all these years.
0784011176|1.0|What went wrong with this film?  Everyone involved has done brilliant work before and after this production, yet when they combined all their talent together they ended up with a movie that steamrolled the creator's statement over the characters and their actions. <br />None of the characters act in any sense other than to be moved as pieces on the gameboard for the writer in an attempt to say &quot;something.&quot;  What that something is is obviously supposed to make us sympathize with Hunter's character, but she is drawn as such a cartoon (a boorish, manipulative cartoon at that), one can never feel anything for her other than wonder why she is ruining everyone else's life around her?  Perhaps for the kicks?  It would certainly seen so, as she has no reason to even be in the film except as to create unhappiness for all the other characters.<br />If one wants a film dealing with the ability for the human spirit to rise upon inprisonment, there are many, many, MANY better films than this one.  One can only leave this movie feeling cold and depressed because it never is more than cardboardish, hateful characters doing terrible things to each other (including a clumsy attempted-rape sequence) until the out of the blue &quot;happy&quot; ending that seemed tacked on to help the bitter pill be easily to swallow by American audiences.<br />Shallow and desperate.
0684803356|5.0|Evocative, tragic, brutal, bitter. Using the Spanish Civil War of the 1930s as his backdrop, Hemmingway critiques warfare from the political abstractions and distant generals to the individual lives it destroys, and renders all in frighteningly powerful detail with every crosscurrent coming to bear on each character in ways that are viscerally wrenching, complex and yet clear. Every shade of character and dynamic is captured as several dozen people act out a small part in a large conflict in the two-and-a-half days of a mission to blow a bridge.<br />Robert Jordan, an American in the volunteer brigades, arrives deep in the mountain wilderness of Spain with orders to recruit and employ the services of irregular militia hiding out there in the vicinity of a small bridge that will be key to an impending offensive. His task requires that he win the hearts and minds of these locals in order to secure their loyalty so that he might have an effective small force for carrying out his mission. But this group of people are of conflicting feelings and understandings about their place in the conflict and what it means to each of them. Some are wary and some callous, some dedicated to the fight and others only dedicated to themselves.<br />We have real people-Anselmo's natural and true goodness, Pilar and El Sordo's dedication, Pablo's treachery, Maria's repeated loss of innocence. We have the politics and forces behind it all-selfish and hollow, or abstracted until it's no longer human. And we have warfare-sudden death, alone in the mountains, alone with your last thoughts, with the smell of burning flesh, with your last blood running silently into the dirt.<br />Hemmingway spares us the simplistic narrative style of describing each character's feelings. Instead, he offers the scenes themselves with such insightful observation and flawlessly rendered detail that every one of the many conflicting shifts of allegiance happening in Pablo's scheming mind is writ in his every gesture and expression and telling silence. Neither the characters nor the narrator ever need discuss these in so many words. The tensions among the characters as they huddle in their cave hideout are a fascinating web of unexpected assessments of each other, shifts of power and influence, tactical and strategic wins and loses. Though never spoken of, the delicacy and danger of Jordan's human task is clear. As a contrast there is Maria, at first seeming too childish until we realize Jordan's love for her is love for lost innocence, and that she in turn-only seventeen-has every right to her emotional fragility and her desperation.<br />And then there is the war itself, and here again Hemmingway's powers of observation and prose composition startle. Every action bears on every other, and the individuals are placed firmly in context from the cave to the local mountains to the whole of Spain to the abstractions of global political movements. Without a syllable of pedantry the author draws the relationship between each detail of individual action and the whole of the conflict. And vice versa, with ideals or their absence making each person's motives a little different, and often making helpless puppets of them all.<br />There is very little in literature to compare with For Whom the Bell Tolls. It sees humanity at its very best and very worst simultaneously, and sees it directly in vivid, glimmering images and beautifully textured emotional nuance, without wordy narrative telling the reader what to think and when. The fact that Hemmingway yet controls our understanding with absolute ease and clarity is only half of the writer's art. His critique of warfare and its human toll, expressed in Jordan's arc of hope and tragedy and resignation, is as brutal as the fear and blood on the ground, and ultimately contemplates the interconnectedness of life and the sacrifices made to sustain it. \\"No man is an islande, intire unto itselfe... Ask not for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee.\\" Among the finest literature we have.
B000006045|4.0|When I first heard Massive Attacks' Mezzanine I thought how wonderful it was to find such great music only to realize it was 3 years old and this was one of the newest albums!  Nevertheless, I was immediately drawn to the flow of this album.  The album, specifically, \\"Angel\\", \\"Teardrop\\", and \\"Inertia Creeps\\" are like intense, organized musical explosions neatly wrapped in melody.  It flows so well molding intensity and mellow together ... like explosive relaxation.  The other tracks are pleasant also, though not as strong the previous mentioned, but then again I prefer driven pieces.  Personally, I think the dark tones and base elements are the most important pieces of this album giving it a massive foundation for the entertaining '\\"bells and whistle\\" elements.  Overall I think this album rocks my socks off.

B0001HAITK|2.0|I read this story as a child and saw the Disney version and unfortunately, this version was more action than the rather cerebral/Freudian book.<br />First of all the special effects were incredibly cheesey and from ILM yet! Peter Pan moves way too fast for an entity weighing more than the bee he flies like. Didn't buy it. The trip to Neverland through outer space, didn't buy that either. Neverland was more like a place in a dream, a fourth dimention you might say.<br />The same actor playing both Wendy's father and Captain Hook (who gets killed by Peter) and then there's nothing standing between the two. That's rather spooky and you can read into it what you want. I don't want to go there.<br />This was better than the Spielberg disaster of 1991, but not much. Disney's cartoon version seemed to pass it on as what the author had in mind. Great music score though.
B000002BSG|5.0|Ok, so Jamiroquai has a strong similarity to mid-seventies Stevie Wonder. I dont see anything wrong with that, Stevie Wonder has influenced many bands. I wont say Jamiroquai is very original like some reviewers say, but they are good at what they're doing. It was refreshing to have some uplifting sounds emerge out of mid-nineties Britain due to an array of good but dark and melancholic music like Tricky, Portishead, etc.<br />One could say that Jamiroquai's lead vocalist not only imitates Stevie Wonder's voice but his lyrical character, this is true. But hey, if you're going to imitate someone, Stevie is a great choice. Differences from Jamiroquai and Stevie is that the music more dance orientated, otherwise it would sound like a perfect follow up to Songs in the Key of Life (except that Jay Kay's voice is no match for Stevie's).<br />I admit, imitations are not good, but Jamiroquai has altered enough for me to excuse it and to realize it's just good music.

0060523794|5.0|IBM should thank its lucky stars that Louis Gerstner, Jr. was there to save the day.  His strategic and complex scheme to save the country was utter genius.  In his book, &quot;Who Says Elephants Can't Dance&quot;, Gerstner explains how he took IBM by the throat and shook its economical and technological foundations until a dramatic metamorphosis occurred.  I liked the fact that Gerstner went solo to write this book because that helped me to understand what he was thinking when he made his different choices.  Everything from reintegrating the IBM management team to unveiling IBM's e-business idea was so precise in a book that lacks length (being under 300 pages long).  This book will inspire anyone with the hopes of being management material.  It's definitely worthy of a five-star rating.
B000002KHB|5.0|I just recently got this and only had In Rock to compare this to.  Overall, Machine Head has more solos, puts less emphasis on intensity (vocals and keyboards are not as dominant or heavy) but instead adds in the variety department...  the album is a bit calmer, but just as intelligent.  It is generally more upbeat, but does not let up in terms of musical perfection.  The double solo (keyboard and guitar) on Highway Star is very catchy and passionate at the same time.  Maybe Im a Leo has a very laid back, bluesy feel and a real cool riff.  All tracks really are fantastic.  Lazy has that classic, bluesy riff, with solos coming out of everywhere and Space Truckin' is more simplistic but has a real heavy riff for the time, and sounds very energetic.  Smoke on the Water is just a masterpiece period.  Basically, what makes this album great is the variety displayed in each and every song, as well as the songs' unpedictability, and how well all the instruments are orchestrated.  DP also displays a lot of passion in their play, they poured a lot of emotion into each song.  The production is cleaner and more vaired than on In Rock.  The only thing one can feel is missing from the album is just the chaoticness of In Rock but hey, Deep Purple is obviously a band that wants to progress.  I'm looking forward to hearing Fireball next.

B0001W8Q9Y|5.0|This is nothing short of a masterpiece. It is a musical journey you will want to take for years to come. If you have never heard of them, do yourself a favor and have a listen, you won't be sorry. This will be a classic, musical artistry at its finest. If you buy only one CD this year, this should be it!
B00005J6UP|4.0|I was not even born when this movie came out, but its awesome. It's one of the best 80's movies I seen and I love everything in it. It's just awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00004Y6O7|5.0|God...has it REALLY been that long ago? This is a benchmark album (CD) for me because I bought this the day I graduated high school 23 years ago this month! I saw the band in concert at the Civic Arena is Pittsburgh in July of that same year and I remember the packed house going absolutely nuts for 2 solid hours! I recall the backdrops used during both &quot;Mean Street&quot; and &quot;Unchained&quot; and how the whole show (music, attitude and visuals) just opitomised rock n' roll! Van Halen was big and loud and flashy...(did I mention LOUD?). <br />I rate the first VH album as a pure classic and still my favorite by far. But &quot;Fair Warning&quot; rocked more down and way dirtier than the three LP's the band released before. &quot;Dirty Movies&quot; and &quot;Hear About It Later&quot; are so raw and pure - and they haven't lost a bit of their edge in all the years since. &quot;Unchained&quot; is THE definative VH song to me. From that shattering and distorted lead guitar riff to the bombastic finish, it remains VH at the peak of their powers.<br />There isn't much more to be said that the other reviewers haven't stated so perfectly. I just wanted to chime in on an album that really marked an important moment in my life (much like KISS' &quot;Destroyer&quot; album did on my 13th birthday in 1976). There are always high points and memorable moments in everyone's life. And with my love of rock n' roll those most important moments are heard in my head and felt in my heart more than in any other way. &quot;Fair Warning&quot; has big teeth and is still just as good as it was the day I first heard it in 1981. And VH never (in my opinion) reached that creative height again...with DLR or Sammy Hagar. <br />EXCELLENT START TO FINISH!
B00000373U|5.0|i highly recommend this album if you like the honesty and passion of artists like john lennon, kurt cobain, or leonard cohen. you know what i'm talking about. elliot smith is one of the few that can touch me on such a deep level. this record has a sound of its own and it's truly haunting - even more so now that elliot is gone.
B00005JMEW|1.0|(This review is prompted by the ad to purchase that popped up as a &quot;recommendation&quot; from Amazon.)<BR>I gave a &quot;don't see&quot; review to IMDB on the film KILL BILL -- I guess I should have done the same on Amazon, too. (now posted)<BR>I almost walked out of the theater 7 times--but kept thinking it would have SOME socially redeeming value--eventually--it didn't. I hated the movie for its constant violence. I don't recommend it to anyone to see, in fact I use the film as an example of what NOT TO SEE! Can this director ever do a non-violent film?  He is so talented and if he broadend his vision outside of violence think what he could do!<BR>As mentioned, my comments here are due to opening my Amazon page and seeing a recommendation to purchase the movie. I was offended that Amazon thought it would match my past purchase choices. <BR>I saw the film and found it too violent, too offensive, and the fact that Amazon is now putting the ads in everyones face--I also find offensive. The movie glorified killing and violence... there was no socially redeeminng value to the story! Has the ad dept at Amazon seen it? Where did their computer get the idea that I ever ordered such violent films or have ever ordered even a violent book? Why did Amazon think I would like this so much that they listed it as a recommendation? Obviously, it must have been a general ad to everyone--which compounds the issue...not everyone will write Amazona about this. Multiply my letter by 100 or 1,000 that felt the same but didn't bother to write mazon. ( I also sent a separate email letter to Amazon's recommendations dept.) <BR>This is not family fare, not even content everyone should see--talented director aside. <BR>Viewing such violence releases negative toxins into the body that remain there for 4 days! Four days of releasing negative toxins toward the world. Four days of teens with an &quot;attitude&quot; parents hate. Look at the amount of toxic overload (negative body chemicals) teens get from such films or playing/viewing violent games, or even the news. Enough is enough already! I've asked Amazon's ad dept to remove me from their list for such violent ads. People should be asked if they want these ads in their face when they open up their Amazona page, or the day may come when lawyers sue media and advertisers over the indescriminate toxins forced upon the public. I can't turn off my opening Amazon page, it is not a TV/Cable channel. Just seeing the ad brought up all the negative crap and toxins I experienced watching the film. Amazon and this review are now on the receiving end of my negative toxic overload...day one down three to go. Enough! Go read a good book, like ISN'T IT ROMANTIC? by Ronda Thompson. It's a romantic comedy that will make you laugh--release positive endorphins and make you upbeat for days!
B00003CXUM|5.0|98 minutes of excellence. I am never a big fan for romantic films. Especially with the current scene filled with countless teen-or-chick flicks, I have become very picky on this category. I watched it with skepticism. 98 mins later, I switch off the TV in great relief, and also with understanding of why a few people do not enjoy it. <br />Generally, people who dislike this film have the following reasons: <BR>1. Simple plot and no plot twist<BR>2. Repetitive scenes<BR>3. Few and confusing dialogues<BR>4. No significant signs of intimacy or eroticism. Can it even be categorized into \\"Romance\\"?<br />One thing I have learnt from \\"In the Mood for Love\\" is also the same thing I wish romantic film directors would learn for a long time: Character Study and Development are often more important than unnecessary plot twist. There are pretty much only two characters in the movie, but by middle the audience could feel as if we know them for real. Thus we do feel the characters' happiness, pain and suffering. Yes, even if the time is set in 1962, Hong Kong.<br />The repetitive scenes do not represent lack of creativity. In fact it is one of the hardest tricks in my opinion. Although some actions are very similar, each scene has a subtle change in intimacy and impact for future relationship. Not one of the scenes can be taken away because they're all crucial links. As for the dialogue, it is few but every line is to the point. Each word is polished to sharpest and kept to minimum. Every word is a keyword.<br />Intimacy and eroticism are indications and eye-candy. Audience would understand immediately two people are in love. In my opinion this is director's point of view to choose it or not. Wong Kar Wai deliberately wanted to create a longing relationship without obvious physical contact to add up the sadness. In fact, the film has at least once \\"Implied Intimacy\\". ***SPOILER*** When Su told Chow she did not want to go back home in the cab, that \\"Implies\\"they would probably spendthe night together ***SPOILER*** <br />It could be artistic whether sex scenes are included or not. It just happens that WKW wants to present us a unique experience. I highly appreciate this effot. In the Mood for Love is a ten-level-upped romantic film and I definitely recommend it to every viewer, tertiary or not.
B00003CXCT|1.0|This isn't even the \\"special Edition\\" releases from 1997, these are modified versions of those!!  (look it up on the net if you don't believe me... there's a mix between fact and rumor, but this new dvd release will be different, can't the creators leave things ALONE?!)<br />Apart from a few re-inserts of the hairy beast from \\"Empire Strikes Back\\", there's not a reinserted scene amongst the three movies that's worthwhile.  The original revamped Star Wars was a cute fad.  Empire had a few clips put back in, along with updated fx that made no sense.  Amusingly, one thing they never bothered to do with \\"Empire\\" was to have the guy who played the Emperor in parts 1, 2, (likely) 3, and 6 re-do the lines!  What the heck?!  (maybe they did for this \\"special, special edition\\"?)  \\"Return of the Jedi\\" was a total waste; notably with the extended bar scene that made no sense, complete with using new critters and new music which did not gel when cut with the original footage.  Once again, were the creators mixing LSD with crack or something?!<br />The updated fx look nice, but are mostly pointless.  There's even a scene in \\"Empire\\" that makes it look as if Leia, R2D2, Calrissian, et al, are running on the OUTSIDE of a building when, in the original, they were clearly running down a corridor on the inside.<br />The point of the updated fx is to make the Eps 4-6 trilogy look more like the 'video games' that eps 1-3 are.  That's sad, as eps 1-2 (and likely 3) contain so many computer graphic images that any meaning (if there ever was any) was lost.  EVen then, eps 4-6 with the new fx still seem comatose to the vulgar, vomit-inducing business of eps 1-2 (and probably 3).<br />I'll stick to my ancient THX Laserdiscs from 1990, thanks all the same.  I like model ships.  They look real and look as if somebody tried to make an effort.  Computer images, while advanced, still look fake - and if I could see flaws during Ep 2 on the big screen, I'm going to see many more flaws on the little screen.  (...)
B00000JZC4|4.0|Mark thought the record was bad because the rest of the songs weren't like &quot;Take MY Picure&quot;, and that annoys me because that is just a music preferance. Anyone who clicks on the music clips can realize that Take my picture is the exception, not album's genre. For anyone who likes this type of music, this is a great album. Welcome to the fold is precious rareity, a true rocker that's intent isn't radio play time with a 3min. length and predictability, but a long song that spirals through great parts. All Marks seems to want is mainstream pop hits, but that's what makes this album so good, it refuses to mold to mainstream junk and remains unique heavy metal minus the satanic voice that so many heavy metal bands have these days, this is a band that I can still wait for a new album from since STP and smashing pumpkins both broke up. The review is suppose to be of the album, not the band, obviously if you don't like the band you'll hate the ablum. It's like going on to a Johny Cash album review and giving it bad marks for all the songs not being like &quot;Hurt&quot;, the NIN cover he did that is the only song that younger listeners propable know of his. Don't judge a band by the one song you know of their's, and assume that that's what all their songs sound like, just because so many junky mainstream band do so.
B0001Z53CY|5.0|First off I have to say that about half of these reviews people gave didn't acually listen to the album or didn't give it a chance. This Album is easily the best of the year and D12 is easily the best on the shady records label. The reason is because they have a style unlike any other rap group out there. Anyway my favorite mc of the group is Kuniva. Bizarre is the funniest rapper I have ever heard. Swifty is the best gangsta rapper of the group. Proof is the freestyle rapper of the group and Eminem is in my opinion the best rapper alive right now.<BR>Last I have to say is that you haters better open your eyes and ears and get your heads out of your ass.
B00008EY9G|2.0|This film had a lot of hype going for it. So when I actually saw the film I was very dissapointed. Now it'snot as bad as all that, but it's just another hollwood piece of tripe, thrown together very quickly in order to make an extra buck.<BR>John Cusack is excellent in it, which is very surprising since he had to get his tongue twisted around an awful script.<BR>Never the less, I did enjoy it for a while, but the end was simply crap. It was one of those annoying endings that could be the ending to any film ever made. Which is very annoying because it just felt like whoever wrote couldn't think of an ending so he just pulled this one out.<BR>Rubbish ending. Not particurlarly engaging. If you want to see a really good film, that's set in a motel on the road, then just watch Psycho.<BR>Alfred Hitchcocks Psycho that is, not that crap re-make.
B0001W8Q9Y|5.0|WOW! Marbles is an intelligent, thoughtful, haunting and soaring listen; easily their most powerful album since Afraid of Sunlight. There have been plenty of amazing moments for Marillion in the time since &quot;Sunlight,&quot; but this is clearly their most realized FULL album in close to a decade.<br />A great narrative set to some of the band's most inspired instrumental moments, Marbles has a great themes and an overwhelming message throughout -- just don't call it a concept album in the same way that &quot;Brave&quot; or &quot;Misplaced Childhood&quot; emerged.<br />Let's just say it's hard to keep from &quot;losing your marbles&quot; with so many things &quot;Drilling Holes&quot; in your head early and often... The fact that this band is largely a mystery to most after 20 years is beyond my comprehension. This album will put its arms around your soul and take it dancing.
B0001US8FI|5.0|Could someone who buys this please let us know what is in it that is not on the previous special edition DVD????<br />WB saw fit not to promote this, apparantly. I found no more info on their Warner Video web site than here.
B0001V07ZQ|1.0|The acting was a farce, as much as I like to look at Mr Crowe. He should have given this one a miss and let some one more capable take the helm
B00008DDXC|5.0|&quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot; is a worthy second installment in the film versions of J.K. Rowling's fantastic Harry Potter series.  Building on the foundation so expertly laid in &quot;Sorcerer's Stone,&quot; &quot;Chamber&quot; delves deeper into Harry's journey of discovery and danger.<br />&quot;Chamber&quot; opens with Harry back with his loathesome &quot;family,&quot; the Dursleys, the most hilariously despicable collection of Muggles one could imagine.  Frustrated by lack of any news from his friends from Hogwarts, Harry learns that Dobby the House Elf (a bizarre CGI creation second only to Peter Jackson's Gollum in execution) has been stealing Harry's letters in a vain attempt to keep Harry from returning to Hogwarts -- if Harry goes back for his second year, dire consequences await.  <br />Not to be denied, following a daring escape, a spooky visit to Knockturn Alley, a near-collision with the Hogwarts Express, and a rude introduction to the Whomping Willow, Harry returns to the beloved grounds of Hogwarts.  The new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, the vainglorious Gilderoy Lockhart, leaves much to be desired, but the good news is Harry is home.  <br />But something is amiss . . . students are attacked and paralyzed, creepy graffiti mars the walls, the professors are spooked, and to top it off, Harry is hearing voices.  Once again, Harry learns that his fate is intertwined with the sinister Lord Voldemort, murderer of his parents and foe to all that is good and true.  Accompanied by his faithful friends, Ron and Hermione, Harry seeks out to discover just what is attacking the students, eventually discovering the hidden Chamber of Secrets.<br />&quot;Chamber&quot; is a more mature work than &quot;Sorcerer's Stone.&quot;  The special effects are better (the Quidditch match is amazing!), and the tale is much darker.  Younger viewers are likely to be scared in several scenes, especially a horrifying encounter with monster spiders in the Dark Forest.  Butthey will also be delighted by the introduction of new characters, including the aforementioned Dobby and Gilderoy, as well as Moaning Myrtle, Professor Sprout, and the sneering Mr. Malfoy.  While you may wish that Professor Snape and everyone's favorite groundskeeper, Hagrid, had more screen time, the story is a delight.<br />The more militant Harry Potter fans may quibble about the slight changes from the book to the movie . . . but most of the changes are reasonable given the time limits involved.  (These fans are likely to be even more frustrated as the series goes along, since the books get longer and it's doubtful anyone is going to make a four-hour Harry Potter film.)<br />All in all, a worthy adaptation of a great book.<br />The DVD is lots of fun, too, and is packed with deleted scenes, games, and behind-the-scenes features.  The games may be a little amateurish for all but the youngest fans, but they are still a hoot.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|Bought mine at Wal-Mart on release date.  Booklet is in pocket.  Booklet is only listing of what is on each disk, episode title with small synopsis, list of cast members, several pictures, etc.
B0000DIXN7|5.0|Wow!!! this girl can blow!! What a fantastic voice. I have been in the music biz for 18 years and I have not been this excited!! about a new female artist in a very long time. I love her musical ideas they range from soft jazz ballads to funky Hip Hop inspired tracks.  I can't wait to see if see comes on tour to the USA. Hearing this cd makes me very happy!! I would highly recomend it.
B000003FMY|5.0|This is bar none the best version of Pictures at an Exhibition currently available.<br />While others such as Jim Svedjda argue that the Bernstein, (New York Philharmonic, Sony Music) interpretation is better. <br />I am compelled to argue that this recording of Mr. Reiner's work is closer to the what Mussorgsky was aiming for, having the right mix of Russian sentimentality and emotional power.<br />Don't get me wrong Berstein is a great conductor, but his best interpretations are of american composers such as Arron Copeland, and George Gershwin.<br />One final note while I may be dead I still know what great music should sound like.
B000003TA4|5.0|How can you say this isn't a good album? ..I mean sure everyones not going to have the same opinion on everything...but some of you are making it sound like Nirvana were terrible. Which they werent...might I add. There are some good songs on the album, and if you knew anything about good music you'd be able to admit that. And that thing I saw about Kurt rightfully being in hell? What right do you have to say that about anyone...despite what you think of their music?? And many people liked Nirvana so you honestly cant say it ruined grunge. Possibly you didnt like the band..but they didnt ruin anything. Keep in mind not everybody has the same veiws as you, and I don't believe many other people think they ruined grunge either.
B000002RXS|5.0|I have to say that Callas' Carmen is the most alluring, sexy and seductive operatic chick ever! She sounds fabulous as a mezzo, Carmen suited her well in this time of her career. Sadly she never performed it on stage. Gedda is still the best Don Jos on records and Giuot and Massard are fabulous, and unlike other more \\"famous\\" singers they sound French and idiomatic. Callas, who spoke French fluently, sounds absolutely glorious! Thumbs up!
B00003OSTN|5.0|Everyone who has a weakness for old movies should have this one in his/her collection.<BR>Steely Joan Crawford evokes sympathy as an abandoned, financially-strapped wife and mother, though you know all along that Mildred will make it somehow.<BR>Make it she does, stumbling into the restaurant business and making a success of it in spite of the fact that men find her so darned irresistible that she has to stop and peel one off every few steps.<BR>Adding to Mildred's troubles is the fact that oldest daughter Vida(played by dewy-eyed young beauty Ann Blyth) has become an insufferable snob somewhere along the line, in spite of her middle-class upbringing. Mildred worships Vida, in spie of the fact that Vida is moody, verbally abusive, and impossible to please.Vida wants to be &quot;rich&quot;, but when Mildred makes lots of money, it still  doesn't suit Vida because her mother worked (ew, yuck) for it. You wish that Mildred would shake her, or at least ground her.<BR>Eve Arden, one of my all-time favorites, is her usual wonderful self as Mildred's shrewd secretary and loyal friend.<BR>Butterfly McQueen gets wasted once again in the role of the family's maid.<BR>Even if you're not a Joan Crawford fan, buy this one; it makes terrific rainy-night viewing.
B00005JKC3|1.0|Horrible...one of, if not the worst movie ever made.  A complete waste of film and money. Two hours of my life I'll never get back, you coudn't pay me enough money to sit through this again.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Coming from the windy city two distinct sounds emerge. The more hardcore speed raps of those rappers like Do Or Die, Crucial Conflict and Twista (who appears on this record). Then you get the other jazzier, more laid back and sometimes social vibes of artists like All Natural and Common (who also appears as well). Somewhere closer to the latter is Kanye West. Kanye has recently become one of hip hop's leading producers and with this release he is looking to be thrust into super producer categories. He along with beatsmiths like Just Blaze helped to make Jay-Z's Blueprint the success that it was. He also helped make big records for artists like Alicia Keys, Ludacris, Twista, Knoc-Turn'al, Talib Kweli, Dilated Peoples and others. What was more iffy was his microphone skills (not to me after seeing him in concert prior to this release), which everyone can take a big breath for. He has a fairly unique soft spoken, mumbly delivery, slow but steady flow and tones of honesty and wit in his lyrics. Combining his MC and producing abilities with creative song ideas, skits that are actually funny, great quality guests and an overall sense of completeness and unity throughout the work. IT becomes with this one of the best commercially accessible albums heard in a long while and just a fantastic hip hop joint. I'll bring up some highlights now...<br />All Falls Down ~ After a couple of alright skits and a hustle type song Kanye gets fairly socially conscious. He paints vivid pictures of a single mother trying to get by through school when her degrees don't get anywhere. He also drops soem lines about the pitfalls of being in a materialistic mind state over following ideals and being true to ourselves but he admits he falls victim to it as well. A female vocalist repeats \\"when it all, all falls down\\" throughout the verses at times and throughout the hook. Kanye's production compliments the themes perfectly, which is made up of a bassline full of change ups, guitar strumming and an electric guitar riff to spice things up on the hook. Here are some of Kanye's witty lines he spits:<br />Spaceship ft/ GLC & Consequince ~ This is Kanye's bluesy memorial to his old 9 to 5. He narrates the racism and adversity he faced working in retail while trying to write rhymes and making beats at the same time. With his standard humour and his bids for respect peppered throughout his verse. GLC and Consequince (who?) Drop respectable verses about being struggling artists. To their advantage they have fairly distinctive deliveries. The chorus has a soulful vocalist talking about how he's waiting for his (space) ship to come in. The production shines again with Kanye using chop and cymbal filled percussion, dusty bass, and what sounds like sharp vibraphone or a light key loop.<br />Get Em High ft/ Talib Kweli & Common ~ Now this is a real head nodder. Kanye opens up with a firey lyrical display and he quickens his flow up at the jump off to grab the listeners attention. Then comes the chant like hook, then Kanye opens up the next very hilariously name dropping Talib Kweli to pick up chicks. Kweli comes in on the verse basically boasting and talking to the nightlife ladies while dropping in a reference to his Okayplayer fam. Then Common comes in and really stands out, with a raw battle type verse were he seems to get at Erykha Badu (their relationship recently dissolved). I guess we won't be getting anymore love songs from Com anytime soon. The beat shakes things up a bit. It has a programmed rather Neptunes-like feel. It also reminds me of a fun house with it's organ (?) loop and it's pounding bass and rhythm, a very high energy feel.<br />Slow Jamz ft/ Jamie Foxx & Twista ~ This is a song was a huge single for fellow Chicago native and soon to be Rocca-fellow, Twista. It appears slightly different on this album than it does on his. Jamie Foxx is given time to play around singing outside of the chorus, which name drops such acts as New Edition and Minnie Ripperton. Kanye and Twista's lyrical territory covers the art of lovins, while name dropping several soul and RnB greats along the way. The production uses sped up vocal samples (one thing that made him famous), wistful strings, bongo like drums and other fast paced percussion, deep bass and nice interjected saxophone, guitar and key flourishes.<br />Through The Wire ~ Kanye West achieves with this single certified classic material. The song covers all the required fields: a skilfully crafted beat, a catchy hook that stays in your head, quotable ish, humour and honesty while covering an interesting topic. Kanye uses a sped up sample from Chaka Khan throughout the song, a solid bassline that really drives the song, percussion full of claps and conga drums and kold string plucks. The lyrics are a the real gold despite the awesome beat. Kanye talks about how he got through his car accident that nearly cost him his rapping career, and how he surpassed it all even a jaw wired shut (hence the song title). The best way to express the dopeness is to show the lyrics:<br />\\"/I drink a - Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dizzert/<BR> /Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp/<BR> /That right there could drive a sane man be-serk/<BR> /Not to worry Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wi-zzerk/<BR> /How do you console my mom or give her life support/<BR> /Telling her her son's on life support/<BR> /And just imagine how my girl feel/<BR> /On the plane, scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till/<BR> /She was with me before the deal, she been tryin to be mine/<BR> /She a Delta, so she been throwin that +Dynasty+ sign/<BR> /No use in me tryin to be lyin, I been tryin to resign/<BR> /Trying to be a millionaire - HA! I used two lifelines/<BR> /In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died/<BR> /The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican man/ <BR> /Story on MTV and I ain't tryin to +Make a Band+/<BR> /I swear this right here, history in the makin man/\\" <br />This is one of the few commercially successful albums out that really deserves it's praise and phat cash. It's so rare to find such a skilful MC who is so astute behind the boards. He has just as much variation and depth as gloss and commercial sensibility in his beats and raps.Even The skits are pretty damn funny and aare not skipped very often. If you buy one album you hear on the radio or see the video on TV this should be that album. The record cover is classic too with a bear suit mascot, if that doesn't seal the deal I don't know what does. 5 stars classic album, pick it up or slap your self with a Nelly cd. Peace, love, and soul...
B0001HAHXW|3.0|although I like this album, the musicianship is top notch, I am disappointed in the lack of acoustic takes, sans band, of the &quot;traditional&quot; Robert Johnson songs. One would expect someone with Claptons talent to capture the bare raw essence of what R. J. was trying to give us.  Me and Mr. Johnson?
B000024MKV|4.0|With \\"G\\" (1996), Gotthard show that they have developed musically. Even if their earlier albums have been good, this one is a lot better. It sure seems as Gotthard have put a decent amount of effort into the song writing and arrangements as well. \\"G\\" is an album for those who love great singing and melodic rock without a layer of cheese. Especially singer Steve Lee and guitar player Leo Leoni shine, and the rhythm section is really tight. The music business is not fair which Gotthard is a living proof of. This band hasn't made it big and it's a shame because I know that there are a lot od people out there who would love this melodic and skilful heavy metal/ hard rock band if they only knew about them. I highly recommend this solid and strong four star album (close to five stars) and if you chose to take a chance on this album, you will get groovy tunes like \\"Sister moon\\" &amp; \\"make my day\\", speedy rockers by the name of \\"Moving on\\", \\"Hole in one\\", and \\"Ride on\\", heavy numbers such as \\"Fist in your face\\", a great cover of Dylan's \\"Mighty quinn\\", and of course a couple of slower ones in \\"One life, one soul\\" &amp; \\"let it be\\".
B0001HAISQ|5.0|This was the most overlooked movie of 2003. Great effects, great music, and great acting. It was overlooked but probably one the three best movies of the year. I think the child stars will probably become household names as adults - no silly child actors. And despite knowing the story line - it was still exciting and new. Dont miss it - a fantastic family movie - with or without kids.
0385336810|4.0|There were two moments that epitomized this book for me. The first was when Ken told Emma that they should call each other darling. I burst out laughing. The second was when the author expressed Emma's horror at walking in on her rommate and dance partner in the flesh-colored leotards. Fantastic. Great bits. Sophie Kinsella should have been a Sex and the City writer.
B000002AP1|5.0|This album will rock your socks off.  Every song is catchy in its own way.  Iggy Pop's best written-songs.   Great punk rock wailing guitar, solid rhythm sections, interesting arrangements. Loud and fast, and slow and moody.  Good-time Reckless abandon, destitute street rock... RAW POWER!  Outrocks the &quot;funhouse&quot; album.

B00000G28U|5.0|On disc 1 of Garage Inc. (Clean) there is a cool little censoring sound that is also used on St. Anger (NOT A BAD ALBUM as everyone says) but on Disc 2, they didn't use the same censoring sound. They used The Osbournes/Chappelle's Show bleep. You really don't hear it that much except on &quot;So What&quot; which is filled with bleeps. The Motorhead songs have like 1 bleep each. Listening to So What censored is so funny. I already know what James is saying because my dad used to have GI on cassette (back when those were still around) in the explicit version. Overall, if you are looking for a good Metallica CD, pick up this one, and get the edited version if you can, because it is entertaining and we don't need to hear all those cuss words!
B000148KK2|2.0|On CDs, Diana Krall's greatest asset is her voice.  Listening to several of her previous CDs and then to this one, I feel that asset has been severely compromised.  Whereas in Live in Paris and earlier albums, the music supports the singing, here, the singing has to compete for attention.  When her voice comes through clearly, the singing is as good as ever - but this is the case only in a few tracks.  Overall, this CD is a tremendous letdown.
B000001EAQ|5.0|This is an album that hit the pop market with a totally new sound and look, as they also did with the Joshua Tree, though the sentiment here is vastly different. For some reason, it didn't do too well in the market--instead, everybody went for the much worse &quot;All that you can take with you&quot;, or whatever its called. Strange, because this album is as good if not better than Joshua Tree. Musically, its at a level of sophistication greater than anything they've ever done--yet they make all that complexity work just right. They spent more time on this than any other album, and it shows. Fine work.
B0001M3MZ2|5.0|This is an incredible DVD collection. (...) Here's what you get in addition to the episodes:<br />Season 1:<br />--------<br />Production notes<br />- All 21 Episodes Including the Pilot<br />- Audio Commentary on the Pilot and First Episode from the Executive Producers & Director<br />- Deleted Scenes from the Pilot<br />- Interactive tour of Smallville<br />- Storyboards<br />- TV & Promo Spots<br />- Widescreen anamorphic format<br />Season 2:<br />--------<br />- All 23 episodes on six discs, two with commentary, five with deleted scenes<br />- The Chloe Chronicles - webisode investigations<br />- Faster Than a Speeding Bullet: The Visual FX of \\"Smallville\\"<br />- Christopher Reeve: Man of Steel<br />- Gag Reel<br />- Widescreen anamorphic format<br />The DVD set has some beautiful interactive menus and this thing is loaded with extras, which is unusual for a television show on DVD.  My only misgivings about it is that the video transfer for season 1 seems a little poor.  Not that most people would notice, but when compared to season 2, you can really tell a difference.
0316666343|4.0|This book has a terrific plot.  It is about young Susie Salmon dying and going to heaven.  Unfortuantely, she dies on account she was raped and murdered.  Aside from that grisly part in the beginning, this book is a good read.  The way Sebold gives life to her charcters is great, though the mother seemed a bit unrealistic and too dramatic.  If you can stand constant sex scenes and mention of rape, this is a good book to read.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|Master and Commander is a film based on the naval book [[ASIN:0393325172 Master and Commander (Movie Tie-In Edition)]] by Patrick O'Brian, featuring Commander Jack Aubrey during the Napoleonic Wars, as her pursues the French ship - Acheron.  Although it is based on the book, fans of the series should not expect a close film adaptation, as the movie is very different from the plot of the book (although it does retain some of its themes). Not only is this a great movie, but it is a fantastic DVD.  One thing you really notice is the outstanding picture and audio transfer that made it to this disc.  Even on my small 30\\" TV it felt like I was watching this in the theater again.  If you have a DTS capable DVD player, you'll really appreciate the Bruckheimer soundtrack.<br /><br />The extras on this DVD are where it really stands out.  This thing is packed to the brim with extras.  And I'm talking about quality extras, not a bunch of \\"music video\\" or \\"upcoming trailers\\" fluff to fill up the disc.  The extras are all entertaining, and fairly lengthy.  The shortest one on here is the HBO First Look, which is still 25 minutes long.  I almost enjoyed watching the extras as much as the film.
0767802470|5.0|This is probably one of the best war movies out there.  Some people describe it as an anti-war movie, but I really don't see it as one.  I see it as a movie that describes what happens to a submarine crew during World War II.  The crew is German, but they are set up in such a way that they could be any submarine crew from any country.  I wont get into too many details about the movie because many people have seen it.<br />However, the DVD is fantastic.   The 5.1 mix is awesome especially if you have a decent system that can utilize it.  During the depth charge sequences you can feel like you are there.  You can hear the leaking of water everywhere.  You can hear the distant pings of the approaching destroyer and feel the tension as it comes closer.  If you watch the movie, watch it in German with the subtitles because the English isn't quite the same.
B00005JMEW|4.0|So many reviews of the film, so my review is reserved for the DVD itself. The first thing I noticed is that it has some spectacular menus.  They were colorful and easy to navigate, and I even found myself just sitting back and watching the menus for a bit.  That however, is where my fascination with the DVD ends.<br />This DVD comes with 3 extras:<br />Behind the scenes featurette<br />Musical Performances by \\"The 5,6,7,8's\\"<br />Quentin Tarantino Trailers<br />The featurette is short, but very entertaining.  The musical performances are okay if you're into that thing.  I'm not, and it seems like it's just filler for the DVD, along with the trailers.<br />That's everything.  No commentary, no cast interviews, no bloopers, no nothing.  That's because they're saving all of the good stuff for the special edition DVD which will come with Kill Bill volume 2. THIS is the DVD you want to buy, not this thing.  This is just to wet your appetite and capitalize on the release of the second volume.  For $20, I want more than a 10 minute featurette and two throw away extras.<br />The next edition of this DVD should be out during the summer, so I would highly advise waiting until then before purchasing it.  Especially since this film is designed to be viewed with Volume 2 anyway.<br />Note: This review refers to the Kill Bill, Volume 1 DVD.
B000148KK2|4.0|Apparently, the joy of marrying the man of her dreams has given Ms.Krall's music a much needed dose of va-va-voom. I was a bit disappointed with Diana's last album, 2001's THE LOOK OF LOVE. THE GIRL IN THE OTHER ROOM, however, is something very special indeed. Sensual, meaningful, and vibrant, THE GIRL IN THE OTHER ROOM displays a rare sense of joy, and emotion, in Krall's voice from start to finish that, until now, has only occassionally been heard during live performances. With her life back on track, Diana has never sounded so incredible. The album is a genuinely heart felt collection, and is definitely Diana's most intimate and personal release in the history of her career. Overall, I say this cd is an essential buy.
B000067FP8|4.0|This is the amazing squel to the First Gremlins. It begins shortly after  the Chiness man recruit Gizmo.  A few years have gone buy the old Chinese man that had taken care of Gizmo before an after he meet Billy .  This movie has some fun scenes.  The weeding in the mens rest room at the end is hillarious.  So is the sense with Gizmo working out one when he is lift a  bar bell and falls through the floor.  Anothew one when he punches a punch bag and get hit back in the face.<br />The only  bad thing about the second gremlins is you see  Gizmo being tortured in it  a lot more than you did in the first one.  It has zany funny monments.  The part when Gizmo dress up like Rambo and makes a boy an arrow out of the close hanger.  The part when Bill is talking and suddenly the screen goes funny  the gremlin appear on the screen a do the shadow puppets is hysterically. <br />However unlike in the first one not all the gremlins is killed the one Female on survives.  Did i mention some of gremlins are genetically alltered by drink chemicals. One of the Gremlins    turns in eletricity and shocks and eletricuts  ever living creature he touches. <br />My favorite gremlin is the one that drinks some short of chemical that makes him smarter  allows him to talk in english.  There is some gore and   lot s of violence in it.  The scariest is  the spidger gremlin who ends up being huge.  He dies he burns to death at the end.<br />He was really mean to Gizmo and  is shown tocture gismo like Half a dozen times during the movie. The other Gremlins do not like gizmo because he is a misfit.  Unlike them he is kind and good and does not like hurt and playing pranks on other creatures.   <br />The nastiest parts in the movie is when one Gremlin acts Dangle Clamp and he forces it down a paper shreder were it is slice to pieces. She is gus us out of the shreder the lock like liquidfied spinch.  If you like this I recomend seeing Gremlins as weell as the Critters series which was enspired by theGremlins series.
B000067CPX|4.0|The Red Hot Chili Peppers continued to bring more great music with By The Way. This album really shows how much the Chili Peppers has matured musically in the last few years. The only negative about By The Way is that is that it isn`t as funky as previous releases.
B000001Y2U|5.0|This is a genre of music I know little about and like even less.  It is the first I have heard Marilyn Manson.  I only purchased it because I happened across his autobiography (&quot;The Long Hard Road Out of Hell&quot;) and found that so fascinating I was driven to try his music.  I am what most Manson listeners would refer to as Establishment, a middle aged conservative housewife.  In fact, I'm one of those that Manson wishes to make hate him.  He has failed.<br />I chose this album because of the description of its creation in the autobiography, and I find it to be completely consistant in tone and message with his book.  Manson is very clear and unwavering about his mission, and has woven it brilliantly into this record.  It is every bit the hard, ugly, utterly desolate wasteland that is his self-described soul, and of course, such pathos is the best kind of entertainment.<br />To those of us who love extremes, and can appreciate plunging to the dark depths as much as soaring the pristine heights, such intense music is very therapeutic.  We all have a dark side, and Manson treads into it unapologetically.  One gets the sense he is holding up a mirror to the devil in all of mankind; in Christian terms, displaying the Fall magnificently.<br />Now, being a hearing-damaged old lady, I will say that the slower, more melodious tracks are the ones that speak to me.  To the extent Manson tones down the screeching, the result is as sweet and heartfelt as any love ballad.  But as always, it is the lyrics that bring the emotion into the experience, and his lyrics are astounding.  &quot;Man That You Fear&quot; for example, is a summary in one song of all the tragedy that was his journey out of childhood and into the damnation he now feels.  As with &quot;Tourniquet&quot;, a bitter rendition of innocence spoiling to ruins, and the inevitability of the process (flies will lay their eggs), it is this harsh imagery that is so refreshing, as well as his honesty.  What else can the line, &quot;Take your hatred out on me,&quot; be but an open invitation to what society is obliging him by doing?<br />Even if most of the songs exceed my personal listening tolerance for &quot;shards of glass&quot; delivery, their lyrics are incredible.  Digesting this album was like going on a rollercoaster ride; intense, frightening, and exhiliarating.  I felt as if I had been changed in some way, which is exactly what excellent art should do.  This album probes into the very heart of spiritual angst, both on a personal level, and a social level.  He's made no bones about the fact he is on the warpath against institutionalized religion, and seems all too aware that without depraved ugliness such as his, beauty and goodness would have no meaning.  This goes to the heart of the question, &quot;why does God allow evil to exist?&quot;  The Christian answer might be so that God's glory can be all the more appreciated.  Manson's role as the AntiChrist can be seen not only in terms of slamming the hypocrisy of religion, but also as giving them exactly what they want.  In this album, he gives us a foreshadowing of the very thing they warned him about as a child; the horror of the Apocalypse.  He has virtually become the expression of that thing he feared the most.  This journey between extreme poles is another clue that he is an artistic force to be reckoned with.  Manson has consciously chosen the role of manifesting man's darker nature, that part which follows Satan, if you will, and this album is a fine presentation of his message.  If this is an exposition of the evil AntiChrist, we must ask ourselves a hard question:  Is Manson's dark world really evil, or is the album actually an indictment of sanctimonious &quot;good&quot; people?<br />But, as with the book, one doesn't need to delve into all the inner meanings to enjoy this music.  It has a deep, driving intensity that matches a person's need for introspective down time; music in which one can indulge one's more &quot;vulnerable moments&quot;, to borrow a term from the secret reversed intro to track 4.  On a practical level, this means it is perfect for when you're grieving a breakup, are enraged at being wronged, or simply wish to blast yourself with a good, hard, emotional listen.  I highly recommend this album to those who like this kind of music, or to the curious who can be very open-minded.re &quot;vulnerable moments&quot;, to borrow a term from the secret reversed intro to track 4.

B0001DI0FI|5.0|This film is the only accurate depiction of life aboard a wooden fighting vessel ever produced. In all ways, it should have taken all the Oscars. Author, Patrick O'Brian, may be the greatest historical novelist of the 20th century. Russell Crowe's portrayal of Captain Jack Aubrey greatly exceeded my expectations. I fervently hope that the remaining 18 O'Brian books in the series will be made into film with Crowe at the helm.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|I'll keep it short. If you need more just read any of the other couple of hundred on target negative reviews of this movie. How could a movie franchise that started with such promise come to such a dismal conclusion? As disappointing as the second installment was compared to the first, the third plumbs new depths of confusion, despair, and apathy. The Wachowski Bros. seemed to have studied at the George Lucas School of Bad Sequels. I suppose if you've seen the first two movies you may have to see the third. But be warned! Be prepared for disappointment! And rent it (as cheaply as you can), don't buy it!
B00003CXCT|1.0|These are not the Star Wars films many of us fell in love and grew up with in the late '70's and early '80's. These are the dreaded so-called \\"Special Editions\\" which feature new CGI effects which stick out like a sore thumb when they are combined with the original scenes. The Original Versions were not perfect, but the changes made to them did nothing but hurt the films. <br />It's a shame that Lucas has turned his back on many of the fans. Without our money over the years, where would he and Star Wars be? There would be no Special Editions or Prequels. <br />It is just so sickening how many people do not care about the preservation of motion picture history. These versions are not the ones that became cultural phenomenons and won Academy Awards. <br />I think it is great that Lucas is expressing his artistic vision. I have nothing against that per se. However, I am against it when he tries to cram it down our throats and expects us to shell out our money for it. This is the 21st Century. DVD will allow you to include multiple versions of a film on the same disc. Look at the Alien Quadrillogy Boxed Set for a great example of how things can be done. If he included both versions, everyone would be happy.<br />I will definitely have to pass on this release. I have the LD's, so I guess I will have to make DVD's of those instead. Lucas will not get another red cent from me until he wakes up and does what is right.
B00004TJWE|5.0|Beatlesque harmonies, Rolling Stones grittiness, Kinks humbleness, Hendrix guitars, and early Pink Floyd schizophrenia, and, what's more, lots of things that would follow on: listen to the flute rhythms in 'Private Sorrow' and tell me this doesn't sound like vintage Jethro Tull; listen to the aethereal chantings in 'Trust' and tell me Peter Gabriel didn't rip this off for a section in 'Supper's Ready'; listen to 'Balloon Is Burning' and tell me this doesn't predict the chaotic jams of Yes;listen to the 'love love love' chants on 'Bracelets Of Fingers' and tell me this doesn't render Freddie Mercury superfluous. It provides you with everything that, for instance, Syd Barrett could never provide you with. The Pretty Things weren't the only band to go psychedelic after the Beatles showed the way, but they were the only band that were able to expand the theme of 'Tomorrow Never Knows' over the length of an entire album and get away with it'. 'Nuff said.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|I saw this movie, and was deeply moved.  It was visually stunning and brilliant.  Easily one of the best films I have seen in a long time.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Television lost a wonderful show when FOX prematurely cancelled Firefly. I had watched it since day 1, and thought it the best television show out there, and still do today. This is Joss at his best. The plot was a recreation of the &quot;Wild West&quot; and cowboy themes, yet with an original twist. I still wonder what the Alliance was doing, after it has been cancel for more than a year. For anyone who watched it during its short lifetime, loves its creators other show's (that's how i got hooked), or is just looking for a unique series, Firefly is that. The best part are the unaired episodes, which might be better than those showed and the special features, which give me a bit extra of the show I never stopped missing.
B00004Z459|5.0|I LOVE this CD! I have not taken it out of the CD Player in my car since I bought it 3 months ago. I didn't know what to expect when I bought it, but it just grows on you -the more you listen to it, the more you will love it.  Trust me, buy it!
B000148KK2|5.0|The Girl In The Other Room is as good as her Grammy award winning When I Look In Your Eyes album. The more I listen to it the more I love the album. Almost Blue is my favorite song from the album and also like very much Temptation. The musical interludes between the vocals showcase some great musicians including Diana at the piano. As soon as one fantastic song ends on this album another one just as good starts playing. Liked the way her albums change concepts from album to album like The Look Of Love which to me is the best easy listening album of all time is mostly slow tempo type songs while this album has some much more up tempo songs like Love Me Like A Man.<BR>Have waited since September 18th of 2001 for her next studio album and hope I never have to wait that long ago again. And now that The Girl In The Other Room is out can enjoy the music she and Elvis Costello put together and I think the album is another winner for Diana.
B00003BDXG|3.0|There are some impressive cinematic moments in NBK. There are some great performances (know one ever really mentions Sizemore),musical score/selection aint bad. But it could have been so much better if the original script had not been dumped into the &quot;I'm Ollie the great.&quot; machine. <BR>   Look I like Stone from time to time same as most movie freaks (Platoon, JFK, Any Given..) but someone needed to slap his hand this time. <BR>  The original script is a great, tight, crime/action flick with some saterical undertones, and plenty of laughs. When Oliver was done the laughs were gone, I mean GONE, and the satire became a sledge hammer with which Ollie bashed us repeatedly. <BR>  Keep in mind this movie got picked on by Bob Dole(who hadnt seen it at the time), and Q.T.s won the Palme de Or in 1994. So what do think Ollie, you gonna teach that little Tarantino kid a thing or two??<BR>  Still having done some bashing of my own now, I most say thisa movie is on my list of flicks to buy.When the price gets down to about 5.00.
B0001BKAEY|5.0|I'll admit it...this movie is not for everyone.  The masses who went to this movie expecting for all of the answers to be fed to them surely left the movie feeling slighted...and perhaps mocked.  That's because the third movie reveals the trilogy to be what it always has been...A THINKING MAN'S EPIC.  (Nearly) all of the answers are in this movie, but many of them are hidden and require a good deal of thought.<br />This movie was also daring in it's willingness to escape feel good plot conventions.  Return of the King was no more than a series of actions scenes followed by a feel good ending where all of the good guys are happy.  Revolutions, on the other hand, mixes things up and doesn't take any cheap routes.<br />The action in this movie was fully deserving of the special effects oscar this past year, and the fact that it wasn't even nominated is testament to how political and catty Hollywood truly can be.  Again, the special effects break new grounds.  Where fight scenes in Reloaded depicting Neo in full CGI seemed fake at times, Revolutions has fixed the problem.  Neo and crew look fully realistic even at times where you know they cannot be doing what your eyes tell you they are doing.<br />The score is again great, thanks to Don Davis and ensures that the pulse of the movie never stops.<br />Finally, the acting is actually very good.  It has almost become a popular cliche to call Keanu Reeves a bad actor.  The truth of the matter is, this is his defining role and he fills it masterfully.  He deftly displays an array of emotions within the framework of Neo.  There are scenes (you will see) that are actually quite touching.  Fishburne returns again as Morpheus, a role that again, has defined the actor.  Carrie-Anne Moss again fills the role of Trinity quite well and delivers some of the movie's best lines.  And, of course, Hugo Weaving truly deserves high accolades in his return as Smith.  Again, a missed opportunity for a well-deserved Oscar.<br />Not everyonewill like this movie.  The truth of the matter is, those that like to ponder their movies long after they are over will find a vast treasure trove of material here.  THE THINKING EPIC OF OUR TIME!
B000000W5P|5.0|Unbeknownst to me, &quot;Some Girls&quot; was my mother's favorite song, of all time!  She'd never been able to find it, in stores, and only had a dying 80s cassette tape thereof.  Imagine my pleasure at finally finding this album!  What a great Mother's Day gift!
B000005JA8|1.0|On the one hand, the high numbers of 5-star reviews that characterize 1-star reviews as ignorant or from MTV viewers speak of a boring elitism, i.e. we're better than the rabble because we like this album.  This album isn't a litmus test.  You can hate popular music and MTV (as I do) and also hate this album.  It is a fallacy to think that just because the average MTV viewer is stupid, and just because you think you're smart, if someone disagrees with your music taste, they're stupid and an MTV viewer.<br />On the other hand, the high numbers of 5-star reviews that reference how succesful beefheart is and appeal to mainstream values of success (e.g. references to beefheart's paintings that go for x number of dollars, how this album has been in print for x number of years, how x number of cool people think the album is cool) serve to suggest that beefheart fans are indeed very insecure about this album and want desperately to be accepted just like the MTV chumps.  <br />Further, every time beefheart fans attack a 1-star review as poor or stupid, they fail to bring up any points about the actual substance of this album (or lack thereof).  You may disagree with others' reviews, but it is meaningless to assert that people are somehow missing the point by not liking it.  When beefheart is quoted as saying that he set out to create the most unlistenable garbage imaginable, it doesn't strike me as the sort of thing that would lead to a good album.  I'm not certain, but allow me to assert that it's at least possible that this album is intentionally bad and devoid of substance.  Lester Bangs frequently complements beefheart for this album, but here's a Lester Bangs quote that might put his praise in context: &quot;If somebody told me that some new group was nothing but a bunch of horrible atonal noise, I'd be the first in line for tickets.&quot;  Bangs, just like the other beefheart fans it seems, just listens to this &quot;music&quot; specifically because other people don'tlike it.  If you're listening to a certain style of music specifically because other people don't like it, then you're no better than people who listen to a certain style of music specifically because other people DO like it.  If you like the album on its own, so be it, but I find that to be impossible.<br />Here are the specific reasons that the album is pure chicanery:<br />First, beefheart plays two saxophones at once during one of the songs.  No one can do this and have it sound like anything but nonsense.  <br />Two, beefheart admittedly refused to listen to headphones during the recording, so he is playing absolutely independently of the band.  All of the claims about it being in some brilliantly complex time signatures are impossible, as beefheart wasn't playing at all in relation to the other musicians.  It's just chaotic noise.<br />Three, beefheart admitted that he was trying to create unlistenable garbage.  What else can I add to this?  HE WAS TRYING TO MAKE BAD MUSIC!  He admitted it!  I say &quot;Fool me once, shame on you, but if I pretend to enjoy being fooled, shame on me&quot;.<br />Fourth, and probably most important to me, this album is just terrible.  It's chiefly comprised of the sort of random studio clips, bad outtakes, false starts, poorly-recorded odds and sods, and meaningless chatter of which every musician has a drawer full but is justifiably embarrassed to bring to light.  It's not a coherent album at all, and reeks of carelessness.<br />If the beefheart fans want to keep pretending that it's a brilliant album, I'm not going to try to stop them.  However, I would be amiss to let an album this devoid of musicality go without some criticism.<br />Please believe me.  This album is unbelievably bad.  Listen to the samples, check it out from the library, or borrow it from a friend, but don't buy it without knowing what you're getting into.
014100018X|5.0|This was an enchanting tale of a mother daughter duo that was able to come into a quaint French town and transform many of the village people.  This story was enticing because it showed realistic community struggles during the Lenten season which  affected all the people.  The details of each bonbon created are irresistable and you must have a supply of chocolate at hand while reading. Harris did a wonderful job with the portrayal of Vianne, a mother who was able to help all who came to her shop, not just to buy chocolates.  This novel is all inclusive from stories of the river gypsies and the Catholic Church to the problems with sin and temptation.  Chocolat is an easy read yet there are a number of characters that are well developed and have major parts throughout the entire novel. I would recommend the movie but not until you have read the book.  However, there are many differences and the movie portrays the main characters in a different light.

1592400876|1.0|The author is caught in the ugly spot of not really knowing her audience well. As plenty of other posters have noted, this is a book on grammar, marketed to American readers, but set according to a strange hybrid American-British style. It's bad news when a book representing the &quot;zero tolerance approach to punctuation&quot; encourages errors by example (I'm thinking here particularly of the punctuation of quotes, which in addition to following neither American nor British convention aren't even internally consistent). The book contains some interesting trivia and history, but this content tends to be submerged under the deluge of grade-school level examples of how &quot;its&quot; and &quot;it's&quot; are to be used. Give me a break. Yes, I'm interested in the history and evolution of punctuation. But I'm not interested in wading through ten pages of &quot;apostrophes for dummies&quot; to get to one good page on Thurber, Ross, and the Oxford comma.<br />Sorry. It just doesn't cut the mustard. If the goal was to write a primer, write a primer. Maybe add a few more pictures of pandas. Otherwise, lose the training wheels.
0060934719|5.0|This is the second Neil Gaiman book I've had the pleasure of reading - the first was American Gods. While I found American Gods interesting and quite entertaining, Stardust I found I could not put down until I finished it.<br />Like American Gods, Stardust would make a great graphic novel (I would be surprised if it has not already been done) or movie. Gaiman is very graphic in his descriptions of situations and although I am no poet by any measure, I felt that there was almost a poetic quality about the whole story - the definitely is a good dose of poetic justice (of sorts)in the story itself.<br />The story itself is uncomplicated. One, of course, cannot help but liken it to a fairy tale, but I think I would be better classified as a story about every young man's journey into adulthood and all its attendant heartaches, magic and lessons. That it was set in the realm of folklore and legends only makes it all the more interesting. I won't go into the details of the story (many reviewers here have done that already), but I would like to say that I must have cheered aloud when the hero won over the damsel (who was not in so much of distress as he probably was) and in true fairy tale tradition they lived happily thereafter (not ever after, since the story is also quite well grounded in a logic - of sorts).<br />I would strongly recommend this book!
0553208845|5.0|There are times in life when we begin to contemplate our existence and meditate upon our destinies. The book Siddhartha explores these moments that we all share in the form of one man's quest for truth, divinity, and the holy Om. We follow a young man, siddhartha, through many stages of his life: intellectualism, pleasures of the flesh, acquisitiveness, etc.<br />\\"Om is the bow, the arrow is the soul, Brahman is the arrow's goal At which one aims unflinchingly\\"<br />We are introduced to Siddhartha, when he is a young Brahmin, who appears content to anyone who looks upon him, but fights an internal struggle to attain his own sense of Nirvana. Siddhartha embarks on his journey by joining the Samana, a group of priests who deny themselves all worldly possessions and devote themselves to the quest for nirvana.<br />&quot;Siddhartha had one single goal-to become empty, to become empty of thirst, desire, dreams, pleasure and sorrow-to let the Self die.&quot;<br />This did not satisfy Siddhartha's need, why deny the Self pleasure? He developed a lust for a life filled with joy and complacency. Siddhartha attains this goal and yet is still not content. He resents the greed and power that overcomes him. Siddhartha finds himself itching for money; he begins playing games such as dice- a game that he originally saw folly in.<br />\\"The world had caught him; pleasure, covetousness, idleness, and finally also that vice that he had always despised and scorned as the most foolish- acquisitiveness. Property, possessions and riches had also finally trapped him. They were no longer a game and a toy; they had become a chain and a burden. Siddhartha wandered along a strange, twisted path of this last and most base declivity through the game of dice\\"<br /> His journey next takes him to a river. At this river, Siddhartha nearly takes his own life.  Rather than commit suicide, Siddhartha finds a home on the River, the River becomes his source of inner reflection. Siddhartha teaches himself to listen to what the river has to tell him, and in this, hears the answers that he coveted in his many years of searching. The river provides the climax to Siddhartha's contemplation of the mysteries of the universe.<br />\\"When Siddhartha listened attentively to this river, to the song of a thousand voices; when he did not bind his soul to any one particular voice and absorb it in his Self, but heard them all, the whole, the unity; then the great song of a thousand voices consisted of one word:<br />Om-perfection.\\"<br />The book forces you to ask more questions, than it cannot, in itself, answer. What is the meaning of our existence? Is it possible for us to ever really find true joy? This book provides insight to the world of eastern mysticism. I found it an extremely profound and enlightening book that will most definitely change your way of thinking upon reading it. Hermann Hesse uses remarkable descriptions. This book will linger in your mind for a lifetime.<br />\\"From a remote part of his soul, from the past of his tired life, he heard a sound. It was one word, one syllable, which without thinking he spoke indistinctly, the ancient beginning and ending of all Brahmin prayers, the holy Om, which had the meaning of `The Perfect One' or `Perfection'\\"lf to listen to what the river has to tell him, and in this, hears the answers that he coveted in his many years of searching.

B00004YA66|5.0|This movie is quite an intricate story.  It begins explosively, settles you into the main characters and who they are, and then the science fiction weaves its way into the story line.  Quite original thinking behind this story.<br />Dennis Quaid plays a heroic fireman and a loving husband and father in the past.  James Caviezel portrays his adult son in the future.  James Caviezel character is tragic, sad because he misses his father who died in a fire when he was young.  The story affords James' character to save Dennis by telling him how he would die and how to avoid it.  How does he communicates with his dead father?  Watch the film.  It's quite simple.  By doing so, the consequences goes beyond what they imagined, and the story really takes off from that point on.<br />The story is great for popcorn on the sofa at home.  It is heartwarming, exciting, and smartly written.  I recommend for enthusiast of intricate story telling and acting.<br />Thanks.
B0000024JA|4.0|I can't believe some of the bad reviews I've been reading from this album. I even had a friend tell me Tical 2 was better than this.  I think people were expecting more of a &quot;M-E-T-H-O-D Man&quot; vibe throughout the album.  It's definitely not the best Wu-Tang solo, but it was the first solo joint. Now that was monumental in itself.  It's still a Wu classic and his best album to date.
B0001HAISG|5.0|I didn't see it in theater, but I heard good things about it from critics and viewers alike. I enjoyed this film way more than I thought possible for a nineteen-year-old male. The visual effects are colorful and cartoony which really adds a magical dimension to the film. All the acting is cutesy at times, but for the most part very good. Jason Isaacs is great as Captain Hook and doesn't play him too over the top as Dustin Hoffman did in &quot;Hook.&quot; The guy who plays Smee was very funny as well (the scene with the old peg-leg bird screaming in his ear always makes me laugh). This is a great film for the whole family even though it is a bit dark at times, such as, the demonic mermaids and Hook shooting his fellow pirates constantly. The soundtrack was very well done as well, and adds the finishing touch of magical feel to this truly accurate adaptation of Peter Pan.
B0000024LN|5.0|Pre-1998 was the last we saw of &quot;Funk Doctor Spock&quot; and &quot;Johnny Blaze&quot;.  Of course, they've become mainstream and commercialized and their music reflects that.  This however was before the height of Redman's popularity, which probably explains the difference between &quot;Whatever Man&quot; &amp; &quot;Let's Get Dirty&quot;.  E-Dub handles the production flawlessly.  It's amazing how far E-Dub has fallen off too, but that is not the issue at hand.  The funk master beats combined with Redman's witty flow makes for an enjoyable, gritty, yet funny classic.  Note to all rappers aspiring to be actors, please learn from your predecessors.
B00005AAFS|5.0|When I first bought my first rammstein record it was when Seinsucht came out and loved it, when I heard this album it never left the player... Well since then years have gone by and I have since grown into different metallic tastes... However, this album remains close at hand, and although not quite played as much, threw it on the other day and even though unavoidably a bit nostalgic, is still every bit as satisfying, fresh and heavy as it was when I first took the cellophane off of it years ago in the Best Buy parking lot... A classic album that will be enjoyed for many years to come, regardless of what trends may come and go...
078322740X|4.0|I wish more projects were assembled for this tag-team of born screwball comedy geniuses, because \\"Housesitter\\" offers a great display of how well  Martin and Hawn work together onscreen.  Their senses of timing are tremendous and both have a gift for physical comedy and wringing the best out of every line of dialogue.  I disagree with the original Amazon staff reviewer (I believe the \\"official\\" Amazon review has since changed to a more positive judgment), I think this movie is very well constructed, with a tight plotline and just the right balance of jokes and exposition.  Not a word  or scene is wasted.  The humor is  absurdist but good-natured, as in older-style films, and the supporting cast does standout service.  This is a very underrated comedy, in my view, and I give it a high recommendation for fans of either of these fine actors or zany comedy in general.  A very refreshing change from in-you-face gross-out jokes and sophomoric scatalogical/sexual put-down gags that pass as \\"comedy\\" in so many films today. \\"Housesitter\\" just zips and zings along from one wild confrontation to another as the teetering house of lies constructed by Hawn (at first) and then Martin becomes ever-more unwieldy and incoherent.  Dana Delany plays a prim, preppy \\"third wheel\\" character with aplomb and the finale is  satisfying, funny,  and endearing.  Hugely entertaining and stands up tremendously well to repeated viewings!
B000001FKY|5.0|Ok, this cd was a staple to my 5th through 7th grade years...As far as 80's bands go, I can't really think of one thats more listenable or enjoyable than Def Leppard. They just had a sound that was different from all of the other \\"hair\\" bands out there. Great melodies that just made the hair on your arms stand up and a grin come to your face. They wrote good songs, unlike most bands of that era that were just jumping on the bandwagon... I always think of the super himalaya at the fair(that ride that just went around in a circle super fast, like a roller coaster that only went in a bean pattern)...they must have played it that one and only time I rode that deathtrap, and i know I only rode that thing once because shortly after I did, rumours began to circulate about the girl that got her scalp ripped off while riding it...Def Leppard will do that to you!!! Comeonayeah-haaaaaaaa!!!!
B00005NKKZ|5.0|This was the last album by Simon &amp; Garfunkel, and perhaps the best.  <br />The most famous songs here are the title track and &quot;The Boxer&quot;, both recognized classics. The remainder of the album varies between driving rock songs and gentler, more reflective songs that point back to the duo's folk origins.<br />In the first category are &quot;Keep the Customer Satisfied&quot; and &quot;Baby Driver&quot;, both cheerful, fun, and silly.  The cover of the &quot;Everly Brothers' &quot;Bye Bye Love&quot; is nice enough, but adds little - it's a weaker song than most of the originals on the album and the cover is no better than the original version.  The only thing distinctive about it is that it is the only live performance on an album that was originally released as entirely studio recordings.  &quot;Cecilia&quot; was released as a popular single, but has never appealed to me.<br />The slower songs are more thoughtful and often beautiful, generally songs of loss and sorrow that seem to reflect the collapse of the artists' relationship.  These include the lovely &quot;So Long Frank Llloyd Wright&quot;,  &quot;The Only Living Boy in New York&quot;, and the sad, but ultimately hopeful &quot;El Condor Pasa&quot;.<br />&quot;Song for the Asking&quot; is a somewhat weaker tune, but not without its merits.  &quot;Why Don't You Write Me&quot;, which was on the original album, could be dropped with little loss, and the bonus track, &quot;Feuilles-O&quot;, isn't much of a bonus at all.<br />Overall, this is a beautiful album with numerous good songs and some great ones.
B00004TH6O|4.0|Ok, this CD was stolen from me out of my girlfriends car...pissed me off!! But if they had to get one of my QOTSA cd's I guess I'm kinda sorta glad they didn't get &quot;songs for the deaf&quot; or &quot;self titled&quot; which are a little better. BUT STILL!!! I loved that F'n album as I do all my music...the only reason I gave this 4 and a half stars is because it's just a teeny weeny bit less better than the other two QOTSA albums...However,&quot;Monsters in the Parasol&quot; is probably one of my top ten fav songs by QOTSA, so all you thieves out there can lick my chode!!!
B00005LOUS|4.0|That was Jim Carrey in that costume?  I don't think anyone could have pulled it off better, but for me, Taylor Momsen, who played Cindy Loo Who, was the most enjoyable to watch.  What a gifted little actress.  Christine Baranski and Molly Shannon, both musically-inclined favorites of mine, also danced across the screen.<br />So this isn't exactly the same storyline as the one penned by the good doctor himself.  But it is very close, with some details added in to give adults a few more chuckles.<br />And if you like it for nothing else, you will love the fantasy world created by some outstanding set and costume design; terrific old and new music; and vivid special effects.<br />Worth a viewing or two for all of you Who's.
1592400876|5.0|Does anyone else who really knows what they're talking about find it entertaining that the majority of negative reviews for this book contain punctuation errors?<br />I'd also like to give Ms. Truss a hug for dressing down the movie title &quot;Two Weeks Notice&quot; in a television interview.  Seeing that title made me cringe.<br />Folks, there is no difference between where Brits and Americans are supposed to put a colon, a semicolon, a comma or an apostrophe.  The humor may seem a little odd to some, but the information is solid.  If the language bothers you that much, purchase both this book and a subscription to BBC America for some perspective.
B000083E79|5.0|Never the biggest Cher fan, I was stunned by the droves of people across the country clamoring to her Farewell Tour concert.  I never had much interest, although I'm sure she put on a good show.<br />Then I saw this CD.  Sure are a lot of hits on it, so I put it in the CD player and was whisked away.<br />Aha!  That is why Cher's fans said farewell numerous times!  It's all explained in a FANTASTIC best hits album with twenty-one (!!) songs on it.<br />From &quot;Dark Lady&quot; to her remake of the &quot;Shoop Shoop Song&quot; from Mermaids, there is not one song that didn't have me singing.<br />There it is.  I'm a Cher fan now.<br />So I must whole-heartedly recommend this album to fans and not-yet-fans alike, because it is packed with her best stuff.<br />See you at the next Farewell concert...
B00000I07Q|3.0|&quot;New Jersey&quot; is a good album, but not groundbreaking or earthshattering as some seem to view it.  It might have been more successful than &quot;Slippery When Wet,&quot; but that's probably due in large to the fact that &quot;Slippery&quot; did so well before it was released.  In essence, &quot;New Jersey&quot; is one part &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot; and one part &quot;Keep The Faith.&quot;<br />If you listen to the album, you'll notice that many of the songs echo or repeat songs from &quot;Slippery.&quot;  &quot;Bad Medicine&quot; hearkens back to &quot;You Give Love A Bad Name.&quot;  &quot;Lay Your Hands On Me&quot; is played in the same vein as &quot;Let It Rock.&quot;  &quot;I'll Be There For You&quot; simply grabs on to the success of &quot;Never Say Goodbye.&quot;  Bon Jovi merely took the old formula, rehashed it, and created a good rock album that continues what &quot;Slippery&quot; started.  I'm not knocking the album for that because &quot;if it ain't broke, don't fix it.&quot;  However, a little more originality and, perhaps, a little risk might have made this album better than it is.<br />Other songs on the album, notably &quot;Living In Sin&quot; and &quot;Wild Is The Wind,&quot; show us the softer leanings of Bon Jovi found on every single album put out after &quot;New Jersey.&quot;  &quot;New Jersey&quot; is pivotal in that aspect, but it doesn't deserve as much respect as &quot;Slippery When Wet.&quot;<br />As far as the songs are concerned as a whole, there are a few good ones here.  &quot;Bad Medicine&quot; is the best song on this album.  It stands out more than anything else found here.  &quot;99 In The Shade,&quot; &quot;Love For Sale,&quot; and &quot;Lay Your Hands On Me&quot; are good as well.  Once again, these songs have that retread feel to them, but they are worth listening to.  &quot;I'll Be There For You&quot; is considered by many to be THE ballad when it comes to Bon Jovi, but I think that &quot;Never Say Goodbye&quot; is ten times better.<br />In closing, buy this album if you really like the new Bon Jovi, or a weird concoction of the old and new.  It contains the last remaining pieces of a rock band that &quot;popped&quot; on the hard rockers that liked it and the softer touch that many felt betrayed by in later albums.  If you love the old Bon Jovi, however, just snag one of the old singles of &quot;Bad Medicine.&quot;<br />Thanks for reading and &quot;rock on.&quot;en times better.   <br />In closing, buy this album if you really like the new Bon Jovi, or a weird concoction of the old and new.

0375414053|5.0|I read it in 2 days while on a business trip away from my toddler and disabled husband.  Literally could not put it down.  Eye-opening look at the pressures on working women.  Her internal dialogue is my internal dialogue.   Her guilt is mine as well.  Glad for how it ended.
B00005OAIE|4.0|This is one of those albums that I don't have to go too far in depth with.  It just feels good.  Sometimes people tend to analyze too much instead of just feeling the music.  This is one of those albums that I ride to with the top down and I just unwind.  It's also helpful for me when I need a break from hip hop.  This is a nice progression from his previous album (Inside Wants Out).  He lets us into his life with some great sonic backdrops.  I just wish this album was longer.  Pick it up.  It'll make a great addition to your library.<br />Personal Favorites: Why Georgia, No Such Thing, 3 X 5, Neon (my favorite), Your Body Is A Wonderland, 83, & City Love,
B00005JLRT|2.0|You know the saying: &quot;Even-numbered Star Trek films are good, odd-numbered ones are bad.&quot; This statement held true for some 25 years (although I am rather partial to &quot;The Search for Spock&quot;) until &quot;Nemesis&quot; hit the screen. This movie had lots of hype about the Romulans being in it, but it turned out to be full of plot holes and missed oppertunities. I ranted so much about what was wrong with &quot;Nemesis&quot; after I saw it that I ended up losing my voice.<br />Firstly, don't get me wrong - I love Star Trek, so much that even little things about &quot;Nemesis&quot; annoyed me. For example, how come Picard is bald in the picture of himself as a cadet? We've seen young Picard before - with hair. Also, what the hell happened to Wesley quitting the academy to go off with &quot;The Traveller&quot;? Why does he show up at the wedding? And why isn't there any mention of Lore when B-4 is found - they don't even speculate as to how another android like Data ended up on some random planet! I also hated how the entire Romulan fleet could only muster up TWO lousy ships to help the Enterprise near the end. However the worst problem with the movie is the use of the transporter &quot;beacon&quot; - THE TRANSPORTER WAS DOWN! That's why a creative way of boarding the Romulan ship was required in the first place!! Surely that stupid little badge isn't a self-contained transporter...I hated the entire ending to this movie. I thought it was awkwardly written and directed - but I'll give &quot;Nemesis&quot; this: it's better than &quot;Insurrection&quot;. The coolest thing about this movie ***SPOILER*** is the bit where the bridge gets blown apart, since I always wondered how it never got smoked before, being right near the hull and exposed to attack.<br />This movie was a huge dissappointment. Rent &quot;Wrath of Khan&quot; (especially to see a villain who isn't lame like Shinzon) or watch some TNG reruns instead of seeing &quot;Nemesis&quot;. This movieserves mainly to remind the world that Rick Berman is finally starting to succeed in his apparant quest to destroy the Star Trek franchise via his ineptitude...
B0001HAISG|5.0|I saw this film in the theater and was unmoved by it.  I couldn't hear much of the quick, accented dialogue and didn't appreciate its faithfulness to Barrie's classic story.  <br />I just saw it for the second time on DVD and was blown away.  This is a VERY, VERY well-made motion picture.  In my second viewing, I saw levels of meaning in the story and nuances to the performances that I hadn't realized were there. PJ Hogan's direction is masterful.  He captures the magic of Neverland and the sadness of Peter's final decision in a way that has not been done before.<br />The visual effects and cinematography (especially the use of color) are mesmerizing.  The acting by both the kids and adults is terrific.  Jeremy Sumpter has the pivotal role - the weight of the film rests on his shoulders.  That is a lot of pressure on a 12-year-old but Sumpter handles it admirably.  The British kids (Wendy, John, Michael(stand-out performance), and the Lost Boys) are so good in their roles that it seems almost effortless.  Jason Isaacs proves yet again why he is a coveted actor. <br />PJ Hogan's &quot;Peter Pan&quot; is a classic in the making.  Young or old, this film is guaranteed to leave you with a great, big smile.<br />One piece of advice: watch this one time with SUBTITLES on.  A lot of the funniest lines are really quick, heavily accented or are in the background.  Seeing it all will double your enjoyment.<br />BUY, IF YOU ENJOYED:<BR>Lord of the Rings<BR>The Sandlot<BR>Goonies<BR>any skillfully-made film.
B0001Z52RU|1.0|everything about this movie is unwatchable. while i think that cinema needs a few more good perverts, in the tradition of david lynch, david cronenberg and alfred hitchcock, the butterfly effect goes about it in a grossly obvious, conventional way, which kills the profound quality the movie wants to have. it has a plot which sounds a bit like blue velvet, what with the evil beneath the surface of the suburbs and whatnot, but blue velvet succeeds because its ugliness becomes beautiful and the evil becomes funny. every shot in the butterfly effect looks like the cover of an album you don't ever want to play, and it is done with a horribly straight face. it can't even be described as entertaining trash, because the feverish 'omigod we're the wachowski brothers we're such amazing college students' feel turns any dicerning moviegoer off immediately.
B00000JCOV|5.0|Forget the album cover. I almsost didn't buy this album 5 years ago because they did look like a cheap knock-off of Insane Clown Posse, who suck, IMHO. I bought the album because I had heard &quot;Spit it Out&quot; through a live stream on the RoadRunner Records site and almost crapped myself at how tight this band was. I'm so glad that I did buy this album and proudly call myself a &quot;maggot&quot; because this album is pure perfection. Anyone who needs further proof of how hard this band rocks should go see them live and jump into the pit. Slipknot slipped out of the cornfields of Iowa and just kicked your rear end!!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|this movie has got to be one of the best movies ever but even the best movie can fall short if it is not released as it should.<BR>Casing 5: the casing is really red and it folds out telling you its a celebration of freedom, beauty, truth and love so you know what the movie is about.<BR>Special features (disc 1) 5: it is nice to see the making of the film moulin rouge as you watch it(not for 1st time viewers). the green fairy will show you what an effort it was to make MR. i feel sad that they didnt have the laguage option in french. but spanish works too.<BR>(disc 2) 5: i love being in charge of the multi angle dance scenes. the easter eggs let you peek in some more into the making of the film. there is an interview with baz that shows you what MR was going to be(trust me it wouldve been a twisted musical).<BR>Film itself 5: you cant do an better than moulin rouge, not even chicago. this movie makes you wanna jump up and sing (which i admit to). it is simply a spectacular ride from begining to end. <br />pros: the color makes you feel alive and you get sucked into the movie. the dancing is just fabulous.<BR>cons: people might not like the updated songs in a movie taking place in parisian 1899. also if you are watching it in spanish audio when they start singing its in english and this becomes annoying but other than that it is a quintessential musical to have besides the rocky horror.
6304711891|4.0|Beautifully cast with Nicholas Cage as the reluctant biochemist and Sean Connery as the only man ever to have escaped from Alcatraz teaming up to defeat Ed Harris, playing a psychotic who is holding San Francisco virtual hostage. Before long, all the players are in place and viewers are treated to an action-packed couple of hours of bullets, bodies, explosions, close calls, harebrained 2nd guessing, near misses, near hits - and I don't care how many of these over-the-top movied you've seen: this one keeps you on the edge of your seat.<BR>Sean Connery, of course, plays himself - and that slight Scottish lisp and raised eyebrow are both firmly in place; he's simply terrific. So is Cage, whom I don't usually enjoy watching - he's just too pathetic and conflicted looking. But he's perfectly case in The Rock. It's obvious that the actors had a ball during the filming. Viewers will too. Don't miss it.
0783225881|5.0|More than any other film, Field of Dreams, as presented by Phil Alden Robinson, best exemplifies the wonderfully spiritual 19th century philosophy of Emerson and Thoreau: Transcendentalism. Transcendentalism venerates nature; so do Ray Kinsella and Shoeless Joe on Kinsella's Iowa farm. Transcendentalism holds that paying close attention to intuition is an essential key to life; Field of Dreams is rife with characters following through on their intuitive insights. Transcendentalism holds that God speaks to us from within; Field of Dreams uses &quot;The Voice&quot; to show that Kinsella was finally listening. Transcendentalism demonstrates that everything in the universe is interconnected; Field of Dreams uses baseball and Kinsella's mystical field to show this hidden relationship among seemingly disparate things. I can think of no other movie that better demonstrates the healing power of our one true American spiritual philosophy. And I still can't believe it did not make the American Film Institute's list of the best 100 movies of all time. It is a magical experience.
B000148KK2|5.0|I love all of Diana Kralls music but rather than covering old jazz standards Krall has gone in a new diretion with the help of Elvis Costello's brooding and soulful music. The songs are perfectly suited to Diana Krall's voice. To my ear the cd builds in intensity and emotion as you get further into the songs. I can understand some people might not like this new direction but after listening to the cd her sound continues to grow and get under your skin. Give it a try and you might love it. It took a lot of  guts to do a cd like this and I feel her new direction should continue.
B0001HAISG|5.0|I PURCHASED THIS YESTERDAY WITH THE LAST SAMURAI, AND BOY WAS I EVER ASTOUNDED! I'VE SEEN THEM ALL ON TV, DVD, AND ON STAGE, BUT THIS TAKE AS DIRECTED MY JP HOGAN, MAY VERY WELL RANK WITH THE VERY BEST, IF NOT THE BEST!  PETER, WENDY, CAPT. HOOK, ARE ALL ACTED WITH SUCH PANACHE AND NATURALISM, YOU REALLY BELIEVE PETER IS REALLY STILL COMING TO OUR CHILDRENS WINDOWS. IT IS SPECTACULAR TO WATCH, BEAUTIFUL TO BEHOLD, AND WONDERFUL TO STILL FEEL THAT MAGIC THAT JM BARRIE WROTE SO MANY YEARS AGO.  A REAL MASTERPIECE ON DVD IT OUTSHINES MOST OTHER RELEASES SO FAR, THIS YEAR.  GET IT BEFORE THE SHELVES ARE PICKED CLEAN, YOU WILL NOT IN ANY WAY BE LET DOWN!
B000000H3W|5.0|this was when sepultura really started kicking ass. songs like subtraction, desperate cry, regnum irae, and the title track are reason enough to buy this album. however, the whole album kicks ass from begining to end. sepultura at their best, buy it.
B0000640VO|5.0|This movie deserves every compliment it gets, as in &quot;imitation is the sincerest compliment.&quot;<br />The &quot;Triplets of Belleville,&quot; for example, used much that was already in this movie. Lots of ToB faces appeared here first, as well as the high-dormered house by the railroad. ALso, the &quot;stolen gnome&quot; urban legends sound a bit recycled after seeing this movie.<br />&quot;Amelie&quot; just wonderful (and insanely funny), but the other reviews already said that. The only thing I have to add is that the 'orange day' baffled me up until near the end, when a scene appeared that really was orange.
B000000H4V|3.0|this is where they started the weird tribal crap. stick with &quot;beneath the remains&quot; and &quot;arise.&quot;
B0000C7GG2|4.0|This album is a must for Alternative music fans.  But its not the best from this dynamic band.  Overall the album has a carefully packaged feel.  If you listen to the lyrics of each track they essentially carry the same theme.  Although, I like the uniformity of this album, what drew me to this operatic-type rock band (not a clone of Radiohead) was the difference in songs like &quot;Citizen Erased&quot; and &quot;Darkshines&quot;.  Both songs are equally energetic but leave the listener with a different vibe.  <BR>    <BR>   This album also seems to be the most depressive one that they've made so far.  The music attempts to project a lighter tone but the lyrics uncover the vail.<BR>   The comparision to Radiohead is silly.  Radiohead a great band, relies more on synth-beats and great irrie riffs.  And Muse relies more on classical piano and guitar riffs.  Listen to R's &quot;creep&quot; and M's &quot;Screenager&quot; back to back, There's a difference.  <BR>   &quot;Sing For Absolution&quot; and &quot;Absolution&quot; are two of the best songs on this album.  Though its a simple effort from Muse its a great one.  One that you could just pop in the player on a long road trip and listen to from beginning to end.

B0000AXE8I|1.0|This is a boring piece of eye candy.  The plot is tiresome and makes no sense at all.  I had to watch it since it is considered such a classic series (I don't think so but that's just me).  I didn't like first film very much but I liked the idea very much.  K. Reeves is one of the worst actors (and I use the word loosely) on earth (worse than Tom Cruise or William Shatner).  This guy's only decent role was as a moron stoner in Bill and Ted...  This series needs a film called, The Matrix:Unloaded and Erased from history.  I like L. Fishburne and I liked the sets and costumes but no plot, tiresome, hackneyed action scenes, and plot holes you could drive a large blazing semi truck through.  Skip it or watch it on HBO, don't throw your geld away.
B00001U0E1|1.0|This is truly amazing {NOT}, I mean I did not realize that Shakespeare was that skinny, does anybody else notice that? Paltrow disguising herself as a man to act in one of his plays, well of course in his time women were not allowed to act on stage but then you have the same useless shallow, superficial plot where the man only loves the woman because of her &quot;beauty&quot;, these kinds of films are dull, pointless crap and those oscar people don't give awards to good films only to crappy ones, why oh why is that to be?
B000005DQR|5.0|DJ Shadow surprised me twice. First time, when I first heard &quot;Endtroducing&quot;, which I borrowed from a friend. Never before had I heard such thoughtful and brilliantly blended instrumental hip-hop-based music. Second time was when I found out, that this entire record is made of samples. Only samples. 100% samples, and nothing else. Knowing this, I found a whole new perspective to this music. Besides being a good composer and songwriter, DJ Shadow is also technically proficient like no one else. His mastery of sampling is astonishing. It's obvious, how much time and effort was put into creating &quot;Endtroducing&quot;, and how perfect it became in te end. DJ Shadow displays technological perfectionism in everything.<br />On to the music. The music is basically hip-hop with a huge influence of jazz, with a touch of drum-n-bass and trip-hop. With an exception of &quot;The Number Song&quot; and &quot;Mutual Slump&quot;, the tracks are mostly mellow ambient pieces, and the entire album is very pleasing to the ears, and to the mind either. The abundance and variety of sampled cuts prove that Shadow has a deep background of music studying, since I've never seen anyone guessing the source of most of samples on this album.<br />Once again I'll insist that this record is an example of music that most of us have never heard before, and at least one album of DJ Shadow is a necessary listen. This one might be the best of them.
B00005JKC3|2.0|OH My lord, where do I start. The stroy line just seemed stupid as hell and the action was very good. that's the only reason I even gave it a two out of five. It just was a slow ass movie, I'm sorry but it just was. Maybe when they make the second Hulk Movie their have people with sense to make it.
6303305520|1.0|Gah, I couldn't believe I paid money for this garbage.  I heard a lot of hype about how awesome it was, so I figured it would be worth my while.  I was extremely disappointed with this movie.  I couldn't make any sense of the story (or lack thereof).  Characters show up and you have no idea who they are, where they came from, or why they're in the movie.  All I could figure out was that at some point Tokyo was nuked and Neo Tokyo was rebuilt in the resulting crater, and it's a really screwed up world to live in. Do yourself a favor and find a real anime to watch.
B00005JKCH|5.0|whoa now that's a movie, It was a very action pack leave you guessing what will happen next,type of movie. It is a very good movie and if you like Spider Man and have not seen this yet. Then go slap your self across the face as hard as you can. This movie makes the Hulk look like a pile of you-know-what. Oh yeah you remember that part of the movie when Peter Parker was looking at his muscles in the mirror, those were mine. They just turned it into a white mans body. but it's kool but anyway it was a very good movie
B00005JME0|5.0|Attending the movie i had a low estimation of what i should expect... all the critics hated it! Complaining bitterly about the content, directing and cast of the film. Upon leaving the film i was shocked about how wrong they actually were! The cast was incredible... through out the time traveling i saw not one error to put doubt into my mind! The change over from childhood to adult was floorless and very well put together and the film itself was intense and exciting! Kutcher was a great actor and deffinatly suited the part as did most of the crew. There may have been a few dodgy parts... child pornography etc but it was delt with and gave a great effect! I have given this film 5 stars, as i cant remember seeing any other film recently that i enjoyed as much! I will be queueing up on the 6th of July to purchase this!
B0000CFW87|5.0|This man is INCREDIBLE!  The voice is like a smooth wine and the lyrics speak to you i a personal way.  There is something in here for everyone.  Some happiness and some pain in the one that got away.  Can't wait to get his other cd's in the mail.
0743455967|5.0|What a surprise this book turned out to be!  This should be a must-read for all writers.  It speaks to the writer's soul, and stays with you long after the reading ends.  Memories of King's childhood were fascinating, hilarious, and heart-breaking.  His insights on the creative process, invaluable.  Whether or not you write professionally, or if you don't write at all, reading this book will be an enriching experience.  Best of all, it's a real page-turner!
1592400876|5.0|If you care about proper writing and are responsible for creating it--whether in legal briefs, novels, newspaper columns, or daily memos to the boss--you ought to take time to read this.  In ten-minute doses, a few days will get you through it with ease and a contented smile.  And starting a sentence with and is one thing she and I disagree about.  But (and that's another) that doesn't detract from either the accuracy of her points or the sting of her barbs.<br />I received it as a gift, but would have gladly paid three times the asking price to obtain a copy.
B00005KARK|5.0|There is so much debate to what is the best ever cartoon animated movie and you'll get answers such as &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;, &quot;Aladdin&quot;, and &quot;The Lion King&quot;. But this movie is above and beyond better than them and all the other cartoon animted movies. I wouldn't call it the best G Rated ever because of the likes of live-action G Rated movies such as Babe and Gordy and computer animated G Rated movies such as Toy Story but before all those, there was Dumbo. All those movies have heart-warmth and Dumbo is a big reason why because it's a pioneer for those movies. It's the first G Rated ever made that warmed people's hearts because of a young circus elephant that wanted to find his mom because she was taken away from him. The best part in the movie is when he goes to visit his mom and she's rocking him in her trunk. That part really touched my heart. The other character I like is the mouse. He's very funny and the fact he befriends this very sad elephant is classic friendship. Sure this movie might be out-dated now but to us fans, it will forever be a classic!
B0000DJZA0|3.0|I am very picky about the concert CDs I buy, and this was no exception. I was a bit disappointed after having downloaded a handful of prior Coldplay concerts (as well as attending one). The songs add a little variety to the recorded versions, but not really enough to justify buying this set. Other groups (Dave Matthews comes to mind) have set the bar very high on producing variations on the originals, and Coldplay tends to stick to the studio formulas pretty closely. If you can ever find a recording of their 2002 concert at The Forum in London, it is a fine example of what this album should have been. The band is capable of a lot more, I'm just not sure why the label decided to use these particular tracks.
B00005JMEW|2.0|If you like the idea of a chick killing a lot of people using samurai swords, this might be just another average movie for you.  Otherwise it's not worth your time.  The movie lacks storyline and development.  Acting is bad.  And what's up with the insertion of anime in this?   It was 10 minutes long too..what the heck are they thinking about?
0440241413|5.0|I really enjoyed this novel and couldn't wait to pick up &quot;Shopaholic Takes Manhattan,&quot; and &quot;Shopaholic Ties the Knot.&quot;  I made a midnight trip to Wal-Mart (which is about 20 minutes from my house)to pick up the next two because I wanted to continue on with the series.  I was really bummed when Wal-Mart didn't have them; I couldn't wait another day to start up on &quot;Manhattan.&quot;  This is definitley an exciting book.  Becky Bloomwood won't be forgotten!
B0000AQVCL|1.0|To say that Jet derive their\\"aham\\" style from  former rock acts is to give them to much credit. They are merely mouth peices of<BR>former good acts that have gone before them. You whould have to be under 15 (and don't know) or over 40 (and reliving your youth) not to understand that. One can only imagine the star studed law suit that could ensue an album like this, I mean if the Verve was sued (by the Rolling Stones) for their Bitter Sweet Symphony Jet should be in court any day now. When I first heard Iggy's famous \\"Lust for Life\\" in car comercials I thought<BR>\\"my god things must be bad for old Iggy\\" but it was much worse,<BR>it wasn't even him, and they have the audacity to sing \\"You look <BR>so fine I REALLY WANT TO MAKE YOU MINE'. U R SO RONG Jet groupies tell us in a jumble of letters, but this CD may prove <BR>signifigant for no other fact than a stepping stone for some <BR>people to get them back into music of this creed or introduce them to better artists in<BR>this creed.<br />Finally this band is just as corporite and controled  as any of <BR>the so called 'boy bands' that are out there not that I'm personly into those type of bands.

0451191153|3.0|If you look further, you will find good reviews that outline the plot of The Fountainhead, so I will not offer my own summary. I will not comment about its merits as a novel either, other than saying that I read the whole damn thing in a day and a half, so it is obvious that I liked it.<br />What I really want to talk about is its philosophical and ethical content, which in my opinion should be taken with a grain of salt.<br />For starters, according to Ayn Rand compassion is nothing but a hypocritical lie, invented by totalitarian governments to control and degrade humans. While I can understand the emotional response of a woman that fled communist Russia, and later observed the excesses committed in her former country, that view is absolutely wrong.<br />Setting aside the fact that I feel very bad for the people that do not believe in compassion and altruism (what could possibly have led them to that conclusion?), you don't even have to \\"defend\\" cooperation and compassion on ethical grounds.<br />There is an enormous amount of biological evidence that shows that humans' behaviour (and of other social species) is determined by complex emotions, that combine both competitive and altruistic urges, to maximize reproduction potential.<br />On another hand, and this will get me in trouble with other reviewers, Ayn Rand cheats while pleading her case. How is that? Well, basically she attributes a bunch of desirable characteristics on the good guys, and all kind of defects on the bad guys.  That way, her philosophical beliefs are reinforced by the emotional response generated by prototypical characters (Roarke = intelligent, good looking, brave, independent = good; Toohey = intelligent, but devious and cruel, and bad looking = bad). If her story was told in a less biased way, her philosophical views would probably feel less &quot;evident&quot;.<br />Such manipulation is not unlike the one displayed in bad action films, in which the bad guy kills in some horrible manner the family of the good guy during the first few minutes of the movie. That way, the writer can feel safe of not disappointing us in the end even though all we'll see is a totally simplistic and predictable final showdown, in which the good guy avenges his family.<br />On another subject, please, never say things like: \\"this is the best book ever written, and people who can't see that are imbeciles\\". That only shows that you have totalitarian tendencies and that most likely you haven't read too many books.<br />I wonder if Ayn Rand ever stopped to think how dogmatic and totalitarian her own views sounded?<br />In the end, in my opinion this book deserves 3 stars (the average of four stars for the story and two for its philosophy).y of the good guy during the first few minutes of the movie.

B000000JO3|5.0|i think its kind of sad that good charlotte can say &quot;I'm just a minor threat so pay no mind&quot; in a song and millions of teeney bopper kids won't understand the reference. music should die.
B00005JLZN|5.0|just saw the movie, it was great the ending was suprising. but i have to admit that i knew what was going to happen from the moment the govenor ask david how many innocent people were put to death while he was in office and when her sickness became known. when you believe in something so strong and someone so easily says something that just shoot a hole in it, in return your determined to still proove your right and they're wrong. you saw how david made point after point and then the govenor ask that one question and he couldnt answer. then you find out she's dying and she knows she's dying. from that point on it should be soooooooo obvious whats going to happen next.
B0000VAFO0|1.0|This production really had a lot going for it.  Capable actors, nice-looking production design &amp; costumes, and an interesting concept.  Then they made the grave mistake of making the movie that they made.  The end result is an uneven, oh-so-serious poseur of an action/horror film that brings in every already-worn-to-death cliche in the book, and then waters it down in order to make it less interesting.  Being the most forgiving kind of horror movie fan, I can enjoy a flawed genre picture if it gives the impression of love for its subject or respect for its audience.  UNDERWORLD gave me the impression of a movie made on a cash register, throwing every market-tested rerun at me for two hours in its safe ploy to rake in piles of cash.  Movies like this display nothing but contempt for their audience (or at best, apathy) and perpetuate the common Hollywood conceit that movie-going audiences aren't intelligent, and are money-spewing fodder for loud, explosive, flashy light shows.  Fine, if you and yours are comfortable with being fed non-creative swill by condescending schmucks in suits that think you're brainless cattle, then continue to support tripe movies like this, and then go watch the E! channel celebrity news and tell all your friends how poignant and insightful and discussion-worthy it all is.<br />Supporting giant-budget mediocrities like UNDERWORLD--and touting them as anything resembling refreshing or creative--is a sure way to guarantee the future of films will bring us instant preview-test-audience classics like TOP GUN 2, PRETTY WOMAN 5, and MORE FASTER AND MOST FURIOUSEST.<br />I'm not saying that every movie has to be perfect to be enjoyed, but have a little respect for your audience, filmmakers.  And audiences, try having a little respect for yourself and not gobble up every loud light show the studios tell you you should like.  If that's all you require, just go buy a bunch of bottle rockets and spend some time outdoors...it's less expensive to you, and your money won't line the pockets of those who see you as mindless cattle with wallets.<br />Go give your money to the filmmakers who're at least ATTEMPTING originality...they're the ones who deserve it and probably have some respect for you as an audience member.

068484267X|5.0|Angela's Ashes by Frank McCourt, tells the harrowing tale of his poverty stricken childhood in the lanes of Limerick, Ireland. McCourt proclaims the beginning of the book, \\"Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood.\\" Angela's Ashes shows the truth of his statement through the horrors and hardships of Frankie McCourt's miserable Irish Catholic childhood. These feelings are shown through many small memories and some more important experiences of Frank McCourt's childhood and teenage years. Despite the sadness and depression displayed in the memoir, McCourt is able to laugh at his poverty and is constantly using irony and his dark humor about his upbringing in Ireland. <BR> Frank McCourt is born Irish Catholic in New York City, but when his only sister dies soon after her birth Frank's family decides to move back to Limerick, his mother's hometown in Ireland, thinking times would be better there. They could not have been more wrong, the depression is at its worst, and the rest of Ireland is trying to leave while they are returning. Malachy, Frank's father, is a severe alcoholic, and cannot provide the family with any money except what the dole, a payment given to the unemployed, gives him. Even then the family of six has to live off practically no money. The children's diet consists of solely fried bread and tea, hardly enough for growing boys to live off of. Their tiny apartment is constantly flooding and the McCourt's are forced into one room with one bed for most of the year. After a year of extremely meager living conditions the two twin baby boys of the family die of malnourishment. Frank's dad, eventually leaves to work in England in a munitions factory, but only after leaving his wife with two more baby boys to feed. As expected Malachy never sends back any money to his family who continue their poverty-stricken lives.<BR> Frank's home and school life is extremely structured around his Catholic religion. During Angela's Ashes Frankie McCourt goes through many rites of passage in the religious world, as well as in the Limerick community, which mark his growth into a man. His first confession, first communion, and confirmation were all ceremonies in which Frank and the town of Limerick looked upon as great events which marked moments in a boy's growth into a man and a member of the Catholic Church. But also in this memoir McCourt mentioned occasions which meant the most to him while growing up. The time of the most pride for Frank is when he starts earning some money when he is a young teenager and is able to help feed his family. That however was short-lived and he soon has to return to school. When Frank finishes school as a young adult he begins a real job at the Limerick Post Office as a message boy. Also as a tradition in Ireland he had his first pint of beer the night before he turned 16, an acceptance into the man's world in Limerick.<BR> I believe that Angela's Ashes is a great inspirational memoir as well as a very entertaining story. McCourt not only writes in the perspective of a child or teenager, he makes it convincing that the writing is coming from an adolescent, not a forty-year old English teacher as he is. However that does not stop him from using wonderfully descriptive language and intelligent writing which is consistent throughout the book. The incredible story of his childhood kept me captivated, and funny anecdotes made me laugh out loud, and stopped me from being too depressed by Frank's sad tale.
B000089CKH|4.0|This album is like a great milkshake. Its smooth. great vocals and gorgeous hooks come in every track. Its cool. the perfect blend of crooning and rhythmic guitar(acoustic and electric). Its good all the way through. You wont be disappointed by a single track.

1592400876|5.0|I am dismayed by the reviewers who dismissed this book.  It is an educational, entertaining and interesting book.  Very worthwhile for those of us who could use help with our English and even for those whose English is perfect.  I've recommended this book to several people and think it would be a great gift to anyone who speaks and writes English.  Buy this book. You won't regret it.   It's one of those books that you want to keep for youself and not pass on to friends.
031286504X|5.0|This book has nothing to do with vampires.  To me, it's a tale spun around a man who has nothing to interact with other than a bottle of boze and Ottorino Repshigi recordings.  This man knew 'lonesome'.  And the ending was one of the most FABULOUS i've come across.  Forgot King, or whomever else.  Carrere, Kressing, and this man are horror.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I hope the last review was a joke.<br />This album is a beautiful departure.  Unlike the subsequent albums, this doesn't feel like &quot;music to kill yourself to&quot;.  <br />This was the last radiohead album I bought; and after listening to Kid A, Amnesiac and Hail To the thief... I can see why.  Those albums do have a few good songs on them, but not enough to warrant my praises (unless I'm one of those people obsessed with pro-tools and minimal instrumentation.)<br />Listen to the rest of Radiohead's albums first, but definitely buy 'Ok Computer', 'The Bends', and 'Pablo Honey' with blind faith.
0440178002|5.0|The best book I've ever experienced!!!  note:There are some historic inconsitincies such as the name of Toranaga is actually named Tokugawa.  The clash of western civilization and eastern civilization in the beginning of the 17th century is told very well in this story.  It is a very long read but, by the time you finish you want more!!  It is an epic, action, suspense, romance novel, filled with all the elements of a great read.           ---the greatest novel I've read so far!!!!!!
B0000AXE8I|5.0|This was a good Movie Kind Of Long though you may asleep on it. Jada Pinkett &amp; Nona Gaye Did their thing.
B000002MY3|5.0|This album of Alanis Morissette is great! She writes her own lyrics, what every good artist should do. Her lyrics are about life. You'll have to take it like a JAGGED little pill, they are really good. All over the world she sold 30 million jagged little pills, so it's worth a shot if you aren't a fan of her.
0141439734|5.0|I believe that this book deals alot more with chemical (alcohol)addiction and the seemingly alternate personalities one can create as a result of pounding the brews, shouting the needle, etc.    <BR>I've read that Stevenson entered a kind of trance and wrote the original while locked in a room for four days.  His wife read the manuscript and made him burn it because of it's wickedness.  He then wrote the entire story again.  I would've loved to have seen the orig. because as far as horror is concerned, I've never read 'Jekyll's' equal.
B000002TQV|5.0|Brilliant lyrics. Brilliant songs.   It was &quot;overrated&quot; if you didn't understand how important it was for British rock to crack the American mainstream. These songs are 90's guitar rock classics.  They were the perfect songs to learn how to play guitar to &amp; to understand what songwriters could do with only the four basic instruments.  <br />I also recommend 'Pablo Honey' for it is in the same vein of &quot;pretty melodies mixed with thrashing guitars.&quot;  <br />A classic.
B00003CWL5|4.0|American Beauty objectified women by a panoptical regime by the way Ricky's camera.  Panopticism is when a person doesn't know if they are being watched, but always have the feeling like they are being watched. Through Ricky's camera, Ricky is the surveyor, while everyone else is the surveyed, which is how beauty is defined.  The movie both reproduces stereotypes and critiques them as well.  It reproduces stereotypes because Angela is the attractive blond cheerleader, who thinks she's the best, but in reality is fake.  It critiques stereotypes because Carolyn isn't your stereotypical housewife, who cooks and cleans.  Carolyn also breaks the stereotype of men cheating on women, when she has a fling with her competition.  Overall its a weird but interesting film.
B00005JMEW|3.0|This Movie should not be showed to kids under 17 because movie is full of a lot of revenge. Do not be disappointed about Vivica Fox Or Lucy Liu.it's a long movie uma Is great for the character she portays,  Alot of Kirate fighting & Sword Fighting  makew this movie A THRILLER.
B0001Z53CY|5.0|This is a great follow up to 'Devils Night', it is more serious and has deeper and darker lyrics. It still has alot of the older sounding funny D12, jus has a few more serious songs. The DvD has alot of great stuff too, it has the video for 'My Band' and a new video for the song '40 oz.' and it has interviews and such where they talk about the album and it shows they production process. I just think they could have found a bit more of an original CD title lol.

Tim Burton's worst movie &quot;BIG fISH&quot; released AND Tim's Masterpiece &quot;Ed Wood&quot; rejected by the distributors.<BR>How possible?<BR>I cannot understand why Burton decided to stop making good films, and started making CRAP!!<BR>If anyone agrees with me, please vote at amazon, for the Ed Wood's realease.And the ban of Big Fish!<br />See you.

There were ambulances waiting out in front of some theatres, due to the shortness of breath, heart palpitations, etc. of certain audience members. I knew this was no ordinary horror movie! Thirty years later, this version is released on DVD with restored footage that makes it all the more terrifying! Ellen Burstyn is perfect as the moviestar mom, exhausting all options to get help for her possessed daughter, Regan (Linda Blair), who grows increasingly dangerous to herself and others. Blair captures both the sweet innocence and vile demonic presence inhabiting her body. She is an astonishing figure once the pea-soup hits the fan! We forget the little girl and focus on what she has become. Jason Miller is great as the priest who thinks he's lost his faith. He has no idea that his faith is about to be brutally challenged and subsequently enlarged. Max Von Sydow IS Father Merrin. He performs the rites of exorcism in a normal / natural way that makes it seem like a totally real event. Lee J. Cobb is the cop on the trail of whoever / whatever broke the neck of Regan's babysitter, and tossed him out the window to his death. Back to Regan herself, she is one scary little kid! Whether cussing her head off, twisting her head around backward, puking that icky green stuff, rising off the bed with those white eyes of hers, or walking down those stairs like a crab / spider, Regan is flawlessly, flesh-crawlingly mesmerizing! I read the book and found the movie to be every bit as jolting. One of THE best horror films ever made. Buy immediately...

B0001611DI|5.0|Dawn of the Dead is one of my favorite films and probably my favorite zombie film, I really wish I could classify it as a horror movie, but I don't really consider it inspite of some horror elements it has.<br />I found it very, very entertaining, funny, well-acted and well written and with some great (if not dated) gore effects and I have to say that some complains about the movie have left me startled though.<br />&quot;It wasn't scary!&quot;-It's not meant to be scary, it's an action satire more than anything else.<br />&quot;Bad acting&quot;-Okay, maybe to a degree, but the acting here is far better than what I've seen in films like Gothika.<br />&quot;No explanation&quot;-AHEM! This is a sequel to Night of the Living Dead, but let me say that there is no real explanation to the whole phenomenom, people just keep wondering about why it's happening. The whole ambiguity of it is what makes it so effective and remindful to a degree of Hitchcock's &quot;The Birds&quot;<br />&quot;Drags on too much&quot;-That's more of a matter of personal taste, but I never found this movie to drag, I thought it was a lot of fun from beginning to end and it allowed to shed a bit of light into the characters<br />&quot;How did the zombies get into the mall?&quot;-Do movies must spoon-fed everything to modern audiences these days? The doors were open as simple as that.<br />That's all I have to say about this fantastic film, I'm not sure if I can recommend it to everybody, but all I can say is that I completely love it and it's the best zombie movie I have ever seen and while Night of the Living Dead is excellent as well, I think Dawn surpasses it in some aspects.
0451191153|4.0|Ayn Rand's &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;, like her &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; (which I had previously read), is a fast, interesting, thought-provoking if overly idealized read. Above all else, it's very strongly written, clear in its intentions and consistent in its characterizations. It is, while being most noted as a vessel for a particular philosophy (Rand's &quot;Objectivism&quot;), first and foremost an oustanding literary work. I would strongly recommend it for anybody interested in politics, philosophy or social issues - positive or negative, it's sure to get a response.<br />In this novel, Ayn Rand takes us into the lives of Howard Roark and Peter Keating, two aspiring architects who choose differing paths when forced to market their skills in the world - Keating choosing that of populism and pleasing the masses, while Roark chooses that of individualism and self-sufficiency. Other characters become involved in shaping the story and characters, including Ellsworth Toohey, a socialist newspaper columnist who coddles Keating and gives support to various &quot;mediocre&quot; artists; Dominique Francon, an independent, free mind who influences both of the lead characters; and Gail Wynand, the owner of several newspapers whose content he continues to ignore until it's almost too late. The story largely follows the two leads, Roark and Keating, as they adapt to the market with Rand's unique philosophical discourse espoused strongly in the final 50-100 pages as the resolution nears.<br />As a story, it's one with few faults. It flows quickly and remains true to its ideals. Rand's writing is, while overly idealized (okay, okay, so nobody in the real world goes on these kinds of idealistic rants seemingly at random places in normal dialogue), on a whole very readable and descriptive. The plot culminates well, even if the motivations of the some of her characters and her arbitration of &quot;hero&quot; and &quot;heroic&quot; are sometimes open for questioning. The onlyplot point I would question is the resolution to the legal battle near the end, which while serving Rand's ideological point, has no semblance of realism at all. That verdict would simply not happen. Anywhere. Ever.<br />On an ideological level, this novel has the same strengths and weakness as her other major novel, &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;. On the plus side, it's clear, well articulated, forceful and likely to please anyone with even a fleeting interest in her style of thinking, that individualism promotes greatness and collectivism promotes mediocrity and tyranny. Using the dichotomy of Roark and Keating, two idealized characters, she manages to stress this point well.<br />On the minus side, there is a great deal of this story which is idealized to the point where it loses some of its relevance in the real world. The world is not as even and completely divided as she paints it, with all individualists aspiring to individual greatness and all collectivists aspiring towards either a) complacency; or b) absolute power over complacency. There are a great deal of individualists who aspire towards hedonism and self-gratification and a great deal of collectivists who aspire towards general well-being. There are also people who don't seen individualism and collectivism as mutual exclusive philosophies, depending on the issue addressed. In that sense, the character of Ellsworth Toohey is somewhat of a strawman - he's meant to symbolize everything that associated with collectivism, but represents only Rand's interpretation of it, people who preach general well-being but seek personal power.<br />The philosophy, like all philosophies, also suffers from the leap from one or two, or a handful of, situations to a universal truth. In this case, she jumps individualism promotes greatness while collectivism promotes mediocrity (which is still questionable) to individualism is a superior moral philosophy to collectivism (she made a similar jump in &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; from individualism is superior to collectivism economically, therefore...). If you're willing to make the jump that great architecture is produced by individuals acting in their own interest not collectively, therefore low income housing is an abomination unless its built by people acting in their own self interest, then fine. Personally, I would keep different tiers of a philosophy's application (moral, economical, social, asthetic, etc.) separate. That asthetic greatness can be produced by one man acting for his own selfish good does not, to me, imply that all those who seek to help others are suckers.<br />Anyway, recommended reading.<br />Matthew D. Johnston
B000002HJR|5.0|What can I say?  In my opinion Down is the best band on the planet.  I bought this album years ago because I was a fan of Pantera and knew that Phil fronted Down.  Down does not sound like Pantera but they do rock out hard!  Nola is my favorite CD in my collection.  #10-Stone the Crow is my all time favorite song.  If you don't own this album then something is seriously wrong with you!
B0000C6E4D|5.0|There are no surprises here... as expected, Sarah is ALWAYS good. I love her sound. This cd is full of pleasing music.
B0001BKAEY|3.0|Everyone entered this movie believing they would see the first Matrix revamped, although what we got was not. This a very good and very bad thing. The good part about the change is a very epic conclusion and more character developement. However the bad part of straying from the formula is that is goes often from action to sappy 1950 war movie. <br />The two main things people tend to focus on is the lack of actually being in &quot;The Matrix&quot; and rather channeling onto Zion, and the dissaperence of interesting characters. These are both evident and most Matrix fans and viewers would have agreed they would of welcomed a longer apperence by the Merovingian or a couple non-Neo fight scenes in the Matrix, not Zion. Do not expect a comeback of the twins or another cheateu duke out, simply a chat with a few thousand guns that never fire.<br />So to people expecting a full out action/brawl movie you will be sadly dissapointed. The Wachowskis instead worked on finishing the series with a conclusion rather than a big bang. Personally I would of liked a little more of a brawler movie, because we didn't start watching The Matrix Series to see &quot;an intellectual movie&quot; we wanted to see bullets fly and awesome hand on hand fights. This movie on its own stands proud, but try to not compare it to the preceding Matrix movies or you may end up hating it completely. <br />So should you buy it or rent it? Well, to people who just completely were disgusted with the second movie then I say don't watch it at all. If you won't take my advice at least rent it to see. To people who really need a conclusion to the series and absoulutly dying to see what happens then I suggest renting or buying it. At least check out all the reviews before you heave out 20 bucks, in actuallity it is a one time watch movie.<br />This movie is not a masterpeice or a bomb, it is a well needed conclusion to a wonderful series, nothing more.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|This is the last thing I was expecting. Maiden's best days are behind them, like decades behind them I thought. I had proof of that, I already owned &quot;No Prayer For the Dying&quot; and &quot;Fear of the Dark&quot; and while they both had their moments and neither was objectionable, they don't hold a candle to anything I've heard up through Powerslave. Sure Wickerman off their last album was a great song too, and yes Maiden have held up better than some of the biggest acts to have come since like Metallica so I wouldn't totally disappointed or anything, but they've got nothing new to offer. The radio single from this album, &quot;Wildest Dreams&quot; proves that too..... WRONG! Dance of Death is flat out amazing. The title track tops &quot;Number of the Beast&quot;, &quot;Paschendale&quot; is alone is worth the full price of the album, and everything is well, new. The album's production is slicker, the style is grander and more epic reminding me more of songs like &quot;Revelations&quot; or &quot;Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner&quot; than &quot;Aces High&quot;. There are one or two jaw dropping solos, the composition is just great. This is impossible. Bands that have been putting out albums for 23 years just don't do this. Of course I'm not surprised that Maiden stayed true to their roots here, they always do that. But they have managed to top themselves and no one does that after more than 2 decades and what 15 studio albums? Buy this now, you need this album if you are fan of any kind of heavy metal or hard rock from the past 25 years!
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|There's a dreamlike quality to Big Fish, a kind of luminous, otherworldly tone that befits a story that skips from the incredible to the mundane like a flickering candle. In the end, it is a surreal, touching story--a darn good tear puller--that left me feeling a bit happier, and even a bit wiser.  Nicely done.<br />I must admit that I'd held off seeing this movie because I'd lost hope for Tim Burton.  His downright awful remake of one of my favorite films, Planet of the Apes, had turned me cynical and suspicious.  Was he, as it appeared, just a poseur--with dirty mop of unkempt hair and fat-framed glasses fancied by eighty-year-olds?  Had his successes been a scam perpetrated by a guy who'd fooled a lot of dim-brained Hollywood numbskulls?  Big Fish, if it truly is Burton's child (after the Apes fiasco, I must admit that I've not entirely disabused myself of the idea that Burton just put his name on this--but I digress), redeems him.  It isn't soaringly great, but it is truly well-done and enjoyable.<br />There are a few minor problems which I should point out.  Billy Crudup, who plays a son in search of his real father, is a very weak actor, and whether it's him or the role he plays, or both, he comes across as just plain unlikeable.  It's really too bad, since his role could have provided for an added bit of depth and resonance to the film.  Thankfully, his screen time is very limited--perhaps Burton, himself, judged that Crudup was too weak to merit a central place on the screen.  But for all of Crudup's weakness, Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor give outstanding performances.  McGregor, who plays Crudup's father character as young man, shines with likeability and energy, the kind of person you meet rarely in life and who pulls you in with his joy and indefagitable innocence.  Finney is splended as a sputtering, kind-hearted yarn-spinner.  Jessica Lange is fine in her small role, and the young actress who plays her character as a young woman (Alison Lohman) is almost too beautiful to be believed--which adds, of course, to the ghostly, dreamlike quality of the film.<br />I really liked this film, clumsy fish metaphor aside!  It's gentle and provocative entertainment that is well worth seeing with the whole family.most too beautiful to be believed--which adds, of course, to the ghostly, dreamlike quality of the film.<br />I really liked this film, clumsy fish metaphor aside!

B0001GOH6Q|5.0|This was the best movie I saw in 2003 and really made my all time list. I cried at the theater and I cannot recall the last film that affected me so.  I felt like it lasted a half hour - I didn't want it to end.<BR>Casting was terrific, effects just right, not ove the top as they could have been.<BR>A truly unique story. Symbolic/metaphoric but my 11, 12 y/o kids liked it too.<br />..... oh, I liked it, did I mention that?
B000001FT0|5.0|Talking Back To The Night in 1982 is a bit eclipsed by commercial hit albums Arc of Diver and Back In The High Life but I like this album better than Roll With It and BIHL. It is the rare album that you can enjoy the whole album from start to finish. All of the nine songs shine in its own right. VALERIE and TALKING BACK TO THE NIGHT which came out hits several years later in CHRONICLE album are only a part of the appeal. It is true that some of the songs take a bit of time to sink in such as BIG GIRLS WALK AWAY@but with repeated listen you will be sure to love them. Particularly WHILE THERE'S A CANDLE BURNING is well-hooked gem and last ballad THERE'S A RIVER is plain beautiful. Recommended for Jackson Browne, Eric Clapton, Peter Gabriel, and wide range of 80s adult contemporary music fans.
B00009N83U|1.0|Throughout his long career, actor-director Clint Eastwood managed to avoid the pitfalls of Truly Bad Cinema. However, \\"Pink Cadillac\\" (1989) is a noted exception. This brain-dead romantic comedy, with an offensive white-supremacist subplot, makes \\"Every Which Way But Loose\\" look like a minor masterpiece. Clint registers zero chemistry with co-star Bernadette Peters. Not surprisingly, \\"Pink Cadillac\\" went straight to video in Great Britain (perhaps the only Eastwood film to receive that dubious distinction).
B000062YAZ|5.0|This cd kicks ass. Awesome powerful music better than 99 percent of heavy metal.My favourites are angel of death, postmortem and raining blood. The reviewer who gave this two stars  obviously doesnt know good music (i've read his other reviews).Other slayer cds worth a mention in this review are 1988's SOUTH OF HEAVEN and 1990's SEASONS IN THE ABYSS.<BR>There newer stuffs cool too. Also check out megadeth's albums from the 80's and early 90's and pantera's FAR BEYOND DRIVEN.
B000069AUI|4.0|It is so hard to believe that when it comes to British Rock these days, there is nothing left to whimper about. I say that, because they're really isn't any right now. There was a few years ago, and that was the right time. Many Rock artists right now seem to be more manufactured, not simple and organic. It is just a shame though, especially when nothing compared to the scene of artists who did showcase that like Elton John, The Beatles, Rod Stewart, and The Who. Thankfully, Coldplay recntly came along. When I first heard them, they truly brought a great sense of realism that has combined Elton John, Queen, The Beatles and Radiohead. Chris Martin's voice is just as unique as a kind of apple pie, without losing flavor. That is what Coldplay really is about in the id right now.<br />A Rush Of Blood To The Head is one of the most dynamic records to have ever come out of England, since Made In England by Elton John. The 2002 album was the sophmore record album that proved Coldplay was more than just a novelty band. The songs here are really well worth the voice and tone of the music, unlike manufactured artists like Britney Spears and Jennifer Lopez. There are just so many great songs including, the simple and profound In My Place, the the eclectic Clocks, which was the stand-out winner of the 2004 Grammy for Record Of The Year, The elegantly charged The Scientist, which I absolutely adore its video for, and the brilliantly created piano ballad Amsterdam. There is just so much here that really is still missing from the music industry today, that Coldplay has a lot more to give.<br />This was ranked as Album Of The Year on my Best &amp; Worst of music for 2003, and it still is one of the best records out there. If you haven't heard Coldplay yet, you don't know what you're missing. A Rush Of Blood To The Head has to be in that music collection. No question about it.
B000001E18|5.0|Following closely on the heels of Achtung Baby, Zooropa was released to coincide with the launch of the European leg of the ZooTV tour. Taking the experimental electronica of Achtung Baby to it's limits, Zooropa stands as a unique testament to U2's wide musical range, and IMO is one of their best albums (Certainly in the top six).<br /><br />There is something to this album that evokes a melancholy throughout, layering sonic landscapes with a sense of longing to break free. In this, Zooropa has a very consistent theme and style throughout. Despite being written and recorded during the ZooTV tour and so soon after Achtung Baby, it does have its own unique imprint that sets it apart from the aforementioned classic.<br />The album opens with the title track &quot;Zooropa&quot;. With a momentum building slowly to a sonic crescendo, this track layers so many sounds and styles together, bringing with it an imagery rarely seen in music today. A true classic, and it perfectly sets the theme for the album.<br />&quot;Babyface&quot; is a nicely written and well executed track, not one of their best tracks, but certainly fits the structure of the album, and works well in this context.<br /><br />&quot;Numb&quot; is another departure in style and substance for U2, and probably the best known song off the album. Its mainstream success spawned its share of spoofs, but imitation, flattery and all that:) Besides Edge so rarely gets to take lead vocals, and the track is perfectly suited to his vocal talents.<br />&quot;Lemon&quot;=&quot;MacPhisto&quot;:) The track that gave form to function for Bono's alter ego on the Zooropa tour, Lemon is a track that is layered with longing, a sense of drowning in bittersweet sound.<br /><br />We come to &quot;Stay (Faraway, So Close)&quot;, a track that is simply incredible. The video for &quot;Stay&quot; perfectly fits the song, and is one of the best reflections I can recommend for capturing the spirit of the track. Simply one of the best U2 songs ever recorded!<br />&quot;Daddy's Gonna Pay for Your Crashed Car&quot; is an enjoyable track, nothing more or less.<br /><br />&quot;Some Days Are Better than Others&quot; is a very catchy track lyrically and musically.<br />&quot;The First Time&quot; is a stirring song that keeps the theme of loss, love, melancholy &amp; redemption so prevalent throughout the album. A very simple, but poignant track.<br />&quot;Dirty Day&quot; is another very good track, made great live during the Zooropa tour.<br />The album closes with an enigma in &quot;The Wanderer&quot;, written by Bono and performed by Johnny Cash, this is a track that many people simply did not get. It was so out of step with the rest of the album at first glance, but taking a closer listen it presents a perfect end. With his recent passing, this track has taken on extra meaning, as it is such a departure for both Johnny Cash &amp; U2, and it has made for a very unique and lasting impression.<br />Zooropa is not an album for everyone to be sure, but it honestly takes U2's reinvention that started with Achtung Baby to its extreme, and it was pulled off superbly, providing an album layered in experimental and lasting sounds, with more than its share of classic U2 tracks.ver recorded! <br />&quot;Daddy's Gonna Pay for Your Crashed Car&quot; is an enjoyable track, nothing more or less.<BR> <BR>&quot;Some Days Are Better than Others&quot; is a very catchy track lyrically and musically. <br />&quot;The First Time&quot; is a stirring song that keeps the theme of loss, love, melancholy &amp; redemption so prevalent throughout the album.

0792844882|5.0|If ever you find that the most well intentioned party you've given is quickly taking a nose dive into yawnsville, slap this baby on and let the good times role. I love campy films and this whopper is among my favorites, right after Mommie Dearest, Faster Pussycat...Kill, Kill and Pink Flamingos. Elizabeth Berkley should be used as a textbook example on how to overact while simultaneously not communicating a single emotion. The dialogue you ask? So howlingly bad and unintentionally funny that it borders on the surreal. From what I understand, Joe Eszterhas' brain was on sabbatical during the writing process. Gina Gershon is the saving grace here, folks, even though she is saddled with some of the worst dialogue in the film (if you can imagine) and made to utter \\"Darlin'\\" every ten seconds or so; however, there is no sexier woman in front of the camera and her sex appeal alone carries most of the dead weight and I do mean dead. Some reviews suggest that this film is an exercise in misogyny. Really? I am shocked! A film about a back-stabbing, ambitious drifter turned Vegas showgirl I thought would play out on the screen like a feminist anthem. I am just as shocked as anyone that it comes across as a female-bashing piece of celluloid trash. Let's be honest people, this film is nothing more than \\"All About Eve\\" with g-strings, glitter and glossy production values to cover the glaring absence of any redeeming artistic quality. If you are cinephile and can't stand the idea that you've wasted x number of minutes from your precious life that you will never get back, stay away, big time. However, if you, like me, enjoy, quoting John Waters on \\"The Simpsons\\" the \\"ludicrously tragic\\" and just a plain old cheese fest, you will find much to enjoy. Bad script, worse acting, illogical and improbable scenarios, trite sub-plots, one-dimensional characters, etc. Just plain bad, bad, bad...thank goodness!
B0000C1733|5.0|This is a great CD. The fast-moving songs are awesome, and the slow movers might seem boring at 1st, but after you listen the 2nd or 3rd time you'll learn to love them.<BR>1) Under the Bridge- from 1991's Blood Sugar Sex Magik, its their classic. despite being played constantly, it doesnt get old because of the cool, melodic beat and the awesome, meaningful lyrics. one of the best!- 10<BR>2) Give It Away- from blood sugar sex magik, its got a very funky beat and moves very quickly- 10<BR>3) Californication- from 1999's Californication, its another classic. its lyrics are awesome and the beat just goes along with it so well- 10<BR>4) Scar Tissue- from californication, its got an emo beat and lyrics that you'll just fall in love with- 9<BR>5) Soul to Squeeze- a 1992 single, it has a great deep beat and lyrics- 9<BR>6) Otherside- from californication, its also got a very deep sound and has awesome lyrics. another favorite!- 10<BR>7) Suck My Kiss- from blood sugar sex magik, its got a very funky, fast moving beat and very good sexual lyrics. another favorite!- 10<BR>8) By the Way- from 2002's By the Way, it starts out with a slow, beautiful chorus, then has a very fast moving rap-rock sound- 10<BR>9) Parallel Universe- from californication, its got a very rythimic, almost techno beat, with decent lyrics, and it just sounds like what it represents. another favorite!- 10<BR>10) Breaking the Girl- from blood sugar sex magik, its got a very aucostic sound and decent lyrics- 8<BR>11) My Friends- from 1995's One Hot Minute, its very slow and depressing, but if you listen you will find it great- 9<BR>12) Higher Ground- from 1989's Mother's Milk, it was their 1st hit! this is a combination funk-punk version of stevie wonder's hit and is just great- 9<BR>13) Universally Speaking- from by the way, its got a very slow beat and a decent sound, but (despite that its very good), its my least favorite- 8<BR>14) Road Trippin'- from californication, it's sound is kind of like a high, hippie song (which is a good thing) and the soft lyrics go along with it so well. another favorite!- 10<BR>15) Fortune Faded- a brand new song for this CD, it became an instant his and is always on the radio now. this is becasue its got a great funky beat and catchy lyrics- 10<BR>16) Save the Population- a brand new song, its got good lyrics and a good hard sound- 9
B00008YLV2|5.0|I read an article relating the events in the movie to the events in real life, and that they were extremely accurate.  The movie itself is a great battle, great as in large.  Though many might watch this in confusion, asking such questions like why were we there?  Who are these people we are fighting?  If you want the background do your homework.  You will find that this battle is the result of Communism failing in East Africa, and a country in confusion, plague, and warlords ready to pick up where the Communists left off.  I loved the characters, each individuals, but also a team of brothers with a mission and motto &quot; No man shall be left behind&quot;.  Think about that while watching and imagine if that were you in there place.  The soldiers held back overwhelming odds.  I did not see this as a glorified hail to the American power, but a fight to save hundreds of thousands of starved people.  Difficult to watch at times, graphic, bloody and emotional.  Great movie.
B000148KK2|4.0|After anxiously awaiting the release of this recording, I read some negative comments here at Amazon, and nearly passed this one by.  To my good fortune, I heard the opening track on the radio, and knew I HAD to own this CD!  That one track, the Mose Allison cover &quot;Stop this World,&quot; would be worth every penny spent, even if the rest of the disc reeked.  I then found that several other tracks were of &quot;must have&quot; quality.  &quot;Temptation&quot; smoulders and has a funky bass solo, &quot;Love Me Like a Man&quot; rocks, and originals &quot;The Girl in the Other Room&quot; and &quot;Narrow Daylight&quot; are exquisite, melodic, soothing. <br /> I am also a longtime Krall fan, but became a fan for her piano playing/singing talents combined.  I was blown away by such amazing work on &quot;All for You&quot; and &quot;Love Scenes&quot;, and later &quot;Live in Paris,&quot; But I was bored and disappointed with the strings and syrupy-saccharin quality of &quot;When I Look in your Eyes&quot; and &quot;Look of Love,&quot; which seemed to me to be of a &quot;paint by numbers&quot; quality, overproduced, repetitive, and was also annoyed with all the cheesecake-type photos with the liner notes.  I expect MTV to play up looks over talent, but expect more from a Jazz CD.  Sure she's gorgeous, but these two albums seemed more about that and less about her abilities. <br />Now her piano playing is back, her voice has never sounded better, and this album has depth, heart and soul.  The piano solos between verses really swing,  and the lyrics and melodies are compelling.  I almost gave this recording 5 stars, but of the 12 tracks, there were 2 that were not as good.  But then, how many albums are great, start to finish?  Most have a weaker track or two.<br />This is a great album.  I was shocked that people wanted more standards instead of something new and different.  Don't listen to the nay-sayers!
B00003CX5P|5.0|Now I'm not a nerd, I'm a geek, there's a big difference!!<br />I really enjoy this Star Wars movie. Great special effects, a touch of humour, even Jar Jar is witty if you give him half a chance.<br />Darth Maul was my favourite charecter in this one. I'ts a pity he bit the dust but there are some awesome lightsabre battles to enjoy between him and Qui Gon (Liam Neeson) and Obi-Wan (Ewan Mcgregor). Speaking of Obi-Wan, Mcgregor did a really great job of playing a younger version, he had Alec Guinness down pat. <br />The pod race was also awesome, reminded me of the chariot race in Ben-Hur. Natalie Portman was a little reserved but considering she was playing the queen of Naboo I don't know what else people expected. Loved the younger Yoda in this and was interesting to see Palpatine as a politican in pre-Emperor days behind the scenes operating like a puppet-master. <br />Being a Star Wars fanatic, I awaited this movie like none other since the original trilogy and the day it came out I went twice and was not disappointed, the people who hate this film really need to find peace in their lives and quit being so petty and bitter. And don't hate me for liking this film, I'm really a nice guy!<br />Thanks for reading.
0671027387|3.0|While this book definitely doesn't rise above the genre in the way that Angels and Demons &amp; The Da Vinci Code do, it's a solid page turner.<br />Anyone who has ever read a book before will figure out the final plot twist at least 100 pages before it happens, and, as in Da Vinci Code, you do have to work somewhat hard to suspend disbelief at certain points - particularly in a couple of passages where allegedly brilliant scientists express shock and disbelief upon learning about trivial scientific facts of which any reasonably educated person is aware.<br />The action set-pieces are well-written and often quite ingenious, and, as usual, Brown's background research is quite good, if a bit sensationalized.  If you don't expect another Da Vinci Code, and just want a fun thriller to waste a few hours with and maybe learn an interesting fact or two, you'll like this book.

0553269631|5.0|The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter is a great book! Most people can surely relate to many of the characters in the story. Each person has pretty much the same issues as most of us in every day life.<br />The story shows how it is for people of color in a town of racist white people, what it's like for the deaf to live in a world of silence, of a child's dream to have a passion for music. If you'd like to read a great story, this is your book!
B0001CCXZW|5.0|I couldn't even attempt to list my favorite shows in order of importance. Now that Friends is leaving, I am sad but comforted that at least I still have my &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;. This show has a biting quick wit. Now on DVD, I can watch some of my favorite episodes any time I want, and I find as I watch, not only am I recalling some of my favorite lines and puns, but I'm catching jokes I missed the first time around, and I am still laughing and still being surprised. This show is suitable for families to watch together, and enjoy quality time together as the Gilmore Girls do. This show is fresh, current with loads of pop culture references peppered through to keep you on your toes.  Thank you WB for finally releasing the gilmore girls to be accessable, flowing out among the people with their brilliant humor and tongue twisting gymnastics. <br />thank you<BR>everyone enjoy!!!!!
B0001HAISG|5.0|I really like the Peter Pan movies, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that this is my favorite version they have made of this loveable tale. The fact that they stuck so close to the book was amazing, it is the most accurate that they have made.       The movie special effects were wonderful. The fairies were magical, and made me want to shout out &amp;amp;quot;I do believe in Fairies&amp;amp;quot; while in the movie theater! Flying was always a childhood wish, and to see this movie where they fly off to a world that was perfect in a childs eye was great. Tinkerbell does a great job and even when she is jealous the director allowed her to be more of a girl, and less of a fiction. And Peter, as clueless as ever to what is going on is truly a boy. (No offense to the guys, but seriously, you are clueless when it comes to girls.)      The chemistry between Wendy and Peter is so cute, it made me smile and remember what it was like to be young. The thimble made me laugh and the story made me cry.       The actor that plays Hook does such a wonderful job, he really is very talented. To be such a good actor to play such a bad guy, it is just wonderful to see that! Normally the bad guy is down played, leaving the Hero looking like the strong one and the villian like the wimp. But Hook really does pull his own, and makes his presence known through the capture of Tiger Lilly, John and Michael. He is truly an evil guy, and the actor did a fantastic job!       The whole cast is extrememly talented and fun! I enjoyed every minute of watching them interact and wonder how much FUN they had off screen while making the movie.       It honestly takes you back to your childhood, and I believe this movie will be treasured by both young and old.       Bravo for making this movie, I am just sad that no one seems to have seen it or had any desire to see it. I personally will tell everyone I know how good it is, and that it deserves 10 stars, not just 5.
B000078DOI|5.0|I bought this album shortly after discovering Blood Sugar Sex Magik and falling in love with the album and the band. I set about getting all of their earlier albums, and this is the first one i purchased. <br />Mothers Milk is the first album to feature a completely different line up. Although Kiedis and Flea remain from the original Peppers, their guitarist Hillel Slovak tragically died from a heroin overdose shortly after their previous album, and their drummer Jack Irons went into a depression and left, due to the death of Slovak. So after deciding whether or not to carry on with the band, Kiedis and Flea thankfully kept it going. They enlisted a young guitarist who was a massive fan of the band, John Frusciante. His energy and enthuiasm won him the role, and he could already play all of their songs anyway. On drums, they found Chad Smith, who, although seeming to be out of place with his heavy rock image, fitted in perfectly. They set about writing Mothers Milk together, unaware that this would be the band line-up that would make them world famous.<br />So to the album itself. Their previous album 'Uplift Mofo Party Plan' signalled a slightly rockier edge, and they continued with this direction when making Mothers Milk. The album contains Flea's trademark funky slap bass throughout, and Kiedis's rap style vocals, but it brings in new energy from Frusciante and Smith. My album summary is as follows.<br />'Good time boys' - Starts the album off quite rockily, as it means to go on. Sounds like the CD is jumping in the middle of it, but its not! Some great guitar riffs.<BR>'Higher Ground' - A cover of the Stevie Wonder classic, and better than the original! This one has featured on loads of compilations over the years. Flea's bass is brilliant.<BR>'Subway to venus' - Bizarre vocals about space being king or something. A fairly average song though.<BR>'Magic Johnson' - A tribute song to the legendary US basketball player who the Chili's love. Quite quirky, but funkyas hell when it kicks in.<BR>'Nobody weird like me' - How Flea's fingers don't fall off while playing this track i'll never know, the slap bass is on overdrive. Really fast paced rock song.<BR>'Knock me down' - Mid tempo tune, an extended version of this appears on the re-released, remastered version of the album, but doesn't work quite as well. Good song, not dazzling, but good.<BR>'Taste the pain' - Great little song, good guitar riffs, vocals, and a good video to go with it, buy 'What hits' on DVD if you can!<BR>'Stone cold bush' - One of the album highlights, really rocky song, fast paced, great wah wah guitar, sounds of a woman having an orgasm in the background, what more could you want!<BR>'Fire' - A cover of the Jimi Hendrix song, but about twice the speed. Brilliant version, and dare i say it again, better than the original?!<BR>'Pretty little ditty' - Beautiful little instrumental track, part of which was covered by Crazy town years later on their hit 'Butterfly'. <BR>'Punk rock classic' - Short snappy punk track, very rocky, ending in the guitar riff from GnR's sweet child of mine, bizarrely.<BR>'Sexy mexican maid' - Brilliant smooth song, great groove, sexy lyrics.<BR>'Johnny,kick a hole in the sky' - Great end to the album, got everything, funk,rock, great drumming, weird vocals (i mean what does kick a hole in the sky mean anyway)<br />There is a remastered version of this album available which has extended versions of Sexy Mexican maid and Knock me down, also has 2 brilliant instrumental tracks one of which is probably the funkiest thing they've ever done. It also has 2 live covers of Hendrix songs. Well worth buying.<br />All in all. this album is my 2nd favourite Chili's album after Blood Sugar. It basically paved the way for what was to come, and they re-invented themselves with this album. It is way different to the sound of Chili peppers circa 2004, in my view it is a much better sound, but any Chili's fan old and new will like the majority of this album. Go and buy it, you know you want to!
B00007G1ZC|5.0|To the average movieviewer, Dreams would seem like it was created by a completely insane person.  Who knows, maybe Kurosawa was going crazy during the end of his career.  Even so, he still had something to say from this movie, despite many of the disturbing scenes and confusing moments.  This film is an over-exageration regarding the many problems, and positive aspects, of the human race.  With contrasting settings and open expression, I believe that no other work by Kurosawa has been this personal.  Moreover, it has to be his best film later in his career, right next to Red Beard.  Despite other unsuccessful films, (Ex. Do Des Ka Den) Dreams is Kurosawa's last stand at making such an emotional and valuable film.  My hat is off to this master who is no longer with us.
B000002MTR|4.0|After 1991's classic album Blood Sugar Sex Magik, the Red Hot Chili Peppers were massive. They had become household names and had several hit singles off that album. The euphoria however was short lived, as mid-way through the tour that followed the album, guitarist John Frusciante became disillusioned with fame and left the band.<br />The Chili's somehow had to fill the huge void left by Frusciante, and had a number of different fill-in guitarists to complete the tour. They eventually settled with Dave Navarro, formerly of Janes Addiction fame, and in 1995, they set about working on the follow up to what was their best album to date. <br />Obviously upon its release, expectations were high. There was obviously going to be a slightly different change in sound, as Frusciante had such a unique style. But the resulting album 'One Hot Minute' was released, and was not well received. The sound of the band had changed quite considerably, and in many peoples eyes, not for the better. However, in my own personal view, this album shows a different side of the Chili's, but not a worse side. I really like the album, its very varied from start to finish. Dark in some places, jovial in others. Here is a summary of my opinions of the tracks.<br />'Warped' - A noisy start to the album, at first it seems a bit too disjointed, but it is definitely a grower, and one of the highlights<BR>'Aeroplane' - A true Chili's classic. Funky as hell, and a great colourful video.<BR>'Deep kick' - Kiedis spends a couple of minutes waffling on about nonsense, before breaking into a bouncy/heavy/funky track<BR>'My Friends' - Ballad number 1 on the album, and almost sounds a little like the classic under the bridge. Nice track.<BR>'Coffee shop' - A great funk rock fest, with bizarre lyrics, and a brilliant slap bass line. Flea at his best!<BR>'Pea' - Flea by himself on bass and vocals, a little silly song against homophobe's! Don't listen with your mum around!<BR>'One big mob' - Another bouncy rock track with more strange lyrics from Kiedis. Also some bizarre sounds in the middle of a crying baby.<BR>'Walkabout' - A brilliant funk-fuelled track. Very simple, groovy walking bass line. Album highlight for me.<BR>'Tearjerker' - Ballad number 2. Apparently written about the late Kurt Cobain, as Kiedis sings 'i like your whiskers, and the dimple in your chin, your pale blue eyes'. A really nice track.<BR>'One hot minute' - I'm not too keen on this title track, mainly for the reason it has a really annoying bit in the middle with 2 notes being repeated over and over and over....<BR>'Falling into Grace' - A nice fairly funky track, with bizarre chanting in the middle of it.<BR>'Shallow be thy game' - Another album highlight, a brilliant funk rock number, and Chili's at their best.<BR>'Transcending' - Peaceful sounding start to the song, but changes into quite an aggressive song by the end. Good song, but strange way to end the album.<br />So, all in all, i do think it is a good album. By no means is it as good as Blood Sugar, but i don't think they will ever better that. I prefer this album to 'Californication' and 'By the way', as its that bit more rocky and funky. if you like the more upbeat side of the Chili's, you will not be disappointed with this. Although the Chili's were going through personal battles with drink and drugs, they still managed to come up with a great album.
B000000XB9|5.0|I like modern rock as much as or more than the next guy. Metallica, Disturbed, Jet, Smashing Pumpkins... all really, really cool bands. But CCR is the reason there ARE bands like that: raw sound, a unique voice (that STILL belts a great record or two nowadays) and great musicianship. All that while creating songs that are more persistent than the cave paintings at Lascuax or the Pyramids. This CD has all the major hits from CCR, including their flawless version of &quot;I Heard It Through The Grapevine&quot; (the fact that John Fogerty sings it &quot;I Hoid It Through The Grapevine&quot; somehow makes it even more appealing, all 11-plus minutes of it). The best thing is that it still sounds fresh. If you're a fan, buy the remasters of the albums. But if you're starting out on CCR (like me), run , do not walk, to buy this album. You can thank me later.
B000058T5E|5.0|All too often, the later albums by rock and jazz legends of the '70s only serve to show their age.  One would think that such artist's vituosity would improve with age and experience, but sadly, that is rarely the case.  This isn't the classic Beck of &quot;Wired&quot; or &quot;Blow by Blow&quot;, but it is just as powerful and vibrant as those albums, and if you liked &quot;Who Else&quot;, it is a fine follow-up.  There is always something worth listening to on a Jeff Beck album, but few are as consistently good as this one.  Hopefully, there is a lot more where this came from.  Contrary to what another reviewer implied, this album will never leave my collection.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|Okay, if you like \\"The Patriot,\\" or any of those pictures that have the settings from 200 years or so ago, then you should like this one as well.<br />If you're a sailor, or into sword fighting, then you too will dig this movie.<br />If you like Russel Crowe, then you will love this flick.<br />It wasn't fully what I expected, but I still injoyed it.<br />How did I do without giving away anything?
B0001DI0FI|5.0|If you're like me and like your action films smart, well written, well acted and with plenty of action; then this is the DVD for you. Chances are if you are thinking of buying this DVD right now you already know this is a great movie, but just in case you're not sure, let me tell you why this is one of those movies that definitely belongs in your collection. <br />The acting, from Russell Crowe (The captain of the HMS Surprise) to Paul Bettany (The ships doctor), down to the most minor character is top notch, and leaves you believing that you are looking through a window in time rather than just watching a Hollywood movie. This film is a historical journey that knocks you back into 18th century naval warfare, and at times with a vengeance. If you happen to own a home theater system (and if you don't you should get one, they're reasonably priced now) you'll be amazed with the sound quality in this film. The action scenes are filled with roaring cannons blasting man and ship into smithereens, ferocious storms at sea where you can almost feel the wind and rain slashing at your face, and fierce pistol/sword fights that fill your senses with the smell of smoke and blood. Like I said at the beginning, if you like action, you've come to the right movie. But read on, it's not all just blood and guts.         <br />What writer/director Peter Weir really does quite masterfully however, is bring you down from all this chaos and conflict with quiet, human, and sometimes humorous scenes that give the viewer an insight into what life on a warship must have been really like in those times. For me, this peek into the world of Captain and Able Seaman alike, is what really sets this movie apart from the ordinary action film. The relationships are well developed and acted to the point where you actually care about the lives of the characters, even the minor ones. The conversations and interactions between the characters on the ship, are believable and interesting, drawing you deep into the story like the novels they are based on. It's this masterful blend of war and peace that makes this movie so commanding (;)). For more than just financial reasons, long ago I decided I was only going to buy the very best movies. The ones that could stand watching over and over again, the ones that could stand the test of time. This is one of those movies.
B0001FR3IQ|5.0|A supremely made horror-suspense motion picture that I found very enjoyable. You won't find any of Halle's soft skin in here, if you want that then view the last 007 flick.<br />You will find this movie keeping you staring into your TV and trying to contemplate what had just happened when that &quot;hook&quot; arrives to interweave into your brain.<br />I found it overall unpredictable.<br />A must see motion picture!
B00008S2VG|5.0|madonna is simply the best, I luv this album, it´s perfect. <br />EVRYBODY COMES TO MADONNAHOOD!!!!
B00005JMCN|5.0|Horse lovers will enjoy this movie easily. Movie lovers should also.<br />It is a drama that is very magical which keeps the viewer's eyes and brain \\"in\\" this motion picture.<br />I didn't expect this picture to be this good. surprise, surprise!
B0001HAISQ|5.0|I took my girls to see this at the theatere, and I had no idea that I would enjoy it so much!! I've been counting down the days until the DVD was released. This movie was worth watching again and again!!
0790729725|5.0|Well, What can i say? I loved it, good plot. Based on a true story, which makes it more exciting and it had many twists. I also liked how the main characters could not be in a family, it gave them a more appealing look.
B0000AQVCL|1.0|Actually at least the boy bands didn't try to pawn themselves off as all hip and retro and holier than thou like these morons. Save your money. God, did Jet ever save lots of money in not paying royalties to AC/DC and Iggy Pop...you might as well too. Go KaZaa crazy, kids.
0385336810|5.0|I was so anxious to read the newest of Sophie Kinsella's books, after having read the Shopaholic Trio.  I was not disappointed...only in the fact that we have to wait for yet another of her books to be published.  She can't crank 'em out fast enough as far as I'm concerned! She has become one of my favorite authors.<BR>Sit down, relax &amp; enjoy away.
B000056K04|4.0|I bought this CD the other day, not because of some review I read but just for the hell of it. I am a fan of DMB, not like some of the diehard, fanatics here on this site, but because I am a fan of good music. I have three DMB CD's in my collection and listen to a wide variety of stuff (Allman Brothers, B.B. King, Jimmy Thackery, Pretenders, Widespread Panic, Goo Goo Dolls, J Geils, Hendrix, AC/DC, Miles Davis, Jimmy Vaughn, Neil Young, Wes Montgomery, etc,etc,etc).<br />I liked Everyday the first time I listened to it. I couldn't wait to hear it again. Didn't matter that it didn't sound like anything they had done before, it was a great CD full of good, soulfull music. <br />So...I decided to check some reviews to see what others thought. Wow!!...from some of the reviews you would think that Dave Matthews himself personally went to these people's homes, beat up their sisters (or brothers), wrecked their new car, and kicked their dogs! What ever happened to appreciating music for what it is, not for what you, the listener, thinks it should be. <br />It was refreshing, however, to see all the good reviews from the rational thinking, music loving people of the world. After listening to Everyday I pulled my Under the Table CD and listened to it. I am anxious to expand my DMB collection again.
B0001HLVS2|3.0|A big-budget entry into the Napoleonic era so well trodden by Horatio Hornblower, \\"Master and Commander\\" falls far short of the hype surrounding its release. While the fantastic historicity of the sets and the salty mood is well done and then maintained throughout, the plot is never given the chance to develop: the viewer is simply thrown into the chase of the French frigate by the HMS Surprise with only a few words typed onscreen to explain what follows for two hours. <br />Additionally, as many reviewers have already noted, a subplot involving the naturalistic interests of the captain's doctor friend stole precious screen time from the rest of the deserving cast.<br />Finally, and most annoyingly, there is an almost complete lack of a proper end to this 2 hour and ten minute feature. Rather than simply ending the film five minutes earlier, the screenwriters inexplicably decided to create a fascinating plot twist...and then leave it dangling!!! I sat in horror whispering to myself, \\"They wouldn't...they couldn't...\\" They did. Without revealing too much, it is not the open-ended finale many initial features end with to allude to a sequel. Instead, the cliffhanger plot twist is never resolved, and the so-called \\"ending\\" falls flat on its face, prompting me to take the time to reveal this embarrassing failure by means of this review.<br />This is not a bad film. It is simply not as good as either it should have been or as it was reported to have been. For all the millions spent on detail and effects, and for all the star-power of Crowe, Ioan Gruffudd and the producers of A & E's Hornblower series outdo this seafaring tale by a wide margin.
B00008US8R|4.0|I enjoyed listening to Fallen. I wish it was a little more upbeat, because if you listen to it long enough, you'll feel like breaking the CD in two and slitting your wrists with it.<BR>Going Under-9/10. I love the instrumentals in this song, they honestly make you want to move.<BR>Bring Me to Life-7.5/10 It's not my favorite. It's an okay song, but it's WAY overplayed, and easy to get sick of.<BR>Everybody's Fool-9/10 I like the sarcasm in this song &quot;Look here she comes now/bow down and stare in wonder&quot;. It's got some great lyrics, but sounds a lot like Imaginary and the beginning of Whisper.<BR>My Immortal-8.5/10. It's a very pretty song and it highlight's Amy Lee's amazing voice, but once again, tis overplayed.<BR>Haunted-9/10 Hard to understand the words in places, but the instrumentals are fabulous and it's a really beautiful, ethereal song.<BR>Tourniquet-9/10. One of my favorite songs, but it doesn't have as good instrumentals as the rest.<BR>Imaginary-7/10. Sounds too much like Everybody's Fool and Whisper but I like the lyrics.<BR>Taking Over Me-10/10. This is my favorite song on the CD. I love the instrumentals and the lyrics-it's a love song with a twist and very cool.<BR>Hello-10/10. Oh my word. I love the lyrics in the song-it's so powerful and very real.<BR>My Last Breath-9/10. Another song of love lost. Interesting lyrics, nice instrumentals.<BR>Whisper-8.5/10-Goes on a REALLY long time. I like the choir and the lyrics though.
B0001KZM3O|4.0|First of all, I wouldn't go as far as to say that the added track is &quot;unecessary&quot; as it was originally supposed to be on this album anyways, and the subject of the song fits quite well with the theme of the album.  Personally, whenever I heard the end of the song, in my mind I expected &quot;The Hero's Return&quot; to begin.<br />I gave the new remaster 4 stars of 5, because they REALLY should have included &quot;The Hero's Return Part 2&quot; ...  Those of you who have heard that bit would probably agree with me on that.<br />Positives though, I have never heard this album sounds as crystal clear...  the entire album doesn't sound even HALF as muddy as it used to.  I didn't know HOW they could've made it better until I actually HEARD it.  There were background vocals and sound effects I only BARELY heard before.  Roger's whispering on parts sounded more like singing.  It's just a beautiful remaster altogether and gave me a new appreciation for this project.
0385512104|5.0|His name is Christopher John Francis Boone. He is fifteen years old, two months and a few days. He is autistic, or more precisely he has Asperger's Syndrome, which is a form of high-functionning autism. He likes regularity, routines, organizes everything in patterns, won't wear or eat anything yellow or brown, likes dogs but doesn't like to be touched by humans, which he has trouble understanding and does not like to make eye contact with them. He lives with his father. He also likes going out at night and walking in the neighbordhood.<BR> <BR>This is how, one night, he discovers Wellington, the neighbor's dog, killed with a gardening fork. This is how he decides to do some detective work, like his idol Sherlock Holmes, whom he likes because he has a sharp mind, to find out who the murderer is. But investigating means going to talk to others, and his fragile world will thus be at stake. At the same time, Christopher, who likes mathematics and science, studies to take A Level Mathematics. <br />The novel is well-written, with information about Asperger's Syndrome. The author worked with autistic children and thus knows a lot about it, which makes the character of Christopher, who is also the narrator, realistic. The sentences are simple, organized, and the text is illustrated by drawings, lists, patterns and formulas.<BR> <BR>The chapters are not titled with cardinal numbers but prime numbers, because Christopher likes them. This is an amazing first novel -- extremely compelling and certainly worth OWNING. (Yes, stop borrowing books!) Don't miss your chance to pick up a copy! You'll enjoy this book greatly! Another Amazon quick pick I'd like to recommend is WILL@epicqwest.com by Tom Grimes, another very original, highly entertaining read.
0689859368|3.0|It seems that this book is well written but that the author is getting more money for less product. Length isn't always important with \\"great\\" literature, I mean look at The Old Man and the Sea, or possibly the Cat in the Hat, both important pieces of lit (in different ways) but both are very short. So what's the difference. How about a complete development of characters, getting your moneys worth etc. If this book had been of a respectable length it would probably be recieving a five today, alas.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|It seems almost redundant to talk about how amazing a film Sergio Leone's masterpiece, \\"Once Upon a Time in the West\\" is. So much has already been said about it by the many filmmakers, scholars, and film lovers whom it affected deeply. The film transcends the negative `Spaghetti Western' label so hastily slapped on the many Euro-Westerns that appeared in the late 1960. Yes, many of these movies were trashy and low-quality, but there were also many great films, and \\"Once Upon a Time in the West\\" reigns supreme amongst them. In it, Leone, who had previously helmed the \\"Dollars\\" trilogy with Clint Eastwood, achieves a sublime level of mythic poetry, reaching into the realms of the Western as fantasy fairy-tale. He touches on the themes of almost all Westerns that came before it, references many classic American Westerns, and crafts it all into a tale of the men and women who built the open West and who then watched its demise under the new forces of civilization. Leone's film is almost choreographed, like a dance of death between the four fascinating main characters: Jill, prostitute-turned-homemaker (Claudia Cardinale); Frank, the ruthless killer hired by the railroads `to remove small objects from the track' (Henry Fonda, in the surprise role of his career); Cheyenne, the rough and comic outlaw (Jason Robards); and the mysterious, implacable gunman known to everyone only as `Harmonica,' (Charles Bronson) who's lonesome wail on the instrument is the eerie signature sound of the film. The lives of these four collide in the Arizona desert (filmed alternately in Spain and Monument Valley, Utah), against the backdrop of the arrival of the railroad, and slowly work out their destinies in the dying West.<br />This DVD was a long time coming. MGM quickly released the three Leone-Eastwood films to DVD, but Paramount took its time getting around to the director's greatest work. However, the special edition was worth the wait. The two-disc set is loaded with fantastic extras. The transfer in widescreen is glorious (and to think for years we had to watch it cropped for TV!), the new 5.1 sound mix showcases Leone's brilliant use of sound effects and propels Ennio Morricone's legendary score to the operatic height it deserves. The audio commentary track splits between numerous individuals. Much of the talking is done by Leone experts Sir Christopher Frayling and Dr. Sheldon Hall. Their comments sometimes fall into play-by-play, over-explaining the actions on the screen, but they do provide many fascinating facts about the making of the movie (filming locations, set design, the actors), mentions of the many other Westerns that the film quotes, and observations on Sergio Leone's unique style. There are also brief interruptions from directors who are Leone fans or who knew him personally, such as John Milius, John Carpenter, Alex Cox, and Bernardo Bertolucci (who wrote the screen story of the film along with Dario Argento). All have interesting stories to tell (Carpenter is pretty funny, since he admits he hasn't seen the film in a while, and is quite amused by what he sees). Cardinale pops in very briefly to talk about the love scene between her and Henry Fonda.<br />The second disc contains a lengthy documentary, which goes into great depth on the making of the film. All the speakers from the commentary take part in the interviews, and they are joined by actor Gabriele Ferzetti (who plays Mr. Morton in the film), composer Ennio Morricone, and archival interviews with Henry Fonda and Sergio Leone himself. The only problem with the documentary is the artificial separation of it into three sections. Another documentary provides historical background on the coming of the railroad, and adds extra perspective on the film's story. There's also a feature that allows you to compare the filming locations in Monument Valley to what they look like today, the original U.S. trailer, and a stills gallery. All around, great bonus material for a film that deserves them.<br />For those of you who have never seen \\"Once Upon a Time in the West,\\" I envy your first experience with it. It moves slowly, deliberately, with time and suspense stretched out and distended to their limits, but even if you think you have a short attention span, it's impossible not to fall under Leone's spell of Western ritual, close-ups, wide-spanning landscape shots, sudden explosions of violence, and his ability to inject doses of mythic wonder into every single shot. And if you've already a fan of this film, this DVD set is a dream come true. Buy it, invite all your friends over, and introduce them to the best Euro-Western ever produced.
0380729407|5.0|Something Wicked This Way Comes, is one of the most amazing books ever written ever! &quot;By the pricking of my thumbs, Something wicked this way comes.&quot; Every time I hear that saying I think of this book written by Ray Bradbury. Also I think that it was kind of odd how Mr. Dark used the diguise of being the lightning rod salesman, and how Jim and Will found out all the secrets of the mirors and the mazes and the fariswheel. All that Mr. Dark and Mr. Cooger were trying to do were to take the peoples souls and trade them for what they (the people) wished for the most as in their sins. To all that haven't read this book should really read it because it will make you interested in it more and more...page after page. This book is one of the best ever written and it will make you more interested in it because of all what happens it makes you wander whats going to happen to Jim and Will next, so it keeps you gessing, and it makes you wander if Will and Jim will make it out alive or dead!! Who know till you read it, so go out and read it for my sake and for yours.
B000056HEC|5.0|It always pisses me off when people give The Matrix as a philosophical movie, when there are so many much more rich sources of artistic exploration. 12 Angry Men is one such example, a great movie about epistemology. <br />During an unseen trial, a young man of a negatively-seen ethnicity (which is never specified) is accused of the murder of his father. It is an &quot;open and shut case&quot;, and all the jurors agree that he is guilty, except juror #8, played by Henry Fonda. <br />In 95 minutes, almost shot in real-time, we observe as the jurors' prejudices and emotions churn and crash in mighty waves, as each piece of evidence is examined and examined again, as every actor plays against the others. In the process, we witness an object-lesson in epistemology : what is doubt, what is evidence, how do we prove or disprove a proposition, and how people in groups act in group dynamics that sometimes are not conductive to the truth. <br />Politically speaking, 12 Angry Men is a testimony against juries and capital punishment, but that is not the point of the movie. It is a movie about how we judge events and how we filter the truth. And that's something that you won't get from any action movie.

B00008976Y|5.0|The most obvious association we have with blue is depression. In the three colours of the French Republic, blue stands for freedom. Trois Couleurs : Bleu is about both. More precisely, it is an exploration of what personal freedom means, and if we can find it in a social context where we cannot live without relationships. <br />The female character of Bleu is Julie (played by Juliette Binoche), who is part of a car accident where her husband and daughter both die. The husband was a famous composer, and was working on a piece for the European Union's inauguration : his co-worker is in love with her and becomes her very temporary lover. As in &quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot;, the accident is not a focal point made to display special effects, but a motor of narrative. Julie desires to start a new life where she has no more links to anything. <br />While it is laudable to once again see a moral balance being drawn, it is tiring to see how much movie-makers want to make their characters start from a position of over-independence, instead of over-dependence. About a Boy is another good example. Nevertheless, Blue provides an elegant philosophical exploration of the same issues, superior in most ways to the latter movie. <br />In some ways it is also spiritual : not only in the beautiful esthetics of the movie or how it shows the interconnections people's lives, but it is also hard not to compare Julie's attempts at complete detachment with the most moderate eschewing of attachment as proposed by Buddhist doctrine (indeed, the ending of Bleu could be interpreted as supporting this moderate view).

B0001GL3K4|4.0|Love Actually is a anthology of several stories into one movie.  In theory, any one of them could have been developed into a film by itself; but the entertainment is in the switching back and forth between plotlines.<br />All these stories come together on Christmas Eve in expected and some unexpected ways at the end of the film.  Some are not charmed by this \\"cut and paste\\" of storylines into one film.  They complain that none of the individual plots holds much interest for a movie by themselves and do not work when all jumbled together.  But they miss the point.  It is not meant to be taken seriously.  All these plots are played for humor and bits of sentimental warmth.  As a whole Love Actually makes for fun and enchanting movie watching.<br />American viewers may have been turned away from \\"Love Actually\\" because this is a very English movie.  Aside from a few pokes at Americans and the jarring outburst against American foreign policy, a little forbearing toward the cultural divide pays off greatly.  None of the English accents are difficult to follow as some English films in the past have been.  The rather liberal use of the \\"f***\\" word and nudity may mean you don't invite Grandma and Grandpa over for family movie night.  But Love Actually is well worth the purchase and repeated viewings.
B0000TAZBK|5.0|Before The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, I never paid much attention to Howard Shore, but after I heard his excellent score, I started paying more attention. The Fellowship was the first of the Trilogy and as such, Shore established his themes for the landbreaking film. The music revolves around five basic themes: The theme for Isengard, the theme for the Black Riders/Mordor, the theme for the Fellowship, the theme for the Ring and the theme for The Shire. The range of music is extremely wide. The Black Rider theme is a very dark, gothic theme, while the Hobbit theme is very light and playful reminiscent of an old countryside folktune. The theme for Isengard is very strident percussion and brass with emphasize the evil building under Orthanc. The Fellowship theme is a very bold theme, only heard in its full glory 2 times on the soundtrack on tracks 11 and 13. The hints of most of these themes play in almost all the tracks of the film, however all of these tracks stand alone.  Choir is used effectively to heighten the emotion of any particular track. The cd is over 70 minutes long, and I wish it could be longer simply because the music is so enjoyable. Shore's score to this epic film belongs on the top ten score's of all time and it truly deserved the Academy Award that it won. It is simply magnificent!<BR> <BR>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers soundtrack is 1) an excellent score cd 2) a worthy companion to its predecessor the Academy Award winning The Fellowship of the Ring. Howard Shore returns to write the music for the next chapter of Jackson's films. The Two Towers has a mixture of new and old themes. Enya, a fixture on the Fellowship soundtrack is not featured on the Two Towers soundtrack. The Fellowship theme, the Isengard theme, the Rivendell theme, the Mordor theme, and the Shire theme all make reappearances, but added amongst them and comprising most of the cd are new themes. The Rohan theme is a very Vikingish theme replete with strings and percussion. Shore has the ability to vary the mood of this theme, usin it at the triumph of Theoden's reawakening as well as at the defeat of the evacuation of Meduseld. Treebeard's theme, is a very soft kind of &quot;forresty&quot; music with a chorus to give it a mysterious air. Shore uses heavy percussion to make the theme more effective. Arwen's theme is different from the first soundtrack, first because there is no Enya and second because its more of a melancholy love theme. Gollum's theme also doubles as the Ring theme from the first film, but the way Shore plays this theme reflects the 2 sides of Gollum's personality. As in the Fellowship, Shore uses different choirs very effectively, giving the elves an ethereal sounding choir, etc.  The Two Towers is an excellent cd, and while it does not surpass the Fellowship of the Ring soundtrack it is its equal. <br />After hearing Howard Shore's stunning conclusion to Perter Jackson's epic Lord of the Rings trilogy, I can only state one thing: Excellent. Excellent doesn't really do justice to the magnificence of Shore's work.  Shore presents a much more mature version of work. All our favorite themes are there: The Fellowship theme has now evolved into a wistful yet powerful fanfare for Aragorn. The Shire theme makes a return as does the Hobbit theme, both played magnificently by James Galway. Also returning is the Mordor theme, it's menacing notes now grown into a malevolent force. The Rohan theme also makes a brief reappearance, while the elvish theme comes to a full circle, representing Aragorn as he gets his sword in the track Andruil. The beginning of the cd is much more playful than that of the Two Towers, but it swiftly transforms into a majestic fanfare for Minas Tirith and Gondor which is among the greatest moments on the cd. Once again Enya does not sing on this cd, but in a suprisingly powerful decision, Billy Boyd aka Pippin does appear, singing briefly for Lord Denethor, capturing the rift between the Steward and Faramir. In track 17, The Return of the King, Shore takes a listener on a journey of all his developed themes for our heroes. Like his previous two Lord of the Ring scores, Shore writes so the listener see's. What I mean is that the music and the movie work so well together, that one actually envisions the beacons being lit at Minas Tirith or Eowyn swinging Merry unto her horse as the Rohirram ride out to Gondor. Faramir's deadly attack on Osgiliath and the appearance of Theoden at dawn come vividly to life, but most moving and most emotional is track 15, beginning with the Fellowship fanfare as Aragorn exorts his soldiers to fight and ending with a new theme as Sam picks up Frodo and says, &quot;I can't carry It for you, but I can carry you!&quot; It's enough to bring the listener to tears. As for Oscar-winning the song at the end by Annie Lennox, it captures triumph and tragedy of the conclusion of the Lord of the Rings. I was only disappointed by there not being more music to hear. I truly hope a complete soundtrack is released containing all the music from the films.
B00004ZB9D|4.0|Lenny Kravitz is one of those rockers who has something in common with Frank Sinatra, he does things his way. In the early nineties when grunge was the ruling trend Kravitz wanted to express rock n' roll full of hope and questions, much like his heroes from the 1960's. Yet his work doesn't sound like hippie statements or retreads, eventhough he is a perfect hybrid of Jimi Hendrix and John Lennon. At the end of the day Lenny Kravitz is simply a really good songwriter able to kick out the jams, giving us songs that are never boring even in their moments of passive reflection. This &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; collection is a summation of some of Kravitz's best work, it's an equal dose of his driven rockers and his dreamy ballads. The set opens with the exciting &quot;Are You Gonna Go My Way,&quot; a dizzying jam with a catchy guitar lick and snappy drums. The hit &quot;Fly Away&quot; is here with it's enrapturing sounds and images, it literally embodies the work &quot;escape.&quot; The feeling you get from the set is that these songs are about playing good music the right way. The production in almost every track is flawless. Take &quot;Again&quot; for example, at first it may seem like a typical &quot;i miss you&quot; song, but it's really a beautifully-produced track in every area of the vocals, instrumentals, melody and lyrics. With &quot;American Woman&quot; Kravitz proves he's also great at covering other people's material, his version totally rocks with it's crunching guitars and in-your face vocals. If &quot;American Woman&quot; is a modern update of a 60's song, then &quot;Let Love Rule&quot; is a throwback to that decade. With it's hopeful message on love and brotherhood and that organ it sounds like a modern take on the Beatles. But it works. The only week moments in the collection are songs that don't seem to have the same amount of effort put into the best tracks. &quot;Black Velveteen&quot; is some kind of robotic futuristic trip that never goes anywhere musically or otherwise. Lenny Kravitz is a great musician backed by a first rate band and anyone who wants a taste of what the guy has to offer should check this CD out.
0679720200|5.0|To the people who gave this book 1 star, I must say that none of you have the faintest idea of the true meaning of the book.  Most people claimed it was depressing and lacked emotion.  Well news flash, a book isn't good just because it makes you feel happy, and the converse is true as well.  The main character lacks emotion for a reason, that is the key to Camus' theme.  In his final moments of life, Mersault realizes why his mother became engaged in the twilight of her years.  It's because she realizes that she cannot be phased by death.  It is predestined that life will come to an end for every human being, and we must learn to shed the false hope that we will live forever.  Only than can we truly be free.
B000148KK2|1.0|Being a long time Diana Krall fan, I am diappointed in her latest CD. The music is good, but this isn't anywhere near a jazz recording. But when you listen to the words it's more in a sad, depressing pop song genre. I didn't catch any real emotion in any of the songs. <br />If you take away the words to most of the songs, this recording has some merit. The band is great.
1592400876|1.0|As a secondary school teacher for longer than I care to admit, I am delighted to see that a subject as staid as grammar can excite even adults. Kudos to this book for demonstrating that fact. But what a shame that the book has so little bearing on the way we use English in America - and has grammatical errors as well. Read this only for entertainment, but use authoritative sources if you intend to write or speak as Americans do.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|There's a reason that over eight hundred people have taken the time to write glowing reviews about this show.  Firefly is that good.  The characters are three-dimensional, the acting is strong and the special effects are amazing.  <br />The only downside to the series is that it was cancelled before we got to see how many of the story lines would play out (i.e. what did the Blue Sun corporation do to River and what did Shepherd Book do before he joined the Church).  With &quot;Serenity&quot; set to hit theaters next year, we may get answers to a few of these questions, and who knows?  A strong showing at the box office may lead to a revival of the series on a better network than Fox.<br />I would strongly urge those of you hesitant to watch a &quot;space western&quot; to give Firefly a chance.  You'll be glad you did, and you just might join the growing population of Firefly fanatics.
B00007GZR0|4.0|The movie is very funny, with Rock Hudson playing a hypochondriac named George. He is at a doctors appointment, when he overhears the doctor discussing a dying patient on the telephone. Immediately, he assumes he is the dying one. He then starts searching for a new husband for his wife with the help of his friend Arnold. The only problem is that Arnold must say the name George at least 10,000 times. It can get exsaperating. Overall, it is a very funny movie, but kind of gets of out hand at the end.
B000002H2Z|5.0|This isn't the best Cure album by any means, but boy is it good.  It's one of those RARE albums where every track is listenable (and re-listenable).  I disagree with those who say THOTD is incoherent, part of it's charm is the fact that it takes you to different places.  However, this is an exceptionally short affair, and when the final track &quot;Sinking&quot; closes out, it leaves you wanting more.  Just listen to &quot;Push&quot;, &quot;The Blood&quot;, or &quot;The Baby Screams&quot; and realize that you will never be that creative.  Best songs are all of them, end of story.  If you don't own THOTD, you should!
B000002B7S|5.0|This album is kind of different than Ozzy's previous two or any to follow. It is very good though. It is a little more pop oriented, and a little more moody. Jake Lee's guitar playing is just as good as anything, though. Center Of Enternity is the best song on the album, and one of Ozzy's all-time best. Some lame songs, like So Tired keep this from being Ozzy's best album ever . I love all of it, though. The title track is one of Ozzy's most famous songs, and it is very good.
B00005JMEW|5.0|This is his greatest movie yet! I'm anti-viloence, but this was gratuitous art! It was ridiculing a genre, while complimenting the actors. Quentin takes his actors to the edge, which makes them believable and great. He also gives the premise of child abuse, and gratuitous violence being done to the present day vipers that we see. This gives reason, heart, soul and compassion to all villians. Monsters are not born, but created from molesting dysfuntion. He is like God,the third author omniscient, finding forgiveness for even the worst sinner!
0312955006|4.0|I have read many many thriller novels and for some reason have only recently discovered Connelly who is the Grand Master.<br />Concrete Blonde is one of the best Bosch books and I recomend ot anyone to start with &quot;Black Echo&quot; and read each one in chronological order.  I love so many things about this book and about the whole Bosch series!!
6304938241|5.0|I love the premise of this story, very intriguing: a rich young woman named Milly is dying and her best friend Kate senses that Milly is in love with her boyfriend, Martin, so out of compassion (and hopes that she will leave Martin all her money when she dies), Kate works out a calculating plan to get Martin and Milly together. One problem, they start falling for each other, and Kate starts getting jealous, afraid that she will lose Martin's love. The last sequence of the film was riveting, and the final scene was simply heart-stopping. It'll make you gulp and sigh.<br />David Rehak<BR>author of &quot;Love and Madness&quot;
B0001HAISG|5.0|I have been a fan of Peter Pan my entire life. Some of my earliest memories are of watching Mary Martin play Peter in the ledgendary tv version from 1960. I also own the Disney cartoon version (which is boring in comparison to this one), and i'm one of the only people in the world who loved the movie Hook. So, I have pretty high standards when it comes to this story. I have to admit, I wasn't expecting much after reading mixed reviews, but I was BLOWN AWAY!!!!   I don't even know where to begin..Jeremy Sumpter is absolutely ADORABLE and is perfect for the role of Peter. You can really see his cockiness in the begining of the movie, but then you see his fears and insecurities as the movie progresses. Rachel is astounding as Wendy. She plays up the conflict Wendy has: Wanting to stay a child, but, then she falls for Peter and realizes what she would miss by not growing up. The chemistry between these two is really something. I LOVE When Wendy turns to look back in the nursery before she flies away, and Peter comes up behind her and whispers, \\"we'll never have to worry about grown-up things again!\\" This is the only version where you really see Peter and Wendy falling in love.    I wondered how the scene with Tinkerbell's death would be handled. Would Peter turn to the audience and ask them to clap? That wouldn't fit in with this version. Instead, we simply have Peter (along with Wendy and the Lost Boys )chanting, \\"I DO believe in faeries! I DO! I do!\\" over and over again, with children from around the country joining in, and it is really effective.     I could ramble on and on about this movie, but, I'll just wrap this up by saying, everyonbe should see this!! As if the movie wasn't great, there are some very interesting extras too!! What are you waiting for? Buy this movie NOW!!!
B0001JXQEM|5.0|Nothing in this review is going to say somthing that hasen't been said. That said, this one of the classic albums to own. Like a fine wine, this CD gets better with age. Its hard to imagine the first days I heard &quot;Buddy Holly&quot; and &quot;Say It Ain't So.&quot; Many bands try to duplicate them, but there is only one Weezer. The best song on the Album is &quot;The World Has Turned and Left Me Here.&quot; Whether rocking out or chilling out, this guys always find a way to put a smile on my face. The digital remastering and bonus disk only add to an already awsome package. &quot;Jamie&quot; is another hidden classic. Buy this album without hesitation.
B000148KK2|4.0|My appreciation for Diana Krall has grown over time, and I eagerly anticipated this new cd.  I had a feeling it was going to be very different from her other recordings, so I wasn't surprised.  As I have listened to each song, I hear more of her in them.  I am a lover of the standards she normally records, but I feel as though I am getting more of a glimpse of her in these new songs.  And I think it is always good when an artist shakes things up and tries new styles.  To me that reveals a true artist and musician.  As long as I hear her wonderful piano styles, I am happy.  That's what you hear on this along with many other wonderfully talented people.  If I could, I would give a standing ovation.
6305897786|5.0|I love &quot;The Ninth Gate&quot;.  I have seen it many times since I first rented it back in the summer of 2000, and after buying it about a year or so later I have always made it a point to view it regularly.  Director Roman Polanski has given us another masterpiece of horror with some good touches of comedy, all wrapped up in a cloak of atmosphere so thick that you could cut it with a knife.  While I am not a die-hard fan of Polanski in the way I am with directors such as Tim Burton, I have seen and enjoyed very much three of his films: &quot;Rosemary's Baby&quot;, &quot;The Fearless Vampire Killers&quot;, and &quot;Frantic&quot;, and have observed elements found in each of those three movies to be definitely present in this one.  &quot;The Ninth Gate&quot; obviously has its maker's fingerprints all over it, which is good news for fans of his work.<br />&quot;The Ninth Gate&quot; works great as a detective story, which is really what it is more a horror film.  Johnny Depp, my favorite actor hands down, takes us on a bizarrely fascinating journey through Portugal and France hoping to track down two of the three remaining copies of a book apparantly written by Satan himself during the Middle Ages.  Along the way, we watch him being followed and see some suspicious setbacks occur, along with his dealings with his employer, a millionaire Satanist by the name of Boris Balkan.  <br />The good things I have to say about this film: first, the directing is fantastic, atmospheric and spellbinding.  You will be totally immersed in the goings-on of this film, in spite of its numerous quiet and thoughtful moments and overall slow-moving nature.  The European location work is gorgeous ... we see some beautiful and sinister cities, castles, and countrysides.  The movie looks and feels great.  Also, a bizarre and interesting choice was made to cast the same man as four different characters, who(m) we meet two at a time, first and then again later, in the same location.  Was thissupposed to be symbolic or indicate something implicitly to the audience?<br />Second, the musical score by a fellow named Wojciech Kilar is beautiful; its haunting, subtle, and quiet.  It perfectly accents the scenes it plays behind, in no way upstaging the action or even drawing attention to itself.  Also, I loved the soloist (a Korean girl, I understand) who sang during the opening and ending credits.  I find it appalling that during the trailers advertising this film, they played some awful new-metal-crud in an effort to get all the MTV kids into the theater.  As awful as this was, I am very thankful that none of this music found its way into the movie itself ... it would be entirely inappropriate.  Kilar's compositions are spot-on perfect, and nothing else should have been used.<br />Third, I was really taken by the fascinating artwork done for the engravings.  They were almost tarot-cardish, and very bizarre.  I particularly liked the one of the guy hanging by his foot from a noose (and the way it figured into a later scene after we see it for the first time) and the image of the maze with the castle turrets.  The moment when we see the initials &quot;LCF&quot; in tiny letters hidden on particular ones was absolutely chilling.<br />Fourthly and finally, in spite of the fact that Johnny Depp is my favorite actor, I must say that it was Frank Langella as Boris Balkan who stole this movie away.  Balkan is a fascinating character, from his special library (did anyone notice the passcode he entered to unlock its door?) to his attitude toward phony Satanists (his little &quot;Boo!&quot; moment was classic), all the way to his unfortunate end.  His dedication to his beliefs could be both inspiring and frightening (check out what he says to Corso, Depp's character, when he tells him that the book has been stolen from his hotel room), and I enjoyed every moment that had him on the screen.  Langella's Balkan definitely comes away as this movie's most memorable character.  I am now very interested in seeing the version of &quot;Dracula&quot; he did back in the 1970s.<br />One final thing: I found interesting the director's choice to present Satanism in a more objective light than would normally done in films such as these.  I understand that Polanski really has no religious beliefs, so as far as he's concerned one is as good as another.  While I do not agree with this, it certainly makes for an interesting and original approach to the subject matter, and really works for this movie's benefit. <br />Give &quot;The Ninth Gate&quot; a try today.  The DVD has some good extras, including a nice commentary with the director, and the film itself has a very high rewatchablity factor.  You'll find yourself wanting to put this one into the player again and again as time goes on, and you'll find something new to enjoy about it every time.  Go for it!  You'll thank me.<br />Carry on Carry on,<br />MN
055321277X|4.0|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was a wonderful book.  It expressed how the string of good and evil are attached, and how different people express themselves in different ways.  I think that Dr. Jekyll released all his negitive energy through Hyde so that he would not be know as a evil person.  this book made me realize that I dont need to keep negitive feelings bottled up inside because it only leads to bad things in the end and you  do not get anything good out of it.  Every person needs to read this book.  It will give you a sense of adventure and let you explore into the life of scientist and science.  I would definately recommend  it to anyone interested in the supernatural.
B00003CXE7|5.0|I am a big fan of Ridley Scott's work.  Alien and Thelma and Louise were wonderful, and he definately made a great comeback in this film.  Gladiator is one of the grandest movies.  The places that this movie takes you is almost like you are there.  The fight scenes were very real and dramatic.  Russel Crowe was destined to play Maximus.  He outshined Mel Gibson's role in Braveheart.  Jacquin Pheonix played a wonderful villain in the film as well.  This definately every Academy Award that it received.  This movie is the greatest film based on the Roman times other than Ben Hur.  I highly reccomend this film.

B00009UW0N|5.0|This is what I would like to call a perfect film.  There is nothing wrong with it.  The acting is natural.  The cinamatography is spooky and inticing.  The score is bone chilling.  Everything about this film is good.  Michael Myers is one of the scariest villains the movies has ever seen.  Jaimie Lee Curtis did a wonderful breakout role in this film.  Donald Pleasance gave the greatest performance of his career.  The movie is one of the best films of the 70s and definately the greatest horror film of them all.  &quot;every one is entitled to one good scare&quot;
1594200106|4.0|Reading \\"The Shadow Of The Wind\\" was both a delight and a disappointment. This novel had the potential to be excellent literary fiction. At times Carlos Ruiz Zafon's writing reminded me of both Gabriel Garcia Marquez's and Jorge Luis Borges' work. My expectations rose dramatically as I began to hope for more than a good read. Instead of great literature, however, the novel became an overlong and predictable bestseller, with a most original premise, some brilliant passages and many flaws.<br /><br />Sr. Ruiz Zafon's extraordinary idea of creating a Cemetery of Forgotten Books, a labyrinthian library where each book awaits someone to choose it and give it another chance to live by making it part of the new owner's life, gave me chills. There existed a possibility, as I read the first chapters, that I might be able to list this as one of my favorite works of fiction. Unfortunately, my disappointment when reaching the novel's conclusion overshadowed the book's many positive elements.<br /><br />Daniel Sempere is a young boy who fears he has forgotten the image of his dead mother's face. His compassionate father, an antiquarian book dealer, introduces him to the book cemetery. Daniel and Sr. Sempere are both memorable and unusual characters, as are many of Ruiz Zafon's other figures. Fermin, a former Republican agent who becomes a second father to Daniel, and Julian Carax, the author of the book Daniel selects, are both extraordinary men. Daniel's choice of books ultimately determines the course of his life, as he tries to discover if the author is still alive and solve the multitude of mysteries surrounding him. The setting, post-WWII Barcelona, is fascinating and Zafon depicts a brooding city in mourning as a result of the atrocities of both civil and world wars. The rich plot and various subplots, filled with passion, obsession and revenge, have such potential but become terribly convoluted and lose coherence at times. There is much too much information given about some of the characters, their rationales, and oddly enough, about an ancient, haunted house. Much of the mysterious ambiance is lost as a result of all the unwieldy description. Here, the concept \\"less is more\\" would have strongly improved the narrative. The entire novel could have been cut by a third, perhaps, and made a better, tighter book without losing any of the story or character development. I am a big fan of long, juicy novels, but the length should have a purpose and enhance the tale. The author has focused more on the melodramatic rather than the literary elements. Some may not care, as this is an excellent read. I did care though, as I see so much more potential here and hope the author lives up to it next time.<br /><br />I do recommend \\"The Shadow Of The Wind.\\" Most will find it highly enjoyable, as did I.

B00009W0WM|5.0|As time goes by, Casablanca is a film that will never die.  It is my favorite film of all time.  Everything about this film is wonderful.  The set, the drama, the acting, the music, and the cinamatography all whisk you away to another era.  The film has everything a moviegoer wants.  It has action, mystery, drama, romance, and at times it is even funny.  Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman were the only ones I think that could play these roles right.  They were a match made in heaven.  They are probably a better on screen couple than Vivian Leigh and Clark gable.  This is a timeless piece of film that everybody should see.
B00008ADPF|1.0|Nickelback is the very prototype of corporate rock: They're playing a style of music that has already been played to death, only they're even more commercial and radio-friendly than their influences, and their trite, simplistic lyrics (i.e. &quot;I like your pants around your feet / I like the dirt that's on your knees&quot;) also give them widespread appeal.  Essentially, Nickelback has no important statements to make, and nothing relevant to contribute to music as an art form - they're just a mindless corporate rock entity that's perfect for cranking up REALLY loud at your next fraternity party.<br />The band's fourth release, The Long Road, finds Nickelback rehashing the same themes and sounds as albums prior - is it just me, or do &quot;How You Remind Me&quot; and &quot;Someday&quot; sound like practically the same song?  Go figure - leave it to corporate hacks like these guys to go and rewrite their hit songs.  Frontman Chad Kroeger's angst comes off as artificial and contrived - rather than covering themes of abusive relationships and his father not being there when he needed him, now he's upset because of his band's touring commitments.  I can't wait for Nickelback's next album - perhaps Kroeger will be irate about spilling a glass of milk, or maybe running out of cigarettes will ruin his day the next time around.  <br />The bland watered-down fourth-tier grunge of Silver Side Up has been diluted even further, making the album even more accessible to adult contemporary audiences - one can imagine just as many soccer moms going to their concerts as frat boys.  I don't picture this album as warranting repeated listening either: They made the mistake of putting the one energetic track on the album (&quot;Flat On The Floor&quot;) at the very beginning - after that it's a monotonous stream of mid-tempo mediocrity ... if they had any idea of how to sequence an album, they would have put that track somewhere in the middle.<br />In summary: Nickelback doesn't fix what isn't broken - it's another album of slick, polished pseudo-grunge that takes even fewer chances than their previous releases.  All the polish and glitz of this album's production can't hide the weak songwriting and unoriginality of this band.
0345440757|5.0|This book is truely a blessing.  It takes a middle road approach to two sides of the parenting decisions we have to make as parents.  The advice is easy to follow and is just plain common sense.  This is NOT a schedule!  It's a routine!  It just doing the same types of activies (eating, activity, sleeping, and you-time) in the same order and not depending on a clock!  It is about meeting your babies needs first and by doing that you have to learn what your baby is telling you he/she needs.  And by putting your child on a routine you have a little bit of help since you and your baby both know what is going on and what is going to happen next.  Instead of letting the baby control your life, you give your baby some structure, but it's all very flexible.<BR>Some of the best advice for me in this book was to do what best fit my family best and not worry about what other people think because what works best for your family may fail miserably in mine and vice versa.  There's nothing wrong with doing things different and you need not feel guilt over it since every person is different, every family will be too!<BR>Tracy gives you her &quot;secrets&quot; of what she does and the frame work and then lets you go and have the joy of discovering what your baby and family will now be like with a new bundle of joy.<BR>You will probably like this book if you are frustrated with the battle going on over &quot;co-sleeping, feed-on-demand&quot; and &quot;Ferberizing&quot; your baby and neither seems like the solution for you.  You probably won't like this book if you are hard-core one way or another on the issues of sleep and feeding.
B000066NW0|1.0|With the whirlwind of press and media attention she has received, you would think that Avril Lavigne was some kind of monumental talent.  But no - basically Let Go sounds like it came from Britney Spears's bratty older sister.  Lavigne might like going around in spiked bracelets and Dickies talking about how &quot;hardcore&quot; she is, but the truth is her punk rock influences are only skin deep.  She dresses the part, but if you're expecting lyrics about challenging the establishment and music other than what you hear on your local &quot;soft rock&quot; station, you are bound to be disappointed.  I'm willing to bet that when asked what her favorite punk rock band is, she would respond by saying &quot;Blink 182&quot; - she hasn't a clue about the genre which she claims to represent.  For more on this topic, take a look at my Simple Plan review.<br />If there were any doubts about which genre Lavigne belongs in, one listen to the album clears them up - it's teen pop.  From the childish, Britney-like &quot;life's like this&quot; intro to &quot;Complicated&quot; to the embarrassingly immature lyrics of &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot; (complete with the obligatory kiss up to MTV), it's hard to imagine anyone over 17 listening to this without cringing in horror.  The pitiful lyrics don't end there - here's some examples: &quot;I never spend less than an hour / Washin' my hair in the shower / It always takes five hours to make it straight /  So I'll braid it in a zillion braids&quot; (from &quot;My World&quot;) ... &quot;I'm not the milk and cheerios in your spoon /It's not a simple here we go not so soon&quot; (from &quot;Nobody's Fool&quot;) ... &quot;If you don't care / Then I don't care / We're not going anywhere&quot; (from &quot;Losing Grip&quot;).  Let's not forget about the song where Lavigne states that she wants to be &quot;anything but ordinary&quot; - if that's the case, she failed miserably with this album.<br />In summary: An album that anyone older than 12 should'vebeen embarrassed to attach their name to, Let Go is a weak debut from an artist (using the word loosely) that has received far too much undeserved acclaim.  Nothing on this album justifies the press she's received along with her astronomical sales numbers, so I suggest you pass on this one.
B00005JM02|5.0|I love this movie and we watch it over and over again.  The characters are really and believeable (as far as talking fish can be believeable.)  The boy who does the voice for Nemo does a great job at \\"not\\" acting.  He even kind of stammers when talking about Sandy Plankton in the beginning of the movie which makes his character even more real.  The visuals are awesome, although, they really need to work on making the actual people look better and not so computer generated.  The plot good for little kids though a little lacking for me.  When Marlin (the dad) and Nemo finally meet up again there is little emotional rejoicing on my part.  It seems as though the moment was a little overdue.  The humor in the movie is funny and keeps me laughing even after watching it several times.  <BR>On behalf of my 2 year-old son I must say that he does enjoy this movie, especially the sharks.  He is a little scared by Bruce until he starts laughing then my son starts laughing.  It's also a great way to introduce him to some underwater life.  <BR>Pixar does give this film a different feel that the light-hearted predecessors, but that's not a bad thing.  If that's what you are looking for it this movie you may be disappointed in the offering.  Just like with music and musicians each release should (hopefully) offer the public something different and not the same product just repackaged. Pixar contiunes to bring high quality films with high quality stories to families and I will continue looking forward to their next release.
B00005BJ9W|5.0|Duran Duran is the epitome of synthpop/new wave 80's. One of the most influential bands of the that decade.  This is 1 of  their best albums by far. We all know they have had  numerous hit songs \\"Planet Earth\\" being 1 of my faves too many to mention but this CD you will not skip a track. The production is amazing it was ahead of it's time with  synths and drumbeats. Every song is catchy and you can sing every track on this album. The breakout dance singles \\"Hungry like the wolf\\"  & \\"Rio\\" are incredibly catchy but \\"Save a prayer\\" is my favorite on cd the lyrics bring you right there as if your going through the same thing he is. Simon Lebon has a good voice the soft ballad \\"Lonely in my nightmare\\" The album incorporates it all dance, ballads, & synthpop/punk. Essential cd to collection for any one who grew up in the new wave 80's decade.
B000148KK2|4.0|I have been a Diana Krall fan for a long time, and have most of her albums as well as the `Live in Paris' DVD (which by the way is superb). <br />I think that this new album is a bitter sweet change from her previous works. Although the Jazz purists will view it with contempt, I say it's well worth buying. It's a perfect album for chilling out on the weekend with an appropriate glass of wine in hand.<br />I don't believe Diana's gone down the Norah Jones path as some would suggest, she's just evolved and tried a different style. After all, it is boring to keep doing the same thing.<br />If you want purist jazz, buy Coltrane. If you want a nice change of pace, buy this album!
B0000019PA|5.0|i must say i agree with nearly every review posted. yes, this album is insanely wonderful. no, jeff magnum can't sing at all. yes, the rough production is raw and endearing. no, it does not sound like REM. yes, the guitar is catchy to the max and the melodies are gorgeous. no, neither are above grade-school level. this album will either make you cry with relief at finally finding the perfect peice of music, or cry in agony as you listen to silly lyrics and an out-of-tune voice. for those of us who do find something amazing in this album, it is not because we are &quot;indie cool&quot; or &quot;because pitchforkmedia said so,&quot; etc. well, i suppose for some it might be. that's not the point. for some people, highly produced and clean-sounding music with straightforward lyrics is the way to go. for others, raw emotion and abstract, personal details just hit the spot. this album scratches an itch in many a music-lover's ear. there is something cathartic in the simple melodies, something aching and true in the off-kilter tone, something strange, wonderful, and forgotten in the bizarre imagery. if this sounds like the kind of album you would pop into your cd player and hit repeat on, you're probably going to love it. if it doesn't, you probably already know.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Its funny when someone comes here to say this is the worst collection after a collection that doesnt exist - where is Madonnas Everybody album? Where was it released? Maybe inside of some dirty minds.<BR>I think American Life is one of the best albums released in the 00s. Sons like Love Profusion, Nothing Fails, Hollywood, Die Another Day, Easy Ride and Nobody Knows Me made me soooo happy when I bought the CD and still make me happy now.<BR>I LOVE IT!!!
B00009RAJI|5.0|First &quot;Rumours&quot; was re-mastered for cd...then came the 5.1 DVD audio version, which was simply amazing, not to mention the cool audio commentary option of the band members. Now, 2004, comes the special cd edition of &quot;Rumours&quot;, the landmark 1977 that spent 31 weeks at #1 on Billboard and has sold in excess of 30 million copies. It defined an era. So is it possible this new &quot;special edition&quot; makes it even better?? You bet! The disc is packaged in a neat little insert, with the jewel box inside. Inside the jewel box contains a cool booklet with nice pictures, a little bio of the group, and the lyrics. I laughed as the bio explained this album caused a generation of kids to think the word &quot;Rumors&quot; was spelled as &quot;Rumours.&quot; I am 37, and remember I used to think that as well! I often STILL mis-spell the word that way!(sometimes unintentionally) SO, yes, this band as always had an impact on my life,carrying it(or twirling it..he he he) on into Stevie Nicks' very prolific and excellent solo career.  The package contains two discs. Disc one is the re-mastered version of &quot;Rumours&quot; which sounds killer! This music is always going to be timeless, but the new mastering is spectacular! Disc two contains out-take versions of some of the &quot;Rumours&quot; cuts, some instrumental versions, and some demos of &quot;Never going back again,&quot; &quot;Planets of the universe&quot;(which wold be recorded over 25 years later for Nicks' top five selling 2001 solo album, &quot;Trouble in Shangri La&quot;, for which she recieved a Grammy nomination), a neat early demo of nicks and Buckingham doing harmony on &quot;Think about it&quot;(later recorded sans Buckingham on Nicks' debut #1 solo album &quot;Bella Donna&quot;) &quot;Butter cookie&quot;(an un-used Mcvie tune), two versions of &quot;Gold dust woman(one alternate version, one demo),&quot;Doesn't anything last&quot;(unused Buckingham tune), and a couple tracks listed as &quot;jam sessions&quot;.This collection doesn't alter any of the original recordings, only brings more sound out of it we might not hear from the orignal untouched analog recordings. And the second disc of extra goodies is enough to make any fan drool!....SO, yeah, this collection ROCKS! It is truly amazing and I will for sure next be buying the other two new &quot;Collector editions&quot; of Mac's &quot;Tusk&quot; album and the self titled 1975 album us &quot;Mac heads&quot; tend to refer to as the Mac's &quot;White album&quot;...There will NEVER be another band like Fleetwood Mac! And, also being a HUGE Stevie Nicks fan, I have to say, there will never be another Stevie Nicks! My Queen of rock!!!!;jam sessions&quot;.This collection doesn't alter any of the original recordings, only brings more sound out of it we might not hear from the orignal untouched analog recordings.

B00005JKN9|3.0|Not great, but good enough. With all the stars, the money, and especially the hype when this movie came out, one expected LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, DR. ZHIVAGO, and GOODFELLAS all rolled into one. Sadly, it's not even up to par to one of those films. It's passable as a minor epic -- but just passable. I expected a grand sweeping historical drama. Instead we get action up front, some historical perspectives through the middle (and frightenly close to being morphed into a chick flick), and finally culminating into the climactic riot and fight scene at the end. This last scene is the New York City draft riots of the American Civil War. The movie has no real buildup to these historical riots, but that's OK -- as they are a letdown here anyways. I believe the riots lasted about 4 days, and here they're condensed into one. They're used more as a backdrop for the fight scene between Amsterdam and Bill The Butcher. There is one bright spot: Daniel-Day Lewis and his characterization of Bill The Butcher saved this movie. He does an excellant acting job; and if he wasn't for him, this movie would have been a bust. I liked the movie, but it's not great. Ted Turner's GETTSYBURG was more mesmerizing.
B0001GL3K4|5.0|My mother and I enjoyed this film very much. It was hilarious, it was touching, it was happy, it was sad, and most of all it was worth watching more than once. The cast is amazing; needless to say, Alan Rickman was my main reason for wanting to see it, and as usual he does not disappoint. ^.~ Good music in this movie, too...some great songs are picked up during the course of the film, like &quot;Here with me&quot; by Dido. Overall I was impressed. The best funny scene was Rickman's character trying to buy a quick gift at the department store while Rowan Atkinson holds him up by adding trimming after trimming to the overdone present. The best sad moment was the incident with the signs: &quot;...to me you are perfect, and my wasted heart will love you forever...&quot; Oh, yeah, and that little boy was cute too.
B00008H2LB|2.0|Most of the songs on this album sounds kind of like Hybrid Theory, but with more rap and less metal. And is you listen to songs like Figure.09, Numb, Easier To Run, and Don't Stay; they sound exactly like One Step Closer, Pushing Me Away, Crawling, and Runaway with Chester singing depressed and sad. On Hybrid Theory, it was more screaming like &quot;SHUT UP WHEN I'M TALKING TO YOU&quot; and now it's something softer. Really weak. Big Downfall.
B00000DG1R|5.0|I love this album, it spans the decade full of hits for this super group. Don't listen to these losers, they sound jaded because their ex-girlfriend must have loved Duran Duran. Really this album has it all. Great slow songs and wonderful dance tunes. If you liked 80's new wave this is an album (CD) that you will not regret getting.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This CD is extremely good.  The voices of the singers soar and dip reaching levels of such musical bliss that it is undescriable.
0792838068|1.0|This movie is one of the most boring ones I have ever seen. Cage is drunk through the entire movie, and the woman he's with is a prostitute.  I normally love Nicholas Cage movies, but this one was an insult to his talent as an actor. Instead of renting this movie, slam your fingers in a door repeatedly.  That's free, and less painful than sitting through this stinker.
B0001Z53AQ|1.0|Another hip-hop album with the same tired ghetto-wannabe lyrics, boring backbeats and childlike stabs at humor. When will this misery end?
B00005JMFQ|1.0|In the past, writer Richard Curtis proved a brilliant writer of witty dialog. But he's not particularly good at constructing funny situations. And he's terrible at building a passable reality or an interesting fantasy. In this movie, which is under his direction as well as his pen, he also proves to be a poor acting coach, an all-thumbs editor, a tonedeaf musical director, and, overall, just, inept.<br />The movie is endlessly pointless. The characters are engaged in nothing serious or funny -- instead these talented people are acting through a suffocating hollywood-like porridge of boiled-down life-crisis moments. The off-target result just makes you wonder where these non-people came from. The movie is not sweet. It's not funny. It offers such badly drawn cartoons of life, that it achieves no mood at all, nothing of which I could approve or disapprove.
B000000W6R|5.0|other bands arn't fit to wipe [the floor]. a masterpiece of music. sure, no great hits but alot of awesme meaningful lyrics like from the song BLUE and Starla. my only complaint is the length of Starla, a great beginning but after a while the guitar wails and grind get annoying
B00006879E|5.0|The easy going sound of John Mayer with a little more substance.  Much bluesier and unlike anything I've purchased lately.  Every song sounds unique instead of the same thing over and over again 12 times.  A definite must have in your collection.
038572179X|1.0|McEwan wastes his abundant talent in deciding to play tricks with the reader in a plot so obvious that you know what will happen 20-30 pages before it does.  On a hot summer's day in 1935, at an upper middle-class English country house, the neglected thirteen year-old daughter, Briony, lodges false rape charges against the charwoman's son, a brilliant Cambridge graduate who has been raised with the family and financially supported by the patriarch.  The accused, Robbie, who has become the lover of the family's eldest daughter, Cecelia, is charged with raping (maybe) the vampish teenaged niece who is visiting.  The first section ends with Robbie being taken away in handcuffs, and the book immediately and inexplicably jumps ahead five years, to the disastrous evacuation of the British army at Dunkirk, where Robbie is serving.<br />Excuse me, but too many questions are left open.  Did the \\"victim\\" ever speak on her own behalf?  What actually happened (we are never told)?  Was the \\"victim\\" ever questioned by the police?  Was Robbie's accuser, Briony, ever questioned?  Any fool could have questioned them separately and torn the charges apart.  Did Robbie have a barrister?  Even the most incompetent attorney could have ripped holes in the ludicrous charges.  Was there a trial?  What was the testimony?  Did Cecelia, the eldest daughter and Robbie's lover, have ANYTHING to say in his defense?  Did she ever confront Briony with her suspicions?  Or did she mutely stand by and allow this travesty?  If so, why?  Are we supposed to believe that British class bigotry is the driving force?  Come on, this was 1935, not 1835, and a World War had been fought.  And what was the significance of the Dunkirk portion?  That was totally out of left field, and extraneous to the story.  The matriarch of the manor, perpetually sequestered in her bedchamber with migraines, is nothing more than a caricature from the Victorian era, a two-dimensional, milk-and-water prop.<br />This novel fails precisely because real people just do not behave in this way.  McEwan is too cute by half, and the ending is a total fraud, just too big a rabbit jumping out of the hat at the reader.  I do not recommend this book, even though the writing is superb.
B00005QK3W|5.0|Paul McCartney does Al Green and turns in his best performance since Tug of War. <br />Listen to Tiny Bubble and groove on the funk. Some people have said this tune sounds like Paul doing George Harrison. Given that George's best songs were full of soul that comparison may not be far off. <br />The band absolutely smokes on this CD. Full of motown grooves, even a bit of faux rap (Spinning on an Axis) this is easily McCartneys best CD since Tug of War. Pauls last three albums have seen him taking back his crown (Flowers In The Dirt - Flaming Pie - Run Devil Run, even Fireman and Rushes are pretty cool) Pauls voice and writing abilities have been rediscovering themselves. <br />Some of the vocalizations have Paul almost snarling out the lyrics or employing the little hiccups that Elvis made such good use of. I haven't heard Paul sound this good since... what? Oh Darling? Wanderlust? I Saw Her Standing There? Maybe there's no good comparison. Lets just say he sounds fantastic.<br />Listen to any of these three: Magic, Loving Flame, Back In The Sunshine Again and tell me that these arent' great songs. <br />The title track, Driving Rain, is a fun song with a solid rock feel and a good bounce to it. I can't help but sing everytime it comes on. This is a CD to play over and over.<br />A bit uneven? Maybe but thats what CD writers are for. Rip it and burn your favs. <br />Overall rating: if you're a Beatle or McCartney fan this CD is a must have.
B000002AZ8|5.0|Vitalogy is a solid entry, and is worth of praise. Most will know this album for yet another radio staple (remember no music videos) The haunting and brilliant &quot;Better Man&quot;. Also this album would mark PJ's periods where they break out of the main stream and push musical boundrys tracks like &quot;Bugs&quot;, &quot;Satan's Bed&quot; (where Vedder answers critics that clamed he is devil worshiper), and &quot;Whipping&quot;. Also Note worthy is &quot;Spin the black circle&quot; PJ's cry to not forget vynal records, and &quot;Tremor Christ&quot; the pro-choice themed anthem. Vitalogy pushes the boundries of Popular music and also estalblished Pearl Jam as a rock group not just a grunge group.
B000002UC5|5.0|This album was created at a time when, according to McCartney he could hardly force himself out of bed in the morning ( due to the split up of the Beatles ). <br />When he did get up it was to get a drink. <br />Even if that wasn't the case this album still stacks up as one of the great Beatle albums. Yes I'll include this under the Beatles canon as many of the songs, and the general mood of the album is still that of The Beatles.<br />I could never understand why this album was so savaged by the critics. McCartneys voice is great, the album is inventive and the songs, as always, shine through.  Maybe it was because at the time everyone was blaming Paul for the breakup.<br />My personal favorite on the album is Every Night. It took a while for the lyrics to sink in but:<br />Ev'ry night i just wanna go out,<BR>Get out of my head.<BR>Ev'ry day i don't wanna get up,<BR>Get out of my bed.<BR>Ev'ry night i want to play out<BR>And ev'ry day i wanna do-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh.<br />Perfectly describes how he was feeling and typically ends on an upbeat note telling us that he wants to do-do things. Simple and beautiful.<br />My second favorite is the song snippet &quot;The Lovely Linda&quot;. Say what you will about her, this songs clearly shows Pauls love in a playful sixties word picture. <br />Maybe I'm Amazed is great. The hit of the album although not as infectious or funloving as the above two. <br />Any of these three could easily have appeared on a Beatles album. Superior music.
B0000027RL|5.0|Okay everyone knows how Pearl Jam came to be, the members of Pearl Jam rooted in the seattle bands Green River, and Mother Love Bone, its lead singer (Eddie Vedder) who was with the seattle supergroup, Temple of the Dog. Ten was their debut release following the heels of the groundbreaking &quot;Nevermind&quot; by Nirvana. Everyone also knows it would be Ten that would launch Pearl Jam in the same orbit as Nirvana. but lets break down what Ten is, although it is Pearl Jam's most commercially sucessful album to date (due to the following albums absence of music videos, which i fully support), the sum is greater than its parts. Aside from Evenflow and Jeremy, we have the sonic rocker Deep which i find is sort of Eddie Vedders road map to stardom. The deep perplexic Garden, The gorgeous ballad Oceans, To the most underrated track in the Pearl Jam catalog, the moving Release. Which sometimes makes me still cry after all these years. Some say this is the album for all new Pearl Jam listners to get, I say get it because its the foundation. Even if your looking for something listen to or a group to get into, pick this one up and discover the dynasty's foundation.
B00006AW2O|4.0|With the first track, I was sure this was going to be a great album. Around and Around is so fun, rockin, and happy. And with the up coming songs, I was feeling The Stones. Especially when I got to Time Is On My Side and then the outstanding Its All Over NOw. Unlike most people, I didn't just get the cd to replace my record, I'm a new Stones fan. And I must say I like 1960's/Brian Jones Stones. With that said, side two, is a little worse. By Susie Q, I wasn't feeling them, but this was a good album!!!!!!!!
B0000028UK|5.0|Pearl Jam's second album Vs, would be the album that would shed the Seattle Scenes posers, no music videos, strictly an album made for PJ's fans not for the music fickalists. Most people will know Vs. for the radio staple &quot;Daughter&quot;. But this album is much more than that. &quot;Dissident&quot; fully displays Eddie Vedders song writing capablities (which is second to none) pitted with Mike McCreadys bluesy guitar makes a stellar track. This album also has the longest name in the PJ catalog &quot;Elderly Woman Behind The Counter In A Small Town&quot; which is a folksy didy about a man returning from the stratisfere to the small hometown from which he came from. Also, noteworthy is &quot;Leash&quot; which is PJ's rally cry to the establishment, and the socially concious &quot;Rats&quot; where Vedder compares the human race to rats and finds rats are superior. A Must have for those who must have meaning to their music
B00006BTCA|5.0|Anyone who's really listened to this album will know that these guys are miles away, musically, from what Joy Division were trying to do.<BR>This CD has been in my discman for about a month now and has only been taken out for the odd Flaming Lips/Wilco spin. I can listen to it over and over and over again and it just doesn't get stale. It almost sounds like a live CD, though they're not as good live (opening for the Datsuns?).<BR>If it hits you right, you'll get it. Otherwise you'll spend your life comparing them to other bands, like THAT'S original.
