B007SGM084|5.0|I was a bit intimidated about these books in the beginning because of the subject matter (BDSM) and intense sex scenes. As I read on though, those scenes explain quite a bit of who Christian is. The relationship between Ana and Christian is something neither of them experienced before. I fell in love with these characters in book #1 and couldn't wait to read the other two stories in the series. The story line is put together beautifully and is written in such a way, that I couldn't put them down. Throughout the series, I found myself laughing, crying, angry and embarrassed. You get very much attached to these characters and want to see them succeed in life and in their relationship. Ana and Christian grow so much throughout the series. They learn to love openly and keep each other happy. They learn to express their feelings and not to hide from each other. Christian realizes Ana is his savior and can not live without her. Ana realizes that Christian is her \\"happily ever after\\". He may not be a white knight but he is hers. The other characters in the books compliment Ana and Christian greatly. They tie the story together and bring it to life.<br /><br />I would recommend reading this series in order and with an open mind. The \\"play\\" scenes are hot and you may find that you are fanning yourself to no avail. I really enjoyed this series and can not wait to see what E.L. James has in store for her fans next. I'm crossing my fingers that she will continue the point of view with Christian from the back of book #3. I would love to see what he was thinking in some of the scenes in the book. All in all, this series was an excellent read.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is a good game and its fun to play .....But it does teach you a life lesson about taking care of things.

B007UWH3O2|2.0|So...<br />This album, or, collection of coma-inspired drivel, is a pure testament to the fact that Steven Wilson is trying to inbed himself into all forms of musical output, and place all of humanity into a nice long, somewhat disturbing slumber.  Everything he has touched in the past 4 years has been getting more and more drab, and somehow even more self-righteous.  Ackerfeldt, on the other hand, finds his new home here as he has pledged in many interviews how he never wants to growl again, and there is none of that here.  Don't get me wrong, I hate growling, But he too has turned from thoughtful, inspired music to an ill-begotten drug-hazed hippy revival with both Opeth's last album, and of course, whatever you want to call this \\"album\\".  It makes sense, since both artists have turned to the old ways of psychedelic rock where the beats fade in and out of comprehension(oh, there are almost no drums here at all, by the way)and the monotonous music drones on hypnotically only making sense if the listener is under the influance of a mind-altering substance.  This album will go down in history, as one of the most boring and unremarkable musical endeavors of all time.  Good job guys.  Way to set the bar.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so much fun I have a very hard time putting it down..... great challenges throughout .... a must have for everyone

B00000IQW3|5.0|Alex Rogan (Lance Guest) is a young man about to graduate from high school.  He dreams of going away to college but his student loan falls through and at best he has to go to the local city college.  He and his mom manage a small trailer park in the California foothills and his only diversions are his girlfriend Maggie (Catherine Mary Stewart) and playing the video game \\"Starfighter\\" outside of his home and local trailer park store.<br /><br />One night he shatters the top score of the game and the all of his friends at the trailer park gather around to watch him and congratulate him.  The machine goes crazy and tells him he is the record breaker. Later that evening a stranger pulls up in a futuristic car and convinces Alex to get into the vehicle.  Alex finds out that he has truly been recruited to fight Xur and the Kodan armada....<br /><br />My grandson came over last night and he wanted to watch a movie.  I pulled this one out of the archives and we enjoyed seeing it.  He saw it for the first time and for me it was the 10th time, probably.  This movie is one of the Sci-Fi classics and was one of the first movies to use computer generated imagery.  By today's CGI standard the movie is hokey but still a lot of fun to watch.<br /><br />If you have this movie you should get it out and watch it again and if not you should buy one and enjoy it with your kids!  It is worth watching as it is a good story and you will be amazed to see how far CGI has come since 1984.

B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Despite the fact that the book is for young adults, adults can read (and enjoy) it too.  It starts dark and gets darker, but it pays off. Despite having read a lot of books over my lifetime, I didn't quite see all of the turns.<br /><br />The premise is quite distressing - the idea that people would use children for spite against a group of people that were around almost 100 years ago, but it all does have a take home message. Try to stick with the books. I did find I had to take a breather after the first two books and it helped.<br /><br />I know this might sound a little stilted but I don't want to give anything away - you need to read it to find out!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|[[ASIN:B002MQYOFW The Hunger Games]]. WOW, heard all the hubbub of this series so finally read the trilogy.  Incredible story and admiration for Miss Everdeen.  I can't wait to see the movies!  I was hooked from the first paragraph and all three books consumed me and could not wait to get back to reading these in my free time.  Because of these books, archery will be coming back in full force as everyone wants to be as good as Katniss!  Superb, get the books, you will enjoy them!
B0077SGMXM|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!! My favorite android game by far. It's easy to pick up and play, but can also be challenging and addictive.  I eagerly am anticipating a sequel and other noodlecake releases.

0439023521|4.0|This is a really great book, one of the best I've ever read. The beginning is a little slow, but it gets really good. One part was a little stressful, but all in all, The Hunger Games is a really good book.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|These books are absolute guilty pleasure!  So many open avenues for Prequels and Sequels!  The characters are rich and complicated and even though the stories can be a little soap opera-esque, they are true page turners and very thrilling.  They provide quite an \\"education\\" as well!  Great Ladies Book Club selections.  MORE PLEASE!!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Outstanding continuation of an unfinished tale<br />The continuation (but hopefully not the conclusion) of [[ASIN:B0000AQS0F Firefly - The Complete Series]].<br />Serenity's story can stand on it's own, but it's so much more when you know everything behind it.<br />I highly recommend both movie and series for anyone and everyone. Both movie and series are from Joss Whedon who more recently brought The Avengers to life.<br />You won't be disappointed. Even the special features bring the story to life. Learn of the movement that brought a cancelled TV show back to life and to the big screen. Don't let the cancelled show turn you off to this. Firefly (the show) is ranked among IMDb's top 10 TV series of all time. [...]<br /><br />I own both the Blu-ray and DVD, but I'm not a quality expert or one to speak of one format being better than the other. For me, quality of either is just fine as I'm in for the story.<br />Keep an eye out for Firefly's the 10 year anniversary in September. [...]
B0052VUNHC|5.0|If you are looking for a story that will grab you from the beginning and will make you want to read it again as soon as you are finished reading it the first time, this is it!  I laughed, I cried and I'm glad it had a happy ending (sorry, hope I didn't give it away)!  I read this story in 2 days. I couldn't put it down. I can't wait until Jamie writes the next book to Travis and Abby's story.
B000002HPT|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums by Dream Theater, specifically for 2 reasons:  Doug From Kings X lends his talents, and Hells Kitchen<br /><br />I love excess, and I love pushing the envelope the way all the members of the band do.  But in this album there are moments of restraint, and simplicity that just take ones breath away.  Case(s) in point:<br /><br />The vocal interplay between Doug singing and Portnoy's infections, bottom ended funky groove add a dimension to their musc that has never been there before...namely, SOUL.  This song has got feeling in spades and it just makes you want to bounce.<br /><br />Hells Kitchen, has got to be one of the most beautifully crafted songs of all time.  I know it was originally supposed to be part of Peruvian Skies, but it's such a solidly orchestrated piece that I just had to stand on its own.  And, from the perspective of another Drummer who is always learning from Portnoy, there are moments in this song of absolute frentic restraint (yeah, I know they don't go together).  There is one fill that serves as a transition point, where under normal circumstances Mike would go all over the place on the kit, that he just lets his left hand stay home and ghost on the snare, while his right hand just simply goes down the kit...everytime I here that fill, my heart stops for just a moment and I feel the breath of God coming over me.<br /><br />Awesome boys, just awesome.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book! This is a must read series for all! I went out and saw the movie first, then decided to read the books. I just finished the third one. I highly recommend this series!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I started the hunger games and had to finish the series in 3 days.  It might have been written for young adults but there was a lot of depth in them.  Loved the first two books, MockingJay was a bit harder to read.  Watching Kat spiril downward after the second time in the areana was hard.  But the more I thought about it, the more realistic and heartfelt it seemed.  No matter how hard she fought to live she had not lived with the killing and cruelity of the games.  It is no wonder she had to hide for days at a time.  I missed Peeta, I think the author took the one thing that kept Kat grounded away, again probably more reality than I was prepared for but hard all the same.  The ending did feel a bit rushed after being so involved with the characters, but the read was worthwhile.
B006OB3K56|4.0|Although this movie does contain many sexual scenes, it has redeeming qualities of art. I recommend this film. The characters are ultimately pitied and the audience can have hope for them. The ending may be obscure to some people, but my interpretation is that the sexually addicted main character has repented and is on the road to recovery. Does art reflect life or does life reflect art?
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I generally give a book the benefit of the doubt for the first few chapters-it's a new read, so the author has to set up the story line. However, I was disappointed in the quality of the read. The book was filled with too much repetition and simple sentences; it made it difficult to concentrate on the plot.
B0059XTV4Y|4.0|This movie is recommended. The literary tools employed works rather well. The old King has many David Bowie qualities about him, especially in the way he holds his cigerette and loves to party, though with pretty women only.
B000KIPT30|4.0|Seems to work it can amplify the sound with minimal loss of quality  with one completely unexpected side affect. For some odd reason I am picking up a talk radio station. I don't even know how that is possible, but if the cords are not in tightly then I can hear some blowhard jabbering about  something to do with politics as well as what ever I am  listening to. If i press the wires in, and or turn them then it goes away, but still, how is that possible? It may be adapters I use, I don't know. But it does the job.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|it's a pretty good game. nice graphics and interesting game play. The drawback is the scrat game in which the prize is not what stated on the game

0385510454|1.0|May be an Interesting way to learn some Italian, if you're that desperate. Too much about the Italian language and Italy. Monotonous and slow! The ending was as much of a flop as the first 200 or 300 hundred pages of travelogue.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|The new golden age of television continues with this absolutely spectacular HBO series, based on the brilliant writing of George R.R. Martin.  You cannot help but be drawn into the bleak, yet richly colorful world of these fantasy/medieval style characters when the writing is this good and the actors so unforgettable.  The sets are often exquisitely beautiful, and the costumes dazzling.  At times the whole looks like pre-Raphaelite painting. ----  Having not read the books, I was now and then  confused as to who is who.  But I came to realize that the series would eventually give me all the information I needed to remain fully engaged and fully delighted.  --- There isn't a false note in the cast, nor a false line in the dialogue.  And one has the feeling, no matter how fantastic the kingdoms and their warring monarchs, that one is delving into our history and our evolution as a moral species.  Speculative fiction at its best --- which this most certainly is ---  is always about us and always about us now as well as \\"long ago.\\"  Games of Thrones is setting a whole new standard for daring, complexity, and sumptuous execution of the vision.  Highly recommended.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I like this book. I like it a lot. Is it written perfectly? No. But is it interesting? Engaging? And a nice twist on the Twilight book series? Yes. It sounds like Twlight people because it's derived from Twlight. I don't know why people can be so harsh when they write a review. Must be that bully behind the keyboard syndrome. The truth is, I can only get through book 1, I tried the others but for me, this was enough. However, they're touting this series as \\"mommy porn\\" and it's NOT. It's a story about a girl, who because of fate meets a rich good looking guy and falls in love with him despite his outlandish flaws. Why does this book merit 5 stars from me? Because E.L James has managed to create a human character and make him just as flawed as a supernatural one. I mean, Christian Grey might as well have told Ana that he was a vampire because breaking out those CRAZY contracts and showing her the red room in the way it was written in this novel was as equally jolting.  We are also drawn to this story because Christian Grey is inflicted with the sort of traits that appeal to a woman's nature. We want to be cherished, craved--we love it that his tastes are \\"singular\\" and he's a self proclaimed monogamous. Just like Edward, he lives to make Ana happy. THAT is his allure. Not the sex--the way he express his undying devotion to her through sex is a bonus!<br /><br />So, I was talking to one of my friends, who told me that she knows a girl who works for a Hollywood agent, who has her reading Erotica trying to find the next 50 Shades of Grey! Of course I barked, \\"They're STILL fools in Hollywood!\\" My friend read all three books and I asked her what made her keep reading--just to prove to her that it WASN'T the sex that makes this series so popular.  And she said NOTHING about the kinky sex or the number of times they have it. Heck, after a while it got monotonous to her, as it did to me in book 1! No... It was all about those traits I just mentioned. Love. Devotion. ExtremeAttraction towards one woman--the only woman for him.<br /><br />So, yeah, I hate reading cruel reviews, I really do. I really didn't want to write a review but after shaking my head at all that stuff I read, I had to write this.<br /><br />So listen to me, if you need to, want to, experience the kind of relationship we women crave--Then read this book. I promise you, Christian Grey will not disappoint you.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the games are ok, I'm enjoying the app so far, but the sushi game does not work at all whatsoever and I'm concerned about how people say they lost all they're game progress after each update.  if I find out this is true ill drop this to 2 if I'm in a boos mood, by editing a review, but for now its pretty good &#9834;
0756407125|4.0|I really loved this book, despite some of it's short comings.  The way you get to know some of the characters and disappear in this world is what makes the book.  However, sometimes it's a little frustrating to get stuck in so much detail in certain parts of the book, and yet other areas that could turn into a great section are glossed over.  For instance, you meet interesting characters (the librarian and the Mayor's physician) only to have them disappear.  He spends forever at the university, we finally get on the road and get some good adventures, only to have him back at the university in the end.  Sometimes I caught myself wishing that we get back to the main plot.  I was hoping for a big moment when the Mayor's wife is revealed as Kvothe's aunt, only to have that story be pushed off.  All we get out of that part is she has an ancient 3000 year old box nobody can open.  Really, if Kvothe is so brilliant how can he miss the fact that the Mayor's wife \\"looks familiar\\" and that she hate's the Rue because her sister ran off with them.  And the biggest frustration is that at the end of this huge book I know little more about the Chandrian, how he'll fight them, etc.  At this pace it will be five books before the climax.  Don't get me wrong, I still liked the book, but I just want the plot to move on instead of having a bunch of little side stories that often don't seem like they're going anywhere (the whole Feleurian visit seemed just a chance to make Kvothe turn from prude to ladies man so the author could write about his amorous encounters).<br /><br />Note:  Sorry for misspelling some names - I listened to the audiobook.
0451199871|1.0|Page after page of shallow character development would be tolerable if the characters weren't so utterly boring.<br /><br />Not a typical Christie yarn. Very little development of the mystery - except for page after page of people who aren't Miss Marple speculating. No puzzles to unravel. Just endless details about these boring characters until the end.
0553582038|4.0|I really don't understand why this book receives so much hate. It certainly doesn't have the pace of the first 3 but all in all I still had a great experience reading this. While there is slightly less action, A Feast for Crows still offers a ton that fans of the series will enjoy.<br /><br />Let me start out by saying I am a huge fan of this series. I didn't even know about it until \\"A Game of Thrones\\" aired on HBO but after watching the first season, I was hooked. I promptly read all the books in order, and now i'm just starting A Dance With Dragons. I will say that if you skip this book, you will be very upset. Like I said before, the pace is a bit slower but there is still quite a bit of pertinent information to receive. The last few chapters of this book were some of the best of the series up to this point.<br /><br />The POV characters that narrate this book are Jaime, Cersei, Sansa(Alayne), Brienne of Tarth, and Samuell Tarly. You also get special POV chapters from various important Ironborn and Dornish characters. Since this and the next book, A Dance With Dragons, take place at similar times the books are not sequels to each other but rather run parallel(with ADWD running a bit longer on the timeline). For this very reason you get to see a lot more of the characters that narrate the story, understand their feelings, and see how they go about everyday life. The way this book flows reminds me of Arya's chapters in the second book. You get a good grasp of the world around these characters with deeper descriptions and more historic lore from the world they live in. I personally enjoyed that part a bunch as it adds to the scope of the world and gives you a better idea of what it would be like to live in Westeros.<br /><br />Now, there were some flaws to this book. Most people didn't seem to like the Ironborn or Dornish chapters as they don't necessarily follow the main story line. They do cross somewhat in the end but the fact that Martin did this seemed to frustrate plenty of people. While I enjoyed the majority of these chapters, I will say that a few could have been left out. I found myself forcing my way through these select chapters in a way that I never did before. For this reason I give this book a 4 instead of a 5.<br /><br />Overall, this is still an excellent book in the series. It isn't as action packed as book 3, but the slower pace and fewer POV characters will give you a better grip on the world that Martin created. The Ironborn and Dornish chapters are(for the most part) very interesting and a change of pace from the main story. Some parts of the book slow down but it certainly ends with a bang that readers will not want to miss. My advice is don't listen to the negative reviews and read this one for yourself. I was also skeptical, but my love for the series pushed me to read it and i'm glad I did.
B005X5MXM0|4.0|This is probably the best I've ever heard Ian Hunter sing live, and the band sounds good. However, I think I'd rather just have a CD of this, due to the look of boredom and annoyance on Ronson's face throughout. Ronson looks distracted and downright pissed off through most of this. I'm not sure what was going on, but Ronson quite obviously wanted to be somewhere else! So, 4 stars instead of 5.
B0041D843M|5.0|The information in this book is very compelling and impossible to ignore.  I tell everyone about it.  Someone told me that this information changed his life!<br /><br />The health crisis in America is rampant and if everyone read this book, we could turn it around.  We are killing ourselves with food and our fast culture and the people who profit from it are food manufacturers and the drug companies that come up with a \\"solution\\" to the illnesses....with side effects that are worse than what they're trying to fix.<br /><br />The real solution is not easy, but it is achievable.  We need to take back our destiny.
B003J4MAAC|5.0|This production has some B-movie qualities, but I love the relationship between Tyne Daly's awkward but smart-and-determined rookie and the tough-but-fair Harry. Her desire to prove herself to him is played so well, including in the final bit of dialogue between them.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|From the very first word of Fifty Shades of Grey to the very last word of Fifty Shades Freed life as I knew it ceased to exist. Thank goodness I was on holidays.<br />I reluctantly stopped reading long enough to eat and shower, even sleep seemed a thing of the past.<br />I was utterly engrossed in the story of Christian and Ana, I come to know them so well that at the end of the series I grieved as though I had lost a love.<br />The erotically descriptive text had me squirming in my seat and yearning for a man like Mr Christian Grey.<br />I don't often blush but this book made me feel things on a whole different level.<br />Thank you E.L. James I look forward to reading more of your work.
B007Z9RAX4|4.0|An unusual approach to an action movie, deliberately understated. A lot of flashbacks and puzzle pieces. Even the score is relatively languorous, if hip. The film is fresh, compelling, and well-done in every way, a cleanly realized vision. It does not deserve the low-star ratings given by viewers who are put off by the quirkiness of the movie.

0307592731|5.0|A good friend asked me if I wanted to read Wild a book about a young woman who hiked the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) solo back in 1995. Wow, my friend had no idea how much I needed to read this book. It was incredibly timely and spoke to me on so many levels. It was hard to put down and difficult at times not to tear up along the way.<br /><br />In Wild, Cheryl Strayed covers a smattering of everything from the untimely death of her mother and break up of her family when she's only 22 to an absent father, infidelity, drugs, and divorce. She doesn't keep any thought hidden and gives the reader an opportunity to connect with and embrace the humanness of her raw pain.<br /><br />When Cheryl Strayed hits the PCT she's seemingly damaged from the inside out. However, through her journey, mostly alone but sometimes in the company of strangers, Cheryl Strayed grows a sense of her own power, grieves the loss of family, learns to trust in the kindness of others, and challenges herself to accept life just as it is.<br /><br />If you've ever enjoyed the book or seen the movie Into the Wild, then you'll want to check out Cheryl Strayed's story to see what happens when a woman goes into the wilderness to claim herself.<br /><br />Here is one of my favorite passages from Wild:<br /><br />It took me years to take my place among the ten thousand things again. To be the woman my mother raised. To remember how she said honey and picture her particular gaze. I would suffer. I would suffer. I would want things to be different than they were. The wanting was a wilderness and I had to find my own way out of the woods. It took me four years, seven months, and three days to do it. I didn't know where I was going until I got there.<br /><br />It was a place called the Bridge of the Gods.

B003WUYOQ6|5.0|I have read a few fad diet books in my time, and I can tell you that this isn't a fad.  I was blown away by the hard evidence Taubes presented, proving that we don't get fat because of a calorie equation but because of the refined carbs in our North American diet.  I have been trying to lose that last 10 lbs of pregnancy/breastfeeding fat for almost a year now, and in my first week of trying out Taubes' plan, I lost 3 pounds.  I don't feel as tired as I did before, nor do I feel like snacking as much.  It's truly amazing!  Eating bacon and losing fat at the same time feels good!
B007SGM084|5.0|I'm not a book reader at all. I saw the author talking on 20/20 about this book, so I looked it up on my touchpad.  Ordered the first book just for giggles.  I couldn't put the touchpad down.  The story draws you in and keeps you wanting more.  I have completely neglected my house  I ended up buying the 2nd book and read it in 2 days.  Tried to wait a couple week on the 3rd. But couldn't resist .  Now I'm done and want more.  This book could really be used for marriage counselling  I have been with my husband for 25 years and he will be reading these books soon. Love love love

B00633W614|5.0|To begin this review, please make sure you have read the first book in the series, Only Time Will Tell.  While this novel theoretically could stand on its own, you won't enjoy it near as much without having the background story of book one of the series!<br /><br />I had pre-ordered this several months ago and forgot about it until it appeared on my Kindle a few days ago - what a welcome surprise!  This book is classic Jeffrey Archer and, like just about everything else I have read by him, he has excellent dialogue and characters, good pacing, and shines as a master craftsman in his role as a storyteller.  He has the unique ability to get the reader into the head of not only his main characters but also the supporting cast.  I loved the continuation of the chronicles of the Clifton / Barrington family, and I sure hope there is another episode of the series!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Wow!  I am stunned almost speechless after reading this book.  I read every spare second I have; I'm talking a book every one to two days.  This book kept my adrenaline pumping and me guessing the next outcome constantly.  I'm rarely surprised with a book after reading so many; this book kept surprising me.  I have found a new favorite author.  I actually feel emotional, almost depressed having finished the book and there not being any more story to read of Travis and Pidge.  You have to read this book.  It is a gripping page turner.  You will not be disappointed.
B007HJ91HU|4.0|I really liked the origin, so when trying to bring back memories of the past it kind of seemed lacking.  I wish it would have been more of a remake of the original.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Definitely one of the better games on the market. It's fun and it's a great way to kill some time.
B002P79KAC|3.0|This show is a hit.  There are some references to sex that, if removed (or toned down) would not detract from the hilarity.  My oldest daughter watches, but I have to see the episode before my youngest is allowed to watch.  Overall a good, funny and entertaining show.

B003O86FMW|2.0|I thought that The Hunger Games was a decent book.  Clearly dumbed-down stuff, but ok as far as that goes.  The book doesn't try to be anything else.<br /><br />So it was with a certain degree of trepidation that I decided to read Catching Fire.  I chose the book partly because I was getting bored of other things and partly because I was able to check it out for free on my Kindle.  Plus, The Hunger Games movie is out and I figured what the heck... I haven't read anything else good lately, so what harm can it do to read this?<br /><br />Summary - Sappy teen girl drama.<br /><br />The love story is pathetic and typical.  16 (or is she 17?) year old girl loves two boys... and both boys love her... but she can only have one, etc, etc.  Gale, the childhood friend who she loves.  Peeta, the boy she also loves, but doesn't want to admit it because she is forced to love him... but is its real?  Or is it a charade?  Or do I really love him?  Or is it a charade?  Oh... what about my feelings for Gale?  I love him too!  Oh my - what will I do!<br /><br />Blah... Blah... Blah.  What's up with the obsession of teen girls caught between two men?  DP?<br /><br />You want this book in a nutshell - It reads like the journal of a teenager.  Here you go.  On page 125, Katniss thinks to herself, \\"...I love Gale...What do I mean when I say I love Gale?  I don't know.  I did kiss him last night, in a moment when my emotions were running so high.  But I'm sure he doesn't remember it.  Does he?  I hope not.  If he does, everything will just get more complicated and I really can't think about kissing when I've got a rebellion to incite.\\"<br /><br />Ohhhhhh the drama!  Whatever will she do!  The only way it could get more sappy would be if we suddenly found out that Gale was a dark and mysterious teen vampire... or maybe a werewolf.... Oh wait, that story is already taken...<br /><br />Love triangle drama aside, the book takes a 180 degree turn half way through in an attempt to re-harsh The Hunger Games again.  Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like the author herself is entirely vested in the idea -its more like she just needed to get through this stuff and get on to book three.<br /><br />I also found the final plot twist to be ridiculous.  The tributes had this elaborate plot to blow the force field and escape the games... but decided not to tell Katniss of the plan.  Uhhhhhh...ok.... So what if Katniss had killed off the people who were crucial to the plan?  What then?  Seeing as how the goal of everyone in the games is to kill each other, you would think that Katniss would actually need to know about the plan - especially considering how handy she is with bow.  Opps!  Shot and killed Volt!  What's that?  He was part of a big plan to escape the games?  Sorry - wish you would have told me about that before I shot him!<br /><br />Anyone giving this book 5 stars is a hack.  The Hunger Games is a \\"better\\" book - however you want to define it.  That isn't debatable.  If you love both books, you would still have to admit that The Hunger Games was \\"better\\".  If you hate both books, you would have to say that The Hunger Games at least not as bad as Catching Fire.  The bigger the fan, the more discerning you should be.  A true fan would make a distinction.  Do Star Wars fans rate all Star Wars movies 5 stars?  Heck no... it would be stupid and demonstrate that you have no idea what you are taking about.  Empire Strikes Back, 5 stars.  Return of the Jedi, probably 3 stars.  A New Hope, give it 5 if you credit it as the first movie... otherwise 4 because Empire Strikes Back was better.<br /><br />Same with this series.  5 stars doesn't reflect on the greatness of the book, it simply shows that you have no perspective.  No matter the context in which one rates this book, you would, at the very least, have to compare it against the series itself.  Therefore, no 5 star rating.  Period.<br /><br />\\"But Moondonkey... can't the books be equal?\\" you ask.<br /><br />No.They can't.  No.  They aren't.  Now go back to watching iCarly and Victorious and stop with the nonsense.<br /><br />If memory serves, I gave The Hunger Games 4 stars.  So why 2 for Catching Fire?  Because 3 would be an \\"average\\" book in general.  3 isn't necessarily bad... it is solid... middle of the road... average.  Is Catching Fire that?  No.They can't.  No.  They aren't.  Now go back to watching iCarly and Victorious and stop with the nonsense.<br /><br />If memory serves, I gave The Hunger Games 4 stars.  So why 2 for Catching Fire?  Because 3 would be an \\"average\\" book in general.  3 isn't necessarily bad... it is solid... middle of the road... average.  Is Catching Fire that?  No.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Keeps me busy. Not bad. A little addictive. Want to keep trying to open new levels. Some games are fun; others are hard.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|My 2 star review is as much for the whole series as this final book.  The Hunger Games started out well enough, but Catching Fire was nothing more than a bridge novel and by the third book Katpiss has devolved into an unlikeable wench.  Given that The Hunger Games movie was so successful, I have no idea how they can follow it up with anything - unless the plot and characters are revised, the next films won't live up to the hype.  Well... I suppose that the subjective teen girl audience will no doubt applaud one way or another.<br /><br />To start off, the leaders of District 13 want to make Katniss into a symbol of the revolution - a propaganda tool.  In order to get the message out, they dress her up, put her on stage, and attempt to shoot some footage of her saying some lines to inspire the troops.  She basically lays an egg and they call off the production.<br /><br />Ok... so they are only doing one take?  They aren't going to give it another try?<br /><br />So what do they decide to do after ONE try at having her say some lines on camera?  The leaders of District 13 and Haymitch decide that they would get better footage if they put her in combat situations.  Uhhhhhhhh....ok.<br /><br />Meanwhile, President Snow has nothing better to do with his time than concern himself with a reality show contestant.  Katniss is basically just like a winner of Survivor, yet the President makes it a top priority to make her life miserable - torturing Peeta and such.  Really?  There is a war going on and Snow has nothing better to so than to focus his efforts on a propaganda tool for the resistance?  Snow bombs District 13 and goes out of his way to leave flowers as a message for Katniss?  Give me a break.<br /><br />Frankly, I found Katniss to be absolutely self-centered and annoying.  Everything is about her.  Her clothes... her hair... her potential boyfriends... her family... Heck, even her desire to rescue Peeta is really about her.  Is Katniss happy when Fennick is reunited with his girl?  No... she is jealous.<br /><br />Seriously now... think about this... does Katniss really care about the resistance and the war?  OR, does she really just care about herself?  What is her motivation?  Is her motivation to free the districts from tyranny, or is it to save herself and her friends?  Is she a selfless hero willing to sacrifice herself for the cause, or is she merely doing what she has to until she comes up with more options?  Is she leading the charge, or is she just being swept along by the tide?  Is she interested in the welfare of the people, or just her obsession with killing Snow herself?<br /><br />For example, think about her reaction to Peeta's torture at the hands of Snow.  On page 179, Katniss thinks, \\"I cover my face with my arms because this isn't happening.  It isn't possible.  For someone to make Peeta forget that he loves me... no one could do that.\\"<br /><br />Dude!  Are you kidding me?  The guy just went through weeks or torture and your biggest concern is that he might not love you anymore?  It is Prim, not Katniss, that expresses some concern over Peeta and his state.  Katniss, like usual, just focuses on her own feelings.  How could Peeta stop loving me?  I'm sooooo special.<br /><br />Well - apparently Peeta isn't that big of a deal, because within a few days Katniss is making out with Gale again.  On page 196, Katniss kisses Gale and thinks, \\"despite what I feel for Peeta, this is when I accept deep down that he'll never come back to me.  Or I'll never go back to him.\\"<br /><br />Wow.  I guess that's all it takes huh?  Gale sticks his tongue down her throat and Peeta is washed up.  But that's Katniss for you - Peeta isn't interested anymore, so too bad for him.  After all, it is all about who loves Katniss... this rebellion stuff just gets in the way.<br /><br />Perhaps you think I'm just being negative and unrealistic.  Not so - other characters in the book point out what a train wreck Katniss is.  Johanna tellsKatniss she is \\"hard to swallow\\" with all of the \\"tacky romantic drama.\\"<br /><br />Katniss even refers to herself as violent, distrustful, and manipulative.<br /><br />Another example on page 266.  Haymitch calls Katniss out for how poorly she is treating Peeta, \\"If you'd been taken by the Capitol, and hijacked, and then tried to kill Peeta, is this the way he would be treating you?\\"  Katniss has to admit to herself that it is not.  \\"He would be trying to get me back at any cost.  Not shutting me out, abandoning me, greeting me with hostility at every turn.\\"<br /><br />And why does Katpiss act like this?  Because she is a self-centered B that's why.  An entirely unlikeable character.<br /><br />More?  Page 327 - Peeta and Gale are discussing who Katniss will choose and Gale says, \\"Katniss will pick whoever she thinks she can't survive without.\\"  This statement disturbs Katniss, who thinks \\"am I really that cold and calculating?\\"  She gets upset because Gale's comment implies no passion or feeling - rather that Katniss is simply conducting an unfeeling assessment.<br /><br />Katniss aside, the \\"end game\\" of the book gets really stupid when Katniss takes command of a group of soldiers and decides to invade the Capitol herself in order to assassinate Snow.  Wow... I mean heck, why wouldn't you invade the Capitol by yourself?  Gee - if it was that easy why didn't anyone do it before?  Oh wait... sorry... I'm not supposed to be thinking about that...<br /><br />Anyway, as Katniss and her dwindling team progress into the Capitol, so do the rest of the rebel forces.  Where did they come from?  Who knows.  Was there any plan to invade the Capitol at this time?  Who knows.  How is the Capitol defended?  Who knows.  Why did the Capitol basically plant \\"pod\\" bombs all over its own streets?  Who knows.  Where did they get squads of mutants to track people down?  Who knows.  Does the reader really have any idea what is going on other than what is in the head of Katniss?  No.  Like I said in the beginning, this book reads like a personal journal of her emotional problems.<br /><br />Sometimes when reading a book, you can sense when the wheels fall off the cart and the author is looking for a way to just get it over.  That's how I felt reading the last few chapters of Mockingjay.  A senseless progression of absurdity leading up to the conclusion.
1455869880|5.0|This is a library audio CD version of the book. I think had I not listened to the book, narrated by Kate Rudd, I would have given up early. The characters are pretentious, unreal, and unlikable. But I loved Kate's voice and her ability to bring life into the story. It is amazing how soon I was pulled in, in spite of myself, and cared deeply for the characters.<br /><br />As has been mentioned in previous reviews, the book description, and my tags, this is a book about teens who have cancer. As if being a teen isn't difficult enough to go through, add to it, dying. So, yes, this is a bring your Kleenex book. But it is bittersweet and you may find yourself laughing at the antics of the characters and their lighthearted take on the serious situations they find themselves in.<br /><br />Would all teens with cancer like this book? Would all young adults? I don't know. I am 62 and I loved it! Not the subject matter. I lost my mother to cancer. It isn't pretty. But we all deal with life and what it hands us differently. But for Hazel, Augustus and Isaac, this is their lives and how they choose to live and die. Philosophies of life and love are examined and either embraced or rejected and sometimes both.<br /><br />I may eventually buy the Audible version and the Kindle version as I feel there is a lot to learn about writing within these pages. I would like to see how I'll imagine the voices/personalities without Kate Rudd's voice.<br /><br />What is special about this version is the interview with John Green at the end of the book. He talks about the writing process attached to this book. He, also, said that he made an audio version with his own voice. That would be fun to see how he would interpret his own words.<br /><br />I think it is a great read, but I wouldn't go so far as to make it a mandatory book for high-schoolers. In fact, I would caution the reader to choose a time in their lives when they feel stable to then savor this book.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|one of the best concerts of cream, who knows music buy the video,<br /><br />This video is another for music collectors
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this is a great game and is overwhelming. but gamloft needs to make a second one to get more likes and more fun for gamers
B007Z9RAX4|4.0|I know this isn't the best action movie ever made but I cannot believe some of the low ratings.  Like Taken, the story is second to the action.  The story is good enough and interesting enough to keep you interested but the action is the real story.  Gina does a great job!!!  She doesn't come across as someone acting like a tough \\"guy\\".  She comes across as tough and real.  I highly recommend this movie.
0345803485|5.0|Wow, I was so exited to get this book.when the package came I opened the box and gave it to my dog to chew on it.And I can tell you know everyone in my family enjoyed the pages of this book.Pg. 1-25 was used as for my dog to pee on and Pg.25-67 where used for my cat to play with.Me and my friend made origami with pages 67-100, and it was really fun.Pg.100-198 \\"accidentally\\" went in the shredder, and then I recycled them so I could save trees which the author did not do, she can thank me later :).And pages 198-256 made perfect book Frisbee on a sunny afternoon in the park.I went out camping a few weeks after I got the book, and pages 256-300 made perfect toilet paper, when i ran out of it. And pages 300-400 made wonderful fire starters when covered in paraffin wax.My friend and I needed pages 300-426 to add weight for a tofu press.And pages 426-467 served quite well as a monitor riser for my mom's LCD screen.While pg.467-520 I used make a pretty cool paper mache project.And the last 8 pages where so \\"Omg\\" that i had to \\"bite my lip\\" every firkin second.I used them as a fan on the beach as I saw hot guys who acutely treated you like a a true woman and not like a piece of trash.But anyway between picking a random phrase out of it that makes you howl with laughter and taking the book and using the books for better purpose i really enjoyed it.Sadly only the covers are left of the book now, which I will be sending to the author with a message saying \\"The picture of the book, is still a batter love story then Fifty Shades of Grey.\\"
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Review from MetalArcade.net<br /><br />\\"The best Hulk movie yet.\\" That's what a lot of people are saying about The Avengers, and while that is absolutely true, it's much more than that. It's an incredibly fun film, overflowing with action and yet still making time for real character development, and even some truly great comedy. I tip my metaphorical hat to Joss Whedon, who has pulled off one of the most exciting and engaging superhero movies I've ever seen.<br /><br />Whedon is a certifiable geek genius, and his passion shines through in every frame of this film. Having helmed Buffy and Firefly, he's become very adept at bringing a team together and giving them some heart. There's no better example than in the fact that The Hulk was one of my favorite characters in this movie, when I've previously only seen him as boring and one-dimensional. I have to give credit to Mark Ruffalo as well, for making this character very watchable rather than groan-inducing.<br /><br />If you've seen any Marvel film in the past few years, you know full well that Sam Jackson's Nick Fury has been trying to wrangle together a super group of superheroes together for his Avengers Initiative. The film has a very basic premise- Thor's Loki (Tom Hiddleston) has attacked the Earth with an alien army, and the only way to stop him is to get the band onstage - that would be The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Captain America (Chris Evans), Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner).<br /><br />That's a lot of characters to balance, and I went into The Avengers fully expecting the film to be cluttered, confusing and disjointed. It's a small miracle that the film is not only easy to follow, but incredibly fun to watch. The dialogue between the team (especially when they first meet) is excellent and often hilarious, and never feels forced. Nobody feels shoehorned in, and there are so many epic action sequences that I almost felt worn out by the end of the film's runtime. The theater I saw it in was packed to the brim (much like the film itself), and although I had to crane my neck the entire time, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. It almost feels like a lucid dream, speaking as a comic fan, because even though the film has been hyped for years, it's difficult to comprehend the awesomeness of seeing all these great characters (and actors) on the same screen. It's a bit cliche, but it is the closest thing I've yet seen to a comic book come to life, and it's every bit as awesome as I hoped. It's just an exceedingly fun movie, which is very rare these days.<br /><br />Every character is at their best in this film. Captain America is as patriotic and no-nonsense as ever, and Iron Man's vicious wit is always hilarious and never overbearing. Ruffalo manages to imbue Bruce Banner with a few new layers of heart, and lends him a distinct personality that was sorely lacking from Hulk's previous film entries. We also learn what makes Black Widow tick, and she is genuinely interesting this time around, rather than just a ridiculously hot female in tight leather. Which I still would have been ok with, but at least women won't have any reason to complain about her- and she kicks a lot of ass in this movie.<br /><br />It's not spoiling anything (it's in every commercial) to tell you that there are a few battles among the heroes in this movie. I won't give away who fights who, but rest assured that these battles are even cooler than they were in the comics, and executed very well. They're also not just done for the sake of awesome fight scenes, as it realistically shows off the wildly differing personalities of the team, which definitely don't quite gel together at first.<br /><br />It's not necessary to watch all of the heroes' previous Marvel films to understand The Avengers, but it definitely gives the characters and their interactions more depth. I would say that Thor is the only must-see film before TheAvengers, as the films' villains are the same person, and his motivations, and the brother's personalities  become much clearer upon viewing that film. The members of the S.H.I.E.L.D. team, notably Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders), Nick Fury (Sam Jackson), and Agent Coulson (Clarke Gregg) all get much less screen time than the main cast, which is to be expected, but they all are handled well, with Coulson and Fury feeling much more fleshed out after viewing this film.<br /><br />Overall, The Avengers can be seen as nothing short of a huge accomplishment. Everyone in the cast gives their best performances thus far, and bounce off of each other perfectly. Joss Whedon infuses every scene with heart and excitement, and you'll be on the edge of your seat for the entire film. I can only hope that The Dark Knight Rises and The Amazing Spider-Man match my expectations as well as The Avengers has.Avengers, as the films' villains are the same person, and his motivations, and the brother's personalities  become much clearer upon viewing that film.

0345803485|2.0|This series is awful.  The characters are one-dimensional.  The sex scenes are not great.  But to be fair to the author, I have read all three books.  The author understands the power of a \\"cliff-hanger\\".  I had to finish the books so that I could see what happened to the characters.
1451648537|5.0|I give this book 10 stars out of 5.  Walter Isaacson hit a home run with this book.  A biography can sometimes seem daunting simply because of the length, and this one's 600 pages.  But I couldn't wait to read every chance I got.  Having been an Apple fan since the Macintosh II, it's not a stretch to say that I've always loved their products and admired Steve Jobs for his vision, style, and ambition to make good devices.  What's fascinating is to read how it all happened from Steve's teenage years to present.<br /><br />Steve Jobs is a genius, simply put.  If he had only done one of his accomplishments, he'd still be great.  The fact that he did so many things well will blow you away when you read about how he made things happen.  I loved every detail of the book from his business to Pixar to his personal relationships, and his family.  Walter Isaacson wrote about the greatest person of the last century, and he couldn't have written it better.  Really wonderful book.

B005S9EJZA|3.0|If you like every chick flick, you want to see this one. It has everything you want. Hot guy with Hot girl that fall in love with each other. Love songs. Touching scenes. The girl that missing her pass away brother and divorced with a child. A 3 way love triangle between our 2 love birds and the dad of the kid. This gives the audience somewhat a villain in the movie.  Now the plot all setup and ready to go.<br /><br />I thought Zac Efron did a great job when he played the silent strong type for his character towards the girl. But, I didn't believe him when he was in Iraq and playing a Marine. He didn't make me believe in his and I didn't really care for it. The girl, Taylor Schilling, wasn't that great of an actress. She just did a okay job. The son, Riley Thomas Stewart, did a great job with his acting and scenes. Jay R. Ferguson, did an okay job playing a controlling father/Ex-husband.<br /><br />I thought this movie was all right. There were good scenes with Efron's character and Stewart's character bonding together. There was great scenes with Efron's character and the grandmother bonding together. This all leaded to Efron's character becoming more of a family member and letting Schilling's character want to love him even more. Hack there were even scenes where Efron's character made him the better man than Ferguson's character.<br /><br />What I didn't like was the ending. They just had to do that to Fergusion's character to make the whole movie had a happy ending. I didn't like that and it's way over cheesy.
B001IBIHQ4|3.0|Good but not nearly as good as band of brothers; i know that's not exactly fair, but i just thought band of brothers was much stronger, a better drama.  The look and feel of the show though is excellent.<br /><br />As far as the delivery of the product though, the experience was excellent - delivered quickly, in stated condition.  One minor gripe is that one of the disc holding hub things is cracked and doesn't hold its DVD well, but it's not a big deal.
0345803485|4.0|I put off reading this book for a couple months because of the subject, just not into it. However, this book had me from page one. LOVED IT! Very entertaining, compelling story. Even as farfetched as the \\"love\\" scenes seemed, it did leave you feeling envious that she was experiencing that and not you!<br /> If someone buys this book expecting literary genius they will be disappointed, it is an romantic entertainment book that has a splash of british wordery and lots and lots of seemingly fantastic sex.<br /><br />Read it for what it's worth, wishing YOU were Ana or that you knew a man as talented Christian Grey- and don't expect Jane Austen.<br /><br />I would HIGHLY recommend this to ALL my girlfriends!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I haven't read all of the trilogy yet, but the first book is excellent and I'm looking forward to continuing with the rest.
B007DJUO8O|5.0|Let me start off by saying that this is not an Opeth or Porcupine Tree album. It is about as far from prog-metal as you can get actually. Much closer to psych-folk. I was looking forward to this project for quite a while and I was not dissapointed. If your first listen is with an open mind then I think you will love it. If your expectation is for PT or Opeth record then I can't really help you. (I do love both of those bands as well) The material definitely sounds like it probably was written by Mikael on guitar with Steven contributing most of the vocals. (Even though they do switch off many times...the chord progressions definitely sound like Mikael's.) It is a very dark record with some beautiful melodies and great singing. I just listened to the vinyl copy last night with the rain pouring down outside. Somehow it seemed very appropriate. This record defies categorization. Appreciate it for what it is and enjoy the dark journey...

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I had seen the movie first and just had to get the books. I am still on the first book and can't wait to get to the rest of the books and hope they make movies of the rest of the books soon!
B004HXIZVC|5.0|this app works fine. I noticed other people give this a lower rating due to the record button even though the kindle fire has no mic. honestly, it really doesn't get in the way, and its not like I was even gonna record anything from a mobile device anyway. this app is a great extension of the site (far better than the soundcloud mobile site) and I like it a lot. very easy to use.

0307951529|5.0|Chris sent me an advanced copy of the book a couple of weeks before the official release date for free and I couldn't be more happy about it. (I'm on his mailing list.) The book was everything I hoped it'd be! Other than the free book I'm not receiving any secret paychecks or any other weird incentives for writing a good great. The book is simply really great.<br /><br />This book already has plenty of 5 star reviews - and rightly so! The best part about The $100 Startup is the actionable information that it provides. It focuses on the main part of starting and running a business - MAKING MONEY! Not all of the silly fluff like \\"start a Twitter account!\\" or \\"start a blog!\\" Sure, these things can help, and Chris makes this clear, but a main point of the book is that you really have to think about what your business is about and what value it provides customers. I really appreciated this part of it.<br /><br />I emailed Chris when I was having some trouble with my idea and he reemphasized the point - focus on providing real value to your potential customers and all good things will follow.<br /><br />If you want more time and escape the rat race pick up this book. Granted, I'm not quite the digital nomad that I'd like to be yet but I'm closer than ever thanks to the direct concentrated info of this book. Don't hesitate! Get a copy and maybe one for a friend!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|If you like Myst-type games you'll like this. I had to use the hints more than I wanted to, mostly because I couldn't remember which screen had what things on it.  The map is large.  I agree it would have helped if I could have moved around by touching it. But overall a fun game and worth the purchase. Nice job and I'll be looking for more from this developer.

B0072PUC7W|1.0|Time machine to 1995 trance anyone?  Where do I start... well CD1 was alright, but nothing too special; pretty forgetable really.  Around track 12-end we begin the time warp that REALLY continues on CD2.  Seriously this is the most formulaic trance one could possibly create.  One could write a computer program to spit out tracks like this.  Here's how it goes (see if this sounds familiar to you):<br /><br />1) track starts off bumpin' following a played out, static 8 count rhythem of A-C-B-D pitch (ie high sounds 2 count, low 2 count, almost as high as before 2 count, lil lower than the low 2 count) ...or quickly builds to this point<br />2) suddenly the bass/beat/everything completely stops ~1:30 to 2:00 into the song<br />3) 2-3 seconds of silence<br />4) enter either: a) operatic/cheesy female vocal; b) high synth you've heard 1000 times before<br />5) surprise surprise! track starts to slowly layer back in the mid beat and build up volume/\\"wall of sound\\"<br />6) a COMPLETELY played out very fast dut-dut-dut-dut-dut beat or static note signaling the big climax!<br />7) the bass beat finally re-enters and the song is bumpin' as before (by now we're about 3:00-4:00 into the track)<br />8) static 8 count of A-C-B-D follows for 1 minute<br />9) bass drops out again, but not the mid beat so as to create a slight dip in the song once again, yet still dancable and rocking, just not as much as before<br />10) full bass quickly returns within 30 seconds<br />11) static 8 count once again follows for another minute or 2<br />12) next track mixes in abruptly, but is OK because it's the same bass tempo and same sound<br />13) rinse and repeat<br /><br />Seriously!  Play CD2 tracks 9, 10, 11 right now and tell me you haven't heard this 1,000,000 times before!  YOU CAN'T DENY THIS IT IS FACT!!!  I've been listening to trance/techno/EDM/house/progressive/D&B/dubstep/etc. since the early 1990's and as I listened to this I seriously was asking myself, \\"Is this supposed to be the best of trance?  Maybe I just don't like trance anymore?  All these songs sound the exact same and on top of that, sound the exact same as tracks that came out 15 years ago.  I've been listening to a lot more progressive/house/dubstep lately..... so MAYBE IT'S ME???\\"<br /><br />NO!  It's not me!  I love good trance and this is garbage!  Even the latest Anjunabeats was weak and forgettable.  DJs/producers keep recycling the same sounds vs innovating.<br /><br />ASOT = the new Ministry of Soundbest of trance?

0061122416|5.0|This is a book for dreamers<br />  If you have a dream that makes you passionate, this book just fits you. If you have already bred a dream in your heart but you don't know how to pursue it, you can find the answer in this book. If there is no dream in your heart, this book is what you need most. This book is a book about Personal Legend and Language of World. What's the name of this thrilling book? Well, its name is The Alchemist.<br />  Before reading The Alchemist, I wasn't a fan of fiction. After experiencing with Santiago, the main character in the book in his way to Personal Legend. I abruptly found I had been a huge of fan of fiction! When I was reading this book, it seemed that I was one of the sheep who could feel his heart or a customer in the crystal merchant's shop where Santiago was working.  As comparing with story of superhero like Spider Man, I prefer the story in this book because this is a story that everyone can touch and feel the pulse inside. Everyone can make connection with Santiago rather admiring the Superheroes who are further to us than the distance between Sun and Earth. Apparently, We can dig more treasure out from Santiago's story. Realizing and achieving one's Personal Legend is the most conspicuous diamond in the treasure.<br />  This is a book that is nearly impossible to put down. Just like the comment of this book from London Times: \\" [Coelho's] books have had a life-enchanting effect on millions of people\\", everyone can find inspiration from this spectacular book----The Alchemist. I recommend it highly.

1609419693|5.0|I listened to this as an audio book, so my experience may be different, and even better, than those who read the physical book!<br /><br />Tina Fey read the audio version and not only was it great to hear her as the author read it (as it usually is wonderful to hear any author read their work) but she added little lines just for the audio version addressing the \\"listeners\\". Hilarious.<br /><br />This book is hilarious. I'll admit that I don't watch SNL and really only knew Tina Fey from her Sarah Palin impersonations, but this book was recommended by a friend so I tried it. You will not be disappointed. Yes, she's a bit crass and talks with blunt, SNL type humor, so as long as you're not easily offended by that kind of humor/language, you will enjoy this.<br /><br />She talks a bit about growing up, and then about SNL and 30 Rock. All hilarious. Just get it and listen to it. You will laugh out loud in your car - alone. :)
B0063GORYU|5.0|great game.  easy to use on kindle fire.  no issues here.  I would truly recommend this game whole heartedly. love it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Let me support my review by giving some background on this series, I was not especially thrilled with book one, but it wasn't horrible, so I went ahead and read book two and the characters evolved and a love story was formed and I really felt the need to see where they took me on thier journey.  So now I have read book three, which was my favorite out of all of them, it isn't very often when the writer gets better with each book and the story gets better.  Book one was about 90% sex and 10% love story, book two was 50% sex and 50% love story and by book three we are at 10% sex and 90% love story which is about typical for a relationship.  This was a fullfilling journey of money, love, and a young girl where her virginity is actually respected and cherished and that isn't seen every day.  I enjoyed this last book and all of it's turns and twists and I enjoyed watching these character grow and mature with each page right before my eyes.  I would highly recommend this series and book three is the icing on the cake.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I have had this game for about a week now and unman its amazing I'm not a big video gamer or any thing but this one is fun has heck. I play for hours :)
0345803485|5.0|I loved all 3 books, the first one leaves you hanging and i could not wait for the second one.. It is a great love story, it is a fantasy, it should be read as one, cant compare it to real life and expect this billionaire to pop into your life. I fell in love with the characters with Christian and Ana,and the way they interact with each other and how they get to learn and grow into a perfect relationship. In the first book the sex sex scenes might come as a shock and very erotic but this book grows in you, and it is not about the sex anymore but a great love story. I hope she writes a lot more books, i cant say that the book was very well written, you can expect that from a new writer, but the essence of great story is there. I really, really enjoyed it.
B00028HBKM|5.0|It was great n i would def purchase from this seller again. Went above and beyond to make my purchase enjoyable
B007V5CF5K|5.0|This game is a great find, pun not intended. It's basically a game where you work through a story by finding objects hidden in the different areas. What I really enjoyed was the quality of the artwork in each scene and the careful thought evident in just about everything. it is definitely worth the 99 cents.

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|The first thing that came to my mind the moment I began reading The Help by Kathryn Stockett was her vernacular. Kathryn Stockett is what you will term 'white', for lack of a better word. But it's amazing how she manages to fit into the day-to-day vernacular of a 'colored' woman. Her language is free-flowing, easy and natural, and no where in the book does it feel like she is making an effort or any of it is made up. Full points to her for that.<br /><br /> The story is told from the point of view of three main female characters - Aibileen, the motherly, loving, intelligent colored maid, who works as a nanny and maid; Minnie, who is a sassy, sharp-tongued maid, but clearly one of the best cooks the white ladies have ever had; Miss Skeeter, a young white female who has recently returned from college, only to find that her beloved Constantine, the colored maid who raised her and took on the figure of a real mother for her, has suddenly disappeared, and who now has the passion to share her thoughts on what she feels is needed today to make this world a better place, and who clearly does not believe in racial discrimination and wants to do something to bring an end to it.<br /><br /> The Help is set in the 70s, in Jackson, Mississippi, a time when apartheid was rampant, especially in the areas mentioned in the book, and the discrimination between colored and white people was openly practised.<br /><br />The story:<br /> Aibileen is a mother-figure, a colored woman who has spent her life, from the time she was a pre-teen, in the house of 'white' people raising their babies - 17 to be precise. And for each of the babies she has raised, she has a special place in her heart. Some have turned out to be just the way she hoped, the babies she once held in her arms have turned out to be amazing as human beings, while a few have learnt the ways of their parents and grown up to discriminate the very race that brought them up with so much love and care. Aibileen has recently losta grown-up son, and she confesses that something inside her has now changed. Her son, educated and intelligent, was writing a book on being a black in America in the 70s, but being colored meant he could not get a decent job, and he was forced to work as a cargo man, hauling heavy stuff. It was on one such night that he got crushed and his white employer put him in a truck and once outside the colored hospital, rolled off his body and drove off. Aibileen's son died, taking away something from his mamma's life forever. As Aibileen begins her new job looking after Mae Mobley, the white baby of Miss Elizabeth Leefolt, we are taken into the home of the whites, to see the discrimination that is seeped in society and its culture.<br /><br /> The same maid who is deemed fit to raise a white infant and take care of her all needs is not seen fit to use a bathroom that white guests may use. A colored maid cannot sit at the same table to eat, she is not allowed to speak to a white person unless a white person talks to her, and even while handing out a coffee cup, a colored maid is expected to first place the cup on the table, so that the white person will not come into contact with the colored skin, even by accident.<br /><br /> Minnie is Aibileen's best friend, despite their age gap. A tough, colored woman, raising her brood of kids, living with a husband who is drunk and beats her up regularly, the pressures of providing for her children falls mainly on her. This is not easy, especially for Minnie, as she is notorious for having a sharp-tongue and a sassy attitude, one that lands her in trouble often. She does not hide her contempt for the way the whites treat the coloreds, and she is not afraid to speak her mind, many times at the cost of her job even.<br /><br /> Skeeter is a white who is now feeling alien in her own white world. She has recently returned to her family's plantation and mansion after completing college. While her friends busy themselves with clothes, shoes,bridge parties and gossip, all the while mistreating or ignoring the colored people around them, Skeeter finds it increasingly difficult to abide by these so-called 'white' rules of etiquette. She is appalled at the way the colored are being humiliated, and she finds many loopholes in a society that otherwise calls itself 'perfect' and 'classy.' Determined to become a journalist, Skeeter lands herself a job as a 'housekeeping advice columnist', and while she has no idea of anything related to housework, she resolves to find a house help who can help her with her own column. It is in this capacity that she gets to chat with Aibileen, her best friend Elizabeth's colored help.<br /><br /> As the story unfolds,<br />a strange friendship begins to form between Skeeter and Aibileen. Not a friendship in the beginning, it is more of a relationship that sees both women trying to understand the world of the other. While Skeeter wants to overcome the racial boundaries and tries to be friends with Aibileen and try to understand what she must be going through with so much discrimination and ill-treatment each day, Aibileen wants to figure out how a white woman suddenly is trying to reach out to her, trying to be friends, asking after her life and her feelings!<br /><br /> As Skeeter begins to see more of Aibileen, she enters a circle that was till now invisible to her. While interacting with her best friends Elizabeth and Hilly, she begins noticing their attitude towards their maids, and the way they treat them. She also remembers her own upbringing at the hands of her colored maid, Constantine, and realises that Constantine must have faced many such humiliations too, even though she never complained. When Skeeter sends a job request to a publishing house editor, she is asked to write something fruitful, something that is different, something that catches the pulse of the society, something that talks about a 'change.' Interacting with Aibileen and seeing the attitudes of her friends, Skeeter realises soon what she is going to talk about.<br /><br /> What begins as a relationship between Skeeter and Aibileen as the former starts to write about her life and experiences, soon grows into a bond that both begin to cherish, and very soon, Minnie also joins the two, sharing her own experiences, and the trio form an unlikely bond, an unlikely friendship.<br /><br /> With racial discrimination growing and colored facing inhuman treatment at the hands of the whites, discontent is everywhere, and very soon, many colored women join Skeeter in the secret mission of writing about their lives and experiences.<br /><br /> When the book comes out, the entire white society is shaken up, and its effects are felt everywhere. At the time when Martin Luther King and apartheid were a burning truth in society, the topics that Skeeter, Aibileen and Minnie deal in are sure to come with their own burning results - and they do.<br /><br /> Characters:<br /> What I loved about the novel is Stockett's portrayal of the characters. While Aibileen, Minnie and Skeeter are clearly the protagonists, the antagonist in the story, Hilly Holbrook, is a character who is drawn to the last bit of detail. She is clearly meant to be hated, and Stockett manages to get just that out of her readers. By the end of the novel, I was cheering for Hilly's problems and humiliations - clearly doing exactly what the author intended me to do. The other character who is extremely adorable even in her quirky ways, is Celia Foote, the 'yellow-haired' bimbo, who is termed as 'white trash' by the society ladies and is made into a social outcast, even despite her many attempts to gel into society and be a part of the Jackson elites. While others derogate Celia for her 'vulgar' ways, we get to see her attitude towards her 'help', whom not only does she treat as an equal, but whose maid, Minnie, is surprised at Miss Celia's attitude, as no white lady ever treats a 'colored' maid this well.  Another character who ends up being likeable is Skeeter's mother, who is constantly trying to teach her daughter to behave lady-like, constantly nagging and telling her to wear this, do this, do that, and constantly manages to irritate Skeeter. The next character is Elizabeth Leefolt, a white who is not as rich as the society ladies of her times, but who is doing all she can to make it up. She is in awe of Hilly, her best friend, and ends up doing things the way Hilly says or wants. When faced with a tricky situation, she goes by what Hilly tells her to do, not by her own instinct. We also see her complete dependence on her 'colored' maid Aibileen, who she leaves to take charge of her infant entirely, but for whom she gets a separate toilet made out in the garage, just because Hilly didn't approve of the colored maid and the guests using the same toilet.<br /><br /> The book is a MUST-READ for anyone who would like to read a narration that is set in an important historical era, an issue that stirred up the world and that was one of the biggest causes of the past, and sometimes, even today. Though it is a work of fiction, the author has borrowed instances from many real-life events. At the end of the book, she gives us an insight into her own life, how she and her siblings were brought up by a colored help, and how she never thanked her for it. She says she too had behaved like many of these white women in her own life as a child, not giving much thought to her colored help, and is now truly ashamed of her thoughtlessness. The book will make many of us take another look at the way we treat our helps, at the way we treat those in society who are at lower rungs, and many times, treated poorly because of that.<br /><br /> Kathryn Stockett has given us a winner. Of course the movie received many international awards and nominations, but the book is any day much much more and much more detailed. A movie can never have the time and the logistics to completely capture the book's every detail, and it is because of this that I would recommend that you definitely read the book, even though you may have seen the movie.

B006R1T40I|5.0|I've been cutting down on buying CDs and vinyl lately (even ones from my very fave artists), but I'm sure glad I decided to stick with Bonnie for 'Slipstream'! I believe this may be her best album since 'Nick of Time'...or even since BEFORE that one. I've been a Raitt fan since the start and have had the pleasure of seeing her \\"live\\" on many occasions, both before and after her well-deserved Grammy wins and the recognition that followed (finally!!!!!). Although her studio albums have been great at times, I never felt that they adequately showed off her real talents as a singer/slide guitarist. 'Slipstream' is the exception. This one seems designed to put her playing and singing right up front where it belongs without allowing any of us to ignore her tight, excellent band and guest artists (the brilliant Bill Frisell, to name just one). The material (one song co-written by Bonnie Bramlett, partly why I bought this CD!) is all very good to excellent (with one exception for me...\\"Marriage Made in Hollywood\\" is only so-so), a rarity in these days of single MP3 downloads. The entire album has a \\"live\\" feel to it that was just made for Bonnie's type of music --- blues, soul and rock 'n' roll. I certainly wouldn't categorize Bonnie Raitt as a \\"pop\\" artist as Amazon has done, but some of her past studio albums can be misleading. If you like Bonnie's studio stuff but are up for some excellent, loud and rockin' blues to accompany her beautiful ballads, go see her in person. Or get a taste of what she's really about with this new studio album, produced by Bonnie and by the great Joe Henry. It's such a pleasure to hear Bonnie's intimate vocals and immaculate, bluesy guitar playing, sometimes trading off with a band member's guitar licks, on one of her studio albums. Next...I'm hoping for a REALLY GOOD \\"live\\" album from the modern day Queen of the Blues: Bonnie Raitt!

0345803485|2.0|Let me preface this review by saying that I read this book before it was released through an ARC given to me by LibraryThing. I sort of was ambivalent to it and it wasn't really my thing so I just moved on. When the second installment came out I read it and I liked it alright-same with the third. Now, months later, coming back and re-reading the novel, I see many major plot and writing issues I overlooked the first time mainly because it was a first attempt by the author at writing.<br /><br />I really don't like this book. At all. The relationship between the hero and heroine is so bizarre that I'm not surprised that this work originated as Twilight fan-fiction (This brought up some other points for me which I'll discuss later.) I don't really like either characters-both are needy children who rely on each other to tell one another how messed up each other is. Christian has some serious mommy issues. Furthermore, the style of writing in this novel is quite childish. Christian refers to his mother as the \\"crackwhore\\" all the time. Crackwhore? Couldn't you have been a bit more original? Don't even get me started on Anna's \\"Inner goddess\\" crap; I could go on all day about how annoying it was. Looking back, the lead characters truly do remind me of Stephanie Meyers Bella and Edward from the novel \\"Twilight\\" (another piece of bad writing). They all are just...awful. Awful and whiny.<br /><br />All of these issues aside, I suppose something that has shocked me about this series is how insanely popular it is. A bestseller? Really?! There is nothing bestseller about this drivel! I honestly can envision all these little housewives sitting at home cautiously foraying into the world of BDSM and *gasp!* OMG there's....SEX! A lot of it! And, what?! There's spanking? Calm my heaving bosom!<br /><br />Look, I'm not new in the world of BDSM literature so I really think it's an insult to call this BDSM. There isn't any respect, which, as most avid readers (of romance, anyway) can tell you, that's what BDSM is driven by-respect and trust. This book is an insult to those who practice this safe and purely consensual lifestyle. So I suppose that's where I end this review. This isn't really BDSM, so if you're a Nora Roberts fan looking to spice up your collection go right ahead and purchase this, but make sure you purchase Twilight too. You wouldn't want to miss out.ell you, that's what BDSM is driven by-respect and trust. This book is an insult to those who practice this safe and purely consensual lifestyle.

They are super durable and love being able to hose them off after the work week. They do run big so watch out! I wear a 13 in most shoes an an 11 in these! Just bought the navy because i love them and im feelin' rich!
B004FOA84A|4.0|I played this immediately after the Mystery of the Crimson Manor, and it really feels like it was trying to be the same game. To be fair, a point-and-click adventure game featuring puzzles around a an abandoned mansion is hardly a new idea, but it felt like plagiarism.<br /><br />Regardless, the Secret of Grisly Manor holds up ok on its own.<br /><br />Pros: Challenging puzzles, point-and-click gameplay, decent atmosphere<br /><br />Cons: way too short (about 1/2 hour), poorly detailed graphics (looks like very old compression), a couple of seemingly arbitrary puzzles/solutions<br /><br />Conclusion: I pray that we are seeing a revival of point-and-click adventure games for tablets. Buy this game if you have 49 cents to spare, enjoy classic adventure games, and have already played the Mystery of Crimson Manor.
B007C4ZJ3K|4.0|I am an unabashed Soderbergh fan, but I know there is good Soderbergh and bad Soderbergh. This had the potential to be a real knockout in the Bourne vein, but I don't believe it was aiming for such great heights. This is just a fun movie that is really enjoyable. The music really lets us know that this is fun escapism and the set pieces are really cool. And say what you will but Gina Carino was actually pretty good for someone who is not a professional actress. I can see why its getting the negative reviews it's getting but If you know going in that this movie likes to take it's time I think you can see how much fun it really is.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|Love It, Love It, Love It! Very sleek, nice color, well made, in style, the detail is great. My sister liked better then her's.
B0053O89KG|5.0|I love watching Castle and Becket and by purchasing it I can watch it over and over.  They have such great interaction and I love the story line.
B000021XS0|2.0|I bought this CD for 3 bucks at a used CD shop.  I wanted to get into Dream Theater because I'm a tremendous prog rock fan.  I ended up being deeply disappointed in this CD/album.<br /><br />More often than not, Dream Theater sounds like they simply borrow bits from all the other prog rock bands out there, and try to mesh into their own style, but it doesn't work at all, at least not on this CD/album.  I recognise the influences here.  When I'm listening to the album, I can hear Metallica, Rush, ELP, Yes, Pink Floyd, and even Ravi Shankar/Indian influences.  But, unfortunately, the influences don't really mess.  They're all over the place without becoming cohesive, and the album doesn't work at all.  The musicianship is generally very good, but it feels cold and mechanical.  The lyrics are tremendously pedestrian and borderline stupid.  The lead vocalist is desperately trying to bring emotion to the awful lyrics, and he ends up making them worse.  There is one tremendous song that I have played over and over again, and that's Beyond this Life.  Even though the lyrics and singing aren't very good, the music on that one track is fantastic.  But the other tracks don't stay with me.  Hopefully, there's better Dream Theater stuff out there.
B005NJ2K6U|5.0|This game is an interesting take on match 3.  The first time I played, I looked up and it was an hour later.<br /><br />The bugs I saw earlier, including save game issues all appear fixed.  The game sometimes has trouble distinguishing between a double-tap and two taps nearby (to swap gems) but that's more hardware.<br /><br />Droid X
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I didn't expect to like this book, and I had actually refused to read it. A student talked me into reading the first book, and I became hooked on the series! There is a strength to the main character that I think was not as developed in the first part of the first book, and maybe that was purposeful, but I yearned for her to *want* to do more to change her future, and she seemed to just play along for too long. I am very happy for where she, and the author for that matter, took her future and the story. There is a moral in the story, and that is what I thought was missing in the beginning. With a storyline this strong and with such a draw of emotion, there needs to be more substance than just a scary/blood-pumping story, and it was there after all!<br />I loved being able to read it instantly on my iPad when I finished the first hardback book, and it was a reasonable price for a future classic series.
B005I6EU7U|3.0|The case looks really nice and the quality is great; but, it looks like I'm carrying around a bible instead of a cool Tech Toy. Anyways, there is a magnet device that comes with it that leads you to believe that the cover kind of clings back together and it doesn't. So there isn't anything keeping the cover closed and sometimes it comes open in my purse. Other than that it does what it is ssupposed to do... protect your device
B004MC8CA2|5.0|You Bible is so handy, except in a church service because a phone call interrupts every- thing, I can have quiet time anywhere. Multiple versions are easily accessed one at a time so if I<br />strugle with a verse I can read it in other trans- lations. I have no excuses for not keeping my mind renewed and transformed. This is the only five star app.
B003ZPB57E|5.0|I buy this book for my teenagers, friends, co-workers & several times for myself because I give my copy away so often. Insightful in the simplest way. Relaxing read with much to be learned.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is awesome! Many many hours of fun!<br />My kids even love to play these games. Many different types of games in one!
B0060AY6FO|1.0|This book was boring, and for a mystery  writer, James put no mystery in this book.  Sorry I ever bought it.
B007PTJOV0|3.0|Not to easy to naviate in the nook tablet . Just like the old mario game on the nitendo  Not bad considering its free and it can help you pass the time
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is filled with fun things. you have to try to earn acorns and coins to get animals. you Also get blue stars when you get all of them you go on to the next level.
1597801585|1.0|I was looking forward to this book especially because it was award-winning. However, I found the characters unsympathetic, the syntax and prose hard to follow and one chapter didn't seem to connect to the next. I really didn't see the point of the title since the character it was named from spent very little time in the pages of the book. Her relationship with the lead also had no chemistry. The author has little insight into the female psyche. . . I came to the book looking for a new angle to view dystopian society and came back thinking that the author was also still looking for it, as well.
B0009VSB06|3.0|This is the first metal detector we've ever had.  There have been many times where we will get a strong signal, dig forever, recheck, and there is no longer anything there.  We are VERY careful when digging, so it's not that we flung the item somewhere by accident.  Also, when showing what you've found on the screen, it constantly flashes between categories.
B0078N2MTE|4.0|What's frightening about this movie is not the visions themselves, but the inability to understand them.  This culminates in the movie's conclusion where the realization that you were right is overtaken by the reality that you are right.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|One of the best rdp for mobile devices, worth every penny. I have it on my phone and ipad and works great on both.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this games is awesome get it NOW if you dont have it. I highly recommend it please get it now
B006VA3ZT6|5.0|Great over the top dramatic series with a little humor thrown in the mix.  Maggie Smith is outstanding  as usual.
0375851569|5.0|The books are the same ones you and I both grew up with and they're still as enjoyable as ever. I bought this as a gift for my friend's daughter and she must've read it or had her mom read it to her about ten times over already. Quality hardcovers come in a nice sturdy case to keep them all together on your bookcase. Quality binding, great print quality... yeah, you simply can't go wrong with this.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|this is a great game when u r bored so yeah buy it! i recomend it! om nom makes me feel cute and little like hin eating candy and in a bubble i loved the reguler cut the rope toooooo(:
B007SYWFRM|5.0|most people dont like these kind of games but i do if you get a chance play the game it is amazing.
B004EPYZT4|3.0|I had been eagerly anticipating this movie for some time & was excited too being a fan of the 1982 classic movie & the comics; following the production of the film & seeing the trailers online kept me enthusiastic but finally the finished product I saw in the movie theater was nowhere close to the epic I had been yearning for. Despite mainstream belief, this isn't a reboot whatsoever but another vision of the expansive sword & sorcery world of creator Robert E. Howard. Jason Momoa gives an excellent performance as the cimmerian hero & he's truly perfectly cast as Conan though I can't say the same for Rose McGowan's flat delivery as the villainess Marique. It's not a terrible film but it needed more of an ambitious drive instead of it feeling like a rushed story. Still, Nisepl keeps the Hyborian world intact with all it's monstrous brutality & action, & this alone deserves another shot with Momoa in the lead.
B005WLQQ4Q|5.0|I'm 23, and I love this CD! My neighbors, younger sisters, and cousins (who range from 7 to 24 years old) really have have a lot of fun jamming to the tracks, especially \\"Music Sounds Better With U\\" and \\"Elevate\\" and \\"If I Ruled the World.\\"<br /><br />I have been a boyband fan since the NSYNC/Backstreet Boys days, and out of nostalgia, gave these guys a chance... now I adore these guys! I think some people fail to take them as seriously as musicians due to the fact they're on Nickelodeon, but I don't think it's entirely fair. Sure, they sound very, very pop, but pop can easily be FUN for everyone. Some of their music is quite reminiscent of NSYNC... the songs \\"All Over Again\\" and \\"Show Me,\\" for example.<br /><br />They've got the talent (sound even better live), the heart, the charm, and the good music to share for anyone who is willing to give them a chance!<br /><br />I'd recommend this CD for boys under 13, girls under 25, and parents/grandparents. Or anyone who's into pop music :)
B0002DKCMG|5.0|The scenes with Lucy Lawless as Amsterdam's Madame Vandersexxx are priceless. I've been to Europe a few times, but never has as much fun as I did when watching this DVD.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The horror!  Accidently ordered printed version of book two by clicking the Amazon link my male friend sent me and was considering sending it back so I could order the first book via Kindle - based solely on his recommendation.  Phew!  Glad I read all the reviews; most of which appear to be a lot more entertaining than the book!  Now the damned thing is going back and staying there, still in the box it was shipped in and completely unread!<br /><br />Thank you one and all for saving me from your pitiable fates.  I feel like you have kept me from accidentally ingesting a slow-acting intellect poison.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Amazon \\"allowed\\" me to keep it!  CRAZY!  Can't even send the thing back.  Will donate to a library which caters to the listless cerebrum, I suppose.
B007UMLE5Q|5.0|This episode is one of the best movies I've seen in years!  I had to watch it three times to dissect, savor and take it all in.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I bought this game for my kindle fire last night and have become extremely addicted. After reading other reviews, I found the main complaint to be about exiting the game. As a first time user last night, I also found this to be extremely aggravating. An easy way to solve this conflict is be going to the bottom, right-hand corner, and then go to the very bottom of the list to &quot;options&quot;. The arrow at the bottom of the screen should then pop up so you can safely exit the game. I love this game and hope my review helped!
B004132I20|5.0|I have watched and enjoyed the Jeremy Brett version of Sherlock Holmes.  This modern version has some alteration of spirit but it is just as intense plots true to Conan Doyle.  The inclusion of 'comic relief' was a nice addition.  The character of Dr. Watson got more coverage in character development and I think that makes their partnership more believeable and enjoyable.  I still watch the other sherlocks that I own but this will be an entertaining addition.  I wish I could visit London-good background shots.
B005CM9DX6|5.0|I can't believe how much I like this Opeth release!!!  They totally went in a different direction with this one.  The sounds they captured are just WOW!!  I like this even more then then Dream Theater's 2011 release and they are my favorite band.  To me album of the year for 2011.<br /><br />Go in with an open mind, and you will enjoy it a lot!!
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Like the forecasts and ability to save multiple locations.  However, this app causes my Kindle Fire to freeze up when I try to check the radar map. :( I've had to do a hard shutdown to get out of the app.
B007IX383I|4.0|I saw 2 members of this band open for Blackfield last year in Philly and thought meh, not for me.  The way everyone has been talking about this release I figured WTF for 7 bucks I'll check it and give them a try.  Glad I did. It is a beautifully stunning album.  Not what I normally listen to, but very enjoyable.  Very good album to relax too.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|This book is the BEST love story i have ever read in my life... aand i read a lot.  The plot in this romance is so unexpected you cant help but to feel such happiness after reading it!!  It really is just an adorable story with a stunning storyline!!<br /><br />  -B. Br@ndt
B007VGXS8M|1.0|I went to go get it I looked and I tried to get it but after a day later it said removeing from cloud but it just frustrating. I though it was my sister but then I downloaded the app again then it did the same thing happened
B006PHD0RW|5.0|this is one of the best games ive played in a long time. I cant until the new isle opens.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this app is great!!! the ppl who insult it r having problems cuz of their device not the app so :P
B007IXWL2C|5.0|There has never been a more guilty pleasure. The characters gain a bit of complexity in this third book of the series.  Didn't want the book to end!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This so far had been the best Android Bible app I have downloaded and used. Using different versions of the Bible is a plus when visiting different churches. Works on both my bionic and my Xoom without issues.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|The case arrived in eco friendly packaging. Has a good quality to it, doesn't feel cheap at all. The Kindle Fire fit snugly into it so no slipping or bouncing around. Cover seems to clean my screen when closed and bouncing around in my bookbag. I think it's the fuzzy type of material that's like a cleaning cloth. Doesn't add a lot of extra weight, which is perfect because the Kindle Fire is kind of heavy to hold for too long. Band around the back allows for your right hand to slide under it, giving you a bit more confident grip when reading. Stand is stable and quick to setup. No complicate folding, just fold the cover back and find the slot. When finished using it, wrap it around to cover and that' it. Overall, really pleased with this purchase. I was looking at the more expensive covers but really trying to avoid adding weight to the Kindle Fire. This case is perfect in that regard and at a fair price.
B00632HWOG|1.0|Yahoo now has a flashing ad bar at the bottom of the screen. I can't tolerate it but maybe you can.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|I love this  game great job! So  much fun, me and kids love it!  I think me more than the kids!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|lots of fun. didn't know how to allocate points best the first time through and got stuck. its mindless but fun.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Very nicely done. Fun to pass the time with. And if you like Mario games, you will definately enjoy Lep's World.
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|I wasn't sure what I would think of this movie, watching Puss in Boots without Shrek and all the rest of the cast. Especially considering I am a dog person. It probably helps that Puss is cute and animated and doesn't scratch up my furniture! This was a really cute movie and I laughed a lot. Humpty Alexander Dumpty... now he was an interesting addition. Sometimes I was annoyed by him and then other times I was totally amused. He was especially funny when he thought he blended in with the goose's golden eggs when he zipped himself up into his golden suit. And Kitty Soft-Paws was a pretty good foe/friend for Puss. The only problem with these \\"prequels\\" is that they add these really nice love interests that we like, but they appear nowhere in the entire Shrek saga! Puss was always the only main character who stayed single. Hmmm... maybe this is why!<br /><br />Highly recommended. I wonder what's next. \\"Donkey's Story\\"? That should be fun!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|play this game!I love it. the only thing I don't like is that you have buy the games with your points.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|liked it it was very fun liked most of the games in it I recommend it hope others enjoyed this game
B001AQR3IU|5.0|Who knew this would be so fun! Great ensemble cast, good storyline. Very engaging characters. Original bought this as a gift for my other half and sat down to watch it with her expecting to be wishing I was doing something else but thoroughly enjoyed it.
B002SR2PKG|4.0|Well its just scary as hell, well writen and without a doubt one of the best SK books. And its far from the movie, which only covers a small part of this epic story.
B0058M94M0|4.0|I bought the CD over the book specifically because Frank Skinner was reading. For those of you who know of Frank Skinner he is a comedian from the same region and hence accent of Ozzy. He aces it. You could almost be listening to the great man himself. Five stars for Frank, but only four for the book (on CD), far too short.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|lots of games to play and I like playing them also it works great....I like this app alot and it helps me get threw the day
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Excellently what I've waited a couple years for! (Since my phone with calendar/notepad crashed.)  Only one drawback: recording any previous dates' stuffs into the calendar trips up the default-y reminder thing.  Otherwise, perfect!  :D
B004UHL9EK|4.0|I bought the pro version recently after using the free app for about a month. Their tech support is excellent and issues mentioned in the past reviews have been addressed. I use this every day as an alarm clock and use the timer for laundry. I like the stopwatch, too. Nice clean app. Easy interface.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|this book is very interesting...kind of weird at first but once you get in to love story itself, its a great book.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Really great! I really like the autofill feature! I have this on my Kindle Fire and it is large and easy to see too!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|this book is a page turner...i loved it and im so excited for the next one!! its smart sexy and nerve wrecking....great book.
B003Y5H5EW|3.0|I like the series but this is probable the worst sequel.  I still liked enough to recommend it.  I'm not sure why but the movie appeared to be moving away from its original idea of two loners meeting and needing each other.
0887306667|4.0|The digital world has changed marketing so significantly since this book was written I was not sure how it would stack up in today's world.  I would say it stacks up very well and still has huge relevance for marketing in the new environment.<br /><br />As with other classic business books such as In Search of Excellence and Good to Great some of the examples have lost their way. In some cases this is by violating the rules themselves which does not detract from them being used as an example at the time.  Others may have shown that the laws are subject to other economic or business impacts.<br /><br />All the rules have relevance today and the insights into growing awareness and sales are simple and accessible.  A quick and easy read which gives a simplicity that I like.  The book enables you to focus very easily on the `laws' that are most relevant to the challenges and opportunities which you face.<br /><br />A great read, well worth the time invested.
B00009W0U4|1.0|I bought this movie and must say I was deeply disturbed by the violent portral of the rape of the actress. Her face being kicked and punched to a pulp was utterly sick. I realize this must happen in real life, and I am truly sorry for women this happens to, I just don't need to see it in my home.<br /><br />Another feature of the film that made me almost seasick from the start was the camera technique of swirling the camera around and tilting it different directions. I guess if one is high on acid, this makes sense?<br /><br />This review is my own personal opinion and I don't expect anyone to be impressed, only hope to help some folks avoid wasting their money on a worthless movie.<br /><br />If I could return it, I would do so, I guess I will hang the CD in my garden to scare away the birds!<br /><br />Save your money and don't buy this worthless effort. IMHO
B0029LHW68|5.0|this is a Great CD. from beginning to end.  I would recommend this to anyone that likes this genere of music.
B00828G57Y|5.0|I was so shocked by the way things have taken a turn in The Vampire Diaries Season Three. I can only imagine the direction things will go in season four. I just hope they don't make her brother Jeremy into the \\"new\\" bad guy.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|AWESOME! I love this game! Amazing! Best app I've ever had!!! I highly recommend this amazing app! Get this app. What the heck it's free. Might as well try it.
B000002BNB|5.0|First off let me tell everyone that Amazon has two different versions of this album, the original release of this album has 17 tracks and the song \\"The Soul Controller\\" is on it at track 16, now on the newer version of this album it only has 16 tracks and \\"The Soul Controller\\" is not on there due to sample clearances. Luckily the one I found had it. Now on the review, Ghostface did his thing on here with the classic \\"All That I Got Is You (Feat. Mary J)\\" which is one of the most heartfelt songs in hip hop history. \\"The Faster Blade\\" is a Raekwon solo, which is very dope, \\"Wildflower\\" Ghost has some harsh words to say about a disloyal female he was dealing with, then you have \\"Marvel\\", \\"Motherless Child\\",\\"Camay\\" & \\"Winter Warz\\" (Where Cap spits one of the best verses of all time). Every song on here is worth listening to this is a classic Hip Hop album.
B001QW8QYS|1.0|The video wouldn't stream continuously. We never saw the entire film. We watched *The Robe\\" in wide screen with no problem at all.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|The characters are very real and believable.  The storyline draws the reader into the plot and builds suspense that has the reader not wanting to put the book down.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Brillant read! Could not put it down until I had read all three. Way better than the movie because the movie has changed or let out so much of the story.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|A very easy and understandable read.Easy to locate books and verses on my Kendle Fire.<br />I could not ask for any better reference.
0446572993|5.0|I have read all of Baldacci's books and this one had me questioning all the way to the end.  Read it in 3 days, and would have probably read it in one day except I started it on Monday during lunch and full time job got in the way! If you love a book that makes you want to cheap and read the last chapter, then I highly recommend this book.  Now that I have read it, I can't wait for a follow up because it did leave you with questions of \\"What happens to ....\\" Main character is one you can believe and feel his loneliness and his heart & soul.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|On the surface, this book is cheerful, light-hearted, and delightful.  Underneath, it gently and subtly explores important themes about loyalty, friendship, and love.  And it also touches on the gift of reading, which always warms my heart.<br /><br />The book is comprised entirely of letters written either by or to the main character, Juliet Ashton.  Juliet is a resident of London, who spent her days during World War II writing humorous newspaper articles documenting the war under a pseudonym by day and fighting to protect her city, especially its beloved books, from German bombs at night.  Now Juliet is looking for a new topic to write about when she stumbles upon the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society.  Guernsey is one of the English channel islands that were occupied by the Germans during the war, and Juliet soon gets to know the members of the literary society through letters they exchange.  While they discuss the topic of how reading helped the society members survive the pain of occupation, they also discuss how they cared for each other, each complete with their fears and flaws.  I am surprised to find myself tearing up as a write this, but I guess I shouldn't be surprised.  This book really touched my heart.  And it taught me a little something new about World War II, England, and human decency as well.<br /><br />This book doesn't have page-turning thrills.  Despite the war theme, there are no graphic descriptions of blood and gore.  Instead, it has something much better . . . people becoming their best under the worst of circumstances.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Game is easy enough to grasp quickly and challenging enough to make me want to improve each round.  Great fun
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Omg!! Spicy, invegorating, sensual...just a few things that come to mind! I couldn't put the book down until I finished the trilogy!! This book is sure to spice things up in the bedroom!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the online version of the bible.I especially enjoy bring able to pull multiple versions at once once. I only wish we could download it once and for all but receive periodic updates.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book has virtually no plot and the characters are not even believable. Very poorly written and a topic that holds no interest for me. I cannot believe this is a bestseller!!!!
0393088774|1.0|After reading this book, I was very disappointed. Seems every thing he wants to do is what got us in trouble in the first place.
B006R1T40I|5.0|I've always loved Bonnie's music.  But this album is extra special.  The slide guitar is dazziling as usual for Bonnie.<br />I keep the CD in my car and listen to it over and over.  Great choice if you love the blues!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I had no idea what I was getting into with Fifty Shades of Grey but,like so many others, I felt compelled to keep reading.  My usual preference is for authors like Joan Didion, Ann Patchett, Wally Lamb, Joyce Carol Oates etc. but I did enjoy this walk on the steamy side. The characters were likable and believable enough. I rooted for them to build trust and become more grounded without losing their passion and respect for each other.  I also enjoyed the exploration of parental influence on the development of a child's character.  Of course, the sex, passion, and lust were tons of fun, too. Definitely a guilty pleasure.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I use it often and I love it just make sure u chose the right video clip so u don't ended up with some singers wanna be songs
B004UUKDNA|3.0|I seldom buy CDs anymore as I don't want to have to keep up with an ever-expanding collection, and because more often than not, most of the album is filler. I had heard three songs by Foster the People on heavy rotation on many stations, and then a fourth one(Houdini) has started getting airplay. I decided it was safe and bought the CD, which I now regret. I don't really see myself listening to any songs other than the hits.<br /><br />In this particular case, it's not necessarily because the rest of the album is filler, but rather the rest of the album seems to be of a whole different genre. Instead of alternative rock with a decent bit of synthesizers, almost everything else sounds like overly-produced synthetic pop-crap. Mark Foster has shown he can actually sing in a more normal timbre, so I wonder why he's always going for this falsetto stuff?<br /><br />It's a shame, because their live performances indicate that they have a lot of talent to put on a rocking show. It does make me wonder if their next album will be more rock-oriented to go along with what's proven to be successful instead of the poppy stuff which hasn't as much.<br /><br />I'll give it three stars because Pumped Up Kicks, Houdini, and Helena Beat are all very good songs, but according to one of the other reviewers here you can get those three by themselves on a cheaper EP.
B005QUQ99K|4.0|I bought this for my 6 year old Grandson for his Birthday and he was so excited. He just loves it.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love this app.  The only thing I would fix is how the picture slides around.. I wish you could secure it in the position you need.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|I would have given the book 5 stars, but I don't like all the swearing in the book.  Otherwise it was a good book to read, I was hooked right away.
B0076L9W9Q|4.0|ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br /><br />Their first album was great.  It sucked me in from start to finish.  I think this album is slightly better than many artists' second albums, but...<br /><br />Bands often spend several years trying to make it; they write songs with power, emotion, and conviction.  Then they get signed to a record deal.  Their first album is insane because they've worked on it their entire lives.  However, they now have a year or two to come up with that many more NEW songs.  This is where the great succeed and the mediocre struggle.  There are very few bands who produce excellent second and third albums.  I just think these guys are caught in that struggle.<br /><br />I will admit, the album is brand new to me and it might grow on me a bit.  But my initial impression falls way short when compared with that from the first album.  I prefer Nightwish, Fireflight, Epica, and Within Temptation.  If you don't care for those bands, you might like this album more than me.<br /><br />NEW UPDATED REVIEW:<br /><br />Having rocked out in the gym much more recently to this album than their first, I recently upgraded this album to a 4/5 because it took awhile to grow, but it did grow.  And now I enjoy it almost as much as the first album.  It's not as original as the first album, but that's usually the case with a band you're listening to for the first time (duh).  I still enjoy my Nightwish, Fireflight, Epica, and Within Temptation.  No, those bands don't sound like Halestorm, but they all have a powerful female vocal.  And I really enjoy that.
0307279189|5.0|Not only a great narrative and touching story, but packed with studies and facts. It would be hard to read this book and not come away with the desire to just get out there and run for the joy of it.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|It may have taken a little while to get it for the kindle fire, but I don't care. I love this game! Thanks to the people who make the apps!! I'm sure its a lot of work to get your product on every device out there. I'm very appreciative of all the hard work.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|had this on my comp love all /the different puzzles. will keep u entertained for hours. can put it down and pick up where u left off later
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I read this book several weeks ago and have continued to share how much I enjoyed this moving (and at times, heart-wrenching) story.  The author did a fantastic job of expressing the emotions for the two main characters that enable the reader to also experience them.  I highly recommend this book!!
B004GJXQ20|4.0|This is an amazing fantasy with well wrought characters with depth. The imagery is well done and a story line somewhere between Tolkein and Quentin Taratino.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I own hundreds of kindle books and I have never, ever before written a review.  Usually other reviewers say everything I could hope to say and hardly any seasoned kindle customer truly follows the actual rating.  I relate this only to let those of you know my rating and review are as unbiased as possible. This book truly is a 5 star book.  These reviews are not fake.  This book is a must read by an obviously talented author.  For more information on the book itself read the other reviews.
B003VANOFY|3.0|Let me preface this by saying that I am almost exclusively a Logitech user. And having had this headset for less than a year, it definitely is a good headset...but I remain unconvinced that this is a $120 headset.<br /><br />Pros: The battery life is fantastic, the weight and size is just right, the Logitech suite of tools is great.<br /><br />Cons: Constant de-sync with the base, even away from any interference, a TON of tinkering required before use with any given voice client (user tested Skype and Ventrilo), when you do broadcast noise, it's BAD.
B007R41E8O|3.0|my favorite part of this app was the ending. decent to see a bit or originality in these apps. would rate 4 stars but there was only one major issue though: the zodiac slider puzzle was so glitched out that I unfortunatley had to use the &quot;skip puzzle&quot; option. litterally it was impossible to complete because several of the tiles would warp into one another and become stuck in one spot. devs need to fix this for the kindle fire ASAP.<br />provided an hour or two of entertainment so well worth a buck.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|This is a free, fun, addictive, game that anyone with a smartphone should have. The people reporting bugs must have cheap phones, \\"time for a upgrade\\". Get it today!
B007R41E8O|4.0|Tricky but fun.  graphics a good and tasks challenging.  Definitely worth the price for an evening's entertainment.  I really enjoy hidden object games when combined with an interesting story.  And I've gotten a number of fun games from Amazon.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Fun when you have a good partner. However, you will encounter trolls that try to mess with you. Otherwise, great game!
B007SYWFRM|1.0|I hats it. it totally copied tiny village. oh Yahoo and the bar at the bottom of the screen disappeared. the only way that you can get lout of the game is to shut the kindle of completely.

B005K17RU0|5.0|5 star app :) coolest . I always know what the weather is now :) my friends taunt me into writing a bad report on yall&bull; but y'all r too awesome to write a bad report on. :)
B0055SWM08|5.0|The levels are challenging enough to keep you interested and thinking hard, but not so difficult as to be frustrating and unsolvable.
B00723NWJE|1.0|Crap. There is no high in this album. ALL the songs sound the same.  None of the tracks stand out. Total waste of money.
B006LRUVUA|5.0|I have used teamviewer on my PC for several years. I am happy they made and aneroid app, and it even works well. With a bit of time on it controls will be second nature. Only thing I saw so far was it does not zoom out far enough, but that is not a show stopper.
B007ZRZF8I|3.0|This a game you'd play at the doctor's office, or at work if you can. Should've been free but its a nice size screen on the kindle. Lots of detail. Simple concept.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|I was searching Amazon one morning in bed, and thought, yeah, why not, and downloaded it.  I thought this was a teen book, and it's aimed at them, but like Harry Potter, this is a book for all ages.  Characters are believeable, hard to achieve in a book of this genre, and it wasn't predicable. I fully intend reading the next two in the series.
B000FVQLQQ|5.0|its a amazing...<br /><br />Funny how netflix will not release such a classic in streaming video.  I think its their duty to allow a film that teaches us so much about life and coping with a mental illness .  Maybe we can learn from it. This film is the first attempt to show what it is like to deal with a true challenge.<br /><br />So I will buy the film and show it to a wide audience myself and maybe impact someone's life.
B007OAAK0O|5.0|Cannot wait!<br /><br />Love this historical concert!<br /><br />Saw on tv in 1983  remember it well....<br /><br />Very happy it is finally out on dvd!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is one of those games that is fun and challenging. Keeps you on your toes.  Never boring! And free is a bonus.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|This app is just what I wanted. it has tons of selection and is super cool. I LOOOOOOOVE this app. plus all the pictures go right into kindle gallery which can be opened from facebook. So its perfect simply perfect. GET IT!
B00004ZB9D|5.0|I have no idea why I waited over twenty years to finally buy Lenny Kravitz' music. I always enjoyed his tracks but never got around to owning it. How dumb is that? This album has opened up my eyes to that oversight and I'll be purchasing more as long has he's making it.<br /><br />Let Love Rule, Lenny, Let Love Rule! Thank you!
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|I bought this album after hearing her song, \\"Video Games\\", on an online mix before I even knew who she was. I was totally blown away by her beautiful melodic and unique voice and her style of music. It has a sort of retro sound, almost of another era but with some really cool beats and some trip-hop sounds to match. I love her music and I don't see all the fuss and negativity about how she came to be and so on. After I googled her I started reading negative reviews about her music and authenticity, etc. But, I don't care. That didn't stop me from buying her whole album. All it did was make me love her music even more. There are other singers out there that don't sound nearly as good as Lana Del Rey and I can't believe people actually want to put her down.<br />This album packs a punch! My favorites are: Born To Die, (great video too!), Summertime Sadness, Radio, Video Games. Her voice is sultry, rich, sexy, moody. The music glamorously and beautifully dark at times but also sensual, has some very catchy and addictive phrases which just stick in your head long after the music has stopped playing making you want to go back and listen to it again. I hope she continues to make wonderful music like this. As we can see a lot of people are curious to know who she is and in doing so find a real gem like I did.
B004EPYZOO|4.0|I wasn't expecting much out of Drive Angry.  I expected it to be really bland to be honest.  Generic gun shooting action that I've been seeing in abundance for the last 30 years.  It's actually pretty good.<br /><br />First of all *my God is Amber Heard amazingly attractive*.  I just HAD to get that off my chest!  What's more amazing is that she's the kind of woman who can radically change her appearance.  I've seen her in other movies and she looked like a very different woman.  She just has that ability to change the way she looks (and acts for that matter).<br /><br />Anyway, before my hormones got sidetracked, I was going to mention what the story is about.  It's about a man with apparent invincibility powers played by Nicolas Cage and he's chasing after satanic cult members.  He's also running from another man with similar super powers hence the Matrix style slow-motion bullet blasting segments that are actually used to good effect this time.  I can't say the same concerning ALL movies.<br /><br />The character of Amber Heard is that she's someone who actually has a filthy mouth so this is most certainly NOT a movie that children should be watching.  Way too many lines pertaining to sexual-related topics (especially in the beginning when we're first being introduced to the characters) and yeah, certainly not for kids.  Right from the beginning when she's working as a waitress in a diner you will quickly discover what she's like.  You won't like it.  She doesn't hold back *anything!*<br /><br />The violence and suspense is really exaggerated but I honestly wouldn't want it any other way.  Whenever Nicolas Cage is cornered with a loaded gun, he blasts the bad guys apart in really creative, hard to believe blood-splashing ways.  The guy following Nicolas Cage has the same knack for extreme violence.  Watch what happens when the two clash!  You just gotta love it!<br /><br />Overall, it's probably really cheesy but this is one of those examples where the cheesinessis overlooked because it features big name actors and actresses and the acting itself is really impressive and these features override the negatives by far.  I highly recommend it.  You can say it's an entertainingly violent good time!
B0050PLT8W|1.0|If you think this is a great CD your are clearly nit thinking straight. The doo Wop style crap on this CD was unbearable. Every song sounds the same. There is no originality in this CD. Every other one has great music about life and especially past relationships. This is just rehash of crap their producer made them put out. I seriously thought this was a joke when I put it in my CD player. I couldn't believe it. Gasoline and scars and souvenirs are by far their best ever. I want to see these guys in concert again but will not due to the fact that I would have to stomach this crap! Sorry teeny boppers, Nicklebacks fate will not happen to these guys! Please make another rocking album TOAD.
0345803485|5.0|This book was awesome!! I could hardly put it down. I will definitely be buying book two and three. Best book I have read in a long time.

B006UG90RM|3.0|With initial impressions of the much anticipated new Van Halen album A Different Kind Of Truth leaving me with a fair degree of disappointment I wanted to let this one sit with me for a while before reviewing it, but I've now reached the point where I believe that I've given it enough listens (plenty... believe me!) to pass judgement on it.  Could this album have ever been as good as the hype surrounding it and reached the dizzy heights of the expectations of legions of fans around the world?  In reality probably not, and the truth is that for all the hype and expectations it isn't that great, but to be fair it isn't that bad either.<br /><br />After a decade of continual rumours of deals made and broken, David Lee Roth was finally confirmed as being back in the band for a new album, and EVH was reported to be healthy with alcohol & dug issues resolved.  So I couldn't help but think they would pick right up from where they left off with 1984 (my second favourite VH album) but perhaps with some of the best traits of the Van Hagar years infused.  Yeah, I had high expectations.  But surprisingly (to me anyway, perhaps not so to others) they have instead released an album which has far more in common with their first four albums.  All traces of Van Hagar have been expunged for what instead is a return to what could be considered a very retro album.  So much so in fact, that this album could have sat comfortably in 1982 as the album after Fair Warning.<br /><br />There has been a lot of negative comments made in on-line reviews about Diamond Dave's singing on this, how his voice has deteriorated, he's not the singer he once was, blah, blah, blah...  The truth as I see it is that he sounds just fine to me.  Yeah the high pitched \\"wow's\\" of the first few albums are absent, but they were always a little overdone anyway and really belong in the past.  Yeah there are more spoken vocal lines here than on previous Roth albums, but I think overall he really is in fine form here, and if this album isn't what you wanted it to be then the blame doesn't lie with him.<br /><br />I did wonder how they would go without their special hot sauce, Michael Anthony but the truth with that is that whilst the absence of his unique high vocals is noticeable, it doesn't make that much of a difference really.  Whoever they have got doing backing vocals do a reasonable job, and again if this album isn't what you wanted it to be then the blame doesn't lie there either.  Nor does it lie with the playing of the VH brothers or VH Jnr on bass.<br /><br />Where this album disappoints is in the songs themselves.  One would think (and expect) that in the fourteen years (yes 14!!!) between studio albums, EVH would have written enough songs that he would be able to select only the best material for what can only be described as their \\"come back\\" album.  So the fact that they have chosen to recycle some songs that they discarded in the late 1970's is initially quite a surprise.  But then when you think what they were aiming to do, i.e. release an album that does sound like their early years, it's actually probably the best way to get that sound.<br /><br />The trouble with never (pun intended) releasing them until now just confirms though why some of them were discarded in the first place.  Then there's the difficult task of making new songs that sound like their old ones did.  So whilst one might initially think that releasing an album like this is a cop out, I actually think it's a bold move, and I think they have pulled it off fairly successfully.  Why you ask when some of the songs aren't that great?  Well the real truth is that for all the brilliance on the early Van Halen albums and despite their immense popularity and likeability, they also contain what can only be described as some crap too.  So in that regard A Different Kind Of Truth does sit right alongside them, but probably more comfortably with Women And Children First and Fair Warning than VH1 and VH2 asthe latter named (but earlier released) were stronger as a whole.<br /><br />Honeybabysweetidoll is excrement in its purest form and Bullethead isn't much better, and China Town isn't much of a song either.  The Trouble With Never and Beats Workin' are ok songs and not shite by any means, but still average fare really.  Album opener Tattoo doesn't kick things off with a bang like you would expect and is an unusual choice for first single, so this hit me in the guts when I heard it and considerably lowered my expectations of what was gonna come.  Thankfully it isn't the best song on the album, but even so it has grown on me quite a bit so I rate it better than those mentioned above.  Stay Frosty isn't too bad and like many have mentioned, the comparisons to Icecream Man are obvious, but it isn't as good as that song.  Big River is nothing brilliant but still quite enjoyable nonetheless.<br /><br />But the good songs on this album are quite good and are my preferred tracks (in order):<br />Blood And Fire, You And Your Blues, She's The Woman, Outta Space, As Is.  It's just a shame that the rest aren't this good.the latter named (but earlier released) were stronger as a whole.<br /><br />Honeybabysweetidoll is excrement in its purest form and Bullethead isn't much better, and China Town isn't much of a song either.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I adored WOOL, the first of Hugh Howey's dystopian sci fi adventures. I felt like a kid again as I gobbled down the story. It brought back the rush of first discovering Asimov, Clarke, Dick, Dahl, Bradbury, and my personal favorite Theodore Sturgeon. I plan on diving into the series and not coming up for air until I've ingested every tasty morsel.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I am sooooooooo disgusted with all of the bogus negative reviews made against this wonderful movie. I saw it twice in the theater and will watch it more on DVD. If you missed it in the theater, give it a chance,and let it make you smile. The acting is very good and the story and special effects are terrific.

B007V2UGPE|4.0|I am really enjoying this game.  It is simple but has a nice strategy element to it.  Another winner from this company.
B007ZD17XO|4.0|love this game! It rocks! best match the crystal games I've ever played! You gotta buy it for yourself NOW!!!!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I like this game alot. lots of fun u should download it and play it all. the time. for sure
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I very much enjoyed the book.  I felt like the first 100-200 pages were a little rough to get through because of the authors writing style.  With that being said, once you get past this and more into the story it gets much better.  This is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  Also, if you're like me and not a fan of BDSM, I still encourage you to read the book.  It doesn't go as extreme as you think it will (into the whole BDSM world). I will say it dabbles at times on the milder side or what I consider tolerable.  Last, these books are definitely hot and steamy!!!
B003Y5H5EW|4.0|As this is the 4th installment in the franchise, nobody should be surprised that there is ample blood and gore in this action packed treat. The storyline moves the overall franchise forward, but definitely leaves the watcher want another sequel. There were a few minor gaps in the logic, but not in the action. Fans of the series will enjoy this one.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I absolutely moved this book that I ended up reading it about 3 times in 2weeks.<br />By far my most favorite book of all time, wishing that there was a second book (:
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is fun and with the amount of different games they have available you won't get bored. love it.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|This app is really good when you want to edit your pictures. It is also a lot of fun to experiment with all of the features.
1401302378|5.0|With 6 years of hindsight, the author's analysis of the broad impact of the long-tail of consumer demand unleashed by innovations in production, delivery and search, is clearly right-on.  The trends Anerson spotted have continued, in media and other industries, for the reasons he described. None of this is rocket science.  The Pareto Principle (80/20) is a stalwart of managerial finance and operations management curricula and real world applications and decisions.  However, the lowering of media costs means that the activity in the last 20% of the tail is where profitable, non-obvious opportunities lie.  The author does overreach a little at times, but these are not essential to the book.  He does repeat the same application or principle, but usually because it fits in the flow of another argument.  I thought that the economics was solid and that this was and is a more important long-run contribution than Freakonomics or the Tipping Point, although the former was more fun and diverse and the latter provided a broadly applicable new idea that was not so well known.
B0036K3OFY|4.0|this movie is a total popcorn film.  lots of blood, gore, ninjas rising out of the shadows to showdown.  plus it is starring Rain.  see it.
B003Y5H5EW|3.0|Bloody dismemberment is getting so old that the entire genre is now dependent upon how over the top horrific the kills can get just to keep the audience from nodding off. This movie is in that category except that one is left with how it probably feels to be a cow or pig about to be slaughtered except the prey animal in this case is human.<br /><br />Nice pace, sets, mood, CGI especially of the Lycans. The storyline started out fairly interesting but became disjointed (jumped around with not much character depth, thematics and scene continuity) and eventually just sort of ran out of creative gas. Acting was OK although there isn't much acting involved. Action scenes were mostly green screen and wires and seemed old and tiresomely redundant to what's been done in movies now for decades. Kate looks the part but her personality doesn't come through as an action figure you don't want to mess with. Moretz, Ronan and Rapace in their movies, however, did portray that characterization quite effectively.
B004FOA84A|1.0|I purchased the game now it won't install. But for $0.49 I shouldn't have expected any less. I'm disappointed because it looks fun and I will never know :(
B00828G57Y|5.0|I was only somewhat shocked about the turn of events in this episode; I felt it was just a matter of time before certain events occurred (so as not to be too much of a spoiler, I will just say that this is in regard to what happens with Alaric and Elena). Some issues were wrapped up, but we are left with enough cliffhangers to keep us on edge until the show returns in the fall. There were plenty of the twists that keeps fans of the show hooked! All in all, a very exciting season finale for one of the most addictive shows on TV. If a fan of this show, this episode is a must!<br />Just to comment on Vampire Dairies in general and the Twilight comparisons: I gave this show a shot when I was bored with my usual TV fare and wanted something different, waiting to sneer at the \\"cheap Twilight knock-off.\\" But to my surprise, Vampire Dairies is SO MUCH BETTER (and I am a fan of Twilight!). This show is everything Twilight wants to be. The acting is better, the stories more engaging, there are no neat little happy endings, and, for the characters, the lines between good and evil are much more blurred, which, in my opinion, provides for greater dramatic impact. Don't be put off by the demographic this show is aimed at (I am WAY over that line!)- its just a well-made show that deserves greater recognition.
B000YENUI6|4.0|A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE is the better film, but Viggo and Cronenberg always work together great. Watts and the actors portraying the Russian mafioso are excellent as well.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm 35 and not a big fan of this type of stuff in general. I bought it to see what my daughter was wanting to watch, and haha...once I started reading it I couldn't put it down. It's amazingly well plotted, has interesting points and messages, and is not what I expected. I just bought the second and third ones for myself. :) that says it all.
B004I744AS|5.0|Compared to others where you have to use a 'sliding line' to search and locate the word, this is the bomb! Just plug in the letters and you are ready to go!
0345803485|2.0|Its hard for a reader not to pick up a book that everyone is talking about but do yourself a favor and save your money. It was so poorly written that at times it was painful to read ( but not in a hot sexy painful way ) Honestly I dont understand why this book has struck such a cord, but the author must be laughing all the way to the bank
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|Beckensale is the greatest Selene ever, i have all four movies; and this one is no disappointment. i hope they come out with another episode of Underworld saga.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|My, what a great powerful movie along with scenery, etc; the actors were superb and the main actor \\"horse\\" is beautiful beyond words.  I am amazed how anyone could teach a horse how to act and act so well.  This story had me in tears from the beginning to the end and I can see why the movie had so many awards.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I enjoyed this book to say the very very least. I could not stop reading. I hated it, and I loved it so much. The writing is not the VERY best. However, the character development is so amazing. I am touched, started the second books seconds after reading the first.
B007T2XC7A|4.0|This is a great CD: Norah Jones is super classy and talented as always and the addition of Danger Mouse's highly polished mellow electronic sound makes for a perfect chill-out album.  This is a really good blend of two of pop music's top professionals and great collaborators, and a FANTASTIC deal at $5.00!  Put it on while you are writing, researching, doing art, or just plain chilling.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|A teeter totter comes to mind. I have fallen in love with Ana and Christian. They keep me reading. With all of the literary blunders that occur I must say it is a disappointment that this book was published. However, at the same time there is and MUST be something said of a book that makes you sad with a sense of loss when you read the word \\"epilogue\\". I am done, and I am heartbroken with loss. Sigh, it was so good while it lasted.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is great. Very entertaining and totally worth the $0.99. Looks great on Amazon Kindle. Could do with some updates from Amazon though...
B007IXWKUK|5.0|So the bad thing about trilogies is that after reading a second book you just want it to keep going. Why exactly do they have to stop?<br /><br />I was so very pleased with this reading. It was as every bit tantalizing as the first book. I again could not stop reading. My eyes were burning. I needed to go to work, and just like Christian I was an adolescent. I ended up so tired for two days straight unable to sleep for all I could do was read. So very sad.
B007EJ6S92|5.0|Moonspell really outdid themselves on this release! I was so impressed with the quality of sound and I have to say even the packaging on this album is truly top-notch! Not only did it come with one of Moonspell's greatest achievements (Alpha Noir) But it comes with the bonus album (Omega White), which is clean vocals though the entire 8 songs, it is definitely reminiscent of Sin Pecado; In my opinion their greatest albums ever. This release is going to satisfy every Moonspell fan out there, past or present. Happy listening!
B005LAIH2W|4.0|This was a great movie, the \\"Critics\\" actually killed this movie and made a lot of people not go to see it. The Barsoom series were favorites of mine as a kid and I just re-read them prior to this movie coming out. Trying to seriously put a book (or series of books) into film is a very hard task, so the leeway taken with the original story has to be accepted. But the story itself was quite good and the effects were worth the huge amount of money they spent on them. What a shame that the reviews from the critics were so dismal. I have learned that if the critics say it was bad, I go see it first, because I am the average person looking for entertainment value, not the critic looking for some redeeming social value and underlying social commentary. Critics for the most part are MORONS.....
B00475AYJQ|5.0|The Wise Man's Fear: The Kingkiller Chronicle: Day Two is a solid continuation of the main character's retelling of his past thru travels and school. looking forward for the next book
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Grey was sexually shocking, Darker was edge-of-your-seat drama, and Freed, for me, was the most erotic. In Ana and Christian's new relationship status, their exists an intense love and trust, which made their kinky ****ery even more erotic. About half way through the book, there were e-mails alluding to events from the night before and there started to be spaces in time. Having not seen this writing style in the other two books, it felt rushed. The ending was bittersweet. I wasn't ready for their 'situation,' but it made sense in the evolution of the characters. It was hot to see they did not betray the sexuality of their relationship, all things considered.

B007Q2N0HA|4.0|The comparisons to Fifty Shades of Grey are annoying, whether good or bad.  Fifty was great, fantastic, lovely, stirring...etc, etc, etc...and I'm so glad I read it and shared it with friends.<br /><br />But it wasn't the first ever book with a domineering, tortured man falling for a shy, overwhelmed (and yet strong and independent) woman.<br /><br />Bared To You is fabulous.  It's got heat, it's got angst, it's got all the perfect elements for a great story.<br /><br />And I'm so glad I found it and plan on telling fellow readers far and wide about it.  But don't read it because of Fifty.  And don't avoid it because of Fifty.  Read it because it's a story that deserves it's own attention.<br /><br />Congrats, Ms. Day, you have a new reader.  I look forward to reading more from you!

B004G6TCMQ|5.0|This was my first ELP album, and like most people, I purchased it to hear Lucky Man. The remainder of the album held up very well. For years, I have considered this to be amoung my top ten albums. As they say, \\"the album I would take with on a desert island.\\" Of course, the island would have to have electricity.<br />That said, I wish they also would have release an MFSL cd of this; not to mention a half-speed master vinyl album as well.<br />It was this album that generated my interest in classical music, an interest that has never left me. For those of you looking for a terrific introduction of ELP, this is a great place to begin. Their first six albums are my favorites.
B006PAO2FS|5.0|Paul Mccartney's new album is beautiful. The album contains a series of ballads from the American songbook. This has been done by artists like Rod Stewart but the key difference with this work is in the arrangement. The instrumental backing is spare and of extremely high quality. There are no large orchestral moments drowning good songs and Mccartney's vocals are also placed really forward or high in the mix. This old time jazz trio style works perfectly for the material and is something very new in Mccartney's catalogue. In the past, I always felt great mccartney albums would have been better with his vocals louder. In this work, you hear every nuance of his voice and maybe that has put off some of the negative reviewers. This is a great relaxing late night album for fans of \\"and I love her\\" or \\"yesterday\\" type Beatle numbers.

B0059XTV7Q|5.0|Actually a very good well acted,filmed movie,after watching it there is NO DOUBT if it was directed by ANY other than MADONNA it would have been HAILED as a critics masterpiece,,,,I watched this and The Desendants the same day,and BY FAR I enjoyed this movie MUCH more,HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,can't wait to see what the director does next.
B000U0F7RG|1.0|I love the Gilmore Girls and I was so excited to get these DVDs.  I ordered them in late January and it is now May.  I had worked my way through seasons 1-3 and was about to watch the last disk in season 4.  I put the disk in only to find that disk 24 is the same as disk 23.  My very favorite episode, the one where Liz gets married was supposed to be on that disk.  What do I do now?  It is too late to return.
B0025KVLTC|5.0|In looking at the Beatles' discography, SGT. PEPPER is often adored for its futuristic sonics and the sort of psychedelia that captures an era. But such an emphasis on SGT. PEPPER unfairly marginalizes their preceding record, for 1966's REVOLVER marks the true leap into psychedelia. If you think that this album still a transitional effort away from vacuous love ballads, consider this: the track \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\", with its trippy tape loops, artificially generated seagull sounds, and John Lennon repeating Timothy Leary's advice to \\"Turn off your mind, relax and float downstream\\", was the *first* song put down at the REVOLVER sessions.<br /><br />That fact rather changes one's view of the album, doesn't it? George Harrison's two contributions are highly mature, with \\"Taxman\\" a sarcastic view of Britain's revenue service, and \\"Love You To\\" a droning sitar tune that is just as otherworldly as \\"Within You, Without You\\" on SGT. PEPPER. And could there be a more overt 1960s drug song than \\"Dr. Robert\\"? Even the most traditional tracks on this record, whether love songs or the silly \\"Yellow Submarine\\", turn out to be more than meets the eye. Reading [[ASIN:0754605574 Every Sound There Is]], a collection of papers on REVOLVER by a number of prominent musicologists, drew my attention to the innovative recording techniques used on this album.<br /><br />As a listener keenly interested in 1960s psychedelia, I've found REVOLVER to be among the most addictive and rewarding of the Beatles' LPs.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|I was surprised at how big and plastic-y it was, after all the glowing reviews. While it makes a pretty good noise, it's not the sort of thing I can keep in my purse and pull out to write checks with or something. I eventually allowed my kids to wander off with it, and they broke it in pretty short order. Fun while it lasted, I guess.

B0052GACNM|4.0|There is a  wonderful selection of music and artists that perform on this disc. Other than the variety of the different artists, a lot of the music is similar in sound. I saw the PBS broadcast of this album and enjoyed the live performance better because you see Tony working with the individual artists and there is a dialogue between them. On the disk all you get is the music, without the dialogue. If you like Tony however this is the disc for you.  [[ASIN:B0052GACNM Duets II]]

B005LAIHGI|4.0|After establishing himself as a satirical force with Da Ali G Show, Sacha Baron Cohen took his style of free-form, guerrilla comedy to the big screen with the brilliant Borat, a film that turned him into something of a cultural icon. The film was sharp, topical, and unpredictable in a way many spoofs simply can't replicate. Keeping up that level of success proved to be harder than many thought, as Cohen followed it up with the terribly unfunny supermodel film, Bruno, that seemed to stumble in every way that Borat got right. The Dictator, while marketed as being a sort of spiritual and creative cousin to Borat, is a total departure for Cohen, as it relies heavily on traditional Hollywood storytelling and jettisons the unscripted stuff we've become so accustomed to. The change hasn't effected Cohen in the least, as The Dictator is just as incendiary and depraved as we all hoped it would be.<br /><br />That's not to say the film has the insight of Borat, but it does show Cohen's deft ability to bring pointed, serious issues to light while hiding them under a thin veil of gross out gags, penis humor, and stunning political incorrectness. The firebrand of a closing monologue is a thing of genius, even if the message he's sending is an obvious and disturbing one. But that's getting ahead just a little bit, because there are an incredible amount of laughs to be had before reaching that point. Cohen plays General Aladeen, a hilarious Saddam Hussein knock-off who runs the north African nation of Wadiya with an iron fist. Born into power and demanding of his people's support, he's both vengeful and extremely petty, powered by years of privilege. He has the money to do basically anything he wants, like nail some of the hottest women in Hollywood. You either worship him as the leader or....well, the other option is pretty nasty. When the UN comes calling with claims of Wadiya fostering a nuclear program, Aladeen jets to New York with his security detail to try and head off any possible sanctions. When he arrives, he's naturally floored that our country is as free as it appears, while also noting some of the obvious hypocrisies. Not long after arriving, he's betrayed by his elder brother(Sir Ben Kingsley), who has him kidnapped and replaced by a moronic body double who will sign a UN agreement making Wadiya a true democracy. Why? So that Big Oil execs, all named after their corporate masters, can swoop in and buy up the oil fields for a hefty sum.<br /><br />Presumed dead and shaved of his beard, the symbol of his rightful power, Aladeen is forced to try and acclimate to American culture while finding a way to stop the signing. The dictatorship must be protected at all costs! He becomes reluctant friends with a political activist named Zoey(Anna Faris), a vegan and a woman (*gasp*) who takes him in and gives him a job, even as he insults and demeans her right to her face. In fact, jokes about the perceived inferiority and unworthiness of females are probably the most prevalent of all in this film, although no group is spared Cohen's wrath. For once, we're treated to a spirited comedy that hasn't had all of the best gags ruined by trailers, which is a remarkable feat considering all that we've seen of the movie. Smartly, Cohen has chosen to use his gift for creating spontaneous controversy as a means of hyping the film, such as turning up at the Academy Awards as Aladeen, then promptly spilling ashes all over Ryan Seacrest.<br /><br />Cohen is a master at eliciting uncomfortable laughter from situations we know are just plain wrong! When Aladeen and his reluctant compatriot, a scientist named Nadal(the perfectly cast Jason Mantzoukas), turn up at a funeral for an African-American man with hopes of stealing his epic beard, it's impossible not to hide your face at the racial firestorm that's about to be unleashed. No subject is taboo, and even the 9/11 tragedy is used to clever, comical effect. It's at times like this when Cohen is at his most dangerous, and it seems to sharpen his edge in a way. There's no doubt that many people are going to be turned off by this scene in particular, and it's hard to blame them. It's equally difficult not to respect Cohen's brazenness to go where nobody else would dare to. There are times when the film seems to stretch pretty hard to keep up the steady stream of gags, and it's at times like this when you wish Cohen would depart from the script and just go out and insult some ignorant bystander. Like most of Cohen's creations, Aladeen isn't a character you necessarily root for. He's more like somebody you love to hate. That said, he's as memorable and quotable as Borat was, and certainly less irritating than Bruno.<br /><br />It helps that Cohen gets a ton of support from a fantastic supporting cast, another reason why this film succeeds where some of his improvised efforts haven't.  Mantzoukas is brilliant as Aladeen's accomplice, Nadal, a scientist who the dictator thought he had executed. Nadal is just the right prism from which to view Aladeen's character, a guy who has loyalty to the system Aladeen represents, but also has a good deal of hatred for the man himself. He also knows the true nature of Aladeen's heart, and manipulates him at every turn. Anna Faris is basically relegated to being the focal point for Cohen's verbal jabs(he calls her a \\"lesbian hobbit\\"), and it takes some getting used to seeing her held back in such a way. A number of priceless celebrity cameos also swell the film's ranks, but they are also best left unspoiled. The most surprising scene stealer of all had to be MadTV's Bobby Lee as an ambassador who likes to exert his power in a very special kind of way. Again, something best left for you to discover yourself, but let's just say it involves some very interesting folks doing something unexpected.<br /><br />As Cohen has branched off into more legitimate roles, such as co-starring in Martin Scorsese's Hugo, it's going to be interesting to see if it leads to a softening of his style. For now, The Dictator proves again that nobody is as outrageously offensive as Cohen, and we wouldn't have it any other way. \\"Jachnun\\"!!t dangerous, and it seems to sharpen his edge in a way.

0345803485|1.0|I'm having a hard time understanding why this book is so popular.  It is VERY poorly written, and it is not erotic, it's creepy.  Obviously there was no editor involved, or even someone who took English 101. What I find most disturbing is that so many women like this book.  What does this say about how women think of themselves, individually and as members of our gender?  This sets women back 100 years.  It ended exactly as it should -- I'm going to leave myself with this ending, and try to forget that it is the first in a trilogy.
B005LAIHIQ|2.0|They're creepy and they're kooky, mysterious and...oh, that's another crazy horror TV family. Dark Shadows has managed to achieve some measure of cult status thanks to its quirky, macabre premise, more so than for any claim to being good. It was unique at least, as fairly serious goth soap operas featuring monsters and parallel universes are kinda hard to come by nowadays. You won't have to look hard to find the yearly Dark Shadows Festival, and the show has been attempted as a remake on more than one occasion. They all failed. Let's face it, remaking a series that seems to defy typical genre conventions is a tough act. Since most people have no clue what the heck Dark Shadows was, and a TV series is a proven failure, what's the best way to make use of this niche property? Make a movie out of it.<br /><br />Unfortunately that seems to be the only consideration at play in this tired and disappointing version of Dark Shadows, made even worse by the presence of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, who on paper would seem to be the perfect fit. Over the years, Burton has strayed further away from original material, shutting off much of his creative genius in order to bring to life the vision of others, and this would be the best evidence that all those years away have caused him to lose his touch. The same goes for Depp, who in his eighth collaboration(!!!) with Burton has fallen into the same comfortable formula as him. Burton appears perfectly happy to apply his talents to substandard, franchise friendly material. Depp, who has spent more time playing goofball characters than actual human beings, has reached the point where it looks as if he's not even trying anymore.<br /><br />This Dark Shadows bears many of the hallmarks of the original series, Burton-ized for maximum marketability. That's not to say that making an obviously mainstream film is a bad thing. It's just that what made Burton so special is that he could do it without it ever feeling like he was compromising his artistic vision. Those days, sadly, are gone, traded in for half-hearted love triangles and lazy culture clash jokes sprinkled with spiffy 1970s rock tunes. The film begins promisingly in 1760, where the Collins clan have uprooted themselves and moved to Maine, where they began a thriving seafood company that powers the entire town's economy. They're so beloved that the town actually becomes known as Collinsport, but that's about where all the good cheer ends. Young Barnabas Collins(Depp) has become the object of desire of their servant girl, Angelique(Eva Green), and he has given in to passion with her on numerous occasions, even though he has found true love with the beautiful Josette(Bella Heathcote). When Barnabas tries to break things off with Angelique, she gets revenge by casting a murderous spell on Josette, destroying the Collins family, and cursing Barnabas as a vampire. Oh, and then she has him buried alive.<br /><br />Fast forward a couple of hundred years to 1972, and the Collins family is still feeling the effects of Angelique's curse. The once stately Collins Manor has fallen into disarray, broken and disheveled. The family business is in tatters, with the surviving Angelique using the years to take over the seafood industry for herself, sending the Collins' into ruin. All that remains of the family are a handful of heirs with secrets and quirks galore: the regal matriarch, Elizabeth Collins Stoddard(Michelle Pfeiffer); her insufferable, gold-digging brother(Johnny Lee Miller); the rebellious teenage daughter, Carolyn(Chloe Moretz); and the troubled 10-year old son, David(Gully McGrath). Things begin to turn around with the arrival of Victoria Winters(Heathcote again) as the new governess, who happens to be the spitting image of Josette. When Barnabas is accidentally unearthed from his grave(and promptly slaughters everyone nearby), he rejoins the family and sets out to restore them to their greater glory.<br /><br />Of course it won't be easy, especially when Barnabas quickly falls for Victoria, and she seems drawn mysteriously to him. Like a replay from their youth, Angelique jealously does everything in her power to steal Barnabas away, inciting a rivalry between her and the Collins clan that threatens to consume the town. What could have been a hilarious and spirited war between supernatural foes, mixed with Burton's freakish flair for the dramatic, turns out to be a one-note affair. Much of the humor derives for Barnabas's inability to adapt to modern times, spazzing out over the \\"tiny songstress\\" singing on the television. He's generally lost in the cultural freedom of the time period, although he seems to have the \\"free love\\" ideal down pretty well. Burton, along with horror novelist turned screenwriter Seth Grahame-Smith(Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter), mine the fish out of water humor for all it's worth. They're actually quite funny for awhile, but like most of Depp's impersonations they wear thin really quick. It doesn't help that the rest of the Collins clan are basically ignored, seen only when reacting to some misstep Barnabas has made. Moretz, a fantastic and mature young actress is badly miscast as Carolyn, a vampy bit of jailbait with a snotty attitude and great \\"birthing hips\\". Not even Helena Bonham Carter, such a staple and a highlight of many Burton movies, has much to do here as the family psychiatrist, Dr. Julia Hoffman. The most interesting thing about her, other than the momentary \\"fling\\" she has with the over-sexed Barnabas, is her blazing scarlet hair. Only Eva Green's busty and sinful performance as Angelique has any hint of life to it. She can curse me anytime she wants. We just aren't given much of a reason to care about anybody, and that includes Barnabas.<br /><br />The fundamental problem is the inability to blend the show's campy, soap opera elements with Burton's rather specific sort of black comedy. The tone is all over the map, from dark and rather vicious, to downright silly. Sometimes this can be a good thing, and Burton has shown many times he can usually find a way to make these elements work in perfect harmony. He never pulls it off here, though, and a big part of the problem is Graham-Smith's haphazard writing. Having read both of his popular, genre mash-up novels, that inconsistency is a recurring theme. He's a writer with a lot of cool ideas but little clue how to pull them off. That fits what happens to Dark Shadows to a tee. There's so much potential here, from the concept to the cast, that it's aggravating to sit and watch it go absolutely nowhere. At least it looks like a Burton film. He certainly hasn't lost his touch for art and production design.<br /><br />Burton and Depp have stated in the past how they were huge fans of theTV series, and it's mainly due to them that this film exists. They must've only really enjoyed the occasional episode or two, because it quickly becomes apparent that they have no idea where a Dark Shadows movie should lead. Clocking in at a ponderous 113 minutes, you start to feel every second of it, and the ending indicates the possibility of sequels. Rather than going in that direction, maybe Burton and Depp should just get together and pop in the Blu-Rays for a weekend marathon.ally when Barnabas quickly falls for Victoria, and she seems drawn mysteriously to him.

0345803485|2.0|I'm not sure exactly why I'm adding this review to be buried amongst the thousands, but I gave this book a lot of thought as I read it, so why not?<br /><br />Through most of the book, I considered giving it a 3-star review.  I didn't expect to love it, but found the story kept my interest and flowed well enough.  The end, however, changed my perspective enough to drop it down to 2.  Throughout most of the book, I felt Christian was a manipulator of the first order - sure he had a tough life, and I know the following books (which I will not read) are supposed to address it further.  No, Christian is an abuser, needs very serious help, and Ana should run, not walk, out of his life for good here.<br /><br />And for the record, I knew before I started that while some of the sex acts are BDSM, and I suppose Christian would like to think it's his lifestyle, but in fact it is not.  I suppose it should make the scenes more titillating, but it didn't.  Still, I would have given three...<br /><br />As for the character development up to this point... well, having not read Twilight (though I have read a couple of other Twilight Fanfictions), I now have a perfect understanding of \\"How Twilight Works\\" on \\"The Oatmeal.\\"  Ana is an empty shell who doesn't appreciate who she is or what she has.  Then we are repeatedly reminded of \\"Edward's perfect face,\\" oh sorry, I meant Christian Grey's perfect grey eyes.  They fall madly, instantly in love from the moment Ana falls into his office (even though he doesn't realize it for what it is yet).  He then stalks, overwhelms and seduces her, but that's okay... well until that final scene, apparently.<br /><br />Despite all that, I still was compelled to continue reading. The story did hold my interest, possibly more than that, but in the same sense as watching reality TV or listening to Howard Stern - just to see what's going to happen next.  Hence the almost considered 3-star rating.<br /><br />What bothered me most as I read, at least upuntil the final scene (I may be beating a dead horse here, let's just take that as a given from here on), was the fact that this book, distributed by a subsidiary of Doubleday, really - desperately - needed an editor.<br /><br />Yes, I am going to pick on the grammar, but then I do a fair bit of grammar editing for independent authors.  I could go on about the simple sentence structure and repetitiveness, but I'll go straight for my personal favorite.  Someone needs to learn how to use commas.  I know it's petty, but it really bugs me when a sentence (I wish I'd bookmarked it - it was in the first 15% of the book) not only doesn't make sense because the missing comma makes the sentence say exactly the opposite of what I'm sure the author intended, given the context).  I did bookmark: \\"He smells, clean, fresh, heavenly...\\"<br /><br />On the other hand, I don't claim to be a great content editor, and even cutting some slack for the author not being from the United States, and maybe I can allow that since her children are not (or were not at writing) at University age, she might not realize much about the lives of young adults in 2011.  An editor should have though.<br /><br />I know others have commented, a college student without a computer?  And no email?  And I have to agree.  Personal computers are practically required, and if nothing else, the school would issue an email address, because that's how their primary form of admin-faculty-student communication.<br /><br />Okay, but maybe she couldn't afford $500 for an average Windows laptop at any time during her time at school... But if that's the case, how could she possibly afford to book a flight across the country on the day of travel?  And when she actually does travel, she secretly leaves her Blackberry on, and expects to receive email on it while in flight?  Telephone data plans don't work that way.<br /><br />Similarly, though not on the same level, when she's upset one night after Christian leaves, well after 10, she decides to call her mother in Georgia.  I can deal with that actually, but shouldn't she at least be concerned about it being 2AM in Georgia?  And shouldn't her mother sound like she just woke up?<br /><br />So clearly, there were a lot of things which annoyed me, but I kept reading, I kept thinking I'll be kind and give it 3 stars for exceeding my expectations.  Now I feel generous giving it two.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|I think ice age villige is extremely fun. and its very edicting once you play it you cant get rid of it.it is one of my favorite games.so please download it.its very fun.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love this app. I use it several times a day. Always works great. I wish there were more addition. If I ever lose my tablet those is the forsrY
B007V5CF5K|4.0|great game great price alawar ent. provides you an interesting and fun game for only. 99 helps keep me busy when i cant sleep
0345803493|5.0|Read all 3 books. Loved it! The story itself is beautiful and I love the ending. I know a lot of people talked about the strong sexual contents in the books. Maybe so for book 1, but it's the romance in book 2 and 3 that kept me going and not want to put it down. I just can't wait to see how the two of them end up in the end.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|this game is fun so far; no problems on the kindle fire; but I haven't played very much of it yet. If it continues like this thoughts,  it could be one of my raves!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|All 3 books were brilliant. Great easy reads and a scary and probably correct view of the future of the human race.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is a really funny game. my kid loves it very much. Can u make the Kungfu game more gift?
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I own the first two seasons and I plan on buying the third season soon after it comes out.  The story is painful to watch from week to week or to find things to pass the time during hiatuses, but the series is worth it.  This series has romance, heart-break, adventure, joy, history, and of course, the paranormal.  If you don't like urban-fantasy (fantasy set in present day) you probably won't like this show.<br /><br />If you enjoyed Twilight, you will like this show.  If you hated Twilight (like me) you might still enjoy this show.  I love Anne Rice and these vampires are more Anne Rice than they are Stephanie Meyer.<br /><br />There is a lot of character development in this season, and it doesn't go unnoticed by the audience.  You will find yourself empathizing with would be enemies and crying over lost love (both romantic and platonic).<br /><br />The series does seem to get boring in the middle, but it quickly picks back up and ends an intense edge-of-your-seat finale.  And, yes, in case you were worried the show would be left with a cliff-hanger full of questions, it does.  But, don't let that turn you away.  The series has been renewed a 4th season.<br /><br />It will be good to invest in the DVDs because you will want to watch some episodes over and over.<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br /><br />I own the other DVDs and I adore the bonus content.  The interviews and commentary are great, but I found myself wishing more episodes had commentary.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I think this app is awesome because after a while you blow up zombies with a bow which is awesome
9562913686|5.0|Read everything from Hagin, Copeland, Osteen, etc., etc.  Prayed, suffered, and I could go on and on but when I got a hold of this book, applied what I read along with a written petition of my prayer and did as Mr. Murphy taught - BOOM - within days my over 30 year old prayer happened.  Coincidence?  I really don't think so.  There's more to write later.  An update coming soon........
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Very easy to use and works very smooth on my kindle fire. The reading plans are very easy to use.
0345803507|3.0|So, if you're reading this series expecting literary, tongue dropping prose, forget it.  This is like a Lifetime Movie mini-series.  It is very entertaining, not remotely insightful, and if that's what you're looking for, it's great.  Easy to read, entertainment, and it will keep you wanting to read the next in the series.  Not because you're learning from it or gaining perspectives and intelligence, but because it is like a train wreck, you just have to know what happens.  If this is what you're looking for, you'll love it and keep the pages turning.  If not, don't waste your money.  For me, it served its purpose - an entertaining, simple, at times annoying, story of two bizarro people.  The repitiveness of certain phrases was COMPLETELY annoying -- \\"my inner goddess says\\", \\"my subconscious says\\" -- that was tooooo much. And really, if you're going to have sex three times a day, we don't need details each and every time.  Maybe three times a week give the details.  The sex started to become bland to read about because it was soooooo often!
B007K3KO74|5.0|As always a great addition for Madonna fans.<br />This album is an excellent one and a very good dance record too.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|first, there are lots of negative reviews because people think you cant exit the game which is not true.  you just have to hit the menu Icon labeled &quot;stuff &quot; then &quot;options &quot; and the kindle bar opens.  so that is just user error.  the real problems with the game is that it basically abandons players who a)  don't want to invest real money and b)  don't want to play via social networks.  I thought it would just be a fun standalone game.  I know,  its free,  duh.  free apps all come with a high price tag.  I give it 3 stars just cuz it leaves you hanging with no more goals or rewards once it figures out you wont pay and don't want to share your online activities with a game.
B004A8ZWW4|4.0|Take the story from Rocky, add giant robots, an annoying kid and some rock 'n roll and you'll experience Real Steel.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman used to be a boxer before the sport was outlawed. Now he operates a giant robot in the new boxing ring. Unfortunately, he's a lousy human being. He's fathered a kid but cares nothing for his offspring. His main concern is making money with the bots.<br /><br />When he's called to court for a custody hearing, Jackman makes a deal in order to \\"watch\\" his son for the summer for a large sum of money. (He's the cliched low-life.)<br /><br />During the summer, father and son find and update an old sparring robot in order for it to fight in the arenas. This bot was created to take a beating and in this way is very much the robotic version of the Italian Stallion.<br /><br />The film tries very hard to get you to believe this robot is alive, having it stare into a mirror and shadow box with the boy, but we're lucky in that they kept it lifeless. It's just a robot but people still cringe when the punches are delivered.<br /><br />Young boys will love the boxing robots and the high-octane music while their moms will enjoy seeing Hugh Jackman become a better man.<br /><br />Seriously, Jackman is the reason this movie is so good. He has the ability to take a less than so-so movie and turn it into a fairly successful flick.<br /><br />Outside of the incredibly annoying kid and a few bad examples of foul language, Real Steel is a decent movie.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I really enjoyed the entire trilogy, although my favorite was the first book. I would recommend the Hunger Games as a very good escape into another world for a bit.
0307959856|3.0|What about the gunshots that the coachman heard? The  gun was found in Captain Denny's hand and brought back to Pemberley. As far as I could tell, it was never mentioned again. This was my major problem with the book - although I enjoyed reading it, I had to keep going back to keep track of the plot. So many confessions and explanations! I recommend this book for its attempt to imitate the writing style of Jane Austen, but I warn fans of P.D. James that this is far from her best work.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This Bible is so helpful, and with so many different versions of the Bible it makes reading my Bible a lot easier. I used to have a problem reading my Bible everyday, but thanks to the daily devotionals I read everyday and the devotionals make it easier to comprehend. I would most definitely recommend it to anyone who is even thinking about getting it.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Like most users, I enjoyed this game very much... at first. the game gave an interesting challenge and you were allowed to build your own settlement. The quests gave you something to work for rather than just aimlessly building. The game was good.<br /><br />After about two weeks of playing and building up my town, the inevitable happened ... my battery died while the game was running. No big deal, right? Plug in the Fire, reopen the app, continue where you left off. Wrong. I opened the app to find all my times reset and some drastically elevated to almost two days. Despite being annoyed, I waited it out and continued playing.<br /><br />That problem ended up being only some of the first problems. The game annoyingly runs in the background and constantly glitches the notification bar. If you need to turn off your device, it affects the game and all of your times shoot up. I even patiently reinstalled, was extra careful and have still had problems. Quests restarting, bonuses disappearing and recently my game uninstalled the mandatory hard drive information completely resetting my villiage.<br /><br />I'm fed up. This is not worth my time and energy. Uninstalled. Do not reccommend.
B003F3PMYI|1.0|I feel bad being so negative about a book on positive psychology, but I really had a hard time with this book. First, The Happiness Advantage should have been at least half as long as it was. The first third of the book was devoted to the author \\"selling\\" the book to me (I'm already reading it-- I'm game!) and much of the content was extremely redundant. Overall, there were far too many self-indulgent, dull or tangential anecdotes for my taste. I liked a few of the strategies the author presented, but I felt like I could have gotten the same benefit from reading an academic article about the topic. Overall, there are many books on implementing positive psychology in one's work, like those by Kim Cameron, which I would recommend instead of this one.
B004F3N48I|5.0|The Kindle Fire works great with these shows! No problems at all so far. Looks great, sounds great. I love it! The show is great. Love me some vampires!
B00008S2VG|1.0|(Having listened to this CD MAKES me write!)<br /><br />Tsk, tsk.  For me, not even worth the plastic it's on, I'm afraid.  In other words, the plastic in this CD is more valuable than the music, to me.  Regrettable and unfortunate.  Why did Madge think I wanted to hear this material?  Of course, the record company has to bow to her wishes, but even Goodwill won't take this CD to resell it.  Wait!  Goodwill can't sell it, but Warner Brothers must?  I have to think about that!  (I'm glad I didn't buy my copy retail -- mine was a used copy resold via eBay.  So no further profits to Madge.)  The lyrics are inane; the music is tuneless; the creativity is nonexistent.<br /><br />Madge:  I want positive, fun, creative, interesting, inspiring work from you -- not this pap.  Even the artwork and packaging are despondent and negating.  Ugly.  I realize that you feel you hit the mark -- but not my mark -- I who make the choice to buy your product.<br /><br />By the way -- Can't you leave Jesus Christ out of your musings?  He doesn't deserve your comments.  No, you are not as special as He -- if I am hearing your lyrics correctly.  You are special in His eyes; I am special in His eyes -- but you seem to be equating yourself to Him.  (You wanted me to hear your lyrics, so you'll have to read my comments.)<br /><br />Audience:  On the very positive side -- I will say that you'd enjoy Madge's \\"Music\\" album.  But stay away from this one --  I was actually looking forward to more interesting work from Mirwais - but I'm afraid it's not to be found here.  This album is not even for die-hard Madge collectors.<br /><br />There is ONE redeeming factor:  \\"Die Another Day\\" is absolutely brilliant.  Find the long version of this song.  Genius.  That's what interested me in Madge's and Mirwais' work --  but it's not to be found on the rest of \\"American Life.\\"  (While I'm here, \\"MDNA\\" is also regrettably going on to Goodwill.  Maybe they can resell it?)<br /><br />I'd give this CD zero stars, but Amazon won't allow a rating that low.  They should.  Madge:  You can do better.<br /><br />Want to hear a great singer with great music?  Check out Sandi Patty.
B005OAMYVO|5.0|I am a fan of Tony Bennett from way back. I had to have this CD because it contains two bonus tracks. Tony singing Duets with Jackie Evancho, who by the way will be in concert with Tony Bennett Aug 31, 2012 at Ironstone Amphitheatre in Murphys, CA. A concert I am looking forward to....Tony Bennett and Jackie Evancho...WOW !!! It doesn't get any better that that...This is a RARE CD. You have to look around for it. It was a TARGET Stores exclusive.
B007NESBK2|5.0|I saw this tour in Houston and as a veteran of over 100 concerts ranging from country to heavy metal...this one tops them all (and I have seen some legends in their prime). Sade is nothing short of mesmerizing and if this DVD lives up to the show I saw (and it should), then stop what you're doing and order this now.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I mostly enjoyed this book because it made me get in touch with my 20s again. Not that my 20s were anywhere near as exciting at Ana's... If you are looking to heat up your current relationship and lose yourself in a modern-day romance this is your book. I will say it probably isn't for everyone, but it was definitively for me.
B007V2UGPE|1.0|had to restart device and uninstall app. anyone else have this problem? needs way too many permissions anyway. too bad.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game can go on and on. I wish there we're more games like this on &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;I also Love the mini game and little movie with the cute little scrat!
B0079R8KO0|5.0|Super pleased with this case. Easy to install, it looks great and it feels great to hold. The \\"stand\\" function is a really nice feature as well. No complaints with this one. I would recommend this case to anyone with a Fire.

B004MC8CA2|3.0|It is wonderful to have this Bible app wherever I go. Very portable and I don't need wi-fi. The app has different versions of the Bible for easy reading.
B0040JHL6S|5.0|I don't like to think of myself as \\"stuck in my ways,\\" but when I find a shoe that works, I keep going back. So it is with the Brooks Adrenaline. It works for me, as have the last however many pairs I've gone through. I always pour over as many reviews as I can find, and eventually simply go with the shoe that fits me better than any other. If you've worn and enjoyed the Adrenaline before, you shouldn't be tremendously surprised with this next generation. It fits well. It may require a little break-in. In other words, just what you'd expect from any quality shoe. Feet being subjective things, I can't tell you this is the best shoe for you. But I can say they have consistently been the best for me. Medium-weight, short-distance runner, long-distance run/walker.

0345803485|1.0|After the literary porn I read as a 14 year old, I didn't think the sex scenes in \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" would bother me, but alas I'll never know because I didn't get to them! I was bored stiff by the sample chapters. Nothing happened. Nothing. Maybe if I was in solitary confinement and I had absolutely nothing else to read...
B00005N6KG|5.0|I love these. I'm a professional transcriptionist and I just bought 4 more of them! Highly recommended for transcription, and I also listen to music on them. I think they're great.
0345529057|5.0|I was unbelievably happy about this purchase! The books were never read and in pristine condition. They were packaged incredibly well. I don't even buy books anymore from anywhere but Amazon. I am always pleased with the books I receive for an amazing price.
B007Q2N0HA|4.0|This book has been compared to 50 Shades but is better written and certainly better edited. Looking forward to book #2
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I am an avid reader.  When I heard all the buzz about this book, and when my friends urged me to read it, I went for it.  I am so disappointed.  While the story may be \\"fun\\" for some to fantasize about, the book is very poorly written.  The author's literary style is basically nonexistent. I couldn't wait for it to be over, and I will not be reading books 2 and 3. Buyer beware: the book is not all it is hyped up to be!
B0052VUNHC|1.0|Ladies-please warn your daughters that a man like Travis is not cool and brings nothing but heartache and trouble. Also, marriage at such a young age is never the answer. This book is a disaster--just not a beautiful one.

1400168171|3.0|Victor Wooten is an amazing bass player. I have had the pleasure of seeing him<br />play live with Bela Fleck and the Flecktones.<br /><br />I really enjoy listening to Victor play instrumental pieces on his bass. I have some of<br />his solo material as well.<br /><br />As for The Lesson, if you are into New Age thought, then you will enjoy this book to its<br />fullest. If you are not into New Age thought, then you will not enjoy many of the chapters<br />that focus on that topic. That said, I found some of the chapters to be quite fun.<br /><br />I didn't purchase this book with the thought of learning bass insights but to get a glimpse<br />of Victor's thoughts about learning. That said, the book did inspire a few new thoughts about playing bass.<br /><br />Pretty much all the bass-related topics mentioned in this book are covered in the Groove Workshop DVD ([[ASIN:B001DPC4I2 Victor Wooten: Groove Workshop]])<br /> (which by the way includes exercises and teaches those insights in a straight forward way, not as story and without<br />the New Age spin). I highly recommend his Groove Workshop DVD no matter what you bass skill level may be.<br /><br />I did find that a few of the topics in the book were mentioned with a different example or approach which complimented<br />the same topic that was demonstrated in the Groove Workshop.<br /><br />The Amazon product page was mislabeled.<br />From the product description ('Audio CD') I thought I was buying an audio CD that could be played in a CD player.<br />What was delivered was a data CD that had MP3 files (which will not play in a regular CD player, or at least<br />none that I own). It worked out in the end since I put the MP3 files on my [[ASIN:B003Q6CUD0 COWON J3 32 GB Portable Media Player (Black)]] (which I would also<br />recommend) and listened to it from there.<br /><br />The data CD version of The Lesson included the 'The Lesson' song from Victor's album [[ASIN:B00132D86M Palmystery]].<br /><br />If you can only buy either the Groove Workshop or The Lesson, I would say go with the Groove Workshop.
B001GCUER0|5.0|It's an New York era captured in style and in substance. It's no wonder the Emmy Awards just pour in.

0393088774|4.0|Paul Krugman's new book, End this Depression Now, paints the reality of Depression II with the colors of truth and the promise of a solution. Anyone concerned about current politics, jobs and our future, no matter the political persuasion, had better read this one. A Nobel Prize winner in Economics, Paul knows whereof he speaks ---a must read.<br /><br />Dr. Krugman makes clear that indeed we are in a depression. He defines our present circumstances as a liquidity trap in which the majority of the population cuts back on spending in order to reduce debt. Businesses do the same; they lay off workers and build up a reserve. Banks too deleverage to ride out the storm, but get right back into the shadow-banking, derivatives and chinagins that helped get us into this mess. (J.P. Morgan just lost two billion through misdirected dark derivative trading.) Consumers will not borrow even at zero percent and interest rates can't go much lower than that. Like Japan for a decade, we cannot grow out of the liquidity trap.<br /><br />Krugman goes to great lengths to describe the polarization of economists in their conflicting understanding or misunderstanding of the causes and solutions to our dilemma. Economists apparently understood the causes of the Great Depression, and legislators as well enacted regulations and safeguards to prevent it happening again. Since the 1980s, however, legislators supported newer, more fashionable and erroneous economic beliefs, systematically repealing those earlier safeguards. I like Krugman's description of current economists as: salt water economists versus freshwater economists. Those may be euphemisms for Democrats and Republicans. In any case Salt Water Economists appear to be the good guys.<br /><br />Quoting from the book, \\"Yet Lucas, a Nobel laureate who was a towering, almost dominate figure in macroeconomics for much of the 1970s and 1980s, wasn't wrong in saying that economists had learned a lot since the 1930s. By, say, 1970 the economics profession really did know enough to prevent a recurrence of anything resembling the Great Depression. --- And then much of the profession proceeded to forget what it had learned.\\" Krugman goes on to explain, \\"How a mix of politics and runaway academic sociology, through which basically absurd notions, became dogma in analysis of both finance and macroeconomics.\\"<br /><br />I love the phrase, \\"runaway academic sociology.\\" I take it as a foreshadowing of the trade deficit and the funneling of middle class wealth into the hands of the wealthy. I call it a money pump that drained wealth from the Middle Class, first to our trading partners and then back in the form of foreign investment into the hands of the nouveau riche plutocracy that so benefited from this flow of wealth, the 1% and the 0.01%. I thought - and I was mistaken - that Krugman would define academic-sociology as the near messianic belief that unregulated trade could do no wrong.<br /><br />Krugman makes a compelling case for using the tools that we still have to end this depression. He argues soundly that the stimulus package did not go far enough. His suggestions listed first of all government-spending as the essential ingredient for getting us out of the liquidity trap.  The list includes areas of immediate impact like funding states and local governments at such a level as to meet the need for projected but canceled spending on critical local measures -- such as teachers. The list further includes spending on critical infrastructure, not exotics, but things like the electric grid, rail-bed upgrades, roads, bridges and so forth. Interestingly, Krugman shows that a measured degree of inflation at around 4% could further stimulate production reduce the cost of debt and allow for a real interest rate below 0%. (The real cost of money must include inflation) Furthermore, Krugman establishes, at least to my satisfaction that inflation will not come roaring back. He additionally favors more and extended relief for those who struggle, and he further proposes mortgage payment relief through refinancing. He also mentioned the need to push China to follow the rules about the value of its currency.<br /><br />Krugman attributes the depression to the systematic dismantling of the banking rules which had been designed to prevent the depression from recurring and the aggressive behavior of banks and other businesses as a result of loosening those safeguards.<br /><br />I did not find any description of the role that the trade deficit did or did not play in this crisis. Last month's deficit in the balance-of-trade came in at over fifty billion dollars. The trade deficit just keeps growing -- and for many decades now. I do not know how you can explain the depression without acknowledging the not so slow drain on the US consumer from jobs, manufacturing and sales revenue going overseas. I do not see in Krugman's book, the big money flow that makes the 1 - 0.1% so wealthy and the middle class so poor. We all know that for generations now our wives have had to work. We also know the struggle to pay college tuition for our children, many if not most families deferring to college loans - but that's another story. Politically incorrect as it may be, the trade deficit looms as the unmentioned elephant in the livingroom. Six hundred billion a year amounts to over 4% of the GDP. Anyway we look at it that's a drain. Furthermore most of it returns in the form of foreign investment seeking a safe haven. It must keep hedge fund managers staying up at night thinking up investment instruments to sop up that transferred wealth. I don't see numbers equating the loss to the middle class by service jobs transfered overseas, or the loss of local jobs as a result of manufacturing overseas.<br /><br />American companies' overseas profits remain overseas because of high corporate tax rates. Furthermore, domestic corporations reduce their tax burden by paying upper management inflated salaries. The executives manage tax shelters by their own means, thus paying less tax than the average middleclass consumer. So, the Middle Class not only unwittingly transfers wealth to the wealthy, but pays their share of the taxes on it as well.<br />Let's end this trade deficit now and end the money pump. Daddy Warbucks will scream his head off and pay a fortune in PR convincing the public that you can't do that. He is laughing all the way to the bank - he is the bank. Krugman's book stimulates these thoughts and questions in my mind. I hope more of the American public will ask these questions as well.<br /><br />My economics was at Kansas. Not being too clear on Keynesian economics, I looked up my college professor's opinion of Keynesian theory. In John Ise's introduction to his 1950 text, Economics, He writes, \\"Although I do not regard Keynesian doctrine as the whole of the `new economics,` I have injected Keynesian theory at various points in the book, as well as in the new chapter.\\"<br /><br />Apparently, not all fresh water economists were anti  Keynes, or was Kansas the exception with no water, just sod and wheat?elief for those who struggle, and he further proposes mortgage payment relief through refinancing. He also mentioned the need to push China to follow the rules about the value of its currency.<br /><br />Krugman attributes the depression to the systematic dismantling of the banking rules which had been designed to prevent the depression from recurring and the aggressive behavior of banks and other businesses as a result of loosening those safeguards.<br /><br />I did not find any description of the role that the trade deficit did or did not play in this crisis.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have always been a fan of post-apocalyptic novels, so a few days ago I decided to download a few books to my Kindle since I had run out of things to read. My God was this series an awesome choice. I bought the book on May 5th, began reading it on the 7th, and did not stop reading it for the next five days. When I wasn't at work or eating (and sometimes when I was at work or eating) I was reading Wool. I simply could not put it down. My Kindle Fire's battery was the bane of my existence during these times, and it kept alerting me to low battery because I could not put it down.<br /><br />The author's writing style is excellent, and the way that the books are structured kept me going. I love how the books flip between different characters, how they all tie together, and how what seems like a simple story at the beginning creates such an elegant backdrop for the whole series. The grim future that is portrayed is one that could indeed be our own, and it's that realism that kept my eyes glued to the page (well, screen, I guess). The series is gritty, well-written, with enough plot twists and turns to keep me hooked. Hugh, my eyes hurt from staring at my screen for so much time. Also, my girlfriend and cat are upset with me over my addiction to these books.<br /><br />These books were absolutely amazing, and I will be recommending them to everyone I know.

159562015X|5.0|I have three years' experience with Strengths and have taken classes from Gallup; I've also presented at four conferences on using Strengths in college courses. Is it consistent? I've taken the assessment three times; four of five have stayed consistent every time, and the one that changed probably went to six (in other words, just out of sight of the top-five number). Knowing my strengths has changed my life, and that of my students. Knowing your top-five usually puts a seal of approval on the work you're doing. I'm an English instructor, and I have ideation, intellection, learner, strategic, activator, input, and maximizer. Perfect! (Gallup tells you the order of all 34 strengths after you take some of their advanced classes. This has been helpful as well.) Knowing my students' strengths helps me know how to approach them, motivate them, and reminds me not to underestimate them. An apathetic-looking student might have \\"achiever\\" and just not know how to use it yet. Maybe he/she uses it in the videogame world, but doesn't think there's a good application of it in real life. \\"Adaptability\\" people need frequent change in their tasks. \\"WOO\\" students want you to enjoy their charm, and will work harder if you do. Learners are naturals in the classroom. \\"Harmony\\" people hate conflict. \\"Restorative\\" people will learn well with problem-solving activities. Etc. The strengths tools have reinvigorated my teaching approach. They've also given my husband and me great insight into how different we are, and why it's so important to give each other space to be who we are. So, it's beneficial at many levels. In other words: This is a valuable tool. Find out your top-five, but then dig in more deeply, so that you get a real understanding of what the results mean.

B002SEQ8ZC|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie, but I am disappointed with the 3D.<br /><br />This gift set does NOT come with a Blu-Ray 3D movie; it comes with a Blu-Ray that uses Anaglyphic 3D. Some reviews rave about the 3D of this movie, but they must have had a different set because this only come with the Anaglyphic kind of 3D (with the colored glasses), not the Stereoscopic kind. I searched to try and find a definitive answer as to what kind of 3D came in this set and found very little information, so I decided to order it and give it a shot. If you are looking for a REAL 3D Blu-Ray movie, this gift set is not for you.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|It worked very well on my computer.  Made me want to own a better quality screen.  As far as the content goes, I couldn't wait for the DVD to come out as I had planned.  (I saw season one on Netflix)  This is an excellent show.  Beautiful use of the camera, lots of long uncut moving shots (forget what the name for that is)  Costumes, Characters--the actors are all amazing.  One of the best serials I've seen in a long time.  It 's a lot of fun.

B007MDB71O|5.0|1977 was a transformative year in my life.  It started with the discovery of my first \\"Conan the Barbarian\\" comic book at the Eckerd drug store near my house.  Little did I know at the time that I had just crossed the threshold into a whole new world of endless wonders.  This discovery soon led me to the \\"John Carter: Warlord of Mars\\" comic that Marvel was publishing at the time, and in a short couple of months I was immersed in the amazing artwork of Frank Frazetta, as well as the original pulp stories and novels by authors like Robert E. Howard, and of course, Edgar Rice Burroughs.  1977 also marked the premiere of a little known film at the time called \\"Star Wars\\".  I have often said over the last 35 years that the first time I saw \\"Star Wars\\" was the single best time I've ever had at the movies, and while there have certainly been a lot of great films in the last three decades, I was convinced that movies simply didn't have the power to make me feel like that again.  I was wrong.  \\"John Carter\\" managed to do what I thought was impossible: make me feel like that wide-eyed 11 year old kid again.  It goes without saying that I've been waiting for this film for 35 years, but it was worth the wait.  \\"John Carter\\" exceeded - no, shattered - my expectations.<br /><br />The original \\"Princess of Mars\\" is one of my favorite novels of all time.  I've read it so many times over the last three decades that I've lost count, and while some Edgar Rice Burroughs fans were disappointed or even outraged at the deviations from the original source material, in my humble opinion the changes were in most of not all cases justified.  Bob Clampett, the first person who tried to get a John Carter film off the ground in the 1930s, said this about his meetings with Burroughs: \\"Edgar was smart enough to understand that one couldn't just literally translate his Mars books page by page into animation; it just would not be cinematic. So, he gave me a great deal of freedom to dream up and be inspired by his writing and develop a cartoon story on my own.\\"  While ERB was a tremendously gifted author, his works aren't without flaws, and they're a bit dated; there's very little moral ambiguity, he often recycles his own plot twists, and his plots often rely on coincidence.  Additionally, ERB's heroes tend to be sort of Mary Sue characters with no visible physical or moral flaws. I can't see how John Carter or Ulysses Paxton or Cathoris or Gahan would behave differently in the similar circumstances.  So I can see why Stanton chose to give John Carter some personal angst and some character development in order to sell him to modern audiences.  Some have argued that Stanton's changes have rendered a character unrecognizable to fans of the original novels, but I would ask them \\"what characteristics define John Carter as a character?\\"  There's the physical characteristics: black hair (though it's closely cropped in the original novels...no biggie), heightened strength and agility, fairly tall, good looking, in excellent physical health, and agelessness. Although the last characteristic was not overtly stated in the film, it was highly suggested, if people pay attention to the subtle clues in the film. How could Carter, a man who appears to be about the age of thirty (as in the novel) possibly have been able to hold ERB on his knee when ERB was a child and tell him about his wild adventures all over the world? Was Carter doing this as a teenager? And then there's the fact that Carter doesn't age at all during the ten bitter years exiled back on Earth, when the effects wizards could easily have accomplished this with some rudimentary makeup effects.<br /><br />Then there's Carter's personality: Fearless, willing to throw himself in harm's way against impossible odds; selfless, willing to lay down his life for others; Carter behaves consistent with these characteristics throughout the film, even while he's giving lip service to \\"only caring about his cave of gold\\".He rescues Powell from the Apaches when he could have just left him to die; when he sees the air battle between Zodanga and Helium, he expresses his innate sense of justice and fairness with the remark \\"That don't look like a fair fight!\\" and then he throws himself into the thick of the battle when he spots Dejah (whom he doesn't even know) in imminent danger.<br /><br />Some argue that the dead wife and child back-story and Carter's initial reluctance to get involved transform Carter into a character unrecognizable to ERB fans, but I disagree.  I saw a character onscreen that was TRYING not to be noble and selfless because of a personal loss, but was failing at it, and I think the dichotomy enriched the story and drove home the values that were important to Burroughs.  This point is driven home by Dejah Thoris, who sees through the wall he's built around himself. My favorite line of the film: \\"We may be worlds apart, but I know you, John Carter. From the moment you caught me out of the sky, I knew. I felt the heart of a man willing to lay down his life for others\\". That fits ERB's character to a tee.  Without the back-story, that line would not have worked.<br /><br />...which brings us to the character changes to Dejah Thoris.  The main difference is the fact that this Dejah Thoris can actually fight, but I can't believe in this post Princess Leia, post Sarah Conner, post Ripley world that either ERB fans or film fans in general were expecting anything less, or would accept a Dejah Thoris who is physically helpless. This concept was outdated even in the late seventies when Marv Wolfman and Chris Clairemont were penning the \\"John Carter: Warlord of Mars\\" comics, and even then, having read the original novels during the same time period, I welcomed this enhancement. One has to remember that when \\"A Princess of Mars\\" was written in the early 20th Century, women were supposed to be prim and proper at all times, and \\"respectable\\" women rarely even worked out of the home. They didn't even have the right to vote. A woman who was basically helpless to the whims of the man who controlled her (either her father or husband) was the norm rather than the exception. Such outdated conventions would never work in a modern film, unless it was a period piece specifically made to highlight such inequality.<br /><br />The Therns are much more powerful in the film than in the original novels. But the Therns in Burroughs' novels are actually pretty weak when their secrets are exposed, and ERB never really went anywhere with them, other than to have their leader kidnap Dejah Thoris and flee from John Carter (continuously). Burroughs' original concept is compelling, but I think for the sake of drama one must make the \\"bad guys\\" much more powerful than the good guys so that they have a near insurmountable task to overcome. How are the Therns similar to ERBs? They're using a false religion as a global scam to exploit the entire civilization and keep themselves in power, so the subtext is pretty similar.<br /><br />Zodanga isn't even mentioned in \\"A Princess of Mars\\" until the last 5th of it, and this simply wouldn't work in a feature film.  But Burroughs original pro-environmental message remains intact.  Barsoom is a dying planet, its oceans have long since dried up, and Zodanga is selfishly consuming the lion's share of the dwindling resources and making war on its neighbors rather than cooperating with them to find a solution. It was Stanton and Chabon's way of making the theme contemporary while still acknowledging the original source material.<br /><br />In summary, I think that overall the film is a much more balanced and coherent narrative than the novel it's based on, and it's remarkably true to the spirit of it, certainly truer than any other ERB adaptation in the last century.  And the pacing and scope of the film, as well as Michael Giacchino's magnificent score (that simultaneously manages to channel both John Williams and Basil Poledouris at their best - seriously, this is one of the best soundtracks of all time) bring to mind the classic films of the 70s and 80's, the kinds of films they don't make anymore but you wish they did, like \\"Star Wars\\" and \\"Superman\\" and \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\".  I loved all the actors in their respective roles, and thought Taylor Kitsch was near perfect as John Carter, but the real gem in this film is Lynn Collins' performance as Dejah Thoris. I was initially skeptical when I found out she had been cast as \\"the most beautiful woman on two worlds\\", but she OWNED the role, both physically and performance wise.  She IS Dejah Thoris.<br /><br />I simply can't recommend this film enough.  After my first viewing, I was numb; on my second, I soaked in and savored every frame of it.  On the third and subsequent viewings, I literally wept at how good it was. The only thing preventing this film from being considered a classic is the fact that not enough people have seen it yet, but that situation will change.  Mark my words: like \\"Blade Runner\\" and other films that initially met with a cool reception, the decades are going to be kind to \\"John Carter\\".

0345803485|1.0|I love dirty books. I love cheap, $2 Kindle books by unknown authors that write books with very little story and a whole lot of porn. I like good books too, but my point is that I appreciate dirty books for what they are and I have very realistic standards when it comes to the quality of plot, writing and style. I have hundreds of cheapo and freebie Amazon Kindle books about women having threesomes with cowboys, affairs with their bosses, and dudes who turn into wolves.<br /><br />That being said, this is the worst book I have read in many years. There is no style to it at all, and the writing is extremely poor. The heroine, who's name is laughably Anastasia Steele, was so annoying that I could not make it through half the book. It was only curiosity as to how this book became popular that got me past the first chapter. 'Ana' reads like an annoying teenager. She first meets Christian Grey while interviewing him for a college newspaper, and when he politely explains that his secret to success is understanding his employees and rewarding them well, her response is \\"So, you're a control freak.\\" When he replies that he does not see it that way, and that he feels he has a responsibility to 40,000 employees to do his job well and manage his company, her response is to be disgusted. WTF? So, now you've met Ana. That sets the tone for the rest of the book. A spoiled, whining, childish, clumsy, rude, ill mannered little girl. I cannot imagine anyone finding that sexy.<br /><br />How did this book become so popular? I want to know because I write myself and would love to know how such an awful book went viral so well. I can only guess that the book might have been released near April Fool's Day and it's success is a hoax. Perhaps someone in publishing wanted to make a bet- how bad can a book be and still get five star reviews? Twilight is bad, but at least it's for teenagers so I kind of expect it to not be top shelf. But this book? This book makes Stephanie Meyers look like Tolstoy.Tolstoy.

0439023513|5.0|This was my favorite in the trilogy, because it deals with more darker and emotional elements. Albeit, it starts off somewhat slow, with the introduction of District 13. However, when Peeta returns, it picks up again and never slows down. I absolutely adored the epilogue as well. It was a nice conclusion. I do wish Collins explained more about what happens after the rebellion and how Peeta and Katniss grow back together, but I guess that leaves the door open for more potential books? I hope. Excellent series!<br /><br />Also, I wish Collins never would've classified this as a young adult series. It is most definitely NOT for kids, but for older teens and adults. Even though this series is ABOUT kids, it is NOT for them. But it might be good for some, to have that understanding of more severe issues and emotions, rather than the sparkly crap of other series like Twilight.<br /><br />\\"Real or not real?\\"  \\"Real.\\"  This series WAS!

B006P0FIB0|4.0|Okay, so maybe this film isn't 100% faithful to the original novel. So what?!? And maybe the acting isn't that great. So what?!<br /><br />This movie has incredible special effects and action. It's a wonderful twist on a classic tale that stays much more truthful to the novel than \\"The Musketeer\\" with Justin Chambers from the year 2000. Also, this was filmed in 3D so the 3D effects are amazing!<br /><br />Definitely worth the purchase.
B0063IH60K|4.0|enjoyable, fun, relaxing . I find myself playing it more and more. better than playing it on my desktop and laptop. I like the action with the touchpad.

Other than that buy, consume, enjoy and thank me later.
B0070Z97LG|3.0|Not dissimilar to Scorsese's \\"Shutter Island\\" (not dissimilar enough) \\"Dream House\\" is a fascinating thriller that was botched by the marketing heads of Hollywood.  It starts out with some promise as we see Will (Daniel Craig) leaving his job with a full severance package, and then going home to his wife and kids.  It turns out that he may be someone else and his neighbor Ann (Naomi Watts, always magnificent) seems  to hold the key to the strange enigma his consciousness has become. Things get strange from there bigtime, but if you've seen the trailer, this product of the creative imagination (a twist in a twist in a twist) is going to feel a little labored. To be fair, there were some great moments and at times ambiance of the movie reminds me of Cronenberg's film [[ASIN:B00000F4MA Spider]].  If you've seen the trailer, this product of the creative imagination (a twist in a twist in a twist) is going to feel a little labored.  Why would any studio want to lose money on a film that provides some trippy entertainment for a Sunday afternoon by revealing some of the most important elements of the film in the trailer? A highly recommended *rental*.
0307477479|5.0|I waited to pick a copy of this book up until it went on sale for a dollar at my local library because while I have read a couple other of Egan's books and think she can write well I always felt like her stories fell apart and the plots were not the best.  Perhaps that's why I ended up really loving this book.  It is a novel composed of chapters, each focusing on a different character's story even as the other characters play secondary roles.  So, basically, it is a story composed of many smaller stories.  Sounds like something I would hate, but in this book it somehow works beautifully.<br /><br />Among other things this book deals with the idea of time and its role in our lives, growing older, lives not ending up the way you expected nor wanted and trying to turn your life around and second chances and pauses, nostalgia,death and music. They were all relevent to me.  The ending manages to be poignant without being sappy.  I was sorry when I came to the end of this book and it will be one of the rare ones that I reread.

B004T6A3SK|5.0|Reviewed at Another Look Book Reviews<br /><br />I ventured forth with a re-read of Drums of Autumn because I had just finished doing a re-read Voyager. I honestly didn't plan for a re-read of the Outlander series right now but I sorta just fell into it after reading and reviewing The Scottish Prisoner. I am so glad I did.<br /><br />I remember that when I read Drums of Autumn the first and second time, I did enjoy it but because I was so anxious to read anything and everything about Jamie and Claire, I'd skip through a lot of Roger and Bree story lines. This time around I didn't. I just sat back and really took my time and thoroughly enjoyed every chapter and every character. It was fabulous. I feel like I have now just experienced Roger and Bree on a different level.<br /><br />I do remember being so pleased that when Diana Gabaldon wrote Bree, that she didn't just do a carbon copy of Jamie and Claire. Yes she had Jamie's looks and some of his mannerisms but Bree is definitely her own person. I also have to remember that she is young and she will make mistakes that young people will make. I found I appreciated that trait of hers more this time and I was way more forgiving in some of the things she did and how she did them.<br /><br />Drums of Autumn is quite fabulous. So much happens in this book but not in an angsty, heart palpating way. A lot of character growth and the story moved forward by leaps and bounds. I think back to all the scenes that happened in Drums of Autumn and I am blown away by how much time had passed.<br /><br />Claire delivered some of my favourite lines in Drums of Autumn.<br /><br />\\"You're a walking inducement to harlots,\\" I said. \\"Stick by me; I'll protect you.\\"<br /><br />\\"He's much sneakier than I thought,\\" I said. \\"Practically Scottish.\\"<br /><br />\\"Actually, it's your kilt that make me want to fling you to the floor and commit ravishment,\\" I told him.<br /><br />\\"May the Lord deliver me from stubborn Scotsmen!\\" I said.<br /><br />And a Jamie quote worth noting....<br />\\"Your face is my heart, Sassenach,\\" he said softly, \\"and love of you is my soul.\\"<br /><br />The building of Fraser Ridge really provided an excellent foundation for the North Carolina setting and a true appreciation of what the first settlers encountered.<br /><br />If reading Voyager was about Jamie and Claire's reunion, then Drums of Autumn was about Jamie meeting his daughter, Bree. The anticipated scene was fabulous and I wouldn't change a thing. Without a doubt, that encounter was my favourite scene in the entire book. Followed closely by birth of Jemmy. I adore that the birth was a wee bit of a family event.<br /><br />I also found that I enjoyed more of the Indian interactions this time around. I was still very impacted and my heart was heavy for Ian. I found Ian was on my mind a lot and I was ever so thankful that Diana Gabaldon included that letter from Ian to Jamie and Claire while they were attending the Gathering.<br /><br />Of course I need to move on to The Fiery Cross now. I am quite excited about it since that book was my least favourite of the series and now I am thinking after this experience, I will enjoy it that much more.<br /><br />Do you ever go back and re-read a book and just love it even more than you did before?<br /><br />Teasers: Stephen Bonnet the pirate, bear attach and fought off with a fish, Bree's engagement to Lord John, birth of Jemmy and the biological puzzle that goes along with hima Jamie quote worth noting....<br />\\"Your face is my heart, Sassenach,\\" he said softly, \\"and love of you is my soul.\\"<br /><br />The building of Fraser Ridge really provided an excellent foundation for the North Carolina setting and a true appreciation of what the first settlers encountered.<br /><br />If reading Voyager was about Jamie and Claire's reunion, then Drums of Autumn was about Jamie meeting his daughter, Bree.

This collection is a bit pricey, but it is likely to please anyone who is a die-hard Beach Boys fan.

B007R6UYBK|5.0|Case Histories is an engrossing drama. Jackson Brodie (Jason Isaacs) is a former police officer now on his own as a private detective. While the story unfolds through the structure of a detective story, it is anything but. It is a character-driven drama with a complex character -- Jackson Brodie-- at its center. Intelligent writing, character-driven plot within the detective frame -- it's great. I keep watching for when more are coming! Bring them on, please!!!

Howard's 1930s novels, to the Marvel Comics interpretations, the two 1980s films, the short-lived 1990s TV series and even the 1994 TV animated series. This 2011 film, however, is one of the very worst adaptations of any classic super-hero character ever! It's nothing but a montage of fast-paced fight scenes strung together by the thinnest possible pretense of acting, plot and dialogue. I am no purest looking to see my childhood (and adulthood) fantasies presented exactly as I remember then from long ago. I'm fine will all versions of the Conan epic that have exercised considerable license with Howard's original. But this movie is just plain bad on every level. It is an insult to anyone with the vaguest glimmer of intelligence.<br /><br />I fell especially strong about this because I am such a fan of this film genre. So long as those of us who enjoy these kinds of movies pay good money to see films that insults the characters and stories we grew up on, and which insults us on the assumption that we'll accept trash like this just so long as it can be connected to memories and enjoyments we still value, our old heroes will continue to be treated like the cheap raw material for a fast buck by talentless movie-makers literally banking on our gullibility. I strongly urge anyone with any fond connections to the Conan legacies please not pay a penny to encourage this type of hack-job.
B004E0Z4XK|4.0|In 2011, Danger Mouse and Daniele Luppi created an album titled Rome. I purchased this album because I am a huge fan of Danger Mouse's production. Everyone he has produced for (Cee-Lo, MF Doom, Black Keys, Norah Jones, etc.) has had brought a mellow type vibe to those artists, a style of music that I love so much. Here on Rome is no different. His production style complements the guests vocals with no problem whatsoever.<br /><br />As a few other reviewers had stated, Rome has more of a theatrical/western style setting here. Jack White of the White Stripes and Norah Jones vocals are added all over the album. Overall their help is great, especially Jack White's vocals on \\"The Rose With The Broken Neck\\". Norah Jones shines on a few songs such as \\"Black\\" as well. Regardless, the stars on this album are both Danger Mouse and Daniele Luppi with their production.<br /><br />Theres not much way to put it here. This album took over 5 years to make and the ending product is great. This is one of those albums that you can close your eyes and let it take you places. Everyone who was apart of this album (to include the musicians that Luppi conducted) did their part to make this album what it is. This is highly recommended if you never heard of these guys and you are looking for something new to listen to. Peace.<br /><br />Lyrics: N/A<br />Production: A-<br />Guest Appearances: A-<br />Musical Vibes: A-
B003F1WM2K|1.0|I give this book rave reviews, however the kindle version leaves out many photos and the few that made it through are soo small.  It bothers me that Amazon would choose to hinder the complete reading experience.  I would not be very interested in doing a paid download again!!!!!

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I thought this might be a nice light fun even exciting read. It truly is nothing but garbage and there's nothing tantalizing in it at all. I found the whole thing to be garbage. Pick up a nice love story and that would be much better.
B0079J28NC|5.0|Although I own both the 1988 [[ASIN:630254016X Yellow Submarine [VHS]]] and the 1999 DVD version of  [[ASIN:B002HU4SRC Yellow Submarine]], I finally saw the film on the big screen in Fairfax, VA, for the first time today, and it was fantastic!  The print was the best I have ever seen, and it is brand-new, not a reissue of the 1999 version.  The soundtrack was excellent as well; though some of The Beatles' songs had strange-sounding mixes, that was probably the fault of the theater sound system.  I am really looking forward to receiving the new DVD in June.  I will add to this review after I have a chance to watch the new DVD.  Stay tuned...<br /><br />UPDATE:  I have now watched all of the new DVD, and the picture quality on the new version is much sharper and less grainy than the 1999 release; the soundtrack is much improved as well.  There are some differences between the two versions, which I will discuss now.<br /><br />AUDIO OPTIONS:<br /><br />1999: English 5.1 Surround (non-DTS); English Mono, 5.1 Surround (non-DTS) Music-Only Track (not on 2012 version, unfortunately).<br /><br />2012: English Dolby Stereo, English Mono, English DTS 5.1 Surround, German 5.1 Surround (non-DTS), Italian 5.1 Surround (non-DTS).<br /><br />The commentary track, featuring John Coates and Heinz Edelmann, is the same on both versions.<br /><br />SUBTITLES:<br /><br />1999: English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese (Only English and French are listed on the packaging).<br /><br />2012: English, German, Dutch, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Finnish, Polish (no Japanese - sorry, Yoko), and \\"Hard-of-Hearing\\" (HOH) English and German.  I wasn't sure what the difference was at first, but the HOH versions have parenthetical onscreen mentions of sound effects (e.g., (Laughter), (Giggling), (Explosion)), whereas the standard English and German subtitles do not.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Mod Odyssey\\" Featurette - same content on both versions; transferred \\"as is\\" on the 1999 version, but newly restored on the 2012 version.<br /><br />Original theatrical trailer - same content on both versions; transferred \\"as is\\" on the 1999 version, but newly restored on the 2012 version.  Also, the Apple Corps logo replaces the United Artists logo at the end of the trailer.<br /><br />Interviews - same on both versions.<br /><br />Storyboard sequences - appear to be the same content, but are presented in full-screen mode on the 1999 version, whereas they are in small boxes on the 2012 version.  For example, the \\"Sea of Monsters\\" storyboard sequence from 1999 has the storyboard sequence running at the top, with the film clip at the bottom.  On the 2012 edition, the two segments run side-by-side in little boxes, which are hard to see.<br /><br />Pencil drawings: The 1999 version has 29 drawings, the 2012 version has only 26 (the three Hey Bulldog cels are missing). Has the same presentation problems as the storyboard sequence (full-size in 1999, smaller in 2012).<br /><br />Behind-the-scenes photos - There are 30 full-screen photos in the 1999 version, but only 29 in the 2012 version. Once again, the 2012 photos are smaller.<br /><br />Also, the 1999 version has a counter at the bottom center of the screen for the storyboards, photos, and pencil drawings.  The 2012 version does not, and it is very tedious to count them manually.<br /><br />Booklet:  The 2012 booklet has a new essay by John Lasseter of Walt Disney Studios, and reproduces all of the mini-essays from the 1999 version.  The booklet also has more artwork.  The package also comes with four mini-cels of the cartoon John, Paul, George, and Ringo, a sticker sheet of both the individual and collective cartoon Beatles, a Blue Meanie, the Flying Glove (\\"It's not polite to point!\\"), Jeremy Hillary Boob, the LOVE logo, and the Yellow Submarine itself.  There is also a promotional flyer for the [[ASIN:0763658545 Yellow Submarine: Midi Edition]] picture book and the LOVE Cirque du Soleil show in Las Vegas (this is Apple, so what do you expect?).<br /><br />Look for the 1999 version if you want the original non-DTS English 5.1 soundtrack, the \\"music-only\\" non-DTS 5.1 soundtrack, the Japanese subtitles, and a full-screen presentation of the storyboards, pencil drawings, and behind-the-scenes photos.  Otherwise, get the 2012 version.  Of course, serious Beatles collectors will want both versions, as well as the 1988 VHS (which has the original 1968 U.S. edit of the film without the \\"Hey Bulldog\\" sequence - the original U.K. film had \\"Bulldog,\\" at least in some early prints), if they don't already have them.
B0007KS7D0|2.0|You're going to want to by a short lens hood with a lens cap, because this one is horrible. it's this stretchy plastic piece of junk that just slides over the front of the lens. It's tapered, so if you don't do it just right, part of the rim will fold in and keep the cap from going on. When you try to take it off, it's virtually impossible to do so. You have to pry it with your finger nails. I smeared the lens with my finger before I ever even used the stupid thing because it's so hard to take off. It also has a cap for the other end when you're not using it, but this requires unscrewing the lens from it's little adapter that snaps onto your lens. They should have made a cap that the adapter snaps onto so you don't have to unscrew it from the adapter every single time you want to put the other cap on. This is really, really, horribly designed by people who probably don't actually use it, or they'd realize how ridiculous it is. I've only taken a few pictures and it seems to be fine for image quality and it's definitely cheaper than alternatives (and doesn't mean a loss of light), but the caps make it a really bad product.

B000JU7NCE|1.0|I read with amusement some of the reviews here commenting on the poor editing/video production.  Wow.  You really need to buy this to appreciate how horrendous it is - seriously - it is beyond description.  This is the worst editing of concert footage I've ever seen in my life (and I must have 100 concert DVDs/Blu-Rays).<br /><br />The concert itself actually appears to be pretty awesome, if only they didn't edit the blank out of it and ruin it.<br /><br />It's just horrible on every level.  Not only have I seen a lot of concerts on video, I have an MFA from a prestigious film school in Los Angeles...  someone could actually use this to teach a class and illustrate everything you could possibly do wrong to ruin source material...<br /><br />- Intentionally cutting in poor quality video (even by DVD standards) for effect.<br />- ADD constant MTV on Steroids Cutting for no reason, other than to disorient the viewer so he/she never knows what he/she is looking at.<br />- Just overall bad cutting (like focusing on one person's head and beginning to pan down, and intercutting someone else's body with a different guitar).<br />- Constantly turning on what I'd call \\"Predator POV\\" (like in the Schwarzenegger film), and making everyone red/orange/green/blue blobby, unrecognizable messes.<br />- Doing bizarre transparencies of unrelated things over the concert footage (also using the \\"Predator POV\\" effect)... like a Ferris wheel during Fascination Street (huh?) or giant ants during another song (what?).<br />- Taking a 2 second unremarkable clip of, say, someone strumming a guitar, and playing it 20 times, out of sequence with the music.<br />- Making some kind of ripple effect on the screen.  Over and over.<br />- Making everyone and everything red.<br /><br />I've never done LSD (or any other drug), but maybe this is some kind of LSD version of what it's like to go to a Cure concert under some kind of illicit substance.  If so, this would make a great PSA, and 2 minutes 20 seconds is about all anyone should be subjected to anyway.<br /><br />Seriously, it had to have been released on April 1, originally...seconds is about all anyone should be subjected to anyway.<br /><br />Seriously, it had to have been released on April 1, originally...

B001TH16DS|5.0|In a very real sense, this is the one I was 'saving up for'. I own all three remastered seasons of the original STAR TREK but only the first is on Blu-ray. Why? Well, I kind of wanted just one major treat (in its current best possible showcase) so, for me, it became a case of choosing which season had the most magic and created the most impact when I was very young. In the end, emotion won out to cold, hard logic...<br /><br />I love the fact that the first season is clearly finding it's feet (a problem for some fans, admittedly), that everyone involved is giving it absolutely everything they've got and, in the majority of episodes, all that effort really does show - the whole venture feels like a hugely exciting and entertaining step into the unknown. And, of course, the wonderful CGI. The second season, on the other hand, is a little more \\"Ain't we doin' good, guys?\\", a touch of ego, smugness and better restaurants, alongside the expected hike in confidence. As a consequence, it's a little less likeable. Only marginally, but still. The third season...well it tries hard, but it can't quite shake off a very real sense of fatigue and disappointment at the imposed budgetary contraints and a dismal network-scheduled timeslot.<br /><br />The first season on Blu-ray is also beautiful to look at; the acting, the dialogue, the lighting...it's all first rate and leaps off the screen at the senses. And that's why it (my decision) makes perfect sense. Just one on Blu-ray, the rest on DVD. No dilution of the magic and a major treat by any other name. Anyone who's read my other reviews on seasons two and three will know how I feel about Star Trek, and why it remains the best tv sci-fi ever.<br /><br />EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED - A FEW CHOICE MOMENTS...<br /><br />ERRAND OF MERCY<br />Refusing to divulge information regarding the Federation's military strength, Kirk instead tells his Klingon captor, Kor, to \\"Go climb a tree\\". Superbly delivered by Shatner, I think we know what he's REALLY saying here.<br /><br />THE NAKED TIME<br />As the Enterprise plunges towards Psi 2000, an (alien spore) intoxicated Lt Kevin Riley has taken over the intership communications from another deck and is broadcasting (repeatedly) his dire rendition of the Irish 'classic', 'I'll Take You Home Again, Kathleen'. Uhura cannot silence the comms and Kirk is furious, so he tells her off. She instantly returns with, \\"Don't you think I would if I could!\\" and the captain is suitably chastised. A pause, then he apologises, to which she smiles, instantly forgiving him. The issues of authority and friendship (and stress!) are beautifully played here, rendering the moment incredibly subtle and effective. These are the little things that make Star Trek special.<br /><br />THE GALILEO SEVEN<br />The extended laughter of the entire bridge crew as Spock acknowledges he is a stubborn sod moments before the end credits begin to roll. It's either a complete cheese-fest OR an inspired piece of character-enhancement. Yeah, well it's the latter, ok? Ever the optimist.<br /><br />THE MAN TRAP<br />A fatigued McCoy contacts the bridge and asks Kirk for advice on how to relax a bit. Kirk recommends the same tablets prescribed to him by the good doctor on a previous occasion (they must have worked but had really unpleasant side-effects as he's clearly still narked about them). \\"You'll sleep\\", he says, before abruptly cutting off the comms screen.<br /><br />WHAT ARE LITTLE GIRLS MADE OF?<br />Ruk is a seven-and-a-half foot tall android killing machine.

B004EBZX6W|5.0|Omg this app helped me sooo much and its so cool you get to slide your finger across the bottom of the screen and see different examples of all of the wifi users and how good or bad of a connection you have.
B0017VG69U|5.0|A CLASSIC MAKEOVER, FROM MY AMAZON.CO.UK REVIEWS<br /><br />Excellent remastering of the original STAR TREK SEASON 2 source material. The new CGI Enterprise, planets and stars are seamlessly integrated and the 35mm episodes are given a vivid makeover. Those Starfleet 'red-shirts' have never looked more gloriously doomed (see a bunch of them drop like flies after being attacked by a sweet-smelling alien gas cloud in episode 13: OBSESSION). Fantastic stuff, and there's no doubt that the visual impact on display here would have been just what the creators had in mind over forty years ago, despite lacking the technology and the budget to make it a reality at the time. Has it been worth the wait, then? Absolutely...and yet, in the cutting-edge 21st century, there's still a tiny part of me that can't quite let go of the old 15ft long starship model (complete with rubbish matte lines) in orbit above the same old alien world - Alpha 177 - every other week. Nostalgia can be a double-edged sword.<br /><br />However, there are many great episodes in Season 2 which really benefit from the CGI treatment, including: AMOK TIME, THE DOOMSDAY MACHINE, THE IMMUNITY SYNDROME, JOURNEY TO BABEL and THE ULTIMATE COMPUTER.<br /><br />.........................<br /><br />SUSPENSION OF DISBELIEF: A FEW CHOICE MOMENTS REQUIRING THAT EXTRA BIT OF CONCENTRATION...<br /><br />Episode 3: THE CHANGELING<br />Uhura's had her mind wiped by a metre-tall space probe called Nomad. Fortunately, the Enterprise has the facilities to retrain and re-educate her. But surely that could take years? Not to mention dealing with the deep psychological trauma associated with such an incident. Apparently not. All you need in the 23rd century, it seems, is Nurse Chapel and a small library-computer screen. Soon be opening those hailing frequencies again, dear.<br />VERDICT: Utterly Amazing.<br /><br />Episode 10: JOURNEY TO BABEL<br />The Tellarite Ambassador, Gav, is an alien with anger-management issues. Hardly surprising given his badly-fitting mask, although it probably lent authenticity to the actor's performance. Clearly someone in the make-up department paying scant attention when that particular episode went before the cameras. Where's Roddenberry when you need him? (Given his penchant for the fairer sex in all their, er, IDIC, probably best not to ask.)<br />VERDICT: Painfully Obvious. And Obviously Painful.<br /><br />Episode 4: MIRROR MIRROR<br />This Parallel-Universe thing...no matter what your start point is, the simple action of stepping on a butterfly, so the theory goes, will cause events to change in the future. Paths that may have run along similar lines to begin with will eventually diverge. Given those circumstances, would the landing party and their evil counterparts REALLY be dealing with the Halkan Council at precisely the same moment in time to allow for a switch? Come on, what are the odds?<br />VERDICT: Somewhat Unlikely, I'd Say.<br /><br />EPISODE 26: ASSIGNMENT EARTH<br />Blatant attempt by Roddenberry to get an entirely different series off the ground. How can you tell? Easy, because Kirk and spock are given very little to do in the third act. And That Is Just Not On. I'd have called my agent long before the focus shifted towards the block of wood masquerading as Gary Seven and his annoyingly dopey 'assistant', Miss Roberta Lincoln. Bad call.<br />VERDICT: See How You Like Friday Nights At Ten, Buster.<br /><br />Episode 12: THE DEADLY YEARS<br />Typical Shatner, too vain to let Kirk suffer natural baldness during the story's rapid ageing mystery. We knew he wore a hairpiece even then but it's been bluff and denial ever since. Mind you, anyone who can emerge unscathed from a Comedy Central 'Roasting' has my everlasting respect.<br />VERDICT: If The Glue Sticks...<br /><br />Episode 4 (again!): MIRROR MIRROR<br />This moment doesn't strictly belong here, but being so unexpectedly cool I reckon it merits inclusion on any terms. Okay, here we go...as Kirk exits the turbolift on the 'mirror' Enterprise, the flat hand (not a fist, a hand) of an assassin thumps him on the face dead centre. A split second later the hand pulls away to reveal a bloodied lip and a disoriented Captain. Yes, there's a rather more cliched fight to follow, but that initial burst of violence certainly comes as a jolt and is excitingly choreographed.<br />VERDICT: Totally unpredictable and therefore one to cherish.<br /><br />.........................<br /><br />So, if you love STAR TREK and can ignore the occasional nagging voice of the inner purist, this is an essential purchase.<br /><br />VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDs Kirk exits the turbolift on the 'mirror' Enterprise, the flat hand (not a fist, a hand) of an assassin thumps him on the face dead centre.

B002BWP4A6|5.0|Reactionaries - and they comprise the delusion of majority - are people who will be the judge of what you mean when you speak. You will never explain what you actually meant \\"post factum\\" to a \\"reactionary\\"... Many movies define \\"abstract\\" very well. Believe what you want to believe; the question will probably remain: Do you know why you believe what you believe; or is your belief really only an incomplete thought influenced by people you consider your peers? And when the only form of communication you know is condescension; there is no way you could know they are your peers...
B0076NKNLA|4.0|Good performances throughout and interesting glimpse into the frailty of Marilyn Monroe along with her self-destructive behaviors. Particularly her equating attention of any kind with genuine love, and the belief that self-acceptance was to be found thru the eyes of others. Michelle Williams was excellent as Marilyn `off screen', but I just didn't buy her as `on screen Marilyn'.
0345803485|1.0|First of all, the person who penned this work really is an awful writer. She makes me think of grade school kids who are trying to get as many words as possible onto the page. There is absolutely no reason to use as many adjectives and adverbs as she does. I really can't believe a decent publisher put this piece of trash out. I don't really care about the sexual content but the quality of writing is really bad. I would not even give it one star.

1250000971|3.0|So, why not a great one? Well, firstly it is obviously the middle book in (at least?) a trilogy as you will see by the ending, but that's OK. I do, however, look forward somewhat to what I hope will be the finale! Any longer and we will be approaching an \\"exploitation\\" scenario! Firstly, some kudos! It was a nice touch by Mr. Archer for naming a character in the book, after presumably a friend who passed away, and a good guy at that and that's all I'll say. Secondly the book is highly readable, and like other Archer books, one that is hard to put down for mundane stuff like eating and sleeping! However, it does have some relatively big faults! I was somewhat disappointed that 2 of the main characters in the book (I'll not tell you who they are so as not to be a spoiler; you can work it out for yourself) are IMO \\"short changed\\" in that one of them literally disappears for 4 years, out of a 6 1/2 year time span for the book, and the other for three, with only a brief explanation over their \\"missing\\" years before they appear again, which I found to be very annoying. They disappear for years then pop up for the last few chapters, frankly IMO just to \\"whet your appetite\\" for the last book. It seemed to me this was also to keep the book to a \\"short\\" 339 pages which is also an annoyance, when you consider the 500-700 page length of most of Mr. Archer's other books! I also dislike this trend among authors of taking a good sized novel and adding a middle book as a \\"filler\\" to create a trilogy to extend/increase their revenues and Mr. Archer does that here, and as I said before, this novel is just a bridge to a final one! I find this crassly exploitive of reader's loyalties! At least with an author like Bernard Cornwell, and, for example his series like the \\"Saxon Stories\\" and the \\"Grail Quest\\", you know upfront that there are more books coming in the series but each one is a separate novel in itself with a hard and satisfying ending that still leaves you really wanting the next chapter/book in the series! At least Mr. Archer, so far, writes all the books himself, unlike other authors, such as James Patterson, who puts his name to some of his co-authored books that I believe are largely written by other authors, who quite frankly would have a hard time getting their ideas published, another pet peeve of mine.<br /><br />So overall a decent \\"bridging\\" book and read but an expensive one (for its length/plot), but hopefully the final one will be much, much better. I think 3 stars is a very fair rating for this book, at best!

B0012S59ZU|2.0|There seems to be some consensus that this is a classic, but I am unable to enjoy it.  I absolutely love Monk's Dream and was looking for more.  In contrast, this collection seems saxaphone-heavy, with Monk most often deep back.  Monk's Dream seems carefully crafted whereas here I feel like I'm walking in on a club performance with a lot of one-off improvisation.  And the tempo here is soporific, as if everyone's under-the-influence.  There is not a lot of material on the recording, but more of the same would not help me.  My search for a great second Monk  recording continues...

Everyone already knows the first two movies of the franchise are the best and blu ray cant help the last two movies except in picture quality.

I found nothing close to this in The Hunger Games. With effort I finished reading it hoping something would put me in a positive frame of mind, but I snapped the cover shut with a bad taste in my mouth. When our teenagers find this a wonderful book, we are in deep trouble. Don't waste your time or money on this one. I certainly don't intend to read any further.

0345803485|5.0|After reading the first book of the trilogy, I had many mixed feelings about the book and a curiosity about how others liked or disliked it.  So here I am, a clinical psychologist by training and in life, reading Amazon reviews.  About 2/3 of the reviews were either 1 or 5 stars, which probably mirrors what the novel elicits in others.  If one is looking for a good S&M novel to stimulate them, I'd pass on it.  Though probably erotic to some, I highly doubt that the sexual aspects of the book mirror any reality (other than one's first love and sexual discovery). More important, it (the eroticism) appears to be a secondary theme that is an extreme metaphor for the very true difficulties in what love means and how people love.<br /><br />\\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" (Book 1) was captivating, not for its sexual themes, but for its focus on the need for personal control and power, and how (yet unknown) early childhood trauma can shape one's sexual experiences for life.  It is ironic that Christian's idealized childhood (after his adoption at age 4) yielded such a disturbed sexuality whereas Ana's somewhat chaotic childhood (child of multiple divorces) led to such disparate sexual needs as adults.  \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" is also about love and what one may need to give up or accept for that love.  It portrays a push/pull relationship on both parts.<br /><br />Finally, \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" helps inform that all relationships are shades of gray rather than good or bad.  Explaining shades of gray in the book, submissives can have the ultimate power (viz., dominance) by their ability to say \\"stop\\" and dominants may have an unspoken need to have that control stripped from them or at least the possibility of it. There is no true 100% dominant nor a 100% submissive.<br /><br />Many people incorporate aspects of dominant and submissive behaviors into their sexual play but my understanding (limited, I'll admit) of true S&M needs is that sexual feelings can only be elicited in that specific context ... more akin to fetishes or paraphilia than sexual play.<br /><br />I already purchased the second novel of the Trilogy (thinking it was the first and then had to download the first book onto my iPad to read in the correct order) and am anxious to read if and how Christian's ambivalence about letting himself be loved is resolved and if Anastasia can hang in there for the distance.
B00006HBUA|5.0|This Movie is great its not like the cartoon but its still scooby Doo.I find this movie similar to Scooby Doo on zombie island 1998 Direct-to-Video Movie Which was good.Great buy.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|good I am lvl 12 and ilove it nothing like a other game no bugs. good game cant wait till I get cash
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I purchased the 3 boook set for my kindle and had completely read the series in less than 3 days.  While it was fascinating it was also a statement of how perverse this world has become to spend, spend, spend on the ridiculous and ignore the real issues in life.  These books can offer a glimpse of the future if we would only listen,  Well written, defintely worth reading.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved the trilogy. Author did a great job with the whole series including the ending. Couldn't have imagined a better ending!
B001E45XT4|5.0|I don't know how many headphones I've been through. I have a big head, big ears, and I wear glasses. Headphones always hurt my ears from pressing them into my glasses and give me headaches from being too tight. The way these are designed, they don't actually touch your ear -- they cup it, so there is no pressure at all. And yet, they stay on just fine! It boggles the mind. I love these headphones so much. I just finished playing 3 hours of Starcraft with them. The sound and mic are great, and they are perfectly comfortable. They feel very sturdy, even the cord. I have nothing bad to say at all about these, they are the headphones I have been looking for forever. Highly recommended for the serious gamer.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved the trilogy! Haven't read this much in a long time. If you liked the first book you will enjoy this one as well.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I loved this game. It reminded me of Myst but much more simple. The imagery was beautiful,  and is great for a fast but amusing play.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|When I first heard that this book was written for teenagers it totally put me off reading it. However, my friend kept telling me how good it is, so I gave in and read it. I am so glad that I did!<br /><br />There is very little that I can say about this book that hasn't already been said.<br /><br />It is a fast moving book. Full of excitement. I think this is a book for all ages. I couldn't wait to start the second book the minute that I finished the first book! That is were the Kindle came in handy!<br /><br />This book has been made into a film. But the book is a million times better then the film. Whatever you do don't judge the book by the film. I didn't really like the film, but I loved the book! :)
0345803493|5.0|I love that this book picks up three days post the last day from book 1. There really was nothing lost in between. The healing really begins in book 2. I laugh and cry. I also get mad as hell reading this book. But I must read book 3.
B00005LC4Z|5.0|It's a real classic that you need to watch at least 10 times more! Every time you watch, you find something that you missed before
0345803507|5.0|I love how in the beginning of this book the author gives us flashbacks into what occurred between book 2 and 3. I really felt I lost nothing. All three books are written from Anastasia's perspective. The entire time I'm reading these books with my BFF I kept saying this author could re-write these books from Christain's perspective and we could get some I sight into what he was thinking.<br /><br />Well at the end of this book she did exactly that but only for the first meeting with Ana.<br /><br />I cannot wait to Aesir what she comes up with next.
B0063IH60K|5.0|i have not had any problems with this game and it will rotate unlike some games. i like the differeng options to customize my game. very addicting!
0345803485|5.0|Erotic but if you can see past that the healing love story is beautiful. The secondary characters are memorable. When you finish you will immediately want book 2. Just buy all three together.
B007PS0X0W|2.0|I would have to say this was the worst Underworld out of the series. The story line was terrible. To me is seemed more of a Resident Evil movie than Underworld. The flickering lights that are in most of the movie are annoying. The film and graphics also seemed to be low budget compared to the other three movies.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It is ok so far. I just began playing. some of the games remind me of old school atari games so it is cute.
6305882592|5.0|Quirky, but with lessons learned, this movie says so much behind the ruse of dark comedy.<br />First, love knows not age - it looks beyond the surface to the heart. 2. Be who you are, not who others think or want you to be. This is just 2 of the many points this movie makes.<br />My favorite scenes:<br />Serious scene - When you notice the \\"number\\" tattooed on Maude's arm and realize, despite being in a concentration camp, this woman knows how to LIVE and values life - and the importance of living to the limit. She has had much sadness in her life, but is the very essence of the term \\"free spirit\\". She teaches a struggling young boy, who is attempting to find himself and find someone who cares about him, how to savor life and drink in the joy that surrounds all of us, even in the most unusual places, if only we take the time to look.<br />Without giving her plan away I will add this, she wants to bow out before life no longer has any \\"quality\\" left - something that would kill this brave woman slowly. This is the tragedy of the whole plot - almost like a hit and run for Harold, just when he learned how to love and really live.<br />Comedic scene - Apart from all the wacky suicide scenes, I love the scene when Harold has the gun and is going to kill himself - he points the gun at his head - then at Mom, trying to \\"decide\\" which would actually be best - his demise or hers. This movie says SO much if you really watch - and every time I watch, I notice more and learn more lessons about humility and how to live.
0393061310|2.0|The author's assertion that geographic and biological diversity shaped the evolution of civilization seems to me to have merit, but it also seems that he overstates its importance and distracts from it with faulty logic.  For example, he claims that mesoamericans (Aztecs, Incas, etc.) failed to develop the wheel because they had no domesticated animals suitable for pulling wheeled carts.  Yet, physics apply to humans as well as beasts.  In other words, rather than transporting goods on their backs, the mesoamericans could have moved them much more efficiently by pulling wheeled carts. Ultimately, however, New World civilizations failed to develop this basic technology.  There are enough examples of this sort to put the author's credibility--professorship aside--in question.<br /><br />And, my goodness, he beats his points to death.  And then kicks them for good measure.  The book could have been much more sharply written and reduced in size by a third.<br /><br />Moreover, although he makes the case that there were no innate differences among the races to make one superior to another in the context of making civiliations...he curiously makes the point that the primitive New Guinea folk he has come to know so well appear more intelligent and clever than the rest of us.<br /><br />In short, the author takes an interesting concept and injures it with writing that is superfluous, unconvincing and too often faulty.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Except for a minor error about a JFK speech (outdoor theater was actually Rice Stadium).  This book brought back many sheltered memories.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|What an amazing read.  It's hard to believe how brain washed people can be and what they can do to each other.  Even their own family.  I recommend this.  I read a lot of books about North Korea.  Their society is more of a fantasy world than what you'd find in the fiction aisles!
B007DJUO8O|4.0|Well, I must say this CD is not as accessible as I had thought it was going to be...or as long.<br /><br />I was about ready to give this a lesser review but it's totally growing on me. You really have to listen to it multiple times and be very patient.<br /><br />If you weren't raised on say, old school PT or some of Opeth's more abstract stuff then you'll have little chance of sticking with it, but I have been, and I did.<br /><br />I wish it was longer for sure but this is an undeniably well crafted CD with amazing production and soul to it...If you've got the patience to get into this CD and pick out all the soundscapes and emotions etc then you'll love it...just takes time
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I downloaded this app for my Samsung Galaxy Note. I purchased this app and it is now my exclusive e-reader app on my devices.  The book selection is adequate and it's very easy to purchase titles with this app.  I've had other e-reader and e-reader apps in the past but this one is the most user friendly especially when I am traveling or temporarily residing outside of the US.

B006M4RN3U|3.0|pretty FUN cd! I would listen to this song when I'm having a bad day and need some motivation.<br />I would recommend it for mostly anyone.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|First saw this movie on the airplane and then decided to purchase it as part of our movie collection.<br /><br />After the dvd arrived, I had a get together with friends and watch it again. They loved the movie. Very well make with a part that may not suitable for young children. This part has gun fire and a little physical closer towards the end. It was about policemen chasing drug dealers. This was the part where we pulsed the movie and all children in our get together went to another room.<br /><br />No sexual scene that I can recalled off. The actor & actress are well dressed, i.e no revealing clothing or bikini. No foul languages or hand gestures.<br /><br />Great Father Days' gift.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I have the Kindle app on my smartphone and on my android tablet.  In general, I find that the app works well but I find it tiring to read Times Roman or like serif'd fonts on paper, let alone on electronic screens.  My understanding is that human studies have shown that it is easier to read sans serif fonts and that readers have greater comprehension with them.  It doesn't seem like it should be a big deal to provide an option to display the book in a different font.
B006BG7RI0|5.0|\\"Here's looking at you, Kid!\\"<br /><br />I was 10 when the USA and Allied forces landed in Casablanca in late 1942. Shortly after that Warner Bros. opened the movie \\"Casablanca\\" in New York City. My Granny Vi was a massive Claude Rains fan, so she took me to see what became my favorite movie the day after it opened. Chances are the release print we saw that day had been inspected at the WB film lab since this was a roadshow. Almost certainly the projectionists had run it to check quality the previous morning. According to the schedule it had run 3 times for audiences before I saw that print, so it was in excellent shape. I was still a child actor in network radio then. In 1948 I started management training with another movie studio's Manhattan business office. So since then I have viewed a couple of thousand answer prints made from original negatives, just as a few weeks before Jack Warner had approved the answer print of the final release cut of \\"Casablanca\\"<br /><br />So let me tell you, I have looked at a lot of copies of Casablanca over the years. I made a Betamax recording off the air way back and then a VHS off cable. When DVD came along I bought successive restorations. Even on TV seeing a 16mm print Casablanca is a marvelous movie. It is filled with the quotes fans remember and use in casual conversation. When somebody says, \\"Round up the usual suspects\\" we know what is meant.<br /><br />This restoration and high resolution transfer to BluRay has to look as perfect as Jack Warner's answer print. There is not a blemish to be found. Nobody tried to second guess the artistic choices made originally. The scenes intended to be in low key are crisp, with no disruption in the shadows. Exterior high key scenes do not blow-out the highlights. \\"Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship!\\"<br /><br />All the many talented folks who have lovingly preserved and restored Casablanca are to be congratulated. Now pardon me as I fire up a BluRay player andBarco digital projector so I can hear \\"As Time Goes By\\" once more the way it was intended to sound.

B007P6VM04|5.0|Didn't buy from Amazon, but a huge Amazon supporter and customer.  Bought it from Target because i could get the extra 5 tracks.  Had to spend $3 more for the extra tracks, but worth it for Katherine's \\"Run\\".  Amazing.  Love the cd and love the show.
B000065U1N|1.0|I have been in the military. I found the story line hard to believe. The acting was poor. I would never watch it a second time. The person who told me it was wonderful was a hardcore military type. He must have been seeing something different then I saw. I like military films for the history. I did not find this movie to have any redeeming value.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I love this sharpener.  It is small and handy.  I have three other sharpeners which are full size but this one gets the most action.  It is always in my back pack which I carry to work.  I also carry a pocket knife everyday so it stays sharp.  The diamond file that whips out is handy for sharpening the serrated edges on blades, but I have found that it works extremely well on medical instruments as well.  Normally I would have to send in instruments that I use at work for $25 buck a pop to sharpen them, but with this little guy I am able to do it myself whenever I want without paying someone else.<br /><br />As far as sharpening knives, it leaves a really sharp edge to them.  It is really easy to use as well.  For the price you can't beat this thing.

Add to that the strange black screen crashes that happened, I uninstalled this. Ads make it un-fun and un-playable, and I'm certainly not interested in purchasing the paid version after this experience.

B0001DI0FI|5.0|I'm a female, and I love great movies, whether action, fantasy, sci-fi, or girly tearjerkers. This is a truly great movie, a genre-defining classic, meaning that in the years ahead, students will study it in film courses, and film festivals will give critical retrospectives, and people will ask \\"Why didn't this movie win the Oscar for Best Picture?\\" Just as people now appreciate \\"Night of the Hunter\\" and \\"Blade Runner\\" as visionary works of genius.<br /><br />What could possibly be visionary in a picture that some call \\"reactionary\\", \\"slow\\", \\"throwback\\", etc.? Well, the attention to warm, realistic detail that creates a completely different, utterly absorbing world where even what cgi there is, is imperceptible. The film is breathtakingly beautiful - Real Beauty, not synthetic gamer aesthetics. The sea, the ships, the colors, even the battles are beautiful and terrible and exciting and heartbreaking. The film explores a male friendship in an intelligent and, yes, sensitive but subtle way. There are no cheap thrills, no throwaways, everything about this movie is golden. The music, the inspired casting, the costumes, the story, the ending, everything is perfection.
B007G5K066|2.0|Got this movie on a recommendation.  Acting is wonderful, but the casting of the characters is a bit of a give away of the plot.  I had never read the book and had heard great reviews of this movie.  Immediately guessed who the baddy was because the character cast was just out of place.  Acting was superb, but here is the downside.... the story line is DRAGS along.  Kinda like being in the dental chair waiting for the drill.... you know its coming, but it just seems to take forever to happen, and when it does.... its just painful.
0345803485|1.0|Pure garbage. Don't waste your time. The sex scenes aren't even that good and it's fight after fight after fight on every single page. This was terrible.
B004LWZW7E|4.0|A good film, not the best acting, but,the characters grow on you. I wish they had more time to develop the story line more....(no pun intended).
0061706620|4.0|O.K., so if you're into the Supernatural series and have been paying close attention, this diary comes up a lot, especially in the early episodes. It makes the story lines come together by clearifying tons of subtle details of just what the hell is going on and what has come to pass before the boys started really kickin' some demon butt. It shines light on what their Dad was doing and to whom / what when they were kids. Refer to it often when you watch the shows again and again.
0545265355|3.0|I would have had no idea the book had arrived in France, hadn't it been for an email sent by Amazon a few days before sending it away.<br />The corners of the boxed set were a bit damaged and there was a weird white-grey matter on the books.<br />But I've got my books now and that's all that matters!
0374275637|5.0|This book sums up a lifetime of experimentation in the areas of judgment and decisionmaking.  Kaheman earned a Nobel laureate for this work.  He's an excellent writer too, and the 38 chapters -- each 10 pages long -- are nicely organized and tightly presented.  Anyone will be able to understand his work, and I suspect most everyone will be shaken up.<br /><br />Here is the main point. In ways we can understand and predict, we make systematic errors in judgment throughout the day. It's probably because of natural selection we're good at making quick judgments, and although they are often good enough they are also rife with shortcuts, exaggerations and mistakes, and these are capped off neatly with overconfidence.<br /><br />He says the mind has two operating systems, which he labels 1 and 2. The first is the intuitive mind, the transparent bit that recognizes a pencil as a pencil, or a face as angry or sad, and chooses between fight and flight. It also judges the size of numbers, keeps track of time, recalls memories, and basically takes the first quick swing at everything. We consider this \\"knowing.\\" System 2, what you might call \\"thinking\\" it includes estimation, calculation, and all manner of figuring out - much of which happens very fast and in general we're at least partially aware of it. Both systems cut corners, jump to conclusions, omit inconvenient information, exaggerate and guess. System 2's biggest problem, according to Kahneman, is laziness. It leaves System 1 in charge, and when called on it does the minimum required. Generally this means piecing together a credible solution, then quitting.<br /><br />This dichotomy seemed at first a bit forced to me, as I thought there must be a continuum instead, but it turned out to be a fabulous way to parse out how, when, and why our thinking can go wrong.<br /><br />Things we encounter first hand seem more important and more common than they should, as do things we can easily recall. When the chance of something (good or bad) is small we tend to either ignore or exaggerate the possibility of it happening. When judging an experience retroactively we focus on the peaks (highs and lows) and the end - duration doesn't count for much. We consider losses about twice as important as an equal gain. Thoughts immediately preceding can dramatically influence a judgment. In retrospect, assessing an event, we give far too little weight to blind luck. Considering options separately often results in different assessments than joint consideration. We use stereotypes to draw inferences from the group to the individual, and the other way around. We're bad at statistics. Consider this:<br /><br />A woman is seen reading the New York Times on the New York subway. Which of the following is a better bet about her level of education?<br />1. She has a PhD<br />2. She does not have a college degree<br /><br />If you chose the first, as I did, think again. There are a lot more nongraduates than PhDs riding the subway. We overlooked the base data.<br /><br />Here's a clever one:<br />Hearing that the highest incidences of kidney cancer in U.S. counties are found in the rural, sparsely populated states you might guess the reason: these places are poorer, less educated, with less access to health care, where people have high-fat diets, drink and smoke. That would certainly make some sense. It's a coherent, compelling and completely fabricated story.<br />If you had heard instead that these same areas have the lowest rates of kidney cancer, you might come up with this one: rural living is healthier, with fresh air, fresh locally grown food, more exercise and less stress than in urban areas. In either case we are able not only to throw up an explanation, we also diminish all effect of the countervailing arguments. We want a satisfactory explanation so our lazy System 2 can go back to rest. That's my story, in other words, and I'm sticking to it.<br /><br />So which of these two statements about kidney cancer is true? Both are true; you see, we also are bad with statistics. There are fewer people in rural counties, the measure is cases/1,000 people, so in rural counties the denominator is small. Random events in the numerator will cause large changes in the rate. Example: If a disease affects 20% of the greater population, in counties with just 2 people the rate is likely to be 0%. It could be 50% or (rarely) 100%. But it will never reflect the actual average. This is a statistical phenomenon that even statisticians overlook.<br /><br />Some of the findings in the book as so bizarre I still have my doubts, although the research seems sound, has been replicated, the results are consistent, and the effects are strong. For example, when subjects were asked to estimate the percentage of African nations which are members of the UN it mattered whether the respondents had just spun a 10 or 65 on a (rigged) \\"random\\" wheel. Their estimates for UN membership averaged 25% vs 45%, respectively! While people are holding a sequence of numbers in their head they have less self-control eating cake! Or if they grip a pencil between their teeth (forcing a smile) cartoons seem funnier to them, than when they hold it between pursed lips (forcing a frown). People pencil-frowning will concentrate more strongly on the task at hand. And people required to nod were more likely to agree with an editorial they listen to than those who were told to shake their heads. These results just seems absurd. Yet, I must admit: me calling them absurd is no evidence at all. It's just incredulity, which I've decided to set aside, as best I can.<br /><br />On the contrary, I found myself falling for many of the little test-yourself demonstrations in the book. Consider this question:<br />Was Ghandi 130 years old when he died? You'll know he wasn't. But how old was he, when he died? The typical response is significantly a larger number, compared to subjects who were first asked if he had died at the age of40. The first group would tend to adjust from 130 downward until they hit ages they thought were plausible; and the others do the same upward from 40. Someone who figured Ghandi was between 65 and 85 might guess nearly a 20 year difference, depending only on the anchor they had been primed with.<br /><br />Anchors are one of many points that can slip in to influence our thinking. Here are some others:<br /><br />The availability heuristic (129), confidence by coherence(209), the illusion of validity (211), the illusion of skill (212), the illusion of intuition/ strength of algorithms (223) , the hindsight bias (202), theillusion of control (259), the halo effect (199), nonregression to the mean (175), inside vs. outside view (248), the planning fallacy (250), stereotyping (168) , representativeness (149), the substitution effect(139), probability neglect (144), statistical and causal base rates (168), the conjunction fallacy (158), theory induced blindness (277), risk aversion (270), loss aversion (284), the endowment effect (293),bad news bias (301), possibility effect (311), certainty effect (311), the expectation principle (312), denominator neglect (329), and overweighting (333). There is narrow vs. broad framing (336), reference points (281), the sunk cost fallacy (345), and the evaluability hypothesis(360), and the effect of categories (356). The focusing illusion (402) is a simple one, with reach: (\\"nothing in life is as important as you think it is when you are thinking about it\\"), as is WYSIATI (153: \\"what you see is all there is\\"). And Kahneman's prospect theory (circa 1979: with lifelong collaborator Amos Tversky) is developed throughout the book. They showed that people evaluate risks on the basis of losses and gains from a reference point, and not simply on outcomes as utility theory would suggest.<br /><br />This all may seem like a chore to work through, but it's not. The writing is very clear and engaging, and the 38 well-crafted chapters are each, remarkably, 10 pages long. The book has plenty of examples, end notes with references, concluding advice, a couple full reprints in two appendices, and lots of little demonstrations you can try on yourself. Another example of these. Which of these two opportunities would you prefer?:<br /><br />1. a gamble that offers a 10% chance to win $95 and 90% chance to lose $5?<br />2. or would you pay $5 for a 10% chance to win $100 and a 90% chance to win nothing?<br /><br />Most people find the second one more attractive, but look again. The fact that they are identical is difficult to see because we are more adverse to losing $5 than we are to paying $5. Here's another: You are considering surgery (with slightly better long-term results than radiation therapy) and you were told, about the surgery<br /><br />1. The one-month survival rate is 90%<br />2. There is a 10% mortality in the first month.<br /><br />Doesn't the first one sound better? Or this:<br /><br />* Adam switches from a gas-guzzler of 12 mpg to a slightly less voracious guzzler: 14 mpg<br />* Beth switches from a 30 mpg car to one that runs at 40 mpg<br /><br />Who will save more gas by switching? The answer is Adam, by a large margin.<br /><br />One of the best sections of the book is the last. It describes two very distinct senses of self: one is the experiencing self and the other, the remembering self. When someone asks \\"how are you?\\" you might hear \\"how's your mood right now?\\" but are more likely to respond to \\"how have things been going?\\" ... in other words ... \\"how do you like your memories?\\" It's the remembering self that most people care about, whether they're looking at their own lives (it's why we take pictures on vacations) or others'. When subjects were asked to imagine taking a dream vacation, but afterward all memory of it would be erased, most would not send themselves (or another amnesic) to climb over mountains or go trekking through the jungle. \\"These experiences are mostly painful in realtime and gain value from the expectation that both the pain and the joy of reaching the goal will be memorable.\\" \\"Odd as it may seem,\\" Kahneman concludes, \\"I am my remembering self, and the experiencing self, who does my living, is like a stranger to me.\\"<br /><br />Unfortunately, it's a little worse still, because the remembering self doesn't represent the experiencing self very well. Looking back, durations of experiences don't matter much. Just two things do: 1. peaks (good or bad), and 2. how it ended. Kahneman explains how education, religion, illness, poverty, wealth, and other factors impact the two forms of satisfaction.<br /><br />It's a great book, I believe it's a full life's work, and my criticisms are minor. I thought that maybe not enough distinction was made between one-time judgments and iterated ones. In the Prisoner's Dilemma, for example, once-off games lead to mutual defection but when done repeatedly with the same players (as in the real world) it leads instead to altruism. Some of the results in a psychology lab may be quite different in the real world. There are also a few surprising typos, like a mix-up on page 335, where \\"AD\\" and \\"BC\\" are switched, throwing off the explanation; and on page 337 two miscalculations in the formulas actually invalidate the results.<br /><br />But if these are the low points, they are not very low. The peaks were many and very high (for me) and even though I felt the last chapter might have been slightly overreaching, it ended well oo. It took a while to read, but duration doesn't count for much -- I'm very pleased. It will sit on my top shelf, next to Pinker.<br /><br />(Ghandi died at 79, BTW)
B0015DROBO|2.0|I'm not sure why there is so much hype around this book/series.  It was very boring!  I almost quit reading it several times, but I just kept thinking it would get better.  It didn't!  I will not read the next 2.  I might watch the movies when they come out.  I was very dissapointed in this book!

0439023521|5.0|I was intrigued by the Hunger Games. I kept seeing it on bookstores' shelves, and was wondering if a new trilogy could outperform recent, successful ones. Mixed reviews kept fuelling my interest. My verdict: very good. Fast-paced, well written, engaging, unusual, smart, and... bloody. I am in between two minds about the bloody aspect of the novel, which is usually put on the young adult shelves. Thinking about it, I wouldn't be very keen on my children reading it until they are old enough. True, some of what they watch and read nowadays is almost worse than this. The premise of the novel is a game organised by a Government built on the remnants of what used to be the USA, featuring a group of children of all ages brought together in a large fenced area, and asked to fight to death with each other until there is only one last, successful fighter. The game is filmed: reality TV at its worst. I have a problem with premises featuring children killing each other for pleasure (not that those in the book really want to kill each other to start with); you just don't want those ideas in our children's minds. But then again, this is fiction. I loved \\"Lord of the Flies\\" by William Golding, a terrible story about children stuck on a remote island and starting to kill each other, but the premise was different (a reenactment of society, not a game) and it was really an adult book at the end of the day. Having said that, I really liked the Hunger Games. It think it is innovative, clever and has a great plot. I'm looking forward to reading the sequel.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|love it but wish there were a few more mini games ....fun! if you like tap zoo type games you'll love it
B006M7JCC2|5.0|It opens your mind to really understand what lies beyond physical death and give you a sense of calm and joy in your life right now. Most importantly it helps you to live your life with more courage and less fear.<br />Excellent book overall.
B002WN35DC|1.0|I want my money back.  This is a cheap product.  This book is useless without the illustrations.<br /><br />Deseo que me regresen mi dinero.  Este producto barato es inutil sin ilustraciones.

0345803493|5.0|I love this book.  You can read the trilogy out of context and still enjoy it.  It references back and forth.  I just can't get enough of these books.
0553801473|5.0|I give this book 5 stars and cant wait for the next one.  Everybook I have ordered has come in excellent condition and from different parts of the states, which I find really amazing.  everybody should read these.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Great game and a lot of fun.  Not a fan of the energy thing but I can forgive that.  I highly recommend it. Plus you can't beat free games.
B004GJDQT8|3.0|Works pretty good actually for a phone device.  However, Amazon hasn't figured out that there are these things called tablets out there.  Why they don't detect either the OS version or screen resolution and address accordingly is too bad, they are really missing out from an experience perspective.  The Windowshop app just doesn't have the functionality that you'd need from the cell phone app.<br /><br />Keep working on it, but kudos for a great phone app if you want to check on a shipment or grab that cable or odd and end you need while out and about.
0231161166|5.0|This is my first or second favorite science book that I have read that was written for the public at large. The author did an amazing job presenting the wonderful world of epigenetics. I myself learned quite a lot reading the book, and I have a background in the sciences.<br /><br />I do not know how hard of a read this book would be for the layperson.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was a gift from my wish list after commenting in a Random Acts Of Kindness (RAOK) thread in the Amazon forums. I don't even know who gave it to me but thank you so much! Totally enjoyed this trilogy, the characters were  engaging. Looking forward to seeing the movie.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|I love this game. BUT my 7yr old loves it too. THEN the icon for SEX shows up. Ok i put it on child safe mode. I think that took sex out... BUT the HINT for sex was still there. He kept trying the single hint and l kept saying &quot;sex... but what combination?&quot;<br /><br />Now I am stuck explaining sex to my 7 Year old &amp; I may have to remove the app before his mother sees it. Let me say the adult themes are great and funny... BUT come on! don't leave SEX in the game at all! Now what will happen if he plays Sin vs Virtue? is lust with the hotsexpot icon going to pop up?<br /><br />love the program and you are idiots to not allow it to be truly censored for my kid.
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|I remember this book kicking around the house when I was a kid in the 70s. I remember reading it up until the part with the horse's head and then I stopped. Yikes. Fast forward to 2011, when I read it on my shoe (cell phone). Times change but this story is timeless, the characters warm even in a cold blooded fictional crime world. So glad I came back to read this big, classic story.<br /><br />PS -- still haven't seen this movie.
B007DJUO8O|3.0|Not a bad album, but definitely not worth all of the hype about it. It is an interesting acoustic based record put together by two great musicians, who should in theory have made a better record. Again, it's not bad, it just kind of meanders along, not much happens musically. Kudos to both Wilson and Akerfeldt for following their muse, but considering the catalogs of both artists, this should have been better...
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Saturday mornings are always special. Saturday mornings spent in the darkened movie house with your youngest son, who has only seen The Avengers once before, but is dying to see it his second time because, &#34;...Dad, everybody has seen it at least twice but me!&#34; begins with drama.  Captain America's recognition of the One True God is delicious. Phil's death and Ironman's response, along with Captain America's debriefing are fabulous.  Ironman's shocked rejoinder, &#34;Phil?&#34; sets the pace.  Everyone involved deserves a Hero's welcome. But the producer could have found a little more upscale eatery for lunch. It must have been working out all the CGI payroll that got him off his game.  'The Avengers' good? Fa'geddaboutit! You're going to love it.

B0068TJLSY|1.0|this pathetic excuse for a movie took my money, wasted my time, my energy.<br /><br />i can't believe Spielberg produced this utter ridiculous joke.<br /><br />if you are 5 years old, then go see the movie, if you have a brain at all and an adult, please stay away as this garbage will suck the life out of and drain you dry.<br /><br />really bad B movie is a good rating for this cheese wiz.
B003L7DK74|5.0|First off, Flight of the Conchords is comedy genius! It's one of my favourite shows of all time, it's just fantastic. For 30 bucks it's definitely worth buying. The dvd quality is very top notch (higher quality than you can get by downloading it online). Despite all this I may have to return my copy because the case corners were slightly crushed and the slip cover for season 2 had a 1 inch jagged crack in the top left corner. This might not bug some people but it bugs me. When I buy something I expect it in mint condition.
B002OMZTSK|5.0|Originally read this when it first came out. Still one of my favorite books, continue to read the series even though they are written for a younger demographic. The characters are ones that you want to keep wanting to know more about, and root for. The author seems to be able to transport you back to high school, and make you enjoy it all over again (or for the first time for some readers). While the ending wasn't a fairy tale you knew Russel and everyone else's story wasn't finished yet.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Wow, this puzzle is so much fun (I'm 21)! I was worried it'd arrive damaged like others had experienced, but it was packaged well and arrived in one piece! I think I've gotten up into the 50s, 60s but it goes up to 120 or something! Makes a great display piece since it comes with a stand, I have mine fully visible on a shelf. There is a bucket step that slides around that I've been worried about breaking because it slides back and forth as you go through all the other steps, but it hasn't broken yet. Definitely not something for a small child; A responsible adolescent most likely.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|It was a wonderful series since my father was in World War 2, Also Korea and Viet Nam. He was to  proud to serve in the US Marine Corps. He retired in 1970 and my husband retired from the Marine Corps. He served in Viet Nam. The only thing wrong with the movie was the cursing, and that is wrong about all movies they don't need the language to make a good movie. Jan

B005LLXB9K|3.0|Let me start off by saying that I'm a big Pearl Jam fan - from their beginnings - and bought Ten in late 1991 before it \\"hit it big\\" after hearing \\"Alive\\" on local alt radio.  I still feel strongly that it is one of the greatest and most influential rock albums EVER recorded. I was very excited to watch this movie/documentary, but, I must say, it left me disappointed. It started off very promising, with a compelling intro, but then failed to maintain the narrative. It amounts to a bunch of interview responses (not necessarily with the interviewer's question heard first) shown along with clips of the band playing live, presented chronologically throughout their career. Okay, so where's the backstory? Like: How *exactly* were you discovered/signed? What was it like recording your first album? How was it recorded? (tracked/live) Was it intimidating to work in the studio? (they mentioned that Eddie was shy; that's it on the backstory). What was it like working with Rick Parashar, the guru producer who crafted this *amazing* sound that was copied for a decade! Couldn't we have heard from him? Such a missed opportunity. Butch Vig gets so much credit (rightfully so) for his work with Nirvana. And, why did Pearl Jam later remix Alive for their greatest hits? Not covered here. How did they go about selecting producers to work with? Not covered. Also, the movie would have benefited from a consistent voice-over narration to tie all of the pieces together. There was some narration, but not enough. The musical-chair drummer situation was covered in under 30-seconds, over an hour into the movie; but this was a huge issue and influenced the band's sound as they moved from one drummer to the next. These differing *sounds* were not explored. The band was never asked to \\"give me your thoughts\\" on each and every album (great, good, bad, bomb), or \\"which album was your favorite?\\", or \\"which songs are your favorite?\\", or \\"were you consciously trying to change your sound, or did that just happen/evolve?\\". And, how about more info on their song writing process. We learned that Eddie took over from Stone somewhere around Vitology, but that was it. The deepest nugget was the seeming admission that the band recoiled (perhaps subconsciously) from success. These guys never really wanted to be this famous -- this should have been explored more. I shouldn't be able to learn more from Wikipedia than I did from watching this documentary. After the first hour it became apparent that the film just was not going to dig deeper. Don't get me wrong, it certainly has some entertainment and nostalgic value, but it falls far short of what it could have been. So, what could it have been, you ask? See the Foo Fighters \\"Back and Forth\\".
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved it!! coudnt put it down, its so smart and easily written... Fun, sexy,different, very distracting, I really enjoyed it! Its a must.
B00180R06I|5.0|I was thoroughly prepared to dislike this film.  I had tried Dreyer's Joan of Arc and found it tedious (I'll be revisiting it soon) and had read some things about Vampyr that suggested it would be dull and confusing (like some parts of the BFI book on the film [[ASIN:1844570738 Vampyr]]).<br /><br />I got a chance to watch it with a friend (double-billed with the Lugosi [[ASIN:B000035Z3K Dracula ]] - luckily we watched Lugosi first) and I was captivated by about 5 minutes in.  The cinematography and the direction are superb - there are all sorts of little touches that unsettle you from the start.  There are a number of genuinely creepy and scary moments.<br /><br />Most of all, I was simply riveted by the film - it's compellingly strange and unnerving.  There's something fascinating in almost every shot (to the point where I actually found it quite tiring to watch - I was so focused and intent on every detail).<br /><br />My friend, I will add, was not as happy with the film as I - in particular the oblique story-line that doesn't really resolve (it does come to an emotionally satisfying end, but without ever really clarifying what it was that happened) and the general lack of coherent narrative were problems.  while I will grant that the film has its flaws, it was so compelling that I have to give it 5 stars.  I will probabvly watch it a second time in short order (something I rarely do).<br /><br />For what it's worth, this is much more like watching a silent film than a talkie - there's very little dialogue, though there are some significant sound effects and suitable music.

B000784WMW|5.0|I read Jane Eyre in high school,  and every winter since!  It is a favorite book that I never tire of.  I've seen the Orson Welles version-  and found it dark and foreboding-  other versions chop the book to pieces and do not follow the story line completely.  With this version a person can practically read along in the book!  I love the way the characters are portrayed from the child Jane and her companions at Lowewood school through the wonderful adult Jane and Mr. Rochester and the others throughout the book.  St. John is portrayed beautifully and just as I pictured him in my teenaged mind!  I love Jane's simplicity and stubbornness towards integrity and living as she wants to live.  I love Mr. Rochester's brooding yet loving face and actions.  A wonderful diversion whether you watch it all at once or a little at a time.  A note to teenagers who want to write a book report without doing the reading.....  you can watch this and do just fine!  =D  5 stars all the way!

B00723NWJE|3.0|I must be in the minority for thinking Jones is an overrated artist. I mean, right from her debut she was a darling. She came along and gave popular music some soft jazz touches back in 2002 and ended up selling 10 million plus. But I have stuck with her for some reason. I have bought each of her albums and found the same problem each time--a handful of gems padded by plodding background muzak. It's not as if Jones demonstrates her musical virtuosity or lyrical prowess. No, she strikes me as average on both fronts.<br /><br />But there is something about her music. There was \\"Come Away With Me\\" and \\"I Don't Know Why\\", or \\"Sunrise\\" and \\"Creepin' In\\", or \\"Wish I Could\\" and \\"Broken\\" or \\"Chasing Pirates\\" and \\"Young Blood\\" or \\"Bull Rider\\" and \\"Take Off Your Cool\\". Each of these songs showcase the best in Norah Jones and her ability to actually vary her sound. Unfortunately, this has not translated to an entire album of gems.<br /><br />\\"Little Broken Hearts\\" is no different, and I found myself thinking the same thing again--when I listen to the album all the way through it is rather monotonous. This album was being hailed and promoted as a dark and drastic style change but it isn't. It's Norah Jones, just less jazzy. But this started with her last album, 2009's \\"The Fall\\". That album was a direction sign as to where Jones was heading musically.<br /><br />Now, I continue to look forward to what Jones will do in the future, because she is trying to change, and that I respect. She just hasn't hit her groove yet. So, once again, there are a handful of solid tracks here like \\"Say Goodbye\\", \\"She's 22\\", \\"4 Broken Hearts\\", \\"Happy Pills\\" and \\"Miriam\\". \\"Miriam\\" in particular is interesting because of Jones' approach to the dissolution of her relationship--directly targeting the mistress who contributed to its undoing. She doesn't just attack the other woman, but she also toys with her and even sympathizes with her as well.<br /><br />So, three and a half stars. Jones has much room to mature and grow as an artist. I bought the deluxe version from Target that had the three bonus tracks, and \\"I Don't Wanna Hear Another Sound\\" is the best of the three. Overall, \\"Little Broken Hearts\\" isn't the best break-up album I've ever heard, and it's not the most interesting meditation on love and relationships either. But, it manages to hang together relatively well even if it comes off as monotonous at times in terms of its musical approach.<br /><br />Here's how \\"Little Broken Hearts\\" compares to Norah Jones' other works:<br /><br />2002 Come Away With Me: Three and a Half Stars<br />2004 Feels Like Home: Three Stars<br />2007 Not Too Late: Two Stars<br />2009 The Fall: Four Stars<br />2010 ...Featuring Norah Jones: Three Stars<br />2012 Little Broken Hearts: Three and a Half Starsm to mature and grow as an artist.

B007SSEBCU|1.0|As others have said, Meryl Streep is a great actress.  However, the film I believe had a political agenda.  In sum, the film's message was that Mrs. Thatcher's efforts were a failure.  It would have been interesting if the story took off from her father's forewarning of the post-war socialism emerging in Great Britain, and indeed throughout Europe now, and its current economic state.  She wanted to reduce the climate of populace dependency and inspire citizens to be productive and contributors to the national economy.  Mrs. Thatcher was a visionary and has left an enduring legacy whose efforts reestablished Britain as a world-power and improved its economic position.  I was not impressed with this film.

0374203032|4.0|My first introduction to Michael Sandel was the iTunes lectures on political philosophy lectures he gave at Harvard. I watched each of his lectures twice, and soaked in Professor Sandel's insights and superb teaching style. The lectures prompted me to read numerous philosophical works of the past, as well as some of Sandel's other works. I knew I had to read his newest book when I saw it in the philosophy section of the book store the other day, and I feel a better person for having done so.<br /><br />The author states that he does not have the answers to many of the questions and ideas raised in his book but that his overall goal is to get a discussion started. A discussion about whether or not our society should allow the free markets to enter any and all aspects of our lives. Sandel aptly argues that the free market is not a system that is blind to morals and ethics. He relies on two ideas that are brought up time and time again throughout the book: 1) inequality and 2) corruption. One of the author's points that has been a bit of a game changer for me is the idea that markets do not necessarily get goods into the hands of those who value them most. He uses an example of great seats at a baseball game to demonstrate his point. Sandel says that those who are willing to pay the most for great baseball tickets may not be those who value them most highly but merely those who have the deepest pockets. Surely there are kids watching games on TV who know every stat, collect every card, and worship players beyond individuals with the deepest pockets. For many, purchasing a ticket represents a large percentage of their income, which in turn represents their higher valuing of the ticket than the individual who is spending a much smaller percentage of his/her income to purchase a great ticket. This is such a simple principle but one which I had not given much thought to previously. This idea of markets not always getting goods into the hands of those who value them most highly is found throughout the book.<br /><br />Sandel uses so many recent examples to illustrate his many points, that this book is not only a great introduction into ethics and values but also a great primer into modern situations/events that affect each of us. I found the examples to be very helpful. I also found myself disagreeing with many of his suppositions. I admit that I am a bit of a Nietzschean, and Sandel's idea's of right and wrong are sometimes frustrating. For people like myself who believe strongly in moral relativism and social constructionism, it was difficult to accept Sandel's views on things being good or things being inherently bad.

I found the examples to be very helpful. I also found myself disagreeing with many of his suppositions. I admit that I am a bit of a Nietzschean, and Sandel's idea's of right and wrong are sometimes frustrating.

B001AR4K8K|5.0|This movie has it all. It have funny parts, scary parts, great cast, and a badass story. This movie makes you want to be a vampire. Sleep all day, party all night, and never have to worry about dying. If you are one of the VERY few people who hasnt checked this movie out, then what the hell are you waiting on, get it and enjoy!
B003P2V5FY|5.0|I bought this for my 9-year old daughter who is a big Katy Perry fan.  I listened to it first to ensure it was appropriate.  While some songs were borderline, I definitely banned, \\"Let me see your Peacock.\\"  I wouldn't recommend that song to anyone under 25. The song, \\"Circle the Drain\\" is another one that I wouldn't recommend letting a young child listen to.  I have to admit that I enjoy her music, too, but still want my kids to be kids for a while.  Good rhythm, fun music and light hearted fun for the most part.
B007WV05GY|4.0|So when I watched the trailer for this movie, I was thinking it was going to be this battle for survival where I get to see Liam Neeson and some other humans go to war with some wolves after surviving a plane crash.<br />*Semi-spoiler Alert!*<br />It doesn't turn out that way. Rather, the human survivors of the plane crash (led by Neeson's character), in a cruel twist of fate, are slowly picked off by the wolves as they try to make their way back to civilization. In fact, there is really only one scene where the humans are able to retaliate and kick some wolf butt. Otherwise, the humans slowly succumb to both the wolves and harsh winter climate. So the movie is rather depressing if you watch it thinking you are going to see an awesome display of the human will to survive against all odds. Instead of giving you the idea that \\"surviving against all odds is really likely\\", there are other points the movie tries to make...one in particular seems to be that if you're in a lot of trouble don't expect a miracle from God to get you out of it, because it isn't happening in this flick...you're on your own.<br /><br />The reason I gave this movie 4 stars is because although it is kinda depressing, the story is still good, and so is the acting.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|This game is just like playing the old style Mario. really cool graphics and easy controls. I would recommend thisnto my friends and family.'
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I have a kindle fire. this worked great for about 2 days... the. it stopped working. wouldent open. redownloaded. still wouldent open. don't get it!
B0000VCZKM|5.0|I purchased this for my 3 year-old grandson who was about to accompany his mom to her school's production of Annie. He must have watched this movie a dozen times. By the time the night came to see the play, he knew every song and treated his mom to a personal singalong.
B004APVI1G|4.0|If you are looking for a good 3D movie for the kids this is your movie. It is in the top 5 best looking 3d movies along with Rio, Open Season, Puss anf boots, and Tangled.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|The book was so well written and gives an incredible glimpse into this totalitarian repressive state. The depth of depravity of the North Korean government has never been made clearer to me until after I finished this book.<br />I think  that anyone who considers themselves a caring and compassionate person needs to understand what is going on inside North Korea.<br />Basically the North Korean government is causing genocide to its own people.<br />The seriousness of the situation is made extremely clear in this book.<br /><br />This documentary of the cruelty to which man can cause toward his fellow man is just a real eye opener.<br /><br />I could not put it down
B005LAIGSM|1.0|If your hoping to see the story portrayed in the book, this IS NOT IT.  The movie is a about newlyweds who are in a car crash and the woman receives a brain injury that causes her to forget the last couple of years but that is the ONLY similarity.<br />I was hoping for a story was similar to the book.  The book was great!!!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This book is a must read for David Balducci followers. Captivating story line that moves easily and smoothly.<br />It is an excellent addition to any library.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Outstanding writer. I could not put my kindle down. I can't wait for the sequel! This is one of the best new books I have read in a long while.
B005VPRFSY|5.0|This set is great, considering the new c-3po and sand-troopers are in a set that isn't an expensive set. The escape pod looks very good and high detailed, and it sturdy. All in all, recommended for any star wars fan.
B004LWZW2E|4.0|This was a very eerie movie. The music kind of helped send the creepy factor over the edge, that is until the ending. It is almost like the second half of the movie was written by a totally different person. Overall not a bad move definitely has a few good scares.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|There is no doubt that this debut album is a winner on many levels. I recently saw the band on Dave Letterman show singing Hold On and boy did they rock out, enough to get my interest pricked and I bought the album that night after previewing some of the tracks on Amazon. Brittany's voice grabs you by the \\"short and curlies\\" and doesn't let you go til the end of this delightful sonic blast. I like all the music here and think it would stand the test of time easily, especially heartbreaker,rise to the sun, hold on, boys and girls,I found you, be mine, on your way, I ain't the same,hang loose, you ain't alone and goin' to the party. Oh wait...yes, well that's all the tracks on the album. So there you go.<br /><br />There is one small hiccup, and that is to do with the packaging. Why oh why don't the record companies wake up and put  plastic sleeves over the cds just like albums have? The second time I removed the cd from it's cover to play it was marked by the cover and that gets right up my nose you guys! Seriously how much more would it cost to cover the cds?<br /><br />I still think this is a terrific album and one worth investigating.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Honestly believe everyone on earth should read this book - have recommended to several people and loved by all. Totally blew me away - will change your life forever.  For your own sake - read this book now.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is a great game for any age. Great building scheme and if  you are patient you don't have to buy money/acorns. My daughter and I love it. She gets a kick out of all the Ice Age characters.
0691152640|4.0|The authors put a tremendous amount of research and effort into this book and for this I value the book. By doing so, the authors render a clear service in collecting the information presented in the book and furthering our understanding of the ubiquity, frequency and depth of financial turmoil. Regrettably, their research shows that our current financial circumstances are more difficult than usual.<br /><br />I had hoped to derive useful insights for investing. I have read other books - The Big Short, Dying of Money, Lords of Finance, etc. - with this same purpose. However, while I was greatly impressed with the authors' effort and commitment, the main lesson that I drew from the book is that financial distress is quite common and recovery from it can be painful and lengthy. I expect our recovery to be so.<br /><br />The book may aid an investor if one invests overseas. The historical tendencies of individual countries may be of some use.  An investor may avoid some countries because of their financial history. For instance, if one loans money to Argentina or Greece with an expectation of repayment, you are quite likely to get what you deserve.<br /><br />The book notes that inflation is one common political response to national financial distress. Indeed, I have read a blog by Professor Rogoff observing that the United States' current overcommitted financial circumstances might be eased by inflation. This, too, probably lies in our future. The book, Dying of Money, about the German hyperinflation of the 1920's may provide some practical guidance on this point.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|i like this game but some ones are hard to do but it is fun and it does pass time :)
B003YOZNBK|3.0|This is a very interesting take on the western genre. Now I gotta tell you I never read or even heard of the comics before watching this movie. There were parts of the movie that were interesting and kept me entertained, then there were parts that I found rather boring. They should of stuck more to the rebel/renegade fell that the movie starts out with.
0765310015|2.0|This review is about the entire series rather than simply the first book (GotM), as I can't seem to find a page on Amazon regarding the whole series. In any case, what you get in GotM is what you get in the rest of the books, so it is applicable.<br /><br />I have enjoyed fantasy epics for a long time, since reading fluff like the Belgariad when I was a child. I'm also one of those people that, once a book is begun, cannot put it down until finishing, no matter how awful - and since I purchased the entire Malazan series...<br /><br />Much of what I'm about to write has already been mentioned scores of times in the negative or somewhat negative reviews this book has received. I'll divide it into the good, the bad, and the ugly.<br /><br />The Good (or things I liked): As many have mentioned the world-building highlights Erikson's imagination, there are a wide variety of protagonists in the book, which go beyond what you typically find in a fantasy epic (mage, swordsman, thief etc), and this adds some originality. Some of the devices used to highlight a character's personality are original and entertaining - Iskaral Pust, Greyfrog, Kruppe. There are also moments and passages in this series which are well worth the read - some that come to mind are the battle of Pale (GotM), the introduction of Karsa Orlong (HoC), the early part of MT regarding the Tiste Edur...they are the moments when the plot is focused, when the characters have important roles to play and you stay with them long enough to see development - or when the action is fast paced and well described, and leaves you wanting to find out what happens. Unfortunately these moments are simply too few and far between. Some of the character and place names are fairly cool.<br /><br />The Bad (or things I disliked): Place names and character names are, many times, silly beyond belief, as if Erikson ran out of ideas and recruited his 6 year old nephew to help him out. He spends long, sometimes unbearable amounts of time, philosophizing through his characters. I can't count the amount of times I found myself wanting to skip entire pages, knowing they'd bore me to tears. The books could have been reduced in length (and improved in quality) had there been more focus, or as someone suggested, a better editor. There are simply too many characters - I enjoy complex, intricate works, but too much of anything is never a good thing, and here Erikson goes overboard, filling each book with character after character, to the developmental detriment of all of them.<br /><br />The Ugly (or things that make it bad): Until now what I mentioned were subjective observations, things I personally liked or disliked but which may inspire different feelings in other readers. Maybe some people enjoy huge swathes of philosophy being spouted by characters you suspect never received an education (but who cares about consistency?), maybe you enjoy infinite characters or maybe you dislike focused storytelling; however, trying to be more objective, Erikson fails on many levels which are prerequisites for good writing. Characters are introduced with no rhyme or reason, no real effect on anything. Then they, or others who seem to be built up as important, disappear for no good reason. Plots and subplots fizzle out for no apparent reason, or are left hanging. Many things simply happen for, like I said, apparently no good reason, other than to fill out the books. Deus Ex Machina is the order of the day, present in inverse proportion to consistency. And at times the writing itself is god-awful, messy, convoluted stuff, painful to read.<br /><br />I get the feeling that Erikson wanted to participate in what has been, for a while, a trend to create vast fantasy epics, and that he has sacrificed quality and focus for the sake of scope, to the ultimate detriment of the series itself, and his readers. Some people will love it, but some people also loved Baywatch. Next to ASOFAI (yes, very different in many ways, but filled with good writing, coherent character development and plots) this just doesn't come close to standing up.
0385344228|5.0|I like courtroom dramas so this was an easy book for me to pick up. At first I was a little worried that the plot mirrored Presumed Innocent a bit too much - but I shouldn't have worried. Defending Jacob is at least a page-turner and at best it is about 10X better than Presumed Innocent. The plot, characters, twists and turns are all very well constructed. I hated to see this book end. I found I really cared about Andy Barber's plight - and his unfortunate past. Defending Jacob also raised, for me, new questions about nature vs. nurture, that old college age question. Is one's future strictly dependent upon his ancestral past? Can a nurturing upbringing erase all those questionable relatives of centuries past? Old questions which, in this book, were given new tools to answer them. I'm glad Landay didn't get preachy here - he might have, for parenting is fertile ground for someone with strong opinions on how much a child is his own person. But, he held his opinions to himself, let us, the reader, pretty much decide for ourselves and take a great courtroom ride.  I loved this book, can't wait to start another of Landay's. What more can a book deliver?
B005EGXTEE|5.0|The book was very enjoyable and the characters came to life before your eyes.  Bit gruesome in places but when you are fighting for survival human nature makes you fight that much harder.  Found I could not put the book down, or Kindle even.
B007OAAK0O|5.0|My husband and I went to this concert after work (I worked on 57th and Park) and remember it like it was yesterday. Can't wait to get the DVD (I wish it were on BluRay!!!) and relive it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B001KZVQJI|4.0|This was a fantastic looking movie. I have yet to be disappointed by the special effects in a Peter Jackson movie. The only thing I disliked about this movie was the length. Besides that this was a great movie.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|It is a fun way to kill time. And the kids enjoy it a lot... Thank you for the game!
B000QUCNOK|1.0|I will make this brief. SPOILER ALERT!!! This is not the movie of one murder, it's the story of a psychopath on a murder spree of young, beautiful women. This is a man with a bad case of OCD and only one aspect to his personality -- smell. That's it. He feels nothing for anyone and is a hollow person. He believes he can capture the scent of a woman, which is in his view, the most perfect, wonderful, fulfilling smell there is. But at the end of the day, this is just a killer and you're watching a movie of a psycopath. You hope and hope he does not kill the lovely, sweet, perfect Laura, but then he does. Ugh, and then the end is possibly the strangest, stupidest end to a movie I've ever seen. It didn't even follow the \\"scent\\", so to speak, of the movie. There's nothing likable about this movie. In the end, I hoped Alan Rickman's character would kill him, but then he doesn't. Ugh. I'm so annoyed.
B007SGM084|4.0|Like so many thousands, I switched to Kindle for ease of available reading material, to not have stacks of books all over the house, and to save money on my reading habit.  Using Kindle has only accomplished the first thing; VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!  I am interested in this set of books based on having read the first few chapters, however I am NOT INTERESTED in paying inflated prices. It would be helpful to me, and I am sure to your reading audience, to have an explanation of why in a lot of cases, your prices exceed the bookshelf price.  I recently got stung when I purchased the first 2 books in the Hunger Games seies, only to discover that I could have gotten all 3 for a liitle obver $15.00 (I paid more than that for the first 2).  I was unable to cancel the order and get all 3 for the better price.  That was very shoddy on your part.  Continuing practices of this kind will not help your bottom line, as I am sure others, like myself will only buy the cheaper offerings.  Go to Costco where you can get new books for $5.97.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I wish I had read the other reviews before downloading this game! Like many others there was a glitche and all my times reset to ridiculous amount of hours. I was also frustrated with the notifications. I turned all of them off but it would continue to beep at me even while my Kindle was off. Extremely annoying!! I don't have the patience or optimism that this getting fixed anytime soon so I am uninstalling.
B003YHSE7W|4.0|I like this one more than the first. Everything was already set up in the first movie, so with this.one we get to jump right in to Iron Man. Mickey Rourke makes a great villian and he has been in some great movies here lately. The wrestler was a great movie. Downey has been making a hell of a come back to. Check this one out, then go see avengers!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Good sequel to the Hunger Games. I didn't think the plot was nearly as exciting as \\"Hunger Games\\" until the very end. The plot was unpredictable, but slow moving. D0n't get me wrong, I liked the \\"Catching Fire\\" and over all a good book with imagination.
B002IFT1ZA|3.0|If you want to see and hear the practice of: Idolatry,Blaspemy,Adultery,Incest,Male and Female homo-sexual acts,Rape,Murder,Theft and Fornication you will like this program. The main thing that the featured actors could not have,was a conscience. So most of the featured charaters were conscienceless and were required to be.<br /><br />If you want to see most of the Ten Commandents broken over and over you'll like this body of work. Now don't get me wrong this needed to be done so as to fit into the scheme of this historical story.<br /><br />Charli O
142312166X|4.0|This book provided a lot of insight about what happens between some of the books of the series.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Some information was lacking though.
0345803485|2.0|Okay well I read this book at the insistence of some friends. The writing was decent, I didn't have to go through it with a highlighter like I've been known to do. The characters have some personality but the plot was rather trite; \\"virgin falls for the dashing man with a dark edge\\".<br /><br />The book wasn't all that erotic. Constantly reading \\"down there\\" and \\"inner goddess\\" just made me chuckle and roll my eyes. Also, not that kinky. If you're in the lifestyle, have dabbled in kink or just aren't that tame in your pleasures this book will make you go: \\"oh, I did that last week,\\"<br /><br />If you are not into kink please know that there is a lot of mis information in this book.<br /><br />I wont say it was a bad book, because it wasn't, but it wasn't all that great either. don't buy into the hype.
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|Let me start by saying that I think the 3D in Beauty and the Beast looked better than Lion Kings, but the transfer to blu ray lookes so magnificent that I had to give this movie 5 stars. I also have to give Disney credit, cause it looks like they are really starting to get the hang of 3d. Can't wait to see what they have in store next.
B000VDUWMC|1.0|I purchased this as my first e-book on my new Kindle.  I was pleased at first, until I realized that the e-book contained NONE of the many figures referenced throughout the book.  I might understand that the copyrighted photos are not included (although if I get them in the printed book, why not the e-book?), but the various figures are the author's own work and are absolutely necessary to fully understand the book.  It is disconcerting to read, \\"...as can be seen in Figure 2.1...\\" but have no such figure.  It is inexcusable to charge this much for an e-book and not include the material from the print version.  I didn't get this for free, I paid for it.  The phrase, \\"Some images from the print edition are not available in the Kindle edition due to rights issues,\\" is not sufficient to let the buyer know that it contains NONE of the images, and it should be displayed more prominently.  This book should not be offered as an e-book until it contains all the pertinent information.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is soo awesome and cool. it lets u pick whatever game you feel like playing and gives u points for it. the more points u get the more games you unlock. I give this game a thumbs up!
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Great game very fun lots of content keeps me busy while bored at work would reccomend for everyone, keep the great games coming
B0067AC5KA|5.0|Stieg Larsson's \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" was one of those books that I purchased and read because of the hype from the movie.  Not only was I intrigued with it because of the movie, but also because of the original title, \\"Men Who Hate Women\\".  The novel turned into one of those books that I couldn't put down when I started reading it.  The characters complex; the story at times, dark and violent.  Despite the translation from Swedish to English, the story flowed through each transition.  Lisbeth Salander, the lead female character, a strong lead, despite her circumstances. The best part, you're guessing all the way till the end on just who done it.<br /><br />Looking forward to reading the rest of the Millenium Trilogy.  Strongly recommend this book for any reader who enjoys hard core crime mysteries.
B003Y5HWMW|1.0|I'm a big fan of the books; well the first 3 anyway. You know what I mean if you have read all of them. I didn't see the 1st season when it was on HBO originally, but they started re-airing the 1st season in January  to get ready for the 2nd season. I almost pre-ordered the 1st season on Blu-Ray, but I decided to wait and watch it on HBO. Boy am I glad I did. Now I know a lot of people really like this HBO series. I got through the first 4 or 5 episodes of the 1st season; not loving it, but just watching because I enjoyed the book so much. Right off the bat didn't like how they depicted the whites in the opening scene. They are slow and sluggish in the book; strike 1. Several characters are presented well; Robb Stark, Jon Snow, Arya Stark, Littlefinger, to name just a few. But Tyrion Lannister is probably the most interesting characters in the books and Peter Dinklage does a good job, but he is too good looking and isn't shown enough. Sean Bean as Ned Stark is too brutish. It was really hard to get past Catelyn Stark looking like such an old hag; strike 2. The final straw was their depiction of Loras Tyrell and Renly Baratheon; couldn't believe it. Don't know where they came up with that. I asked a friend of mine who turned me on to the books; he hasn't seen the entire 1st season either. I explained how they depicted sir Loras and Renly and he never suspected how they portrayed them in the HBO series. I won't drop any spoilers, but after that I didn't have any desire to watch the series; strike 3. I've turned it on the 2nd season a couple times since then, but always turn it off. If you have read the books don't waste your money buying this. Also, I don't even recommend wasting your time renting and watching it.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Made me want to read more - which I am. As soon as I finished the last page, I was online adding the second book in the series to my Kindle!
B006OCM0G0|3.0|pretty cool game but needs more stuff like and to access facebook would be cool so you could get more invites out
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I love this game. while not super challenging its got a great theme to it and looks great. there's just something charming about it
B005COO1X6|3.0|First, one has to keep in mind that this is a short story and not a complete novel.  If you're new to the author or haven't read much of King's writings, then you'll probably enjoy it.  The writing style is classic Stephen King, with the reader not knowing what the monster is until the very end.<br /><br />That being said, as much as I love Stephen King, even his short stories, I wasn't exactly wow'd by this story.  Call it the curse of familiarity.  Read any author enough and you're bound to find at least one story that reminds you of another story they've written.  For me, the theme of \\"Mile 81\\" reminded me too much of another one of his shorts, \\"The Mangler\\" from  Night Shift.  A disappointment though was the use of the stories protagonist towards the end.  The shift in direction on a character that so much emphasis was placed on in the beginning, fell flat at the end.  Again, the curse of familiarity, knowing that the author's protagonists tend to end strong or at least have a significant role in the monster's demise.<br /><br />Were I new to Stephen King's writing, I would probably give this a 4 out of 5 star rating.  However, knowing King's previous works, I have to give this a 3 out of 5 just because it felt like it had been done before.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|Fun game. The micro payment mechanism is silly. Nothing really worth dropping real money on. The real pile of crape in this sundae is the bug that resets timers to 80 hours. Most end game buildings are on a 10 to 24 hour timer. Neccesities like medicine are much quicker so when your buildings mysteriously put themselves on a 80 hour timer all you can do is uninstall.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I have never written a review before but this is absolutely amazing. The power, pace, detail, style and suspense this book has is nothing short of amazing. If the rest of the series is anywhere near as good as this then we have just read the first installment of a legend. Epic in the truest sense of the word...
B007X15GRQ|3.0|This movie was completely enjoyable, even though I usually avoid drugs/thieves/cops movies. C'mon, Mark Walberg and Kate Beckinsale. How could you go wrong?
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I will admit i have put off reading anything from this trilogy. BOY WAS I MISTAKEN!!! Suzanne Collins grabs you from start to finish. I would read until i could no longer stay awake then pick it back up at first light. there are no dull moments and the story leads you deeper and deeper into the games. I promise you will not be sorry you bought them. i am now looking forward to the movie.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I first got this app for my ipod touch and it started crashing with an update I gave it. I was so excited when I saw it in the kindle app store because I would be able to play again. After like 3 days IT STARTED CRASHING AGAIN HERE. what gives?? D:
B0012HRJEA|4.0|Well, as you may expect, I am watching this in school with the rest of the class. Romeo and Juliet was definitely a timeless story, but this modern-day adaptation took it to the most unbelievable heights! In this version of the classic, it's all set in pure modern-day, complete with television, beaches, cars, buildings, etc. And guess what? The characters still speak in Shakespearean English! This makes a really hilarious impact upon the film! They even call the guns \\"swords\\", since the guns are manufactured by a fictional company named Sword, so you can easily tell that the laughs you got from all this were intentional.<br /><br />Not all is undramatic, though. After all, Romeo and Juliet IS a tragic play. The movie still captured that tragic image, as characters grew pretty emotional during scenes from Mercutio's death to beyond. In fact, I'm actually kinda annoyed by some scenes. You see, said scenes are way, WAY more emotional than they need to be. For example, when Juliet refuses to marry Paris even after Romeo's banished, she and Capulet push each other around during an overly heated argument (Juliet cries this whole time while trying to talk back). I really would've just preferred an angry argument. And after that, when Juliet goes to Friar Lawrence, there's another conversation, but she was STILL sobbing, and even held a gun to her head for a brief moment! This is just too much...<br /><br />But aside from scenes like those, this is a very fresh take on Romeo and Juliet. It's really funny to see the characters re-imagined in this modern-day world. I bet that after footage was taken, the actors were laughing for quite some time, considering what they had just spoken to each other (The acting itself is actually very top-notch, if not a little overboard, like what I described above).
B004BBDHEK|4.0|I haven't listened to Yanni since the 1990's when I was a big fan.  I like this music though.  It's different from the 90s music but is good because it has good melodies and production.  Not too much good new age music to be found these days but this is good and new instrumental music!<br /><br />Well that's my opinion anyway!<br /><br />Hope people like it!
B00164GDD2|5.0|I love ghostbusters, I remember seeing this movie as a kid and it scaring the crap out of me.  Now I can enjoy the comic genius.  The blu-ray is great, it makes it easy to catch all the cheesey special effect problems that we were never meant to see.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This game is many in one and it's a lot of fun, but a few are pretty difficult to get through. It sometimes takes quite a few tries, but you're rewarded for your attempts. It's fun if you have a lot of spare time.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I think this one was the most boring one out of the 3. Nothing special. I guess the book gets slightly more interesting at the end.
B007PBKG5G|5.0|Christmas! That's what it felt like the first time I heard this band. The grit, the feel, the young woman's voice and soul - have not been this excited over a band in a VERY long time. Blues and REAL R&B. Thanks, Shakes!
0345803485|1.0|I've never read a novel in the erotica/romance genre before and figured I'd give this one a shot because of all the hype.  If nothing else, I'd be more current on pop culture.  Yikes.  Bad, bad, bad.  The writing is just so embarrassingly lame.  There were a few phrases, such as, \\"Penny for your thoughts!,' he asked her,\\" which was written not once, but twice, that briefly made me wonder if this was a period piece because really, when did people actually say \\"Penny for your thoughts?\\"  The 1950's?  But then I realized that nope, it's not set in the 50's, it's just very poorly written.  And the constant \\"Oh my's!\\" that Anastasia thinks to herself get almost as annoying as the repeated references to her \\"inner goddess,\\" which remind me of a tampon ad.  And is Christian supposed to be the embodiment of an enthralling, sexy guy that makes women weak in the knees?  I get that a lot of women are attracted to emotionally unavailable, damaged guys with the hopes that they are the ones who can \\"fix\\" them and make them understand how to love and be loved, but Christian's unbelievable control issues are just infuriating.  This guy is a total stalker, and it is not sexy!  Do women really want stalkers?  Apparently the heroine here, does, which in my mind makes her just as emotionally damaged as Christian.  Yet since it's told in first person by her, I get the sense that she's supposed to be the \\"every girl\\" girl with whom the reader is supposed to identify.  And I know that I should suspend disbelief when reading fiction, but when exactly does he have time to run his multi-billion dollar company?  It seems like all of his waking moments are spent either a) stalking Anastasia or b) emailing Anastasia or c) engaging in punishing sex with Anastasia or d) alternating between being stiffly formal (ie, muttering dated phrases like, \\"Penny for your thoughts!\\") and going over to his dark side while giving brooding, smoldering stares.  While I know that people probably don't read romance novels for the writing, I'm sure there must be some decently written books in this genre out there.  Unfortunately, this isn't one of them.
B007VPLNGW|5.0|just got this a few minutes ago.  I have never liked a game enough to submit a review before.  a very good distraction when I really needed one.
0446581348|5.0|This book shows and explained exactly why and how to use makeup. It also gives you a little history about makeup and how to start of as a makeup artist. Easy read and priceless information. Go get it!!!
B006ZZAMWK|4.0|I will preface this review with the disclaimer that I am Boy Band Obsessed (BBO). I have known for quite some time now, and am proud to admit it. That somewhat biased face being said, I absolutely love the cd. All of the tracks are upbeat and catchy and definitely kept me dancing all day (and night). I obviously bought this cd because of \\"What Makes You Beautiful\\" and \\"I Wish\\" but all of the tracks are fantastic. My favorite is \\"I Want\\", I feel like it has a truly unique sound for a boy band and I cannot get enough. I highly recommend this purchase if you are also BBO.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Very fun but I'd like more missions!! Please add  more missions/goals, otherwise it gets a but boring sometimes waiting to level up.

0345803485|5.0|I throughly enjoyed this book; however, it is much more enjoyable if you intend to read the trilogy. Once I started reading, I could not put the books down. I highly recommend this series.
B0063GORYU|4.0|The program is easy to use and has clear graphics. It handles well on Kindle. I enjoy it and recommend it.
B000UBMSB8|5.0|I was spectical about buying BLADE RUNNER this way at first.  I finally did and Im very pleased with the edition I recived plays great and all 4 verison are all in perfect picture.  Althought I have a BLURAY player which does add for the better picture and sound but still it is a great verison. I like the Thearical the best cause is has Harrison Ford commenting throughout the film. I was very inmpressed thought by the other verisons. I like the original ending thought the best wish they would have did that in the other verisons but otherwise not bad at all.

0345525558|4.0|I would have titled this book THE BLOSSOMING OF VICTORIA!  Victoria has an attachment disorder stemming from her life in various foster homes, a frustrated social worker who has come to blame the victim, and  bullying in her schools.  When she becomes emancipated at age 18, she is left facing the world on her own.  She has both mental and physical responses to closeness to others. She is fortunate to find a few people who are able to deal with her distant behaviors for lengthy periods of time, but when she begins to feel that they want to be too close, she recoils with the feeling that the relationship will not last, and she will be hurt once again.<br /><br />Some of the negative reviews indicated that the readers found her to be insufferable, and I would imagine that most of us would have liked to give her a piece of our minds. It has been well-researched that people who have not been able to bond with a parent or parent-substitute very early in life develop self-protective behaviors based on their belief that they are unlovable. This of course has been their history if they have been rejected or abandoned repeatedly as Victoria was. I have seen this in my work, and helping a person change requires enormous patience and sensitivity.<br /><br />As the story unfolds, Victoria blossoms like a very slow opening flower, and then like some flowers, she closes up again.  She makes small strides, and continues to work toward being able to become intimate and to receive and express her feelings with words as much as with flowers.  A very interesting character and a great story of the ultimate power of love.

B007SYWFRM|4.0|All seven of my grandchildren love the Ice Age movies, however, we had no idea whatto expect when we accidentally came across this game on my newKindle Fire. We decided to try it and now, whenever they visit me, the first thing they ask is if they can play &quot;Ice Age &quot;. They, or should I say we, have a great time with it.
B001KWTBVQ|5.0|Well, I already knew I loved this version of the fairy-tale from my childhood, and I'm certain the plot is known.  I was wholly pleased with the price, speed of arrival and condition it arrived in.  Best of all, I no longer have to dig out the VCR to enjoy one of my favorite guilty pleasure/comfort movies. Happy customer, all the way around.
B001NESPHC|5.0|Melody Gardot's music touches the soul and evokes sweet emotions of joy, reminisce, sadness and recovery. Her voice is smooth and calming, while delivering beautiful music from her heart to ours. I highly recommend that you purchase this album!

B0000714BP|5.0|At long last I'm finding some of my long-time favorites on DVD inexpensive enough that I can update from VHS!<br /><br />I will never, ever forget my first viewing of To Wong Foo, as we call it in my house.  I laughed often, and felt good afterward, and knew I had to own it even though (and maybe because) it was a wee bit campy.<br /><br />My kids, who are now 18 and 21, also love to watch this movie again and again, we pull it out every 3 to six months and enjoy it just as much as in the beginning... even though we can all recite most of the lines.  \\"Oooh, girl... did you just do a U-ie?!\\" Can't help but adore Wesley Snipes as Noxema Jackson.  :)  The same is true of Patrick Swayze and John Leguizamo in their respective roles - the guys were firmly ensconced in their manly man archetypes, and they took a chance on doing something so completely out of character that it was possible it could kill the public perception of them forever.<br /><br />It didn't.  :D
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|Game of Thrones is an incredible work of film. It is exciting, dark, suspenseful, violent and simply loads of fun.<br /><br />I bought Game of Thrones based on word of mouth recommendations and I was blown away from the start.  GOT simply possesses all the traits I look for in a series.  However, I knew GOT was special because, just like a good book, I couldnt stop watching it once I started.<br /><br />I gave GOT the highest review I could because once I started to watch it, I couldn't put it down.  That is really my benchmark for greatness as it's a very rare thing for me to start watching a television series and be glued to the tube for several of its episodes.  A great buy.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The story certainly keeps your attention.  The thought of children killing children turned me off, but the story is riveting and has a good moral ending.
0307951529|5.0|If you've ever dreamed of turning your passion into a small business, buy this book.  The case studies and Chris's guidelines and blueprints will deliver a swift kick to your posterior.  After reading just a few chapters you'll realize there is no reason you can't do it.  Highly recommended!
B001KOFH2G|5.0|I already knew I adored this movie.  Love the deal, the quality of the disc and box... I couldn't have been any happier with this purchase unless it came with Nathan Fillion himself in the box.<br /><br />Browncoat Girls, I know you know what I mean.  :)
B001KVZ6HK|1.0|Storytelling as an art? What's that? And, who cares anyway? When Hollywood makes tons of money off of bad movies, then where's the financial incentive to make decent films? 2012 is turning out to the worst year in decades - and I have been going to the movies for over 40 years, so that's saying something - for really bad blockbusters: first, Hunger Games; next, Dark Shadows; and now The Avengers! (WANT TO SEE WHAT GOOD FILM MAKING LOOKS LIKE? I'VE PRAISED EVERY ONE OF THESE FILMS WITH A 5-STAR REVIEW: [[ASIN:B00319KS7C The Informant!]] and [[ASIN:B0014DZ2WS Never Back Down (Single-Disc Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B004LWZW4C X-Men: First Class (+ Digital Copy) [Blu-ray]]] and [[ASIN:B004N66Y1G Farewell]] and [[ASIN:B0034G4P7G The Social Network (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]] and [[ASIN:0898707390 (Father) Damien (de Veuster of Hawaii) [VHS]]] and [[ASIN:B002LFGC7W Battle For Terra]] and [[ASIN:0783229364 The Secret of My Success]] and [[ASIN:B000056HQR Common Ground [VHS]]])<br /><br />I am so sick and tired of New York City, specifically the island of Manhattan, being attacked in the movies. Hello! It was attacked in real life only a little over 10 years ago costing the lives of over 3,000+ real people, including my brother's co-worker, co-worker's wife and unborn child! But what is really despicable is that at the very end of the The Avengers you briefly get to see a real-life news photo from 9/11 mourning the dead. That's just plain, disgusting exploitation!<br /><br />But lets not stop there! At the end of the film we get to briefly hear a local New York State Senator rant about how our Avenger heroes &#34;wrecked Manhattan.&#34; That our heroes who just risked their lives in a 1,000+ ways are to &#34;blame&#34; for all the destruction! Fine! I agree many politicians are real jerks, but to put the letter &#34;D&#34; for Democrat next to this Senator's name speaks volumes about the films real message: Democrats holding elective office are nothing more than ungrateful, winy creeps! That's real cute! I thought Hollywood was sooooooo liberal! If you going to interject politics into a film then why not put a &#34;R&#34; for Republicans after the Senator's name? After all, the Republicans in Congress fought tooth and nail to prevent the establishment of a Federally funded medical fund for First Responders whose health was permanently impaired by breathing in all the toxic debris that was released into the air!<br /><br />The Avengers is also plain boring with the most two-dimensional characters in the history of film making! Sure I wanted the good guys to win! Sure the guys have cute muscles and the gals are all pretty! But, really now, who cares when there is zero character development and the storyline is about as exciting as watching Frosty The Snowman for the tenth time!<br /><br />The last third of the Avengers is nothing more than war porn! I will never watch another super hero movie that has a character from The Avengers as long as I live! Even for free, or if Hollywood offers me a million dollars! Overall,  Hollywood has done a decent job with the X-Men, but for some reason the right-wing kooks who control the Avenger characters have turned them into nothing more than an exploitative moneymaking machine. No wonder why Stan Lee was so happy in his cameo appearance at the end of the film! It's just too bad he and the rest of Hollywood has to stoop so low to make a buck!<br /><br />For those of you who have never taken a film class in college before: A GOOD FILM HAS AN INTERESTING STORY AND ACTORS THAT INTERACT WELL WITH EACH OTHER! It really is not too hard to imagine! You could even write it on the back of a matchbook cover!<br /><br />See: [[ASIN:0195181727 Hollywood Left and Right: How Movie Stars Shaped American Politics]] and The State of the American Mind: Stupor and Pathetic Docility: Volume One and City of Dust: Illness, Arrogance, and 9/11 (FT Press Science)and The Toxic Clouds Of 9/11: A Looming Health Disaster and ATeachable Moment: A Facilitator's Guide to Activities for Processing, Debriefing, Reviewing and Reflection and Grow Up!: How Taking Responsibility Can Make You a Happy Adult<br /><br />Footnote 1: By the way, Frosty, The Snowman is a much more entertaining story than The Avengers. It has stood the test of time! Unlike The Avengers, which will be quickly forgotten! But I certainly wouldn't want to watch Frosty for the 10th time!ocessing, Debriefing, Reviewing and Reflection and Grow Up!: How Taking Responsibility Can Make You a Happy Adult  Footnote 1: By the way, Frosty, The Snowman is a much more entertaining story than The Avengers.

1594203334|2.0|My problem with the book is the gross generalizations and complete lack of common sense! Duh, you need to pause and observe your child. That's not an American/ French difference - that is common sense. If Pamela Druckerman is the person representing the USA, God help us all, because she lacks this common sense in raising her kids as far as I can tell from the book. Rubber floors in the bathroom?<br />As an American mother of four I didn't find any tricks to make my kids behave better. They all \\"do their nights\\" and eat what is put on the table.  Some of the stories are mildly entertaining but this would not be my go to book on raising children.

B0017X5H1Q|5.0|A compelling read, \\"The Razor's Edge\\" is a top 10 all-time novel. The quest for understanding the meaning of life and gaining inner peace is one that speaks to many people, though I suspect many people are like the characters that oppose or try to rope in Larry Darrell. This is a novel where you either \\"get\\" Larry or you don't. I loved the main character, and the story. Two movies were made of \\"The Razor's Edge.\\" The 1946 version with Tyrone Power and the 1984 version with Bill Murray. The Murray version is best, and has superb music. The novel, though, is better than the movies.

B005FJ7DOM|5.0|After I ran out of zombie movies to watch and review, I decided to watch Stake Land.<br />I loved it.  Good camera work, good scenery, good acting and the movie flowed.<br />We have a vampire hunter called Mister who is teaching a teenage boy how to survive<br />in a world that has been over-run with vampires that are slow and stupid for the most part.<br />The sun kills them, stakes kill them, and the really bad ones have to be spiked in the brain.<br />The gore factor was high and realistic looking.  The pair are traveling to a place in Canada called<br />\\"New Eden\\" where rumors tell of a settlement of survivors living well.  They pick up others on<br />their way to New Eden. Some really bad people called \\"The Brotherhood\\" have a large territory<br />our team has to drive through and survive.  These guys are worse than the vampires!<br />I am not going to spoil the movie for you.  If you like zombie movies, you will find that this<br />movie about vampire undead is a new twist on a vampire saga.  If you like the Twilight series, you<br />may find this movie disappointing because the vampires are stupid and savage.  Our hero team do<br />not have Buffy powers, either.  Enjoy!

B0059XTUVI|3.0|Well acted and interesting historical content while depressing in tone. Set in the late years of mental decline and sad issues to be faced by a person of great historical stature. Numerous flashback stories of her early life and interest in politics at a young age. Much of the presentation dwells on the unhappy state of personal decline in her late years. Mental errors in her imagination play tricks with her memory.
B0079J27SS|5.0|I've been a fan of these recordings for over 40 years and they sound better than ever in these new EMI DSD/SACD remasterings.  But folks shouldn't expect miracles.  Not even DSD/SACD technology can make a fifty year old analog recording sound as if it had been recorded yesterday.  That said, I thank EMI for taking the trouble to apply the newest technology to older recordings like these because the benefit is real, even though that benefit registers as a greater subtlety in the projection of texture, not in a super Hi-Fi transformation of the original recordings.  With Klemperer performances, greater textural subtlety yields large rewards because he was a master at balancing orchestral choirs, at making everything in a classical composition \\"sound\\" clearly and in perspective.  In short, the new remastering helps us better hear what Klemperer was trying to achieve.  The fact remains that the newest recordings in this set sound best overall.<br /><br />As for the performances, they are what they are.  HIP fanatics probably will dismiss them as archaic and irrelevant, while the \\"speed and drama\\" crowd will be disappointed that they aren't more obviously emotive and colorful.  I am no uncritical Klemperer admirer, and I enjoy HIP-informed performances and any other interesting take on the classic masters.  But Klemperer remains a conductor I turn to again and again for stimulation and inspiration. His great accomplishment with Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven in particular was to produce un-Romantic performances that sound inevitable and \\"right\\"; sober and straightforward, yes, but also intellectually compelling and emotionally satisfying.  If you also admire Klemperer's way with the classics, the new DSD/SACD remastering makes his accomplishment sound with greater clarity and presence and I think you too will be happy to have these CDs.<br /><br />A couple of final notes.  These are stereo recordings that, in most cases, represent Klemperer's final studio productions of this music for EMI.  (Earlier EMI mono recordings of some of these symphonies have been reissued by the Testament label.)  As 'Unclehulot' points out in his comment below my review, this set includes Klemperer's earlier (1956) stereo recording of the G minor symphony (No. 40),  rather than the later (1960/1961) performance that EMI identifies in its liner note listing.  In the earlier recording, Klemperer's tempi are faster (even fierce) and the performance is more darkly dramatic. Unclehulot also points out that the earlier recording includes the Exposition repeat, omitted in the later performance. The downside of using that earlier recording in previous CD issues was the presence of a large amount of background (tape) hiss very characteristic of mastertape recordings in the early 1950s, and which previous CD remasterings removed only by compromising sonic presence. The new remastering provides a very satisfactory improvement for a classic recording that is now pushing 60 years old!  Final, final: Klemperer was a Manic Depressive and when he recorded during his manic phases his performances sometimes achieved a unique emotional incandescence, but at other times they just exhibit unpersuasive speed and violence. On the evidence presented here, I'd bet money that Klemperer was in one of his manic phases during the sessions that produced the \\"Linz\\" Symphony (No. 36).  It's a fine performance with quick tempi, but it just doesn't achieve the miraculous sense of rightness-in-proportion that the other performances in this set demonstrate again and again. IMHO.

0439023521|4.0|The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins is the first book in a trilogy. I will admit that I saw the movie first, but I always make sure to read the books of movies I see. No comparison will be drawn between the two.<br /><br />The main character, Katniss, is a skilled hunter who provides food for her mother and younger sister. In the world of Panem, The Hunger Games take place once a year and force one boy and girl between 12 and 18 years old from each of the twelve districts to fight to the death. A chain of events leads to the fact that Katniss, this year, is the so called tribute for District 12.<br /><br />The characters in this book are unique and diverse. Katniss is strong-willed and surrounded by a variety of characters that each have their own unique personality. I grew to love almost every one of them in some way or another.<br /><br />My one issue is that we did not get the chance to learn more about the other tributes, aside from very basic information. While I do understand that Katniss, herself, could not learn much about them or else it would ruin the game, I still feel it would have been nice to know a bit more.<br /><br />That aside, Suzanne Collins did a good job keeping me interested in the story. It was not packed with action at every moment; the start is much slower and there are moments of rest, despite the threat that looms overhead.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed this book and will be reading its sequel soon. Four out of five stars due to small things that I feel could have been improved upon, like getting to know the other tributes, but it's still a great book.<br /><br />I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good dystopian novel.

0307951529|4.0|As a person who is in the middle of a low capital start-up (more of a hobby-type learning experience at this point) I can relate to several of the stories found in this book.<br />This isn't a how-to book. To me, this is a book that shows it's possible to do what you want, and may provide a push to get you in motion.<br />It's so easy to think of all of the reasons why your idea or dream or concept won't work.  This book reminds us, story by story, that for lots of people, it CAN work. ...and if it doesn't, a $100 startup won't exactly break the bank, now will it?<br />The book is a fun read, and if you are thinking of starting a low capital business, this will get you thinking, maybe even moving.

B007URCTOG|4.0|I started watching this film with no expectations. I hadn't read the book from which the movie was adapted. I had only seen the preview. For a romance I found it surprisingly good. Channing Tatum's physique was offputting (and not in a good way - the guy looks like he has been taking too many steroids or working out way too much), but once I got past that aspect his character was heartbreakingly beautiful (corny statement I know, but watch the movie and you'll know what I mean).<br />This is a great date movie or a good film to watch when you are away from your sweetie (and missing him/her).<br />I know I won't be buying the film (it isn't something I would watch again and a again), but I would highly recommend renting it.

B002N7P23I|1.0|Skip the Amazon Instant Video version of this movie. It's dubbed. Kind of funny for the first 5 minutes if you're a fan of old-school kung fu movies, but not worth watching if you want to experience the impact of the original film.
B0064JV4LU|5.0|I didn't know a lot about this film heading into a sneak preview in Dallas last week, but left agog at this thrilling, fantastic piece of movie-making from co-directors  Olivier Nakache and &Eacute;ric Toledano.  It's the best film experience - no, the best theater-going experience - I've had in well some time.  I saw it with a keyed-up audience of Francophiles who had clearly heard the buzz and wanted to be there to see what has been called a 'cultural phenomenon' in Europe as it first hits US shores.<br /><br />Believe the hype.  Nakache and Toledano have constructed their film as a M&ouml;bius Strip - starting near to the end in seat-gripping introduction as co-protagonists Driss (Omar Sy in a groundbreaking C&eacute;sar-winning performance) and Philippe (François Cluzet - [[ASIN:B0031ZNGMA Tell No One]]) race a Maserati Quattroporte through the streets of late-night Paris.  Earth, Wind and Fire's \\"September\\" never sounded so good.  The directors then take us back to the start to show us how the two met.<br /><br />The film perfectly mixes comedy and poignancy.  Sy - a gifted physical and verbal comedian - had our audience convulsed, at times, with laughter.  The subject matter - dealing with quadriplegia - doesn't seem ripe for comedy, but the film conveys both Philippe's desire not to be pitied and Driss' guileless honesty.  He simply treats Philippe as he would anyone else.  He's never been trained to do anything different.<br /><br />I extend this entreaty to all mainstream movie-goers: lay down your prejudices and aversions to subtitled movies and see this film.  Don't miss out.  I'm sure Hollywood will re-make this film...and kill it.  Please see this original version.  No one will pull your man card.  You will not be disappointed.

B007DJUO8O|4.0|Since there has already been a detailed review of the individual tracks, I won't repeat the breakdown. I will say that the album did not disappoint, that's not to say it met the considerable expectations placed on it by fans and the artists themselves.<br /><br />I think the first half of the album is cogent and captivating, especially Drag Ropes and Hag. But I'm more of a soundscapes type person, so the dissonance and otherworldly orchestrations were welcomed. \\"Happy\\" is rather precious and seems like something transitional, while \\"Lock Howl\\" is interesting enough to keep your attention, though I think a hyperactive and intricate bassline would have made it even better. Akerfeldt's swan song \\"Ljudet Innan\\" is of course undeniably beautiful but it meanders a bit through a rather profligate time span. However, it does bring to mind Talk Talk's \\"Spirit of Eden\\" when Wilson takes over the vocals midway through.<br /><br />In summary, the atmospherics carry the disc, even though the minimal nature of the entire collaboration threatens its coherence, if that is something you could ever totally expect from these two on this type of \\"conflation\\". They land on their feet but not without some slippery moments. More interesting is whether or not there will be further offerings. I believe they left a bit on the table with Storm Corrosion, but \\"the truth that can now be told\\" is indeed a clever \\"manifold\\" of mellifluous, mawkish and at times even macabre manipulations of sound.
B001K3KK0Q|5.0|For some reason my wife and I had neither seen the movie nor read the book; we had both heard about the movie and the book for many years but had not taken the time to read or view it before. Last night we were looking over Amazon's streaming video library and decided, on an impulse, to watch \\"The Great Gatsby\\" and are very pleased to have made that decision.<br /><br />The movie has a different feeling to it from the very beginning; one gets the idea this movie is going to be different and one is correct in that assumption. The movie follows the lives of a small group who live privileged lives of wealth and ease; one is reminded of the British stories of the landed gentry who had more time and money than good sense.<br /><br />The story is handled in retrospect from the perspective of a young man named, Nick Carraway, played by Sam Waterston, who has moved from the Midwest to Long Island and lives in a small cottage next door to a wealthy, but mysterious man named Jay Gatsby, played by Robert Redford. The acting by the entire cast is effective and powerful and carries the viewer along on a ride not to be soon forgotten.<br /><br />We were both surprised at the ending which I'll not reveal here, but found the movie to be a worthwhile and memorable experience. I recommend it to the mature audience.
B003JSSPSY|1.0|I liked Season 1, but Season 2 bugged me.<br /><br />The biggest reason was that, if you get to the end of it, loose ends are left unresolved (probably with the idea that they would keep a bad guy in the picture for Season 3) and there's no plans for Season 3.  So, my biggest warning is this: IF YOU WATCH SEASON 2 BE FOREWARNED THAT YOU WILL NEVER, EVER FIND OUT IF THE BAD GUYS ARE FINALLY AND ULTIMATELY DEFEATED BECAUSE THERE'S NO NEXT SEASON.<br /><br />My second issue is, if you're like me, you want plots to make logical sense.  Having too many plot flaws messes up my enjoyment of a story so much that all I think about are the plot flaws and not the story.<br /><br />Here are the plot flaws (omitting plot spoilers):<br />-1-<br />The biggest plot flaw of all is the entire premise of Season 2: that the Keeper of the Underworld is trying to destroy all life.  Think about it... if you raise cattle for meat and you kill all of them, no more pregnancies = no more calves = no more cattle = no more meat.<br /><br />If the goal of the Keeper is to get as many souls as possible and he had any intelligence, he'd want the status quo: that generations grow, live and die and that the world is full of disease, war and natural disasters (which it certainly already is).  So, if the Keeper's goal is to kill all life, thereby stopping the cycle of generations and thereby stop having generation after generation go to him, he's an idiot because he'll end up with less souls long term!<br /><br />-2-<br />Fortunately, the stupidity of the Keeper is matched by the stupidity of the good guys.  Shortly into the season, Richard is unaccountably having headaches.  Three middle-aged women who are complete strangers appear to him and say that this is because he has magical powers and that he'll die of his headaches if they don't take him off to another world and train him to use his latent magic powers.<br /><br />So, what does he do?  Does he do something sensible like wait until he can talk to Zedd about all this (I mean, surely Zedd can train him to use his magic without him having to go off to another world and without him having to trust people he's never met)?  No!  He just trusts the three women and runs off with them to another world, leaving Zedd, Kaylan and his quest behind.<br /><br />PLOT SPOILER: I could forgive this if it wasn't for the fact that it turns out that he CAN'T trust them.  In fact, he ends up giving all of his magic to a bad guy in order to escape from them.  If he hadn't trusted them in the first place and just consulted Zedd, none of that would have happened.<br /><br />Yet, all of this and the consequences figure prominently in the rest of the season.  There's no sense of Richard being foolish and learning from his mistakes.  He's portrayed as just a straight up good guy who did what he \\"had\\" to do, when he didn't have to.<br /><br />-3-<br />Another piece of stupidity is from Zedd the wizard.  The good guys are often attacked by bad girls called Mord Sith, who absorb magic.  So, Zedd simply never attacks them and sometimes even ends up getting successfully threatened by them into doing something he doesn't want to do.<br /><br />Hasn't he ever heard of lateral thinking?  Who says he has to cast a spell on them?  Surely a Wizard of the First Order (which he is) could, say, make the grass grab their feet or make the ground swallow them or something (neither of which would be direct attacks).  Or... maybe he could summon spirits to attack them (also not a direct attack).  I'm just brainstorming, but I'd think he could come up with better ideas yet.<br /><br />Even if he had no way of dealing with them, we know that he often turns invisible.  Yet, when they capture him or manage to put an agiel (their torture weapons) to his throat, he doesn't bother.  Why doesn't he just turn invisible, run away and then return to help his friends when the opportunity presents itself (or wreak havoc with the Mord Sith while invisible, like tripping them with a stick or something)?<br /><br />-4-<br />Okay, now I'm encroaching on plot spoilers, so I can only say so much.  There's a spell that Zedd casts in the second to last episode, which he has to undo.  The problem is that undoing it makes no sense, if you stop and think about it.  I'll just say that if you do X and then undo Y, it doesn't undo X, yet somehow the vicarious logic of the plot tries to get us to believe that by undoing Y, Zedd can undo X, even though it doesn't follow logically at all.<br /><br />-5-<br />In the last episode, of course, the Keeper is the ultimate enemy who has to be reckoned with.  The thing is that the Keeper has a gigantic opportunity to win by doing something really obvious (again, I won't spoil the plot), and yet he stupidly does something else that he hopes will assure him victory, but which isn't nearly as likely to succeed as the other thing (hint for those who have seen Season 2: if your enemy can succeed if you go in the vicinity of X, it's typically a good idea to go in the opposite direction, not just to vicariously decide to go to X for no reason other than that the writers need you to).<br /><br />But, then, we already knew that the Keeper was stupid (see plot flaw 1).<br /><br />Season 1 ended satisfactorily with Richard defeating Darken Rahl.  It should have stayed that way.  My advice is watch Season 1 and not Season 2.  That way, you'll end the nice, fairly logical plotting of Season 1 with the epic hero victorious instead of having to slog through 22 episodes of nonsense just to have loose-ends not tied up and never find out what happens.
B007HWTQQ8|5.0|A very powerfull movie that will leave you breathless. You embark in Jesus Christ last 12 living hours before he is crusified a very very powerful movie.
0345803485|1.0|I just do not understand how this book could even be thought of as a good read, well when you think about how easily people are influenced who wants to be left out of the in crowd. Enough comments have been left on this poorly written piece that I need not comment further other than all this is is a rather poorly done dime store filth novel that media attention.
6305428042|5.0|Funny and enjoying movie for the whole family to watch. My grandchildren loved it and they are asking for one to take home
B0018QQQK8|3.0|As Sparks writes more and more novels the romantic characters begin to feel a little flat while the revolving story/tragedy around them comes to the foreground. This is not bad as a story to push the romance back, except let's face it, these novels are about the romance. As the characters moved through the book I had the same feeling about them in the end that I had in the beginning. The ending actually only irritated me more, but I will not give that away here.<br /><br />I will, however, give away one spoiler from the book that was actually a glaring plot hole that somehow was never caught?<br /><br />\\"And before I knew it, the invasion had started. I finally got around to sending it, but the letter was eventually returned to me unopened. Drake died in the first week of the invasion.\\"<br /><br />If you do not have a basic idea of the story this might mean nothing to you, but when you get to this point in the novel, perhaps a little over halfway through, this is an outrage. Suddenly there are other questions and none of them get answered because it never occurs to our female protagonist that this would be impossible.<br /><br />To explain the spoiler a bit: Logan has a picture of Beth that he found. The statement is her explaining sending the picture out, and then eventually getting back the letter (with the picture in it) returned in the mail. Impossible.<br /><br />Great story with a lot of iffy situations, especially considering Logan's time as a Marine. The accidents, his good luck, all seems to come with a little too much glossing.<br /><br />Sadly, this novel left me wanting. It was predictable and a little flat, and still it was an excellent story. I just wish the story had been fleshed out more and the characters had grown, at least a little. Logan's growing happened before he came to Hampton and Beth never really seems to grow up.<br /><br />Reasons to Read:<br /><br />- It is by Nicholas Sparks<br /><br />- Interesting story<br /><br />- Ben and Nana arecute and hilarious<br /><br />- It still has that spark of Sparks<br /><br />Reasons not to Read:<br /><br />- Nothing terribly new<br /><br />- Huge plot hole<br /><br />- Clayton, Beth's ex-husband, makes you question how likeable Beth really is
0345803485|1.0|I am really upset that I spent money on this book. I would have loved to borrow this book through Kindle from a friend, but it wasn't \\"sharable\\". Honestly, I had a lot of friends that recommended this book to me. I read a lot-loved Twilight! So I was thinking if I can get over the writing in Twilight books, I could handle this. Basically, I don't think this book was good, at all! The characters were weak and the main character Ana was ridiculously annoying and stupid. I am fine with erotica, but this was erotica surrounded by an awful plot. I would not recommend this book and wish I could get my money back!

1451648537|4.0|I listened to the audio version of this book (all 20 or so hours of it), and was stunned at the amount of detail that was included in some portions of this book.  For instance, many of Jobs meeting with top managers at Apple were described in almost excruciating detail:  who was in attendance, who wrote on the white board, whether Steve Jobs had shoes on during the meeting, etc. (I'm not exaggerating about the shoes--it seems that Jobs was often barefoot, even in very formal settings).<br /><br />Some very personal yet somehow very mundane details of Jobs' life were meticulously detailed in this book as well.  The author describes Jobs' eating habits and what he ate during dozens of meals.  Many pages of this book are dedicated to describing actual restaurant meals that Jobs ate, how he liked the food, etc.<br /><br />While getting bogged down in exacting detail about Jobs' food preferences, clothing choices, etc. (the book even tells us how many black turtlenecks Job had custom made and which couture manufacturer made them for him), the book somehow manages to gloss over most of the more meaningful personal aspects of his life.<br /><br />However, using the information that he gained from many sources, including dozens of visits with Jobs himself, the author has painted a fairly vivid and well-crafted portrait of Jobs.
B00371V6SE|4.0|easy read, very simple story but did make me want to go and see the movie. Enjoyed reading this novel of a love affair. Hard to imagine Zac Effron in this role as it reads like someone older

The movie itself seems way too fake and too scripted, and ugh especially Carrie Underwood's lines and her acting also seems fake as heck!! Soooooooooo read the REAL Bethany Hamilton's story!!!!!!!!!!! :D :D.
B0063IH60K|4.0|fun app to play easy to use it has help get us through several long waits. would recommend to others
B005LAIH3G|5.0|This movie is everything you would expect from Disney Studios.  It has 1st class special effects, plenty of action, lavish sets, and a wonderful story.  It is based on characters created by the author of Tarzan and countless other classics.  This is the type of movie you'll want to watch over and over.
0439023521|5.0|This entire series is beautifully written and terribly addicting. Each chapter leaves you wanting to continue to the next. I would actually end in the middle of a chapter just so that I could rest easy! Fantastic series. Strongly recommend.
B006QVRUS2|1.0|All the preview movies before the main movie starts sounds fine<br />but when the actual movie starts its like 5 doors have been closed behind the TV even at full volume.<br />Only a hum can be heard.<br /><br />Whats up with this.<br />Care to explain anyone?
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I love the series and its probably one of the best fantasy novels ever written.<br />This book just kept dragging and dragging and dragging and.....etc.<br /><br />No real ACTION: So you would expect some dragons flying, killing and taking over a couple of cities. Nope!! not gonna happen!!<br /><br />Honestly if it was not for Tyrion's chapters and the fact that I was sick in bed and had nothing else to do, it would have been a boring read.
B0025UHKNS|2.0|Summary :- I've got this as a replacement to the 305. I wish I had bought the 305 again..<br /><br />I'll start with the Pros:-<br /><br />It can be used as a normal watch as its not to big and cumbersome.<br />The Backlight is fantastic in the dark.<br />Its fairly quick at finding its location<br /><br />The Cons are :-<br /><br />I have found this product really frustration as itemed below :-<br /><br />1 Touch Bevel :- Fine for indoor use or fine days but if you don't let the rain stop you from running then be prepared for real frustrations. The bevel cannot handle the wet and if you want to change things or monitor things on the go it doesn't work (nb the watch does continues to work you will not lose your run data). The \\"manual\\" suggest you wipe the watch dry..How can you do that when your damp as well!!<br /><br />2 WiFi usb  This will be a bit of a frustration if you are not a computer savvy (luckily I am). Give me hard wired USB anyday as per 305<br /><br />3 \\"Course\\" screens  are very basic beyond usefulness. If you have a 305 and you can follow a course using the black track line on a basic map which is useful.<br /><br />I am in the process of returning this product and will try to get a 305 or another product that doesn't use \\"touch\\" screens/bevels

B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Well executed game with nice graphics but after a while you get sick and tired os shooting birds at pigs. my 3  year old and 10 year old used to love this but after a month or 2 they got bored and just went on to the next game. Itsagood thing this one was free because it only lasted a short time.  I only recommend this to people with a large attention span.
B004LWZW9C|1.0|I paid $3.99 for the live stream; if it had been more I would have been angry.  This movie was syrupy predictable and trite. It was actually kind of boring and I found myself wondering how much time was left.  Hillary Swank and Robert D were the bright stars showing the most depth in this shallow pond. I like the concept of overlapping cross stories (like Crash, but lacking similar compelling story lines).  There was a surprise/mystery ending which was somewhat ruined by an unrealistic goofball act. The outtakes at the end were the funniest and most interesting things about this movie.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|Seeing this book listed as a children's books and hearing reviews of the movies, I decided to read the series for myself.  Once you complete the first book, you just have to find out what happens to the main characters.  That said, it is definitely not a book I would want my children reading.  I think this book would be most appropriate for ages 20 and up.  I loaned my Kindle to a friend, a retired English teacher, and she gave it back the next time I saw her.  She said it was way too disturbing even for her.
0345803485|2.0|All very good points here, but I feel compelled to add my 3 cents. As a female who was in a very similar relationship, (man with a damaged soul/tragic life), I can tell you that these real stories rarely have a happy ending. I think the \\"danger\\" in this type of book lies in the romanticism of a male's control over a woman. Yes, this book is fiction, and yes, one of course has the choice whether to read it or throw in in the trash. But it opened a healed scar of mine when I read the female character plead fearfully \\"Please don't hit me\\", among other supplications. There is nothing sexy or desirable about a man who \\"stalks\\" you and tries to control your every move; I still bear the scars of this lesson. I just hope a wrong message isn't put out there for women. Just for the record, I am avid reader of romance, erotica, as well as other genres, and I can honestly tell you that there is A LOT better out there! At times I felt like I was reading something a woman with the composition capacity of a 12 year old wrote. Shades of Grey is a fantasy, one that can leave that happy ending feeling, but it dances around a very dangerous premise.
B006QVRVJK|1.0|the funny thing is, I turned this movie off at 50 minutes and was going to give it 2 stars... the next day i turned it back on and it stunk worse.<br /><br />hey, polanski is good, but this crap is not.  script was so artificial,and in a bad way, i assure you.  everyone is so over the top... maybe rolan has bee living in a senile dream world lately.  the casting is good, but the script is gar-bage-ola!  pe-ew!

B007MDB71O|5.0|I have read every book that Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote.  That is almost 70 stories.  I always wanted to see a version of Tarzan like Burroughs wrote him.  It has never happened.  When I heard that John Carter was coming out, I was thrilled.  It is a story that should be put on the big screen.  I am glad that it finally did.  I had a great time watching it and experiencing it in the theater.  Is it exactly like the books?  No, but the basic story is there and the cast of characters is there.  It really upset me when Disney dissed their own movie and that it didn't turn out to be a blockbuster.  I do hope that they do another one.  I will definitely buy the Blu-Ray!
B0079R8KXG|5.0|This is not the highest quality case I have for my Fire. In fact I have 3 other cases for it. Yet this is the one I turn to most often. It is slim, not bulky nor weighty, and it fits perfectly. There is something about the texture of the case that appeals to me. I love the strap that goes around front (this is exactly like my [[ASIN:B003DZ165W Kindle Lighted Leather Cover, Black (Fits Kindle Keyboard)]] which I adore).<br /><br />This is easy to fold back and it doesn't flop around at all. It's a little more orange red than I would like (I prefer deeper red colors) but I'm not about to have a drama about it. The stand works o.k. as long as you don't touch the Fire. So for me it's not helpful. I've had a couple cases that had stands and they never seem to work that well so I didn't remove a star. If this matters greatly to you chose a different case.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I'm about half way through this blu-ray box set now, just received yesterday. As someone that has watched the show and has read through the book series I am a big fan of the story. Theres enough said about the story line, so I'll leave my review based on the quality itself of the blu-ray set.<br /><br />TV broadcasts even those labeled as HD or the same amount of pixels can still differ in quality based on the video compression used to format the movies. The bottom line is the picture quality in this boxset definitely surpases even what you may have viewed in the televised high def broadcast from HBO. Blu-ray is the best quality version of this series.

B005FISBTO|5.0|can't believe all the negative reviews of this season...to me it was the next logical step for dex to struggle with the question of religion, mainly because of fatherhood and wanting to do the right thing for his son., but mostly because of the influence of Harrison's nanny...whom i personally LOVED in season 5.  the notion of romance w Deb? thaat was an awesome twist....she is my favorite character next to Dex and maybe thats why no other man can \\"measure up\\" to her staandards in the last couple seasons... who knows!?  i will still wear out the dvds of seasons 1-5 until 6 comes out on dvd and season 7 begins on showtime.

0465092764|4.0|I actually thoroughly enjoyed this book. It took me on a very clear journey on the development of the standard model and the personalities involved with it in the first part of the book. I have to thank the author for pointing me in the direction of Hermann Weyl's \\"Symmetry\\", which I enjoyed very, very much. I am glad that he did not dumb down the physics too much in the book; I understood much more about particle theory after reading the first part of the book. Woit is a careful writer, never engaging in ad hominem attacks on those he disagrees with, and does not behave like an egotistical jerk like some figures in the field do lately.<br /><br />The latter third part of the book is admittedly contentious where it gets very critical about string theory, but I always support the critical voice to be heard. It may well be the case that string theory is simply a theory before its time, however.

Sade is timeless,she transcends time and space and captures you with her beauty grace,and seductivness.Sade is true to her art,she is a living legend. On stage she wowed us,not by flashy get ups or rounchy dances,but with her brillance of artistry. The best concert of 2011,or should I say, \\"The best concert I have ever seen in my entire life\\".

B0052VUNHC|3.0|As my title says, I have mixed feelings on this book.  I can not stand violence or fighting, and obsessive, needy overly protective guys diver me nuts, so Travis is most definitely not \\"my kind of guy.\\" (though I do know plenty of girls that love that kind of thing)  He was well written though and had enough redeeming qualities to make him a little bit likable. Abby is way too back and forth on everything and treats most of the people around her pretty badly.  It is kind of strange to like a book when you don't like the main characters, but I actually did enjoy this book.  It is by no means one of my favorites, but it was an enjoyable read that stuck with.<br /><br />I liked the fact that it was 'gritty' I tend to lean towards books about younger people (probably because I am old and boring now) but as an adult it is annoying to read books that feel the need to be squeaky clean and always have to teach a good lesson.  Just because a book is about people younger then 25 does not mean that it needs to be geared towards 13 year old kids.  I also liked that they were in college and not high school.  I have never understood why so many books, and shows, have to focus on high school kids rather then college aged characters, where sex and drinking are not as inappropriate.<br /><br />This book was about two totally screwed up people with a very screwed up relationship.  I would by no means hold up Travis and Abby as some kind of super couple, or an example to young women of what true love is all about.  They are a train wreck and it was fun to be a spectator to their dysfunction.  I found myself not rooting for, or against their relationship, it was just fun to sit back and watch it all unfold.<br /><br />I also like the flow (or lack there of) of the book.  A lot of people have complained about it and some parts were awkward and a bit rushed, and others were drug out too long, so it could have used some cleaning up, however it was kind of nice to break away from the perfect outline format that most books follow (slow build up, exciting climax, and quick wrap up)  I was never really sure where the story was going, so it kept me on my toes, which was kind of refreshing.  I do think the editing needs to be tighter as far as grammar and punctuation are concerned.  When people are paying money for a book it should be professional and those errors should be cleaned up.<br /><br />In conclusion, this was by no means one of my all time favorite books, I would consider it more of a guilty pleasure, but it was enjoyable and worth the price and my time to read it.ct outline format that most books follow (slow build up, exciting climax, and quick wrap up)  I was never really sure where the story was going, so it kept me on my toes, which was kind of refreshing.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|I debated on weather to purchase this for my phone because of said compatibility problems with Motorola devices. I own the steam copy on my PC and really wanted this on the go. So after wading through the reviews and Google searches I just decided to buy and give it a go. I've wasted far more than $3 in the past and even on my modest budget it's not a huge loss.  I'm pleased to say that it works perfectly on my (U.S. Cellular) Motorola Electrify. Loads fast, saves properly, never crashes. I easily have 10 hours into the game with no problems at all. So if you own the Electrify, give it a shot! It's the best $3 bucks you will spend today.<br /><br />Game Review:<br /><br />Not much to say that hasn't already been covered. However I would like to bring one point to the table. I enjoy playing this version of the game far more than on my PC. The touchscreen gameplay really adds allot to the overall game experience. Sound and graphics seem better to me than on the Nintendo DS as well. And it'll cost you $17.00 less! So if you enjoy a fun and challenging game on the go give this a try :)

0307951529|5.0|For me this happened when I read Tribes and realized that the way business and marketing works had changed and most people didn't realize it. My life's work is a result of the change in thinking I experienced while reading that book.<br /><br />A few weeks ago I read Chris Guillebaue's new book, The $100 Startup.  I'm convinced this book is going to do for thousands of people what Tribes did for me.  It's going to change the way they look at business and work...forever.<br /><br />In The $100 Startup Chris shares story after story of people around the globe who've started businesses based on their passion and providing value to others.  He shares the story of Benny Lewis an Irishman with a knack for learning languages who left an engineering career to travel the world and teach people how to learn languages using his methods. He describes how Michael Hanna was laid-off from his professional job and started a mattress store with a unique twist...he delivers people's mattresses by bicycle. One day he realized he hadn't worn his suit in two years so he carried it out to his bike and delivered it to Goodwill.<br /><br />This book isn't just a series of inspiring stories it's also a blueprint for how to start your own business. If you've ever wondered if you can be one of the lucky ones who get's to spend every day making a living doing something you love, the answer is a resounding yes, and this book will show you how. You'll find yourself and your passion in it's pages...and you may never be the same.

0307352145|5.0|*A full summary of this book is available here: [[ASIN:B00HMD4VF8 An Executive Summary of Susan Cain's 'Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking']]<br /><br />Being the quieter, more reserved type, introverts are not as inclined as others to broadcast just who they are and what makes them tick, much less honk their own horns. However, given that Western culture has increasingly pushed introverts aside, and is intent on celebrating their opposite, it is high time that introverts stepped out of character, made themselves heard, and proclaimed to the world that they have much to offer indeed. This is the campaign that Susan Cain launches in her new book, `Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking'.<br /><br />Cain begins her account by way of establishing that Western culture has increasingly adopted an `Extrovert Ideal,' in which louder, bolder, more ebullient and risk-friendly individuals are valued over and above the quieter, more reserved, reflective and heed-friendly ones. While Western culture has a long history of favoring the extrovert, Cain argues that this bias has steepened since the industrial revolution, and particularly in the past century as the West has become ever-more urbanized and commercial. Over the course of this time-frame, Cain argues, a Culture of Personality, perhaps best represented by the motivational guru Tony Robins, has come to replace a Culture of Character, best represented by such figures as Abraham Lincoln.<br /><br />Cain's intention here is not to put-down extroverts, or to say that they are inferior to introverts. Rather, her argument is that the latter have an important role to play in many areas of society that is now often overlooked. For one, the introvert's greater willingness to listen to others and their input makes them better leaders than is generally recognized. Second, their heed-friendly temperaments serves to better protect them (and those around them) against dangerous situations, and makes them particularly valuable in such professions as financial investing, where undue risk is not only known to get individuals in trouble, but entire nations, and even the entire international community. Third, the fact that introverts tend to have a sharpened moral sense makes them well-suited to fill the role of the social conscience of society, which is often valuable in protecting the downtrodden, and also in saving societies from their own recklessness.<br /><br />Finally, the added thoughtfulness and persistence of introverts, and their heightened capacity to work independently, often gives them an edge in creative enterprises such as art and technological innovation, as well as in more intellectual industries such as science and engineering. Indeed, Cain insists that there is plenty of evidence to indicate that working independently is an important part of having and developing the best ideas, not only for introverts but for everyone. This helps explain why the most creative people tend to be introverted, and also serves as an argument in favor of tempering the emphasis on groupthink and collaborative work that is currently running rampant through our schools and businesses.<br /><br />While introverts often have more to offer than many recognize, it is also the case that their sensitive nature tends to make them more fragile than others; as such, they are particularly susceptible to having their talents stifled and even snuffed out before they have had the time to develop. For this reason, Cain argues, it is especially important for parents and educators to know the best approaches when it comes to both raising and educating the quieter type, and the author makes a concerted effort to address these issues here. In particular, Cain emphasizes just how vital it is to encourage and nurture the introvert's peculiar talents, and to be patient in dealing with their inwardness. Having said this, Cain does not advocate giving in to this inwardness entirely, as she stresses the importance of challenging the introvert to come out of their shell as much as they are able, in order that they may learn to make their voices heard, and to get along in a more extrovert-friendly world. In connection with this, Cain argues that it is not only possible, but often healthy and beneficial for introverts to stretch themselves to be more extroverted on occasion--especially when it is in the name of a goal that they value, and as long as it is not overdone.<br /><br />Altogether, the work is well researched and very insightful, and there is much to be learned here about the quieter among us for the extroverted and introverted alike--and also much to help the latter feel more comfortable in their own skin (thankfully without being an exercise in self-congratulation for them).

0316069884|5.0|Thank you, Jonathan Safran Foer, for writing this incredible investigation of factory farming. Like the author, I've been mostly vegetarian for years, eating turkey and fish with no concern about dairy products. After reading this book, which details everything many people will never want to know about where our food comes from, I am \\"mostly vegan\\" now. For those who eat only turkey believing it's somehow exempt from the problems associated with industrial beef and poultry farming, the surprising truth is it's actually worse. This is just one of many things you'll learn from Safran's brilliant and enlightening tome. This book, a comprehensive look at what it means to eat meat, is extremely well-written, engaging, and informative. Much like the author's novel ~Everything is Illuminated~, I couldn't put it down, and I feel somehow better for having read it. While the truth presented in these pages is quite disturbing, it's empowered me to effect change, and for that I am sincerely grateful.

All of them are connected and the thread of their connection is their passion for flowers and the meaning of flowers.
0452289963|3.0|Tolle has a common slant on life on earth today: he's against war, violence and oppression.  Mos of all, he opposes the human ego, comparing it to a fatal cancer and blaming it for all our bad acts. It robs us of kindness and selflessness.  It drives us to \\"win\\" every encounter in which we are engaged.  His book opens with a lecture on man's warlike nature and shifts attention for the reasoning of warlike persons.  Everything they encounter they want to win or overcome.  This may be true.  I have seen egomaniacs intimidate individuals and crowds into feelings of shame for not wanting to \\"win\\" more than they do.  Sports coaches are good at that. Politicians, too. Egomaniacs always want to have the last word, which is why I write this after I read the book. Later I heard him read the text on audio. He sounds like a mildly puzzled professor waiting for his mom to find his meerschaum pipe while his tea cools in a long Russian crystal glass.

But if you go carefully, and even then not that slow, and pay attention to arms and tiny bends in the decal they wont rip. We applied to a white flat wall and they stuck great. a month after we repainted and stuck them on the other side of the room to my son's blue glossy painted wall and the moving went great. a week later they were moved back to my daughter's pink glossy walls and again moved and re-stuck great! I was concerned the gloss paint would make them fall off but it didn't. Love this brand, we have 3 different sets (also bob the builder and Phineas and Ferb) with no complaints at all.

B0006V6TMG|5.0|Jesse Cook's last studio release Nomad, released back in 2003, was two years in the making. The results were phenomenal and the album by this reviewer was described as his most defining moment to date. Montreal is a live recording that in some ways was 10 years in the making considering that it encompasses his entire recording catalog that began back in 1995. And without a doubt, Montreal equals and probably exceeds the achievement of his prior effort making this the new standard not only for Cook but arguably anyone who wishes to document his or her achievements live.<br /><br />Opening with the atmospheric \\"Beloved\\" with eastern chants, surging drums and percussion, the audience is already in a frenzy as Cook arrives on the stage. Merging right into the memorable \\"Rattle And Burn\\", the only track taken from his 1998 effort Vertigo, the listener knows that they are in for an indulging concert. Jesse wastes no time in making full use of his axe, plucking his strings at an exceptional speed. The beauty of Cook is that while he is technically brilliant he never replaces his pyrotechnic workouts at the expense of a gorgeous melody. Jump forward and checkout the bouncy but almost folksy feel of \\"Breeze From Saintes Maries\\". It is sequenced back to back with the energetic calypso pulsation of \\"Jumpstart\\", which includes the percussion repartee of Paul Antonio and Art Avalos. And judging by the response to Cook and company, the crowd is already in overdrive and in total syncopation with the performance.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the moody introduction of \\"Luna Llena\\" swindles the crowd into a quiet moment. Starting off slowly the composition culminates with a guitar solo that will only have you wondering \\"How did he do that?\\" Affixed with the sultry violin work of Chris Church, this track will leave you gasping for air. Fortunately, the remainder of the album continues this trend, giving the listening very little time to take that big deep breath, as Cook and the band continue to drown you in a sea of exhilarating performances.<br /><br />Speaking of temperamental moments, there is also \\"Closer To Madness\\" that clocks in well over seven minutes. Once again the Eastern themes are prominent making for one of the many ecstatic moments on Montreal. It is also a good time for Cook to introduce the band that deserves the accolades considering the obvious group effort that is present. But none are more prevalent than those found on the magical moment of \\"Mario Takes A Walk\\" which also includes the bombastic percussion and drum work of the Samba Squad. The thunderous drums are so huge it takes on attributes of a carnival atmosphere.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the album closes out with one full vocal track \\"Fall At Your Feet\\" that features Danny Wilde of The Rembrandts. Danny was not available for the concert so his vocals were added after the fact courtesy of technological wonders Speaking of the production aspect, the album as per all of his past endeavors, is tasked to Cook. Clearly his gifts are not just limited to performing and composing, as the quality of the production is exceptional.<br /><br />With a total of five studio albums to his name, Cook has an impressive body of work that requires an equally impressive live document to commemorate such past achievements. Montreal not only completes this task but it begs the question of why you would not want to be part of a true live experience of the blistering and exotic music of Jesse Cook. This will be one oversight that this reviewer will need to correct as soon as possible.e to drown you in a sea of exhilarating performances.<br /><br />Speaking of temperamental moments, there is also \\"Closer To Madness\\" that clocks in well over seven minutes.

B0050DIWFC|4.0|I had mixed feelings about this book. The plot was interesting:a prosecutor who has to deal with the reality that his teenage son has been arrested for the murder of a school mate. It did drag in places as we wait with the family for the trial and trying to keep things together. But the trial gets interesting and then there is twist after twist after twist that I did not see coming. So some of the middle could have been cut but overall a really solid novel with tragic moments.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Believe it or not this was the first book of Stephen's King's that I've ever read and I wasn't disappointed. I've never been very into the horror genre, which is why I shied away from King's books, but this one seemed different so I decided to give it a try. It's the perfect mixture of history, science fiction, and drama, and King creates characters that you can't help but love. You would expect a book such as this to have a predictable ending, but this is not the case at all. After reading this book, I'm certain to give King's other novels a read! I highly recommend this book to anyone!!

B000002JNJ|5.0|Cowboys From Hell was the groundbreaking, and now legendary, re-invention of Pantera, who had previously been a make-up, lipstick, and hairspray glam metal band.  Having gone virtually nowhere with that angle, Phil Anselmo, Diamond Darrell (later to be known as Dimebag), Rex (formerly known as Rex Rocker), and Vinnie Paul took the band in a heavier direction, laying the foundation for their highly influential groove metal style that basically ended the thrash era of American metal.  The songs on CFH still retain some touches of their earlier sound, such as Phil's occasional high-pitched vibrato, but mostly show the great diversity Pantera would continue to incorporate and build upon.  The title track, Psycho Holiday, and Medicine Man are fine examples of the bouncy, mid-tempo groove that spawned the entire metalcore subgenre.  Primal Concrete Sledge and Message In Blood show slower, grinding and churning grooves that are heavy, but not quite thrash.  Domination and The Art of Shredding tend more toward thrash, with faster riffing and drums.  Nothing on this album really sounds quite like the crunch of the next few releases that would define their identity and go on to influence every band in metal, from the underground thrash bands to the heavyweights of the genre, like Metallica.  CFH is more of a bridge between their past and what they were trying to become.  But it has tons of groove, killer riffs and solos, and a shift into more aggressive music and vocals.  Anyone who is a fan of metal and doesn't already have this should correct that mistake and pick it up.  Pantera was one of the most important bands ever to emerge in the history of heavy music.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I finally purchased this book after hearing soooo much about it. I mean, even Dr. Oz had a show about it! I got through half of it quickly, but had to force myself to finish the second half.  The writing was amatuer and repetitive, and the plot predictable.  I almost couldn't bare to read about Ana's inner goddess one more time! And all the eye rolling, lip biting and oh my's...so annoying. This book was nothing but a glorified romance novel.  I've read some Nora Roberts etc. and cannot see how this book is any better or deserves a bestseller status.
B007DJUO8O|5.0|Steven Wilson and Mikael Akerfeldt created a beast of an album together! Truly progressive in the best sense of the word. Those of you who are expecting some kind of hybrid of metal and prog from this collaboration would be  disappointed with the album. The only two records that bear a resemblance in some parts to Storm Corrosion are Opeth Heritage and Steven Wilson Grace For Drowning. All in all, the fruit of this collaboration is a totally different kind of record from anything that Steven or Mikael have done before. It has its unique atmosphere and sound. Two words that best describe the music here are: Strange And Beautiful. I think Steven and Mikael described it this way and they are absolutely correct. Storm Corrosion is not the record to listen casually or as a background noise. It demands your full attention. If there is such a thing as a \\"headphone album\\" than Storm Corrosion is a perfect example of it. Since I got it I can't help but listen to it every day and slowly fall in love with it. Another strong  side of this record is the cover! What a wonderful and surreal image that perfectly mirrors the mood of the music. Even the covers for Heritage and Grace For Drowning did not impress me as much as the cover for Storm Corrosion. I am glad that I ordered it in a vinyl and a poster (that is going to be framed). What else to say? If you are open minded and \\"buy into\\" the artist as individual and not just certain sound or album than this record is for you. Don't make a mistake and compare it to Steven's or Mikael's previous work. It is a completely new journey that deserves the clean slate. In the words of great Frank Zappa : \\"A mind is like a parachute. It doesn't work if it is not open.\\" Storm Corrosion is a work of art! Can't wait for what happens next with this collaboration.
0345803485|1.0|A few friends insisted I read Fifty Shades of Grey.  I am an avid reader and choose carefully so I do not waste my time. Because a friend I respect pushed me, I read about 1/3 of it and then the last three-four chapters. I could not go any further because I found the characters unbelievable and the plot unsatisfying. However, that said I had to ask myself ~ What is it that American women are finding so compelling in these two characters and why is this book becoming such a sought after novel?  I was struggling with that idea and finally came up with a theory. Many women can no longer FEEL what they want to feel as a woman.  In our world, communication is generally by e-mail, text, sometimes by phone but not much, with very little time for one-on-one relationships; there is often a lack of closeness with our family and extended family members and friends. We are no longer together, but due to various reasons, we've become set apart from others to a large degree. Therefore, detachment seems to be the word that best describes what is happening to us.  We work, take care of kids or family members, work some more, take care of the house, shop for consumables, and then the day is gone. Lucky are those who have time to meet friends or have some sort of relationships outside of work or home.  Partners are in a similar rat-trap so there is often little time for each other it appears. So women especially, since many do most of the work in and out of the home, are becoming more and more alone and perhaps lonely.  Women who do not have a partner but want someone in their life may find this type of sex to be exciting; perhaps they may think that \\"something is better than nothing.\\" I sincerely hope not. This book may exemplify that feeling of detachment and \\"aloneness.\\"  Perhaps being noticed and swept up by a man provides us with a way in which to get any sort of attention, no matter how self-deprecating it may be.  I guess all of us want to be \\"swept off our feet\\" by someone, however, unless S&M is an actual lifestyle already, I find it difficult to believe that sweeping a woman off her feet would also mean being hung by her feet while being spanked or caned. How sad a statement it is for the American woman.  (Evidentaly the British women are appalled by this writer and are not buying the book.) So go figure -- What is your theory? Why are the women of America loving this book, discussing it and unashamed that they find it exciting and well written. (I have not even addressed that issue yet!)  I'm not only baffled and confused, but I'm also concerned and worried.
0345803485|1.0|I'm on page 118 of this horrible crap and I'm contemplating on whether to finish the rest. I'm a single woman, attractive, and I've had the fantasy of a Christian Grey type sort of character. What disturbs me most about this character is his control issues. He's also a bit of a stalker in his pursuit of Ana. Anastasia seems very stupid to me.  Another thing, how was she able to orgasm when losing her virginity???<br />I'm just irritated at reading this book. The first sex scene was not that great. I'm not into the whole BDSM scene so I'm not really sure if I should keep reading. I might as well be a writer if this crap is a bestseller.

Waits had done his time in rundown hotels and one night stands, been through his debut album, Closing Time, and was finally street seasoned enough to get it right. All the hallmarks of his style were here, songs that ached of love and loss, sparse jazz arrangements, and his growling beatnik vocal phrasings. Together these traits created a cult following that spoke reverently about his work, and shared his albums between friends like secret rituals of the rite of passage. Waits knew what it was like to be conspicuously miserable, and could portray it in his songs like liquid moonlight dripping out of the sky. New Coat of Paint opens things up with a regressing back beat that spits you out into the street corner looking to score a slight bit of affection with a girl bar hoping at your side, \\"You wear a dress baby, I'll wear a tie, we'll laugh at that old blood shot moon in that burgundy sky.\\" Then San Diego Serenade predisposes you into a relationship that's better the further the view gets in the rear view mirror and begs the listener to question why they didn't look back until it was too late. Semi Suite takes the listener inside a truck driver's world as he views his life through pain soaked excuses of everyday wear and tear relationships. It's filled to the brim with the point of view of his lady friend wanting to pull away but always there when he returns. The relationship battles Waits writes about he must of seen a thousand times in late night rundown joints where the stories flowed fasted than the alcohol and he paid attention and drank them down with a memory only he could digest. When Shiver Me Timbers sets sail we see that Waits can write about relationships from the perspective of many working class men, truckers, men of the sea, busboys, and even bums. He met every one of them and endeared his self to them for these stories, he knew his people better than any politician could ever dream of. The highlights of the album is Waits' zigzagging bass back beat driven hitchhikers jazz poem, Diamonds on my Windshield. The song oozes beatnik cool as Waits finger snaps his way through the song as if he's catching the next ride himself. Don't worry you'll be on the ride too. (Looking For) The Heart of Saturday Night is a timepiece drama that reflects the Saturday night ritual every red blooded American male dreams of fulfilling. Waits I'm assuming had this one down pat. Talk about dead ends in life, Fumblin' With The Blues is like loserville 101, it's all so easy to start it's just the finishing that's the damn hard part to create every weekend 52 times a year. Please Call Me, Baby is a bit more sentimental that the other songs here as Waits does his best Frank Sinatra thing, he sings, \\"If I exercise my devils well my angles my leave too, when they leave they're so hard to find.\\" Depot, Depot brings us into the bus station as Waits watches the people come and go. Did this guy ever go home in 1974 or was he just a street bum himself? By the time Drunk on The Moon hits you, you have surrendered, a few beers in and feeling lonely as hell even in a crowd. The album closes with, The Ghosts of Saturday Night (After Hours At Napoleone's Pizza House) which takes the listener on a late night excursion of observational destitution that began with dreams but ends the same every time with, \\"Leaving the town in the keeping of the one who is sweeping up the Ghosts of Saturday Night.\\" The album is best served during late nights, reflective thinking, and tends to sound best when you're on the bottom of life instead of the top. Music doesn't get any cooler than this, will never be hipper than this, and for all intense and purposes will never be as free to roam the late night American byways of days gone by, ever again. Go to the thrift store and buy yourself an old suit jacket that smells like liquor and cheap women, and when you listen to this put it on and you'll be ready to experience the music the way it was lived.
B002QW7ALM|5.0|I had never heard of this movie and was browsing NetFlix at a friend's house to pick out a movie for us.  We didn't see anything that really jumped out, but this looked interesting  So very, very glad we picked it.  I'm not going to go into any details about the movie but its was solid and well done from beginning to end.  I'm kinda picky about movies sometimes.  If they get too unrealistic, go off the rails or are easily predictable then I'm not going to like them very much and certainly won't bother seeing them again.  That said, I intend to watch Pandorum many more times over the coming years which is why I bought myself a copy!  The SciFi aspects were very well done and realistic without over-doing anything.  The horror was also very well done and kept you on the edge of your seat without getting campy, over-the-top gory, etc.  It was an incredibly good balance with excellent writing, acting and directing.  Really wish I had seen this in the theater!  I'd honestly drop $25 tomorrow to see it in IMAX if that were possible.
B001R4MEUM|5.0|The sound is fuller, thicker and meatier than anything Genesis ever put down on vinyl before. Suffice to say they had finally grown beyond their earlier standard of playing, to a new enlighten technical state of perfection and thank God they hadn't run out of ideas lyrically or musically to go along with it. Gabriel's story of Rael, a New York City street kid coming of age was perfect for the bands temperament, their stage show, and most importantly, public consumption. No progressive album should ever be limited to a single album and that is why this remains the ultimate progressive masterpiece spread out over four sides of elegantly encrypted vinyl. Perhaps this is the best progressive statement of all time, there may be doubters but they haven't listen to all four sides at once, if they did they would come away from the experience shaken, breathless, and embarrassed for not being part of the all-knowing ones. The songs are like mini movies that strike a chord between escaping adolescence and floating through the experience with discoveries greater than those of the earliest world travelers. The package itself is up to the expectations of the music with its six cover pictures of Rael in different song set images and as you open the gate fold cover the story of Rael is scrolled across the inside like some biblical constitution of youthful affirmation and enlightenment. The playing is heart stopping, soulful, distant, flawless and above all deliciously perfect at every note. The songs slither at one moment and then grandly parade by in the next. Cuckoo Cocoon, Hairless Heart, Counting Out Time, The Carpet Crawlers, The Chamber of 32 Doors, Lilywhite Lilith and Anyway all show pop rock sensibility that thumb their noses at the standard contrite limitations. The Waiting Room just might be the scariest piece of music ever recorded although the group says the first unrecorded version was infinitely more creepy. Progressively indulgent numbers like, In The Cage, Fly On The Windshield, The Lamia, The Colony Of the Slippermen and Here Comes The Supernatural Anesthetist are all filled with mellotron, guitar and bass runs that show years of hard fraught nights figuring out the difference between really good and really not good enough, this time they got it all right and perhaps better than right, perfect. This is all so serene and yet so grand all at the same time, every listen for me over 30 plus years has produced a new discovery, another cord your amazed by, a lyric that suddenly makes since and a coupling of instrumental passages that seem to line up spiritually for the very first time. When Genesis found this rare apocalypse of time, talent, resources, energy and indulgence they did not stop until they made the best of it. It takes you all the way there, through their vision, out the other side, with little if anything left to listen to of equal value in your future. The birth of this album was the demise of the band, but lucky for you there is always tomorrow and another chance to listen to The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway. So go to sleep and dream of Slippermen, Carpet Crawlers, Hairless Hearts, Lamia's and all things that will never be again, an album so amazingly immaculate as this that time, space and perception become the bright light of inclusion and you my friend are hopelessly wrapped in the cuckoo.
B00177YA1K|4.0|This is another one I don't know why I avoided it for so long. I think I may have mixed it up with the Blues Brothers, if that was the name: the one done by John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd. Anyway, this is a very good movie. Just a little too silly on the science fiction part to qualify for five stars, but great fun.<br /><br />K (Tommy Lee Jones) works for \\"Division 6,\\" he tells some border guards as he manages to select out one of a load of illegal aliens that really is an illegal alien. As in from outer space. But he tells different things to different people, and one of the border guards is certain that there is no Division 6.<br /><br />Due to his amazing performance, K recruits James Edwards of the NYPD (Will Smith), who then becomes J. The only other name you might recognize is Zed, played by Rip Torn. He was quite the heart throb when he was young, but that was a long, long time ago.<br /><br />Since their job is to keep track of all the aliens on the planet, most of whom are refugees and live peacefully disguised, there are lots of opportunities for great sight gags, like when J helps in the birth of a baby alien who really is cute. It's a pretty harrowing experience, but mother, baby and J all come through it OK.<br /><br />Central to the function of the MiB unit is a device like a penlight flashlight that wipes the memories of those involved in encounters. Keep your eye on that \\"light thingie,\\" as it turns out to be pretty important all around.<br /><br />It's a very, very funny movie, but also real adventure.<br /><br />Also keep your eye on the cat.

B000A1GXTQ|4.0|Early but quite good Alfred Hitchcock. Richard Hannay (Robert Donat) is a Canadian on a visit in London. He goes to a music hall where shots are fired, and in the panic that ensues, a lady attaches herself to him and asks him to take her home with him. She calls herself Miss Smith, and is later referred to as Anabella. She is apparently a counter-spy, and wants a map of Scotland so she can go see a professor there who can tell her about the secret information which is about to be smuggled out of the country.<br /><br />She stays in Hannay's apartment overnight, and when she is stabbed in the back, naturally he is wanted for the murder. He knows she was killed as part of this whole spy story she told him, which mentioned the Professor in Scotland and \\"the 39 steps.\\"<br /><br />So Hannay is wanted for murder, and while escaping via a train, he barges into a woman's compartment and starts kissing her, trying to disguise himself because the police are looking for him. Instead of helping him, Pamela (Madeleine Carroll) turns him in to the police. He makes a daring escape on a train bridge over a river.<br /><br />And then it gets REALLY strange! Let's drop a few clues and let you watch the movie to figure it out. One of the characters in the original music hall scene turns out to be very important to the plot, and shows up again at the misic hall scene toward the end of the movie. Pamela is absolutely certain she hates Hannay, so of course they end up handcuffed together. There's a significant clue in the man with the first joint of the little finger of his right hand missing. You won't find out what the 39 steps are until very near the end.<br /><br />I didn't spot a Hitchcock cameo, but there are plenty of crowd scenes where he may be lurking. Have fun
B005LCECU6|4.0|Rush ABC 1974 is the live recording when the band was at The Agora Ballroom in Cleveland, OH.  This has been floating around in bootleg titled \\"The Fifth Order Of Angels\\" or something like that.  I guess someone wanted to make it official but this doesn't seem to have the 'stamp of approval' from the group themselves.  Still, it's a great listen to have for the serious fan.  Sure, you can hear amp buzz and some feedback.  And that annoying panning of Lifeson's guitar.  Not sure what that is all about!  But, this was a live broadcast on WMMS-FM \\"The Buzzard\\" in Cleveland, OH back on August 26, 1974.  For those of us who grew up around Cleveland, this station was the ultimate in the midwest.  It's a good set and you can hear the hunger of the band and the virtuoso playing already.  Back in those days, we didn't have digital recording and digital sequencers and auto-tune and all this stuff we have today.  It was honest from the heart playing.  And this disc proves if you study your instrument and stick to your guns, you can achieve.<br /><br />The 3 'extra' tracks sound like they were recorded from someone's shirt pocket.  They definitely have that \\"bootleg\\" quality.  Still, it shows the band from its beginning and if you're not too nit-picky and can get over the stupid panning, it's a good listen.  Go to a club and listen to an original band.  Yeah, you'll hear some buzz, some feedback, maybe a cheesed note or two.  But, it sure ain't computer music.  And this disc sounds like an upcoming band.  And thinking back, yeah....these guys were and still are, the REAL DEAL.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|This is a beautiful movie in every sense of the word. Sets and costumes are of course wonderful; this is, after all, about royalty. But we get to know quite a lot about the real human beings inside that magnificent court finery. Of course, it is full of intrigue and power struggles: how could a story about a queen be anything else?<br /><br />Victoria (Emily Blunt) was brought up by her widowed mother, the Duchess of Kent (Miranda Richardson) and her husband/lover (??), Sir John Conroy (Mark Strong). Conroy clearly wanted the old king, Victoria's uncle, to die before Victoria came of age so that a regency would be required. Her mother would be the regent, and Conroy would control the Duchess. I guess they both assumed Victoria had no backbone, no mind of her own.<br /><br />Guess again, folks.<br /><br />Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany) basically pushed out Lord Conroy as Victoria's chief adviser, mostly because Conroy was an outright bully who had enraged Victoria while she was still a princess. But Melbourne was not always a good adviser, and there were problems.<br /><br />There was also Price Albert. He was prince of several of those small states that were within what is now Germany. He came to meet Victoria in a blatant play for influence on the part of his uncle, but stayed because he became very fond of Victoria, and she of him. They corresponded for some while when he went back to his home, and eventually she sent for him. She had to ask him to marry her (that was the rule for a queen), and of course he did.<br /><br />Certainly there is a great deal more to the story than that, but it gets quite sketchy not long after Edward was born. It is, after all, titled Young Victoria. And very much worth seeing.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|I mainly use this knife sharpener because I can use it to sharpen the serrated edges. I would never actually use the portion available to sharpen the blade itself. It's nothing personal; but I have no reason to. It only takes a few minutes to use a \\"legit\\" sharpener and get a finer edge quality. But overall, it's a decent purchase; and if I get stuck in a survival situation with a dull knife and this sharpener, I'll be just fine.
B0007Y08QA|1.0|Trevor Reznick (Christian Bale) hasn't slept in a year. But he's a machinist, which is a dangerous job for someone who's mind is going. So what portion of the story is his nightmare, hallucination or whatever, what part is memory, and what really happened the way it is presented to the audience? An interesting question if the truth is eventually figured out. All I can say is that this is the poor man's \\"Number 23.\\" We never do find out exactly what is real and what isn't, even when Trevor finally says to Ivan, who has been haunting him, \\"I know who you are.\\" He doesn't tell the audience!!!<br /><br />The other thing I hated was that Trevor was so skinny he looked like he was just released from Auschwitz. Various people ask if he's OK, but he says he is. Clearly he is not.
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|What can I say \\"Kate is great\\" I need to do a body count, I don't think she killed any two people the same way. I don't see how anyone so good looking could be such a hard core killer- but she pulls it off as if it was real. A major talent and the new kid is amazing also, to be able to say so much with just a glance. Do not miss this movie!
B0017MO10U|2.0|The original Stargate movie was pretty good, but I apparently missed at least one in between, because this one seemed to be assuming I knew things about the characters that I did not know. And to be honest, I couldn't seem to care. For one thing, it involved time paradoxes that provided apparently random kinks in the plot. So much ended up depending on whether character 1 recognized character 2, and vice versa. Again, dependent on at least one movie I missed, or on seriously poor writing.
B0006A9FKA|4.0|This is great fun, I was reluctant to buy it as it may have been a spoof movie but it was a serious movie with crazy people in it. Glad \\"Shaun\\" made it as \\"Scotty\\" on Star Trek he is a versitile actor!
0767803434|4.0|Yeah, I'd vote for Harrison Ford for president. President James Marshall, to be exact. He's not only the president, he's a first class hero, as this story makes clear. Brief sketch, so as not to ruin all the surprises: there are dozens.<br /><br />Air Force One, with the First Lady and First Daughter (age 12) aboard, is highjacked by a group of fanatical communists who want to restore the Soviet Union. Key to their plans is the release of their favorite general from Russian prison. One clue -- just one -- to the whole thing is pretty clear early on in the highjacking: one of the Secret Service agents guarding the president is helping the terrorists.<br /><br />The leader of the terrorist highjackers is Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldman) who is clearly insane, and has no qualms about killing in cold blood. Back in the White House Situation Room sits Vice-President Kathryn Bennett (Glenn Close) trying to cope with it all. Her advisers can't agree, the military folks present various pretty drastic alternatives, and the highjackers have said they will execute one hostage every half hour until their General is released from prison and they have confirmation of the fact.<br /><br />OK, there's your tip of the iceberg. The rest is simply too unpredictable for me to want to spoil anything for you. See this film!

B00441GYZ6|4.0|I love movies based on true stories. I also love documentaries, but that's quite another thing. To me, part of the pleasure of true story movies is how close to my idea of the characters the movie makers have come. I think Flynt is pretty fairly represented here.<br /><br />Flynt (Woody Harrelson) originally owned a little club somewhere in the south (sorry I don't remember where) called the Hustler. I don't think it referred to a pool shark. It wasn't making much money, so he decided to advertise it by producing a \\"newsletter\\" which was primarily photos of the dancers who worked there. It was the printer who suggested that he add some written words to avoid having it labeled porno.<br /><br />Larry also married one of his dancers, Althea (Courtney Love). I don't recall right now when they married, but they had lived together for some time first.<br /><br />To make a long story short, after Flynt bought a paparazzi's photo of Jackie Onassis in the nude, his circulation soared and he had a real money-maker. But he was busted for selling pornography, so once he got out of that mess he decided that he needed to move to somewhere that respected perverts. He moved to Los Angeles, of course.<br /><br />He was indeed busted at least once more for pornography, and then held in contempt of court for refusing to disclose his source for an FBI sting tape. His attorney, Alan Isaacman (Edward Norton), was smart and did his best, but he didn't always win over Flynt being outrageous in court.<br /><br />Flynt and Isaacman were leaving a courthouse when a sniper (who was never identified) shot them both. Isaacman recovered, but Larry was paralyzed from the waist down, and in pretty horrible pain. He was prescribed strong pain killers, and Althea was taught how to administer them. It wasn't long before she was taking them too. Then Flynt had surgery, which ended the pain for him (although he was still paralyzed), and he no longer needed the drugs. But Althea did: she'd become addicted to them. This is consistent with expert opinion and my own experience that you do not get addicted for taking painkillers so long as you have real pain. It is when you take them to get high that addiction is a risk. Larry told Althea that he was going cold turkey after his surgery, and she was, too.<br /><br />It was never explained why that failed for her, and she remained a junkie. So later, when she . . . no, I don't want to get into all that, or you won't even bother watching the movie.<br /><br />Two significant events other than the shooting are depicted in the film, and the consequences for Flynt are depicted. First, Ruth Carter Stapleton (Donna Hanover) invited him to dinner and convinced him to be born again and baptized. Full dunking in a river. But he did not stop publishing Hustler: he did change its tone considerably. He went at least a little crazy trying to be a good Christian and the publisher of Hustler, but after he was shot, he declared that there was no god. Since Althea had hated his conversion in the first place, she was OK with that.<br /><br />As part of his (and Hustler's) return to hedonistic paganism and atheism, Flynt designed a satirical fake liquor ad featuring Jerry Falwell (Richard Paul), and Falwell sued, of course. Flynt counter-sued because Falwell had copied the fake ad and distributed it with a fund-raiser in violation of Flynt's copyright. This is the case that eventually went all the way to the Supreme Court. Do I have to tell you what the verdict was?ed to them. This is consistent with expert opinion and my own experience that you do not get addicted for taking painkillers so long as you have real pain.

B004YM6JLO|5.0|While it's undeniable that The Vampire Diaries is targeted at the teen to 20s crowd, it has appeal for other ages. The gore and violence is kept relevant rather than over the top - and I challenge anyone who doesn't normally buy into the supernatural genre to give this show a chance.<br /><br />While the constant drama surrounding Elena does, at times, get as boring and annoying as the similar infatuation with Lana on Smallville, the show delivers powerful story lines, interesting twists and excellent performances from the majority of the cast. You become drawn into the story and the acting is so good that, for the most part, you completely forget that you're watching a show.<br /><br />Memorable, delicious, with a depth of emotion that drives the main characters to do what's necessary, unthinkable, unavoidable. A great show!
B000P0J0EW|5.0|Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) was wrongly convicted of killing his wife and her lover. The evidence was circumstantial, but to be fair, there was really no other suspect. He was sent to Shawshank Prison for two life terms. The warden is a sadistic bastard with a Bible. The captain of the guards is at least as brutal, but doesn't pretend with the Bible.<br /><br />A couple of cells down from Andy's is Red (Morgan Freeman), the guy who can get things for you. He has a delivery system set up through the laundry delivery. Apparently the laundry done at the prison is for more than just their own use. Andy and Red become friends, watching each other's backs in the brutal world of the prison.<br /><br />One day Andy overhears Captain Hadley (of the prison guards) bitching about how he inherited $35,000 from his brother's estate, but it will probably be cut to nothing by the IRS. Andy, who had been a banker before his wife was killed, risks his wrath to interrupt his conversation and point out that he could set it up in a trust so the IRS would not get a penny.<br /><br />This begins a new \\"career\\" for Andy of doing taxes and estate planning for all the guards, and especially for the warden. In fact, he becomes the warden's personal accountant. As a cover, he is assigned to be assistant to the librarian, Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore). Through endless letter-writing to the state comptroller, he eventually gets a $500 grant to refurbish a room to be a real library. He helps several prisoners learn to read, and to take the GED test for a high school diploma.<br /><br />So what happens when one of the young men he helps to take the GED test mentions that his cell mate in an earlier prison had bragged about killing Andy's wife and her lover? Ah, that's the meat of the story, and for that you must see the film. Believe me, it is worth it.
B005LAJ212|5.0|Hands down THE BEST new show on tv in ages! The plot is juicy, full of intrigue, backstabbing, love lost and found - with Madeline Stowe and Emily Vancamp delivering powerful, believable and memorable acting.<br /><br />What's even better is that there are regular twists that you don't expect - and even retrospectives that suddenly shed a glimpse into a different facet of the plot.<br /><br />Highly recommend this - I've been watching it on TV but will definitely be buying the DVD to watch it again without commercials!!
B0006Z2KYI|4.0|Carole Lombard plays Maria Tura, a well-known actress in Warsaw in 1939. Jack Benny plays her husband, Joseph Tura. The only other actor you are likely to recognize is a very young Robert Stack playing Lt. Stanislaw Sobinski of the Polish Air Force.<br /><br />When the Nazis invaded, the Turas' acting troupe was putting together a satire of Hitler, which was obviously canceled in view of the circumstances. So there they are with all those perfectly good Nazi uniforms, and an opportunity to create a very complicated mayhem.<br /><br />Lt. Sobinski, who had a terrible crush on Maria, was evacuated to England when the Nazis arrived, and was part of a squadron of Polish pilots who worked with the RAF. One day they were visited by a famous professor who was heading back to Warsaw on what he hinted was a secret mission, and the pilots naively gave him their relatives' and friends' addresses to \\"take messages to them.\\" However, Sobinski grows suspicious when the professor does not recognize Maria Tura's name, given that she is so very famous in Warsaw. He goes to English intelligence and . . . but I don't want to spoil all the fun.<br /><br />There are false costumes and beards and mustaches, make-up and all the disguise effects you'd expect from an acting troupe, put to work for the Polish resistance. It's a serious enough story, but told with quite a few laughs. Jack Benny wouldn't know how else to do it.
1612130283|1.0|One of my friends couldn't stop raving about this book and urged me to read it. Because this title was on the Best Seller list, its name was being tossed around in many a talk show and my friend pressing me to read this book (who passed her paperback on to me)...I agreed to give this ''dark and twisted love story'' a try. Well, I actually read through the whole thing, waited for my mind to recover some brain cells, and decided to write my review. So here is what I think:<br /><br />I can see how so many reviewers would find this novel as being pretty much Twilight but with whips. I found the female character (Ana) not only unrealistic but painfully bland and mentally stuck at mid-puberty (whereas Bella is more like post lobotomy). Her male counterpart being the dashing, well off, tormented forbidden fruit. Although comparisons to Twilight and 50 SoG are rampant, I will say that to me, it only took a few chapters into this book to IMMEDIATELY strike me as too similar to a lesser known movie titled  [[ASIN:B0018LX9T4 Secretary]].<br /><br />In that movie, we have Lee...a gawky, shy and sheltered young lady with personal issues (who displays a believable amount of naivete and was very well played by Maggie Gyllenhaal) who obtains a job in a law firm where she begins to form an attraction towards her boss. Her boss whose name is (DING! DING! DING!) Mr. Edward GREY, an intriguing, brooding, yet successful young attorney (yet, older than she) who has had difficulties in maintaining relationships in the past, is demanding, intimidating yet beguiling to her, and eventually reveals his twisted world to her in a way which strangely, makes sense and leads them to an unconventional bond.<br /><br />I won't reveal everything that happens in the movie but, I do see how it may well have also been a base for this novel...just that the writer decided to exaggerate many aspects of it to sate the appetites of a certain target audience that either isn't exposed to such fodder and would devour every graphic detail or can relate to the characters to some level (-shudders at the thought-). I, personally, am not impressed. Although there were a few moments that showed potential, the dialogue between the two was often too clich&eacute; to be absorbed enjoyably and the intimate scenarios kept seeming like an ever desperate attempt to grip the reader.<br /><br />Yes, I will admit, I also ''couldn't put the book down'' simply due to the fact that I wanted to see what made this a best seller. I have to say that after reading this, I had to medicate my brain with some real erotica (Anais Nin) then took a small dose of really controversial dark and twisted (Marquis deSade) just so I can refresh my mind that Writing is actually considered an Art and this book is just a paper version of what seems like the creatively bankrupt modern entertainment industry(i.e. like movies that invest heavily in visuals but have mediocre story lines and acting).<br /><br />Verdict: Book was way too over hyped.devour every graphic detail or can relate to the characters to some level (-shudders at the thought-).

6305972591|2.0|Well, I don't normally want to see Stephen King stories, because they've been getting gorier as they go along. But I had read this one (originally a short story), and I had seen clips, and I figured being so old, it wouldn't be as disgusting as the later films. Yeah, OK, sort of.<br /><br />In a small town in Nebraska, one day three years ago (says the film), all those under 19 rose up and slaughtered all the adults. They are led by a religious fanatic who had been a child preacher before he came to the town, and knew how to manipulate the children to do his bidding. Just goes to show you people should not use kids for preachers. But anyway.<br /><br />Cut to a handsome young couple (Peter Horton and Linda Hamilton) who are passing through on their way to a vacation in Seattle. They were driving down a back road near the cursed town when a boy ran out in front of their car. They couldn't avoid hitting him, but it turns out his throat had been cut back in the corn field, where the couple found his suitcase covered in blood. They put the body in the trunk of the car and take the suitcase with them and drive off to find someone to report the murder to.<br /><br />An old guy working on a truck at a gas station that has no gas directs them to a town 19 miles away, and warns them against the nearby town, which is full of religious fanatics who don't like strangers. He's wrong about that. They want the strangers: they need them to sacrifice to He Who Walks Behind (between?) the Rows.<br /><br />I think I'd have liked this better if it turned out to just be psychosis and manipulation on the part of Isaac, the young preacher, and Malachi, his bloodthirsty henchmen. But there's a supernatural element involved in the nature of He Who Walks Behind the Rows. Exactly who or what he is never becomes clear.<br /><br />Still, I guess it's worth watching. If you generally like horror movies, and specifically like Stephen King, it's probably just the sort of thing you like.

B0030Y11XS|4.0|Michael Moore does it again. He researched this one quite well, talking to people whose farms and homes have been foreclosed, walking with his father over the empty ground where his father's 33-year job in a factory had taken place. He tried to get a real answer to the question \\"What is a derivative?\\" from both traders and academic economists. He documented the door and window factory that was closed by Bank of America, occupied by its workers because they hadn't gotten the pay they were owed, and then opened again as a co-op by those same workers. He toured the bakery in California which is a very successful co-op, and in fact I remember their bread fondly. He also went to the big Wall Street banks and asked for our money back, wrapping the entire block in a \\"crime scene\\" yellow tape.<br /><br />Sure, some of the things he does are stunts, done for the publicity rather than for any serious impact. But that publicity IS serious impact. And interestingly, a majority of the 700 billion bailout has indeed been payed back by now.<br /><br />One important point that may not have been made as clearly as it needed to be was the war over words that is tied up in the financial crisis. For too long, we developed a duck-and-cover mentality at the very mention of the word Socialism, let alone Communism. It's time we developed a healthy skepticism about Capitalism, too. The fact is, any of these \\"economic theories\\" which are touted as THE solution or THE problem are dangerous in their distilled form.<br /><br />What we need, really, is pragmatism. Perhaps if we started capitalizing it and writing scholarly journal articles about it, that would help. But we need to look at each proposed change for its intended and unintended consequences, what alternatives might work better, how compromise might be reached. If we can't really fix the health care system without a single payer plan like Medicare for all, as I believe to be the case, then let's not be put off by the label \\"socialized medicine.\\"d medicine.\\"

6305212112|5.0|Well, I've heard about this one since it was new, so I'm not sure why it took me so long to get around to it. I'm glad I did.<br /><br />Idgie Threadgoode (Mary Stuart Masterson, Joon of Benny &) lost her older brother to a train accident when she was a little girl. She had been his favorite, and she adored him. It came very hard for her. She grew up rather wild and self-willed, which was not appropriate for a girl in the south in the 1920s.<br /><br />Her story is told to Evelyn Couch (Kathy Bates) by Ninny Threadgoode (Jessica Tandy), who is now a very old lady in the same retirement center as Evelyn's husband's aunt (or great-aunt?). Evelyn keeps being thrown out of her husband's aunt's room every time he goes visiting, and so she struck up a conversation with Ninny Threadgoode, who told her all about Idgie.<br /><br />She could drink and swear and gamble and fight as well as the guys, and wore men's clothes much of the time. One summer, her mother invited her cousin Ruth (Mary-Louisa Parker) to spend the summer with them, hoping the very proper Ruth would be a good influence on Idgie. Predictably, she was a \\"bad\\" influence on Ruth instead.<br /><br />But Ruth got married. When Idgie went to visit her in her new home, she also had a black eye and bruised cheek. Idgie is irate, of course, and threatens Ruth's SOB of a husband that she will kill him if he hurts Ruth again. Eventually, when she finds out Ruth is pregnant and scared to death of her husband, Idgie takes a couple of strong arms with her and moves Ruth back to her place.<br /><br />The title of the movie refers to the Whistle Stop Cafe that Idgie and Ruth opened to support themselves after Ruth's baby is born and named after Idgie's lost big brother. There's some considerable hassle over the fact that her friend Sipsey (Cecily Tyson) and her son Big George run a barbecue in the back of the cafe. Segregation was still big, and in fact the KKK got involved.<br /><br />Bare outline here: Ruth's ex-husbandwas missing for some five years, and then his truck was dredged out of the river. Because someone remembered hearing Idgie threaten him, she and Big George stand trial for murder, even though the body was never found. If you want to know how it turns out, you'll have to get the movie and see for yourself.
B000JIHP88|5.0|Very soothing and nice looking mobile. Leaves are adorable. Animals are cute.<br />Our daughter likes it a lot already. She keeps staring at it. Music is fine too, but I personally like the nature sounds more.<br />And it was really easy to put together.

B000C65Z1G|4.0|Well, it has very little to do with gardening, which I wish I'd known earlier. I must admit this one caught me napping. It was not like anything I'd ever seen before, except to some small degree documentaries. It is fiction, but it follows so closely on fact as to be positively chilling.<br /><br />Justin Quale (Ralph Fiennes) was a fairly minor British diplomat on his way to Nairobi when he was seduced by Tessa (Rachel Weisz), who asked him to take her along with him to Africa in whatever capacity he thought appropriate. So he took her as his wife.<br /><br />Turns out Tessa is a progressive activist, working with a variety of groups, including Amnesty International, and one which was specifically investigating the exploitation of Africans in drug testing. Through her work in an AIDS abatement program, she came into contact with doctors who knew that people were being used as guinea pigs for drug testing, supposedly with informed consent, but in fact with their consent being the only way they could go to the only available clinic.<br /><br />Then she and one of the African doctors are murdered, and Justin decides he must find out who and why. She had told him very little about her work, and so he was working with what he found among her papers (those that were not stolen when her computer and discs were) and the people she had apparently trusted.<br /><br />I say \\"apparently\\" because it turns out almost nobody is telling the truth, nothing is as it seems to be, and some supposedly very respectable people were involved in some really horrible activities.<br /><br />It's pretty hard to follow, but sooner or later the important points get sorted out. And as I say, it sounded so horribly real. I wonder how much of it really is.

B001BPJJ9G|4.0|Talk about irony! Just after I finished watching this movie and before I got a chance to write my review, I fell off the back step of my building. The people in this movie fell a lot harder and suffered a lot more severe damage than I did. Roy Walker, a stunt man in silent films, was supposed to jump from a railroad bridge into a river and emerge on a horse. Didn't work. Apparently he broke something kind of crucial, because he could not feel it when his little friend Alexandria touched his toes. Alexandria, a five-year-old migrant worker, fell out of an orange tree and broke her arm and probably her shoulder as well, given that her cast was set way up on her shoulder and a bar held her arm up. They were in the same hospital, and since they are both bored and lonely, they become friends.<br /><br />\\"Tell me a story,\\" demands Alexandria, and Roy complies. He weaves a story that makes little sense if you want it to follow along a coherent line, but of course it's more like a dream, in that when Alexandria objects to a turn in the plot, he changes it. He's drawing on a lot of experience and imagination, but he jumbles it up most charmingly. Of course, as he tells the story, we see it.<br /><br />And every so often he interrupts the story to ask Alexandria to do something for him. First he asks her to steal some morphine for him, but that doesn't work out quite as expected. In fact, there were three attempts, but the last one ended rather tragically.<br /><br />No, I'm not going to tell you any more. It's a charming movie, the characters of Roy and Alexandria are charming, the heroes and villains of the story are drawn bold and bright, with lots of inside-joke type humor and lots of adventure. The villain's henchmen wear all-black armor that looks remarkably like the suited-up X-ray technician Alexandria saw in the hallway, and they sound more and more like animals all the time.<br /><br />One of the characters in the story is Charles Darwin, if that gives you any idea of what we have going here.of what we have going here.

B00003CWNR|5.0|This is a very thoughtful movie, with many layers of meaning. I think I'll have to see it a couple more times to get them all.<br /><br />Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire) was born in a Maine orphanage of an unwed mother. His first adoptive parents soon returned him because \\"he didn't make a sound.\\" Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine), director of the orphanage, concluded that he was returned because he was \\"too happy.\\" The second set of adoptive parents got him to cry: they beat him. After Dr. Larch rescued him from them, he decided to keep him at the orphanage and raise Homer as his own. You get an early appreciation of Dr. Larch's attitude from a couple of things; he reads a chapter of a book to the children every night at bedtime, and he turns off the light saying, \\"Good night, you princes of Maine, you kings of New England.\\"<br /><br />Homer thus grew up being Dr. Larch's assistant, which was useful in part because Dr. Larch was in the habit of putting himself to sleep by pouring ether on a filter mask. Also, Dr. Larch performed abortions when needed, which Homer would not help, as well as deliveries. Homer learned to deliver babies very well, and helped take care of the smaller children, and generally was very smart and capable. Indeed, Dr. Larch figured he was already a competent ob/gyn, even though he had little schooling. I suppose he would have been called a midwife but for the gender issue.<br /><br />One day an attractive young couple came to the orphanage so that the girl, Candy Kendall (Charlize Theron) could have an abortion. Her lover, Lt. Wally Worthington (Paul Rudd) was about to return to active duty on the \\"Burma Run.\\" He was a pilot and this was WWII.<br /><br />When they left, Homer asked them to give him a ride, not even caring where they were going. Turns out they were going to the coast, where Wally's mother, a widow, ran an apple orchard and cider house, and Candy's father was a lobster man. Homer had never seen the ocean, never seen a lobster, never done much of anything. But Wally's mother needed apple pickers, so she gave him a job. He was the only white picker, and they all lived in a bunkhouse in the cider house during harvest time.<br /><br />The cider house rules were posted on a piece of paper in the bunk house, but none of the other pickers could read. When Homer started reading them out, Mr. Rose, the foreman, said they didn't need them. In fact, he doesn't finish reading them out until near the end of the film.<br /><br />How Homer gets on with the apple picking and everything else, and finally returns to the orphanage as a grown man, is the basis of the story. If I haven't given too much away by saying that he eventually returns, perhaps I would if I told you the circumstances. You have to see it.<br /><br />Even if the only reason was to see the adorable children who play the orphans, and have the novel experience of a story about orphans who are not exploited or mistreated, it would be worthwhile. But there's so very much more.
B0080BFWE0|5.0|Ok, I can't really review the new Blu-ray edition of 'R&M's High School Reunion'.....it hasn't even been released yet, DUH.......but I have to imagine the HD transfer will be excellent, and I HOPE it will have a fistfull of special features included, we'll see.  Really, I'm just here to testify that R&M, from the first time I saw it in 1997 and in each of the probably dozen viewings since, remains one of the funniest 'guilty pleasure' films of all time!  AND it has a heart of pure gold at the center of all the hysterical post-high school hijinks.  The vintage 1980's New Wave soundtrack alone is worth the cost of admission!<br /><br />Lisa Kudrow and Mira Sorvino dive into their characters with a fearless gusto, creating iconic (if slightly moronic) 1990's versions of clubgirls who are BFF's since high school, and continue to be the essential supports for each other's sometimes fragile and yet utterly unwarranted and overblown self esteem. It's kind of ironic, and more than a little pleasureable watching two of Hollywood's brightest and most generous actresses portraying such completely self-absorbed, delusional characters!<br /><br />The rest of the cast is equally brilliant and deliciously funny.  Janeane Garofalo is wicked as R&M's fellow high school alum, a nicotine-addicted, angst-ridden, goth-girl who just can't get past her loner status in HS, even though she's gone on to create success for herself following her heart....or rather her cravings. Cameron Mannheim seems impossibly naive, young and vulnerable playing the classmate who was involved in everything, and annoyed the hell out of the rest of the class. Alan Cumming is literally unrecognizable as his character morphs from nerdy HS geek to Billionaire mogul.  And on and on, the cast of largely at the time upandcoming actors seem to really enjoy playing their parts as if they were hitting for the outfield fence....which could go wrong in another film, with another script or another director, but here it just adds layer upon layer of comedic icing to this cinematic confection!<br /><br />I won't go into all the plot turns and contrivances, but suffice to say R&M is chock full of funny (and occasionally sweet) scenes providing a look into the minds of these young women who refuse to see their rather mundane lives as anything less than full blown exciting, and their exuberance is contagious!  Can we just talk a minute about the dance club scene early on in the film, where R&M, disappointed at that night's prospects in the club, decide to dance together, and casually step out onto the dancefloor, launching in a perfectly synchronized and choreographed disco pas de deux???<br /><br />YES, I love Romy and Michele---I always have and I always will.  They NEVER fail to brighten my spirits.  Rock on, Girls, and welcome to HD at last, you deserve it!t adds layer upon layer of comedic icing to this cinematic confection!<br /><br />I won't go into all the plot turns and contrivances, but suffice to say R&M is chock full of funny (and occasionally sweet) scenes providing a look into the minds of these young women who refuse to see their rather mundane lives as anything less than full blown exciting, and their exuberance is contagious!

B002VPE1AW|5.0|OK, this is it. I only have it in 2D on a DVD, but it has quite enough impact anyway. I think 3D might be seriously overwhelming. Visually, this is an amazingly beautiful movie.<br /><br />The point is made visually and every other kind of way that the powerful and destructive machines of the human invasion have no place on Pandora. Pandora is a planet that quite obviously represents the best of fertile nature. Certainly there are predators, very frightening ones indeed, but the Na'vi have adapted to sharing the world with them. The Na'vi are as intimately in tune to the life of the entire planet as we understand Native Americans to be, but with a world far more abundant and fertile than the rather arid reservations on which the natives eke out an existence in the US today.<br /><br />Into this garden of Eden comes a group of Avatars, which are cloned by a combination of Na'vi and human DNA in such a way that a human can be linked to his Na'vi Avatar so that when one is awake, the other is asleep, and they share their knowledge and memories and, to the extent possible, their personalities. Jake Sully's twin brother had been training for Avatar work, and his Avatar clone was almost ready to decant, when he was killed. It was so very lucky that he had a twin, and so Jake was summoned to work his dead brother's Avatar. But Jake was crippled by an accident, and has to go to Pandora with his wheelchair.<br /><br />The mining operation on Pandora looks like a military operation, and in fact hired a lot of former Marines, but it is a commercial venture. So we have the mercenaries who run fantastic robotic monsters and huge mining equipment to recover Unobtanium, a very rare and valuable element which lies in very rich deposits right under the enormous Sacred Tree of the Na'vi. As we get to know the Na'vi beliefs and rituals, it becomes obvious this is no coincidence.<br /><br />Yes, there is also a charming blue-skinned love story between Jake and the local Na'vi princess. There are flying dragons to ride, pagan rituals, unimaginable beauty in the landscape, including a level of bio-luminescence that turns the place into Wonderland at night. There's great beauty, terrible evil, love and hate, huge battles, adventures, heroes and villains. I'd recommend this film to anyone.There are flying dragons to ride, pagan rituals, unimaginable beauty in the landscape, including a level of bio-luminescence that turns the place into Wonderland at night.

B00007L4MJ|4.0|Very Art Deco, very strange, but historically vital and also pretty interesting.<br /><br />Metropolis takes place in 2026, but you have to remember that it is as imagined by 1927. I believe it was Robert Heinlein (or maybe Isaac Asimov?) who said every science fiction story has three times: the year it was written, the year in which it is set, and the year in which the reader/viewer experiences it. Especially when we are far closer to the year imagined than the year in which the imagining was done, the more slack we have to cut the writer/director.<br /><br />Metropolis is divided into three areas. On the top, both physically and metaphorically, are the pleasure gardens and stately homes of the privileged class. The idle rich, for the most part, but also people like the Master of Metropolis and his immediate staff. In the middle, only a little underground, are the machines. This is where the workers work, but where they live is much further underground.<br /><br />One day, the son of John Fredersen, the Master of Metropolis, was in a pleasure garden chasing a teasing girl when a lovely young woman appeared at the door surrounded by workers' children, dressed in rags and looking pitiful. She admonishes young Fredersen to see his brothers, meaning the children.<br /><br />He follows them, and finds himself in the machine rooms, a part of Metropolis he had never seen. He is horrified to see how the workers sweat and slave, even though most of what they are doing is turning dials and pushing buttons and watching gauges. One worker falls behind, and the temperature gauge for which he is responsible starts to go up past the warning points. Since a hallucination scene is involved here, I can't be sure how much of it is really happening. But Fredersen perceives the workers as sweating bodies being fed into the maw of Moloch.<br /><br />There are a great many allegorical references to both Christian and pagan images, and one which sounded a lot like the Jewish \\"let my people go\\" line, and their waiting for a messiah (Mediator, in their terms). It turns out the beautiful young lady who had befriended the children is named Maria, and meets with the workers in what seems to be a religious area of some kind, with crosses and candles related to an altar, but all in a rather surreal Deco style.<br /><br />For the benefit of all of you who have seen the silver robot figure (it's on the cover of the DVD case), you will find Rotwang, the inventor, to seem a great deal like Dr. Frankenstein, but with a much more complicated laboratory.<br /><br />I'm not going to spoil the fun for you. Enjoy finding all the symbols and allegories, including the pentagram on a door, the whore of Babylon riding a many-headed beast, and lots of others. I will leave you with the quote which forms the basic theme, and which is displayed at the beginning of the film:<br /><br />\\"The mediator between brain and muscle must be the heart.\\" This is said in several variations by several characters, but is probably a quote from Fritz Lang himself.e go\\" line, and their waiting for a messiah (Mediator, in their terms).

B00005RDRO|3.0|The satire to end all satires. It takes a real murder mystery fan to appreciate all the nuances, but it's pretty funny. It's also very, very silly.<br /><br />Lionel Twain (Truman Capote) invites a group of famous fictional detectives to his spooky old mansion for \\"dinner and a murder.\\" So we have Sam Diamond (Peter Falk), Jessica Marbles (Elsa Lanchester), Milo Perrier (James Coco), Dick and Dora Charleston (David Niven and Maggie Smith), and Sidney Wang (Peter Sellers), as satires of Sam Spade, Miss Jane Marple, Hercule Poirot, Nick and Nora Charles, and Charlie Chan. Then there is Alec Guinness as the blind butler and Nancy Walker as the deaf and dumb maid. The jokes get pretty tacky with this lot, as you can imagine. And don't expect the plot to make any sense.<br /><br />Nevertheless, it is a \\"can't help laughing\\" kind of movie.

0783226063|2.0|I remember when this came out, most of the people who liked it said it was not as good as the books (I wasn't a big fan of the books). They mostly said that Sting played Feyd Rautha. Big deal: I was no big Sting fan. And in fact, most of what he does is strut around and look like a rock star.<br /><br />There's so much one needs to know about the world we're in here that it's necessary to get the beautiful Imperial Princess to narrate the basics at the beginning. Sorry; you'll barely get a glimpse of her later in the film.<br /><br />Anyway, the planet Arrakis aka Dune is a (guess what) desert planet that has importance for exactly one reason: spice. It is a narcotic that allows those who use it to fold space/time, traveling without moving. Not just in their minds but in body as well. That this is never explained is typical of the rest of the film.<br /><br />The planet Caladan is the home of the Clan Atreides, Giedi Prime is the home of the Clan Harkonnen, and Kaitain is the home of the Emperor of the Universe. The Harkonnen have been controlling the spice mining and spice trade, but now the emperor decides to replace them with the Atreides. It's pretty clear he means to create a fight between the two houses, weaken both to the point where they cannot challenge him. There's a creature who has to visit him in a tank of water or some other fluid who encourages him in this scheme.<br /><br />That will have to do, except to point out that Kyle MacLochlan plays Paul Atreides and is serious eye candy. Far more than Sting.

B001OQCV2E|4.0|This is the ultimate disaster movie. Does anyone at all survive, and if so, who? How? Let's just say yes; technology. I'll leave the rest to boggle your mind.<br /><br />It's all about the special effects, I suppose, although there is a complex plot (all puns intended) and some interesting characters. Danny Glover plays the President, but I didn't see any other actors or actresses I knew. One looked hauntingly familiar, a rich man named Carl Anhauser who was some sort of government official, who turns out to be played by Oliver Platt. Hippie-dippie pirate radio announcer and conspiracy buff Charlie Frost was played by Woody Harrelson.<br /><br />Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) took his children to Yosemite National Park to do some hiking and came across a secret government installation. They are spotted by Charlie Frost in the restricted area, and as soon as they emerge and their Army escort has left, Frost stops them to ask what the government people said. Turns out he was the voice on the radio they had heard on the drive up there, and he tells Jackson what he knows about the secret program around the fact that the world is scheduled to blow up, and Yosemite is about to become an active volcano.<br /><br />This is, however, not the beginning of the movie. First we see a bunch of officials and scientists from 2008 onward, reacting to the scientist who has conclusively shown that the unprecedented solar activity has emitted a new sort of neutrino that is heating up the earth's core.<br /><br />It's all earthquakes and buildings falling down and bridges collapsing and tidal waves, and even some humor here and there. It's non-stop action, and the audience can't help wondering if anyone at all will survive, and if so, how? Through a series of hair-raising close calls and miraculous escapes, incredible courage, and some very sophisticated technology, all done at a break-neck pace. I was exhausted by the time it was over.

That one star up there is for her.<br /><br />It's violent, it's depressing, and in the end, it's pretty incomprehensible. I'm still trying to figure the point of the story.

B002T9H2MO|4.0|Spooky. I thought I had figured out what was happening, and so there was no big surprises due, but I was wrong. I had figured out what was discovered somewhere around the middle of the film, but not how it would play out to the end. Not even close. I was probably some confused by tastes of 2001: A Space Odyssey in a couple of plot elements.<br /><br />Anyway, Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) is alone in the mining operation on the dark side of the moon, if you don't count Gerty (voiced by Kevin Spacey) the computer. Resist the urge to consider him another HAL9000. Gerty has a screen that displays an emoticon to express himself with, including actually having a tear in his eye at one point. Mostly it's just happy face or frowny face, but he has a pretty decent repertoire, actually.<br /><br />The premise is that Sam is near the end of his three-year contract, and eager to get home to his beautiful wife Tess and their adorable daughter Eve. He gets messages from them which cannot be two-way because something is wrong with the communications equipment. He's missing them terribly, looking forward to getting home, when he goes out in the rover to do some routine chore at one of the completely automated mining machines and has a smash-up. Next thing you know, he's waking up in the infirmary and Gerty is explaining that he had an accident, and will need to rest for awhile.<br /><br />And then things get seriously complicated.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|What a pathetic attempt by an inexperinced author's lack of skill in writing erotica. The author's confession that she was inspired by Stephanie Meyer's Twilight series is truly apparent in Fifty Shades of Grey. Her characters lack development, credibility, and depth. A \\"billionaire\\" entrepreneur like Christian Grey? Please...the only realistic person who might come close to that level of financial success and wealth is Mark Zuckerberg, not exactly a Christian Grey type. The author's limited research provides little if any framework for the setting. Did she even bother to visit Portland or Seattle to learn how to write about either city? Probably not. The novel's innocent and virgin-turned-submissive Anastasia Steele is neither believable or genuine. What 21-year-old speaks like this? The excessive use of \\"crap\\" and \\"holy-whatever\\" infect the narrative like a rampant virus without a cure. The heavily editorialzed \\"inner subconscious\\" voice reeks of juvenile self talk. Is the character nearly twenty-two or in the midst of an adolescent crisis of self identity? The tone of the novel is perhaps the worst part of the entire story. A reader cannot help but feel exposed to reading a tween girl's diary of her \\"first time\\" with BDSM. This novel is so poorly written, filled with cliches, flat characters, limited dialogue, and contrived sex scenes--think heaving breasts, shuddering orgasms, flushing, swooning, blushing...etc. That is why this novel is garnering so much interest and selling so well--readers are obviously ignorant and oblivious about the earlier and better works of adult erotica that set the standard long before this hack entered the arena. Most of E.L. James' readers have probably never read anything by Anne Rice (the Beauty series written under the pseudonym A.N. Roquelaire), Arthur Miller's Tropic of Cancer, Anais Nin, Elizabeth McNeill's Nine and Half Weeks, or the classic story of BDSM, The Story of O by Pauline Reage. These authors represent the skill, talent, style, and experience it takes to pen an exceptional work of fiction (or is it all fiction?). E.L. James in her stereotypcal British repressed voice provides only one redeeming shred of hope with this novel--that housewives in middle America are getting laid, and their inspiration--? A poorly constructed, impossibly simple, trite and pedestrian story that in the end, feels like a grown up Bella sharing her BDSM story with little girls who think they've grown up...OH CRAP...what a fitting way to describe this book! Don't waste your money...try Kink.com to see online and discover a real experience with BDSM!<br /><br /> While E.L. can \\"stir the loins\\" of her readers, (and from her recent appearances and media junkets on The Today Show, and others) they are most likely married haus-fraus who are desperate for some sex and must voyeuristically follow Ana through her initiation<br /><br />How mamy times do these characters \\"mumur\\" to each other? Even the thesaurus feature on any word processing program could have solved this major problem of diction and word choice!<br /><br /> of this novel demonstrates E.L.
B0007PALZ2|5.0|Wow! Why didn't anyone tell me about this one before?<br /><br />Bruce Willis is Jim Cole, who is a criminal in 2035, when he is offered an opportunity to win a full pardon for going back in time to try to obtain a pure sample of the virus that ended up killing something like 90% of the world's population in 1996 to 1997. One problem is that the time machine doesn't work with any great precision, so he goes first to 1990, then back, then to 1917, then back, and finally to 1996.<br /><br />A couple of people he saw in 1990 are also involved with him in 1996. One is Jeffrey (Brad Pitt), a truly manic paranoid sociopath who was in the locked ward of a mental hospital with Jim. Jim was put there when he tried to explain that he was from the future and there was a virus that was going to kill most of the human race. Well, naturally.<br /><br />His psychiatrist was Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe), who believed he was totally insane in 1990, but when she saw him again in 1996, he kidnapped her and then gradually persuaded her to help him. I won't say any more about it except that Jeffrey the mad maniac, shows up in 1996, too. Still crazy after all those years. Possibly even crazier.<br /><br />So who are the 12 Monkeys? Well, that's an underground group that seems to be a radical outgrowth of PETA. More than that I cannot say.

B00009ATIX|4.0|Interesting, but I still don't understand it very well.<br /><br />Dr. Chris Kelvin (George Clooney) gets an urgent message from his friend in the space station Prometheus that something weird is going on, and begging him to come at once and sort it out. Since Dr. Kelvin is a neuropsychologist, clearly we are talking something mental. The reason his friend gives for not saying more is, \\"People are listening.\\"<br /><br />So Dr. Kelvin goes, and soon finds out what is happening, if not how or why. Each member of the crew has a \\"visitor,\\" someone who can't possibly be there, but is. Chris' visitor is his beautiful wife, dead by suicide several years earlier. Then Snow (technician) says his brother was his visitor, the little kid was the son of the guy who originally begged Chris to come help, and Gordon, the fourth member of the team, refuses to say who her visitor is.<br /><br />It's really a pretty psychedelic story, and I have two questions that seriously bug me here: (1) Who was Gordon's visitor, and why wouldn't she tell Dr. Kelvin? (2) Since it becomes clear that the Solarians are somehow doing this, what were their motives? Are they friends or foes of the humans?

B0001NBMEE|2.0|This is right out of the Sunday Comics. The dialogue is so artificial you can almost see the word balloons. If they'd gone just a little further, it would qualify as camp.<br /><br />Seriously: the plot is so obvious, you know who the mysterious Black Knight is long before anyone in the movie does. The mix-up between which sister loves which knight is projected like a grade school punch line. When Sir Gawain (Sterling Hayden) is in bed with a serious injury and it is announced that the winner of the tournament will win the hand of Princess Aleta (Janet Leigh), it doesn't take rocket science to figure out that it is Prince Valiant (Robert Wagner) in Gawain's armor that challenges Sir Brack (James Mason).<br /><br />One other element that may be OK for some, but grated on my nerves, is the religious assumptions underlying it all. The villains are Viking pagans, and the heroes are English Christians. The Viking Christians, on the other hand are also heroes. The bigotry is pretty obvious, but in 1954 it was simply taken for granted.<br /><br />Good movie for children, but children these days have probably never read Prince Valiant cartoons in the Sunday Comics. I was still a child myself in 1954, so I suppose we have to assume this was made for the Baby Boom generation. I never saw it then, though; stories with swords and fighting in them to this extent would have been for boys.

B000ECX0QU|4.0|Alfred Hitchcock brings to the screen a spy story of satisfying complexity and sophistication written by Leon Uris. It takes place during one of the cold war's hot spots: the Cuban missile crisis.<br /><br />Michael Nordstrom (John Forsythe) is a top US spy who is forced to enlist the aid of Andre Devereaux (Frederick Stafford) with regard to some critical information about what the Soviets are doing in Cuba. But both men are aware that the \\"neutral\\" French embassy in Washington seems to have rather too close communication with Moscow. Still, Andre has an \\"asset\\" in Havana in the form of a beautiful lady who is in love with him, and so he goes to Cuba to see what he can see.<br /><br />There's a lot of clever twists, a good bit of behind the scenes information concerning how spies do their work, and none of it so fast-paced that one cannot follow it. We spend time in Paris, New York, Havana, and Washington, not to mention on several airplanes.<br /><br />I'm not going to give too much away, but the critical clues have to do with who knows whom, and who does not know that X knows Y, all of that. There are several intertwined love stories, but they don't overwhelm the picture. Since there is known to be a leak in the French embassy, you can't help looking at several characters and wonder which one is passing information on to the Soviets.<br /><br />I did not spot Alfred Hitchcock's cameo appearance.
B000784WMW|5.0|There isn't much more to say that hasn't already been reported:  this is best rendition of Jane Eyre that will probably ever be.  It's like Charlotte Bronte inhabited the body of Zelah Clarke and the minds of everyone else involved.  How else could it have been so true not only to the book, but to the author herself, as history has depicted her?  It's eerie to say the least.  HIGHLY recommend this to any high school student having a hard time appreciating this &#34;required reading&#34;.  Not only is it accurate to a tee, it should help make the overall experience more enjoyable.  Don't bother trying to save time by watching instead of reading though...this is a VERY long mini-series:  if you read fairly quickly, it might take longer to watch the movie!  It should be said that to this day, when Timmothy Dalton is asked what he considers his best work, he says Jane Eyre.  Zelah Clarke essentially never worked again after this, and many believe she &#34;peaked&#34; too early, having achieved near perfection as Jane.  The production values are, sadly, very poor.  Shame on the BBC for not funding this better when it was made, or going back and trying to enhance it with better technology.  The costumes and sets are perfect, but the lighting and sound dismal to say the least.  Even worse are the graphics and &#34;soundtrack&#34; (if you could call it one):  something that could easily be changed after the fact but never was.

0784011680|4.0|Charlie Chaplin is played by Robert Downey, Jr., but also by Chaplin himself in old films, both his own movies and various studio publicity and news items. Another odd little twist is that Geraldine Chaplin plays her own grandmother, Charlie's mother. The only truly fictional character is played by Anthony Hopkins, an editor on the writing of Chaplin's biography, or perhaps his literary agent, or something. In any case, it gives him the excuse to ask the elderly Chaplin questions about his early years and provide narration for the story.<br /><br />Dan Aykroyd is just right playing Mack Sennett, the director/producer who gave Chaplin his start in films. Kevin Kline plays Douglas Fairbanks and Maria Pitillo plays Mary Pickford, two of Chaplin's closest friends. For the villain of the piece, Kevin Dunn plays J. Edgar Hoover.<br /><br />Chaplain was married four or five times -- I rather lost track -- and at one point was sued for child support for a child that was not his because the State of California would not admit blood test evidence in court. Not DNA, mind you, but just blood type. Chaplin and the baby were tested, but the judge suppressed the evidence that would have exonerated him from responsibility. He paid child support until the girl turned 18.<br /><br />The last marriage, to Oona O'Neill (Moira Kelly), was the only one that lasted, and that for more than 20 years. In fact, I think it was more than 30 years, because the setting of when he wrote his autobiography was at least ten years before he died. Oona was only 18, Chaplin was already middle aged, when they married. It seems she may have been the only wife who actually loved him, rather than his money and his fame.<br /><br />A lot of the political material in the film was things I had not known, including the fact that he was criticized for making \\"The Great Dictator\\" before the US got into the war, and only praised for it once we were in it. Another is that Hoover eventually had him barred from returning to the states after he'd spent some time in London, arguing that he was a communist. It became quite clear that Chaplin was by no means a communist, with lower case or capital letter, but rather a humanist. Hoover, never one of the great intellectual lights of the nation, was unable to tell the difference, and cited the fact that Chaplin had never renounced his British citizenship and applied for American citizenship.<br /><br />An interesting biography of an interesting person.ning to the states after he'd spent some time in London, arguing that he was a communist.

0345803485|1.0|I love to read. Love romance, love erotica. This....was SO BORING. I felt like I was reading an unedited book written by an eighteen year old. Redundant wording, and at times felt like the author just opened a thesaurus to throw out a word that didn't even flow,  and of course \\"oh my\\" over and over. It was such a slow, slow read. I love being pulled into a book and with all the hype I was excited to read this. Then someone said it was like twilight for adults. Well, sorry folks. Twilight was a far more interesting read than this. Did I loathe the main female character in both? Yes, but how 50 Shades ever got on a best seller list...I am so lost. I found myself not caring at all about the characters, there really is no plot and I found myself rolling my eyes so often I was struggling to find reasons to continue to read.

B007C4ZJ0S|1.0|I had seen the trailer for this movie and thought it looked rather compelling, so I was eager to rent it when it became available in the local Red Box rental machine.  Before I had actually watched it, my daughter saw the DVD and mentioned that she had seen the movie in the theater and that it was disappointing.  I told her about the trailer, and she said it contained the best two minutes of the entire movie.  It turns out her assessment was entirely accurate.<br /><br />I had a sneaking suspicion that the movie was going to be a total dud after viewing it for only about five minutes.  The longer I watched it, the more my suspicion was confirmed.  This movie is the kind you keep watching because you hope it's going to pick up its pace, but that never happened. I finally just shut the movie off after about 50 minutes.  Even though there were only about 40 minutes remaining, and even though I could have invested the remaining time to at least see how things ended, I just didn't care anymore. It was really that bad.<br /><br />To give you an idea of the movie's content, the movie opens with a scene in a diner where Mallory Kane (Gina Carano) and Aaron (Channing Tatum) end up fighting. Aaron is totally pummeling the hell out of Mallory, but in a manner taken straight out of the old Channel 47 wrestling matches of the 1970s, even though Mallory should have been knocked out (or killed) several times, there is a miraculous reversal in the action, and she ends up dominating Aaron and subduing him.  What then follows are 40 minutes of slow-moving scenes, pointless filler, flash-backs that seem like they might be from a different movie or storyline, bland dialogue, and a totally awful soundtrack.  There is eventually another fight scene between Mallory and Paul (Michael Fassbender), and it's the same I-almost-kill-you-but-you-miraculously-manage-to-turn-the-tables kind of fight.  It was just ridiculous, and it utterly strained credulity.<br /><br />Even though there are somebig names in this movie, it just isn't worth your time, and it certainly isn't worth your money.  If you feel compelled to see it, do yourself a favor and rent it first to see what I mean. I am usually pretty forgiving when watching movies, and I am willing to forgo things like character development and plot for good special effects and action, but this movie cannot claim credit for any of these things. It is utterly beyond me to understand how some people have posted 4- and 5-star reviews for this film. Their standards must be exceedingly low.
1451648537|3.0|There is a lot of information here and Jobs is an interesting subject, which I believe has carried this book to best seller and five star status.  Jobs died on October 5. The publication date is October 24.  Jobs' final days and the resulting recognition are not the only things missing.<br /><br />The book is arranged in segments which are related, but not completely tied. It makes for lots of gaps. You get pieces of his life, but you don't feel you know him as a whole person.<br /><br />For instance, regarding his family, his sister Patty's scant mention contrasts to sister Mona's coverage; his father, Paul, is well described in the beginning and all but disappears until p. 556 where from the verb tenses the reader can assume he has died.<br /><br />There are gaps in his business life as well. For instance he names his company Apple  on p.63, but his well-known and long term problem with the Beatles isn't mentioned until after page 400. Jobs' time at Pixar and his return to Apple overlap, but each role is covered in isolation, which makes more for a business history than a biography.<br /><br />Two traits, Jobs' temper and his diet, are constantly mentioned but not well explained. Both impact his daily life. It seems like he has some form of anorexia.  He has extraordinary and nasty bursts of temper which certainly contadicts the devotion to Buddhism he claims to have. Potential whys are only hinted at in the last chapter. While there may never be explanations, with Isaacson's access to Jobs, these topics should have been better covered.<br /><br />The timing of this book's publication filled the need of a world wide public to connect with Jobs as it mourned his death.  The book is adequate, but with the author's access to Jobs, is should have been great.<br /><br />I wonder what Jobs, who would a delay product launch, regardless of cost, until the product was perfect, would say about this.

B004SEUJ64|4.0|I knew that the codes for digital copies expire, with a general rule of thumb of one year from the date the disc is released. Amazon lists this product's release date as May 3, 2011, so that was just beyond that window, but figured I'd give it a shot. I already owned the DVD and just wanted to complete my Blu-ray collection, and besides, at the time of my order the Blu-ray only version and this bundle were only a few dollars apart.<br /><br />So in iTunes with the digital copy disc in the drive, I input the code and shockingly it worked!  I hadn't expected it to work since I had problems with the code from the X-Men (Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy) (2000) bundle.  (I'm going to follow-up with Customer Support one more time on that one...)<br /><br />I gave this product 4/5 stars because it is still a great bundled value. Although it can't compare to today's films such as Avengers, it still holds a valued spot in my collection as one of the early pioneers in the revival of the super hero movie genre.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|I have loved \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" since I read the book many year's ago. I have seen a few screen versions which I liked, but when I saw this version on PBS, I fell in love all over again! Since purchasing it, I have watched it numerous times and have loaned it to friends (who have now purchased it as well). Unfortunately I have never attended a stage version, but I hope to visit New York City to see it on Broadway. Excellent production as well as a superb cast! Ramin Karimloo, Sierra Boggess, Hadley Fraser to name a few! And of course Andrew LLoyd Weber is a musical genius! I highly reccomend this fantastic production!!!

Nothing in this book is sleazy, there is no network marketing, just solid work built on one's passion. And, the fruit of one's labor is freedom! Many wonderful case histories of people living happily doing work they love.

It's so hard for me to believe that a 20 minute daily work out can make a visible difference in just a few weeks. I really don't have weight to lose so I can't comment on weight loss with this video but I was in desperate need of shifting the weight and toning the flab! The thing that keeps me going on this video, unlike the other collection of videos that I own, is the fact that it is only 20 minutes!! I can fit in 20 minutes everyday and now that my kids have made comments about my minimized cellulite, I'm REALLY motivated. Another aspect of this video that I love is that all of the moves are 'doable' even for someone that isn't the most coordinated or limber, like me :) Jillian also has 2 girls working along with her in this video; One doing a modified lower impact version and the other doing the more difficult version. Jillian is also good about showing you the proper way to perform the moves and what NOT to do. It's the best $8 bucks I've spent. If you stick to it, you will be so pleased!
B001ESYAJY|5.0|Quantum of Solace is easily one of the best Bond scores ever, rivaling Arnold's own Casino Royale.  While many (including myself) were disappointed with the film, the score lives up to the high standards set by Arnold since Tomorrow Never Dies.  Tender, intriguing pieces like \\"Camille's Story\\" are punctuated by the characteristic and expected explosions of brass for action sequences like the opening \\"Time to Get Out.\\"  Arnold deftly handled the somewhat schizophrenic nature of the film with his variety of instrumentation and rhythm.  There is an abundance of complexity, nuance, and interweaving of themes that most action scores dare not dream of rivaling.  It's difficult to appreciate the sheer number of new and re-stated themes during casual listening, but the result is truly impressive.  The recording itself is very well mixed and sounds gorgeous on the proper equipment.<br /><br />As for the title song by Jack White, it is a one-star effort at best.  I hated every second of it, but its quality is irrelevant for the purposes of this review or this product page.  Other users are taking into account the mediocrity of the movie and/or the intro song when evaluating David Arnold's score, which is simply poor form.<br /><br />I'm absolutely stoked for Skyfall with Sam Mendes at the helm and Roger Deakins behind the camera, but I am rather miffed that Mendes chose long-time collaborator Thomas Newman to compose the score.  Newman is very talented, but I believe an odd choice to score a Bond film.  We shall see, but I believe Arnold's presence will be missed.

B004XJRQUQ|3.0|I was all hyped up to read all 3 books and by the 2nd book I was already built up in anticipation of the finale. The end was anticlimactic and felt like an abrupt end to the excitement building up to it. The concept of the trilogy is interesting and made it difficult to put down. The ending just did not have the impact that the books plot had a potential for. Almost as if Ms Collins just ran out of mojo in the end and had to whip up the ending really quick. I think most of us feel that the main protagonist President Snow should have had a more satisfying final encounter with Katniss than what was penned. I did not feel any closure for Katniss.
1846612950|5.0|FROM EXPERIENCED PRACTITIONERS TO LITIGANTS IN PERSON: A STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE TO JUDICIAL REVIEW<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />As Stephen Sedley reminds us in the Foreword to the second edition of this book, judicial review of governmental acts and omissions didn't even feature in the Bar examinations in the 1960s!<br /><br />Yet now, judicial review is `centre-stage in both legal theory and legal practice' -- and this is not the only distinctive aspect of judicial review. Another is the central and salient fact that in judicial review, it's the state that is usually one of the parties. Thus the purpose of judicial review, at least in theory, is to hold open the option for individuals to challenge the might of the state.<br /><br />From the signing of Magna Carta in 1215 -- as the authors point out in the preface -- the common law has developed (not without struggle) to protect fundamental rights and freedoms.  So it is curious that it's only within the last half century or so that judicial review has been formally instituted to uphold these rights.<br /><br />Judicial review, then, is intended to ensure that decisions made by the state that affect the lives of individuals -- or groups --are both democratic and lawful. The stated aim of the expert authors of this Guide, recently published by Jordans, has therefore been to assist access to judicial review on the part of individuals and their advisers.<br /><br />`We hope', they say, `that both experienced lawyers and litigants in person will be able to rely on this book to guide them through the process.'<br /><br />The book is divided into four parts.  The first - Law and Practice - guides the reader step by step though the complexities of the judicial review process, from initial instructions to appeals and ultimately, costs. As in many another legal process, costs are the caveat emptor and anyone contemplating a resort to judicial review should bear in mind the expense that is likely to ensue.<br /><br />Parts II, III and IV offer respectively, a procedural checklist, forms and precedents (twenty in all) and finally, a guide to the relevant legislation and protocol.<br /><br />The second edition cites a number of new developments in law and practice; developments in costs and funding being one of them. Other new material focuses on such issues as changes to appeals (CPR Part 52)... ongoing developments in case law... and new limitations in the context of immigration.<br /><br />These of course are only a few examples. As one would expect, this reliable, concise and readable work of reference contains extensive tables of cases, statutes, statutory instruments and European and international material, plus a 17-page index at the back.<br /><br />From students and academics, to experienced and inexperienced practitioners alike, anyone interested in this complex but fascinating subject -- or professionally involved in it -- should rush out and acquire this book as a matter of priority.  The law is stated as at 1 January 2012.hould bear in mind the expense that is likely to ensue.<br /><br />Parts II, III and IV offer respectively, a procedural checklist, forms and precedents (twenty in all) and finally, a guide to the relevant legislation and protocol.<br /><br />The second edition cites a number of new developments in law and practice; developments in costs and funding being one of them.

1423140591|3.0|Okay, let me start by saying that I have been a fan of Rick Riordan's books for about six years now, since around the time Sea of Monsters came out. I've read the old Percy Jackson series multiple times and am also following the Kane Chronicles. So naturally, a little over a year ago when Lost Hero came out I was ecstatic, and after borrowing it from my younger brother I was left with a feeling of disappointment. Not one to give up hope though, when Son of Neptune came out in October I had already pre-ordered it and upon arrival read the entire thing in about a day. At first, I was thrilled. The plot was exciting, the Roman Camp Jupiter and the minor characters were all incredibly interesting and full of personality, the new female protagonist, Hazel, was vastly more sympathetic and likable than Piper, and, best of all, Percy Jackson was back! But as a the next few days passed and I had time to mull over and digest what I had just read, the greater the problems I initially had with the book seemed to get, and additional flaws seemed to surface. So now, months later and immediately following a re-read, I'm reviewing The Son of Neptune.<br /><br />To start, the plot:<br /><br />Son of Neptune follows RR's standard formula: some event outside of camp takes place, demigod(s) go to camp and some quick event happens there, demigods get a quest and leave camp, demigods run into complications getting to their destination (monsters, detours, ect...), demigods get to destination and have a fight with the Big Bad of the week (book), demigods return to camp. Throughout the journey, readers are see events, objects, and people from Greek, and now Roman, mythology. Now I want to put out that this formula is not a bad thing, with the extensive mythology RR works with the plot always manages to stay vaguely interesting. There are two problems though. First, after so many novels of this, we know the characters are going to successfully complete their mission and all come out of it alive, so we never feel any suspense or strong excitement when they are \\"in danger\\", just a simple curiosity (if anything) in how they are going to get out of it. Second, at least a quarter of the events Percy, Hazel, and Frank go through on their quest seem completely inconsequential to the plot of SoN, let alone the overarching series' plot. Some fans thought that these chapters were funny, I personally found them rather dull, and a waste of paper.<br /><br />I will admit that the events that happened at Camp Jupiter were all highly entertaining, and were mostly relevant to the book and series as a whole and those that weren't were at least decent examples of world-building. Riordan does seem to be attempting to make romance a more essential plot point this time, which can be either something you love or hate, but unfortunately (for me at least), there is actually more going on there than in the gods v. giants-good v. evil department. It also seems to be a mix and match version of other RR novels' plots; the quest is a rescue mission (like in Sea of Monsters, Titan's Curse, and The Lost Hero), the characters face off against \\"evil\\" people working for the main Big Bad (like in TLH), and fight two giants (again like in TLH) all the while racing against the clock. And there are continuity errors: you know how in TLH it was December and Percy had been missing three days? In Son of Neptune it's mentioned multiple times that he (and Jason) went missing around October, or \\"eight months ago\\". In a series were time and deadlines matter so much, this is a major problem. My overall grade: 2/5<br /><br />Next, the main Characters (I'll attempt to avoid spoilers but I've always been really bad a gauging what constitutes one):<br /><br />1) Percy: well, he's back. In third person, which can be a hurdle for PJatO fans to get over, but he is basically the same guy. Still incredibly powerful, loyal, goofy, and with the same sense of humor (though it is muffled by the third person and amnesia). His interaction with Octavian is hilarious, and he and Hazel definitely seem to be developing a brother-sister relationship. The connection to Reyna is fascinating, and all the references to the PJatO books are a nice bonus for long-time fans. The way he immediately beings to think of the Roman camp as home and family is totally in line with his character, but while I found it touching, others (especially those who prefer Camp Half-Blood) may find it startling and annoying. Really my only complaint is the over-stressing and portrayal of his relationship with Annabeth; who he remembers as, not one of his best and oldest friends, but as his girlfriend. They were only dating a few months before he was kidnapped by Hera/Juno, and yet he's actively considering starting a family with her in this novel and thinking \\"romantic\\" (gushy) thoughts about her- only one of which was about her personality, ambitions, and/or interests- and almost all of which were Out of Character for people who have read the first series. Percabeth shippers will find his thoughts and comments delightful, of course, but they'll be an annoyance for anyone who dislikes the pairing or Annabeth, or is ambivalent about Annabeth or Percabeth. Finally, he doesn't really get any character development (for those who have read the first series- those who are beginning with Heroes of Olympus might find him one of the best developed characters), but based on what the gods, Gaia, and giants are saying, he's going to be going through a rough time in the next three books that'll give him plenty of opportunity to grow. Overall grade: 4/5<br /><br />2)Hazel: the female character. Okay, so apparently everyone in the new series most be related biologically to someone else, and Hazel is no exception. Luckily, she breaks from the stereotype of what people imagine kids of this god to be like without becoming an antithesis of that god's values and role, and the relationship with her sibling seems genuinely loving (though it does undo some of the character development said sibling got in the previous series). Her powers are, like other members of the seven, insanely strong, but seem to have a downside (she accurately dubs it a curse) which helps make her more relatable, though we never see this curse harming her, the quest, or her allies except in flashbacks. Her flashbacks, which could have been a huge liability if they happened in the middle of a battle, or could have been used to create brilliant tension and genuine conflict, are only used as info-dump sessions and RR conveniently makes them disappear completely after he's finished telling us her back story. But she is far less boy-crazed than Piper, and seems to acknowledge and seek to rectify mistakes she makes. She doesn't seem to have any (in-universe-acknowledged) flaws though, which are what make characters people. Overall grade: 3/5<br /><br />3)Frank: the final third. Let me put this out there: by the end of my first read-through, I disliked Frank. That opinion hasn't changed in the seven months. I thought he was overpowered even by the seven's standards, and the only way he can be redeemed in my eyes is if that plot-device stick Riordan uses in place of developing actual flaws with Frank ends up burning and Frank dies (spoiler: this doesn't happen in SoN). The guy started out fine; un-claimed, clumsy, awkward, legion outcast with low-self esteem and not really good at anything except archery. Then, as the novel progresses, we see those flaws don't affect anything or are just Frank complaining (which he does a lot). Furthermore he learns to use his special ability in the space of days when the rest of the characters needed months, even years, to reach an equivalent skill level. For someone who likes consistency in their series, this is incredibly frustrating. What are things I actually enjoyed about him? Well he does make some good jokes, and I did enjoy his chapters at first (until about half-way through the book actually). Overall grade: 2/5.<br /><br />Gaia: I find her personally more intimidating after this book, but considering her threat level seemed laughable in The Lost Hero, that's not saying much. Her plan has interested me though, and the way she interacts differently with each hero and the various ways she attempts to manipulate them were fascinating. Overall Grade: 2/5<br /><br />Side Characters:<br /><br />The Gods: As always, they stole whatever seen they appeared in and managed to be some of the best characters in the book. Some major gods from the last series even received a bit of character development. Overall grade: 5/5<br /><br />Reyna: By the end of the novel we still don't know much about her, but she still manages to be one of the best written characters in the novel. Her personality is fairly complex and her priorities seem to be straight, and every bit of her dialogue flows smoothly- which is saying something as at times dialogue felt very forced in this book. Overall grade: 5/5<br /><br />Octavian: This guy was brilliant. I would totally read an entire book just about him. His interactions with Percy were hilarious, and his dealings with the senate and Reyna had me surprised (that Riordan would write a morally grey character like this) and hopeful, as those scenes tended to be well written. Yet I fear that we were supposed to dislike this character, not be amused by him (he's obviously set up to be an antagonist). Still, it gives me hope. Overall Grade: 4/5 (because if an author attempts to set up a potential villain- definitely at least an antagonist- I should not like him more than the main characters).<br /><br />Everyone Else: 2/5. Really, there's not much to say, besides Dakota and one of Gaia's servants everyone else was barely developed. More like moving, talking background to be honest. None of them even get last names! This wouldn't be a problem, except we're supposed to dislike the giants (and see them as threats to our protagonists) and like Dakota and Gwen and the amazons. Except by the end, nothing. They're just there, and I can't care about characters aren't developed more than the bare shells of stereotypes. Really, the only reason this wasn't a 1/5 was Dakota, one of the giants, and the previously mentioned servant.<br /><br />And finally the last part: the writing itself! Overall, it wasn't bad. There were definitely parts where sentences should have been joined together and the writing could seem choppy at times. I could always tell who was narrating though. Riordan should also invest in a thesaurus because he repeated select words a lot, and sentences should have varied in length more. He also needs to use far less \\"he\\"s and \\"she\\"s. Overall Grade: 3/5.<br /><br />So there's my lengthy criticism of the next book from an author I've been reading for years. Were there problems? Obviously I think so. Does that mean I didn't enjoy it? Not in the slightest; I enjoyed nearly every minute and will probably re-read it in autumn before Mark of Athena (the next book in the series) comes out. Should you read it? That depends, I think. If you liked The Lost Hero, you would probably actually enjoy this a lot more than I did, so you should certainly read it. And if you have read and enjoyed Percy Jackson and the Olympians then it's probably worth a shot, but if you didn't like The Lost Hero (whether you have read the Percy Jackson series or not) I would recommend reading the sample chapter and basing your purchase off how much you enjoyed that. It pretty much sets the level for all of Percy's chapters, which make up a third of the book. Anyone who hasn't read The Lost Hero or the Percy Jackson books: go read one of them. I recommend The Lightning Thief, but in the end it's up to you. I hope this has been of some help.ing (though it does undo some of the character development said sibling got in the previous series).

B003XRELGQ|4.0|I enjoyed this subversive, satirical, nihilistic, and absurd novel. It is definitely a bit odd and won't be for everyone. Historically speaking, mankind has done some catastrophically stupid things.  I'm not sure Vonnegut would agree, but I think there is still hope for humanity.<br /><br />My favorite quote from the book:  \\"What makes you think a writer isn't a drug salesman?\\"

B004X8W468|4.0|It's hard to classify this book into a particular genre. Ultimately, this is a book about a girl during the late 70's learning to navigate friendship, life in the 6th grade, and the quirks of living in NYC. Plus, there is a bit of mystery and a lot of references to time travel a`la A Wrinkle in Time. As I enjoyed that series when I was younger, the allusions to the book were fun.<br /><br />Although this book was geared toward a younger audience, I have to say I really enjoyed it. The voice was authentic for a twelve year old, and the pace was perfect. I also like the general description of Miranda's life, the semi-autonomy that she had for a kid growing up in the 70's that is different from the way most children grow up today. It just rang true for me. I loved her mom's rules for life in the city and Miranda's own tactics she employs. Although I did guess the mystery long before the end, it didn't bother me in the least. The book was charming, clever, and satisfying.
B001EN71CW|5.0|3200+ other reviews have already said it: This is best science fiction television series ever made.<br /><br />Firefly, which I didn't see until it was off the air, was originally recommended to me by a group of serious Heinlein fans whose opinion I value. They weren't wrong. Firefly achieved in three episodes the level of world creation and characters that took original Star Trek nearly three seasons to reach. Firefly has strong shades of Heinlein in it, in all the best ways. Read Heinlein's \\"[[ASIN:1439133212 Between Planets]]\\" to see what a young Mal Reynolds fighting his revolution might be like. Heinlein's great novel about slavery, \\"[[ASIN:1416505520 Citizen of the Galaxy]]\\" will show you the Alliance worlds with their rich and powerful enslaving those beneath. And, of course, you'll see Inara in Heinlein's character Tamara, in \\"[[ASIN:0441810764 Time Enough for Love]].\\" Cowboys, horses, and spaceships all mixed together? Heinlein was there long since. If you're a Firefly fan who hasn't yet read Heinlein, I envy you. You have a wondrous reading adventure awaiting you. And I dare say Heinlein, who was a big Star Trek fan, would love Firefly, too.<br /><br />This richness of world creation, with Joss Whedon's brilliance in casting, dialog, and directing, all go in to making Firefly the wonderful story and show it is. If you like Heinlein, if you like Star Trek, if you like good science fiction in any form, you will almost certainly fall in love with Firefly and, with the rest of us, mourn that it ended far too soon.<br /><br />As for whether you should get the DVDs versus the Blu-Rays...<br /><br />I have had both and watched both on big screen high def televisions. I am a little sad to say the Blu-rays weren't worth the upgrade. If you already have the DVD set, it's not, in my opinion, worth getting the Blu-rays expecting a major improvement in the look of the video. With \\"Lord of the Rings\\" the difference was stunning. The Blu-ray video was gorgeous, a substantial step up from the DVDs. With Firefly, it's more hit-and-miss. Some of the video is better with the Blu-rays, but not all of it, and some of the video flaws are more apparent with the Blu-rays than with the DVDs. It's not a consistent improvement in quality.tial step up from the DVDs. With Firefly, it's more hit-and-miss.

0375842209|5.0|This is a deeply moving book with a unique narrative style.  This is definitely one of my favorite books.  The take on the Holocaust from a different perspective was unique. It is sad, but very moving.
0545091020|4.0|Most of my students had read this one, and several of my co-workers, and the premise sounded interesting, so I decided to give it a try. I'm very glad I did! This is the best book I've read so far this year. It wasn't perfect; a few things seemed to come a little too easily for Katniss, but overall it was a really fun read and I look forward to reading the rest of the series.<br /><br />One thing I have to comment on was the grosling Katniss killed and ate during the game. She commented once that it was all gone, but then she kept eating it for a few chapters afterward. That took me out of the story a little every time.<br /><br />Collins did a great job with the ending. It's very frustrating and I can't imagine how people didn't go berserk when the book first came out and they had to wait a year to pick up the story.<br /><br />Don't push this one aside thinking it's another Twilight. The writing is very good, the story engaging, and the characters well developed.
1439127700|5.0|Full disclosure. I bought this for my dad so I am writing based on his reaction. He calls or email every day to tell me something else he learned from the book. Dad is a political junkie and he said he did not know most of what is in this book. He is enjoying is so much he is trying to slow down his reading to make it last longer. This is one of the best gifts I ever got for him.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Latest update for my Verizon Droid is slow and causes multiple \\"Force Close\\" messages.  If I wait long enough and get it to the book I want to read it burns down my battery.  I can feel it getting hot while reading.  It slows the phone down so much that I can't even answer a call if it is running.  Exiting the APP takes forever, to the point I have to restart the phone to get back to normal. Please fix this latest revision (3.5.1.1).

Some of the songs are so amazing they bring you to tears. I've seen the musical on stage and this DVD made me feel as though I was there again. And the ensemble number at the end with past cast members was to die for.

B00702NWW4|4.0|Let me begin by stating that my music taste is quite broad. I enjoy Rage Against the Machine as well as Florence & The Machine so I am generally a fan of anything that is not the polka, The Black Eyed Peas, or God-forbid The Black Eyed Peas interpreting polka.<br /><br />The best compliment that I can give the album is that you can listen to it all the way through without skipping tracks (even the deluxe edition). Her vocals are certainly not Earth-shattering but they serve the sound-scape well and in no way detract from the listener's enjoyment. I suppose the Lolita-esq lyrical accompaniment adds to the mood, but as a grown man I sometimes feel like I am jamming along with the deposition from a statutory rape trial. Also, you do not want to be caught by a coworker singing along with:<br /><br />\\"I'm in his favorite sun dress<br />Watching me get undressed<br />Take that body downtown\\"<br /><br />However, any lyrical shortcomings could arguably be offset by the album's Pabst Blue Ribbon shout-out.<br /><br />She does bravely addresses a diverse array of topics like:<br /><br />Seasonal Affective Disorder - (Summertime Sadness)<br />Gender Identity - (This Is What Makes Us Girls)<br />Carnal Patriotism - (National Anthem)<br />Emotional Bankruptcy - (Million Dollar Man)<br />Caloric Moderation - (Diet Mountain Dew)<br /><br />And just so there is no buyer's regret, the song \\"Radio\\" is not a heartfelt homage to the Cuba Gooding Jr. film of the same name.

After one day going wheat free, a dozen symptoms began improving, including hunger, bloating, big wheat belly, indigestion, painful joints, fatigue, mental fog, etc.  I was not sick, but was nowhere near well and things were going downhill.  Now, after 5 days gluten free, I have lost weight effortlessly, am rarely hungry, have a ton of energy, sleep well, do not ache, and know I can comfortably continue this way for life.  If full health feels like a \\"10\\", I've been muddling along at about a \\"4\\" for over a decade.  In just five days, I feel like a \\"7\\" again and know I'm still climbing.<br /><br />Having yo-yo dieted for many years, always struggling to control my appetite, I have learned that the problem was wheat and not me!  I also find it easy to skip the grains now that:  1) I am not hungry or craving, and 2) I have felt such improvement from removing them that I know they are poison for me.<br /><br />This book is the genuine breakthrough to solve our obesity problem and lower health costs.  The medical establishment can be slow to catch on, and food and farm lobbies powerful when motivated to resist.  So it could take a while for the 'experts' to stop advising us to eat lots of \\"healthy whole grains\\".  We must do ourselves a favor:  read this book!  It has changed my life for the better - enormously - in just a few days.  I'm sure many others will experience similar benefits.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|I cannot stress this enough...these books are not written for teens or young adults who might be easily influenced.<br /><br />Well, after skimming through other reviews of Fifty Shades of Grey on Goodreads, I admit to being a little nervous in writing this review. Quite honestly, outside of a full-on book report, book reviewing is a subjective matter, meaning that what appeals to me, might not appeal to you and vice versa...that being said, I, personally, enjoyed EL James' writing, often finding myself laughing out loud because of humor or the sheer absurdity of any given situation.<br /><br />When you take time to stop and think, how many of the books you read are, or are destined to be, classic literary works of art? I understand that most of what I read is a type of pop-culture and serves, at best, as a lovely escape and form of immense entertainment. The same thing can be said about movies and television but rarely do these two cause as much heated debate and mud-slinging as books do. I wonder why that is?<br /><br />So, what can I tell you about Fifty Shades of Grey that you don't already know. Very little, I'd guess. Yes, it was originally written as fan-fic based around the Twilight Series. A very adult piece of fan-fic, I'll give you, but fan-fic all the same. Christian, a control-freak, ego-maniac, falls for Anastasia, a plain looking, clumsy college student. Remind you of another love/hate couple?<br /><br />Anastasia, quite literally, stumbles into Christian Grey's office on a mission for her school newspaper. Her roommate, the editor, is ill and Ana is forced to interview the illusive and powerful businessman in Kate's place. The first words out of Ana's mouth lead Mr. Grey to believe that Ana is a natural submissive. He stalks her, traces her cell phone, and becomes easily angered when other men come near Ana and this is all before his proposed relationship...if that's even what you could call such an arrangement. He couldn't be more wrong, and much to his surprise, he likes Ana's feistiness and smart mouth. He likes that she challenges him.<br /><br />Unlike Bella, Anastasia doesn't go leaping into anything head first. She listens to Christian's proposal and does her research before deciding to give his \\"lifestyle\\" a chance. It doesn't take either of them long to figure out she's not cut out to be a submissive and could it be that Christian actually wants something other than what he's always had? Ana's realization and walk-of-shame out of his life may be the thing Christian needs to control his inner control-freak. What a conundrum!<br /><br />Yes, this book is taking over the media. Yes, I gave into the hype and read it. Yes, I saw the similarities between this novel and Twilight. Yes, I am a Twilight fanatic and I'm not ashamed. Yes, I also enjoyed reading E.L. James' writing and Christian and Ana's relationship. The book picked up pace significantly when the highly acclaimed e-mails began flying back and forth between the couple. I kind of loved that Ana could be so honest with Christian from behind a computer screen. Reminded me a little of myself and, before we judge, aren't we all a little braver when cloaked?<br /><br />Would I recommend Fifty Shades of Grey to my friends? Only with a strong cautionary warning about the amount of, not only sexual content, but also of the BDSM content. Also, Christian is fervently screwed in the head...I haven't figured it all out yet, but I suspect his childhood sucked the normalness out of him, because while he's drop dead, smoldering sexy, he is also demented.<br /><br />While I always love comments, and I do, please follow the Golden Rule and do as you would have done to you. I always encourage thoughtful and polite debate...our differences ARE what makes the world a more interesting place, so embrace them and respect them...ALWAYS.

0439023513|4.0|I loved the series, but I was a little disappointed with the ending of it.  Overall, though, Collins is a great writer; her prose flows effortlessly and it's easy to imagine the scenes she creates.
0812550706|5.0|I'm a grad student, and I don't have a lot of time for leisure reading. A friend recommended this book years ago, it sat collecting dust for over a year before I read the first chapter, I didn't put it down after that. In fact, I've read every book in the series now, became a fan of the complimentary comic series as well.  I love the series and I'm eagerly awaiting the next book release. Believe me, I've never stuck to any book series, this series is excellent.
0071636080|3.0|So, this must be something like the 5th or 6th book I've read on how to be a better presenter.  The tips here are good, but tend to be a bit repetitive, and there's one major drawback to this particular book that left me scratching my head, but let's go over the pros and cons...<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1) Even though the book revolves around Steve Jobs and his presentation style, numerous examples of other presenters and presentations by other people are given.  This is good, as using Steve Jobs as the sole example source would be a bit of a one note symphony.<br /><br />2) The author breaks up the book and the associated tips for better presentations in a logical way with nice headings that when compiled sort of make a \\"hit list\\" of tips for better presenting.<br /><br />3) Relating the suggestions back to concrete examples of Jobs' various presentations is helpful, and luckily with Steve Jobs almost every presentation he ever gave is archived on the internet for posterity so given enough time, the reader could look them up and watch them \\"in the flesh\\" so to speak.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1) Most of the tips are things I've read in other books on good presentation giving.  While Steve did raise the act of presentation giving to an art, the actual things he did to get there are known and nothing earth shattering, so I can't say I learned much that was new here.  If this is the first book you pick up on presenting, then you're likely to find some very good things you can use.  If it's not, then the utility is likely to be somewhat diminished.<br /><br />2) In all honesty, I found the book to be very repetitive.  Or maybe it's just that you can only reference the introduction of the iPhone or the original Mac about 3 times before you've used up all of the useful information.  I think this is one of those cases where the book could have actually been about half as long as it was and would have been just fine and saved some trees to boot.  I sometimes think that authors and publishers shoot for a certain number of pages just so that we all feel like we're getting our money's worth.  This might be one of those cases.<br /><br />3) The largest drawback, and the one that I just can't figure out however, is that Jobs' incredible presentations were always reduced to transcripts in table form instead of shown as actual images, which is just plain confusing and disappointing.  I'm not sure if the presentations are copyrighted by Apple and therefore couldn't be reproduced or what, but it certainly detracts from the usefulness of the book.  If you think you'd benefit from actual images of examples, and I'm sure you would, then I'd suggest one of Gar Reynolds' books or Nancy Duarte's books, either of which have beautiful color pictures of real presentations as opposed to this book which is 99% text with a few black and white photos and NO images of actual slides from a Jobs presentation.  It seemed so crazy to me that I actually thought I must have missed a section with images of slides or something so I actually flipped through the book again.  Nope.  Eight or so pictures of Jobs holding up a mac or whatever, but NO slide images.  NOT ONE.  Seems a bit counter to the message to have a book on presentations where one of the major points is to use as little text as possible, but yet which doesn't show actual presentation images, and instead replaces them with bland tables of textual descriptions.  I'm sure there's some technical or legal reason for that, but it just seems bizarre and wrong somehow and it just left me feeling like I wanted more.<br /><br />I mean, all in all, it's not a bad book.  The tips and pointers are good, especially if this is your first book on the subject.  The information is organized well, it's a quick and easy read, and you couldn't pick a better subject to study for good presentation giving than Steve Jobs.  However, if you're a visual learner, then you'd be better off looking elsewhere, and if you've read other books on presentation giving (Beyond Bullet Points, Presentation Zen, Slide:ology, etc.) then you probably won't learn much of anything new here.  For me, it reinforced what I'd already learned elsewhere, but didn't add much if any new information.  I was left not necessarily dissatisfied, only mildly inspired, and sort of disappointed by the lack of concrete images from Jobs' actual presentations.<br /><br />3 stars for good information, but I'm taking two away for the lack of real Jobs' presentation images, and I think the book would have been much, much better if it were less textual, and much more graphical (ala. Slide:ology or Presentation Zen.)  Granted, those books cost twice as much, but they're also three times as nice to read...ad other books on presentation giving (Beyond Bullet Points, Presentation Zen, Slide:ology, etc.) then you probably won't learn much of anything new here.

B003Y5H5EW|4.0|The movie is outstanding ONLY IF they make another movie.  The movie is way too short to be a stand alone movie and it creates questions which are not answered, as in: What's up with Michael?  Selene and Michael get captured in the beginning of the movie; Selene escapes and haises holy hell; Michael gets loose at the end of the movie, but does not reunite with Selene.  The movie would be a great lead-in for a fifth movie, but is disappointing if this is where the series stops.

B005LAIGN2|3.0|\\"We will not go away, we have a right to fight for our country the same as every other American. So you shut us down or you let us fly.\\" The true story of the Tuskegee Airmen, an all African-American fighter pilot division during WWII. After coming to the brink of being scrapped their Colonel A.J. Bullard (Howard) fights to keep them together. It is up to them to prove themselves. I will start by saying that I thought this movie was OK and not worth most of the bad reviews it has gotten. That said the dialog is terrible and almost ruined the movie. If you have seen the \\"Star Wars\\" movie you will know what I mean when I say the action carried the movie but no one talks the way the do in this movie in real life. The plane fights were fun to watch but when someone spoke it really ruined the moment and took a while to get the excitement back. The movie reminded me more of \\"Pearl Harbor\\" then \\"Flyboys\\". I do think this is worth watching, but it would be better if it was on mute. Overall, an entertaining movie with awful dialog. I give it a B-.

B004LROUW2|5.0|The title of my review is as it says -- one of the greatest books I have ever read. To think that I stumbled upon it by clicking an ad on a Lady Gaga forum! Who would've ever known.<br /><br />I am not much of a fantasy reader, but this book was absolutely fantastic with a world painted so beautifully and captivating in every single way. With a slow-medium pace, the book might not be for everyone. However, the characters are so fantastic that you continue reading more as the plot thickens before you realize it. If Murakami's other books are anything like this one, call me a fan; this book has undoubtedly changed my ideas of fiction and is truly a captivating, unbelievable journey with an almost tragic love story at heart.<br /><br />I'd recommend the book to anyone; it has the right amount of action, tension, and pace for any reader. Having multiple point of views between a male and female character makes the book accessible to both genders -- Murakami really does know how to write like a master. Please read 1Q84, if you are looking for a breathtaking story that spans all time and space. However, keep in mind that you're in for some very whacky and almost metaphorical symbols throughout the book. Very deep and takes a bit of thinking. If that's your style, go for it!

0060873027|5.0|With Micro, Richard Preston crafted a worthy follow-up to Prey, Michael Crichton's science fiction/fact about nanomachines and the chaos they can/will bring into our present-day world. Preston expanded Cricton's vision to the next level of \\"what if\\" placing people into the DON'T TOUCH THAT machine. Of course, they touch it! The science is solid. What differentiates Preston's vision from that of Crichton's are the characters. Usually, Crichton signals through the use of ethical dilemmas and moral outrage who the readers should root for and who will likely live to die another day. Preston upended that black/white world into shades of gray, at times causing the reader to feel compassion for the unfairness of who lives and who dies, but also keeping the suspense tight.

0345803485|1.0|I work in a bookstore and was curious about the new bestselling romance saga that was perpetually sold out.  Reading the first book, however, left me baffled.  Of all the books that struggling authors fight to get published, Twilight fanfiction becomes a bestseller? This book is Twilight erotica without the vampires.  The female lead is awkward, criminally clumsy, and whines constantly.  The first several pages of the book are nothing but her whining about how her best friend is sick, and feeling very unattractive.  She's Bella Swan in college.  As for Christian, he's constantly described as an Adonis, can play piano, and was adopted by wealthy parents.  He's gorgeous and is wanted by every woman, but takes special interest in Anastasia for no particular reason.  He's Edward Cullen, right down to telling Ana to stay away for her own good to avoid being hurt by his inner monster.  The book is even set in Washington State.<br /><br />Other than being Twilight fanfiction but with different names, the writing is poor and ridiculously repetitive. I think James was trying to set a word record for repetitive phrases. How many times can one book mention murmuring, flushing, lip-biting, and saying \\"crap?\\" The characters are unlikable and boring, and a lot of their interaction is done through email which is just as much fun to read as your own email. Overall, the whole thing comes off as if it was written by a child who just discovered that BDSM was a thing, as she constantly compares Christian to being some sort of monster for liking it.  At one point, Ana even thinks of him as a dark knight which, as a Batman fan, caused me to throw the book against my wall.  If you're curious, stay away! You may get some laughs or cheap thrills from this book, but there are much better romances out there. I can't even fully recommend it for laughs, as many parts were painful to read.  Skip this series!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Is it news to everyone that this is an erotic novel? After reading a handful of reviews, I'd say people were truly shocked to hear that this was indeed an erotic novel. Erotic novels have been written for centuries. If you are not interested in reading an erotic novel, then don't. It really is as simple as that. For every negative comment written there is a counter comment praising it. That said. This is my review on \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\".<br />E.L. James has captured every woman's fantasy in three books. Hello, Mr. Tall-Dark-Handsome-Mysterious. Her smooth writing style made it impossible for me to put these books down(3 in 3 days). The author's description of each character really brings them to life, you are immediately transported into the world of Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey. Erotic, yes. Trashy, no. All in all, if you take out the sex, it's just a wonderfully written love story. A friend asked me to describe it in one word. My answer, \\"Twisted\\". E.L. James is also a TV screenwriter and I think her adaptability really shows in these books. I guarantee you will enjoy reading this book as much as I have. It's taken every ounce of self-control not to pick it up and read again!
1603429999|5.0|This book is a must have for those who want to know more about knitting in the round. It is beautifully laid out, the color illustrations are super, there are simple explanations, good detail and many step-by-step lessons. Socks are explained simply (for those of you who are afraid of dbl. pointed needles) and there is a great section on finishing techniques. Everything is illustrated. I think it is a \\"must have\\" for any knitter's library. The price is very reasonable considering the content. It's well indexed and altogether a GREAT knitting book.I wasn't expecting something this good for the price.Plus I received it (to rural Canada) in 3 days! You will not be disappointed!

B007Q2N0HA|4.0|What was I thinking reading this book. Now I have to wait until October to read the second book. I'm going to have a very hard time waiting. Obviously I really liked this book. The writing was excellent, as well as the story. I saw very few similarities to Fifty Shades. Eva in Bared to you comes from money, takes control and has her own set of issues. Gideon has issues too but isn't as controlling and can be very sweet. I thought this book was a bit more believable than 50. But you can't really say this book is a rip off of Fifty Shades because Christian Grey isn't the only F'd up Bazillionare out there in Cont. Erotic Romance land. Highly recommend this book. It was very easy to read and I read it so fast despite the 300+ pages.
B00371QQ0M|5.0|I've seen this film many times over the years and am thrilled to finally own my own copy.  Before purchasing the Blu-ray here, I carefully read many reviews and was surprised to read of missing footage, very slow load-time and rather annoying menu features.  Well, hardcore fans may find the new features annoying, but I quickly adapted, was easily able to get directly to the film with no waiting, and actually found myself liking the new menu and additional footage in no time at all.  I don't entirely disagree with those who say that greater care could've been taken in preparing this sci-fi classic for Blu-ray format.  I will only say that if you loved the film in 1984,(or later) you'll most likely enjoy this Blu-ray disc just as much.  There is really very little truly \\"missing footage\\" noticed during the movie.  Said footage is explained and even shown in detail (if desired) at the end of the film.  Those who complain that this disc, and its extras were \\"rushed\\" or \\"of poor quality\\" should remember that films do age, and even the best enhancement technology does have limits.  Dune is truly a love it or hate it film.  I happen to love it, as always, and hope that any \\"extended edition\\" or \\"director's cut\\" available will also be released on blu-ray very soon.

B007EC6FIS|4.0|I'd been anticipating Keane's next album since they released Night Train back in 2010. Their track record of having a record out every 2 years (starting back '04 with Hopes and Fears), made me expect there'd be a new one out in 2012.<br />It was definitely worth the wait, for me. I was a little disappointed with Perfect Symmetry, only because it had stretched beyond what I thought was the perfect sound with Under The Iron Sea.<br />With Strangeland, it's definitely a throwback of sorts to those first two albums, but with all the lessons and skills that Keane's learned since then.<br />It's not a gamechanger, and it's not a trainwreck, but it's definitely a great listen through and through.

B005LAIHIQ|4.0|I was a big fan of the original show back in my high school years.  I was madly in love with Lara Parker's Angelique. Yes, she was totally evil, but one look into those big blue eyes and I forgave her for everything.<br /><br />One month ago I bought a limited edition set of the entire series and started watching from the beginning, at the rate of about 10 episodes per day (I'm retired, so I have the time to do this) and I'm enjoying it all over again (although I have yet to reach the point at which I started watching it in the first place in November 1967).<br /><br />That being said, I saw the movie yesterday and greatly enjoyed it. The trailer made the mistake of focusing solely on the sillier elements of the film and skipping all the better parts.  I found it to be far more respectful of the source material than the trailer indicated, with many references that only a fan would recognize (like young Maggie Evans getting carted off to Windcliff Sanitarium).  Even the over-the-top revelations during the final conflict refer to some of the many weird storylines that occurred in Collinwood over the show's run.  Eva Green looked like she was having a ball as the delightfully wicked and passionate \\"Angie.\\"<br /><br />Dark Shadows is ultimately an inconsequential bit of entertainment, but it was a lot of fun and gorgeous to look at.<br /><br />But there will never be an Angelique like Lara Parker, still beautiful even in her seventies as can be seen in the brief view of her entering the party along with Jonathan Frid, David Selby, and Kathryn Leigh Scott (also still very attractive).
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|Slickly produced and nicely animated. Of the &quot;Professor Layton&quot; variety, where puzzles aren't connected to the thin (and fairly disposable plot). Plays well with my Asus Transformer Prime.

B006Z7Z3S6|3.0|SCTV fans will recall Joe Flaherty's portrayal of Count Floyd, the vampire host of late night's \\"Monster Chiller Horror Theater.\\"<br /><br />The good Count was tasked with hyping the scariness of the most dreadful B movies to gullible children viewers.<br /><br />Well, Count Floyd would have been hard pressed to sell the almost nonexistent scares in \\"The Innkeepers.\\"<br /><br />Though this little independent movie features realistic dialog and fine performances, notably from Sara Paxton and Kelly McGillis as an innkeeper and one of her last guests, it barely moves the needle on the chill meter.<br /><br />One of the problems here is that a good haunted house movie needs a scary house in an isolated location.  \\"The Innkeepers\\" offers neither, as the Yankee Pedlar Inn is rather a handsome old place, located smack on the main street of some town in Connecticut.<br /><br />I will admit that the \\"Paranormal Activity\\" movies produced plenty of goosebumps with protagonists residing in normal suburban homes.  Nevertheless the scares in those movies were so carefully modulated -- and the dangers to the characters so palpable -- that those films did get under my skin.<br /><br />Here the tone of suspense is never properly developed or sustained.  I never felt that the nerd boy and girl innkeepers are in any real danger, or even that they -- or the audience -- would care very much if they are.<br /><br />The question has also been raised, are there real ghosts in this movie, or just figments of the characters' imaginations?  The movie tries to walk a fine line between real and imagined ghosts, but there are a few hints that the ghosts here are real, which is always preferable to products of hysteria or a psychotic butler in the attic.<br /><br />The DVD does include some decent extras -- a brief making-of featurette and not one but two commentary tracks.<br /><br />But I really doubt most horror fans will consider \\"The Innkeepers\\" a keeper.  This earnest but underwhelming film can barely hold a bell, book, or candle to the original \\"The Haunting,\\" \\"The Legend of Hell House,\\" or even the recent \\"Woman in Black.\\"<br /><br />Those are the haunted house movies that belong on a collector's shelf; accept NO substitutes!can barely hold a bell, book, or candle to the original \\"The Haunting,\\" \\"The Legend of Hell House,\\" or even the recent \\"Woman in Black.\\"<br /><br />Those are the haunted house movies that belong on a collector's shelf; accept NO substitutes!

B005DOKL3E|1.0|I returned my Kindle Fire Zip Sleeve after opening the package. It's a ridiculous design and very inconvenient to use. It would work much better if it fit like a book cover instead of only opening halfway.  The price was also way too exspensive for something that didn't protect the Kindle at all times. I absoultly do not recommend this product!

1400069289|5.0|Before I read this book, I read the reviews. And indeed, some of the one star reviews were right - you could get the gist on a personal level from interviews with the author. But this book was about so much more than just changing personal habits. What struck me the most was the section about how companies use habits - ours. It made me very hesitant about giving my zip code and then using my credit/debit card.  This section also made me aware of my buying \\"habits\\". And yes, I have looked a little different at my own personal habits.

B007BWUIHA|5.0|I saw all five re-issues in person and am peeved that the original prints weren't use to re-create these album images.  Like a Prayer suffered the worst from this because the cover looks blurry and lifeless.  I was most excited to get this one since \\"Like A Prayer\\" was the first album I purchased (back in 1989).  This reissue also clearly didn't have any patchouli splashed on it.<br />In second place, Like A Virgin doesn't have the same tint as the original cover and is much darker.  The image on the back is also no longer flipped upside down but is now right side up which didn't keep with the original album lay-out.<br /><br />With that said, the best looking re-issues happen to be \\"True Blue\\" and \\"Erotica.\\"  Lastly, the \\"Madonna\\" album seems to have an improved cover due to the brightening of the image which made it look much better sitting next to the original 1983 issue.

B0050DIWFC|2.0|Terrible book.  I only finished it because it was assigned for book club.  Bad writing with a sketchy plot.  It makes it worse that it was received such high reviews on Amazon.  Disappointing.
B007BWUK3W|4.0|I have this record in-hand.  Though this re-issue doesn't have the parental advisory label on it, it is the full 14 track version with \\"Did You Do It\\"<br />The cover image was already grain and so you really can't tell from this reprint that they didn't use the original prints to make this record.<br />The same can't be said for some of the other re-issues.  Like a Virgin and Like A Prayer are blurry disasters and quite disappointing while True Blue seems to be the best looking in the series and the original Madonna album looks almost better with the lighting change on the front image.<br />Anyway, back to this record.<br />Erotica is the only record in this 2012 vinyl re-issue series that comes in a thick gate-fold sleeve.  It's thick heavy and just looks wonderful.<br />The back of the album with the \\"toe-suck\\" image looks a bit more on the blurry side and I can't help be annoyed that in the credits at the bottom there are two years listed. The correct year 1992 (when this album came out) and the in-correct year 1989.  I'm being overly anal but just didn't like seeing that year listed on there when the original album didn't come out for another three years in October of 1992.<br />I don't plan on playing the records because from what I understand they are the originals and not re-mastered and since I already have the original Erotica album on vinyl, I currently don't see a need to play these.<br />I definitely recommend getting this as a gift to your Madonna fan.<br />I found my copy for $27 and currently Amazon is offering it at a hefty $50.

B007WV05GY|4.0|I can't remember a movie that Liam Neeson was in that I have not liked. The Grey is a dark emotional thought provoking survival drama. The writers could have and should have explored the father and son connection just a bit more and earlier in my humble opinion. This would have made that bond deeper creating more meaning and developed that premise \\"Once more into the fray, into the last good fight I'll ever know.\\" It works in the end though just a thought.<br />  Character building was minimal but it worked. The wolves were somewhat predictable but still scary. They had an air of CG (or lack of reality) that was touching the envelop of believability. I know it's a movie but it is supposed to draw you in and take you there, not kick you out every so often. This movie does hold you there. The weather does seem unbelievably cold and real. The thought of surviving that wreck, hiking through the snow, chased by wolves, whoa. The scene after the wreck and the man dying from a cut artery was profound, one of the best in the movie. I liked the banter back and fourth between the men. Shows reality and the hierarchy of that Pack. Yes these men were their own wolf pack Neeson being the Alpha male. Maybe too deep for an action flick but the ending proved to be uplifting in that \\"we are men that will go once more into that fray and perceiver\\" I liked that.

B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Wow, I am upgrading from my Intel Core Duo 2 rig and everything now is just faster, quicker and more responsive. I had to build a completely new PC, but it was worth it. I was able to overclock it fairly easily.<br /><br />I OCed it 4.5ghz with 1.175volts and so far has ran stable with idle temps in the 30 C and heavy load at 60 C. I was able to go to 5.0ghz with my aftermarket H&S, but the temps were getting in the 80 C so I stopped. Water cooling might be better for people who decide to go above 5.0ghz constantly.<br /><br />The bad thing is that the on-board GPU for this CPU is not working. Windows 7 does not detect it and the motherboard does not want to initialize it. My computer keeps on rebooting just before it hits the Windows 7 loading screen constantly whenever I enable the on-board GPU in my motherboard's BIOs.<br /><br />Bummer, I was was eager to try out the Lucid Virtu MVP technology to see if it could bring some new life into my aging NVidia GTX 260 card.<br /><br />Sent back the CPU to Amazon for a replacement. Will update my review when I get to try out all of the CPU's features.<br /><br />******Update 05/14/2012*******<br />My new motherboard was the cause of my problem not the CPU. Now everything runs fine with the replacement motherboard Amazon sent me. Wow! The Lucid Virtu MVP technology is nice it uses the Intel HD 4000 in conjuction with my old Nvidia GTX 260 kind of like SLI or Crossfire. I'm getting around 10-20% improvement in FPS with some of my games now. I might not need to buy a new graphic card after all as I have planned to.<br /><br />******Update 05/20/2012******<br />Meh, the Lucid Virtu MPV software seems to only work really well for a select few games. I don't seen any improves at all when playing games like Diablo 3 and Splinter Cell Conviction and in fact it lowers the FPS in those games. Lucid Virtue MVP seems like a good idea, but it needs more improvement. The only games where I was getting improvements were like Team Fortress 2, Guilds Wars and other really old, but still graphic intensive old games.ess 2, Guilds Wars and other really old, but still graphic intensive old games.

0446525537|5.0|This is the fifth book of Nicholas Sparks that I have read.  It started out slow, but from his other books that I have read and enjoyed, I knew it would be worth the wait.  It certainly was. Then one night when I was trying to find something to watch on TV I came across \\"A Walk to Remember\\".  I didn't know this book was made into a movie.  I only got to see the last 30 minutes, and how I wished I'd known about it, to watch from the beginning.  I hope Nicholas Sparks continues his writing of novels.

1250000971|4.0|As a fan of Jeffrey Archer's writings, I know that he can write a better book than this one, but this one is enjoyable, however light. Archer tells family drama well, especially when they involve generations of people. He makes sure that the various histories are full of enough soap opera to keep the reader reading. In this tale, the reading is short, so you will need two books for the beach, or even three for a long flight. But, The Sins of The Father will fill some of that time quite well. And you will be wondering when volume three will come out.<br />No free copy of the book was provided to me by the publisher or anyone associated with the book!

B002JVWQSW|4.0|Modern Family did not grab me when I first watched the pilot on TV, but after hearing such great critical reviews, I decided to go for it on DVD, especially since I like most of the cast members.  When I took the time to actually pay attention to every line, I found it quite funny. Now that I have come to know the characters, it gets funnier (although I can sometimes guess exactly what will be coming next.)<br />Funniest?  Best?  Probably not, but still up there close to the top.<br /><br />The only slight negatives:  After EVERY episode, I had to get through the screen that says, \\"The views expressed in the interviews and commentary...\\"  You know the one.  And then comes the warning about copyrighted material. Come on! We all know about all of that. If you need to put it in for legal reasons, ONCE is enough! Most DVDs put it at the beginning, and in some you can skip past it once you see it. Here you are bombarded after every episode. NOT necessary! (BTW, there were no commentaries anyway.)<br />Also I could not understand why Episode 6 was changed to Episode 2 on Disc 1.  I am a stickler for watching episodes in the order that they aired, but this was a bit of a mystery to me.  The only assumption I can make is that the episodes were on the DVD in the order they were filmed, although this is usually not the case for TV DVDs if that order is different from airing order. Fortunately, this show does not rely on what happened in previous episodes, at least not yet.<br /><br />Overall, I am now a fan of the series and hope not to miss an episode.
B004BLTNM0|5.0|This 1978 sexploitation flick written and directed by Meir Zarchi offered a strong commentary on feminism and sexuality. Starring Camille Keaton, the granddaughter of my personal hero Buster Keaton, as a young writer who rents a country cottage for a summer to have the solitude necessary to finally make her stab at writing the great American novel. Unfortunately, she runs into a small group of small town redneck degenerates, who quite brutally beat and repeatedly rape and torture her. Left alone to deal with the trauma, and without any resources or allies, she has no choice but to take matters into her own hands in a series of shocking acts of vengeance.<br /><br />While the prolonged brutality of the rape scenes are indeed hard to watch, knowing that this movie has always garnered demeaning attentions is almost as vulgar. This is a damn good film, regardless of the realism of its violence and psychological turmoil. Keaton is very beautiful in a plain, easily identifiable way, thereby getting extra sympathy from pre-programmed Western audiences. And her bravery in undertaking such a performance where she is naked and bloody for much of her screen time is a statement to her credibility as an actress and an artist. While the victimization is painstakingly real, as I have seen myself through my own activities in the cause of Domestic Violence Awareness, the inadvertent heroine's responses are sadly unreal, although hopefully have and will serve as inspiration to any victims of assault lacking empowerment.<br /><br />I understand there has been a more recent remake, but being a traditionalist I always prefer the originals. I Spit On Your Grave is a true cult classic, and when viewed in mixed company will lead directly to some interesting debates and commentary. This is what art should do.

B002Q4TKAY|1.0|Disappointed.  Really looked forward to receiving this album.  I agree with other reviews that it sounds like a bootleg copy - really muddled sound - microphone behind crowd.  My theater system is setup for live concerts and usually can over come the difficulties of live recordings but not this one.  Maybe I'll try the blu-ray to see if better quality.
B0002YJ29O|5.0|How often do we get to see our favorite concert pianists and violinists together in one place, playing wonderful music, interacting on a personal level, relaxed and having so much fun? This is a rare recording that one must have.<br /><br />The selections are so light and happy....appropriate for the birthday and anniversary celebration that it was made for. So many aspects of this extravaganza are reminiscent of my own happy experiences. The Jamaican Rhumba was a favorite of my mother and aunt who played this piece for 4 hands every time they had a chance to do so.<br /><br />Best of all, it gives us a tiny peak into the unique personalities of the participants...from motherly mentor Martha Argerich, reserved Mikhail Pletnev, young and exuberant LangLang, always seemingly jolly Emanuel Ax, to my all time favorite mildly aloof, no-nonsense Evgeny Kissin. I could go on and on but it's time for me to watch this DVD for the nth time.<br /><br />How I wish I was there....well having this DVD is the next best thing to being there.<br /><br />PS - This DVD is a perfect gift for music lovers. I have given away no less than 10 to my mother and her group at the Conservatory of Music, University of Santo Tomas. This group has been performing together (using 10 grand pianos) at the Cultural Center of the Philippines since the early '90s to raise funds for music scholars.

1935670913|5.0|I am still new to self publishing. John has open my eyes to marketing my book and how to use twitter and the social media to help. Thank you for your insights.
0345803493|1.0|If you, like myself, were not impressed with the first book and decided to go ahead and read the second one because surely it gets better: don't waste your time. It doesn't.<br /><br />The writing itself is painfully juvenile and repetitive. The narrator reminds me of a twelve year old rather than a twenty-one year old, which means it just gets awkward to read when there is a sex scene. There are certain phrases and such that are repeated an infuriating amount of times: \\"inner goddess,\\" \\"'Oh, Ana,'\\" \\"'Don't bite your lip, Ana,'\\" and so on and so forth. I wanted to hit something by the time I was 75% finished, and that's generally not a good reaction to have while reading a novel.<br /><br />The sex scenes do not redeem the book, either. Again, BDSM is grossly misrepresented. Spoiler alert: Being into BDSM is not the same as wanting to beat women that look like your neglectful mother. No wonder Ana is so hesitant - this isn't a normal BDSM relationship, this is creepy and Christian is most likely mentally ill and definitely a controlling, abusive boyfriend. And surprisingly, that doesn't turn me on, so the sex scenes were quite the flop.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this series. I enjoy a good, trashy novel, especially with a little BDSM thrown in. But I just couldn't get into it. It had quite a bit of potential too - I would have loved to see Christian be dominant without the excuse of childhood abuse, and have Ana come to terms with that. And I would have loved to see Ana be more open to exploring her sexuality, rather than second-guessing herself at every turn and regarding Christian as a sad product of abuse. Unfortunately, however, nobody asked me, and the result is a bland, pointless, and very unsexy book.
0345803485|1.0|I don't know what depresses me more... this pathetically written cliche of a book or its popularity.  How?  Why?  Who?  Now that would be a book worth reading.... how this piece of trash out of all the literature in the world (including some erotica) became so popular.  Maybe Malcomb Gladwell could shed some light.  You know the idiot at the bar that tells you they could have written something just as good... well in this case its true.
1455508977|2.0|I've always wanted to read Sparks but never got around to it until now. Boy, I hope the rest aren't like this. I found the story to be boring and predictable. The dialogue was terrible. I felt like the characters were underdeveloped...especially Beth, who was down right annoying with her self pity and lonely girl angst. And Keith? I'm not sure where Sparks conjured up that doozy of a vilian but his thought process was completely unbelievable. And the fact that Beth was oblivious to Keith's true self made the story that more shallow. Despite everything I just said, it's a book to pass the time. If it weren't for Nana and her ambiguous metaphors I probably would've put the book right down. So if you like wise old people and an okay story to get you through the day, this book is for you. If you like characters with girth and a clear voice, skip it.
B005HSG3VK|4.0|I dropped my kindle fire, and this case kept it from breaking, so I'm not going to.complain too much. I also like that the cover folds back around and the elastic holds it in place.

All in all though, if you don't plan on using the stand much, it is well worth the money.

B007HO392S|4.0|I have to be honest.  When I first listened to this album all the way through, just one week ago, I was feeling a little underwhelmed.  Carrie's first three records were so dead on.  I was not sure that her fourth album Blown Away was up to par.  But the more I listened to it on my car stereo, the more it started to grow on me.  I started to pay more attention to the lyrics and began to recite the melodies. Then, I slowly found myself reciting many of the tracks long after I had reached my destination.<br /><br />\\"Two Black Cadillacs\\" was one that, once I really listen, it really caught my attention.  Originally thinking that the song was about cars, I quickly learned that its meaning was far from that.  Certainly the darkest song on her album, this song has the potential to be a single, that is if the world is ready for such a dark song from america's sweetheart.<br /><br />Another favorite is \\"Good in Goodbye\\".  A staple Carrie ballade, this track describes the bittersweet nature of seeing an old love again but realizing that sometimes leaving that person behind is for the better.  This also has single potential.<br /><br />The moral of this story is, once you have listened to the album all the way through, listen to it again.  You will soon find yourself liking it, then loving it.  Besides her current hit, \\"Good Girl\\", you will find yourself singing along to other uptempo hits like \\"Do You Think Of Me\\", \\"Nobody Ever Told You\\" and `Leave Love Alone\\".  You will also find yourself relating to dramatic ballads like \\"Thank God for Hometowns\\" and Wine After Whiskey\\".<br /><br />I guess Carrie was right when asked on Good Morning America last week what to expect on this album, when she jokingly replied, \\"14 tracks of awesome\\"!<br /><br />-Jenny Thorpe<br />  Source: [...]
B0041KKYBA|4.0|First, I would opine that the movie was well done.  However, one must always consider the source.  It is my understanding that the director of Inside Job, Mr Ferguson, along with a partner, founded a \\"dot com\\" company back in the 90s and after a couple of years sold it for over $100 million.  So Mr Ferguson, a product of SF and UC Berkeley, is an extremely wealthy left winger.  So he's on \\"easy street\\" with a bundle of cash.  Enough I guess.  That's OK but it should be known to all.  Capitalism has done well by Mr Ferguson.  I guess things have gone wrong since we \\"merged\\" normal banking with investment banking.  It does seem that Wall St runs the show at DC.  (Way too much money coming from the financial lobby groups.)  I was saddened to learn that many of our economists and leaders at our better business schools are in the middle of the mess.  They're getting their \\"consulting\\" money.  They're getting their share for doing nothing more than supporting (lending their names) to a corrupt system.  George Soros a \\"good guy?\\"  Are you kidding me?  He is the definition of corruption, avarice and all that is wrong in the business world.  I'm a 53%er, I pay my taxes and I get by.  I don't beg, borrow or steal from anyone.  On one side of me I see the corrupt bankers and on the other side a bunch of spoiled and useless 20 and 30 yr olds screaming for handouts (the \\"cccupy crowd\\" who want their debt forgiven - all losers).  I'm a farmer (183 acres) and it is rewarding to do something useful.  In the words of Jack Nicholson in Easy Rider, \\"this used to be a heck of a good country.\\"  Not so much anymore.  Teach your children well.  Encourage them to go into engineering, medicine, education.  We don't need any more investment bankers, lawyers or politicians.  I was born in the mid 1950s and I keep telling everyone things were really better in America back in the good ol days.  Keep the faith.

1609419693|4.0|Bossypants is memoir which brings out the light, witty and classic Tina Fey that we all know from SNL. The beginning of the book was slow where much of it was filled with random stories of her growing up. Learning about Fey's beginnings before Saturday Night Live (SNL) was truly inspiring. Later part of the book was all about great Saturday Night Live insights into the workings of the team over many years and the creation/success of 30 Rock.<br /><br />Pros:<br />o good use of humor to tell stories<br />o interesting behind the scenes look at the comedy industry<br /><br />Cons:<br />o a bit disjointed in sections<br /><br />Overall - Recommended book for a day trip where you can laugh with the whole family.
B005LAIHIQ|3.0|Dark Shadows (2012). Rated PG-13. Running Time: One hour, 53 mins.<br />Directed by Tim Burton.<br /><br />***June 27, 2016 marks the 50th Anniversary of &#34;Dark Shadows&#34;.<br /><br />The House of Dark Shadows is Alive. Woof!<br />I appreciate Tim Burton and Johnny Depp revitalizing Dark Shadows again for those of us middle-aged and seniors who enjoyed the original Dark Shadows soap opera (1966-71) in our younger days. Perhaps this movie will open some new doors and obtain new fans.<br /> Dark Shadows (1966-71) is still more popular than ever. The DVD Collections are selling like hot cakes.<br />  After seeing Sleepy Hollow (1991) and Alice in Wonderland (2010), I then got the idea of what Tim Burton and Johnny Depp might do with Dark Shadows (2012).  It was very different and tried to be more of a comedy to honor the 1970's and the Dark Shadows story.<br />  The movie opens giving us a brief history of the Collins family and how this town of Collinsport was built up by the Collins Family. Now it's 1972 and Victoria Winters (Bella Heathcote) is at first taking a train ride and then having to hitch a ride to the Collinwood Estate. The song &#34;Nights in White Satin&#34; by Moody Blues, is played to help us get in the mood.<br />  A chained coffin is excavated deep underground from where one of Angelique's building projects will be constructed. A workman breaks the chains from around the coffin and the strong power of Barnabas Collins is unleashed. Everyone is killed at the construction site. Barnabas (Johnny Depp) has been locked away for 195 years and has an incredible thirst for human blood. You see he is a vampire. For the first time, Barnabas sees a McDonald's Restaurant and a paved road with an automobile. He makes his way back to the Collinwood Estate.<br /><br /> This movie includes the cameo appearance of four original cast members of  Dark Shadows (ABC, 1966-71). Jonathan Frid (&#34;Barnabas Collins&#34;), Kathryn Leigh Scott (&#34;Maggie&#34;), Lara Parker (&#34;Angelique&#34;) and David Selby (&#34;Quentin&#34;).<br /><br /> My eyes were focused on Jonathan Frid and Kathryn Leigh Scott and although they were together, Lara Parker and David Selby went by too fast for me to see clearly. They should have let them stop and all say a few lines so they could be seen real good on film.<br /><br /> How interesting to note that Jonathan Frid became popular with his first appearance as &#34;Barnabas Collins&#34; in Dark Shadows in 1967 and his final role was in this &#34;Dark Shadows&#34; movie. He made his exit stage left. He passed away April 14, 2012 at the age of 87...27 days before this film's release.<br /><br /> Christopher Lee also has a small role whom was known in his prime as Dracula, Prince of Darkness. [[ASIN:B0000W5H7E Dracula Prince of Darkness/The Satanic Rites of Dracula]].<br /><br /> Alice Cooper sings a couple songs from his heyday in the 1970's.<br /><br /> Everyone has their own opinion of how a new Dark Shadows movie could be. I would like to add my 2 cents worth.<br />  I don't think it was necessary for Johnny Depp to wear the white make-up at all. He could have played &#34;Barnabas&#34; with his own natural face and skin tone and it would have worked.<br /><br /> I didn't care for Jackie Earle Haley as &#34;Willie&#34; and thought it would have been great if the original &#34;Willie&#34; from the tv series could have played &#34;Willie&#34; again. Karlen did played &#34;Willie&#34; again in [[ASIN:B0012DP6L2 House of Dark Shadows]] (1970) and &#34;Alex Jenkins&#34; in [[ASIN:B002SP75TE Night Of Dark Shadows]] (1971).<br /><br />Eva Green you know as &#34;Vesper Lynd&#34; in [[ASIN:B00946WM6Q Casino Royale [HD]]] (2006) and now the Penny Dreadful tv series (Showtime, 2014-present)<br /><br /> They made &#34;Carolyn&#34; a girl of 15 years old in this version. I thought Chloe Grace Moretz did a wonderful job and I think we will be seeing much more of her as an actress in her adult years to come.<br /><br /> I wanted so much to hear Michelle Pfeiffer say &#34;Meow&#34; in this film, but not even close.<br /><br /> Jonny Lee Miller is the grandson of Bernard Lee who played &#34;M&#34; in the James Bond movies in 1962-1979. Jonny is now on Elementary (CBS, 2012-present) as a modern-day &#34;Sherlock Holmes&#34;.<br /><br /> Dark Shadows was broadcast on the ABC Network before or after &#34;General Hospital&#34; in your area.

0439023521|5.0|Savanna Fleeman<br />Mr. Ruple<br />Literacy 8R<br />11, May 2012<br /><br />In the book The Hunger Games, the  main characters are Katniss Everdeen, Peeta Malark, Gale, Prim Rose, and the people in the actual Hunger Games. The setting is basically in the forest while those characters are playing the game, and fighting to win.<br />Basically, the main conflict is don't die. They have to fight other people from other districts to not die. If they don't die then that person wins the hunger games. Peeta and Katniss are the two people who get picked from there District.<br /><br />The characters are shy at first. Peeta and Katniss don't talk a lot because they don't really know each other. Peeta is in love with Katniss and she doesn't find out till later in the novel. I would say that the characters in this novel are likable because they are nice to other people and kind. But some characters aren't very nice to Katniss in the games. They all group up and try to kill her.  One theme in this novel is Building relationships and having trust in your friends.<br /><br />I think all ages and everyone will enjoy this novel. I liked it and it is one of my favorite books. Also I think any gender will like it who likes love, action, and thriller. It is a great book to read.

I use it for homework and for the occasional random word I know but do not always know the exact meaning of the word. It can improve vocabulary and then you sound smarter. I highly recommend it! :)
B007SGM084|5.0|I heard about the books through a coworker. So I took a chance and began reading. Shades of grey, takes the reader to a deep dark place that is widely considered taboo. There your swept into a place that is intriguing and mysterious. The characters, Christian and Anastasia are captivating. From the first page of the first book to the last page of the final book, I was held captive. Lost in the world E L James created. I give this trilogy 5stars. The best I've ever read.
B007HO392S|5.0|I am so impressed with how far Carrie has come since American Idol. She is now a fierce, courageous, creative songwriter who is willing to tackle all sorts of controversial issues such as domestic violence,revenge, death, love lost and regretted, etc.<br />Blown Away is the best album of her career, as she has really blossomed as both a songwriter and even as a vocalist. I did not think she could possibly improve on her voice from her previous albums, but she did on this one. Perhaps it is the softer more organic production on certain songs like Wine After Whiskey or Do you Think About Me, but her voice really shines on this album.<br /><br />What I love is that it starts out strong and edgy with Good Girl, but then Carrie shows her more vulnerable side in sweet songs like Do You Think About Me, Wine After Whiskey, Good in Goodbye, Forever Changed, etc. But then it kicks up again in tempo and you get a real barn burner in Cupid's Got a Shotgun and Leave Love Alone. :)<br /><br />See You Again is breathtaking. I know she wrote it for a movie, but it fits very nicely on this album. Her vocals just soar on this song and the hook is very catchy.<br /><br />Blown Away is like a rocket: the story is obviously extremley compelling. It grabs your attention and just consumes you through the dramatic story. I love the hook and the melody is very catchy, plus the production is really intense, but it works on this song. Love it!<br /><br />One Way Ticket is a great catchy summer song-- and I am thrilled that Carrie dared to go reggae and light on this one. It is a different sound for her, but it works. Expect this song to rocket up the charts next summer.<br /><br />Overall, I feel like this is the album I have been waiting for from Carrie. It is a fun, bumpy, but beautiful journey, and when the cd is over, you are left satisfied....though of course wanting more anyway. lol<br /><br />DOWNLOAD:  Cupid's Gotta Shotgun, Wine After Whiskey, One Way Ticket, Blown AWay, See You Again<br /><br />ok-- just buy the whole dang thing. lol

B006HGXGWU|5.0|Written and directed by Jeff Nichols, TAKE SHELTER is a movie about a man who has terrifying visions who actually might be a prophet, but whom no one believes because modern science says it can't be so.  The film stars Michael Shannon as Curtis. Curtis has a high-paying job that includes excellent health benefits. He's married to his beautiful wife Samantha (Jessica Chastain). They have one child, a daughter named Hannah, who is deaf. Thanks to the health insurance through Curtis' job, Hannah is eligible for a cochlear implant to restore part of her hearing. At the beginning of the film, Curtis' best friend and co-worker, Dewart (Shea Whigham) tells Curtis something to the effect that he's got a great life.<br /><br />Then Curtis starts having nightmares. In some ways the dreams are more vivid than anything he has experienced in real life. In the dreams, he sees a storm of Apocalyptical proportions occur. People go crazy and someone is always chasing either him or his family. The dreams become more and more intense. So much so, that Curtis begins fixing up the old storm shelter in the backyard. As he does so, the dreams begin happening while he is awake and at work: he begins seeing flocks of birds and massive bolts of lightning that no one else can see, he feels drops of rain and gusts of wind that no one else can feel, and he hears the screams of his daughter as she's taken away by people who don't even exist. Curtis' mother is a schizophrenic and he fears that he might be suffering from the same disease. Is Curtis mentally unstable or is he a modern-day prophet?<br /><br />TAKE SHELTER is an incredibly well-written film that has some amazing acting. Michael Shannon wasn't even nominated for an Academy Award, but he should have been (as an actor, he puts both George Clooney and Brad Pitt to shame). Jessica Chastain gives off another great performances that were actually typical for her in 2011. All of the other supporting actors do a fine job, too.<br /><br />The movie is a character-driven, slow-roasting drama that isn't for everyone. There's minimal dialogue and very little action. But a movie like TAKE SHELTER shouldn't have gobs of dialogue and lots of action.<br /><br />TAKE SHELTER is highly recommended. It's one of the best movies that was released in 2011 and is an overlooked gem.movie is a character-driven, slow-roasting drama that isn't for everyone.

B000QCS8TW|5.0|Honestly, this is the best fantasy story out there. Great writing, and as in other reviews the realism makes it all the more better. I bow to GRRM, being fearless with killing major characters. In my opinion, thats the most risky thing an author can do. Yet somehow he makes it great. His writing style is magnificent. Even in the boring parts, GRRM still makes you sit at the edge of your seat, dying to know what's going to happens next. GRRM is a magnificent writer, with the rare ablility to make you think you know exactly what's going on, but when you least expect it twists the story into a completely different direction. To anyone who's wondering if they should read this series: pick it up, start reading, and it will be the best books you'll ever read. Do yourself a a favor and read A Game of Thrones.

B005ARYEY6|4.0|In 1967 Miles Davis took his 5 man band to northern Europe to play a series of gigs. This particular collaboration included a 20 year old Tony Williams on drums, Ron Carter on bass, Wayne Shorter on Sax and Herbie Hancock on piano. As a group they were together from 1964 to 1968 which must have been a longevity record for Davis. This particular set includes 3 CD's and a DVD which runs about 70 minutes. This is actually 2 separate events. Both were recorded for television in front of a shiny white audience in a smallish auditorium with nothing flashy. Just 5 great jazz musicians on a plain stage in front of plain curtains. The first set (tracks 1-5) was filmed at the Stadthalle in Karlsruhe, Germany on Nov. 7, 1967. The second set (tracks 6-10) came from the Konserthuset in Stockholm, Sweden.<br /><br />Unfortunately of the 10 tracks recorded, 4 are the same. Sure the arrangements and the performances may differ slightly but...come on. The German set includes \\"I Fall In Love Too Easily\\" and is replaced in the Swedish show with \\"Round Midnight.\\" The video is very grainy but for TV is easily watchable. The audio is a lossless PCM mono and sounds excellent. This particular video has only been released previously in 2009 as part of a 70 CD Miles Davis package called \\"The Complete Columbia Album Collection.\\" Worthy Miles, et. al.<br /><br />While I appreciate Miles Davis as much as the next guy, this collection is a bit of a rip-off. It had been in my Amazon holding queue for months and when the price finally came down to the low $30 range, I bit. Here's the deal with the 3 CD's. There are numerous replications. Sure, I understand that each set may have differences, especially with this genre, but still. There are 24 songs on 3 discs. Only 3 are unique in that they are not duplicated on one of the other CD's. And 2 of those can also be found on the accompanying DVD. The music itself sounds great but this should have been culled down to one or two discs. Better yet, take the best cuts and put them on Blu ray along with a cleaner copy of the video.he best cuts and put them on Blu ray along with a cleaner copy of the video.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I love me a good romance novel with some good steamy sex in it. I got so excited about the fact that this book was getting so much buzz, so despite the reviews here I still bought it. YIKES, bad choice. These other reviews weren't kidding when they said that it was just line after line of cliches! Additionally, I thought the heroine (if we can call her that) was just annoying and terribly naive.  While I was reading I kept thinking about how much it reminded me of fan fiction.... and surprise surprise this story was originally written with Bella & Edward as the leading cast. All in all, take these reviews to heart! There are much better books to read that are just as steamy....without the awful, juvenile dialogue (and endless email conversations! JEEZ.)
