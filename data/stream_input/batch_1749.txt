B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is one of the best TV series, not just Sci-Fi series, I've ever seen.  Its well written, entertaining and so full of wit that you've got to watch it at least twice to catch everything.  Cancelling this series was a horrible decision that proves TV networks are not to be trusted with shows of this quality...  If you're a fan of space, westerns, Joss Whedon, Nathan Fillion or just like good TV that is well written, buy this!
B00846REIS|3.0|This book overall has pretty decent ratings and, although I had read that it was similar to Fifty Shades, I wasn't expecting that to be so blatantly obvious.  If you've read Fifty Shades, there is no way that you won't recognize things that appear to have been copied, and Fifty Shades is better.  I'm a bit disappointed.  I hate starting a book and not finishing it; and I hate starting a series and not reading all of the books.  However, I'm not sure I will purchase the 2nd book in the series.  Maybe I will try the sample and decide from there.

B001TCHDPS|5.0|Sixto Rodriguez is fabulous as always.  Every song has such meaning in  life.<br />Need to hear more of him, more concerts in America.  Wish he would hit the Talk Show circuit.<br />&#34;It Started Out So Nice&#34; is a wonderful heartfelt song.
B007N8RULO|1.0|After playing this a few times it no longer worked. I tried deleting it and downloading it again 3 times.  All I get is a blank screen. I never even got as far as other people who saw all the ads.  There are better choices. (Spider solitaire gasp is better).
B000V7J82S|5.0|Wow this album was even better than I expected. Not only is it a great journey but the sound is amazing. You definitely hear a much richer sound from this album, a very worthy addition to anyones collection.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|enjoy the music, love the album and the singer, would love to see more of this type of music, excellent
B001993Y2C|5.0|This is like Alien II combined with Blade runner, and a bit of Start Treck Enterprise. My top movies.<br />They must have hired their producers. I am only at the 2nd cd and I am already hooked.<br />Rumors says they stop the series because it was to expensive to produce. It kind of shows !<br />Wow !

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book was a wonderful read that I would recommend to all readers. It's gripping and hilarious characters, twists, and plot hook the reader from the start. Anyone with a knowledge of 80's culture or with a gaming fascination will enjoy this read. -MTFBWY
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I loved this book this had to be my favorite book in the series! It was very good and I didn't wanna stop reading it because it was so good. It might be short but its really good! I suggest this book to people who love this series and yea... well ok there's my opinion!

B009CGYO0K|5.0|Super.  Just loved it.  The drawings are not too cutesy and the observations of cat behaviour are spot on.  Cats are beautiful and cats are mean - that's what one gets
B0001I561E|2.0|DVD took a while to ship which I expected but it was described as being in better condition than it actually is. I cannot play the dvd all the way through because there are major scratches and the movie either skips into the next chapter or just stops all together, really annoyed.

B006BAEQB2|5.0|Philippa Gregory is one of my favorite authors.  She writes about the people I have always been interested in along with the historical venues I love.  I have all of her books and highly recommend them to others who love history, too.
0374275637|5.0|What a great read - this book will challenge your thoughts around how much decision and thought freedom you actually possess. Don't be fooled - this is not an easy light read, no one-year bestseller, no fastfood for the brain. An experienced reader will find lots of joy on the journey with Kahneman, an unexperienced one will possibly have to put the book away after some 20 pages. For something easier to read in this realm, grab 'What makes your brain happy and why you should do the opposite'.<br /><br />If you are ready for a more sophisticated writing style though, this book will guide you into the depths on the decision-making and bias forming mechanisms, and will raise your alertness with respect to how you ended up with one or another view or idea. A must-read for quering minds, deserving a proud slot on the bookshelf.
1451695195|1.0|This book might be a trick from the devil, be careful. First off this book never mentions Jesus Christ. The Bible states that Jesus Christ is the only way to heaven. Next, the author changes God's name to \\"Ohm\\" or \\"Om\\", I already forgot. This is blasphemy. God's name is God or Yahwey. After realizing this about 1/3 of the way into book, I just skimmed the rest. Towards the end of the book he confirms a statement about the big bang theory. What? He believes in the big bang theory. True Christians believe that God created the world, not some stupid big bang theory. This is when I realized that this book is not from God, but some kind of trick.<br /><br />If you want to read a real book on the afterlife, go get \\"Flight to Heaven\\" by Dale Black. Now that is a book that confirms that Jesus Christ is the way, the truth, and the life. This book will bring a tear to your eye and is a 5/5 rating. Don't waste your money or your mind on \\"Proof of Heaven\\".

B0053KWDES|5.0|I'm powering these to my Audio-Technica ATHM50's.  I use them for just about everything: music, TV shows, movies, even on my home stereo system.<br />I like the added options of +3/+6 db gains and the options of eq 0/1/2.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Very simple to use<br />Small, lightweight<br />No distortion<br />So far so good battery, over 5+ hours of constant play (haven't tested the claimed 10 hours yet)<br /><br />Cons:<br />haven't been totally blown away with the enhanced sound<br /><br />I also tested these on some cheap headphones I've owned for several years now.  There is a bigger difference with these headphones (roughly $15 when I bought them) compared to my ATHM50s.
B004EPZ07U|4.0|i think this film was good but i believe the wrong actor was chosen for it as it did derive from a comic so it may have been more suitable for a Saturday night live actor... saying that the CGI was great and the action sequences were good but the final battle was not long enough and the love story left a little to be desired.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|The DVD arrived early and was in the condition promised. I had seen the movie before, but I really loved the story line of the movie.

B003VANOFY|5.0|This headset is ridiculously well made. Fits well, even on big heads, comfortably. Good volume, flexes well. 7.1 CH sounds great, especially in game, and with a 12 hour battery life, who is complaining?<br /><br />The only con is you HAVE TO HAVE TO HAVE TO update the software on the website, if you can call that a con. The software on the CD is nonsense and makes the sidetone not work.<br /><br />Great buy for the price.
B001HN690O|5.0|i ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT JACK BLACK DID REALLY WELL AND THE ACTION AND HUMOUR WAS REFRESHING MY WHOLE FAMILY LOVED IT AND THE YOUNGSTERS CANT GET ENOUGH....WHAT A GREAT HEART FELT STORY.<br /><br />HOW CAN ANYONE NOT LIKE THIS FILM.
B009B2VBWE|3.0|I was not particularly impressed with the listening sample, and therefore avoided buying it on street date. But, being a HUGE Diana Krall FAN, I found the $3.99 Black Friday price irresistible. Definitely worth the price. The \\"Sultry Vocals\\" are still there. Missing, or relegated to the Back Seat, is the Jazzy, Driving, Band Leader Piano, that I LOVE. Instead, it has been replaced by a Jug Band Sound that the Lovin Spoonful Doctor says, \\"Seems to Make Them Feel Just Fine.\\"
B0088TG252|4.0|i didnt expect this to be anything super, but surprisingly the movie was really good. pretty nice story, nice action...
B000B8L6LI|5.0|This system was better than expected. Once you get the hang of it it sharpens razor sharp. good buy for most outdoorsman
B008CP93S0|5.0|i havent heard anything about this movie, decided to watch it and glad that i did. very funny, excellent story. definitely worth renting and watching if you want to have a good laugh...<br /><br />also check out HORRIBLE BOSSES similar cast and the funniest movie i seen in a while.
B000KJZWMW|5.0|I love Mad Max movies.  All of them.  And all of them for a very same reason:  they are all simple and all extremely effective.  To the point that you just don't ask questions, instead immersed in the storytelling.  Everything in the movie seems to work because it's so direct, it's so unpretentious.  Love it.
B0000AQS6R|5.0|I bought the BluRay version & watched it this past Christmas, it works perfectly! I can finally watch this without missing parts & getting frustrated by it skipping.<br /><br />Overall: Awesome! Very fair price, I highly recommend the BluRay version.<br /><br />*IMPORTANT: My low rating (initially 1/5) had NOTHING to do with the movie/storyline itself, but was strictly based on the actual DVD.<br />I bought the Special Edition (2003) DVD several years ago for my mom as a pre-Christmas present; it's one of our all-time favorites to watch around the holidays. Unfortunately, the movie cut out in 2 different places, the first cut is when Clark plugs in the house lights (hilarious!) & the second was near the end, it skipped so far that it jumped to the end credits, we missed a good 5-10 minutes. My family is careful when handling DVDs, so no, this isn't related to scratches or fingerprints; in saying that, I still tried cleaning the DVD anyways with no success.
B001LM1456|4.0|I think Hulk is awesome, I just really dig the desperation.  And the thing I like about this movie is Edward Norton.  But also he's pretty much the only great thing about the movie.  It's not a boring and bad movie, it's just that it's not as satisfying (story-wise) as the first one with Eric Bana, who I think was just a wrong actor.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It seems like apocalyptic fiction is all the rage lately.  I'm growing a bit tired of the genre and yet I really enjoyed Wool 1-5.  Mr. Howey's characters are believable and compelling, and the story kept me interested.  The challenge for any writer of fiction is to invoke a willing suspension of disbelief by the reader, and that's a particularly difficult task in sci-fi.  I am mechanically inclined with a decent tech and science background, so it's unlikely any sci-fi book will completely convince me.  However, to use a corny pun, Mr. Howey successfully pulled the \\"Wool\\" over my eyes for all but one or two scenes in his story.  There is plenty left unexplained by the end of the fifth book, but this just leaves room for many more tales in the Wool universe.  This story is sufficiently engaging that I want to find out more. At the age of 50, this is becoming a rarity for me as more and more stories fail to capture my interest; been there, done that.  When I find something that keeps my interest, that's a real treasure.<br /><br />Mr. Howey claims that he reads every review on Amazon, so I will take this opportunity to say, \\"Well done,\\" and encourage him to keep up the good work.  I'm looking forward to more from this author.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|The title of this review is misleading.  What I meant to say was that it could be the best first half of the movie ever made.  While the second half is merely good, the first half is absolutely brilliant, incredible, wonderful!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its ok if you are bored. some of the mini games can be entertaining. my son likes to play this on my kindle.
0061673730|4.0|My friend picked this book up thinking its about motorcycle maintenance.  I bet the most folks know by now that it's not.  At all.  It's an interesting book to read, there are a lot of engaging philosophical discussions in the book, although I have to admit that in some places it's incredibly painful (or boring) to read.  I did enormously enjoyed and liked the discussion of the nature of quality.  If I ever teach again, I will make parts of the book a required reading.
B0083GVG6K|5.0|this show has it all, comedy , heartbreak , romance . TALENT BEYOND COMPARE! Can't wait for season two I cant imagine it getting better, but i know it does
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|Yeah, it's fun.  Robert Downey Jr. is totally awesome as Tony Stark, as always.  Is it just me, that preceding movies (Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Incredible Hulk) are more enjoyable?  The whole isn't quite more than sum of its parts?  Fun, yes, and it will effectively entertain and kill about 2 hours of your life.  Mission accomplished, I guess.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|liv it soooooooooooo much!!!!!!!!!!!this is the best one so far. this was a great app and people should get it. worth the price
B00271DNP4|5.0|The third film of the series, I think is the best of all.  It's menacingly dark and awesomely involving.  While other movies of the series feel a bit like made with kids in mind, this one feels like it was just made to be a good movie.  And maybe because of it, the film's departure from the book doesn't bother me at all.  I feel like it's the only one of the series that can stand apart from the book and hold its head up against it.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I like the game and it's fun to play, but there are too many adds! I could be able to find a Draw Something with no adds but the game isn't that good that I would want to spend money on it! But over all the game is good.
0805062971|5.0|Simply one of the most, and probably more than most important books ever written in and of my generation.  Should be a required reading.<br />Don't meant to be a killjoy, but the movie has a better ending.  But the casts were wrong.  Edward Norton should have played Tyler, while Brad Pitt would have been perfect as \\"jack\\".
B005G4TJI4|5.0|this is a must have for the rest of these movies you will not go wrong to buy it I loved it.
1451695195|5.0|I loved this book.  Although there was a lot of medical terminology, Dr. A did an amazing job at explaining it so the layperson such as myself could understand.  This detailed medical information was necessary to drive home the severity of his illness and the miracle that he survived with no brain damage.  I am so intrigued by NDE's and this book was so comforting and reassuring about the afterlife.  I wish Dr. A the best at getting his message across.  Best wishes!!!!
B001HZK8FO|5.0|it is one of the best movies ever that I have seen a wonderful love story a must watch movie for all.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Hey, it is what it is.  Not bad.  Not great.  Priced right, though.  Give it a shot, why not?  It won't kill you.
B004K4IZ54|5.0|better than the first one hands down buy it and in 3d a must have,I thought they did a great job.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I just downloaded this game today. it is just like the game at the casino. the only thing I don't like is if I'm not playing it takes 6 minutes to get more coins. if I am its 30 seconds. otherwise its a good game to pass the time.
B002JM1VJG|5.0|Madonna has put together quite a good list of hits and all on dvd I love this set A must have A++++++
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Great game except the fact the energy level deplete very fast, but other then that can't get enough. I thinks its better than the original Oregon Trail.
B003IPC5SO|5.0|If you don't have this CD it is a must have My son told me to get it and I don't regret it at all.
B0086700CM|4.0|It is a great game, but a few glitches. I have it on my kindle fire. You can not get coins unless you own an android, which was a bummer. Sometimes it is also a little slow. But I can not complain because it is free. And besides the glitches it is super fun and addicting. I would definitely download it. You will be sorry if you don't!
B0055EAJ7A|5.0|well it is the mighty Thor it was awesome i think that the 3d is good they picked the right man.
B000FC1MM8|5.0|This is my favorite In the Harry Bosch series; at least until he begins working in the Cold Case unit in later novels.
B001BVRNPW|5.0|This is the best one of the Star Gate movies,its ties it all together well and left no loose ends,I was so sad to see it end,A must have.
0452289963|4.0|I believe everyone knows somewhere deep down what their life's purpose truly is.  This book helps you dig down and find it.

B004D0YB4Y|4.0|Having heard it playing in a restaurant and then enquired about the album and artist decided I had to get it.
B0086449YA|5.0|I ordered the CD for my husband who was going to see Mark Knopfler in concert and wanted his latest cd.  I found myself enjoying it as much as he did.  Excellent !
B005J2UM9S|4.0|I thought this was pretty well done. It starts off tongue-and-cheek and a bit over-the-top, true, but it's on purpose. Once they go to what they think will be yet another letdown, things start picking up and escalating quickly. Imagine \\"1408\\" without the personal background and the happy ending. This was freaky and worth watching!
0792844890|5.0|Classic comedy movie,I enjoyed watching it again. By ordering this movie online it was a convenient way to find it.
B005KGPC4S|2.0|I am definitely a Kevin Smith fan. That said, this was only so-so. Not horrible by any stretch, and entertaining for the time alotted, but that's it. It doesn't do anything new, and is pretty much a self-indulgent romp through stereotypes with a few troubled navel-gazers thrown in to make it less monochromatic. There are some great performances by Parks and Goodman, and it's pretty well done, but the story is nothing special at all.
B0041KVW2K|1.0|I have now bought and returned three entire box sets.  The vinyl used for this release is inferior, and most of the albums have serious issues with noise, pops, crackles, etc, especially Abbey Road.  All three copies of Abbey Road I received were awful.  The noise and hiss was so loud on this album it's ridiculous.  And I have tried three different, brand new copies!<br /><br />There are also other problems.  Warping, off center labels or spindle holes, etc.<br /><br />The box itself is wonderful.  The artwork, the inserts and especially the book, are all well done, but if you can't even play the albums what's the point?<br /><br />Extremely frustrating and disappointing!!!
B009E3EY38|5.0|Thanks to all who were responsible for getting this concert out for the world to see and experience.  Even if you were there, can't imagine that you wouldn't want to see it again, and again.  One must accept this is it, and not pine for more. Enjoy and share with those who were not as fortunate to be around and experience Zeppelin in the day.  Don't waste time debating, just celebrate and re-live those moments from then and now.  Rejoice with \\"what is and what should never be,\\" and will never be again.  Thank you Jimmy, John (Bonzo), John Paul, Robert, and Jason.
B0034G4P80|4.0|I'm a relative newcomer to Marvel movies, and the comic book media genre in general. I've always heard of all the different superheroes, both DC and Marvel, but none of them ever really appealed to me. When I was younger I would watch the old Superman cartoons from the 40s. They were okay, now they seem rather cheesy. I've still never read an actual comic book. I'm nowhere near being an expert on comic book lore, though Marvel Wiki and DC Universe Wiki have helped a lot. I just enjoy a good action movie. And that is exactly what Marvel Studios has done with their various outings based on different members of the Avengers team. I saw Captain America in the theater, mostly because my cousin thought it was great, and she took me to go see it. I fell in love. Then the Avengers came out. There was a ton of hype surrounding it, but I never saw it. Never really had the time, to be honest. Now that it's out on DVD I think I'll pick it up. But let's get to the point. In our home, my dad previews movies before he lets the rest of the family watch them. He finally got around to Thor when it showed up for free on Amazon Instant video. He said it was okay, so we watched it.<br /><br />I would love to call Thor a 5 star epic with no flaws, as I can say about Captain America. but simply put, there are some flaws. For one, the story has too many loose ends. I felt like the writers tried to go into too many different aspects of Thor's character and existence, and in the end they stretched themselves too thin, and basically ran out of time. I think what upset me the most was that they didn't go into the relationship of Jane and Thor enough. It was like, you never really knew what was going on between them until she randomly kisses him at the end. I felt like they spent way too much time with the drama in Asgard. They could have left out a lot of the scenes with Thor's crew of warriors, because they didn't add a whole lot to the story anyway. They could have shortened the first battle scene with the Frost Giants and the crew. I thought that they did an outstanding job on Loki, and it was interesting to watch because you never knew if he had good intentions or bad intentions, and you sort of felt sorry for him because I think he didn't even know whether he had good intentions or bad intentions. The action sequences were good, but I always felt like Thor was too good for everyone else and he was just kind of toying with them. Maybe that's how it is in the comics, but to me in this movie he seemed way too god-like. I realize he is a god, but they could have made some of the stuff a little more challenging for him. I also thought what was supposed to be the big final battle with the giant metal robot guy was a little lame. He comes in, destroys the town, kills a couple people, then Thor beats the snot out of him. I thought it was hard to understand exactly why certain things happened. Like, why was Thor exiled in the first place? Why did he go back to Asgard when the girl he loved couldn't go? Why didn't he take her with him? Why did he destroy the bridge? Why didn't he just go back to Earth when he was through with Loki? I just felt like a lot of this stuff could have been tightened up and explained better. I thought that the comedy relief aspect was dead on. This movie was a lot funnier than Captain America. I really liked how they portrayed his dealing with a different and totally foreign culture. However, I do think that they could have spent more time on how he adapted to earth and its's oddness.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good movie, and one that's worth watching, especially if you want to get a ton of backstory for the Avengers. There are precious few areas where it really shines, and in every other way it's just good enough to get by, with no terrible atrocities. Recommended.scene with the Frost Giants and the crew.

B008HK3XYK|4.0|This case is just what I wanted for my Kindle Fire HD. It puts my kindle to sleep and when picked up, it's right where I left off...happy face! My grandson was surprised when he was using it and didn't quite understand the concept but was delighted that his game was where it was when he put the kindle down for a break. Too bad this case doesn't fit the kindle fire. Glad I purchased this, it was worth it!
B007BGQFTQ|5.0|I have decided to embrace my inner steampunk and a friend told me about this series.  It's all there - mystery, murder, romance and sex that doesn't make one gag.  Lots of imagination here and a knowledge of human inconsistencies and motivations.  I'm only sorry that I was so obsessed with them that I read them way too fast.  Definitely worth multiple re-reads.
1594744475|5.0|This book is darling! Full of recipes and ideas to make your kids' lunches healthy and fun to eat. Some of the ingredients are a little harder to come by, since it is Japanese food, but we were able to find viable substitutions for things. Our kids love when we use this book to make their lunches, and, surprisingly, they eat it all.

B001E2JNA6|5.0|This version is long.....like 5 hours long. But it is by far the best, and truest, version out there. Colin Firth plays the perfect Mr. Darcy. I dare anyone to watch this and not fall in love with him. Seriously. It is totally worth the 5 hours. I've seen other versions of P&P, and you don't get the whole story by only watching 2 hours. You get the full story in this version, and it's so excellently done, that you don't realize 5 hours have gone by.

My husband bought these for use with his MMOs and I have to yell pretty loud for him to hear me if his sound is up. The volume control is handy, right on the side of the headset. It has a usb cable it can charge with, but is also wireless. Very comfortable to wear, great sound quality.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I really loved both books by Sylvia Day, the crossfire series is absolutely wonderful and I can't wait til next one!
0061900656|5.0|I got this for my son when we had our baby. My whole pregnancy he would say (and keep in mind he was 5) &#34;I can't wait for sister to get here because she'll run with me and play with me and play video games.&#34;  He had a hard time understanding that baby wouldn't be able to do much of anything for a while. This book was the perfect illustration of what we had been trying to tell him for 9 months. We purchased it the day our daughter was born, and it got here just in time for us to take baby home. We read it to our son while we were still at the hospital, and it helped him adjust to the fact that baby wasn't going to be able to run around with him or share his toys and video games just yet. I'd recommend this to anyone who is adding a baby to their family. There is also a version called I'm a Big Sister, for the girls.

B003FVI2KQ|5.0|Bought this when we rebuilt our desktop computer. It's awesome. It runs 6 cores, is fast, and even though it isn't a Pentium, we're getting comparable speed for way cheaper cost. Perfect for gaming or an HTPC.
B005JABU82|4.0|bought as a holiday gift for my boyfriend, haven't given it to him yet but damn there are a lot of tiny pieces to his kit def not for beginners
B009GEDP26|5.0|I love seeing Castle at work and in HD! I will eventually buy the dvds but couldn't wait for the release! I was not disappointed!
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|Supposing we did make contact. All of the things we would have to deal with are beautifully weaved into the script. The machine is what I would call \\"true to life\\" if we were actually given the technology by a more advanced race. I'm convinced that folding or warping space-time is the way to travel to other worlds and demands an achievable amount of energy that we will soon be able to make. If we live long enough, this beautifully-made movie will become real life.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|it is ok would not pay money for it though.  restarted when I updated it the. shop glitches it is annoying overall it is fun
B001ED7C5I|3.0|I have two other CD's of Chapman and love both of them. I wasn't expecting all the songs about her religious views. It's okay, but wont be one of my favorites.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|It is wonderful being able to watch The Big Bang Theory whenever I want, and with a portable DVD player these DVDs keep all the passengers in the car entertained during long drives between St. Louis and Chicago.
B003UMW68Y|5.0|Even though I have a dvd of this movie I had to have it in blu-ray. It is amazing to watch. The extra content is quite interesting also. Well worth the price.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Really good. Bizarre but very interesting. The stupid choices we make as young adults can certainly have pretty drastic consequences!!!  We really should listen to what our parents tell us but we're just too stupid to get it at that age!  Recommend it for all ages except young children. Especially young teens so they maybe get a clue that u truly need to stop & think about the possible consequences of your behavior!!!
B009MF56GC|1.0|This pile of garbage feels like a seven year old child wrote a movie only using sounds and gesticulations.  The action is laughable.  Generic stuff laid out for old men in ridiculous situations.  Pretty much on par with every Stallone movie.  Buy the Raid: Redemption and be the cool AND tasteful gift giver.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Very interesting book. Really held my attention. Made me want to go on a backpacking adventure myself (tho not on the PCT)!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I had great difficulty putting this book down.  Kept me interested and wanting more!  Look forward to reading all off Mr howeys books.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|Awesome.... Excellent film....excellent blu-ray transfer....excellent audio....excellent score....excellent story.... All in all, pretty good stuff.... Most already know the story--I just want to say that the blu-ray is fantastic....great extras too....well worth the upgrade....get it....
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Couldn't put this book down and immediately had to order the sequels!  I would recommend this book for all age groups.  I'm 50 and enjoyed it the thoroughly.  The characters are well developed and either endearing or villainous in their own complex way.
B009FZFONO|5.0|The last season on The walking dead was not as action packed as I would have liked and people did a lot of idiotic things. This season they are all on there game, there is a little less arguing and judging from the first episode the rest of the season is going to be great.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm obsessed with this website on my computer, and was thrilled when they finally added an app for the Kindle. Lots of time can be wasted here. =)
B000I3P3EM|5.0|This is a great movie.  Wrath of Khan is still the best one.  I am a Star Wars fan more than anything, but ST is a close second.  Greatest ship ever - the Enterprise.  It's my best movie moment whenever the Enterprise fires and wins a space battle.<br /><br />Unfortunately this movie was the beginning of the end.  What came after this was never anything like this crew. Therefore I give it a five star.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|i loved the app SOOO much (in fact, i would've given it a five star) i just loved doodling with all my friends, but the other day i went to play it but when it started loading it went back to the homescreen. i tried again with the same results. i haven't been able to play since then. very sad!
B000067FP8|5.0|This is a sequel from the 1980s Gremlins, and it was so much better.  This super movie has different types of gremlins in it: there is a spider mutant, a gargoyle mutant gremlin and there's a gremlin that grows vegetables out of his body, but one gremlin talks...yes, talks.  He constantly says, \\"Let's be civilize about this....\\"  Well, someone needs to tell him that civilized does not mean \\"destroy New York.\\"  This is one of those rare movies that the sequel is better than the original, and I would recommend it to anyone 6 and up.  (Peyton, 11 years old)
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Macklemore is one of the most talented and under-rated musicians of the entire hip-hop genre. I enjoy every one of his albums and this one was a great addition to the previous three. Great beats, great style, and a great team with him and Ryan.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|I found this quite an enjoyable movie.  To me it's message was go for the future.  I felt this from the young man trying to make a success out of his hotel, actually out of his life. You felt this from the retirees who were willing to look at their future when they finally realized there was one. I felt very sorry for the one woman who could not accept change & returned to her past. Acting was superb, script, scenes, etc. perfect.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I LOVED THE STORY. IT KEPT MY INTEREST AND WAS HARD TO PUT DOWN. I HAD NOT READ ANY OF KATE MORTON'S BOOKS BEFORE,BUT DEFINITELY WILL READ MORE.
B005HSL626|1.0|3 problems with this app... first it asked me to download 2 seperate things then secondly it crashed my device third of all a video automatically popped up.... all this after not even 5 minutes of play... uninstall and bad review
B00A8ECU24|5.0|fun game, been waiting for the android port, worth the wait tho. it starts out a little slow, but gets a lot better. it isnt like other town sims, its better, and more addicting. Rating : Eeyup..
B0028IDXDS|5.0|Love this for new baby.  Monkey is so cute and very soft.  Great idea and pacifier isn't falling onto the floor all the time.
B000I2J6K0|5.0|I was looking for a challenging workout to help me stay in shape as I progressed through my 4th pregnancy.  I am a triathlete and have found videos in the past to be boring.  I was also having some pain in my back and couldn't run after my 16th week.  This video worked out my whole body and gave me a good sweat.  I really liked the pilates and dance portions.  In addition, there was something in the stretches/strengthening that helped my back.  I was able to do this video until the very end.
1452110581|5.0|Any cat lover will appreciate these poems. They're so cute, so funny and so true.  Giving it to a cat loving friend.
B009E3EY38|5.0|The concert footage is truly stellar, Its been a long time coming indeed!Jason dose a fine job standing in for his late dad.  I'm happy this was done, as a lifelong fan of Zeppelin, the wait was worth it. Outstanding!!!

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Omg the best book in the world!  I love this book there needs to be a new one soon or I will die!
B007W8S2MG|5.0|If you're a fan of persona series this is a must have, especially since it has a lot of new added content. Even if you're new to the persona series, Persona 4 The Golden is a good choice to start your persona experience. 10/10 game.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The app is amazing... However, I would like to see a couple things different in the next update: the enchanting table, and possibly, could you make it possibleto switch from creative to survival mode in game? Thanks!
B008YWY0HK|2.0|For me this movie was a prime example of misleading previews!!  I went into this movie thinking I was going to see the story of a princess who fights to keep her freedom...and to be honest I kind of got that for the first 20 minutes of the movie.  She quickly looses the battle has a tantrum and runs away, gets a potion from a witch and turns her mom and 3 siblings into bears.  Then realizes that maybe she shouldn't have done that and tries to get an antidote before her father kills said bears.  I found the story to be very boring and in general badly written.  I didn't care about any of the characters, which surprises me so much as this came from Pixar and they ALWAYS get me to care about the characters.  The animation was stunning that's why it gets 2 stars.
B004SBQAN8|5.0|Based off the book.... Really good interpretation of it. Spot on, or nearly! Please make more of the books into movies!!
B008ULM7HU|5.0|top notch collection of some of the best and favorites,different styles from different artists create the music of Duran Duran.the music of 80 through 89.are featured.maybe someday colletion2 from 90 to 2000 ?..........the bands still going.
0385344333|4.0|Nothing her that hasn't been done first in the Travis McGee series by John McDonald in the 1960s but this is well executed, modernized and features a main character who you want to meet again.  Time for Mr. Child to give Reacher a little more dimension--but I'll keep reading whether this best selling athor takes my advice or not.
B009329ZF2|5.0|My fiance loved this movie so we bought it for him for christmas,<br />Dec. 2012.<br />The aliens were really different.
B000OVLINI|4.0|I love the intense writng and plotting in this book and the semi-sequel the Angel's game.  It's Gothic, set in Barcelona, a city the author obviously knows and loves.  It takes some perserverance--although the writing is quite good it does go on and the plot moves slowly as a  result.  It drew me in, but someone who needs escapism and a quick read may want to take a look at the Odd Thomas (Dean Koontz) series which I have also reviewed.  I will read all of Zafon's books and probably reread many of them.  Just plain good...
B005LAII9O|4.0|Entertaining - a little less action than I expected but a solid story and a good time to watch.  The quality on the blu-ray is great, and it includes both the ultraviolet digital version AND a downloadable digital copy.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|As all Pixar films, BRAVE is beautiful to look at!  The story could have been ... I dunno ... richer? It has kind of a Brother Bear-meets-Little-Mermaid going on. Girl defies parents, makes a mess, etc... I wanted to love it, but it was a tad boring.<br /><br />The \\"nudity\\" people complained about is laughable -- surely everyone knows about Scotland & kilts. A few butts is hardly any worse than Shrek (not Disney, I realize) saying, \\"I've got to save me a$$!\\".<br /><br />BRAVE is okay, but not destined to be my favorite.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love that this follows on where Oregon trail left off. if you love crafting then this game is for you.
B009AJD5E0|3.0|The movie trailers and teasers made me really want to watch this movie.  But, I was disapointed in the actual movie.  Come on, you travel thousands of light years to research our beginnings and you don't bring military flood lights for the big scary cave...things that make you go hmmmm. Most of the action scenes were ok. Really not impressed overall.

B001GCUNWQ|1.0|I have loved all the Ice Age Movies and this one is just as good.  I will be ordering the Christmas one and the last one.  We got this movie and let me tell you that the cover was torn and the movie does not play.  I will have to order another one and the grand kids wanted to watch it and I had to go to the library.  This is the second movie/game that has been bad--Amazon.
0345479092|5.0|I got this book when I was pregnant with my 2nd child. There are so many things in this book that have helped! Even though I already had a child this helped so much with little things I had forgotten. Sad she isnt alive anymore.

B008AK8FHM|3.0|Was a little too technical for me and hard to follow.  However, it was still an interesting read.  Really makes you think...
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|i think it was a good book because wene he was in the dance he felt a little acward. and becace they had a real life insident with the chicen pox
0439321603|5.0|This is a terrific and fun-filled addition to your Potter library. I love the notes on the margins from Harry and Ron. If you're like me and are fascinated with everything related to the world of Potter, you will enjoy this book. I liked this one a lot better than Quidditch through the Ages, but maybe that's because I find animals infinitely more interesting than sports.
B004Q3SGWG|1.0|This is a really \\"cool\\" film with really \\"cool\\" \\"music\\" about a really \\"cool\\" guy who likes hot chicks, rides mountains bikes and takes lots of cool pictures... of himself. Because he's THAT cool. So like after we fully appreciate his coolness, the dude gets his right hand trapped by a rock and stands there for like 127 hours swearing and dreaming of water and a really cool chick. Finally he gets like so thirsty that he cuts his arm off with a Swiss Army knife. It's really cool too cause like we get to watch him cut a nerve and it's like a rubber band dude. With a lot of cool blood. And then he gets rescued and marries this really cool chick even though he has like just one arm.<br />Seriously, this is just a very bad and deeply boring film about nothing much more than an auto-amputation. I suggest not paying the price, but if you must, just move to 1 hour and fifteen minutes,  enjoy \\"the\\" scene and then close the film and return to whatever you were doing.

So I decided to download all 3 books as a package....I started the first book & only made it to ..... Well not far at all ... Maybe only the first few chapters.... Just up until she was welcomed into his &#34;secret room&#34; .... Well....what can I say... I was just not that interested .... Obviously it wasn't for me...... I am no prude but....well.....Everyone raved about !!! I wanted to be interest ... But .... It wasn't for me. Kudos to all that enjoyed it ! I wish I could have. Maybe I'll try it again later .......

1594744769|3.0|Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children starts out with a fanfare of promise.<br />The strange photos dispersed throughout the story riveted my attention and, as they were intended to, pulled me into the book's pages, which, I was delighted to find, were very well written. I was captivated by Riggs's taught and incisive prose--no redundancy, no dangling modifiers, no really bad grammar, just the right word every time. And I wallowed in memorable turns of phrase that seemed to cascade off the pages: \\"plaster colonnades that seemed almost delusionally aspirational\\"; \\"the sky was turning the color of a fresh bruise\\"; \\"sheep stared at us with big leaky eyes\\"; \\"looking like a beggar evangelist in his torn black suit,\\" just to quote a few. The story content got off to a good, meaty start too with references to the WWII holocaust, which had affected the main character's grandfather.<br /><br />I was engrossed in the story, happily cruising along, even dismissing the odd lapse of originality (\\"coiled like a spring\\"), until it occurred to me that the narrator, Jacob, is not an adult looking back on events of his youth, but a teenager--a boy of sixteen going on sixty. The author may have intended the narrator of the story to be a mature Jacob, but that idea isn't made clear and in any case wouldn't make sense, for reasons I can't mention here without giving the plot away. Suffice it to say that time travel can have youthful effects.<br /><br />That was the first jolt. The second jolt came when I realized the story was not going to be unusual, or something a young adult would enjoy. I had thought the historic component would play an invigorating role in the storyline, but it didn't. The story turned out to be a children's adventure story, replete with ghouls and time travel. The trouble is most children of adventure story age--seven through eleven--won't have the vocabulary to tackle a lot of the text; they'd spend more time with their noses in a dictionary than in Riggs'sbook. Young adults can certainly deal with the sophistication of the writing, but they'll be disappointed with the adventure story.<br /><br />Now, when I picked up the book, I had no idea of what the story might be about. I did, however, expect something more original, perhaps more mysterious, perhaps creative nonfiction, but certainly more thought-provoking than monsters and time travel, and the sophisticated prose fooled me into believing the book had been written for young adults. I've rarely been so confused by a work of fiction.<br /><br />I give Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children one star for the creative touch of unusual photos, one star for masterful prose, and one star for good narrative flow.

B004YM6JP0|5.0|I've been a fan of the show since season one.  Season 3 did not disappoint!  The chemestry between Nina Dobrev's Elena and Ian Somerhalder's Damon sizzles.  The show is well written with cool supernatural characters and storylines. I never planned on watching this show, but my assistant would rave about it every Friday and suggested I catch a week long marathon of the first 10 episodes. I was hooked from that point on. Can't wait to check out some of the cool extras on the blu ray set!
1442359315|5.0|The author did an excellent job  of recall and description of his experience,  Almost took you back there with him in time.  He explained things in a very clear and understandable way as to stay with him on his journey and get a glimps of the other-side.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|this is a pre order item, so I can only base my review on the film, which I really liked! Renner is one of my favorite actors and his performance always brings depth to the character. I thought the action sequences were adrenaline pumping.  The film was a little slow in starting, but overall a good start to a new series of Bourne films.

LOOOVEEED IT!
B007THA4FI|4.0|Rowlings educates readers about a London they may not know exists. The adolescents are dark and needy like their adult counterparts. Vengeance proves futile and sad. The broken are never fixed, but the survivors are stronger and more compassionate as a result of their travails.  A fast-paced and engaging book.
B008XG1X18|3.0|don't go there much as of yet so really can't say one way or the other but hope to use it more
B000I8HIR2|3.0|this movie was not as scary as i thought itd be but either way it was entertaining not worth 8 bucks tho maybe like 5
0316228532|2.0|I have often struggled to describe my view of heaven, but when it comes to depicting hell, read The Casual Vacancy.<br />I found this book depressing almost from the get-go. I continued to read it to see if a redeeming quality would emerge. None did. Profanity depresses me. I was disappointed that the language of almost no one in the story could get past this adolescent vernacular. And it wasn't just the unimaginative foul language: worse, it was the extreme unimaginative quality of people's inner thoughts and values, the tiny size of their world. Rowling is an expert in her craft - she knows how to write - but she appears to have selected material inspired by some personal hellish experiences in life and upbringing, and chosen to share this with the world. Not one character in this story was happy. Don't be surprised if you too are not happy when you lay it down.

B008JGSM6G|4.0|The concept for this reminds me of connect-the-dots from when I was little, but with no pictures, just colors.  I find myself wanting a perfect score every single time.  Simple yet fun and just enough challenge.  Good way to fidget.

0307949486|3.0|OK, I've watched this book to suddenly show up on the bookstore shelf, quickly occupy the Most Popular category and then slowly sunset into the bargain bin. At which point I stopped dragging my feet and actually read it.<br /><br />On the positive side, the book is very readable, the plot realistic enough, the writing style robust and engaging. If you want a crime novel that doesn't make you feel an idiot after you've read it, this one fits the bill pretty well.<br /><br />(SPOILERS AHEAD!!!)<br /><br />The book is not perfect though. The characters, so realistic and believable for the most of the narration go haywire toward the end. The main protagonist, an Aspberger syndrome afflicted girl with history of abuse and uncanny investigative skills turns into a super-hacker easily penetrating any computer system, manipulating major financials transactions and camouflaging as other people with the ease that should make James Bond cringe with envy. One of the two antagonists, who starts as a fairly believable financier, who has some skeletons in the closet, and is not particularly picky about means, turns into a quintessence of evil, doing deals with anyone from the Russian Mafia to the Colombian drug cartels, trading enriched uranium etc. All of this definitely spoils an otherwise good book.<br /><br />The other issue with the book is a constant treatment with the Author's view on the social justice. We are constantly reminded that the financial markets are merely parasites on the Swedish economy, that the big Companies are no more than a bunch of fraudsters. Same with the Author's view on what justice means. Apparently, it is perfectly acceptable to hack into other people's computers - even more so when they are bad guys. Using emails and documents obtained by these means is apparently perfectly fine as well - it's used for a good goal after all. One might argue that these views are those of the book characters and not of the Author, but they are way too explicit in the book to be ignored.<br /><br />Overall, the book is not bad - nice read for a crime novel but with its own shortcomings. Based on the developments toward the end, I have a feeling the two sequel books will not be as good but this remains to be seen.e book to be ignored.<br /><br />Overall, the book is not bad - nice read for a crime novel but with its own shortcomings.

B008VIKLWA|5.0|I call this my \\"Feel Good Movie\\"....when I am depressed, or overwhelmed, I think about this sweet, sweet movie and feel better.  It is a triumph of an orphan chimp over his fate....would recommend for every one.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|Only Japanese movies have the remarkable ability to probe and display the subtle human emotions.<br /> I have seen this movie about 6 times and it has enriched me every time. Cello theme music  is haunting and gets under my skin.<br /> Highly recommended to view this movie at least two times to really appreciate it.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Came quickly, and is just as good as it was in theaters :) So happy to own this movie! Love!

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I was afraid of where the first book was going to end up.  I was starting to question Christian and how “dark\\" he seemed. The second book explained all the roles of the characters as if they are right in front of you. I've never felt so much emotion in a book. Oh how I love the way Christian turned out to be! This is the perfect way to the \\"middle “ book.

B005G4TJI4|5.0|really great movie packed with a lot of action keeps you off on the edge you don't get bored or tired of watch it always something happening
B007SGLZP8|1.0|Lack of character development and predictable plot lines result in a book that was clearly made hoping that someone will turn the idea into a better screenplay and film.<br /><br />This isn't worth reading.<br /><br />Grisham used to write good books, but has clearly gotten lazy.
B0086700CM|5.0|omg I played it once and now I'm super super super super super super super super super addicted!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! o my God :) this is the best game in the history of games squeeeeeeee!
B0087JTAKW|4.0|This book was as good as the other books that I have read by Mitch Albom. A pleasure to read.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Its a pretty good app to have for just anything you would like to jot down. I'm actually using it as a journal of my senior year, so I could look back at my youth when I'm old and past my prime. Plus, the only way I'd lose it is if I lost my memory of all my passwords, or if the Internet no longer existed.

B005CRQ2IU|5.0|I've long been a Watchmen fan and I love his interpretation of the superhero genre, his alternate history, the atmosphere and the questions raised by unique characters. Moore was one of the first to see what could be done with comic books, and he led the way for others.<br /><br />I was skeptical that the comic book format would come through on a Kindle device, but how wrong I was. The colors are crisp and the text perfectly legible in a user-friendly format.<br /><br />There's not much else I can say about Watchmen that hasn't been said before, or would risk spoiling the many mysteries. All I can say is: get a copy. Paper or eletronic, it doesn't matter. Get a copy and read it.
B00821PBIK|5.0|Love this series and I bet season 2 will be even better. Special effects are outstanding for television and some of the lead characters are already unforgetable. The sets! my my ! Fascinating! Love the abandoned homes of the suburbanites,how the tiny touching details, each one telling a story, creates a real background of silent pathos for the good in our society.
B009VB9VKY|1.0|Skip this one!  The reviews lead me to believe it was good - so much for trusting reviewers.  Worst movie in years.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Having hiked a fair amount in my day all over the West and Pacific Northwest and gone into the back country of the Boundary Waters and Quetico, I know what it is like to challenge yourself on the trail.  What it takes physically and more importantly mentally.  She does an amazing job of describing the personal fortitude it takes to climb mountains.  To wrestle with all your thoughts or personal demons as you put one foot in front of the other on a seemingly infinite trail.  But also, to convey the rewards you get from your suffering, when you reach the top of the mountain.  She is completely unprepared for such a long trek, but has the fortitude and quite a bit of luck to survive it.  It is a charming reminder of my own wilderness adventures from my 20s, the age she is when she undertakes her adventures.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Heard so many pros and cons about this series.  I decided to find out for myself.  Much enjoyed the story and where it began and ended.
B005LAJ212|5.0|This is quite possibly the best drama on television as of current. Not only did the story-line fit together flawlessly but the acting is believable and fantastic. If you appreciate a \\"smart\\" drama that requires thinking then I recommend this show for you as well. You won't regret watching it!
B0091REZMW|3.0|This game is fun but there is not enough information given to the player so they know what they are doing.  All these things are floating around the screen and I don't know what they mean or what to do with them.
B0058YPL66|4.0|Once Upon A Time (2011) is definitely an intriguing show that has a story-plot that hasn't really been explored too much on TV. With that said the show excels in many areas such as being able to integrate the \\"Fairy Tale\\" world with the \\"Real World\\" (Storybrooke, Maine) and still be able to make sense. Additionally, the show has a great ensemble of incredibly talented actors and actresses such as Jennifer Morrison (from critically acclaimed drama - \\"House\\") and Ginnifer Goodwin. Definitely a must-see, although, beware this show DOES NOT always resemble what the old fairy-tale characters look like.
B004GYNPL2|5.0|Very configurable app. Lots of fields and options to list any kind of info. Self destruct feature is great if someone gets your phone and try's to get app open.

B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game ever . 0.5.0 update is awesome I play it every day . It is worth it to pay $7
B0098460O4|5.0|My wife loves this CD. Her review: This CD is wonderful. Jonathan is on the way to be one of the greatest tenors and is just 16!WOW<br />Charlotte's  voice complements his very well. Overall very pleasant to listen to.
B005CRQ4GU|2.0|This is a good book . not as funny as his other ones though. I will give it 3 stars
1439192812|5.0|I bought this book when my daughter was born because I sort of jumped the gun on what I should be reading to her :) As it is, she likes it when I read to her from this book just as much as she likes some of her simple kiddie books. The pictures are lovely, and the ideas are presented in a simple and understandable way. I hope as she grows older and understands it she will enjoy it as much as I have enjoyed it while reading it to her.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is wonderful for kids. its fun its awesome. I love the game my self its just so much fun when your bored.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Best season so far. Action packed. Season keeps true to what season 1 started with there being plenty of zombie killing
B00377V6J2|4.0|Great duo! Definitely lost SRV too soon.  One of the best jam session live dvds ever.  SRV and King flow great together.  Must have for guitarists and blues lovers.
B0001I562I|5.0|Im not writing a review on how I like the movie. I am just reviewing the product as a item since I knew the movie and have watched it alot as a ki, I just wanted to buy it on DVD and relive my childhood. lol<br /><br />Disk was good, no playback problems at all. I will say look around at ur local big box stores because alot of times u can find old movies in the $5 bin. I couldnt find it at my local stores so I went ahead and got mine here and payed the shipping.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|This book was a little too much in to the science of things for me. It was a good book but not too good of a story.
B0063IH60K|5.0|i downloaded this app because though i am not typically a fan of games, i am pregnant and stuck in bed.  i don't have to put a lot of thought into this, but there are enough options to keep me occupied for a while.  there are ads after each game, but  simple click and i'm back to the next deal.

B009CPJHY4|5.0|Terrific acting by some of the most wonderful British stars...and especially enjoyed the humor and sensitivity throughout the movie.  If you love India, you will enjoy this movie.  Now that I have reached my Senior years, I can appreciate all of the life decisions made in this movie.  Loved it.
0199535981|5.0|My friend told me about this book, maybe 2 months ago or so. His reccomendation was so promising that I was eager to get this book. After about a week I was in a bookshop and I saw this book, immediatly I had to buy it, and it was so cheap.<br />I've read it in a week or so, and after I finished it, I opened the first page and began reading again - thats how marvelous this book is. The dialogues are so thrilling and full of witty but thought provoking aphorisms, especially from Lord Henry (one of the characters). For example: \\"I am too fond of reading books to care to write them.\\",<br />\\"Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing.\\" ,<br />\\"Humanity takes itself too seriously. It is the world's original sin. If the cave-man had known how to laugh, History would have been different.\\"<br />Wilde writes so naturally, with no stifness and with so much humour!<br />I won't go into the subject matter because you can get that anywhere on google. But I will tell you that this novel made me a fan of Wilde and also made me read more of his work!<br />Next week I plan on getting his plays (also from Oxford World's Classics, because they put so much to provide you with a good introduction, chronology and resources about the book, and the format is beautiful and easy too read).<br />It's not hard cover, but I like it better as a paperback, it is not thick and you can take it anywhere with you, and its cover and design is unique.
B008Y2VTIS|4.0|Good acting & addictive story.  First season was better - this one was not quite as good.  I wonder what Nucky will do next season when he discovers his new wife made him an involuntary philanthropist.

B003GSLX5Y|5.0|I enjoy the idea that I have digital access to the reference on my tablet notebook. It makes writing on the go much easier.
0345803485|1.0|So, I read the first book and while it was interesting at times, overall I found it to be really unbelievable and at times the writing annoying.<br />It was annoying every time there was a \\"oh my\\" or something about Ana biting her lips.<br />I don't think it helped that the writer was British.<br />because a lot of her expressions didn't seem normal for an american girl.<br />(there were so many \\"oh my\\"'s on every other page that it was annoying, or \\"have a coffee\\" instead of \\"have coffee\\", \\"Jeez\\")<br />i did not believe at all this was an american girl<br /><br />ana and christian are ok characters<br />but the writing was very annoying at times (actually Ana is a good character but the lines that the writer gives her are really annoying)<br />and a lot of what christian did wasn't sexy<br /><br />in summary, the writing is terrible, what could have been otherwise a good story is completely ruined by the writer<br />i hope the movie script is completely rewritten by american writers<br />and that the movie will be much better<br /><br />annoying things:<br />-blushing, flushing<br />-expressions that ana (who is supposedly an american girls) says that are clearly not american<br />-repetitiveness<br />-pursing lips<br />-pressing mouth into a hard line<br />-people \\"murmur\\"ing<br />-muttering<br />-frowns, grins

1439102813|5.0|I enjoyed this compelling novel, and couldn't wait to get back to it each time I had to put it down.  It's a fascinating journey which illustrates, from the inside out, what happens when dementia gradually takes over.  Alice is tenderly portrayed as her disease progresses.  The only caveat to readers is--do not blow out of proportion any memory lapses you have while reading the book!  (Or maybe that's just me.)

B0083SBMBM|3.0|I'm excited that this movie made nearly a billion dollars at the box office because it's not loaded with sex, vulgarity and raunch but I don't get what all the excitement is about.  I rented the DVD and it was just as good as many other well done special effects movie.  So, if you like fast action special effects with a touch of humor, you'll like Marvel's The Avengers.  But don't expect anything extraordinary.
0307720748|5.0|Great story. Very funny. Well written. Richard Branson has goot a great personality, and that comes through in the book. The last 50 pages or so are a bit boring.. the rest of the book is really entertaining.

B008CJ0KI8|5.0|I think Frank Ocean is one of those artists that despite being in a environment where materialism and bragging is the rule, he manages to transmit a deeper message. He is a brilliant songwriter, wise beyond his years. He has not been famous for a long time but he already can picture what that means without making a big deal out of it like Kanye or Usher. His songs in CO show a deeper sensibility and great sense of style, criticism and clever lyrics. Definitely someone to check out in the future.

B005DJGMQE|5.0|I love historical fiction, and while this is really based on a true story, much of the dialogue was invented. It was historically very accurate, not at all boring, and gave a great impression of how the trial could have gone. A very fascinating side to a story we all know!
B007L6VR12|2.0|Artsy-fartsy trifle with striking, pointless images,wooden acting, and a childish plot. Do not waste your time. Every time you think things will pick up, they do not.

It also has root functions that can be turned on in the settings menu if you are rooted.<br /><br />Works great on my Kindle Fire HD 7 and 8.9

B007FDE4Y8|3.0|I purchased this to use with my Nex 5n and the kit 18-55mm lens (at 18mm).    Note, there is no instructions with this. This is the BEST GUIDE for this stabilizer:    [...]    Overall it was ok, and with practice you can get some good results. Would I buy this again.... No. I'd pay extra and get the Glidecam 4000HD.    Firstly I'll start with the positives and then get onto my issues:    1. Feels solid and well built. I don't think its going to be breaking anytime soon.  2. The gimble is very smooth and the turning nob is very useful.  3. Various camera attachment options.    Right, now lets start with my issues:    1. Main issue is that there is not enough incremental weights!    There is no way on this earth that you could balance it on my Sony NEx 5n, with the 3 weights supplied. Of the two options that you have one is way too light and the other way too heavy. And I'm certain other people will have the same problem with their cameras. Adjusting the angle of the arm just does not provide enough flexibility.    My understanding is that the camera and the bottom weights should be in balance. This does not mean the same. For me, I had to have around 3-4x as much weight on the top plate than at the bottom. You will have to experiment.    My solution for this was to go down to my local mitre 10 with the stabiliser and buy a big bolt, along with a big bunch of washers. I'm sorry I dont have the sizes for these but if you go down to your local hardward store I'm sure you'll find some. What I found was that there is a thread on the inside of the stabilising arm into which you can screw a large bolt.    I then weighed the bolt and washers against my camera until I found the correct number of washers to match my camera and lens. Then I added these washers to the bolt and screwed these into the bottom. This was MUCH better than the options provided by Opteka.    Now although this worked, I found that balancing was very difficult and extremely temperamental. You will have topractice a lot. I then added extra weight to the platform at the top next to my camera. For every 4 washers on top I was adding one to the bottom counterweight. This extra weight definitely enhanced the ability to balance the camera.    Therefore I would say that this works better with a heavier camera than my Sony nex 5n.    2. Very temperamental and when put down goes out of balance easily    I found that the best way to combat this was to screw the silver knobs almost tight before fine tuning the balancing. Even with them screwed tight I could still turn the balancing knobs. Then once balanced perfectly I really tighten the silver screws to ensure that there could be no movement. This was much better.    Anyway, they are my main gripes, and quite big ones. Good luck if you purchase it. I hope this helps.    Rich

B009HEP41A|4.0|Anna Karenina is a classic of Russian literature, written by the celebrated author Leo Tolstoy in 1873. It tells the story of the titular character, Anna, a Moscow socialite married to the taciturn Alexei Karenin, a stoic Government official 20 years her senior. Anna's life is thrown into turmoil when she meets and falls for the dashing Count Vronsky, a handsome and wealthy cavalry officer who sweeps Anna off her feet, and shows her the true meaning of love. However, repressive societal norms, pressure from friends and family, and Anna's own insecurities about what she wants from life means that her difficult choice between a safe, but dull life with Karenin and a wild, but potentially ostracizing life with Vronsky becomes agonizing. The story has been told on film many times over the years; this lavish new version is directed by Joe Wright from a screenplay by Tom Stoppard, stars Keira Knightley as Anna, Jude Law as Alexei, and Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Vronsky, and has a stellar supporting cast that includes Kelly Macdonald, Olivia Williams, Emily Watson and Matthew Macfadyen.<br /><br />The score for Anna Karenina is by the Anglo-Italian composer Dario Marianelli, who worked with director Wright on Pride and Prejudice in 2005 and won an Academy Award for his score for their film Atonement in 2007. As one might expect given the subject matter and the time period in which the film is set, Marianelli's score is very, very classical, and is generally built around a series of opulent waltzes. Marianelli's use of waltzes throughout the score is clearly intended to mirror the dance-like courtship and love triangle between Anna, Alexei and Vronsky, as the central figures move about between each other in an increasingly complicated web of deceit, passion and anger, fueled by Anna's continual oscillation between the two men in her life.<br /><br />There is a central recurring theme heard throughout the score - a four-note motif very similar to James Horner's danger motif that first appears in \\"Clerks\\" and is subsequently restated throughout the score, most notably in \\"Anna's Last Train\\" - but strongly identifiable thematic content is not the crux of the score in terms of it being the most memorable element. Instead, the various instrumental textures and recurring compositional styles characterize Marianelli's work; in terms of orchestration, the score relies heavily on a string and woodwind-led orchestra, with only the merest hints of brass and percussion. Like Jane Eyre before it, Anna Karenina also acts as a showcase for the violin performances of the British wunderkind Jack Liebeck, whose sumptuous solos can be heard in several cues, notably the opening \\"Overture\\", \\"Unavoidable\\", and \\"I Don't Want You To Go\\". For me, a more solid thematic core would have made the score a little more approachable, but despite this small drawback Marianelli's lavish music remains interesting for its duration.<br /><br />Cues such as \\"Anna Marches into a Waltz\\", \\"Kitty's Debut\\" and \\"Dance With Me\\" conjure up imagery of well-heeled gentlemen and beautiful women in fine gowns lavishly courting each other in glittering Romanov ballrooms. \\"Dance With Me\\", especially, is a very clever cue which becomes more frantic, dissonant and disjointed as it progresses as Anna is literally swept of her feet by Vronsky, causing her previously ordered and cautious world to be thrown into chaos.<br /><br />Russian folk music plays a major part in the score too, and to capture its authenticity Marianelli often highlights traditional local instrumentation, including balalaikas and garmon accordions. There is also a great deal of regional dance pastiche in the form of mazurka-style pieces that give the score a distinctly classic Russian flavor. \\"She Is of the Heavens\\", for example, has a section for whistlers and a lyrical vocal performance over a bold, vibrant traditional melody for clarinets, while later tracks such as \\"The Girl and the Birch\\" use new performances of an old Russian folk song called `Beroza' to excellent effect. The \\"Can Can\\" is a wild gypsy dance piece that is wonderfully anarchic, while at the other end of the scale the opera cue \\"At the Opera\\" sets Tolstoy's own words from Anna Karenina Part 2 Chapter 9 to a classically inflected orchestral melody that is very effective.<br /><br />As the score develops into its second half it becomes more serious, and more conventionally romantic, capturing both the passionate relationship between Anna and Vronsky, and the subsequent devastating fallout she suffers, both in her marriage to Karenin, and her standing in Muscovite social circles. Cues such as \\"I Don't Want You To Go\\", \\"Too Late\\" and \\"Leaving Home and Coming Home\\" give Liebeck the chance to convey assorted tortured emotions through his violin performances, while the lush and emotional \\"Lost in a Maze\\", the unexpectedly powerful \\"A Birthday Present\\", and truly sumptuous \\"I Know How To Make You Sleep\\" allows the full orchestra to rise to the fore in some of the score's few moments of overwhelming thematic beauty. It is these cues that will undoubtedly capture the attention of those who fell in love with Marianelli's earlier romance scores.<br /><br />Anyone who came to Marianelli through scores like Pride & Prejudice and Jane Eyre will find a great deal of the latter half of Anna Karenina to their liking, but your tolerance for the classic waltzes and intentionally authentic Russian folk music that makes up most of the first half of the score will determine your level of appreciation for the CD as a whole. The lack of a truly memorable main theme may make Anna Karenina a little impenetrable for some, too. Personally I found the Anna Karenina to be a richly orchestrated and beautifully performed score which is perfect for the film, which is unfortunately missing that tantalizing, elusive `something' that would otherwise result in multiple returns to the soundtrack.
B008QE9VJI|5.0|I rented the movie, watched it, and immediately bought it.  I just loved this movie.  I was well scripted, well acted, and just downright fun for anybody old enough to remember the original TV show.  Personally, I think one needs to have the reference from the original TV show to really appreciate the director and actors wonderful performance.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Food, Inc is a good movie for anyone interested in the food industry.  It is a little disturbing.  It does open up your eyes.
0786962984|5.0|Bought this game to play with my spouse- both of us are passingly familiar with the Dungeons & Dragons universe, but have never actually played a game. Dungeon! has been simplified so that you don't need a Game Master, you just roll the dice and explore areas around the board. When we played, we stretched our imaginations and actually did roleplay one of the pre-established characters, at least in the sense of how our characters entered each room and defeated each enemy. This would be a great way to introduce a younger kid to the series.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this for anyone wants to test the water in role-playing. If you don't want to take the effort to think up and describe your actions as you move around the board, I wouldn't recommend-- that's the best part!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Movie came on time and is fun to watch. I can't wait for the next one. . . . .

B000YMM3CC|5.0|What I liked about this movie is that it was original. It's not your typical corny sappy love story. It has depth that I feel many people can relate to. We all know what it's like to be young and in love and this makes for a great love story. Take a chance. It's worth watching.
1455502758|4.0|\\"Mortality\\" is a slim volume of essays written by a dying man.  Hitchens, an avowed atheist, was famously diagnosed with cancer and in a series of articles first written for Vanity Fair chronicled both his decline as well as how he became the focus of a debate over questions about God and faith.<br /><br />Never shy about skewering sacred cows, Hitchens takes on conventions such as how all those diagnosed with cancer seem to \\"bravely\\" battle on - and even questions the very concept of a \\"war on cancer\\" itself.  He discusses the debate that swirled around his illness and condition, never wavering from his atheist views, and records some of the mundane, the treatments and the fatigue related to being so gravely ill.<br /><br />Although the topics are somewhat interesting, and the discussions well written, it is the overall ordinariness of this book that is most valuable.  In the preface and afterward to the book Hitchens is lauded as an extraordinary person of inestimable talent and intellect.  It would seem, though, just as we all put on our pants one leg at a time (well, perhaps except for circus performers) we all are destined to shuck off our mortal coil, as has been said, and \\"Mortality\\" takes us briefly and superficially into that part of the human experience to which we will all be subject.  If there is comfort here, a book written by a dying atheist as he loses the things he values most - his voice, his pen, and then his life - it is that he makes the voyage almost seem ordinary, which of course is something that American society has a hard time accepting.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|Brilliant, entertaining, exciting, and heartfelt novel that recreates India in an unique way. The story was so irresistibly compelling that I couldn't put the book down.
B005LAIIS0|5.0|It is the kind of movie that stays with you, and makes you think seriously about life and death.  Not in the sugary sweet \\"i love life\\" and \\"everything is beautiful\\" kind of way.  But the honest, brutal reality that we all are going to have to face death, and how we do it will define us as much as how we lived our lives.

B005KELW26|5.0|I have been using this case for a year now with frequent and heavy use. It's a simple and protective barrier that will keep your Kindle from getting scratches. It's very convenient while reading for me because the case design allows the front cover to flip all the way to the back and clasp with the magnet in the open position. I often find myself catching up on a few pages while waiting in lines or on the train and find this case to be perfect for my needs because I don't have to actually remove any straps or bands to access the device. After the one I have wears out, I'll most likely be purchasing this same one again.

0857685848|5.0|Buy it.<br />Without reservation, buy it.<br /><br />Not every illustration is excellent, and there is one I would describe as quite poor. However, most are absolutely outstanding and more than outweigh the (few) disappointing illustrations.<br />If you are even vaguely interested in paleontology, buy this book, the artwork gives a amazing new perspective on extinct life (not just dinosaurs).<br /><br />One of the best books on ancient life I have encountered, a comment I make from the standpoint of quite a substantial collection of such books.
B000002KYR|5.0|Added to my large cd collection with another oldie but goodie.Best power trio ever.Never get enough of ZZ Top. Great stuff
0060723513|4.0|I decided to write a review after reading reviews ranging from very positive to very negative.  The book is some 200 pages and I read it over a month so for me it was not a big investment of my time.  I did enjoy the story and journey taken by Ms Morgan in the unknown world of Australian Aborigines.  I can't quiet say that this is the best fiction I have ever read.  However, I don't think this book boring at all, there are many other books out there are boring and this is not one of them.  The message author is trying to deliver is a spiritual one based on a frame work of her experience in outback.  Positive reviews are coming from people who appreciated this message about spirituality and opposite reviews are arising from inaccuracy of this outback experience.<br />While reading this book I naturally started to take mental notes about all the details provided about outback and about the people author had met.  I did question her detailed memory over the 3 to 4 month period that is the base of this whole book.  Author strategically excluded all the details that can positively verify some of her claims about the time she spent with real people.  Few of the other reviewers with specific knowledge of this real people and from Australia also point out irregularities about this account.  So, anyone after reading this book can easily poke enough holes about her account.  I would have to admit that I think it does not take enormous effort to refute this account if you methodically collect and analyze all the facts of her account laid out by Ms. Marlow.  In any case this book is a work of fiction so perhaps it would be a futile effort to begin with.<br />On the other hand if you just focus on the message that author is trying to deliver then it makes a worthwhile reading experience.  The message is about way we live vs. aborigines have been living.  It is hard to refute the facts about damages we have done to this planet for our own benefit and have denied equal rights to other species.  By learning the way aborigines live author highlights how we are so engaged in material world dominated by fear and greed among other vices.  We often fail to conduct ourselves on a more spiritual level and fail to adhere to greater good practice of life.  The strength of this book lies in delivering this message in an interesting way that author has done.  Therefore, I enjoyed reading it and recommend it to anyone.  The message in this book is not new to anyone and most people are aware of this.  However, the difficulty lies in truly embracing the change and leaving our comfort zone.  Conversations between author and aborigines during her time in the outback have some profound wisdom concepts.  One of the statements made by elder that I liked is below.<br />\\"Do humans know that extinction of any species also means that humans are also closer to their extinction?\\" - By aborigine elder<br />In summary, I think this book is a good read.  Don't get caught up in verifying any of the details about author's trip and try to figure out it was real or not.  For me the message was thought provoking and it should be enough to occupy our thoughts about how we can improve our way of living.
B005ELZKWS|5.0|Great super group. VAN WHO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LOve Sammy  and this band.Truly a great great band.Waiting for the next album by the &#34;FOOT&#34;
B00637HXNG|4.0|I bought this as my second Scorpions concert disc, after Wacken Live Open Air 2006. I have not been able to view this in 3D yet, but on my regular tv screen it shows great. Only after looking at the making of it on the bonus reel does one get a true impression of how monumentous a task putting this together must have been. Given the size of the crowd, they really need to sell a lot of these to start turning a profit when one thinks of how expensive it is to record, edit and master an entire concert in 3D.<br /><br />I would have given 5 stars, but somehow the atmosphere doesn't compare to the Wacken concert...the fans didn't seem to get into it as much...maybe the demographic was different, as I saw a lot of more mature folk in this, as opposed to at Wacken. But then again, maybe I need to get those 3D glasses...

B009H442DG|5.0|Some may say \\"This Christmas\\" with Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta is a cheesy take on Christmas music but it is a great CD filled with recordings of some of the greatest Holiday classsics ever and all the proceeds go to Olivia and John's personal favorite charities.<br /><br /> Barbra Streisand, James Taylor and Tony Bennett make appearances here and some of my favorites include \\"Silent Night', \\"Winter Wonderland\\", \\"The Christmas Song\\" and \\"Baby It's Cold Outside\\" although the latter is far superior to the Rod Stewart/Dolly Parton version.<br /><br /> Grab a cup of hot chocalate, decorate the tree and throw this CD on...it will put you in the Christmas mood as both Olivia and John sound thrilling and fantastic here.

B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I love the game other than the fact that you have to wait on energy but it force closes whenever I scroll through the crop list and when I try to open one of the tasks.  It also asks that I buy a barber shop which doesn't even exist.  Please fix!

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|An almost fitting conclusion to the story of Katniss Everdeen. While I thoroughly enjoyed the series, I found this to be the weakest of the books. The ending felt rushed. It felt like the author got tired of her characters and rushed the story to an end. Not that it matters, you'll read it anyway.
0307592731|3.0|I read this at the request of a friend who couldn't tell if it was fiction or nonfiction.  (I'd say heavily embellished personal essay).  As a life long backpacker (who has done part of the same trail as the author), I looked forward to reading it.  Few of the hiking parts rang true with me and her trail experiences seemed more to akin to spring break adventures than any realistic portrayal of life in the wilderness, particularly considering how ill prepared she was.  There was nothing individual or real about the narrator that lead me to care about her personal troubles before the hike, either.  It was all pretty generic.  I didn't understand how this book became popular and why it had so many good reviews until I saw that it was an Oprah pick.  If you like the Oprah kind of \\"poor me\\" books, you might like this.  If you want a real account of wilderness adventure or a thoughtful exploration of family dynamics, look elsewhere.
B005LAIHY0|2.0|I expected this movie to be really good but instead i got a half baked attempt at a good scifi movie which vaguely explains anything and theres a hundred plot holes throughout that leaves the entire movie feeling unresolved. This was a one time viewing. Some people might like this movie though if your into b movie, irregularly paced films you might like this.
6305428042|5.0|This was a great movie when it came out and has withstood the test of time as a movie to entertain and please the masses (at least the masses amused by old fashioned witches, talking cats, and spiting zombies).
B007SGLZP8|3.0|It was sort of fun to read.  I like John Grisham when I just want to relax without having to think too much. He's usually entertaining.  I'll have to say that this one was a little different from his other books.  The problem is that by the time I finished it, I felt like he was having me on--the whole thing was just so convoluted and improbable and hard to follow. AND he keeps twisting the plot like a circus contortionist. It was more like a fantasy, which is a little surprising coming from Grisham.  Maybe he's running out of ideas?
0785163174|5.0|Marvel has written yet another series that tests the boundaries of the Marvel Universe. It happened in the Civil War series when friends were pinned against each other over having to register their civilian identities with the government. Men and women were fighting against who they had been fighting beside for years, In Avengers vs. X-Men the entity known as the Phoenix is back and  the result of a battle against it sits allies against each other again, involving personal reasons and the fate of the world.<br />This is a captivating book with two sides of a fight that's difficult to choose between. I highly recommend for any Marvel Universe fan,
B00338QENI|2.0|This is an interesting story,  but I just couldn't finish it. By midway, I was flipping pages just to get to the end of a chapter. Lots of repetition involving the family going back and forth over their angst. I got the picture right off and didn't need the level of detail the author seems to think is important to the story.  The detail didn't add anything. It was as if Rebecca Skloot had a story worth telling, but tried to make what could have been a 50 page book into one stretching to over 400 pages.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|The second season was perhaps not quite as delightful as the first, but it was still very good and satisfying to watch, if just a tad more predictable. Julian Fellowes is one of England's most entertaining and humane writers. His characters, both servants and masters, are flesh-and-blood creations with their own very human virtues, vices, feelings, and needs.  The second season resolves some issues left hanging in the first season, and creates a few more issues for an eagerly awaited third season.  If you are a fan of &#34;Downton Abbey,&#34; do not overlook the film &#34;Gosford Park,&#34; the manor house mystery in which Fellowes collaborated with the late great director Robert Altman.  I also highly recommend his delightful novels, &#34;Snobs,&#34; and &#34;Past Imperfect.&#34;  I cannot recall reading a better opening paragraph than the one in the latter novel.
B00943SQCI|5.0|I'm a big fan of both Johnny Depp and Tim Burton but this is another star from the dynamic duo.  Depp is a fathomless actor with the ability to become any character he chooses.  He does a great job in a new twist on the old favorite daytime soap.  If you're a fan of the poor photography and bad acting in the old series, you might not like this.  This is a modern version with great production and acting.  It' not really a comedy, though it's marketed as one.  All the gags are in the trailer.  But it's a great movie that I really enjoyed.
B000KJZWMW|4.0|An oldie now, but definitely a good story, told well. Sad to say, MM2's vision of a dystopia where the landscape is bleak and fuel is hoarded and to die for seems all the more probable these days. Only hope we have Mad Max around when the chaos comes

B0035LJY6C|2.0|While the scenes and acting were good and were mostly faithful to the original TV show, the movie plodded along and at a couple points had us asking whether it was over yet.

1451638450|5.0|We knew she could write and this book certainly reinforces that.  Ivan has always been a sort of \\"behind Miles\\" character and we had not before been given such an in depth analysis of this now so interesting character.  I am sure I am not alone in wanting a second book about Ivan and his lovely wife.  A book with By as the main character could also be a great one, which is another relatively new character.  I am waiting to see what Ms. Bujold treats us to next.<br /><br />This book could be read as a standalone, although knowing more of the history helps understand a lot of side incidents. But the main character and the main action and most of the plot are totally unique and would make this book a good one even for those new to this series and writer. They would then want to read all about Miles too of course.<br /><br />This book has lots of action and imagination and intrigue and great characters to get attached to and worry about.  I would recommend this book to men, women and teens as a totally great escape into a well developed world unveiled by a great writer.
B0045HCJSK|5.0|One of the best of recent westerns with plenty of action and charismatic acting from the principal actors. John T. Chance (John Wayne) is sheriff of Rio Bravo in Texas and has a deputy, Dude (Dean Martin), who is well-known for spending much of his time under the influence of alcohol. Chance's other deputy, Stumpy, is characterfully played by Walter Brennan. The town is effectively under the control of rancher Nathan Burdette (John Russell) with the help of the gunslingers he has working for him. Burdette's brother Joe (Claude Akins) picks a fight with Dude in the saloon and kills a bystander who tries to intervene. Chance arrests Joe for murder but can't get a judge or marshal into the town to try him because of Burdette's effective blockade. The wagon supply-train master Pat Wheeler (Ward Bond), with gunslinger Colorado Ryan (Ricky Nelson) as guard, have to pass through a group of Burdette's men in order to be allowed into town - a situation that Chance cannot tolerate. There's not much more to the plot but the fascination of the film lies in the characters who appear in it. Near the end there is a haunting melody composed by Dmitri Tiomkin but arranged by Nelson Riddle for a solo trumpet, which indicates that a showdown with Burdette is imminent.

B004LWZWGA|3.0|Christopher Nolan's latest and last installment of his revamped Batman trilogy, The Dark Knight Rises, is arguably the film with the most heart of the trio. This is more of a cerebral film than its predecessors. You will not see as much of Batman as before, however you will see more Bruce Wayne. You will not see the level of gritty violence or drawn-out brawling that The Dark Knight. delivered. You will also, sadly, not see Heath Ledger. You will, however, see the Dark Knight rise.<br /><br />Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale or, as some websites like to call him, \\"BatBale\\") is a broken man, both mentally and physically. He is recovering from his injuries endured at the end of The Dark Knight, as well as his broken heart. When Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) takes him by surprise by robbing his \\"uncrackable\\" safe and stealing his mother's necklace, along with reports of Bane (Tom Hardy) causing some serious trouble in Gotham City, Bruce is inspired to once again don the mask and become the Batman.<br /><br />Alfred (Michael Caine) fears for Bruce, so he leaves Wayne Manor in an attempt to provide Bruce with some clarity. This act of tough love is immediately swallowed up in the simmering peril lurking quite literally beneath the city. Bane is about to rain more terror and brutality on the city of Gotham than we have seen it encounter thus far and, for the first time, Batman might not be enough to stop him.<br /><br />Hathaway makes an excellent Catwoman, and thankfully, because Nolan is a master of subtlety, she is never actually titled as such, nor is she dressed like a fool. She is quick, both in wit and fight, and she reinvents a character that seemed beyond saving after the crap-fest that was Halle Berry's Catwoman. Best of all, she is believable.<br /><br />Hardy's Bane is a magnetic villain. I never had much interest in the character, yet I found myself anticipating his next scene. A major theme in this film is that we should not let our emotions control us, particularly our anger. While Bruce Wayne fights his own stubborn will to accomplish this task, we can see why, like the Joker, Bane is the polar opposite of Batman. Although while the Joker may have had no other motive than to \\"watch the world burn\\", Bane's motivation is more rational and understandable. While we both loved Ledger's Joker and anticipated his demise, we find ourselves caught off-guard in that we can honestly sympathize with Bane.<br /><br />Gary Oldman is respectable once again as Commissioner Gordon, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, an actor whose work I would always gladly watch twice, was excellent as John Blake. Gordon-Levitt is an actor who rarely, if ever, lets me down. His presence in a film is almost a guarantee that it will not suck.<br /><br />Marion Cotillard was satisfying as Miranda, although I couldn't seem to separate her from her role alongside Gordon-Levitt in Inception. The female leads in these Batman films always fall flat for me. Keep an eye out for a cameo from a character we have seen in previous films who may or may not surprise you in presence alone, but who delivers one of the funnier lines of the film.<br /><br />Oldman and Gordon-Levitt (like Bale, Morgan Freeman, Hathaway, heck every actor in this film), never fail to capture your belief in their performances. These actors don't just act; they become the characters they play. This is appreciable when a film wants to transport you to a different world and actually takes you there.<br /><br />Some have complained that The Dark Knight Rises suffers from being stretched too thin, and that it did not need to be a two hour and forty-four minute film. I will argue that this film is akin to the television series \\"Mad Men\\": it simmers for a while at a slow boil, but when it finally comes to a head, you will not regret one minute of your time spent. Much of the film is spent sitting at the edge of a seat, knowing something explosive is coming yet unsure of when.<br /><br />One of the selling pointsfor me to see this film, as if I needed one, was that since I had not seen it on opening weekend, everyone I knew had already seen it and told me that the last few scenes made the movie. They were correct. I never thought I'd cry at a Batman film, and that is not only a testament to how solidly Nolan can build a foundation, but how he can also properly finish what he started. Nolan was able to finish his opus with the same levels of grace and closure that we have come to expect from such a master filmmaker.for me to see this film, as if I needed one, was that since I had not seen it on opening weekend, everyone I knew had already seen it and told me that the last few scenes made the movie.

B0094BB4TW|2.0|it doesnt really have a lot of pros.  it doesnt load past the first page for the news feed and profiles.  it looks ok and loads pictures fast but prefer to just use the web browser.  i would like to see some updates and improvements to have it work as well as the iphone app.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|First, let's set things straight - despite the title, this is no story of sheep.  Perhaps the greatest failing of this book series is the unassuming name which almost drove me away from it.  Don't make that mistake.<br /><br />Wool is easily one of the most compelling stories I have read in recent memory.  It's something that almost defies description, despite borrowing heavily from other tropes and themes.  Despite this, Howey manages to make something truly amazing.  A piece of post-apocalyptic narrative that just makes sense and draws you into the books.  Without going overboard, Howey delivers a narrative that is both gripping on the surface and still manages to carry depth in meaning and philosophy without being either needlessly obtuse nor boorishly brash.  It simply percolates up from the deepest mechanisms of the story in fresh pieces that can catch you by surprise.<br /><br />I wouldn't call Wool a perfect narrative, to be fair - it has stumbling blocks here and there.  Minor continuity errors or editing misses.  What makes these stand out is how few they are in relation to the overall size and scope of the work.<br /><br />If anything else needs to be said about Wool, I will say this - it is undervalued.  I wouldn't stack it next to the literary greats easily, but it certainly outshines your typical offering and is certainly of greater impact than its price might suggest.<br /><br />If you are a fan of post-apocalyptic narrative; of socio-political fiction; of sociological psychology; or a fan of Fallout - do not pass this (these) book(s) up.
B00005QFE5|5.0|Many years ago I watched \\"Red Sorgum\\" and \\"Farewell my concubine\\". More recently, one late night I came accross \\"The Road Home\\" in cable and fell in love all over again with Zhang's particular way of telling stories. I guess perhaps what defines Mr. Zhang's powerful cinematic discourse is the irresistible simplicity of it, and the  marvelous way he portrays the complex canvas of his chinese heritage by way of simple characters, ancient traditions and the overwhelming subtlety of a millenary culture. \\"The Road Home\\" is a moving story involving a son, a deceased father, and an aging grieving mother with what seems to be, a futile posthumous wish to honor the memory of her late husband. Mr. Zhang's slowly reveals feelings and emotional connections among all the characters and the very essence of life, tradition and family that has brought them to their present situation flourishes. And the audience is hopelessly trapped in the beautiful simplicity of an eternal storyline. With my purchase of \\"The Road Home\\" in DVD I feel I have added yet another of Mr. Zhang's gems to my movie collection.
0375805613|5.0|This book was one of my favorites when I was little and now my son I am enjoy it. Its a silly story about turning pages to get to the monster but it is a fun read.
B007NG93CK|4.0|As always a very entertaining and descriptive write. Kathy Reichs is one of my all time favorites. She has a way of turning her characters into real people.
B003VXRD4E|5.0|I loved this series. Peggoty was just as I imagined her to be. Having purchased this I am sure I will watch it again and again!
B00633W614|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book. Was sorry to see it end because the 3rd in the trilogy is not out until May 2013. This is my first exploration of Jeffery Archer and now I want to read more of his work.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book is seriously amazing. I was sucked into the story and it held on and didnt let me go till the very end. Even then I reread it the next day. Great read, would totally recommend it.

B007TXN4TK|3.0|Pretty fun, but I won't be buying the full version (and not just because I'm being cheap). I'm playing on Kindle Fire and the screen seems large enough. I also have twiggy banana hands so the slenderness of the keys isn't much of a concern. The biggest issue is I can't press more than two keys at a time and some tunes require more, so you get penalized for it. Apart from that I like this free version, even if they put on tunes you can't play to entice you to buy the full version.

0812984412|4.0|The book consists of six totally different stories--different in time, place, dialect, format, and with (more or less) totally different characters. There is, for example, the personal diary of an American notary traveling across the South Pacific in the mid-1800s, as well as the interview with a genetically-engineered clone fast-food waitress in a future dystopian Korea as she awaits the death penalty for her alleged crimes. Aren't those two things in one book by themselves enough to spark anyone's curiosity? Worked for me!<br /><br />But I don't think the appeal of this book is as wide as it may seem.<br /><br />Expecting all the stories to blend together in some cool, genius fashion, or at least for one to conclude rather naturally into the next, I was surprised at the way one story would cut off abruptly, while the next provided only a few vague allusions to the tale which had so recently immersed me in nearly overwhelming detail. And, as each section was so radically different in topic and style, some of the stories were naturally more interesting to me than others--although they were all engaging enough to keep me turning pages. (That's what really gets me. The six stories are SO different! It's hard to imagine they were written by a single author, because it's like he took on four or five different genres, and he did them all really well.)<br /><br />So on the one hand, you can consider this book quite simply as six short stories. Just ignore the fact that they're organized into a mirror format, and that the author has sewn in a few threads of continuity here and there. Those are gimmicks to justify his collection of stories as a single book, that's all. Maybe he had a lot of half-finished projects on his computer and decided to slap them together one day, and that's how Cloud Atlas was born. Why not? So if you like well-written short stories of various genres, and won't expect them all to make sense together, this book may appeal to you.<br /><br />But that wouldn't be the point, would it?<br /><br />So on the OTHER hand, you can open yourself up to consider the deeper themes suggested by Cloud Atlas. Is the uniquely-juxtaposed sum more significant than its parts? What is that significance?<br /><br />Well, it's not as though some grand, unifying meta-narrative materialized from within, not at any point during the reading process. For me, it was precisely the subtlety of the themes and connections in Cloud Atlas that made it linger so in my mind. And as it has lingered, I've come to appreciate the book more and more. It really is helpful to imagine the novel as a musical composition (as the book itself not-even-subtly encourages us to do)--we don't expect comprehensive answers to all our \\"whys\\" and \\"hows\\" from a piece of music, but rather connect to it emotionally, stepping away from its performance with an almost incommunicable understanding of the composer's passion and impetus, an understanding which cannot be reduced to the clarinet solo alone, even if that was our favorite part.<br /><br />This book can cause you to reflect on power and helplessness, human nature and society, time and reality.<br /><br />When you step back and look at our human existence, it seems so cruel, chaotic and meaningless; individuals and their fights seem trivial amidst the transience of all things. But if you step a little closer, you will see subtle connections between everything and everyone. The stories we read, the things we believe in, and the inherent indefatigable nature of humanity--these reach beyond our mere chapters of existence to compose a great work, both of and beyond our time, if not our imaginations as well. That is not just the reality in Cloud Atlas--that is our reality. And it was as if my reading the novel were a part of the novel itself. Maybe not a very interesting part, but, hey, that's how it goes.<br /><br />I would recommend this book only to people who enjoy both conventional AND unconventional fiction. For maximum reading pleasure, one must open oneself up to the subtle nature of this book. It's not the sort of postmodern fiction that will have your mind doing backflips and questioning \\"WAS THAT REAL?\\" all the way through. It's more dry and straightforward than that. But it's not so straightforward that you should take its odder elements at face value. I think that would leave you bitterly disappointed.aximum reading pleasure, one must open oneself up to the subtle nature of this book.

B009VB97EY|1.0|Aside from some cute guys pulling of some cool dance moves, there was nothing enjoyable about this movie. A cast of dysfunctional characters, drugs, and random disgusting sex is not my idea of a fun time. Clearly, this movie was made BY men who only THINK they know what women want. Take the costumes for example: just because guys think girls in thongs are hot, doesn't mean the reverse is true.<br /><br />Sadly, the men who made this movie think women are as obsessed with their p-e-n-i-s-e-s as they are. Jiggling and grabbing their junk made up most of the dance moves that needed to wow us gals.<br /><br />With all the irresponsible drugs and sex, I kept thinking \\"HIV, hepatitis, herpes alert!.\\" Simply put: it was disgusting.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|im 9 years old and it was very fun i would buy this game if i where  you. nothing happend that made me mad .
B009VSW15Y|1.0|Purchased this app and during download was told it was corrupted and unable to be downloaded to my device. Wouldn't have been bad but it charged my account for the purchase. What a rip-off!!!! Apps should be tested by the kindle makers for accesibility issues.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|i prefer to read the story first and then see it on screen.  read this straight thru and its great.  to often the movie leaves out things i think are important or they portray people in ways that i am surprised at.  But that is part of the fun in seeing how others interpret.  But i also would rather pay writers and publishers than actors.....
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game. I just wish I could get more energy. I certainly wont pay tor it. however,  it is a really fun game. :)
3442217784|5.0|Great read, and very enlightening...borrowed the book from a good friend and finally bought it myself! It's a great read for kids teens and adults alike.
0345803493|2.0|This work has a sophomoric plot and repetitive writing. The erotic S&M episodes soon became boring, just like all pornography.
B0090X4HES|5.0|Let me start off by saying I usually don't buy albums I always download them for free, however this was a must buy. I've been a fan since his mixtape \\"Overly Dedicated\\". Kendrick Lamar has done what seems like no other main stream rapper has done in a while and that is KEEP IT REAL. The album's concept narrates a teenage Kendrick borrowing his mother's van to visit a girl named Sherane and experiencing the Compton gang lifestyle with his friends, then entering reality after the death of a friend during a shoot-out. Sometimes I don't know whether im watching a movie or listening to an album its that deep. Definitely has my vote for album of the year.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|this is a fun yet challenging game. great if you have a couple minutes to spare or want to take more time. warning - time goes by really fast when you are absorbed in it.
B0084I9QI2|5.0|I have no complaints I was happy how fast it came and the care to to to to to to
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is great and the game you would love to play if you are up for a challenge and speed.
B00846REIS|3.0|I am not honestly much a a reader, however I read the fifty shades triligy in 2 weeks and then heard that the crossfire series was just as good.  I do not think that is just as good but it kept me interested enough for me to be anticipating the 3rd book coming out. I definately thought fifty shades was a better book, but I would still recommend reading this book if you like fifty shades. And in my mind Christian Grey is better looking.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This book was well written and tied up the hunger games trilogy nicely. With that said this was definitely a slower read than the other two books which I inhaled but a must read to complete the series.
B0060AY6FO|3.0|Not bad but dragged on a bit. I much prefer P. D. James usual style.  Interesting view of Jane Austen's world
B005PK553C|4.0|Really liked the build up of characters... This show is different than usual horror in that it focuses on  many different stories of each character.  Well done!
0547884591|5.0|I preordered Tim Ferriss' \\"Four Hour Chef.\\" I was looking forward to the read. I'll confess--as much of a motivational rock star as Tim is, I thought I had him beat in the kitchen. Still, I was curious--Tim's claims to use cooking as a vehicle for teaching about life peaked my curiosity.  Everything he's put out has been well worth my time thus far, so even if it was for the pedagogy alone, I was in.<br /><br />I was humbled on all accounts.<br /><br />This book exceeds expectations in so many ways--First, its sheer size. I know they say that size doesn't matter, but in this case, it does. Tim has included information on every culinary style and method to which I've been exposed, and several I'm not sure I wish to be. It's a veritable compendium of all things culinary, from making a simple but elegant salad to dressing a deer. And when I say \\"dressing\\" I'm not talking about a fashion show here--Tim gets down and dirty hunting his own dinner.<br /><br />Tim's helpful hints include opening a wine bottle using a shoe--a position I've never been in before, but thanks in part to Tim's expert diagrams and illustrations, it's something I can add with pride to my skill-set.<br /><br />This might be the only R rated cookbook I've ever read--It's not one I'll hand over to my five-year old while we cook together and bond; it's adult, and it's honest--food is sensual and meat doesn't grow at the grocery store.<br /><br />In fact, that's one of the themes I most enjoyed about this book--the premise that we are at a critical junction in our food production in history. As large-scale industry swallows up small farms, we further endanger our culinary biodiversity.  Tim's goal is for us to maintain healthy, well-sourced foods and to be educated about them. He started this journey at Slow Food movement founder Alice Waters' Chez Panisse, and ended it with a culinary tour of the world.<br /><br /> \\"Four Hour Chef\\" is well organized with detailed sections ranging from basic skills andequipment to techniques of the pros. Tim includes a chefography and research bibliography, and has a helpful reference section in the end. There are hundreds of world-renown chefs in \\"Four Hour Chef,\\" many of whom Tim has traveled to meet. He has addressed many culinary styles: fresh local food chefs, the French greats, gastronomes and even field chefs. He has also included a section about the science behind it all.<br /><br />I expected to learn a lot about the art of learning but found myself delighted with Tim's ability to become a \\"master chef\\" in short order and to spin tales that made me want to be become better myself.  He proved once again that \\"material beats method\\" and that we truly can master anything.<br /><br />Well done, Tim.  And I'm not talking about the steak.
B009FZFONO|5.0|We do not have cable, but we love watching the Walking Dead. We wanted to get Hulu, but they didn't have this show. So I was really happy to find out that Amazon played the current season episodes and it is a trusted site where I'm not afraid to get some type of computer virus from downloading these shows. This is such an easy and convenient way to watch each episode. The screen shows nice clear vivid pictures.  The show is uninterrupted, so there are no long commercials which we are super happy about. You can also go back and watch the previous episodes that you had already purchased.
B000002LEE|5.0|I finally got tired of my original CD skipping all the time so I replaced it with a new copy. When this release came out it was ground breaking and no one knew what Perry had in store for us down the road. Everything from more Jane's Addiction releases to the lifechanging Lalopolooza music festival. Jane Say's is the obvious go to song as it took over College Radio and Alternative Rock stations at the time. Mountain Song is by far my favorite song and it just RIPS. Only word I could think of to describe it. Dave Navarro was just coming into his own stye and this is a great beginningto get to know him. This is now my 3rd copy of Nothing's Shocking. I wore the cassette out within month's. I now have a clean CD and am very happy to re-charge my soul listening to this classic.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The best book in the Hunger games Trilogy. I literally could not put this book down until I finished it.... Which was Two days later. :-)

B005LAIHZY|5.0|Cool movie, I saw it in 3D, but I want to know what kind of monitors the computer animators were using. Does anybody know? Really. Does anybody know?
B007N8RULO|5.0|Free App that is really free and fun to play nice to be able to without paying finally commercials not bad only play between games not bothersome enjoy
B002ZB26AO|5.0|Heartbreaking and eye opening account of the lives of the North Korean people. Cannot believe they are still in this situation after all these years!
B000002LIX|4.0|A good follow up to a classic release, &#34;Nothing's Shocking&#34;. Nothing really jumps out at you lke Mountain Song or Jane Say's. The Cd has some great highlights. Been Caught Stealing was a huge hit on College and Alternative Rock stations and my favorite track is #4 - &#34;Obvious&#34;. Classic Jane's Addiction. The beat the sophmore curse by delivering a good follow up. Dave Navaro ireally fitting into the groove eventually to move on to bigger things thenback with Jane's. I gave it a 4 instea f of a 5 beacuase ne or two songs couldhave been re0arranged better. I won;t list them and let you make up your own mind. All in all, it's a great addition to your Jane's collection. My dog atill barks at eh walls when I play, &#34;Been Caught Stealing&#34;. Worth the price of the CD alone to have such entertainment. Cheers and Enjoy!

B004MC8CA2|3.0|Great Bible.  Easy to navigate. The only drawback is not being able to access when offline. Would have been nice to know before downloading.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Played game on my Kindle Fire with no problems but it does take a long time to load.  Well worth the wait.  Great storyline, lots of puzzles that make you use your sleuthing abilities.  Hidden objects are not super easy and there is a zoom function that is helpful.  When you get stuck the strategy guide is on the menu so no need to go online for help or a walkthrough.  All in all a well written, interesting and entertaining game that is worth $2.99!  I hope Alawar does a &quot;Stray Souls&quot; sequel.  Get this game and you won't be disappointed.  Hours of captivating play for those who love HO games with a purpose and good story.
1904920233|5.0|Have been very pleased with this cookbook. Great sauce recipes in addition to everything else. Favorite recipe is salmon hot pot - easy to prepare, bakes in the oven, the only recipe in the book not from the restaurant. It alone has been worth the price.

B004HD6866|4.0|I found this ebook brings alive the old story with colour and flare. I don't have any dislikes and in future, perhaps, hope to see schools using this product.
B001EBYM8A|5.0|I'm not a die-hard action thriller fan. I appreciate mysteries much more. But I have to say I was quite impressed by this movie. I didn't watch it when it was first released (remember - I don't like action movies). I happened to catch part of it on television this weekend, and I rushed to Amazon to watch it from beginning to end. Great action, great (but sometimes over the top) effects, great drama, and lots of thrills.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|First book I read by Elizabeth Haynes.  Not at all what I expected, but was very pleased when I got into it.  Kept you wondering what was going to happen next, and it was always a surprise.  This is a great read.

B006LEHOL2|2.0|I am truly sorry that I can't like this. I think Sinead is enormously talented,and what's more, I happen to agree with many of her political and social views (including those that had gotten her booed by thousands). But this collection just doesn't do it for me. There are some lovely moments - 4th & Vine is so simple yet terrific, and it makes you want to get up and dance. Reason With Me is a gorgeous and moving song, although I have an issue with Sinead's apparent premise that you can save a junkie by reasoning with him/her - has she never met one? But shortly after that song I found my attention wandering. The songs are all pretty much the same deal: very intimate confessions and rants that sound equally goofy; musically, there's not even a pretence of trying to develop a melody or an overall structure. Most of it sounds like an on-the-spot improvisation, with just enough two-chord strumming to allow for a sort of vaguely sung monologue that might as well be spoken word. The last song is emblematic of all of this and also dubs as a rather simplistic sermon (basically: material goods and fame don't really make you an important person, and when judgment day comes you'll get your comeuppance and you'll see just who's important). If that's as much as you need from religion, good for you, but I found myself snoring by that point.<br />Sinead has always chronicled her states of mind and her private life in her music, so, depending on where her thoughts and her experiences take her, we might expect either even worse than this or something absolutely sublime. I definitely don't think she's run out of talent, she has too much of it.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Great story and the players are divine. My husband and I both enjoy the theme and the story development...can't wait until next season is released. Highly recommended.

B009HV2JT8|3.0|Although curious about how a man could justify developing a movie concerning a vampire and one of our Greatest Leaders I chose to watch the movie anyway. The acting and script were great. Over all this the movie was worth watching. The plot was extraordinary, exciting and interesting. I would encourage anyone enjoying Vampire movies and history to rent via Amazon Prime.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|I am loving this game especially with the harder difficulty. The game has great interactive puzzles and awsome voice overs.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This is such a pleasant surprise. My husband and I decided to check it out, even though we have no children, and were both moved by the story and the art. This is a beautiful piece of work Highly recommended.
0525952926|5.0|All I can say is I can hardly wait for the third book.  bring it out soon Ken.  Excellent story and well written.
B007V65R54|4.0|Provides an insight into how we each view and process the data that bombard us. A little more math on Bayesian analysis would have been OK, an occasional integral, even.
B002EEP3NO|4.0|This is a Xmas present for my son so haven't started building it yet but it arrived a day earlier than projected so very happy about that!
B009E3EXMU|5.0|I received the item right on time, Thanksgiving eve. We got pizza and watched it on the big screen as loud as possible.<br />Oh my God, what a great production!<br />The 2 cd and 2 dvd box set is a very nice package with interesting liner notes from the band.<br />Thank you Amazon.<br />Thank you Led Zeppelin!!!
B002JVWR4U|5.0|A fantastic continuation (and an unfortunate ending) to one of the most original television shows ever written. I only wish there was another season to purchase.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|this fun filled action packed adventure is full of great detail and structure. best game yet is all I have to say about it. great!
B0034G4P4Y|5.0|I read the Tin Tin books as a child in the '50's and watched the animated versions of a few of his tales in the '70's.  I truly enjoyed this version of our plucky hero's exploits.  Well done production and presentation.  The film in the theatre was in 3D, which is distracting.  In normal 2D on the TV, it's fine.
B009IAIBAE|5.0|BLINK82 IS NOT BETTER THAN IRON MAIDEN AND PRIEST COMBINED!! COUNT THE ALBUMS SOLD AND COUNTRIES TRAVELED TO. NOT MUCH DEMAND DEMAND FOR STINK82 OUTSIDE OF THEIR HOMETOWN. WHAT A JOKE!
B00A6N8F4Y|5.0|I wasn't going to review until I saw the low rating. I thought this movie was great and definitely worth watching. I should say that I don't care about directors whatsoever, I don't watch a movie because I like the director and I don't think it's fair to judge a movie based on the director. I'm just a regular moviegoer and this one did not disappoint. It was suspenseful, the acting was well done and I thought the ending was perfect. I definitely recommend this if you liked the previews.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|pushing coins to deliver prizes to the slot to get more coins to get more prides to get more coins to get more funfunfun!
B007SGLZP8|2.0|the first part of the book was great. just what i always expect from John Grisham.  I told all my friends to read it BUIT<br />then it became ridiculous straight thru to the end.  I only wish I could have returned it.. It made no sense at all.
0446580848|5.0|Excellent book.  Would recommend Nelson DeMille as an author to read any day.  I don't feel that he mass produces (the way Stuart Woods and others do) his books and they are very enjoyable.
B0055X6TVQ|5.0|Ken Follett is at his best with this start to the century trilogy.  Like &#34;Pillars of the Earth&#34; and &#34;World Without End&#34;,  Ken snares our interest from the very first page until the last.  Your experience will be; &#34;dang, when does the next book come out.&#34;  And thankfully, &#34;Winter of the World&#34; is out.  Now the point of novel reading life is centered on the third and final book in the series. Hurry up Ken, I'm waiting!
B007EE4XKI|5.0|Ahhhhhhh it was a great addition to the story I love the ending and so will many others. I can't wait to read the next one to see what happens. David Mack is one of the best star trek Writers.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|I think some people are overly critical of this movie. Yes, it's not a sophisticated, nuanced art film.<br />Yet the emotional content was there and the story was very compelling. I was actually pleasantly surprised by the script which Sylvester Stallone co-wrote.<br />The scenes of the legendary Chuck Norris are delightful. I also got a kick out of Gunnar, Dolph Lundgren's character, a somewhat unbalanced, frankensteinish character with an affinity for larger knives.<br />The Expendables 2 is a solid, fun action movie with compelling emotional content to drive the story and give a little meaning to all the crazy gun blasting mayhem.
B00701L5XS|5.0|A one of a kind (to my knowledge) app for learning knots. Unfortunately, the one who needs it, my Boy Scout son, doesn't have (by my choice) a phone to use it well!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I must say I did not think this game would be very good at first, but the great voice acting, story line and how well the game is made made me change my mind very quickly.
1933952806|5.0|It's extremely SIMPLE: Put the Owner's Manual in the Recycle Bin & BUY this Book period; you will NEVER regret it.  Trust me.  I told you it was simple.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|I must have been lucky. No warped records. No skips. No off center labels. No bent corners. No damage to LP jackets or book. No distortion. I pre-ordered this on November 7 and recieved it on the 13th (the release date}. The set was properly packaged with no damage what so ever. Not even a scuff mark. My equipment is a Technics SL 1210MK2 turntable, Grado phono cartridge, Sony reciever, Sony pre-amp, and Sony tower speakers{2 tower and 2 mid size}. I spent the last 9 days trying to find any problems that many others have found, especially with Abby Road, and did not find any. Of course you will hear a few pops and ticks here and there, this is vinyl not compact disc. If you don't want to hear any pops or ticks, listen to your CDs. I'll keep spinning my vinyl. This is a great box set.
1401307450|5.0|No matter how awesome you think you are, you have come nowhere near the sheer volume of drugs which Anthony Kiedis has consumed, nor have you had as much incredible sex with as many spectacular women. That, roughly speaking, is the theme of Kiedis’ autobiography and, if even half of what he says is true, it’s hard to imagine that anyone will ever be able to trump him in either endeavour.<br /><br />For those who do not know, Anthony Kiedis is the lead singer of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, a merry band of funksters who have over the course of a career spanning two decades broken down a startling number of musical barriers in the mainstream and produced some fantastic music along the way.<br /><br />The most damning indictment of the book is that there is literally no narrative structure here; Kiedis does not impose any sort of dramatic development on his story, so unless one is familiar with the outlines of Chili Pepper history, this is just one really, really, really long picaresque. And I use that word in its strongest pejorative sense: this is 465 pages of “this happened; then this happened; then this happened; then this happened; then this happened; then this happened; then this happened; then this happened; then this happened; oh, and then this happened; did I mention that this happened? No? Anyways, then this happened; then this happened…” and on and on seemingly ad infinitum.<br /><br />Which is too bad: the Chili Peppers’ story could make for fascinating reading. They let their freak flag fly and eventually the music-buying public wandered over, trying to figure out what these guys were up to. They never really compromised their music, with even their poppiest tunes (except for the execrable One Hot Minute) slanted just slightly off-kilter to what the rest of the mainstream was doing. And the personalities in the band are, to put it mildly, eccentric: Kiedis is the beautiful, rapping, flowing, sex god, drug addict, front man; bassist Flea is the manic musician, the kind of guy who would probably be terribly unsettling to sit beside on the subway, but who, by all accounts, has a heart of gold; current (and former… it’s a long story) guitarist John Frusciante is a drug-damaged artiste; and Chad Smith, the drummer (of course) is the odd one out, the guy who doesn’t seem to fit in so well. Very little of this comes through in Scar Tissue; for example, Smith, who has been drumming for the band for more than fifteen years is barely mentioned, and almost no interactions between Kiedis and Smith are recounted, other than a drunken near-brawl in a hotel.nic musician, the kind of guy who would probably be terribly unsettling to sit beside on the subway, but who, by all accounts, has a heart of gold; current (and former… it’s a long story) guitarist John Frusciante is a drug-damaged artiste; and Chad Smith, the drummer (of course) is the odd one out, the guy who doesn’t seem to fit in so well.

B0060AY6FO|3.0|I was a bit disappointed. James started well with a resonable pastiche of Jane Austin's style but didn't/couldn't maintain it. Having said that, I'm not an Austinite so enjoyed the James who-dunnit-it better than Austin's silly girls simpering about potential husbands.
B008NABUU8|4.0|More interesting than other games in the category. Also more difficult. It takes some effort, thought, and know how to finish all levels. I haven't done it myself, but I enjoy the ride - good 20 minute diversion side trips.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|it crashes when cycle through items in store. please fix so can progress! otherwise loved it! not sure if its the level I'm at or it downloaded an update recently...
B004JMY312|5.0|I LOVE this movie when I first saw it and still love to watch it years later! Almost every Halloween I watch this movie. Its just good family friendly fun.
0743497465|3.0|A fun quick suspense again by Dan Brown. However, his first work is a bit too unbelievable to make it a great suspense like Angels and Demons. As usual the plot all hints strongly towards one character as the culprit behind the conspiracy, but then abruptly shifts in a surprise coup to a different character (the scheme behind all of his books). In this instance, however, the shift was too unbelievable and even a bit contradictory.
B001RNO7CQ|5.0|the shoe fits right and feels good. nothing could be better than that. it is all i can ask for.
B000008HZB|5.0|This recording followed the Traveling Wilburys with Jeff Lynne's production, as he played and sang with the likes of Bob Dylan, George Harrison and Tom Petty. Jeff's taste in re-recording two old standards tunes was such a cool twist in this solo, ELO-like recording. This album, though, is uniquely \\"Jeff\\". There's a rich variety of styles on this disc (the vinyl is so much warmer, BTW). George Harrison's guitar and background vocals bring a smoothness to the performances that only a Beatle could bring. So, when I picked up Jeff Lynne's latest 2 releases, \\"Mr. Blue Sky...\\" and \\"Long Wave\\" (October 2012), I was reeeealy happy to see an insert fall out of each one! They announced the upcoming CD releases of several remasters: \\"Armchair Theatre\\", \\"Zoom\\", and a new release of the Zoom Tour DVD audio tracks with bonus songs. What I would love to discover here is anyone who may be familiar with the dates of these releases. Armchair Theatre is including bonus tracks, too!<br /><br />UPDATE: Hello, how are you? Have you been alright, through all those lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely nights? Maybe too lonely...could have had maybe just one more friend to throw in an outsider's take on this upcoming re-release.<br /><br />Jeff Lynne, the only thing missing from your solo flight these days (2013) is objectivity! Don't you know that on this St. Patrick's Day there's a pot 'o gold waiting for you here if you simply had me as your manager?<br /><br />I'm being silly, but I mean to tell you that I would have suggested this: the kind of bonus track(s) that would really be a fan's delight would be some of those alternate mixes from Zoom found on the promo CD of Zoom, in addition to the two bonus tracks offered on this newest release. And one of these bonus tracks belong on the \\"Live\\" CD anyway! Sheesh!<br /><br />Bonus tracks on most re-releases are usually good for one, two, maybe three plays if they're of any quality. (Of course, if they were of any good structure they probably would have been on some regular release, right?). But here on the promo version you have some of the same great songs found on Zoom that could have been placed alongside the final, and in some cases, better mixes.<br /><br />\\"Alright\\" is one of several exceptions where the promo mix is much more interesting, and maybe a bit less commercial, than the final mix. I'm just sorry we missed out on what could have been an interesting addition and insight (!) into a nuanced variation. I know. I have the promo disc and absolutely love it each time I spin it. Thing is, I love BOTH versions. And that is a tribute to how well structured Jeff Lynne recordings are. So, for that, Jeff, I thank you.<br /><br />But, you know, here was a chance.....d have been on some regular release, right?).

B002GIBVV6|5.0|I recommend this to parents (all ages friendly) a wonderful story that transforms a young girl's sad life into one filled with wonder & love. Kind of magical!
B009O2XY12|4.0|help...my game just stopped working  I've tried reinstalling and it still doesn't work. its a fun game when its working
B007GCY8FS|5.0|A little slow for Reacher. He does not even slug anyone for the first two thirds of the book. A little more action and less cererabal would be appreciated. Still I will give it 5 stars. Well worth the read
B00A77II0U|5.0|This game is very fun.Its spooky and a great game.My mom had it on her computer and I could not stop playing it. Now they have it on the kindle and its awesome.
B009GESJH2|5.0|I know some don't like it but if you are a TRUE Kid Rock fan, don't worry about the negative reviews, you WILL like it. As with most of his music, I reserve judgement until I have listened to the entire CD several times. Too many people listen one time and write a bad review or make negative comments, then if you ask those same people a month from now, they change their tune. Kid Rock's music grows on you as you listen, the more you listen, the more you \\"get it\\" and the more you like it. Any true fan knows that. It's a great CD, just buy it :)
B009NQKPUW|1.0|You know how it feels when your watching something and nothing makes sense? If you have NOTHING else to do, watch it just for the effects. No story to make it worth your time
B003NS2T9G|5.0|I've long been a science fiction fan watching Star Trek, The X Files, and Dr. Who, being my favorites. Captain Jack, the main character in this show was first seen in Dr. Who, but don't expect this show to be another Dr. Who. This show is much more geared for an adult audience as it deals with less lighthearted adventures. There are still aliens, and all the excitement and I highly recommend this show for anyone who loves something a little different. I wish this show was still on the air.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I am so happy with the free version I am going to buy the paid one. I am happy to support small business.
B00447G29S|5.0|Let me start of by saying I had seen this movie in standard 2d before I saw it in 3D.  I generally liked the movie in 2D, the plot is slow at parts but the ending makes the move worth watching.  But I am not writing this review of the 2D version but for the 3D version.  Let me start off by saying WOW!  This is the best 3D movie I have seen yet on my home TV to date.  This movie is made for 3D.  I am not talking about the crappie made up 3D with the red and blue glasses, but the real thing.  Some of the parts that dragged in the 2D version were not meant to be seen in 2D, but in 3D.  There were times when I was watching the 3D I wanted to back up and watch the scene again but having seen the movie I also could not wait to get to some other upcoming scene that I knew would be great in 3D so I was torn between rewatching the scene or moving on.  The 3D train ride down the steep slope, the slide across the ice, and the North Pole scenes are breath takingly stunning with very little ghosting.  As I stated before I just wanted to watch and rewatch these scenes over and over again (good thing I own the Blu Ray, so I can now do just that).  This whole movie is taken to a new level with the 3D. The 3D in this movie should be studied by every film maker looking to make a spectacular 3D film.  If you previously bought this movie in the 2D version and your TV is a 3D, buy a copy in 3D.  It will be the best upgrade you bought all year.  If you don't have the movie yet, get the 3D version.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is absolutely  cool and i love it is  much i play it all the time and my mom loves it to not just me

B008TMA1LY|3.0|unless you spend real money you wont get anywhere in the game. and if you do spend money and you child accidently deletes or erases the game you have to start all over and wastedyour money but still fun
B0058W74UY|5.0|this is great so far.lets wait and see till next month. if it holds up to the challenge of travel n downloade by the bundle.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|This book was okay, but I kept feeling as if I had missed some important piece of the connections of the characters.  It's not a book that I would highly recommend to anyone.
B000QCSA54|5.0|As usual, Seth gives only one idea per book but clearly, shortly and insightfully. Can recommend when you don't have time and intention to read something bulky paged.
1439152802|5.0|This book kept my interest and I couldn't put it down.  Kate Morton writes great books that look back at another time with a mystery of some kind to them.  Love it !!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Everything is free, with an option to buy more coins to use. Collecting prizes for effects keeps it fun, as does the leveling system.
B008RNGCAO|2.0|Product was enjoyable until Azreal takes over for Batman. Was strange, graphic and Azreal was rude and full of stupidity. Too much was going on at once. In chapters with Joker, Scarecrow takes over. Two-Face doesn't express himself. The only good part is God of Fear. I do not recomend this book.
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|I was at about level 11 when the game cut me off. after that I could never use it again
B008VBYN80|5.0|I have so mend gams and this one is by fare the most fast and its so fun and amazing
B003G4W49C|5.0|Imaginative, and fun read. Looking forward to continuing with speaker for the dead. I happened to stumble across this book at random, and glad that I did... and I typically don't like reading books.
B004GJDQT8|4.0|I love this and actually order from my phone all the time. The one thing that would be cool is if you can add items to your wish list via a pic or from the phones browsers like the internet explorer toolbar plug in.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|After two years of daily playing with this, it still is challenging and fun.. Our ball has been dropped a few times (7yr olds playing), and has survived well..  Love this game...
B00886XQO0|5.0|This headset is very good and the leather makes your ears fell soaking wet. And they are.  This headset feels like a 100,000,000,000,000mm surround sound headset.  I feels like unlimited UAV but it doesn't show it on you minimap.  I can hear people all over the map running around.  But the mic sucks.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|New weapons, one that looks and sounds like Cartman from South Park. The game is a mix of the original product and Angry Birds Space. Lots of confusing angles and caroms when you're taking your shot. Some of the levels are relatively easy, some you work for hours then get a single star, oh my. Very challenging and this one has locked levels that require you to have a certain number of stars to get them open, good luck with that. Lots of fun and more difficult than any of the previous releases.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This young adult classic is a must read. While I was reading this book, I wasn't so amazed or captivated. But, by the end I definitely was. It's an easy read and worth your time.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|The soundtrack was exactly what I expected. The songs sounded great and my wife loved the CD. I would recommend this to anyone who liked pitch perfect.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I loved &#34;Winter of the World&#34;, and this storyline was equally interesting.  I hated to put it down!  Great sequel, can't wait for the final book!!
B002GHIPYI|4.0|Pretty comfortable, at first I thought it would be a bit too tight but it fits perfectly. The sound is good and almost all outside noise is blocked which is a bit uncomfortable if talking on skype (can't hear your own voice). Sometimes theres static in the headphones (which might not be its fault) but all in all, the headphones are okay
B007RRFUHM|5.0|If it wasn't for Gotye, then I wouldn't be able to find her. Her music speaks for itself. It takes R&B, gospel, pop, and alternative to a whole new level! As a music player myself, the connection of the sounds and lyrics really brings together a whole different meaning to music. It is something that is rarely heard of before. When I insert the CD in my car, the bass of Settle Down pretty much had sex with my sound system. I don't know how else I can explain this, but definitely pick her CD up!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Best thing about this calculator is its ability to work with large numbers. Hand held calculators show an error when you multiply chains of numbers that produce huge outputs. When you're working with ammunition reloading components, this type of math is necessary to determine pressure levels and bullet velocities and muzzle energy. An example of this is speed times speed times bullet weight in grains. Then divide the answer by 450230. I've never found a regular handheld calculator that can handle this constant used by reloaders.
0345803485|5.0|WOW, I'm sincerely astounded by some of the negative reviews... Yes, this book HAS possessed me and obsessed me, as it promised... It sucked me in, lured me in from the very first lines... I personally have devoured \\"50 shades of grey\\" in 3 days, my eyes red, I had to literally peel myself off it to go to sleep or to eat in between the readings... The main characters are developing so intriguingly, the mystery and darkness of Grey is oh so stimulating, the sex scenes are so well written it had made me explode several times... Can't wait to embark on reading the next 2 books of the trilogy. Laters, babies!<br />PS after finishing the trilogy, I can tell you that book #1 is the best of the 3, hands down!!! The build-up of attraction between the characters, the growing anticipation, curiosity, intensity is arousing and provocative, just like in the new relationships, when everything is new and fresh... So yes, the story of Christian and Ana is worth reading and contemplating, and even if you don't want to devote your time to all the trilogy right now, YOU WILL after this first book!!
B009AY04A8|2.0|L<br />Liked this game until it quit working. I made it go the part where the shipped sailed to go to the sacred island then then loading but it is stuck at that polnt. I would like to. finish this game if possible!!!<br />!
B008C1NUU6|5.0|To bad the Scorps retired. They were at their best when they did this cd. Here`s hoping for a reunion.
B009X00E18|4.0|I was sent this Marware microshell folio standing case for the Kindle Fire HD from Amazon Vine for and honest review. Here's my take on it.<br /><br />The stand folds nearly flat in its box but unfolds to position the Kindle Fire in landscape position for hands-free reading/viewing. The downside is that you can't use it with a cover if you want a transportable device. However, if you want to watch a video, the standup position is great. The Kindle is held in place by curved corners, while the back folds in on itself to hold the device at an angle. I watched The Blaze TV show while preparing dinner and it worked beautifully.
141659521X|5.0|Vince Flynn is one of my favorite author's, so I jumped at the chance to reorder his latest novel, The Last Man.  Although I have yet to read one of his books that I was not thoroughly entertained by, I enjoyed this one more than any of the others.<br /><br />Superstar CIA Clandestine Service Operative Mitch Rapp is back with his aging former trainer Stan Hurley and their boss, CIA Director Irene Kennedy along with numerous other interesting characters that one may need a score card to keep straight.  The author has obviously put a great deal of thought into this work and will have the reader pondering characters, motives and outcomes.<br /><br />The story begins with the penetration of a CIA safe house resulting in the kidnapping of the head of the CIA clandestine operations in Afghanistan--Joe Rickman--the murder of his body guards and the contents of the safe missing.  The identities CIA operatives and foreign spies are at risk of setting back CIA contacts and operations by at least a decade while Mitch is targeted by a contracted killer.<br /><br />In the meantime sources in the FBI, American Government and elsewhere threaten the security and structure of the CIA.<br /><br />Flynn keeps the reader intrigued with a complex well developed story and characters.  He takes the reader on an action packed ride with more twists and turns than usual in both foreign and domestic settings.<br /><br />This was my favorite Vince Flynn book to date and a thriller that I whole heartedly recommend.<br /><br />Enjoy!
0061715050|5.0|We read this to our 4 & 5 year old boys and they loved it! C.S Lewis was a great author!
B001BR5NN0|5.0|The Breakfast Club is a Classic!!! Great 80's movie! And the starting point for several great actors! You need this in your collection!
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|It may just be my device, but I had a lot of trouble trying to run this app. Nearly everytime I loaded it, my Kindle froze. As far as gameplay goes, it might be a little complicated for younger players (10 and under). My younger sister had trouble with some of the directions not being clear. If you are looking for games, she and I both enjoyed Paper Toss and it didn't freeze our devices. Skip this game and go download that.
B005LAIHZY|1.0|You won't believe it, as its from pixar. It's one of the worst movie I have ever seen. Looks like pixar people are very active writing and defending reviews on amazon. First thing first. its not a kids movie in any sense. My 5 year and 6 year were terrified watching it. The trailer is very misleading, the trailer is the best part of the movie. The movie is very dark (literally). Only at few places you can see green grasses and sunlight, otherwise its always night or evening (remember lords of the ring?). But the trailer shows you otherwise. Everyone is very uncultured in the movie. No body listen to anyone. Father do not listen to mom, mom don't listen to daughter, daughter don't listen to mom and so on. Even the guests do not listen to the host and quarrel all the time. So nobody talks to anyone, they just do what they want and so everyone is brave in this movie. Showing a$$ , showing cleavage are part of the humor so be warned if you are showing it to children.<br />There is no bravery (it does not connect with the story), no suspense, and no story. I can't believe someone in pixar approved this two step storyline. Marvel atleast write some story for their characters.<br /><br />You may be tempted to watch a pixar animation, but I am warning you. The only thing good about this movie is Merida's red hair.
B003QS9WIE|5.0|Love  this movie.  I could watch it many times - not typical for me - a classic/keeper for the DVD collection.  Great acting by Bale and Jackman - competitive rivalry, love, and action. Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson are great also.
B001G9FFM2|5.0|This collection is fantastic and Includes 2 bonus tracks of classic tracks &#34;Hallowed be thy name&#34; by Iron Maiden and Battery&#34; by Metallica. In addtion, the DVD features are fantastic with songs from 4 shows total including The 10th anniversary show for the release of &#34;Burn my eyes&#34;
B0070Y46UY|4.0|If you can make it to chapter 37, it starts to get really good. The ending is EXCELLENT. Up until chapter 37, you really have to skip ALOT. Once they get in the liferaft, it gets much better. Still have to skip some of the descriptions as it goes on for pages, but I'm really glad I read it before  seeing the movie
B009HV2JT8|5.0|Creepy movie with stellar special effects!  Good acting.  Decent plot.  somewhat scary. I missed it in the theaters and glad it is available to stream.

B009E3EWPI|5.0|On Dec. 10, 2007, Led Zeppelin reunited---with late drummer John Bonham's son Jason stepping in for his Dad---for a very special one-off concert at the 02 Arena in London in honor of the late great head of Atlantic Records, Ahmet Ertegun, who was a strong father figure to the band. Only 16,000 super-lucky fans were able to get tickets out of the millions who applied. By all accounts, Zeppelin's comeback concert was a smashing success, with the band at the top of their game, and a truly magnificent chapter in rock history. Thank God then that the Led Zeppelin reunion show was filmed & recorded....but it went unreleased for 5 years.<br /><br />But now, in 2012, here it is at last: Led Zeppelin's \\"Celebration Day\\". Having just finished watching the DVD of the concert, I was absolutely blown away by how fantastic Robert Plant, Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones and Jason Bonham were in this show. The band are pure rock 'n'roll thunder, working together like a four-headed rock beast. The band blast through a 16-song, 2 hour set that is nothing short of spellbinding. From the opener \\"Good Times Bad Times\\" to the final encore of \\"Rock And Roll\\", Zeppelin are simply on fire. Plant's voice may not be *as* strong as it once was in his Zeppelin heyday, but the man can still belt it out with gusto, and he can still fire off some surprisingly strong high notes (as he does in \\"Kashmir\\", to name one example). Jimmy Page's hair may now be pure white, but he is still a phenomenal rock guitarist (and you will be cheering him on when he finally pulls out the violin bow!). John Paul Jones remains a pure powerhouse on bass and keyboards, and Jason Bonham makes his father John proud by channeling his late dad with sensational drumming prowess and skill. Like his dad, Jason can hit those drums *really hard*! Somewhere, John is smiling down on his son.<br /><br />Like many other Led Zeppelin fans, I too wish the band would do a full-on reunion tour and play more shows....but I ain't gonna hold mybreath for it. The three veteran Zeppelin men are older now and well into their 60's (with Page pushing towards 70 at the time I write this), Plant still sings great (as evidenced by this 2007 concert) but nonetheless can't *quite* sing as phenomenally as he once did (which may explain why the band did not perform \\"The Immigrant Song\\"---I'm not sure Plant can do that siren battle cry on the song anymore), and they don't really *need* to do anything else, the band's place in rock history being more than secure. And let's face it: this 02 Arena concert is SO good, how can Zeppelin ever top it? All of this is probably why a lengthy Zeppelin reunion tour is unlikely to ever be in the cards. Still...I'd love to be proven wrong!<br /><br />If \\"Celebration Day\\" really is Led Zeppelin's last stand, then they have gone out on top of the world. Let's just be grateful then that they recorded the show, and are letting us, the fans, finally get our hands on it. What a wonderful gift to Led Zeppelin fans everywhere this reunion concert is. \\"Celebration Day\\" is a MUST-OWN for Zeppelin fans. It's a brilliant final chapter for one of rock's most important bands. \\"Thank You\\" to the almighty gods of rock, Led Zeppelin!

1466401885|5.0|I received this book as a gift. I was a little \\"meh\\" about it when I read the back cover but...I feel in love with Travis. His love for his Pidge is so sweet. I know a lot of people are saying that it's abusive and unhealthy. It does have elements of the unhealthy but I don't see it as abusive. Yes, he will kick the butt of anyone hurting his girl and has jealousy issues but if you read it until the end you realize...why. Love is scary and we all are scared of losing the person we love. I still love the book and the love story. I am anxiously awaiting \\"Walking Disaster\\"!
B006MW3VC4|5.0|ITV have confirmed Downton Abbey will get a fourth series in autumn 2013.  Filming of eight new episodes plus an extended special episode for Christmas will begin in February next year.  Executive Producer Gareth Neame said there will be some new faces as well as popular characters returning.  \\"Viewers can look forward to more drama, comedy, love, hatred, jealousy, rivalry, ambition, despair and romance.\\"  Series four will continue the story of the Crawley family and their servants in the early 1920s.  The drama is filmed at Highclere Castle in Berkshire and Ealing Studios in West London.  This year there will be another Christmas special broadcast at 9pm on December 25th.  It sees Lord and Lady Grantham and family heading for a summer break in The Highlands of Scotland, leaving most of their servants back at home.  Last year's festive special attracted the biggest audience on Christmas Day, with 11.59 million viewers beating EastEnders' figure of 11.33 million.  ITV say ratings for the whole of series three averaged out at 11.9 million people in Britain alone.

190840714X|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3TRL3C3P7O948]]<br />TO HOUSING PRACTITIONERS, LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND OTHERS INVOLVED IN ISSUES RELATING TO RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY - NOW IN A NEW SEVENTH EDITION<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Appropriate to their remit, the Legal Action Group, has brought out another publication that -- since the first edition was published in 1980 -- has proved itself invaluable, not just for practitioners, but for the general reader as well.<br /><br />As the LAG is the access to justice charity, this new 7th edition of `Quite Enjoyment' does precisely that: it offers access to justice, this time for the beleaguered householder and/or tenant faced with harassment and therefore deprived of the quiet enjoyment of his or her home.  Not for nothing does the New Law Journal refer to `Quiet Enjoyment' as the essential handbook for this area of practice.<br /><br />In essence it aims to provide a practical guide to the law and clarifies all the relevant issues pertaining to the rights of occupiers of residential property.<br /><br />The book is logically divided into two parts to cover both civil and criminal proceedings. The section on civil proceedings deals, for example, with causes of action... breach of contract... torts specific to unlawful eviction... and of course much more.<br /><br />Part II on criminal proceedings covers mainly the areas relating to three pieces of legislation:  Protection from Eviction Act 1977... from Harassment Act 1997... and the Criminal Law Act 1977.<br /><br />New to this edition is an additional appendix which covers other remedies of which victims of harassment or unlawful eviction may avail themselves.  There are additional powers dealt with aimed at anti-social behaviour, including noise.<br /><br />Resources for further study and research abound in this extensively footnoted, thorough and thoroughly readable work of reference, including table of cases, statutes, statutory instruments and European legislation.  As a further aid to navigation, there's a detailed index at the back, together with three appendices, including the one covering other remedies just mentioned.<br /><br />If you're a practitioner specializing in housing, or involved in tenancy relations, or possibly just needing plain-speaking advice yourself, this is the definitive source of the advice you looking for, in both handy paperback format, or as an e-book.

0385536828|4.0|Reviews of Ian McEwan's latest book, Sweet Tooth, are already posted, including many details of the book. I hope that I do not repeat too much of what has already been written. Having read  Saturday and Atonement by McEwan and loved both of these books, I read this new book, over these past days of Thanksgiving food preparation and visits of children,every moment when I did not have to do something practical immediately. So, the book is intriguing, full of \\"side stories,\\" (don't be fooled), and again, as in other of McEwan's books, a denounement at the end that makes me want to and need to reread the book asap.<br />One reason that the book is disturbing, and I suppose that this is a good part of the book, is its seductive qualities--the reader must keep on reading. But, in this book's twisted world, in which the motives for action and relationships are both extremely self-serving and also very believable, how can individuals find a reality that makes sense, that does not add to the chaos our world already offers and already is? Perhaps I am still, at my advanced age, still childish, still looking for some kind of knowable ending, in order to feel some controls within the chaos.<br />In actuality, the author's other books, Saturday and Atonement, were so tightly written that the reader could pronounce the themes of these books and follow the symbolisms of the books and closely relate the author's ideas to the world that is in the news each day. This new book is not so easily related to everyday events. I think that change in emphasis is an advance in McEwans' writing.<br />I leave, relunctantly, this review with this question: What is Sweet Touth, and is McEwan saying something about the workings of governmental functions in addition to telling tthe story of the people in the book? No, this is mainly a story about people and what we can do to each other, calling into question whether we have a \\"helpful\\" gene or are really extremely selfish, with society trying and not succeeding to make us truly willing to connect with other people.

B008G33NFC|5.0|Hi ya'll Tarja fans, just wanna start off by saying I am a big Tarja fan since Tarja's beginnings with Nightwish and am still a Nightwish fan too. Got my DVD yeaterday at my local FYE store and watched Disc 1 this morning. This concert is amazing and watching Tarja perform brings back memories of her performance on the \\"End Of An Era\\" DVD. The sound and picture is perfect as you get the highest quality sound of DTS and picture perfect quality. The concert was shot perfectly as it was not made like an MTV video (camera moving everywhere, zooming in and out sporadically, ect...). So overall this is an awesome package put together. Highly recommended to everyone that loves this genre of metal!
0425263908|1.0|I could NOT get into this book. Its written very hokey and the girl is so pathetic that I lost all interest. If you like the &#34;helplessly awkward woman meets rude oversexual d-bag&#34; then read this book.... infact, take my copy, please
0316228532|4.0|Like many other readers, I was delighted to hear awhile back that JK Rowling had an adult novel for us...adult like it was written for adults, not that it was going to be some erotic romance or anything like that.  I preordered a copy the day it became available, and lamented the fact that I couldn't pick it up as soon as it arrived, since I was traveling overseas at the time.  Meanwhile, as reviews started popping up around the internet, I was disappointed to read that people seem to have quite mixed opinions about this novel.<br /><br />After reading the entire thing, I can see why people have these mixed feelings.  This novel is nothing like Harry Potter in the story elements, the chief among them being that this is set in the actual world without any magic, no true heroes or villains, and no one overwhelmingly charming or likeable.  In fact, I would go so far as to say that the only character in this novel who isn't mildly repulsive in some way is our deceased gentleman, Barry.<br /><br />With all that in mind, if you only liked the Harry Potter series because of the magic and all that, this novel won't be your kind of thing.  Rowling breaks any mold we may have put her in, shows us that she's not afraid to tackle evil in the real world, and really demonstrates what a remarkable writer she is.  If nothing else, it took me at least four or five HP books before I shed some tears, but this one had me going by the end.<br /><br />Rather than telling us a story about good versus evil, this novel is about life.  Regardless of where you're from, you can probably recognize something of your life in one or more of the characters, whether that's the unhappy/happy marriage, the singledom with or without a child, neglect and abuse, going beyond expectations to break the stereotype of your life, or just being an average teenager.  The teens in this novel aren't without their flaws either: they are cruel, confused, destructive, and trying to find their way to adulthood.  Oh, and most of them hate their parents.  Shocker!<br /><br />I feel like I can't review this without at least mentioning to y'all that there are some difficult situations, and if you've got triggers for things you can't read, this might hit them.  There's abuse, both emotional and physical.  A lot of talk about drug use and what it's like for an addict trying hard to stay clean.  There are many instances of bullying and the self-injury that can result from that.  This book really does not pull any punches when it comes to these hard truths of life, and shows us what can lie behind closed doors inside any of our communities.  But if these situations are hard for you to read, I would say be warned that they exist.<br /><br />In some ways, this was an exhausting read, but I mean that in the best way.  I'm glad I read it, and I'm happy to have it on my shelf, yet I won't be picking it up again for awhile.  What I can say is that I'm very excited to see what Rowling comes up with next, and that people who enjoy good writing or character studies will enjoy this one.and most of them hate their parents.

B006P0FICE|1.0|A previous reviewer was absolutely right to ask if there was a rating lower than 1 star. This is unfortunately another example of a mostly excellent group of actors given really clunky dialogue and inserted into a silly film. Its amazing to remember that the fun story of the Three Musketeers was already written. Its not like they came up with a goofy story and made a bad movie out of it. They just took an exciting story and made a stupid movie out it. I've seen all the actors in this movie before and have enjoyed their work, but they just had nothing to work with here. The only one who I thought did sort of a bad acting job was Logan Lerman as D'Artagnan. I didn't believe him in that part for a second.<br /><br />On the plus side, this is one gorgeous-looking movie. You could pause it at pretty much any point and be looking at a work of art on screen. Great costumes, fantastic sets and scenery, and pretty-nice CG.<br /><br />So, to wrap up: Beautiful-looking movie, good cast, terrible dialogue, silly story, bad to terrible acting, horrible direction. I just bought this at a good price from Amazon and it is the first one ever that I will be immediately selling. I was extremely disappointed with this film and feel sort of bad for the actors involved in it. I usually defend Paul W.S. Anderson as a director and have genuinely enjoyed a couple of his films (Event Horizon, Resident Evil), but this one is really a stinker.

B003WUYP56|5.0|Smolin gives a history of most of the great discoveries and insights in Physics, an explanation of the how and why of those discoveries, and a critique of the present situation in that field today, all in one book, and in a way that someone with little background in mathematics can understand, most of the time. Even when he lost me, for example, in introducing gauge theory, Smolin was able to keep my attention and make me want to read on.

B008SGMPVU|3.0|I have been a fan of Dark Star since I first saw it on Select TV years ago. Got it on VHS, and then DVD. Was rather happy for the Blu-ray release, until I watched it. While the movie is as great as it always has been, the disc have a few minor audio defects on it (and this is on multiple discs I have tried - so guessing it is a bad batch from the manufacturer). At 102.11 into the movie, crackling sounds. Then again at 102.37. At 102. 40 is were the audio repeats over itself for about 5 seconds. Not horrible (which is why I'm keeping my 2nd copy from Amazon), but for any disc, I expect no defects. Not a happy camper. :(
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I like how the Arthur addressed it to the reader as if, knew who you were. This was the first book I reed on my own, I would rec amend this book to any one that wonted to read something and feel apart of what they are reading. I saw the preview of the movie and I had to find out if the book was actually better then than movie like everyone tells my. The word choice is very good it encumbers the way you think about the writer. This was a very good book. The style that it was written was very unique and outside the box that left you wanting more. I felt the ending needed more to it.

0545091020|4.0|This is an engaging book and a really excellent film but the choice of narrator for the audio book was not the best. She reads every sentence like she's addressing a political convention, using the same inflection with every phrase and sentence. Rarely when she's voicing the different characters she breaks away from her monotonous intonations. There are plenty of well-narrated and performed audio books out there including children's and young adults books, but this one falls short.<br /><br />Update: After listening to all three audio books in this series, i realize that the narrator has done a good job of performing all the different speaking voices. Her narrator voice is still monotonous, but it grew on me because the story and individual voices were so compelling.

B003IWZ1D8|2.0|If you are like me and believe it is moral values that make a country great, then the movie Psycho makes a convenient historical threshold to mark when American began its decline. Film is a very powerful medium, and unfortunately it's been the main factor in destroying the good values at the heart of American society.<br /><br />I saw this movie once and I did not enjoy it. I'm not a horror fan.<br /><br />OK, so it was crafted by a genius, whatever. A pile of dog crap sculpted into an amazing aesthetic shape might be sculpture, but it's also still dog crap. To be great, art must be both great in form and great in content. The best art inspires the human spirit.<br /><br />I don't imagine my opinion will be popular here, so go ahead and let the \\"thumbs down\\" fly, folks. I think what I'm saying it true.<br /><br />I quote from an AP news article from Nov. 23, 2012, titled \\"After 'Psycho,' a shower of violence in movies\\":<br /><br />Psycho \\"was revolutionary in its violence, its sexiness, its sympathy to the perspective of the criminal mind - and, perhaps above all, its technique.<br /><br />\\"That Psycho killed off its star - Janet Leigh - after just half an hour was only one of its many unheard of elements. Scenes of Leigh in her underwear were unusual for their time, too, and prompted lengthy negotiations between Hitchcock and the sensors. Even a flushing toilet - considered a vulgar sight - had never been seen in such a big movie.<br /><br />\\"It's one of the most influential films ever made,\\" says [critic David] Thomson. \\"It's the beginnings of a flood of violence. Violence becomes more acceptable in film. It's a whole new attitude to the criminal personality.<br /><br />\\"It was a point in history where we were going from an idealistic, stylized imagination of what America could be, to this very visceral, brutal, violent period where the president is getting killed and people are getting assassinated,\\" says [Sacha] Gervasi.

0199536619|5.0|this book is a classic and should be read by all. That being said, it's not particularly easy to read, but it's magical none the less.
B009H442DG|5.0|Love Livvy and how fun to have this reunion cd to celebrate the Holidays.  Love \\"Baby it's Cold Outside\\" as it all cheeky and personality and same for \\"The Christmas Song.\\" \\"Silent Night\\" beautiful as it stacks and grows. The final track has Travolta sounding very warm to duel \\"Christmastime is Here\\" with Olivia's \\"Auld Lang Syne\\" with her regal voice- all heartfelt and emotion- reminding us again why so many of us fell in love with the beautiful Aussie in the first place.  Add to the idea of this cd's potential of becoming a yearly holiday best seller for each new generation of GREASE fans to discover that it is 100% artist proceeds as perpetual charity proves this twosome will forever be in our hearts affectionately as 'the ones that we want'.
B00006RIO7|5.0|Good to hear all those great Chicago songs again. Brings back so many memories of that great musical. Especially liked Mr. Cellophane.
B007V5XT1O|1.0|I'm afraid that the title of this song is accurate; I offer you a guarantee that if you know anything about music, you'll be \\"Blown Away\\" by how awful and generic this \\"music\\" is.

B002L4QP0M|4.0|I found the book very interesting. It showed lots of imagination that was presented in a way that kept me enthralled. I could hardly wait to get to the next chapter and find out what was to happen next.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|I thought this was a very good Sci-Fi movie, not sure why so many different reviews. It must be a question of taste... I have been told it was not worth watching, but I am glad I did as I really have enjoyed it. It is much better than most of other sci-fi movies released over the past few years. Definitely five stars.
B000JMKO3C|4.0|I think Veronika really needed to kill her former self in order to become who she wanted to be.  In our modern day lives what society expects of a person can become a self imposed prison. I think for some people they become aware of this and have a need to break free and find a different existence or reality.
1439102813|4.0|My grandmother died of Alzheimer's - her first symptoms appeared when she was in her early 50's and she was diagnosed at 55. This was in the 1980's when less was known about early onset Alzheimer's. My mom made it through her 50's in a panic that it would happen to her, and now it's my turn. I read this book for a book group, so with a group of women ranging from 30-50+. We all agreed that it made us hyper-aware of everything we forgot. I agree with the other reviews that say the author is likely a better neurologist than writer - some of the plot points were heavy-handed and sometimes it read more like a popular non-fiction than gripping fiction. However I do give her credit for getting to the diagnosis early, not dragging out the agony. The illness progression, based on my experience, was exact, not over-drawn.
B0000DC13U|5.0|The uninitiated should be aware that this movie is primarily a Godard film, and thus it is  unconventional, yet with patience will yield great results. On the one hand, it is a great film which shows the Stones at work finalizing their famous song, Sympathy for the Devil. This being a Godard film, the action in the film will break to show something seemingly completely unrelated. It is the job of the viewer to harmonize the two and make sense of the message the great director is intending to convey.<br /><br />The following is a rough summary of the film itself. It is not intended to be a spoiler, because, being a Godard film, it must be experienced and viewed to be fully appreciated. By referring to this rough guide, some sense of the entire film may be made easier.<br /><br />First, there are the opening credits.<br /><br />Then the camera pans to a hand-painted sign which says, I believe, \\"The Rolling Stones,\\" in anagram.<br /><br />The camera cues to the Stones in rehearsal. Mick Jagger is singing an obvious demo of the lyrics, with the camera panning to Keith Richards, then Bill Wyman, Nicky Hopkins, and Charlie Watts in the background.<br /><br />Cue to a hand painted writing on the screen saying \\"Hilton Stair,\\" then activity in a hotel room.<br /><br />Cue to the Stones in rehearsal again.<br /><br />Cue to a Scene of a store, the Trenchman.<br /><br />Cue to the Stones in rehearsal.<br /><br />Cue to a Hand painted sign, \\"Outside Black Novel,\\" showing a someone reading from a book, apparently about black empowerment, in an auto wrecking yard.<br /><br />Cue to a Hand painted sign, \\"Sights and Sounds,\\" with the letters \\"SDS\\" in black letters, the rest in red.<br /><br />Cue to the Stones in rehearsal, the camera using extended panning on each Stone.<br /><br />Cue to a Hand painted sign, \\"All About Eve,\\" where a reporter with a camera asks questions, some thought-provoking, others silly, to a young woman in a forest.<br /><br />Cue to a Hand painted sign, \\"Hi FI Ction Science,\\" with the words \\"ONE\\" in black letters and the rest in red.<br /><br />Cue to the Stones in rehearsal. The rehearsal breaks abruptly to a person spray-painting a car with the following word-gram of the words, \\"Mao\\" and \\"Art.\\"<br /><br />Cue back to the Stones in rehearsal.<br /><br />Cue to a hand-painted sign, \\"Hi FI Ction Science.\\"<br /><br />Cue back to the Stones in rehearsal. The song is coming along to its recognizable, familiar sound.<br /><br />Cue to a hand-painted sign, \\"1 Plus 1 makes 2,\\"spray-painted on a wall of the wharf, the rhythm tack of Sympathy for the Devil in the background.<br /><br />Cue back to the Stones in rehearsal.<br /><br />Cue to a hand-painted sign, \\"Black Inside Syntax,\\" where a black interviewee is being asked questions about Black Power and revolution. The interview continues to the auto wrecking yard.<br /><br />Cue to a hand-painted sign, \\"Changes in SoCIAty.\\" A reference, of course, to the CIA.<br /><br />Cue back to the Stones in rehearsal.<br /><br />Cue to a hand-painted sign which is, this reviewer believes, a cross of two messages, \\"The Stones,\\" and \\"On the Beach.\\" There is gunfire and fighting on the beach.  Closing credits feature the finished song in the background.<br /><br />As Godard films go, this is more coherent than most. The Sixties, particularly 1968, when Beggars Banquet, the album which opens with Sympathy for the Devil, was being recorded. There were student demonstrations in London and Paris and the United States. These demonstrations were definitely on Godard's mind when he presented the hand painted sign which empathized the letters, \\"SDS,\\" standing for the Students for a Democratic Society, one of the many student groups existing at that time. They were politically charged times, and the energy and urgency of those times are reflected in the political messages found in the many cues from the Stones rehearsals.<br /><br />The great treat is seeing the Stones in the recording studio. Thedynamics of the group can be clearly seen in the portions of the film showing the recording of the song. The Glimmer Twins, Jagger and Richards, had clearly formed a prominent role in the group, and Brian Jones, once the leader of the group, was detached and acted uninvolved in the progression of the song. One of the most talented members of the group, he was clearly on automatic pilot. He died six months after the film was released.<br /><br />The film deserves five stars if not for a glimpse of how the Stones recorded in the studio and is one of the finer Godard films. A must see.dynamics of the group can be clearly seen in the portions of the film showing the recording of the song.

B009X01GJ2|5.0|Marware continues to make fantastic products. Sturdy, protective, easy to use. I purchased this case because it will rotate my Fire horizontal or vertical, a great, easy to use feature.
0307474712|3.0|The device here, which I won't give away, is terrific. It almost makes this maudlin book bearable, but not quite. The characters are cliche and the plot forgettable.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book... I have not seen the movie, but I suspect it is not similar.  The movie is rated PG, this book is probably more like a PG13 or PG 14 if there was such a thing.  Many grim  and/or disturbing realities.  Yet it has an overall positive and sometimes humorous message of survival, perseverance, and tolerance.
B0052AC8C6|5.0|This was a very funny movie. I was surprised it only had 3 plus stars. The main characters are well developed. It has something for the whole family. If you have small children (4 and under)beware of parts that involve a giant, gun slinging snake that can be very frightening.
B0092QITO2|4.0|I had read many of those one star reviews here and could hardly feel for them. The movie is by no means crap. Definitely the original one is a real classic. I think the producer and the director of this remake knew it well and they respect that. Yet, they had definitely put significant amount of energy and resources to pay homage to the old one whilst instilled quite a lot of new stuff in it. Unarguably there were many loopholes in this screenplay. IMHO, those eye catching futuristic designs and the smart chasing scenes had compensated for many of those shortcomings. In case you simply want to relax and enjoy an action movie after a day's hard work, this is for sure a very good choice. If you care about the storyline much and are ready to compare it straightly with the original one, please give this a pass.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Very cute and fun game. A MUST for any Phineas and Fern fan. It's not extremely difficult, so its a great game for kids!

B009LXEBD4|5.0|Wow, having all her hits on one CD is fantastic!  I have all of her studio albums, but having all of her biggest hits and three new songs on this CD is great!  Kelly really has had this many hits, and there is absolutely no filler on here... just that powerful voice singing some of our favorite songs of the last ten years.  It is a real credit to her radio-friendly music and her amazing voice that so many of these songs are still playing on the radio today even though a few of these songs date back 6-10 years.<br /><br />The three new songs on here are some of her strongest tracks to date, and they are all very different from each other too.  \\"Catch My Breath\\" and \\"People Like Us\\" are aimed at the top-40/pop audience, while \\"Don't Rush\\" is a lush country duet with Vince Gil that is reminiscent of country radio in the 80's.  I love all three of them, and it is very likely that \\"People Like Us\\" will be a radio-smash on level with \\"Stronger.\\"<br /><br />If you are at all a fan of Kelly Clarkson, this is your chance to get not only her greatest hits of past eras, but also a glimpse into her future with the three new recordings.  This CD is a MUST BUY!
B007HU4FZ2|1.0|Gibson's goal in this film was to re-ignite the pogroms by showing Jesus' suffering as exaggerated and bloody as possible, and blaming the Jewish people for it.  In the scene where Pilate asks the crowd what Jesus has done to merit execution, the crowd responds by taking the guilt for his death upon themselves and their descendants.  This is in the Aramaic dialogue, but was not shown in the English subtitled version for the U.S.  It was, however, dutifully translated for the versions shown in other countries.  It's a credit to audiences worldwide that they did not take the bait.<br /><br />Part of the reason for this is that \\"Passion of the Christ\\" is nothing more than gore pornography, not much different than [[ASIN:B004KAQV2W Human Centipede]] except for its setting and choice of subject matter.  Much of the film's box-office take was the result of teenage boys going back to see it...over and over and over, like teenage girls and [[ASIN:B0098G7AWS Titanic]].  The religious message, assuming Gibson even had one, was lost in the gleeful bloodbath that takes up most of the film.<br /><br />Ultimately, the film was the result of Gibson's attempt to resolve the primary conflict of his psyche - his fervent belief that the Holocaust never took place, and his profound regret that it was not more effective.
B009QW7HMC|5.0|As usual the writers of The Walking Dead continue to amaze us with their unique style of storytelling. No character is safe, no scene to shocking. I love this show and wait with anticipation weekly.

B0096PS5Q6|5.0|This was a historic event, millions of people around the world watched The King rock and roll from this 1973 television special and companion album.<br />Listen to his great hits like HOund Dog, Burning Love, Johnny B.

Great time in music history!
B009P5S11G|4.0|This is probably the most seasoned that we've seen this Barbadian poptart. Seasoned in dub-step club bangers, strip club anthems, R&amp;B/Pop mashups, and emotionally drenched ballads. Unlike some of her past releases, Rihanna seems to have some connection to what she is singing on this release. You'll find very few generic fillers and more of the Rihanna-style edgy pop that she had developed over the years. She appears calculated and intense in presenting songs that have deeper meanings than their boisterous, showy production and provocative lyrics. She appears serious, far more developed and assured than ever before. The magic of &quot;Unapologetic&quot; is that it has tracks ready for instant replay in the Euroclub scene, the naughtiest of Atlanta strip clubs, commercial pop radio, and those dreary retrospective nights. Such versatility makes her a perfect candidate for the victor of the pop genre. 5/5
B003YL4LYI|5.0|A Song of Ice and Fire is every bit as good as you've heard, and then some. ADoD drags on a big slow in the middle parts as much of the story feels already known after AFfC, but Martin includes enough new developments and plot twists to keep you engaged long enough to reach the real fun part - the last 1/4 or so of the book when all the storylines begin really progressing and the table is set for the final two books. The Winds of Winter can't come soon enough!
B0091LRZZW|4.0|Bought this as a Christmas gift for my mother after she saw the special on PBS. She will be thrilled.

B004JN1D2I|5.0|What can I say that you haven't already heard? A Song of Ice and Fire is an unbelievably amazing series. Get started by watching the amazing HBO series, then jump into these books to explore Westeros on a much deeper level - and get ahead of the show!
B000005HBI|5.0|A cultural blend of the delta blues, a touch of bluegrass, african rhythms, caribbean beats makes this a phenomenal, soulful, moving collection that captivates  your emotion, guides your movement thru her vocal styings and percussions.  Great cd.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book certainly does not take a normal path.  Its characters are different to say the least.  I think that is what kept me reading.
B003MC5N28|5.0|The Giver is a wonderful story that discusses mortality, societal norms, spirituality, and the power and energy within all humans.

B008Z9YLV2|1.0|and it was called \\"Battle Royale\\".<br /><br />I just want to say I stand firm on my opinion and review of this movie despite the barrage of spiteful and extremely petty down votes from over obsessive fans of this series looking to smite anyone who has something other than praise to give this adolescent film.<br /><br />  I completely loved Battle Royale as it was an amazing and unbelievably good movie. It's hard to watch this and not see the similarities and also knowing that Battle Royale came out 10 years before this movie or book was even thought of. I didn't exactly buy into the hype of this movie because of so and actually took my time before deciding to sit down and watch it for the first time. This movie I think was just a bunch of hype the same as Black Swan and all those others than pop up out of no where and all of a sudden seem to capture the attention of the box office. Maybe it's one of those pictures where the book is different and much better but as a movie this one feels overly long and quite boring in a lot of parts. If you've seen Battle Royale or have not, you should definitely watch it. It goes into detail about the things this movie skimps over and explores the characters on a much deeper level. Watching The hunger games I felt I was watching almost like a B-movie rip off of Battle Royale, or how can I put it... it's a lot more toned down and that's which kills the shock value of the story. I think this is one of those movies you only enjoy if you've read the book and get to see it come alive. As for me it just didn't cut it especially since I've seen this done before only better with a much better plot. I'm sure there's die hard fanatics for \\"The hunger games\\" but if you've never seen \\"Battle Royale\\" than you really are just praising a false idol.<br /><br />What makes this movie even more painstaking to watch is that it is long and not very engaging. I found myself pausing the video and running off to do other tasks, and then coming back to it. The movie just seemed to go on and on and on dragging out scenes forever and then having the nerve to give you one of those open endings. This movie is over 2 hours long and the story hardly has any real dialogue to it. You'll find yourself more mesmerized by trying to figure out the ridiculous fashions of this futuristic world. To me that was the more interesting part to watch especially the awkwardly shaped beard of one of the head figure characters. What also struck me was the character Rue and the uproar about the casting for that character. I couldn't believe how nasty people were over the casting of a cute little girl to play her character that basically only had a couple of lines to say. I mean I think if you blinked you'd miss her role in this movie. It really goes to show just how petty certain people can be over absolutely nothing (probably some of these people randomly down voting reviews). Especially in the case of a movie where the race of characters was never described. The biggest surprise was seeing Lenny Kravitz in the film. I didn't even know he was in to acting but his character was random enough so whatever.<br /><br />The one thing I think that really hurt this movie the most was the lack of explanation in the film. The state of the society is never really explained. Why there are 12 districts and all of them are basically low class working districts and the city is lush and rich is never explained. What the \\"hunger\\" part about the entire game/story is about. They only hint at a scene where the main character is starving in flash backs or surprised to get a piece of bread from a friend saying \\"is this real\\" but that's all you get. No explanation at all as to why these districts are basically laborers that provide necessities for the well to do but live in poverty themselves. Just from the hints and I mean very few hints in the movie the children fighting all come from these repressed low class labor societies where they are picked at random tofight in these games and chosen to be the victor (btw that plot is never explained you have to piece it together yourself throughout the entire movie). It looked like the participating districts were rewarded with food or something if I saw correctly in the riots (also unexplained) but whatever. This is just a bad movie for lots of reasons but mostly for not explaining things that should be explained like the background for the story at least. There is just a simple clip shown in the movie about a war and the games sort of being like the Olympics to show that courage and strength still exists (yeah, still very pointless).<br /><br />Here's where Battle Royale does everything so much better. The plot of a group of students being forcefully captured by the government and thrown into a Military war/social project called \\"The Program\\". The kids are handed weapons and supplies at random and told only one of them can survive and they have to kill all of their classmates if they want to make it home alive. The kids don't really understand what is going on (not even the bombs/tracking devices) around their neck. They at first are hesitant to participate in the game but when others start killing each other it suddenly becomes a game of instinct and survival. Some of the kids form social pacts to survive, some like to survive alone, and some just enjoy killing whomever they can find, and some just refuse to participate and try to find another way out. Battle Royale does the story better because its almost like a study of human survival. You get a chance to learn about the background on the characters and their relationship to the other characters which is what makes seeing one of them die or get killed more personal. You don't get to explore any other characters in The Hunger Games but the two main characters \\"Bow girl\\" and \\"Guy who is useless\\". There's also Rue who character depth includes \\"These are Mocking Jays we use them to signal time in my district\\" and that's about as much as you get. For a 2.5hr movie I find The Hunger Games to be extremely vague in a lot of areas it shouldn't be.<br /><br />So basically overall... if you want to see a GOOD movie about Young adults being forced to kill other young adults watch Battle Royale.fight in these games and chosen to be the victor (btw that plot is never explained you have to piece it together yourself throughout the entire movie). It looked like the participating districts were rewarded with food or something if I saw correctly in the riots (also unexplained) but whatever. This is just a bad movie for lots of reasons but mostly for not explaining things that should be explained like the background for the story at least.

B002ZBN13A|5.0|I have a large collecton of music spanning most genres, and depending on my mood, listen to all of it regularly. Over the years, I've noticed that I keep coming back to Evanescence. All of their work is good, especially Fallen. Whether you are looking to rock out, or like myself, prefer the piano ballads (My Immortal, Hello, Good Enough) Evanescence can provide it. It is well documented that Amy Lee has a beautiful voice, but I have always felt that she does not get enough credit as a musician and composer.<br /><br />Recommendation: get this album! As I write this it is part of the Black Friday sale and is only $3.99, a small price to pay for a masterpiece. If possible, see them in concert - it's an awesome show.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This was a lovely tale with humor, adventure and action.  The young princess is at odds with her mother the queen but lessons learned about true love, respect and unselfishness bring them together into quite an adventure.<br /><br />Superb animations, beautiful colors and soundtrack.  Highly recommended for family viewing and the adults will definitely enjoy this as well.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|Beautiful animation but rather boring plot for an adult fan of animation. I am a big fan of witty animation but the story just wasn't here. Gorgeous graphics though! Good job.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|Nice take on a modern day Dark Shadows.  I have been a fan since I was a kid; rushed home from grade school to watch it at 3:30 every day.  Also watched all the Ben Cross renditions.  This a delightfully light and modern take on a show that is an icon.  LOVE IT.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Keep in mind please that I give this a 4 1/2 stars but since I had to choose between the 4 and 5 stars I wanted to weight it more towards the 5.  This film has a scene of mystique about it... if you are seeing it for the first time you aren't quite sure what to be expecting at first.  I will not spoil the films homage and will leave it to the viewer to discover for yourselves.  This film I'd say has a more deft touch than films done by Cameron's Aliens film.  Ridley Scott I think is a true grown up story teller.  There is not gobs of F bombs and the film develops with a sure steady hand.  This is not an over the top SciFi but rather one that I think will be even more regarded as time passes.  This visual art in it will not disappoint but it doesn't overtake the story.
B00607EWYC|5.0|Beautifully and artfully written with a realistic feeling for the times and sensibilities depicted.  I wanted to reread it as soon as I finished.
B00701L5XS|5.0|I like this app; it brings out the boyscout in me.  :)  It reminds me of the good ole days; of Royal Rangers and my grandpa.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|No negatives here. I downloaded the sample and was immediately immersed in an enthralling story line. I purchased the Omnibus Edition and couldn't stop reading.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Lets you browse and open your files more or less like on a desktop.  Even lets you view some media from within the app.
159420411X|3.0|I admit that I probably expected too much of this book. I thought it was a sort of accessible, wide-ranging exposition and analysis of applied probability and inference in everyday and professional problems. It is not. The topic of this book opened the possibility for deep and far reaching discussions on the nature of forecasting in fields in which randomness appears in different ways. It doesn't. So, what does this book offer? Although there are a few interesting passages, as the examples using Bayes rule to assess practical situations, most of the book is a loose and fairly uninteresting recollection of anecdotes.<br />This book needed a lot of editing and fact checking before being released. It screams for a thorough proofreading as there are many typos, misspellings and errors (it was too much for me to see that figures 8.4 and 8.6, which supposedly represent a 1000 element matrix, drawn to visually convey the image of relative frequency, are in fact 25 x 50 = 1250 element matrices!). I cannot help but to think that this book is a product of our times: write a lot and write fast, do not care much how well you do it.
B0071XO8RA|2.0|I really, really (really) wanted to like this book. I bought it based on the strength of the reviews, and on the strength of the gripping first chapter (you can get that as a free kindle dl as of the time of this review). So again, had high hopes and was priming myself up to share this awesome story with friends and all that good stuff.<br /><br />*spoilers below*<br /><br />The only wrench in the gears was that this book really didn't live up to my expectations. Like a few other reviewers have mentioned, the characters are very weak. Certain crucial characterizations (like the male lead falling in love with the main character) as explained as a matter of course. They meet and talk a few times, then we're supposed to believe that Lukas is madly in love with Jules to the point of risking his career and life. That's one example. Jules is also a disappointment; a beautiful (of course) strong-willed independent woman, who becomes bowled over emotionally based on one crush. Annoying. Aside from that stuff, the plot itself also ceases to make sense at many points. The main villain floats around poisoning and hanging people whenever he wants and nobody notices or cares, major plot elements like a \\"case\\" Jules helped solve are left completely vague, entire chunks of the story are introduced quickly and become difficult to care about (I found myself skimming through the uprising chapters). Lukas is kept in IT and not allowed to leave (ok, understandable) but they couldn't figure out a way to get him to a shower for weeks? That's kind of weird, right? Almost as if the writer was too uninspired to figure out another good way to set up conflict. And at many points the dialogue reads like a screenplay and not like how actual people talk. To be fair, nobody in the story is annoying to the point where I threw down the book in disgust, but they aren't exactly memorable either. The main baddy, who I wanted to be very bad, was just kind of boring and dense and inconsistent. And that made me sad.<br /><br />Oh, and the metaphors are super heavy-handed. The sections with Shakespeare quotes preceding them were painfully blunt.<br /><br />There are some good points as well: I like the metaplot, and the descriptions of silo life are adequately moody and evocative. An underwater scene at the end is genuinely terrifying, good job. There was obviously a lot of thought put into the layering, though from a practical standpoint I am fairly sure a silo couldn't function (in real life) (I will suspend disbelief for the sake of his interesting worldbuilding). I can see Howey taking the story a long way, which is good for him I suppose, and for more invested readers. It's really not that terrible of a book, but I feel it's been severely overrated for what it really is, which is a pretty good early novel. Not the masterpiece it's somehow been disguised as by reviewers.<br /><br />The price has also dropped a few bucks from when I bought it, so I'd say yes to picking it up for a quick read, but not if you're looking for something groundbreaking. If you want to read a good, thrilling book about interesting people living in close quarters, maybe a work from a more experienced author, like Vinge's Deepness in the Sky, would be a better choice.made me sad.<br /><br />Oh, and the metaphors are super heavy-handed.

B009FZFONO|5.0|I've been a huge fan of this show since the first episode of Season 1 and Season 3 has been just as good as the other 2. As with some other reviews I've read, I question if this is truly HD but it was certainly good enough for my purpose... I never downloaded a SD version to compare... I connected thru my Blu-Ray player and the purchasing / viewing of the 2 episodes I downloaded went smoothly. Unfortunately for Amazon (fortunately for me) Dish and AMC resolved issues and its back on Dish, so I don't have a need for this at the moment. I would definitely use this service if the need arises in the future.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Bought it to watch on my 47&#34; passive 3DTV.  The 3D is still amazing, though not quite as stellar given my relatively small screen (relative to the IMAX I saw it on in theaters!).  Still as wonderfully immersive, still makes your heart stop when anyone's falling.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a Great read.  I think it is much Better than the movie.  I look forward to reading the next book.
B0072OFM28|5.0|I was concerned about the new lead being able to pull this off, but. He did well!  It was also nice to see life after freedom for the slaves.
B0096HHZGK|5.0|Fell in love with Tom Cruise! This brought back so many good memories. I went and downloaded the soundtrack. Who knew Tom Cruise could sing!
B008GXHOFW|1.0|so bad it won't let me play on it nobody get this game it's. a waste of money stupid game.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Keep in mind, it is just a story. It's a worst case cinerio survival, on a planet no one has ever set foot on, but actually exists. So, what difference does it make if it's not completley accurate. Who knows, besides NASA. It is very well written, very descriptive on points of how he survives, and it's believeable. You'll find yourself cheering for the survivor, even if you think you know what is going to happen.  With that said, it is one of the best stories I have read in a while, especially for the .99 cents. I would have paid way more to read this. I hope to read more from this author!
B004HW7JMO|5.0|More sex and violence than I could handle, but was able to watch because of the truth of those times.  Was done well!
B009SJ3H8Q|4.0|This season seems a bit easier to understand. I like it and hope it will keep my attention. I am hoping it will stay better than the first.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|It will wake you up in a second.  It needs some improvedments like the battery loss.  I find it the best alarm clock on the kindle.
B0029XFNA8|5.0|OK Let me start off by saying this is a Great Classic Christmas Movie. Now the BR is misleading as some People claim it contains both the B&W as well as the Colorized versions of this film. This BR disc does not it only contains the B&W version. The colorized version is not on BR.
B005LAIGLE|5.0|What you'd expect to see with that title.  Mark is great in his role.  Everyone was true to character.  Suspenseful!
B001DPHDCY|1.0|We actually turned this one off after about 45 painful minutes.  Not much else to say, except that it's just dumb...
B00005N6KG|5.0|Headphones are unbelievably expensive. My daughter was looking for something that would stay put and not keep falling off. These were just perfect and not so expensive. Sound was great, too. Hope they last for a long time.
B005LAIHZY|2.0|I went into this film realizing it was rather polarizing and tried to have an open mind. The animation quality was top notch but the story was not very well done and the main character was  unlikeable, whiny, immature and ungrateful.<br /><br />I love most Pixar films and I've enjoyed watching many of them over and over but I have no desire to ever see this again. I'm glad I didn't buy it.
B00067BBSC|5.0|Love Toto, and this was a great package deal!  What a way to complete a collection.  The price was awesome!
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|that's how I saw it...but WOW! it was a piece of art, like a puzzle you work throughout the book and not until the end do you realize what the whole picture is, I was so disappointed when the book ended, I actually exclaimed loudly when I turned the page and found the author's notes or something... I didn't want it to end, a beautiful beautiful book

B0050DIWFC|4.0|Really liked this book. Gave it 4 stars because I did feel like the book dragged on for a bit. Also, if you have any knowledge of the law and proceedings, the trial will feel like an eternity. But keep reading or skim it, the ending is worth it. Overall, its a great book and I recommend it.\\"

B008RJ6TTC|5.0|I have been a fan of Columbo's for many many years.  Most of the shows have good writing in them.  I like most of the guest stars.  Most  of all is that Peter Falk was masterful in playing the Columbo character.  He will be missed.  I'll watch these movies over and over again!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw the movie before reading the book, so now I want to see the movie again.  I found the book to be a great read and it filled in the gaps that are always present when a book is converted to a movie.  The book and movie were outstanding.  I will read the second book before the movie ie released.
B009VB97EY|1.0|This is a real stinker of a movie if you like plot, drama, good acting and an intelligible script.<br />I can't understand why it had good reviews.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|What can I say? My 8 yr old and I saw it in the movies and of course we wanted to see it again. I liked the extras too.
B00846REIS|5.0|I enjoyed the book.  Good story line, and hard to put down.  Kept you riveted with each page.  I hope the second book has a better ending as this one left me hanging!!
B001Q2U5B0|5.0|This is a great movie that does what a suspenseful movie is suppose to do: pull you totally in and then take you on an unpredictable ride that leaves you breathless at the end. Great script, acting, directing, etc. Yes there is graphic violence and definily not for kids under 16, but the plot will intrique you and is laid out in a logical and believable manner. This is in my collection and like to watch it again every year, even though I normally hate to watch a movie again. You won't waste your money.

B008JMKN4Y|1.0|This book started out promising but the more i got into it the more i hated the character of Travis. I thought he turned out to be one of those crazy stalker guys who is crazy and obsessive and really possessive and the kind of guy a woman should get away from. It's not normal for a guy to tattoo your name on himself after a month or normal to not let you be on your own or talk to other people. He Even gets violent whenever Abby does something for herself. At one point he kidnaps abby and forces her to stay at his house and she just lets him and sleeps with him. I think this book sends out a bad message on what relationships should be and the fact that they get married and she gets his name tatted on herself is a stupid ending. Both main characters are not smart people who should not be looked at highly. Abby is someone who doesn't think for herself and just gives into a bad man and travis is the type of guy who is dangerous.
B009329ZF2|3.0|It was okay. The story line was the norm and there really wasn't anything new to the movie that I have not already seen in others
B009VB97EY|1.0|Yes, I was bored and this seemed the best of the crappy choices on On Demand.  Even with that very low expectation, I was let down.  In fact, I turned it off 10 minutes before it ended because I realized just how little I cared about any of it.<br /><br />Pros: Beefcake is nice for a few minutes<br /><br />Cons: everything else: story line (hahahha, as if one were there!), acting (Channing Tatum aside, he did fine with a crap script) especially the woman who played Adam's sister (bad bad bad acting) and the grossness of Matthew McConaughey's character.<br /><br />I was pretty sure it was my old age (52) that made me recoil from the \\"sexy\\" scenes (I was thisclose to yelling \\"Hey you strippers! Get off my lawn!\\") but I see by reading the reviews that age didn't factor into it much.<br /><br />How and why this even got made in the first place, how and why it even made money at the box office and how and why I decided to PAY to rent it are unsolved mysteries for the ages.

B0098VYCCE|1.0|Since when & in what story book was snowwhite a warrior? It was nice to put a twist on the storybook tale but at least let it make sense. The story line was horrible and Kristen Stewart as snowwhite was even worse. Kristen Stewart plays a good character in Twilight but not this movie. Did not like the movie at all
B009NQKPUW|2.0|If this was produced way back when the first Alien films were I'd have rated it higher. In today's film climate it was really nothing new. Same old story rehashed, similar effects. I'd rather roll out the original Alien and watch that again.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I found this to be one of the authors less well written and edited works.<br />The story was difficult to follow and the transitions were not easy to follow.<br />Actually, I was disappointed. However, this will not keep me from waiting and reading the next work.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|For anyone who loved the first two books, this is a great ending to the series. Here's four more words.
B00A6N8F4Y|2.0|The previews to the movie were better than the actual movie. I'm not really for sure if the movie directors are running out of ideas or if all the good actors are old n dead. The begining of the movie was like a soft three way porn and after the girl got kidnapped it was like a rehabilitation session for both ends. Stupid movie
B0071BGOJC|5.0|The first book in this trilogy was a fantastic read, this second one exceeded all expectations.  Ken Follet, is a masterful story teller and weaves history and fiction together seamlessly.  I wish history had been taught like this when I was at school.<br /><br />I was so impressed by this book I went out and bought both books in hardcover for my mom, who grew up in London during the second world war.  Thanks Mr Follet, for a wonderful journey, can't wait for the third book in this series.

B000HT38AS|5.0|I am a great Eastwood fan even if I don't believe in his politics. These are some lesser known films but he is always a treat to watch. Very reasonable price for three films on one disc.
B008KE3960|4.0|Galaxy S2<br />This is a pretty cool game. It is a little different from the normal tower defense game. They have capitalized very nicely on the hybrid. This is a little tower defense and a little Airport Mania. I have Airport Mania and I like it a lot. I can see how Air Patriots might get repetitive, but I have not gotten that far, to get bored with it yet. This is a great game that I feel stands among the better tower defense games. I have about 10-20 tower defense games, and have tried out and uninstalled many more. Air Patriots is staying on my S2.
B003Y5H4SO|5.0|I found this in a bargain bin at WalMart.  I was leery because I've gotten \\"off\\" horror films of late.  On the other hand, I was intrigued by the description on the jacket.<br /><br />What a wonderful surprise!  It is indeed very \\"spooky\\" as a psychological thriller with only a few brief moments of gore.  (And the gory bits are somewhat hidden by lighting.)  The message of movie is excellent and the ending is superb.<br /><br />Side note for prospective Christian viewers:<br />At one point in the movie, a character gives an incorrect response.  The correct response would have been, \\"No I do not deserve forgiveness, but I know that I can be forgiven.\\"  Nobody _deserves_ forgiveness, and we can only get it by Grace.  Otherwise, the movie is pretty safe for adult Christian viewers.
B001DJLD1M|4.0|The first part is the best for sure but you definitely want to see the other parts afterwards. And I have watched them all several times, and don't get bored of it. Just put some time in between watching the series. The only thing that's too bad is that the last part closes with an open ending. It could happen all over again.
B000SW2F8K|5.0|I don't often watch romances, but I thought this was one was impressive.  Changes in setting, music, diverse characters, comedy, and quirky flare like magic rituals and a transgender character helped to make this movie stand out to me.

B005LAIHEA|2.0|Recently watched movie review:<br />*The Five-Year Engagement (2012)- 2/5<br /><br />The Five-Year Engagement is a romantic comedy that Nicholas Stoller produced, wrote (with the help of Jason Segal), and directed; It stars Jason Segal and Emily Blunt. Tom Solomon (Jason Segal) and Violet Barnes (Emily Blunt) are a happy couple who live in San Francisco. Tom and Violet are trying to plan a wedding, but before plans are final, Violet gets accepted into a psychology program at the University of Michigan. Tom, who is a chef at a fancy restaurant, isn't pleased when he finds out there are no fancy restaurants for him to work at in Michigan. Years pass, and Violet finds out the psychology program is going to last longer than expected, so wedding plans will have to wait a little bit longer, and when Tom finds out, he gets sodisillusioned with his life.<br /><br />Jason Segal and Emily Blunt work well together, and are a likeable pair, with a warm-like chemistry. The writing is funny and smart, but then there are times when it's not. There are times where you'll laugh, won't laugh, and don't know if you should laugh; the movie tries so hard to be funny when most of it is just awkward instead. The supporting cast of Tom's best friend Alex (Chris Pratt) and Violet's sister Suzie (Alison Brie) do an awesome job, many times stealing the show. There's a lot of uniqueness put into the film in terms of props and costumes, and I couldn't wait to see what other unique things were going to show up.<br /><br />The Five-Year Engagement feels like a long waiting game; at 124 minutes, you'll find yourself ready for the film to be over with. The film doesn't do a good job in explaining what's stopping Tom and Violet from getting married, which causes the main story to be rather uninteresting and feel sloppy. I was more interested in hearing what the next joke was going to be, and what the next new unique thing was going be, rather than caring if they were ever going to get married. For a movie that's not about sports, I couldn't help but constantly feel overwhelmed with product placements; I felt like I was watching commercials for the University of Michigan, the movie Ratatouille, Michigan restaurants, and some classic metal bands, thus resulting in getting a thumbs down. If you want to laugh a few times, but feel bored at the same time, I'm going to mildly recommend a 'rent.' Otherwise, it gets a 'pass.'movie that's not about sports, I couldn't help but constantly feel overwhelmed with product placements; I felt like I was watching commercials for the University of Michigan, the movie Ratatouille, Michigan restaurants, and some classic metal bands, thus resulting in getting a thumbs down.

B007TNS6JI|5.0|For rapid advancement types like myself this game will cost you some real world money. Slow grinding requires alot of time doing low difficulty maps to gain the gold and jewels needed to buy and upgrade skills and gear.<br /><br />Now this is a awesome game and needs to stop being compared to the 2nd installment of the series as it has little to nothing in common with Dungeon Hunter 2. So when judged on it's own merits Dungeon Hunter 3 is an amazing game that I would put in the top 10 games for the Kindle Fire, and I buy many many games for the fire to such a degree my wife has brought it to my attention more than once. in short I am a pretty good guy to rate a game though I rarely do.<br /><br />This game does however take a great deal of space to install, I myself had to uninstall some games I do not play so much to make enough space for the download.<br /><br />If you are in the market for a well polished classic hack&amp;slash this is hands down the best out there. Got a little extra cash you can really speed your advancement, if not you can still make level 100 with some extra time.

B009MO5960|1.0|Recently watched movie review:<br />*Resident Evil: Retribution (2012)- 1.5/5<br /><br />Resident Evil: Retribution is the 5th installment in the Resident Evil film series. It's based off the Resident Evil video game series, and is written and directed by Paul W.S. Anderson for the 3rd time. The movie has many returning actors and characters, and the series introduces new characters from the video game. Alice (Milla Jovovich) is captured by the Umbrella Corporation, but escapes, and continues to hunt those responsible for the T-Virus outbreak.<br /><br />For a movie series like Resident Evil, I try to watch every single movie again in the series before seeing the latest. I do this for many reasons including being able to fully review from the series. For Resident Evil: Retribution, I didn't watch the previous movies again before watching this film. From memory, I've never been a fan of the Resident Evil movie franchise, and I recall giving Resident Evil: Afterlife (2010) a 3/5 (the highest rating in the series) when I saw it back in 2010. Simply put, Resident Evil: Retribution was a waste of my time and money.<br /><br />For starters, the plot is very uninteresting and I didn't care what happened or who died. Secondly, the deaf child character bugged me; I've never seen a deaf person speak so well, and why are all of the characters acting like she can hear them without sign language? Thirdly, the acting is simply terrible. Fourthly, why are so many of the action scenes in slow-mo? In most movies I love when the action is slowed down, but when I don't care about the movie, it just makes it drag on even longer. Fifthly, I thought the film needed to explain itself a lot more. There are so many unanswered questions, it boggles my mind. Sixthly, there's so much action and not enough story. Lastly, this series has run its course, and unfortunately there's probably going to be another one on the way.<br /><br />Now, there are some things I did like about Resident Evil: Retribution. The new gadgets are cool and the action scenes kick-ass. I really liked the opening credits, and while I saw the movie in 2D, I will recommend that you see it in 3D as there's plenty of cool 3D moments. Well, that about sums up the good parts about the movie. I'm not happy that I didn't watch the previous films again before watching Retribution, and when I watch the series over again, my rating and review might change, but I feel confident enough to write a review now. Overall, if you're a fan of this series, you'll probably like this new edition, but can you really take that much more? To the rest of you viewers, I have to give Resident Evil: Retribution a recommended 'must-pass.'ribution. The new gadgets are cool and the action scenes kick-ass. I really liked the opening credits, and while I saw the movie in 2D, I will recommend that you see it in 3D as there's plenty of cool 3D moments.

B0087ITC56|3.0|That Denzel Washington is a movie star of the first rank is proven once again in Robert Zemeckis' 2012 crisis-driven character study, a film that starts out very strong but then turns into something of a morality play about addiction and personal accountability. Despite the slowdown in the narrative momentum, the actor lends a chilling honesty and his considerable charisma to his textured portrayal of Whip Whitaker, an ace commercial pilot for a regional Southern airline whose debilitating alcoholism forces him to live in a world of denial and distrust. He's middle-age, divorced, and estranged from his son, but he can still party hard with a sexy flight attendant and fly a jet airliner the morning after with the help of a line of cocaine. Their 9AM flight to Atlanta faces severe turbulence upon take-off, but it's nothing Whip can't handle with his skillful bravado intact. Having achieved momentary calm, he falls asleep at the controls after downing a couple of airline-size bottles of vodka mixed with orange juice. Suddenly the jet loses its hydraulics and descends uncontrollably with its engines on fire.<br /><br />To the shock of his by-the-book co-pilot, Whip decides to invert the plane and fly it upside down to achieve some stability in order to maneuver a last-ditch attempt at an emergency landing in an open field populated with a congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses. Miraculously, only six of 102 passengers and crew perish upon impact, and Whip is hailed as a hero much like Sully Sullenberger after he heroically saved a jet on the Hudson River. This exacting sequence is as thrilling as they come in the movies, and Zemeckis ([[ASIN:B0026O475M Cast Away]]) brings a propulsive realism to what must have seemed like a fantastical idea in John Gatins' screenplay. What follows this life-changing incident is far less unique as it becomes clear that Whip's blood alcohol count was well over the legal limit during the flight, and the ensuing investigation could easily destroy his career and send him to prison on manslaughter charges. He gets help from former colleague Charlie Anderson, the pilots' union representative for the airline, as well as Hugh Lang, a severely humorless lawyer who is pushing hard to discredit the toxicology reports which prove Whip's unfit condition for flying. The ongoing public pressure of the case sends Whip into isolation at his late father's farm where he begins another downward spiral into alcohol.<br /><br />He gets involved with recovering heroin addict Nicole whose own story of desperation is juxtaposed with his until they meet at the hospital and enter into a relationship. All this leads to a climactic hearing with the National Transportation Safety Board where his fate will be determined. Washington is onscreen for nearly the film's entire 139-minute running time, and his impassioned performance is fiercely without vanity. He is unafraid to show Whip's pathetic denial of accountability and brings a palpable face to his character's substance abuse. The supporting cast is solid with Don Cheadle lending a calm Machiavellian spirit to Lang and Bruce Greenwood a stalwart presence as unconditionally supportive Charlie. British actress Kelly Reilly ([[ASIN:B000ETRCN0 Mrs. Henderson Presents]]) sports a convincing Southern accent, but I found her a bit too languid as Nicole. In pure scene-stealing mode, John Goodman plays Whip's unapologetic drug dealer Harling Mays like he was redoing Walter Sobchak in [[ASIN:B000I9WW0E The Big Lebowski]]. It's a comically anomalous turn but something of a relief especially during the sturm-und-drang of the film's second half. Speaking of which, Zemeckis and Gatins' unsubtle storytelling approach resuscitates all-too-familiar scenes of alcohol abuse that make the story feel more predictable than it had to be as the inevitable events play themselves out. Regardless, Washington makes the film eminently watchable.roy his career and send him to prison on manslaughter charges.

0316228532|4.0|Try to think of this is a &#34;first novel,&#34; instead of the new book by Rowling, and you just might be impressed.  Ultimately it is too maudlin for my taste, and might have been better with some level of &#34;hook&#34; to the plot (a mystery, for example) but Rowling proves herself a master of small detail and the hypocrisy of small-town life.  None of the characters are especially likable, but then that is the point.  I found myself more impressed in retrospect than while I was reading it.  So although it is not totally successful there is more than enough good writing to make me look forward to her next book.  In spite of some of Ms Rowling interview comments, by the way, it sure as hell isn't Dickens.
B005Y1B3Q0|2.0|Recently watched movie review:<br />*The Expendables (2010)- 2/5<br /><br />The Expendables is an action movie filled with action movie icons. It is written by David Callaham and Sylvester Stallone, and it's directed by Sylvester Stallone. The Expendables stars Jason Statham, Terry Crews, Dolph Lundgren, Jet Li, Mickey Rourke, Bruce Willis, Randy Couture, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Steve Austin, and Sylvester Stallone. The film pays tribute to action films of the 1980s and early 1990s.<br /><br />The Expendables is about a group of elite mercenaries who take on a mission to overthrow South American dictator, General Gaza (David Zayas), and restore order to the troubled island country of Vilena. The group finds out that their target is not General Gaza, but it's James Monroe (Eric Roberts), a former CIA operative who has gone rogue. It's up to Stallone and his old crewmates to get the job done.<br /><br />The Expendables has some fun action scenes, the shootouts are epic, and the dead body count is high. So, what's not to like? Everything else, that's what; the jokes fall flat, the acting is average, the camera is a shaky mess, and you'll find yourself not caring about the stale story. The camera time for most of these actors is not equal, and some viewers may be let down when they find that their favorite star doesn't do, or say anything at all.<br /><br />The Expendables should have been a great film with all of the talented actors, but it falls flat in many regards. I've seen this movie for a total of 2 times, and both times felt like a chore. I asked my wife to watch it the 2nd time, and she turned me down; she had no interest in watching it again, and she likes these kinds of movies. Sure, the film pays tribute to action films of the 1980s and early 1990s, and I consider a lot of those movies to be classics, but The Expendables doesn't come close to being a classic. The Expendables is not entertaining enough for me, or my wife, and I can't give the film anything more than a mild recommended 'rent.'e than a mild recommended 'rent.'

B00993FEUK|4.0|Recently watched movie review:<br />*ParaNorman (2012)- 4/5<br /><br />ParaNorman is a stop-motion comedy thriller from animation company, LAIKA. A boy named Norman Babcock (voiced by Kodi Smit-McPhee) is able to see and speak with the dead. Nobody in town believes that he can see and hear ghosts, and kids make fun of his gift. Norman makes a friend, Neil Downe (voiced by Tucker Albrizzi), who believes Norman can see and speak with ghosts. The two boys are confronted by Norman's Uncle, Mr. Prenderghast (voiced by John Goodman), who tells Norman that he must be the one who has to save the town from the witch by reading a book at the witches grave.<br /><br />ParaNorman has a very unique look throughout the film, and when you finally see those zombies, you may not be scared at all by them. Human characters look oddly shaped and just plain weird, which makes the zombies seem less scary, which I'm fine with as kids may not be so scared of them when they finally see them. The dialogue is very well written and both kids and adults will be pleased, although, ParaNorman is not a movie that I would take my child to go see. There are many stereotypes portrayed throughout the film, and the script is geared a little bit more toward adult humor. ParaNorman doesn't have the best storyline, but that's okay as I was just waiting for the next great dialogue line.<br /><br />The visuals are wonderful, the dialogue is fantastic, but there's something lacking in the film that makes me want to watch this another time; overall it's the poor storyline. Most kids and adults will like ParaNorman, but in my opinion, adults should be aware that it's a more adult oriented movie. I saw ParaNorman in 2D, and since it's already a dark movie with not much noticeable 3D parts, I would suggest sticking with 2D. I can't recommend ParaNorman enough; it's a good film that deserves a highly recommended 'rent.'

B0018CMJSU|3.0|While I loved the original segmented TV presentation, later there was a presentation where the whole thing was put in order of occurrence of the events in the saga.  The Coppola Restoration goes back to the flashback presentation.  Despite this, I loved all the actors' performances, except maybe Sofia Coppola.  She isn't convincing as an actress and should stay behind the camera.  That's just my opinion.
B00009L1TA|3.0|Sergeant Nathan West (Samuel L. Jackson) and his team of army ranger trainees are engaged in a training exercise. The team must navigate through the jungle in hurricane conditions. They are to use live fire to hit targets and then rendezvous us to a bunker. Problem is, not all of the army rangers meet at the bunker and it turns out Nathan West is dead. Someone on the team killed Nathan and now the team must find out who killed him while staying alive themselves. Since only a couple of members from the team are alive, Colonel Bill Styles calls an experienced interrogator, Tom Hardy (John Travolta) who's an ex-ranger, to interrogate Dunbar and Kendall (the only 2 men alive) with Captain Julia Osborne (Connie Nielsen) by his side. Both Dunbar and Kendall have different stories as to what happened. Is Dunbar lying? Is it Kendall who's lying? Or, is neither story correct?<br /><br />The performances are solid and the film is engaging and fun to watch. The film keeps you guessing, and when you think you have the answer, you find yourself not even close to the answer. You're going to be misled and manipulated throughout the whole film, but for me it worked. The characters were interesting enough for me to care about, and it's hard not to like John Travolta.<br /><br />Basic has many plot twists and turns, and for some people, that's a turnoff. There's no doubt, this is a pretty good popcorn flick, but it may not be for everyone. Some people will stop caring and some will feel very cheated at the end; I'm not one of those people and I like to watch Basic once in a blue moon. I give Basic a recommended 'rent.'
B0011N1WE8|5.0|The DVD has a \\"making of\\" feature that's cute, but it is disappointing that there are no deleted scenes - which other reviews say exist. I hope I find those! Pretty much the only other special feature is a Twilight preview, and I hope desperately they didn't kick the deleted scenes off the disc for that.<br /><br />Anyway, my review is for this movie, which I LOVE. Ricci is poised in her starring role as a young blueblood who is born with a deformed nose and ears, due to a generations-old witch's curse on her family. Her parents try to avoid the limelight by faking her death and raising her in isolation to be a high society wife. When she turns 18, they begin the search for a suitor - one of her own kind - who would be willing to marry her and accept her as she is and therefore break the curse.<br /><br />I never thought one way or another about Reese Witherspoon before seeing this movie, but finding out that she was the executive producer and a major force behind this project really impressed me. Her supporting role is funny and different, too. Serious points to her for that - it more than makes up for Sweet Home Alabama.<br /><br />Even if this movie had bad writing or bad acting - which is certainly doesn't - it'd be worth it to watch the set design, props, costumes, and all of the artistic touches that were put into it. It's really impressive.<br /><br />Thankfully we can watch the movie for more than the visuals, because everything else is solid. The movie is a love story told in fairy tale fashion, but it's not just about a romance between Ricci and her would-be Prince Charming. It's also about the love between a daughter and her mother, who have an imperfect relationship to say the least.<br /><br />This story has its share of dramatic elements, but it's mostly a sweet comedy that draws from absurd conceits and the smaller interactions between charismatic actors that are milked to perfection. This makes it better the more you watch it - on the 2nd or 3rd viewing I found myself noticing these smaller moments and laughing out loud. The pacing of the film draws out moments when it's worth it for the story, and it works well, particularly as Penelope and Max/Johnny are just beginning to know each other.<br /><br />The casting and the acting is superb. I haven't seen Ricci in much else, but I thought she did a good job here. She does best when paired in interactions with Catherine O'Hara, who is flawless as Mrs. Wilhern, and most of all with James McAvoy's character. He is a powerhouse of acting and charisma not many actresses could share a screen with and still be remembered. His character in this film is kind of a loser as written, but McAvoy's performance makes his low points and his redemption credible. This was the first film I've seen him in and I would go well out of my way to check out a movie of his now based on the strength of his performance. (And it's worth the retail price of the movie for the scene were Penelope is supposed to guess what instrument he can play - it's great to see an actor willing to sing THAT badly. It's ridiculously endearing.)<br /><br />The supporting actors are a joy to watch, too. One of Penelope's traumatized potential suitors who appears throughout the film is a snotty weasel that you have to love to hate, and still enjoy when he's on screen. A tabloid photographer who's determined to get a photo of Penelope is perhaps the best supporting actor, both hilarious and believable as a dramatic agent in the story. The actors who have short, sweet scenes weren't overlooked, either.<br /><br />There are a lot of movies out there about learning to accept yourself, or journeys of exploration and redemption, and certainly many about unlikely romances. Very few of them are as good as this movie, and I've never seen a movie that combined them all in such a satisfying way.
B002VPE1B6|3.0|I preordered this because i knew it will be awesome. And it was. The execution is fantastic but the story is so last year that it hurts my brain. You could simply put the characters into 21st century and give them some weapons and fast and furious cars and there you have it. The tree could be some building and sleeping cocoons could be some drug or similar.<br />Well i simplified it a lot but you get the picture (pun intended). I have to admit i saw it only once. I would really like to watch it again but i cannot make myself doing it.

B0085Z3B2Q|2.0|Recently watched movie review:<br />*Dr Seuss's The Lorax (2012)- 2/5<br /><br />Dr Seuss's The Lorax is a family friendly, animation film that's based on the book of the same name. Ted (voiced by Zac Efron) lives in a 'real' treeless town called 'Thneedville.' He has a major crush on Audrey (voiced by Taylor Swift) and will do anything for her attention and love. You see, the town of Thneedville has trees spread throughout the city, but the trees are all fake. Ted finds out that Audrey would get married on the spot if someone were to find a real tree. He asks his grandma (voiced by Betty White) where he can find one. She suggests that he find 'The Once-ler,\\" as he might know where to find a real tree. Ted finds The Once-ler (voiced by Ed Helms), but is asked to listen to a story before finding out where one might be. The Once-ler tells a story of his past, and soon you'll find out why 'The Lorax' (voiced by Danny DeVito) pops out of a tree stump to protect his world.<br /><br />From the same studio (Illumination Entertainment) that created Despicable Me (my favorite movie of 2010), I had hope that The Lorax would be at least a decent film. Unfortunately, I almost had to stop watching it as I was getting very disappointed with the quality of the film. I found that the movie focused too much on 'save the environment' and 'capitalism is bad' messages rather than making a good film. I found the writing to be a mixed bag as sometimes it was good, but then other times is was just plain goofy. I also wasn't a fan of any of the characters, and I have to blame the writing, especially the writing for character 'Ted.' I didn't like anything he had to say and that's a major problem as he's a main character.<br /><br />While I didn't like any of the characters, I did however like the 'animals' instead, except The Lorax; the animals didn't speak, but rather their emotions shined. Just like Despicable Me, Illumination Entertainment knows how to create perfect emotions/animations for their background characters that don't involve people. The animals all look cute and adorable, and I found myself looking forward to seeing what the next animal emotion/animation would be. Illumination Entertainment did a great job with the minions in Despicable Me, and while the minions made the movie, at least that film was backed by awesome writing, and very likable characters.<br /><br />The Lorax looks beautiful with vibrant colors throughout. The animals did a great job with the script, and there are a couple of catchy tunes. Unfortunately, everything else falls flat. Will most young audiences get the messages the film tries to shove down their throats? I'm going to say, no. Will most adults want to watch this more than once? Probably not.

0307279189|4.0|The New York Times article about the death of \\"Caballo Blanco\\" prompted me to seek out this book, which was a quick and enjoyable read.  Christopher McDougall has a gift with prose that made the story and the context provided both interesting and fun.  In addition to the story about the Tarahumara and the history of distance running, the asides about Nike and the mechanics of running compelled me to run more and try out the new barefoot running shoes.  McDougall is funny - obviously a strong runner but somehow managed to write with humility that makes him sound like the weekend warrior who struggles to complete a 5k at his kids' school.  His storytelling about his training and his runs with Caballo Blanco made me laugh out loud, as well as made me think that I, too could be at least a marathoner.  And - when I'm running in my expensive barefoot running shoes, I think of McDougall wryly pointing out that only Nike can make money off of selling shoes to people who want to be barefoot...
B009MF56GC|4.0|The Expendables 2 is a sequel to the 2010 feature film, and I'm happy to say that it's better than the first movie. Like the first film, The Expendables 2 pays tribute to action films of the 1980s and early 1990s, but this time it's not directed by Sylvester Stallone, but rather Simon West, and the shaky camera from the first film is gone, which is a plus.<br /><br />The group of elite mercenaries are sent out to retrieve an item from a safe in an airplane that was shot down in Albania. Church (Bruce Willis) has Maggie Chan (Yu Nan) join the mercenaries because she's a technical expert, and is able to crack the safe once the team finds it. The mercenaries get ambushed by an arms dealer, Jean Vilain (Jean-Claude Van Damme), who wants the item the team retrieved from the safe. The team surrenders the item, but Jean Vilain kills one of their teammates. The team must retrieve the item from the safe while avenging their fallen comrade's death.<br /><br />The Expendables 2 has a great cast which includes: Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Chuck Norris, Bruce Willis, Randy Couture, Terry Crews, Liam Hemsworth, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Nan Yu. Unlike the first film, I found that the Expendables 2 shared more camera time with the actors, although Jet Li's camera time got cut into half from the first, and Jet Li fans will be highly disappointed.<br /><br />This time around, the jokes don't fall flat, the action scenes are better staged, the script is better written, and the plot is more enjoyable. The Expendables 2 isn't a great movie, but it does a better job at capturing a good 80/90's action flick. The action is plenty, the plot is still thin, but I definitely enjoyed this better than the first movie, as did my wife. Overall, if you like action films, you'll be satisfied. If you want to see the movie because of the actors, you'll be more satisfied this time around. The Expendables 2 gets a highly recommended 'rent.'

B007REV4T8|5.0|Recently watched movie review:<br />*Skyfall (2012)- 5/5<br /><br />Skyfall is the 23rd spy film in the James Bond Series and also celebrates its 50th year as a series. It stars 'Daniel Craig' for the 3rd time as James Bond, also known as 007, and 'Javier Bardem' as Raoul Silva, as the new villain for the series. The film was directed by Sam Mendes and written by Neal Purvis, John Logan, and Robert Wade.<br /><br />An unknown terrorist blows up MI6 headquarters and is revealing the names of undercover operatives. James Bond must track down and destroy the threat, while 'M' (Judi Dench), who's' the Head of Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), comes under political pressure to retire. Skyfall is the 3rd movie I've seen in the series along with one that stared 'Pierce Brosnan' as James Bond and Casino Royale that also starred 'Daniel Craig.'<br /><br />Since I've only seen 3 bond movies (2 with the same actor), I can't compare who's the better bond, and since I haven't read the books, I don't even know what to expect from 'Bond.' I mentioned that I saw a James Bond movie that starred 'Pierce Brosnan', but I don't remember that movie at all. I reviewed Skyfall by comparing it to Casino Royale as well as its own film.<br /><br />From the very beginning I feared that my same complaint with Casino Royale would happen again in Skyfall; a 15-20 minute chase without anything really being explained, but alas, more explaining was done in Skyfall thus making this 15-20 minute chase actually enjoyable. After the chase, the opening credits roll with 'Adele' singing her new hit 'Skyfall,' and while the credits were rolling, I knew that this movie was going to have some tremendous value.<br /><br />Skyfall is visually stunning from the landmarks to the special effects. The movie is filled with talent, and 'Javier Bardem' does an awesome job as the sadistic lunatic. The action sequences are expertly done and the closing scene is close to being perfect if the series were to end today. The fight scenes are easy to follow and the cinematography is outstanding. Compared to Casino Royale, Skyfall seemed to have less action and more narrative, which I found satisfying. I wasn't pumped to go see Skyfall as I'm clearly not a James Bond fanboy, but after seeing it once, I'm pumped to see it again.

1426209584|5.0|It's probably not really possible to do justice to the Birds of Paradise in a book. That's why the video that is available as well should be obtained as well. (Not sure whether it will run on European computers though. This stupid area coding needs to be abandoned, at least in such cases where there is no alternative source.) The fine trailer shows these birds in their fascinating movements. Thus, the book is in a way a substitute only, as it can't really convey movements well. But with that limitation, this is nevertheless a stunning book. It provides lots of info and photos of this spectacular bird group. And we also get to see what it takes to reap such a fine harvest of photos and video sequences. I like the horizontal format as it allows fine wide spreads of pictures. National Geographic has long had a tendency to rather publish underexposed than overly bright pictures. And to my eyes, their pictures are often overly brownish-reddish. This book is no exception. A typical example is on p. 72, where the water of the stream is probably more gray than it should be, particularly in the highlights. And I suspect that the cover is also a typical example of the problem mentioned. I think the thumbnail on the Amazon page is closer to the true colors regarding the branch and the background. The benefit of the general underexposure is that the spectacular colors are not washed out in the light parts. But instead, the dark parts are often rather lacking details.<br /><br />To see what I mean regarding the red-brown color bias, compare the book with the video. That is quite revealing.

B0099114WO|4.0|A college teaching assistant feels his dopamine levels go through the roof when he meets a beautiful woman taking one of his classes.  Perhaps she also feels hopeful in marrying an older wiser man?  But very shortly after getting married, a three decade long disappointment ensues for Arnold and Kay since getting married for chemistry can only last so long.  With Kay's encouragement they visit a third person to help them out.  A few tips for couples (ie: no name calling, it's okay to be playful, etc) get them started and in the end, they grow to develop a peaceful love relationship although how they really got there perhaps could have used a little more clarity.  I assume that after the retreat they continue their therapy and when Arnold's work friend tells him how he had lost his wife by habitually treating her in an ungrateful way, Arnold comes around to see himself and his wife as imperfect human beings in need of human love.<br /><br />I think it's great that this movie got made because I imagine it could help some couples to rekindle their relationship in a more satisfying way.  It seems to be sending out a very clear message:  It's okay to, and there's no shame in, working with a specialist in marital dynamics.
B004SRNH10|1.0|Unfortunately, this app is not compatible with the Kindle Fire. What's worse is that, instead of explaining why it is not compatible, you are not even able to view any system requirements that Adobe AIR needs to run. Also, the 3.5 Beta does not complete installation on my Android device, or others as can be seen on the Adobe forums. Again, there is no explanation and only a simple \\"Installation Not Completed\\" message. There needs to be more information and interaction with the creators for why these situations occur.

It made me cry and feel like I was there, but at the same time make me wish I was really there. This is classic Coldplay, and the images were clear and beautiful. Seeing everything from the sweat on Chris's face to the bright yellow balloons is great. I was lucky enough to see them for real years later :)

0547884591|5.0|Tim you're the bomb.<br /><br />Having worked as waiter in a past life (now in IT) I realized I was applying many of your principles. What I did find very useful was the wholesome approach of your book, you covered just about everything and singed all the loose ends. Yes eye fillet should be on a square plate (why didn't I think of that) and yes you should dry the herbs or smoothie them up. You're bloody brilliant and thanks again for another insight into efficient living. Now if you could make another book for stuff around the home I think you'd have it all just about covered.

B001AQR3JY|5.0|The Lion King is by far my favorite Disney movie! Although it is a childs movie it captures the adult audience as well! This is a story about a young lion king whose father is the King of the Pride Land. His father teaches him that all of the past kings are alway watching over them from the heavens as Gods that guide them in the right direction. Simba learns about the circle of life and how when we die we become apart of the earth and us dying lets others live generation after generation. It's Simba's uncle Scar who when tryin to take over the Kingdom tricks Simba into believing that he killer his own father and that their herd or tribe will hate him and want to kill him so Scar tells Simba to run away and never to return. Little does he know that Simba will one day will return and take his rightful place as King! Wonderful story of a kingdom of Africa's wildlife from the prairies!

B004KA9VGA|5.0|Debora Harkness' A Discovery of Witches is a captivating book with wonderful descriptive language, drawing the reader into this realistic and yet foreign world. The story starts a little slow, following the life of the main character, a young witch named Diana Bishop, after a few chapters, the story starts to pick up momentum quickly throwing you into the main plot-line, and each time you think things have slowed down, something shocking and exhilarating is thrown at you, quickly pulling your full attention back to the story. A lovely book, eloquently written, I would and do recommend this book to anyone, amazing.

B001K3ENEA|4.0|I've had my K44's for 2 years now and I've been extremely happy with them. I use these headphones when producing music and DJ'ing. Now that I'm looking into better headphones, I'm really happy that I bought these. They're great as stepping-stone headphones. The padding is medium-soft and I'm pretty sure it's pleather. The elastic band on top makes it very comfortable and since this doesn't have many mechanical parts, it's quite difficult to break. I throw mine in my backpack all the time and they haven't been damaged at all in 2 years. The wire is really long, but coiling it has no effect on its performance.<br /><br />This is an amazing set of headphones. The EQ's are pretty good and it's very flexible in the sense that the low/mid/hi's are not very overpowering at all. I also have big ears and there's just enough space to fit my ears inside.<br /><br />CONS:<br />My only complaint is that they make my ears get hot from time to time if I wear them for too long. That probably has something to do with the fact that they're very closed headphones.

I don't usually like hidden object games but this one was different, you don't search the same 2 or 3 scenes over and over again, it's a different scene every time and there was just the right number of them.
B009WUAK2M|2.0|What a boring, predictable show.  Really bad, with no intelligent plot. This is one of those shows that you can't wait to end, though if you're under 12-years old you may like all of the action.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is the 3rd Gillian Flynn book I read and this was my favorite. The story has a lot of twists and turns so just when you thought you had it figured out something new happens.  I was talking about the book with a friend and one thing I told them was that I was surprised I liked the book so much because I really did not like any of the lead characters.  It was a book where I didn't find myself rooting for anyone in particular- I enjoyed it solely for the story and the journey it took me on.
B005J2UM9S|5.0|I love this movie on so many levels. At first I thought it was just a parody film, but I found it to be by far the scariest movie I've ever seen. It's a shining example of what Found footage and Psychological Horror should be. The atmosphere of dread it creates is enough alone to warrant all 5 stars.

B0030U1TLQ|5.0|The Cure's Disintegration album was released on May 1st 1989 to fantastic reviews and became their highest selling album even though the record company said the album was \\"Commercial Suicide\\" and did not believe it would sell one copy. The album is a beautifully melancholic affair and an essential album in Goth music and in the words of Rolling Stone Magazine \\"According to the kids on South Park, this is the best album ever made. According to many depressive Eighties-minded kids, it's the only album ever made\\". The album starts with Plainsong which has a very huge and almost stadium rock sound that fits perfectly as an introduction to the album. Next is the song Pictures of You which can only be described as epic due to its length and the quality of its lyrics. later in the album you will hear songs such as Love Song which was Robert Smith's wedding present to his wife, Lullaby which is a very Creepy song which about being eaten by a spider and inspired by bedtime stories Robert's father told him as a boy. Fascination Street which is probably the most Rock like song on the album and has an extremely incredible backing from the piano, bass and drums. Also along the way you'll hear songs such as Prayers for Rain, Disintegration and Homesick which are easily the three most depressing songs on this album. The album ends on a pretty mellow note though with the song \\"Untitled\\" which gives a very soft ending to an album filled with bombast,aggression,depression and loneliness. I would recommend this album to everyone in fact this is an album i think everyone should hear at least once in their life.<br /><br />Standout Tracks: The entire album is perfect and i'm not overestimating it<br /><br />Rating:5/5

0307887448|5.0|This book is perfect for any child of the 80's.  I was born in 1975, so the Reagan years were an important period of influence on my upbringing.  Ernest Cline has created a joyous celebration of 1980s pop culture with Ready Player One.  Video games, music, movies, cartoons, etc. are all touched upon in the process of telling an epic save-the-world story.  The amount of allusions to other media is positively dizzying.  However, the story and characters are strong enough that, even if you didn't come of age around the time Cline did, there is still a lot to love here.  But if you were born between 1970 and 1980, I'd say the journey will be even sweeter.
B007THA4FI|4.0|J. K. Rowling's novel, The Casual Vacancy, is a very good British village story that captures the atmosphere of a setting US readers may never experience directly. There is a long history of novelists writing in this tradition, one that comes to mind immediately is Simon Brett whose novels involve local mystery stories. I enjoy this style because of the detailed descriptions of the characters and their interactions. A key to this type of fiction is the sharply drawn images of individual emotions of the characters. The presentation of the emotional reactions of the characters is precise, and it is clear to the reader exactly what the characters are going through. This is very difficult to do, and Rowling writes with insight demonstrating a mastery of the technique.<br /><br />The story of the sudden death of a councilman in the small town of Pagford and the politics of a variety of personalities attempting to continue the council's agenda is enjoyable. I like the structure of the novel, like a spiral that starts with a broad circumference and continues in narrower bands as the novel progresses. Characters are drawn from the mundane routines of their daily lives into the vortex of interaction involving the troubling issues of family problems, jealousy, envy, snobbery, poverty, racism, drug abuse, encroaching public housing, hopelessness, child abuse, self-mutilation, displacement, rehabilitation, and possibly fleeing Pagford for a location with less personal involvement with society. The tightening swirl of the action forces all of the important characters to make decisions that they once thought were not required in an idyllic British village.<br /><br />Although The Casual Vacancy is certainly no British cozy, the reader will love the village and the people (some more than others) who are drawn into the spin of upsetting life events precipitated by the death of a charismatic town fixer. In the end, you will be forced to make decisions like the characters to accept the responsibilities and commitment of a local community or flee to the much less connected life of larger cities. There were a few parts of the novel (within a few scenes) in which the thread of the narrative was a bit stretched if not broken, so I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.he responsibilities and commitment of a local community or flee to the much less connected life of larger cities.

1451627297|5.0|As long as this book is, and as indulgent a writer as King has always been, I have to say this is one of my favorite books I've read by him.  The concept is intriguing enough, but it is the characters that really make it great.  Jake/George's falling in love with Sadie and all the consequences that follow are what kept me reading.  I personally enjoyed the minutiae of George's observations of Oswald's comings and goings.  I also think the portrayal of Oswald is very true to what is known about him.  But it was George coming to terms with what he had to do to stop Oswald and how it affected his relationship with Sadie that drove the story.  A really compelling, engrossing read that kept me interested for over eight hundred pages!
B009VSW15Y|2.0|First review<br /><br />I am amazed on how this app works really great. It's very simple and there is no problems with it. But I think it would be more fair if it were at least ninty-nine cents because then almost everyone with a Kindle Fire HD would be able to get it, so then most people actually have a camera. This app works perfectly but Amazon should add a pre-loaded Camera app to the Kindle so we don't have to pay two dollars.<br /><br />Second Review<br /><br />Now, that more people are buying it, they are lowering the price, but come on! You guys could have made much more money when it was ninety-nine cents. I love this app, but I am more annoyed now that they lowered the price after many people bought it and were not impressed. Amazon, I know this is not your app...this is not your app. You should have put this on, pre-built, and nobody would have to spend any money on this app. If this wasn't your idea, why wasn't it? You thought of putting on a camera, why would you not put an app on it? It now crashes whenever I am using it and it annoys me. This app should be free and Amazon, you should be ashamed of yourselves. The Kindle is amazing, but there are many things you could do to improve it and get satisfied reviews, not people criticizing your works. It's disappointing to say, I started off with four stars down to a two.<br /><br />As for you, app developers, I know what you are trying to do. You are 'bribing' people to get the camera app, this was already a function on the kindle, you are bribing people to have something they should already have. You can make money on other things, but not for this.

B000062V9C|5.0|If you look carefully at the particular dvd you bought, you will note that it says Region 2 on the cover. This means that this is a European dvd, so it wont work in an American player. (Try looking it up on wikipedia an1d you will see that I'm telling the truth). In fact the region 1 dvd is a good dvd. It is an easy mistake to make if you don't know about it. In future look and see if it has region 2,3,4,5 or 6 next to it,and if it does then don't buy it.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I was so psyched to read this book that I paid the exorbitant asking price.  Then I began reading and I found it a slow starter.  Usually, this would be death to a book for me, but I plowed on.  I wasn't going to give up on such a talented writer and I'm glad I didn't.  The book is about the ripple effects the death of one man has on a small town, and it was very interesting.  Rowling's talent is evident in bringing the lives of many characters into one story showing how the lives intersect and influence each other.  This is a very European story.  Americans like bright, light, entertaining stories, but Europeans...not so much.  They usually prefer movies and books that are more realistic, and The Casual Vacancy fit the order.  Even though I started out reading as an American, I adapted and really enjoyed the downhill half of the book.  It's worth reading.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|I'm a big ST fan so may be biased but loved this movie. Great casting, storyline,and acting not to mentiong top notch effects. Have seen it three times since it came out and will be one of my favorites on my yearly rewatch list. Althought there have been many sci fi movies made over the years, a vast majority usually fall flat one at least one of the criterias mentioned earlier but not this one. It's all that and a bag of chips. Especially if you've seen every episode of all the variants of Star Trek over the years. They opened it up to a whole new fresh direction. Unlike the Alien movie that is kiind of stuc in the same old story (was let down with the story with Promethus . Expected more) that is not the case with Star Trek.

0525953728|5.0|Was a little hesitant in buying this book. I am really not into military books. However, this was a well told story about the process surrounding that focus of the story.

B006SV2LWA|4.0|Contagion(released Sept/11)is a chilling look at what could happen when an unknown virus breaks out and the CDC and their worldwide counterparts do everything they can to stop it.The film stars Matt Damon as Mitch Emhoff,Laurence Fishburne as Dr. Ellis Cheever,Jude Law as Alan Krumwiede,Gwyneth Paltrow as Elizabeth \\"Beth\\" Emhoff,Kate Winslet as Dr. Erin Mears,Elliott Gould as Dr. Ian Sussman and many others.<br />The story starts with the players who contract a nasty virus of unknown origin,which spreads slowly throughout the world.As is always the case,third world countries get hit the hardest and quickest.We start our focus on Paltrow who is an American businesswoman on a trip to Hong Kong.She arrives home sick and she spreads it to her son.They both end up dying.The CDC gets involved and Fishburne,who is put in charge there,tries in vain,at the start,to put a lid on the quickly spreading disease.Gould,a doctor in San Fran,comes up with a promising cure route.In the meantime Law who is an internet blogger with many followers,is turning up his own heat on the entire scenario.He does not believe any of the explanations official are coming out with.In fact he himself comes down with the virus and through the use of a homeopathic remedy,cures himself,which goes largely unnoticed by the CDC.This inflames public opinion even more.He also is interviewed on national TV and accuses Fishburne of notifying his own family over the general populace.Fishburne then faces a hearing down the line into his conduct.<br />The CDC in the meantime is trying to trace ground zero of the virus.A WHO rep in Hong Kong is kidnapped and is held in a remote village.She is eventually exchanged in lieu of a batch of developed antibiotics later in the film.It turns out the batch is just placebos,useless.As the developed vaccine gets distributed,life starts to get back to normal for the world(until the next outbreak).As the film ends we see in flashback where the virus originated from.A bulldozer from Paltrows company knocked down a tree in which a bat was nesting.It bit into a piece of banana,which it in turn flew with and rested with on a beam in a farm shed,over top of some pigs.The banana dropped and the pigs digested it.The pigs in turn are shipped into the cities and one infected one arrives in the very restaurant Paltrow was in,in Hong Kong.<br />The film studies in detail how an organization such as the CDC operates,what protocols they use and how they become viral detectives,in search of an answer and a cure.They work in a logical and progressive manner,which to many would appear far too slow.As with many medical cures there are medical heroes,as there are here.The film doesn't just stop there,but shows the other side of the coin in the form of Law.He is an internet guru who many folks listen to and who slams the CDC and big pharma in general for being in cahoots.He cures himself and it is just left there.The director is giving as much latitude to the \\"official\\" side,as it is to the unofficial/internet.It also shows how our very own social and business structures slowly but surely break down as nurses and a myriad of union members stop working.This brings goods and material supplies to a halt,which in turn triggers hoarding and line ups.And of course this triggers small riots as people get less and less tolerant of others.It is certainly a riveting film which leaves one uncomfortable afterwards,as we see just how easy a virus can spread.But that was the goal of the director and writers,and they certainly achieved it here.<br />The film is in its w/s a/r of 1:78:1 and is clear and crisp.The only extra is a couple of minute cartoon-ish PSA announcement.<br />All in all a disturbing \\"realistic\\" look at the outbreak of an unknown virus and  how the CDC and their world wide counterparts deal with such things.Throughout we are given a disturbing peak at ourselves and the straws we grasp for in times of turmoil.It isn't pretty,but it engages the viewer.Recommended.ommended.

B003EV6DBM|5.0|The show's not hard sci fi so if that's what's you're looking for you won't get that here, this is the epitome of the term sci fi fantasy, wondrous worlds, the impossible made possible, action adventure, science that makes no sense great stories and loads of fun. A few years ago, I'd probably have given this a lower rating. Don't get me wrong I watched the show faithfully, I grew up old Who and I promised I'd stick it out for the new show if there was even a slither of hope for it.<br /><br />I'm happy to say from episode one there was way more than a slither. Yes from series 1-4 the ratio of good episodes and bad episodes were at best 6/13 in favor of the bad shows but when the episodes were good they were usually great. For instance, The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances, Midnight, Silence In the Library/Forest of the Dead, The Impossible Planet/The Satan Pit, Blink, The Runaway Bride, Turn Left, Human Nature/The Family of Blood all great episodes and other than that you have about four or five good episodes so out of 52 episode only about 17 are worth watching (not including Christmas specials), but the ones that are are superb.<br /><br />Then comes series 5 when the show got a new head writer, Steven Moffat (who wrote most of the best episodes of the previous seasons) and the new Doctors, Matt Smith. The shoe still remains uneven but at the most you have one or two bad episodes out of the rest are very good and then there's those special great episodes like The Big Bang, The Impossible Astronaut/Day of the Moon, Amy's Choice, The Doctor's Wife, and The Wedding of Riversong. Far more pleasure without drudging through the embarrassingly bad. The show usually moves along at break neck speeds, it can silly, or gravely serious at the drop of a dime just like its ancient young protagonist, you'll be thrilled by the adventures and engrossed in the human drama. If you're new to Nu Who (which is why I assume you're checking the reviews) watch the episodes I've listed first, you won't regret it.<br /><br />Sadly the with this first half of series 7, I haven't liked one episode, hopefully once we get this year's Christmas special it'll pick up.you won't regret it.<br /><br />Sadly the with this first half of series 7, I haven't liked one episode, hopefully once we get this year's Christmas special it'll pick up.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This movie is great!  It is a great sci-fi movie, and has wonderful side effects.  It's color and experience in viewing in Blu-Ray and unmatched.  And the 3D version, when viewing with 3D glasses, is even better than being in a theatre, with realistic video and sound.
B0053O89IS|5.0|From the very first episode its a really good tv eerie, its very interesting and you don't want to loose any detail from it very happy
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|one of the best in the genre.  beautiful graphics and intuitive  game play along with an engaging storyline.  I look forward to part 2!
B008WCP2PG|1.0|... for both Soderbergh and Matthew Mc-however-it's-spelled (I loathed this movie so much, I won't even be courteous enough to double-check the spelling).<br />  English language words have yet to be coined that would be adequate to describe what a reeking piece of cinematic garbage \\"Magic Mike\\" is.  Next to \\"Mike,\\"  \\"Plan 9 From Outer Space\\" seems like \\"Citizen Kane.\\"<br />  I won't even bother to get into this turkey's plot.  Because it seemed \\"written\\" in 20 minutes or less on a cocktail napkin.<br />  And the every-time-one blinked \\"dance\\" sequences?  If someone actually got paid to \\"choreograph\\" those \\"things,\\" well, good on you, mate!\\"  Because it was money for nothing.<br />  In closing, a few words about about Matthew Mc.  He played the most boorish, preening, nauseating,  full of himself character I've ever seen.  On film, or in real life.  Somehow, however, it didn't come across as \\"acting,\\" though.  I came away convinced that was the \\"real\\" Mr. Mc-whatever.  And, I suspect that I'm right about that.  Because I think a man has to take himself a bit too seriously to bother with washboard abs like that at his age.<br />  In any case, potential viewers beware:  \\"Mike\\" stinks.  And here's a good clue to that fact:  The one-star reviews here far outnumber those with five stars (so don't be fooled by the average and think this film is a three-star work; it ain't.  Minus-stars would be more like it.)
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I wasn't sure where this was going when I started.  I bought it because I have loved all other Mitch Albom books and this one did not disappoint.  Well thought out and an awesome message. Thanks, Mitch!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Th his series just keeps getting better and better! I can't wait to read the third one!! I know its going to continue to get better .
B005LAIGN2|2.0|I saw Red Tails in the theater. I've been a fan of works like Memphis Belle, Saving Private Ryan, Flags of Our Fathers, and other modern WW2 movies, and thus had great hopes for another historical docu-drama about the black fighter pilots of WW2.<br /><br />Well, the cast and action scenes were great. I'm not going to pick over the historical accuracy of the combat scenes because, heck, real world combat rarely translates well into a good movie.<br /><br />What bugged me - and your mileage may vary - was the plot, subplots, and dialogue of Red Tails. And I say this while being a fan of brainless action movies like Avatar, Terminator, and Predator, so it took a lot to hammer through my low standards. Red Tails took stellar actors and squandered them on the character-less characters (if that makes sense), trite dialogue, and poorly-constructed subplots. There's a love sub-plot that I could've completely believed, but the movie only delivered quick snapshots of a progression from first meeting to courtship that hardly explained how a black American Baptist airman managed to hook-up with an Italian Catholic woman in the bigoted 1940s. There was an alcoholism problem for one character that didn't come across well. Cuba Gooding, Jr., was squandered on a lifeless cookie-cutter officer who was a walking bundle of cliches (pipe smoking and lame motivational speeches). The white US officers who objected to the black pilots were also walking cliches.<br /><br />For me, this movie did not measure up to the great WW2 movies of the past 20 years. It had all the makings of a great movie about the US's WW2 black airmen and their triumphs against bigotry (and Ze Germans, of course) but, instead, only delivered very amateurish final product.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|another great app game from game circus!! i like it alot because its not complicated in learning  how to play and chalenges you with level upgrades the more you play. you also get rewarded for playing it regularly. i use it often as its a great stress reliever too!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love it. I've. spent hours with my son building his village and with all the updates it never gets old.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|I ordered a Kindle Fire HD for my husband for Christmas, and naturally, I wanted him to have a good case to go with it.  I anticipate he will use his new Kindle Fire primarily for watching movies.  Not only did I want a case to protect his Kindle, but I also wanted one that would stand on its own horizontally so he could have hands-free viewing.  The Marware Axis case does this and more!  The cover itself is very sturdy, and the Kindle snaps into a plastic frame for even more protection.  There is a horizontal display AND a vertical display, both with three different angles.  Since my husband is bit of a reader, the horizontal display should come in handy as well.  There's also a hand strap on the inside cover, so he can hold his Kindle while he reads if he so chooses, and the case is secured by a wide elastic strap.  I'm very impressed with both the quality and versatility of the Marware Axis; it does everything I wanted it to do and then some.  My only caveat to a future buyer would be that it smells a little funny.  I, myself, tend to be highly sensitive to smells, so this is something that may not bother or be as noticeable to others.
B002UXRGM0|1.0|If you live in the United States, DO NOT BUY this!!  It will not play on US DVD players.  This is a British series, recorded in 50hz.  US players are not equipped to read them.<br /><br />I downloaded the series onto my television.  The show is PHENOMENAL.<br /><br />Purchasing this Blu-Ray, however, should simply be out of the question.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|I'm usually a cozy mystery reader.  I picked up this book because I had watched the Walt Longmire series on TV and liked it.  I have to say I loved this book.  Even though it was a story line that was done on the TV show... it was so much more complete and interesting in the book.  Also, you get so much more in-depth knowledge about Walt's relationship with other characters.  And humour!  Who knew there was so much to giggle at while reading Walt Longmire stories?  I'm hooked.
B00899DR40|5.0|We are huge Bieber fans in my household and even the adults in the house like the songs from this album.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I'm not a Stephen King fan... but I picked up this book because I have an interest in historical fiction.  I liked this book a lot.  The whole idea of time travel has always intrigued me, and I remember very clearly the day President John F. Kennedy was assassinated.  That was my first exposure to a tragedy of national and international scope.  King's descriptions of things brought back memories of my childhood, and impressed upon me just how much of every-day-life has changed during the last half century.  I'm glad I read this book.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|After a few dips, twists and turns away from a very successful franchise, John Grisham returns to form with The Racketeer. Crisp , clean story telling and a few very original characters make for a fresh take on that tired phrase, &#34;page-turner&#34;. I seriously had a very hard time putting this one down. And while the ending was, indeed, very satisfying, I was sorry to see it end. If you like rooting for the underdog, The Racketeer is your new underdog!
B00127RAJY|3.0|Her show sucked. This program is a bit better though. There are much more effective solutions and options out there, however.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|I think this book might make a really enchanting movie, but I was disappointed in the book after all the wonderful reviews.<br /><br />The book begins with a well-known illusionist taking in his young daughter following his ex-wife's suicide.  He soon realizes Celia has skills of an illusionist too and he begins training her.  Another illusionist challenges him to a contest.  Apparently they have engaged in such a game before.  He takes in an orphan boy Marco and trains him to compete with Celia.  The rules of this competition are not spelled out to Celia, Marco or the reader.  Even the length of time for the contest is unknown to all.<br /><br />The competition begins years later when Marco and Celia are adults.  The venue is a night circus.<br /><br />The structure of the book was disjointed and confusing to me.  The point of view switched among Celia, Marco and others.  One POV was written in the second person.  I thought that unnecessary.  If there was a point to that, I didn't get it.  Worst of all, the years went back and forth from one chapter to the next.  I kept having to bookmark chapters and go back and forth to figure out where they were in time.  I still see no reason for the skipping around in time.<br /><br />The characters of Celia and Marco were uninteresting and self-absorbed, but I suppose anyone raised as they were would not be normal.  At first I didn't understand the purpose of Bailey, a boy who lives on a farm in Massachusetts  and loves the circus, but he developed into one of the more interesting characters.  As others have mentioned, the twins Poppet and Widget were entertaing.<br /><br />The circus itself had a magical quality and was perhaps the most interesting part of the book.  Those who love fantasy novels may find it quite intriguing.
B000S88JTS|5.0|This is a fun movie to watch -- especially if you enjoy motorcycles.  But, even if you're not into cycles, it is still great fun to watch...  This has been one of my favorites for years...
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Jamie is a farmer in Ireland who is lonely and depressed.  He drinks too much and depends on Valium to help him cope with his depression.  He was raised in a Catholic orphanage where he was abused by the nuns and priests until he was adopted.  Lydia is a lonely woman in another Irish town who was raised in a very religious home and is caring for her elderly mother who is very controlling.  In contrast to Jamie, she is extremely neat and does not drink alcoholic beverages.<br /><br />Lydia places an ad in a lonely hearts column which Jamie, among others, answers.  The story deals with their relationship as well as their earlier lives.  Their characters are well developed and I felt as if I knew them.<br /><br />The chapters dealing with Jamie's early years in the orphanage may be upsetting to some readers although the abuses of orphans in Ireland have been often reported by the media.  I felt that they helped me understand the development of Jamie's personality.<br /><br />When I started reading this novel, I wasn't sure I'd really like it.  I soon became came involved in the characters' lives and couldn't put it down.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|Most vampire or zombie movies are definitely in the &#34;B Movie&#34; category. This one is definitely a step above. There was action a plenty. And, well, let's admit it, there's even a reasonable metaphor going on here -- the slave owners as blood sucking vampires, and Ol' Abe as their slayer. So, yes, it even has moral worth.<br /><br />Not many vampire movies can claim that.
B005PK553C|5.0|you gotta watch the whole season. Great show and video quality great. The new season is not related to this one, but some of the actors are in the new one
1781163243|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo23WZDFIHM6I9V]]Halo 4 is back with a bang and this is an excellent video game art book for it.<br /><br />It's a large 192-page hardcover published by Titan Books. Each page is filled with lavish concept art printed huge, sometimes across two pages. There's a good amount of environment paintings that look really great because they are printed so big -- great for soaking in the ambiance. The environment paintings are easily the highlight of the book. I love the very physical look of the designs. And those with wide open spaces look majestic.<br /><br />Other concept art include designs for Master Chief, Cortana, Spartans, troops, Forerunners, weapons, vehicles and ships. They are all amazing and detailed. It will take a while to look through the art.<br /><br />There are several artbooks for Halo, and this is one of the best, and one of my 2012 favourite artbooks as well.<br /><br />Fantastic concept art book.<br /><br />Highly recommended for Halo fans.<br /><br />(There are more pictures of the book on my blog. Just visit my Amazon profile for the link.)
B002BU0DPE|5.0|First off, I've had this headset for well over a year now. I've never had a single problem with it, and I'm extremely surprised that it's performed so well through the months. I've read too many reviews to count about this product having some defect(s). I treat all my products with great care, and this product has shone through such care.<br />Of course, for roughly $80 you're not going to get a titanium pair of headphones that you can throw across the room. Admittedly, the quality is... Exactly what you'd pay for; it's almost entirely made of plastic that's weak. So it's NOT designed to throw, mishandle, or even drop.<br />The cord is extremely long which is an equally HUGE bonus!<br />The volume control has everything you need-- you can mute the microphone, adjust voice chat volume, game volume, bass, and toggle the \\"audio expander\\"<br />The sound isn't Bose quality sound. It's sound you'd expect from an $80 headset. I'm not implying that the sound is bad. The sound is actually very good, but I'm pretty sure for triple the cost (for Astro A40s, for example) it'd be put to shame. The bass and volume both can go brain-explodingly high (I've heard incidents of users blowing the speakers by having them at maximum settings). I use my volume less than 50% of the way turned during my play and am perfectly content. Sounds such as footsteps are directionally recognizable, improving your gameplay, but do keep in mind that having a headset on, no matter how good, doesn't turn you into a laser-firing Terminator. It just drastically helps and enhances gameplay, not necessarily making you a better player. Sound is definitely no shortfall for this product.<br />The microphone is very good. It's fairly simple to set up, and for ps3 the receptiveness of the mic can be adjusted.<br />Yes, you can hear yourself when talking so you don't scream into the mic while playing.<br />I could go on and on saying only great things about this headset. It's definitely worth buying, and for $80you cannot beat this value!!! For a casual gamer, I can say this is the perfect headset for someone like me, one who doesn't want to spend $300 on Astros or Sennheiser headphones.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: this product has rendered me loyal to Turtle Beach, mainly because it's lasted me much longer than I'd expect with zero issues and exceptional, performance and longevity.<br />(No, I wasn't paid nor has writing this review in any way benefitted me)<br />TIPS:<br />1. To make a handy DIY holder for this (or any) headset, get a giant binder clip and clip it on the edge of a table or surface, and hang the headband on the handle part of the binder clip.<br />2. To deaden the sounds of your P's and T's, and even breathing Into the mic, simply place a piece of soft foam on the microphone tip<br />Sorry for the long review, but this isn't a bad product especially for the price-- less than $100.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|Just love following the lives of these people. I could imagine exactly what the tijme was like for them. Wonderful series
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved reading this book.  I would have liked to read the name Jack at the end of the book.  Looking forward to book 3.

B000NDMRDW|5.0|I didnt want it to end every difficulty they face makes for a heart warming nail bitting experience there is nothing like it now it is my favorite movie.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Make sure you have set aside enough time to savor this great read.  It is an excellent suspense mystery right until the last page.  I started it on a plane and couldn't wait until I got to the hotel to turn the next page.  Great read!  Enjoy!!
B0076DCT2G|1.0|I have read several DeMille books that I enjoyed.  The Panther was not one of them. There was way too much narrative involving geography and history of the region and way too little story.  This will be the last DeMille book I read.
B008J34466|5.0|I bought this album expecting it to be a very good album. I however didn't think it was going to be so amazing. I love all the songs and have been listening to it non stop. If you can afford the deluxe edition I highly recommend it. The bonus songs are worth the extra money. Pink proves she is very talented with a very powerful voice.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I love to read Mitch Rapp character. A no holds barred kind of guy who does what needs to be done to get results.  Easy and fast reading especially if you can't put the book down.
B0091QSNEE|5.0|This is a really cute game and the graphics are great. I got bored of it quickly because it's a bit repetitive but my 5 year old daughter loves it<br /> and plays it every chance she gets.
B009X00E18|3.0|This case has a hard shell bottom and a folding plastic material cover (like the iPad cover).  There's a slot in the back that \\"catches\\" the cover when you fold it to make a stand but it's not that easy to do and doesn't stay put.  The top cover has a felt like lining as does the interior of the bottom/hard case.<br /><br />The case itself is slim, looks decent and has an elastic band to wrap around the front when it's closed.  It was easy to insert the Kindle and all ports are easy to access. FYI, this case does not put the Kindle to sleep when closed.<br /><br />What really annoys me is the orientation - when you open the case, the camera is at the bottom so if you want the camera at the top, the fold of the case is at the bottom.  The camera is at the top when the stand is in place. Will eventually get a new case when the prices go down.
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|For an action film this one is really great. It's a must see movie if you like action filled movies. Lots of action in the whole movie.
1401235166|4.0|Bill Willingham is one of the top writers in comics today, and his series \\"Fables\\" has won multiple Eisner awards. I fully believe that the recent Snow White movie, Grimm TV show and the other Fables-esque TV show were all created as a result of Willingham's successful and highbrow series.<br /><br />One can't read this in a vacuum. One must start with Fables volume 1 and work their way up to this. Most of the volumes are extraordinary pieces of writing: Willingham uses characters from the last 1000+ years of storytelling and is good enough at character development that we end up loving and hating a number of them. While each story arc is about 6 books, his overarching story arcs last for about 50 comics. He is a meticulous writer and planner.<br /><br />This volume focuses on Snow White and Bigby Wolf's seven children and the contests to determine which one will inherit the role of the North Wind.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|Great action filled movie for the family to watch. The grandkids really loved it. Husband and grandkids watch it all the time.

B00020HEG6|5.0|This is great movie, but said  story in the one. But it is a great family movie for family night. And to own the series.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|This was a great movie. It was everything I expected and more. If you were a fan of The Expendables, or any of the classic action flicks the actors had previously been in, then you will enjoy this as well. I do hope that they make another one, hopefully including more action hero's. They could add Jackie Chan, Russell Wong, Matt Damon, Michelle Yo, Peirce Brosnan, Harrison Ford, Tom Cruise, or Sean Connery. I think any of one of them would make a great addition.
B000E8N690|5.0|If you like Johnny Cash this is a movie to see. Shows you where he came from and how is got to where he was in life. Loved this movie.
B000002JNN|5.0|Good album, came on time. Everything was expected. Good case, no cracks. Good album music wise. No scratches. And came fast.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|This is a wonderful Christmas cartoon for the whole family. From Grandparents all the way down to the littlest one in the house.  It is one you would want for your Christmas collection of movies to own and watch every year.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|The intensity of the relationship really builds in this book although there are times where I can't get past the similarities to Twilight.  I like that book 2 includes a little more of a plot.  The writting in itself is much more clearly amateur in this book but at least it's entertaining.
B003NHRIUW|5.0|This is a great movie for the family to watch. A little sad in the end,. but it has a great story line behind it. Would say this is a movie the whole family can watch together on family night.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|While I enjoyed the story, there are just too many similarities and parallels to Twilight.  Book one and two were already overboard in repetive blushing and lip biting, so by book three you are so tired of reading those words that you wish you could read more about the plot than the scandalous things that go on in the red room of pain.  If the writer had used a thesaurus and vered a little from the overall Twilight story maybe I would have enjoyed it more.  With that said, I would still suggest you read the books if for nothing more than to amp up your sex life.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|doodle god is a fun game that you will find yourself playing in any spare time you have. buy it, you wont be disappointed.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Maybe it was the intensity of the relationship between Christian and Anastatia, maybe it was curiousity of the BDSM world.  For whatever reason I couldn't stop reading and bought the next two books before I could get through the first.  Some of the writing seems a little amateur but still made for a great read.  I would definitely suggest having an open mind while reading.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|See it! Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic have great chemistry. If you love shows where the leads are often at odds yas much as they work together, then give this show a try.

0307887448|5.0|Ready Player One is set in the near future, when mankind has pretty much given up on preserving the Earth and now spends most of its time in OASIS, a virtual world.  Wade Watts attends a virtual high school and is fixated, like most people, on one thing: winning a challenge set by the now-dead James Halliday.  Halliday created OASIS and became the richest man alive, and before he died he created a contest: to find three keys hidden deep in OASIS.  The first to complete the puzzle will win his fortune.  Wade is poor, lives in a trailer, and is lucky to have the basic equipment he needs to log into OASIS.  Without resources he can't possibly travel to the many worlds inside OASIS to look for the keys.  What he can do, though, is learn everything he possibly can about Halliday's history and favorite things, which all come from Halliday's childhood during the eighties.<br /><br />Unlike Halliday, and clearly Ernest Cline, I didn't like the eighties, and I don't have warm fuzzy memories of John Hughes movies, Cyndi Lauper, arcade games, etc.  So I thought I wouldn't enjoy this book, but I did.  Maybe because the eighties pop references are so integrated into a fantastic story.  Maybe because everything in this book was so intricately detailed, I couldn't help but be impressed.  Reading this book felt like you were part of the puzzle, because everything in it triggers a memory of something you forgot you knew.  Cline doesn't go for the super-obvious, but for the slightly, more obscure references, like the movie WarGames.<br /><br />If this book was just one long collection of pop culture references, I'd have gotten bored pretty quickly.  But it's not.  Wade is competing against all the other people trying to win this prize, and he's also competing against the evil corporation, IOI, which has employed people (the soulless Sixers) who spend their days trying to win this contest so that OASIS can end up under corporate control.  Wade and the other contestants are fighting to keep IOI from ruining their beloved virtual world.  They are working alone but you know they'll have to team up to share resources if they are going to beat all the money of IOI.<br /><br />If it sounds a little formula, it is. But the twist on the solve-the-puzzle, fight-corporate-greed story is this: it's mostly happening in a virtual world.  The cool thing about this book is that Cline really thinks about how his story goes in and out of the real world, and what it means if in the future, most of our interactions are through avatars rather than in-person.<br /><br />This book isn't Shakespeare, by a long shot.  Cline is either ripping everyone from the 80's off or he's completely brilliant.  Either way, it's a fun and clever read and one I was sorry to put down.keep IOI from ruining their beloved virtual world.

B0042MDAL8|5.0|The third movie in the Twilight Saga features Bella caught between Jacob and Edward.  They are both forced to work together to protect her from a group of new vampires.  I love how she struggles with head versus heart and how Jacob and Edward come to an uneasy alliance.
B009B4ZEKM|2.0|I was expecting this new album to sound a bit more \\"softer\\" than Bionic, but most of all I was hoping that this loudness war would be over, instead this album, just like Bionic, sounds really horrible. The levels have been raised to the max, the sounds is often distorted and really detracts from the listening pleasure.<br />It is almost shocking when I play Back To Basics, her last album to sound NORMAL, and really let her powerful voice shine through.<br />Lotus, besides sounding horrible for the reason I just mentioned, is one out of hundreds of generic pop albums published in the last years. There seems to be nothing special about it to make it stand out, it is actually worse and less imaginative than album released by unknown artists.<br />I expected more, and better.<br />Again, congratulations to RCA for lowering the bar on music quality once more. This album is aimed at audiences who usually download illegally and don't care about the quality of the music. But why would someone spend 14 USD on an album of music whose quality is the same as bad downloads?
B004EPZ07U|5.0|Slap this movie in you BRAY player grab fav popcorn and sit back and enjoy,<br /><br />Great fun for all that like DC superhero movies .<br /><br />Wish they had focused more on just the earth GL but was so cool seeing all the different characters from the GL corps.<br /><br />Now they need to introduce the other Lanterns . red,yellow,orange,blue, and violet
B001BANK32|5.0|I always loved the movie still the read is worth it for any King fan. Few suprizes here for movie lovers
0446580848|4.0|I am relieved to say that \\"the Panther\\" is a step back towards the quality of the earlier Corey books.  After \\"the Lion\\", which should be eradicated, I felt like it wouldn't be worth reading any more John Corey books.  Night Fall and The Lion's Game were great; Plum Island had great moments and was overall pretty good; Wild Fire started going sour, and The Lion... Don't get me started; see my review of it.  But the Panther, while having a lot of problems as a book, did not disappoint me as a Corey tale.<br /><br />Problems?  Two big ones stand out:  1, the Panther himself is such an obvious and inept bozo that  I couldn't suspend my disbelief in him having the position and support that he did.  2, the ending was rushed, trite, and lacking in any suspense or surprise.  Also, Kate was a little absent; and Bremner also was kinda there but not there.<br /><br />While these may seem like major problems, they  are not crippling to the experience because Corey is In good form, and most of the fun of the Corey books is in living inside his head.  So, this was not on par with any of the first four Corey books, but definitely not the discordant piece of drivel that \\"the Lion\\" was... My instinct was to say, \\"if you're a John Corey fan, DON'T read The Lion\\"; but I can wholeheartedly recommend that fans do read The Panther; and it gives me hope that there may be some even better ones coming.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I was really disappointed in this book. It kept me so interested until the end, and then I felt I was just hanging. It was just too abupt.
1401322786|5.0|I loved this book!!!!!!! I thought I would read it ''quickly'', but i had to digest every word. I could not skip one sentence!<br /><br />I made up the following questions for my bookclub...feel free to use these if you like them.<br /><br />The Time Keeper by Mitch Albom: discussion quotes, page numbers, and questions:<br /><br />Q. p. 52:  He cried that night for all that he had lost, but he would say it taught him a valuable lesson: that holding on to things will only break your heart.<br />Do you believe this is true? Support your answer.<br /><br />Q. P57: He could not escape the voices from the glowing pool, asking for days, nights, suns moons, and eventually hours, months and years. If he put his hands over his ears he heard them just as loudly.<br />Why do you think the author said that god made Dor hear every voice begging for more or less time? What are we supposed to learn from this statement?<br /><br />61: the sorrow of lost time became a permanent hole in the human heart...counting life's moments had led, inevitably to counting them down....in every nation and in every language, time became the most precious commodity. And the desire for more became an endless chorus in Dor's cave.<br /><br />Q. 72 however cranky or distant he got, she was determined to make the little time they had left more like the start of their life together, and less like the vast, joyless middle.<br />Do you feel that the middle of your life has been joy filled or joyless?<br /><br />Q.79 it is too late. The old man shook his head. It is never too late or too soon. It is when it is supposed to be.<br />What does the author mean? Do you agree? Explain.<br /><br />Q. 80 there is a reason god limits man's days.<br />Why do you think there is a limit to man's days?<br /><br />Q. 89. you don't need to do chores, victor always told her. But over time, she realized the tasks that swallowed many people's days only left a hole in hers. Gradually, she took them back.<br />Why did Grace need to do this?<br /><br />Q.96. they had kissed, a lot, and he had wanted her. SOMEBODY WANTED HER.  That was what mattered.<br />Have you ever felt that your self importance was ever based upon what someone else thought of you or did to or with you?<br /><br />Q. 98. in this cave, you will not age a moment... I deserve no such gift.... It is NOT a gift.<br />Why is living forever NOT a gift?  Could it EVER BE a gift?<br /><br />Q. 112. sometimes, when you are not getting the love you want, giving makes you think you will. (she was planning the gift to give the boy who did not pay attention to her after there time together.)<br />Do you think giving a gift can get someone's love or appreciation?<br /><br />Q.145. KNOWING something and UNDERSTANDING it are not the same thing.<br />What is the difference between knowing and understanding?<br /><br />Q.164. to realize his destiny, such movement had to cease. He had to stop the flow of time completely.<br />Can you think of time when you wished time could have stopped?<br /><br />Q.180. What you do next....it is still unwritten...in THIS moment, it is not wise to judge....<br />Q. The past is gone, the future is not here, only the NOW moment exists....what qualities or benefits does that NOW moment afford you?<br />Q. Why do you think god is saying you should not judge the now moment?<br /><br />Q. 188: When we are most alone is when we embrace another's loneliness.<br />Is this true? Support your answer.<br /><br />Q. 194. I was so lonely.... You were never alone.<br />Is this true that we are never alone?

With no loss or sacrifice, we can't appreciate what we have.<br />Is this true? Support your answer.<br /><br />Q. 206. there is a reason god limits our days...to make each one precious....<br />Is this true?  Do you think there is a god who limits your days?<br />How does having limited lifespan effect your daily actions and words on a conscious level?<br /><br />Q.207. ...once we began to chime the hour, we lost the ability to be satisfied.<br />What does the author mean? Is it true? Support your answer.<br /><br />Q. 207. there was always a quest for more minutes, hours, faster progress to accomplish more in each day. The simple joy of living between sunrises was gone.<br />Do you feel that technology which allows us to accomplish more in each day has increased the quality of each day in your life? Or in the life of humanity?<br /><br />Q. 215. we cannot stop what Heaven chooses.<br />Do you think heaven chooses for you?  How do you handle the things that happen in your life that you would NOT have `'chosen\\"?
B007EW9ISM|3.0|I followed all the materials regarding the design & production of the cosmonaut. As a marketing material, its great. Really made me purchase the product, chic,<br />The packaging is really nice,. Recycled cardboard very beautifully style, chic, with nice touch.<br />As to the stylus, well....<br />The weight is nice, the rubber coat with the logo feels quality.<br />As a stylus it's not that great. It misses some strokes which can be really annoying while you׳re into sketching<br />It's not very accurate, reminded me the expo for white board, unfortunately the iPad is significantly smaller...<br />After a while I felt its a bit too heavy. Some might like it,<br />i׳ll stick to either my bamboo, jot pro or the simple under 2$ stylus from deal extreme...
B004S4LAAS|5.0|Follett is a must read... once i started with Pillars of the Earth and sequels i found all his books very hard to put down. Jackdaws was no exception.
B000P0J0A6|4.0|Excellent movie from the 80's.  Great entertainment for the entire family.  Pull up a chair, pop the popcorn, and enjoy.
B007EECSFA|5.0|One of Morton's best (and I've read all of them and enjoyed them every one) - and one of the best novels I've read in a long time.  The story flipped back and forth between contemporary and wartime life - in a delightful way; not confusing.  The characters were truly believable and they were people you would want to know! Unbelievably good descriptions of war-time London - for the first time I could understand what it was like for ordinary people to live through the Blitz.  The suspense was so well done that it literally kept me guessing until the very last page.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love that im able to pin from other sites by clicking the share button in silk... Does everything i needed it to do!
1451650728|5.0|Being a fan of all things trek I must admit to a certain level of disappointment with many of the offerings lately as far as novels are concerned. There are a few exceptions however and this is certainly one of them. I couldn't put this down, getting a glimpse into the mind of Data's creator and learning of the history surrounding the good doctors greatest achievement was thrilling. I'm not one of those to offer spoilers but I will say that the end saddened and touched me. I definitely recommend this novel to any die hard follower of the star trek canon and David Mack is an excellent writer as anyone who has read the destiny trilogy will know. If I could make one recommendation though it would be to read Immortal coil by Jeffrey Lang first as many of the plot points in that novel tie directly into this one. Happy reading and Live long and prosper!
B009MF56GC|4.0|With the success of the first film, it was inevitable that a sequel was eminent. This time Sylvestor Stallone cedes the directing reins to one of the best action directors in the business, Simon West to bring a much broader and slicker approach to the franchise. Although the photography looks more expensive as the film was shot on location in Bulgaria, I still think the first film succeeds as a tighter fit. Thats not to say that this film doesn't work.  Everyone returns except Mickey Rourke and this time Chuck Norris joins the party with Jet Li leaving it after 20 minutes into the mayhem.  The one liners just keep on coming as the screenplay co-written by Stallone gives us a bit more character development but the real coup was getting Jean Claude VanDamme to give an incredibly villainous performance giving way to an explosive fist fight at the films climax.  The Blu-Ray released by Lionsgate is loaded with extras including a documentary on action films of the eighties showing why we continue to love films like this.  The disc is presented in a gorgeous 2.35 transfer in 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio to give your sub woofer a run for its money.  The other reviews say it all so click the add to cart button and be prepared for a 102 minute testosterone experience as Sly and Simon West rock your living room till 'EXPENDABLES 3' comes along.
B0017I1IZA|5.0|I love all the Stephanie Plum series Nd this was no exception.  the characters, the setting, the mystery and the humor make it for excellent reading.
B00908DDZM|5.0|More of a quick blurb than a review, but I ordered this CD for my husband since he is constantly playing the \\"Thrift shop\\" video. Great beats and the lyrics are insightful. At this price, it is well worth the purchase.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|I am about to turn 52 years old.  Having lost my parents long ago, I haven't had much experience, personally, with this horrible disease.  Unfortunately, some of my closest friends are living through the hell of watching their parents, &#34;live&#34; with or have lost parents to it.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone in this position, as it gives amazing insight to what it is like for those that are suffering.
0061537969|5.0|The Art of Racing in the Rain is a book that will grab you from the sight on the cover, of a dog's eyes peering out at you, to the very end, which leaves the reader (at least it left me)ever so curious for more! The characters and their behavior are real, as they are neither all good, nor all bad. Well, I take that back. There are a few \\"all bad\\" characters. In fact, I could actually feel the taste of disgust in my mouth while reading about two specific characters, and the way they just blythly go about their lives, with every selfish intention of making life miserable for Denny, an aspiring race car driver, and his \\"philosopher/dog/confidant\\", Enzo.<br /><br />Enzo makes the perfect narrator, since as a dog, he is often \\"all-knowing\\" and \\"extremely observant\\", yet for much of the book, very objective in his interpretation of human behavior, and about life in general.<br /><br />Denny and Enzo take us on a wild roller coaster ride (not to mention in the driver's seat) through their ups and downs, dealing with family (and who doesn't have their ups and downs with family?), tragedy, and stresses that figure prominently in Denny and Enzo's lives.<br /><br />But, don't be fooled! This is a novel of love, and redemption, which are the constant undercurrents of the story line. \\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\\"[[ASIN:0061537934 The Art of Racing in the Rain]] has a most satisfying ending, but of course, you do have to \\"race in the rain\\" (and sunshine) to get there. I laughed, I cried, but most of all, I really felt great admiration for Denny's uphill \\"against the odds\\" persistence!<br /><br />All along the way, as Enzo tells the story, his life is also greatly influenced by the behavior of certain characters, and how they interact with Denny (and him). For Enzo is the not just the narrator, but somewhat of a \\"Greek chorus\\" as the story reveals itself.<br /><br />I'm saving the part that really had a lasting influence on me for last: Enzo, \\"the philosopher\\" has a most moving \\"soliloquy\\" about death. Not depressing in any way, but it actually made me feel \\"comforted\\" myself, as he seemed to fill in the blanks in my personal questions about the end of life. And if any readers, like me, have had to face the \\"Crossing The Rainbow Bridge\\" of a beloved dog, (especially if they've been with you a for a long life) there is really great comfort in Enzo's thoughts about his own demise.\\"soliloquy\\" about death.

B003719GGS|3.0|Seems like Mr. Chapman copied much of his original book and then changed the pronouns to fit men.  Some of the paragraphs were not changed, so it doesn't make much sense compared to the previous paragraphs because he changed from a man's point of view to a woman's.  Even some of the stories were the same, which if you had not read the first book is fine, but the first book was much better for both genders.  Personally I could have done without the religious justification but perhaps others will like that.  The ideas are very good by themselves without religion.  I would recommend the original book, but this book...not so much.
B005ZO6NRA|2.0|Lots of action, but still somehow boring as hell.  \\"Conan\\" had no real charisma or reason for being a supposed badass.  In this version, he's apparently just born that way, instead of having spent years in training like Arnold's Conan.
B00428ZRFE|3.0|As far as image i LOVE THIS ALBUM! I though it was genius... she is constantly trying to come a new and out do herself. Its just is this her Loudest piece of work. Sadly, no! This LP is exciting. It contains different elements and gives the fans what they want as far as getting up out of your seat dance tracks. Its just too short and not well put together. The cd isn't really cohesive. Now mind you i am a die hard Rihanna fan, but this album was my least favorite. Don't get me it is still a good cd it is not bad, but the tracks could have been re-positioned better. I don't know how i feel bein the \\"Only Girl\\" one second to having a \\"California King Bed\\" the next. Get what i am saying? \\"Man Down\\" is a nice vibe track, but after seeing the video of domestic violence the whole approach of the song was unsettling. After grooving to it i sort of left it alone, b/c of that stong message behind it. My favorite track has to be \\"Fading\\" or \\"California King Bed.\\" Can't really decide. If your interested in Rihanna this album would be nice to have, but i would put it on shuffle. It isn't bad the work is well done and executed just a bad track list. Her image has never been better and she will be slaying her concerts to come with the music on this one.
B008CLI3TE|5.0|I had been looking for a new series to get into, and boy have I found one. One of my co-workers suggested Game of Thrones. I watched Season 1 on HBO and went out and bought books 1-4....still waiting on book 5 in paperback. I just had to have this on BluRay. Please help support this series, you won't regret it.
B0018S6YO4|4.0|For people who may not know Rihanna is the transitional Queen! Everything Rihanna does prepares you for a drastic switch of concept. \\"Music of the Sun\\" to \\"A Girl Like Me.\\" \\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\" to \\"Rated R.\\" She is always ready to switch it up and keep your attention. This cd was developed to push the envelope on what she can do! My favorite song being \\"Say It,\\" and \\"Rehab.\\" Rihanna has mastered the soft and hardness that every woman has. She switched it up, but still kept her uniqueness about her. The album blends Reggae-ton, rock, dance hall, pop, and R$B in one nice little genre of her own. She is really unique and has her own sound. I would encourage anyone to purchase this album if they are interested in her work. This album is what put her on the map internationally!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I think this book was better  than the first one.  I really liked it.  Next will be Nbr. 3 and I plan to read that one too.
B000EQ4G5K|4.0|\\"A Girl Like\\" is a very gentle turn from \\"Music of The Sun.\\" Which was a feel good album. \\"A Girl Like Me\\" is very sensual and soft. I think it is her most vulnerable album. This album doesn't try to make her seem like the victim, but it shows how she can hurt others as well as be hurt when it comes to love and relationships. This album has some up beat tracks, but it is really a cd to show her more exposed side. My favorite song has to be \\"PS (Still Not Over You).\\" While as for a up tempo song i would suggest \\"Break It Off\\" b/c her together with Sean paul is to die for. Yet, and still i really enjoyed this album. And if you want to really appreciate Rihanna's work of today you will have to dive to her roots. Once you get pass the first 3 albums the next 4 are a special treat. Her evolution is extremely unique and even though she switches it up she sticks to that Rihanna edge and sex appeal.
B009LL4LMM|5.0|This is a great app. I love it. Its a little bit like cut the rope but with bouncy strings.I recommend this app to all.
B009P5S11G|5.0|As a die hard Rihanna fan (which i say in all of my reviews for her) this album was not expected! I did not expect for this album to have this sound. You can tell that Rihanna and her team knows what people want to hear! She stays in touch with the youth on this album. She knows that Future, dubstep, and unforgiving rap tracks is what the youth wants. She adapted and kept up with what is hot, BUT most importantly stayed true to RIHANNA! This is exactly what i love about her. It still wreaks Rihanna, it still has that sexy yet soft edge! She continues to push the envelope. And i love her for that. Talk that Talk was okay, but not great! This album crushed Talk that Talk. Haven't jammed this hard since Good Girl Gone Bad. Not saying her previous and earlier has been bad, but its times when i want to vibe and crawl in my feelings with \\"A Girl Like Me\\" and \\"Rated R\\" and jam with \\"Music Of The Sun\\" and \\"Loud.\\" If you are interested in Rihanna you mos def have to give this one a go! Very memorable.
B008MEM24S|4.0|great fun whether you are a fan of the cartoon or not. Never played where's my water but this is fun all on its own.
B002UXRH10|5.0|I am a die hard Rihanna fan. Yet, this cd in particular is my favorite. \\"A Girl Like Me\\" has my heart, but as far as releasing a album where the last one left off was genius. Like i have said before Rihanna is the transitional Queen. She kept the bad side up. She doesn't just make a album to just make one. It is always a motive behind it for her own story telling purposes. Rated R really won me over with \\"Fire Bomb\\" (which is my favorite track off the whole album), but \\"The Last Song,\\" which is literally the last song *laughs out loud* is extremely epic and memorable. The tone of this album and the concept is clear and her most creative. She really grabs you and make you see the darkness as the light. Most importantly though she stays true to herself. The able still has the reggae feel, the rock, and the rnb vibe. She did give pop a break on this album which i thought was genius! She has a more island feel and multi-cultural thing going on too. And the newly added electric guitar is added in majority of the tracks. Anyways, if our interested in Rihanna's work you should totally give this cd a shot. It is definitely a fan favorite.

B009DTHZNE|5.0|The Cameron Crow documentary captures the intensity of Pearl Jam in the early years, along with the explosion of the Seattle scene. Crows creation is fluid and the editing is creative and visually stunning.<br />  The film clearly depicts Pearl Jam's relationship and contribution to other bands from the early '90s. The viewer gets to know all of the original members of the band, their personalities and artistic contributions. The film does an excellent job of explaining how and why Pearl Jam survived for 20 years.<br />  As a life long Pearl Jam fan, I have to admit there were a few events in the film that I did not know about. The film is full of different emotions and I laughed more then I thought I would. Overall, a must see for anyone who grew up listening to Pearl Jam.<br />  The extra footage in the delux edition is well worth the buy.  There are clips of members of the band creating songs as well as live footage and in depth interviews with all members of the band.
0785156593|5.0|Loved it. Great story. Best way to buy it. It would cost to much to buy all six comics. Awesome

B007QPFGJW|5.0|A great read.  More twists and exciting turns. Fascinating!  Nesbo knows his onions.<br />I still am agast at the unexpected ending.  Did I really read it correctly?
B0088RQ4X4|3.0|I did not see the hole movie to due to a family event that occurred so I really can not say much about this movie.
B000SEH13C|5.0|Vonnegut is a comedic/satiric genius and he displays all his talents in this novel. Once you start it is very hard to put down.
B008ASLNN2|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  However, some of the parts of the story was a little over the top but it is still the same quality as the first movie.
B0092MKFIY|4.0|I first stumbled upon these guys while listening to the radio.I heard \\"Its Time\\" for the very first time. I put it on my itunes within days-no computer availability at the time,I was on vacation;my laptop wasn't.A few weeks ago I heard the album in its entirety at Barnes and Noble. The only song off of it that doesn't get my seal of approval is \\"Radioactive\\".Sans that,I thoroughly enjoyed this album.<br />Hope my little review is of help to you.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|This movie is very fun to watch and is another good hit by Pixar.  Not sure why people thought the movie was all over the place but I did not have problems following it.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I have never written one of these before but I found myself having to after reading this epic tale. The book itself just captivated from page one. How the story shifts from present to pas him telling his own story of this life reminded me of a book I love; The Name of The Wind and A Wise Mans Fear. One of the most epic tales if you like reading fantasy, action and romance. It has qualities and twists you wouldn't expect. So I recommend this book to any book worm and I will definitely be waiting on the arrival of of book two.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I enjoyed this movie.  Good acting, good story, well worth the watch.  Not sure how it fits into the over all story of aliens since we also had the movie aliens vs. predator which seems to be missed placed now.
B0082A3HTQ|2.0|The soundtrack is fantastic; but VERY disappointed there was no information on the artists or composers on the insert - only the song titles were listed!!  My first time purchasing from Amazon, and disappointed with the product.  Besides the indication that the CD would be manufactured on demand, there was no indication that you would get just a &#34;no frills&#34; version.  Amazon, please at least respect the artists and composer and acknowledge them.  If you want the full version, I suggest you scroll down and buy the import edition.  I think I would prefer to continue to support my local CD shop in future.
B007UXSPK2|3.0|I did not see the hole movie to due to a family event that occurred so I really can not say much about this movie.

B0051QIGP4|4.0|There are some nice songs on this album, but over all I am not impressed with this artist.  It was free so I am not going to complain too much since I picked it up for that reason.
0525952926|3.0|A good read, but not quite as entertaining as \\"Fall of Giants.\\"  Perhaps it's because of the span of time covered, but the plot has several large gaps in time that I found broke the dramatic tension and continuity.  Mr. Follett also strains credibility a bit by having his principle characters at a few too many historic events.  But he makes up for that with Daisy's plot that follows several obvious patterns - then surprises us by taking an unexpected turn from the predictable.  More explicit and violent than the first, but the latter is at least justified by the nature of the material.  This question that lingers for me is why Winston Churchill - still just a passing reference, still doesn't fulfill the noble role of traditional American history.
0385535147|3.0|I'm definitely a huge fan of John Grisham but this book left me feeling a little put out.  It's just that the story became so unbelievable that I lost interest in it.  I hope that this was a just a momentary lapse of excellent fiction from Mr. Grisham.
B0090EJ99A|5.0|I went and saw this movie in the theater, and I recently rented it to watch with some buddies. Great decision. They all loved it.
B00845PT18|5.0|Very good sequel........... much stronger than many others.  The strength of Nicolas Cage as lead actor definitely carried the weight of the movie.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this its do fun and my sister is adekid  to this game.and now I am I almost ran out of batty yesterday omg
0316044695|3.0|To be honest this book is NOT well written. You might like it if its your first in this genre. And even then I doubt it. The first 70 or so pages are very boring. The training chapters are so so. There is no feeling in the writing. Its dry.<br /><br />I've read Warrior Soul and The Red Circle and this book is not even closer to any of those in terms of the writing. The other authors can definitely write, convey the feeling and make you feel like a part of what is going on with them. Not this book. There are countless paragraphs blaming the liberal media I had to skip at some points.<br /><br />This book only gets interesting when the battle for Murphy's ridge begins. So if you've read other SEAL books about the training and operations, I suggest you just skip to those chapters.<br /><br />For example, before reading this book I read something written by one of the SEAL sniper school trainers that the author failed his sniper test the first time, went through the training again and passed the second time. I was looking forward to reading about his personal experience on that but the author chose not to mention it in the book.<br /><br />Bottom line, the author is definitely a Warrior and a true hero. Just not a good writer.

B002QE3CTY|5.0|I was &#34;forced&#34; to read Maze Runner a few weeks ago but as soon as I started reading it, I was interested. The book starts out with a teenage boy (Thomas, the main character) wakes up and finds himself in an elevator taking him to a strange world, his memory of where he is, what his life is, who his parents, friends, family,are wiped from his mind, leaving him clueless. He gets to this strange world,which he later finds out is called the Glade, where lives only boys around him age that have been brainwiped and put in the Glade for the same reason: to find a way out of this maze (which they haven't been successful after 2 years of trying) before they're stuck in the alone world forever, never getting their old lives back.<br /><br />The author, James Dashner, does a great job leaving cliff hangers after every chapter, making you never want to put the book down. There are very unexpected twists and turns that keep you not able to guess what'll happen next. Just when you think everything is going to work out and you think you know what will happen next, the book surprises you and does something you hadn't even thought of at all! The book is sci fi, which I usually are not a fan of books in that genre, but I enjoyed Maze Runner very much. When you start the book, it may be a little confusing, but push through a little, and soon enough it'll pick up.
B00A3VLJCE|4.0|First, for those of you who tend to be 1-star whiners (you know who you are...) keep the following in mind: A- This is a ten dollar app for tablets not the multi-hundred dollar grandpa (or grandma) version namesake that is targeted for use on 'real' computers (desktop or laptop),  B- Think about the real-estate you have to work with (a phone's tiny screen, no way) before you slap down money and then cry to the rest of us about your judgement,  C - While this is not full Photoshop it is not your basic stickers, hearts and speech bubbles image enhancement tool either. So please if you spell badly and think you will get frustrated with an app that takes some brain energy and more than a 5-minute attention span to master, please back away from the apps Store - don't give the app a 1-star rating.<br /><br />Honestly, I suggest that anyone who is considering this app and who might be heartbroken over spending ten dollars then not being able to figure it out, first watch some Adobe TV or YouTube video tutorials to see what you'll be getting and getting yourself into. I think you will be ecstatic to see what robustness you can get functionality-wise on a tablet device for processing photos. Because there is always room for improvement I'm rating the app in its current form 4.5-stars. There are no earth shattering flaws that I've detected yet.<br /><br />You will be able to create layers to overlay and blend effects (for those who do not use Photoshop it is the moral equivalent of having a bunch of images or effects on sheets of transparencies then stacking those transparencies to merge photo elements in flexible ways - including putting people onto different backgrounds, blurring backgrounds, etc.), you can do traditional digital darkroom type effects such as burning and dodging or applying gradients or photo filters, or even convert color shots to black and white. Selection tools exist (reminder to those salivating in a post-processing high, do not get greedy, the app is ten dollars...) or use transformation tools. The one vital tool from full Photoshop I have not yet discovered is a Red Eye Reduction function - hey Adobe, what gives? Perhaps they assume all cameras now eliminate that satanic scourge. You can also transfer files between Touch and Photoshop (and perhaps Lightroom, but I'm a Ps bigot so don't know) with some restrictions.<br /><br />Sources for images to edit can be your tablet, Google, or your Creative Cloud account - your smart phone or other cameras too if you can get your images to your tablet with Dropbox or some other cloud-based program. I am hoping it is not necessary to have a Creative Cloud, Facebook, Twitter or any other invasive social media membership to get the full use of image transferability between programs. I'm still just dipping my toes into the functionality, so beware I may be back here whining myself if Adobe is playing games trying to force those who do not want to partake of privacy-draining social media to use such media.<br /><br />BTW, for those who are gadget freaks among you I am typing this on a ZAGG bluetooth keyboard used with my Kindle Fire HD. Much faster than hunt and peck. A great little device.
0385493800|5.0|The compelling story draws you in from the first paragraph.  The writing is crisp yet artistic, and the plot is superb.  If you read the reviews, you might wonder why some would give this novel such bad reviews.  Some expose their true reasons, however, and the issue they have is not the quality of the writing, story, or significance of the work.  It is the message.  While not a religious novel per se, it does extol the virtues of self-sacrifice, faith, and a disregard for modern materialism.  It is a powerful message, skillfully told, one the challenges the reader to look within.  What are my priorities? Have I bought into the lie that more will make me happier?  Am I seeking to achieve outward success, or eternal significance?  It's a flat-out page turning story, but beyond that, it's a story worth reading.
B009MF56GC|4.0|If you watch some of the &#34;extras&#34; after E-2, you will experience s somewhat telling interview by Sly.  He was more interested in character development in this movie than in the first one.  But at the same time, he was trying to spoof all of his fellow action adventure actors -- and there are so many used up lines scattered through the film it's almost torture (see if you can count them all up).  Ironically, what made the first movie so much fun is that it was all done on the fly by Sly -- he literally directed and ran headlong in to walls at the same time.  And it was great just for that reason.  He let all these venerable action adventure actors just do their thing around a loosely structured plot.  Coupled with the edgy motorcycle lifestyle and strange tatoos and jewelry it worked really well.  Micky Rourke's role in the first film -- and not repeated in the second -- was particularly interesting.  I enjoyed the second film, but it's just a bit too polished and too scripted.  Yeah, the group succeeds in blowing !@#$ up pretty much nonstop.  And Jean-Claude Van Damme is particularly strange bad guy.  But the slickness takes something away from the first movies grit.  It's still fun though and great to see Chuck Norris back in action.
B005LAIHYU|5.0|This movie is fantastic!  I was extremely skeptical, but everyone much watch it!!!<br />The action is perfect for a man, and the love of a first lady is awe inspiring for the woman.

B000MRAAJW|1.0|Upon receiving this dvd series from &#34;Second Hand Miracles&#34; which I read are out of Toledo, OH I found that NONE of the 4 dvd's worked in any of my 4 devices I tried them in.  I emailed the seller &#34;Second Hand Miracles&#34; and was told the cost I paid for the item would be refunded to my account.  I currently am waiting on that small price to be refunded.  I would therefore recommend anyone thinking about buying something from Second Hand Miracles, in Toledo, OH be warned, you may not get what you paid for...

B005K2YRVG|5.0|This sleeve is thick, has a nice lining and is fine for sticking the Kindle or Kindle Touch into it.  I didn't want a regular cover for mine so I thought this cover would be appropriate for just protecting it around the house and keeping dust off of it when not in use.
1451648537|4.0|Let me first set things straight!  I am not a \\"professional\\" reviewer with a view to sell.  Nor have I had much interest in Jobs throughout his life as opposed to most reviewers who appear to have idolized him since birth.  That being said, no one who is awake in the world could fail to appreciate the unique/elegant accomplishments spewing out of Apple while Jobs was in control and the barren productivity during his absence prior to his return.  This is what I call a \\"real time case study\\" and it convinced me to read this biography.<br /><br />The truly interesting aspect of this biography is that it was completed while Jobs was alive and most of his compatriots, friends/co-workers/enemies, were alive with fresh memories to share. I don't think the book sugar coats anything.  In fact, I feel Isaacson dwells too much on the bizarre aspects of Jobs nature. Oddly though you do gradually get a sense that certain - not most - of these disturbing sides of Jobs nature are in fact an integral part of his creativity/greatness.  The misleading aspect of focusing too much on Jobs spectacular oddities is that it tends to override the unique talents that Jobs displayed to instantly grasp the full landscape of an infant technology and recognize how to elegantly implement it for public consumption.  He doesn't need to create the infant technology and rarely does.  Reading the book in this light Isaacson provides sufficient instances of Jobs unique ability to spot great ideas and understand there complete future in a flash.  Not only did he see these futures in a flash but he knew how to translate that vision to his work force.  This ability coupled with an obsession for details/quality and unyielding demand for creativity from his workforce allowed him to implement his visions while also fulfilling the aspirations of the core of his workforce - a powerful and rarely accomplished feat.  Even with all his harshness toward his workforce, they learned to deal with that and realized/appreciated his ability to raise their own creative ability to unexpected levels. Don't we all want this out of our life?<br /><br />I have always been curious as to why organizations blossom, mature and decline even though they have all the financial and personnel advantages available to them at their height.  Jobs knew how to prevent this from happening and demonstrated that he could reverse the trend when he returned to Apple.  He could be brutal but it was the only way he knew to prevent \\"the bozos\\" from taking control of the company.<br /><br />So, Isaacson provides enough insights to allow one to glean where the exceptional greatness of Jobs sprang from.  It was not all goodness and kindness but don't be overwhelmed with these aspects of Jobs nature.  Look for the traits of his nature that made friends and co-workers idolize him - Isaacson provides numerous examples of these traits.<br /><br />Enjoy the finer less splashy aspects of the book.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Couldn't be easier or more fun!  I love it just as much as when I played it with my father years ago at the carnivals.  My kids enjoy it also...they run to play it after school.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this app!  its challenging but fun for all ages.  The only thing I would change is the number of hints. I wish they they gave you more hints. I felt that some of the levels are nearly impossible and I had none hints. But other than that I love this app!  You should really get this app!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I have mixed feelings about this book.  I found it very interesting and it grabbed me from the very beginning, but I was disappointed in the ending.  I've talked to other readers who felt the same.... it's a shame to read such a suspenseful book that holds such promise, and then be let down at the end.  It also contains ALOT of profanity, probably more than I've ever read in any book, and I read alot.  I don't mind some profanity, but it's obvious that the author's favorite word is F---, and believe me when I say it's used in every other sentence.  It got kind of sickening to be honest....
B00197U13Y|5.0|No one buys vinyl without liking or at least hearing an album first, so I'm just going to comment on the physical product.  As always, great and interesting artwork.  Comes with a damn ouidji board, too.  Great packaging, multicolored vinyl (red/black).
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Ok, it is John Grishan, right?! So it is well written, there is the element of surprise, it is page turning and you want to get to the end as soon as possible. What I didn't like is the end! It was not predictable, but not believable either. So many things have to happen out of luck, that I just lost interest.
B002LK0WVY|5.0|No one buys vinyl without liking or at least hearing the album first, so I'm just going to comment on the physical item itself.  Great album art, quality vinyl, great packaging.  Very well done.
0739378341|1.0|This book is full of under-developed characters. The only thing I can conclude is that Grisham wanted to write a book congratulating a blah-non-hero's ability to outfox American legal and financial systems. There were no &#34;high roads&#34; taken by any of the characters....the supposed &#34;hero&#34; is nothing more than a thief who can outsmart another thief. Really? This is Grisham? And with the ill-gotten gain, the thief-hero buys a yacht and sails off into the sunset with a new family. It seemed to be a mockery of American culture...he who dies with the most toys wins. If there is a hero in the book, it is the the lawyer's father ( a retired State Trooper)... He suspected his son had done something wrong. You've got to admire a parent who sees his own child realistically.<br /><br />I am left wondering what message of importance Grisham wanted to convey. If this book goes to Hollywood, they will have to produce some redemptive virtue in the &#34;hero&#34;
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This game HAS to be gamelofts best one yet...<br />(Except for Modern Combat 4)<br />Like GTA? Trust me you will LOVE this one.<br />Imagine GTA3 but with the graphics better and a bigger world with more possibiliteys...<br />Just get this game.
B0099G4Y26|2.0|Good but not as good as her previouse albums. More pop then rock then previous albums. If you like pink it is worth buying but wouldnt spend more then $5 on it.

B001N18HOG|5.0|This is an album that never gets old so when Legacy Edition came out I couldn't wait to get it. Holy sound quality!
B000PVAFT0|5.0|My 6-year old loved this movie. He's seen most of the child-friendly animal documentaries on Netflix and several on Amazon and this is one of his favorites. While the tone of the movie is a little sleepy for my taste, the photography is gorgeous and it introduces kids to numerous creatures not commonly covered in sea life films.
B002Q4TKAO|4.0|I ordered this DVD based on the rave reviews. I must say it is a great concert - very high energy and I like The Killers but I wouldn't say this is the &#34;best concert DVD ever&#34; as many others have stated. I have seen better.

B007ZBWJXI|1.0|really have no comment on the CD. It was purchased as a gift. Can say that item arrived quickly and in excellent condition which would be the most important aspects to my part of the buy.
140131046X|5.0|A truly touching story. I am very thankful that Mitch Albom is able to share the wisdom of a few remarkable men he has known. This book isn't just about faith, it's also about how we live our lives, threat one another, and treat ourselves.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This was the best book I have read in a long time.  It really made me think about time.  I highly recommend it!
B009PU2SX8|4.0|Diverse sounds and styles on this album. Soulful but not gimmicky. This is a talented guy. Rock and groove Blak and Blu.
B000056NX5|5.0|Dramatic, fun and fast paced retelling of the Greatest Story Ever Told! Singing and intensity was first rate for the entire cast. I found it to be both joyous and gut-wrenching at the same time. For those who aren't present in church every Sat. or Sunday, the message comes through loud and clear. The songs, you've probably heard before,  but come alive again!<br /><br />Glenn Carter as Jesus does a fantastic job of portraying a compelling, burdened, man with love for all, yet seeing, struggling and finally accepting the path that he must take. Judas, played by Jerome Pradon,from whose perspective the story is being told, is less the villain , and more the best friend who understands the worldly view and reality that they live in and wants to protect Jesus and keep on message so as not to call attention to the occupying force, the Romans, because he knows that they will deem them subversive and lock them all up or worse. He believes in Jesus and cares for the poor, but doesn't want to cross the line. He also understands people and knows that they will also turn on Jesus in an instant. Whereas Jesus sees the possibility in the people, Judas sees the reality. Renee Castle plays the role of Mary Magdalene. She is at once, worldly wise, sweet and madly in love with Jesus, while at the same time not understanding why.<br /><br />Buy it! See it! IT's worth it!
B0028IDXDS|5.0|They are lifesavers.  They are cute to look at, and fun for the kids.  Plus they really help the little ones who don't quite have the motor skills to put their pacifiers in their own mouths.  These are much bigger and even the younger babies can manage to push them back in.  And they're easier to catch before they hit the ground.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Love Sanderson's work. He developed this short story with depth and I really enjoyed each character and the overall plot.
B002MY9NF0|5.0|This movie has always been one of my all time favorites. Everyone should see this movie at least once in thier life.
B005TVYVI2|2.0|After less than 6 months of use, developed leak and stopped working. Loved using this when it worked, but not worth the price and won't buy another.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I just simply love it, it is fun and captivating! It will keep you going for hours, with a bunch of other fun episodes. And it has a kid friendly option! Gotta love it!
B008XG1X18|3.0|Love pinterest but I'm frustrated by how often the app freezes. Loads slow butci like the layout of the boards.
B007LGLKUU|5.0|I purposely began Amazon Prime just so I can watch Beverly Hills 90210.  I'm thrilled that season 1 is available, but I would love to see seasons 2-10 available as well.  Hopefully, they will keep adding the seasons :)
030758836X|1.0|Our book club chose Gone GIrl as our book of the month. Without this incentive, I would have stopped reading two pages into the second half. Both characters were despicable. but I must say the best part of the book was the end. These people got what they deserved... to wake up in their own little hells for the rest of their lives. I like to finish a novel having found some redeeming quality or having discovered something about a subject or place that I didn't know. Not true with this book.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Slow for the first 3/4 of the book.  Have read all of Grisham's books but would not recommend this one.
0385535147|3.0|I love Grisham's books and always look forward to the next adventure. The  Racketeer has a great premise and clever development of the plot. My disappointment is that Grisham spends much of the novel telling me what the characters are doing rather than allowing the characters to advance the story through their actions.. It probably won't bother most readers because the plot is engaging. However at the end I felt the author has told  me a story rather than creating memorable characters and taking me into the action. I'll still read every Grisham novel but I hope he gets back to the compelling novels for which he is famous.
B0041KVW2K|2.0|After examining the beautiful packaging, I was preparing myself to write a long, glowing, detailed review on my newly acquired box set.  Upon setting the stylus on the surface of the start of the first track on the first album, I knew I was in for problems.<br /><br />I have nothing to add to everyone's very well expresed disappointment at the lousy quality of these vinyls.  As I-and many-have said, yes, in terms of the packaging (the nice looking box, the gorgeous book, the nicely reproduced cover art) there is nothing to complain about.  In fact, its' very high quality makes the vinyl flaws that much more of a letdown.<br /><br />My suggestion is that EVERYONE (!!!!) return these.  Demand either \\"store\\" credit or a refund.  Let all the carriers of these albums-boxed or otherwise- get in touch with their suppliers and let them know that their product plainly stinks and noone is going to \\"accept\\" it.<br /><br />This, at any rate, is what I'm going to attempt.  Let EMI take its' garbage back and redo it properly...and the true fans who went for it the first time around will all probably gladly lay the bucks out yet one more time...but for ANYONE to accept these LP's with all the surface noise defects is foolish, unnecessary and plain stupid.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|The book gets going from the get go. The writer takes you to the surface of mars and gets you to fight for survival with the protagonist. The book was so good that I could not put it down. I finished reading it in one sitting. This deserves a movie or an HBO miniseries. Great job to the author.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|i can not stop playing it it is too fun it is addictive it is a great game i love it
B0083SBMBM|1.0|I'm confused. I bought the simple Avengers single DVD because I don't own \\"blu-ray\\" and don't care to. The whole point of buying DVDs, among my social network anyway, is to have access to deleted scenes and special features, outtakes and such. The plain DVD has none of that, just commentary. As far as I can tell, if you can't afford and don't care to own a \\"blu-ray\\" player, you don't have any way of buying or having any access to the deleted scenes or outtakes.  So now I'm stuck with this DVD of this movie I've already seen enough times, it's great and all but not worth $20 if it's just the same thing I already saw in the theatre. I'm really disappointed and confused and sad.
1423140605|5.0|I never read a single Percy Jackson book before April. Once I picked it up I could not stop reading. That is the beauty of finding something that has been around for years, you can just keep reading.<br /><br />I had to wait a few months for The Mark of Athena, which was not toooo bad. Now that I am finished, I am already dreading the one year wait until The House of Hades.<br /><br />The Mark of Athena groups the heroes that we all know and love (Minus a few for me). Grover did not show up, and we are stuck with Coach Hedge, who is not funny (Sorry!).<br /><br />After a grand introduction between the Greeks and the Romans, the team of 7 plus hedge, embark on the Argo II to Rome. In the traditional Percy Jackson style, they have only a few days to save the work. They stop a few places on the way for information and supplies, but nothing too memorable. This book was more about character building than the action.<br /><br />I do have to gripe about Jason, Hazel, Frank, and Piper though, as they are kind of \\"there\\". Don't get me wrong, they have their parts, but Leo, Percy, and Annabeth overshadow the story, which is fine by me.<br /><br />The story was also a bit predictable, but it was still fun to follow. The ending seemed a bit rushed, and it could have been much more drematic if the time was taken people who read the last two chapters know what I mean.<br /><br />Overall, it all worked and was one of the best books I have read.<br /><br />I recommend ALL of the Percy Jackson, Hereos of Olympus, and [[ASIN:B0090RI2N6 Sky of Dust: The Last Weapon]]!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I resisted seeing this movie in the theaters because I have a great 3D TV and figured I could wait. In fact, I'm glad I did. The movie is spectacular and the special effects come through brillantly on my TV. One thing I am really excited about is the movie is not shown in letter box format. It fills the entire screen of my widescreen TV, which is just fantastic. The sound is also great. Unlike some movies where the sound effects are louder than the actually dialouge, you can hear everything perfect in this movie and there isn't a need to turn it down when the action starts. It's very even and smooth, which is a plus. The 3D is also surprisingly good. If you have a 3D TV this is one movie you'll want to spend the extra money for.<br /><br />My only real complaint is the actual packaging. The movies and special features are loaded on top of each other, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but you'd think they could have at least sprung for better packing. Aside from that, this is definitely worth the investment.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This was a great site for purchasing videos.  It came to us VERY quickly and was exactly what we ordered.  Good prices, too.  Thanks!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|You should like this game because you get your coins back when you play more coins and you complete puzzles and get prizes to turn in for asome rewords.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love mazes and puzzles. I feel that this game is a great combo of both. It also made me understand something<br />about my personality. I don't always take the easiest route! Love this game.
B005NPCBI6|5.0|A Momentary Lapse of Reason was the first album for the group following the acrimonious split with writer, singer and bass player, Roger Waters.  Many perhaps feared that the band would falter without Waters who provided so much of the band's lyrical direction and album concepts. This album however, proved that Pink Floyd was not only alive and well, but that it would remain one of the most successful and popular bands of all-time.  It illustrated that Dave Gilmour is not only a phenomenal musician, but an intelligent businessman.<br /><br />The album is definitely more contemporary and accessible to the average listener compared to earlier works with songs like Learning to Fly and On the Turning Away being huge hits for the band. Yet while there is a gulf in tone between the previous Final Cut, the group has lost none of its musical technical brilliance.  Combined with Gilmour's soulful guitar work that is comfortable playing call-and-response in Learning to Fly, or driving the song in Sorrow, all the elements that make Pink Floyd worth listening to are alive and well.<br /><br />The concept album is still there and they immerse you straight away with Signs of Life, an eerie musical intro' in which you're listening to a rower pull their way down a waterway, a format that was rekindled in The Division Bell. The you're thrust into the uplifting Learning to Fly kicks you in a new directon.<br /><br />There definitely is less of the brooding atmosphere and cynical intellectual turmoil that Waters enjoyed exploring and was not everyone's cup of tea, but it's not all gone.  A New Machine parts I and II sees Gimour's voice enhanced by synthesizer and is especially haunting and forboding. And of course the last song, Sorrow, something of Floydian classic, which knocks away any chance you thought the band was all pop TV friendly.  The opeing guitar work was apparently recorded in an ice hockey rink with rotating amps blasting out Gilmour's thick, mournful notes.<br /><br />Definitely one of my favorite elements for it's richness of sound.  I love the instrumentals and yet in plenty of the songs there are snippets of throwbacks to previous floyd sound techniques found in earlier albums, with the use of electronic sounds and the spoken human voice. Buy a decent set of headphones for this one.
B00355L2TU|5.0|about Jillian Michaels. This woman, in 20 minutes, in my own home where I can totally quit whenever, just kicked my @$$!!! I'm about to be sick she pushed so hard. And not in any difficult moves, we're talking, jump rope, crunches, jumping jacks, easy things that a few years ago I would have laughed at. I want to die, but it feels so good to find something that I could do yet still you could feel it worked. Wow, I'm about in tears I'm so happy I found this video. Really, if you have amazon instant video, spend the 1.99 and just try it. Really, it WILL be worth it!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|The first of Ken Follett's Century Trilogy has given me more on the spot info about the Great War than any other single book I've ever read...and in such a non-didactic manner. I felt as if I were there in all the disparate scenarios...and I appreciate that...and look forward to  reading the next in the series and following the descendants of the characters from the first. I have read about WW2 in detail...but I know that I will learn even more from Mr. Follett as we go along!
B00A77II0U|5.0|This is probably the best game I have played yet! The graphics are fantastic! The story line is very spooky. The hints are very helpful when you need them and ALL items are large enough to see. Very very good game. Well worth the money!  Keep it up!!! We need many more games like this one! Plays well on Kindle!!!!!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is a good game. Its so close to the game at a fair. I like how you can unlock other games as well.

B007MB5OCE|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  It was funny, and well written.  I think the author developed his story well, flowing nicely from past to present.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I really enjoy this app. It's very addictive,  very easy to do. There only a few of them maybe around 15 or 20 but I still enjoy doing them again and again. The puzzle pictures are so cute.
B0067R0APK|2.0|The user interface is not that good. I would like to see the next few days forecast on the widget rather than have to open the app. Opening the app is slow and sometimes leads to crashes.  I do like that the app reports wind speeds.  Some other weather apps do not.  Galaxy S2.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so amazing but amazon deletedit from my cloud and it wont work at all so im reel mad
B001VLXNLU|1.0|Wow, Ive never read a book with such a horrible lead character. Zoey is so extremely annoying and immature. I'm confused by the 5 star ratings some people have given it. I'm guessing they must all be about 11. The authors shouldn't write a book portraying a teenager. It is extremely clear that they have no clue how teenagers speak andact. If Zoey was a real person, she'd be the most unliked immature ridiculous person alive.  Don't waste ur time on this series. Its incredibly awful writing. I think the authors need to take some writing classes.
1435122968|5.0|What a great presentation of Mr. Lovecraft's stories.  I finally decided to get rid of my worn paperbacks and upgrade and this was my choice.  I'm completely satisfied!  It's a handsome volume that seems like it will last in my library for years to come.  It's got the quality of a book that usually costs much more.  If you're a hardcore Lovecraft fan, someone who's curious about what he's all about, or a fan of fantasy/ horror, then this is the tome to get.  You won't be disappointed.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like it for those times when you have a little extra break.<br /> Easy to use and ideal for a short diversion
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I was so excited when this book came out. I started reading immediatly and loved it at every letter. Rick has not dissapointed me! The only part really didn't like so much was the end. Why? a)Rick leaves us with a cliffhanger and b)My personally favorite two heroes fall into Tartarus. Some people may have already spoiled it, and I intend not to.<br /><br />  Anyway, another one off Rick's masterpieces. However, I'll admit that I am starting to miss the young Percy Jackson. Right now, he's a lot more confident and cleverer. Yes, I do miss his flaws: doubtful, foolish at times, and also his nature to challenge, take risks, and use his crazy ideas.<br /><br />  But these are my opinions, and I hope other people enjoy it as much as I did.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|good but only lets you play for few mins. so don't get either get full version $3.99 or don't get.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Need I say more about this most exciting adaptation from the original books ? I'm eagerly await the next season.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Got it as a free application, and that 's what you get. If you enjoy finding objects...it's for you. As soon as I downloaded and began playing it wanted me to download updates for the graphics.
B001BPJJ1E|4.0|I went to a English public school in the 70s and remember my father taking my sister and I to see this movie. It was a lot of fun then, and on re-watching nostalgic and still fun!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Although it seems simple enough to play, I can't seem to quit playing it. I find the game relaxing. After I downloaded it, I played for over an hour. I kept saying, just one more and after i finish this level.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|Since I'm a huge fan of the band, it's no surprise how much I like this set.  I have other live stuff of the band, and I would not give them up for anything.  As if they were my children.  That said, this was a shock.  It's so GOOD.  Jason Bonham is there with the rest of the band at all times.  His playing is superlative.  As is the rest of the band.  What a great idea it was to do just one show and give it all for that one night.  As much as I'd like to see them tour again.  I can see the benefits of the doing it the Zep way.  I think all Zep fans would argue about the set list, wanting them to do their favorites.  But it's not as if there is a Zeppelin tune I don't like.  Nothing from &#34;in Through the Out Door&#34; or &#34;Coda&#34;, but at least two songs from each of the other albums.  All great, hard to pick a favorite child out of the bunch, since all are played brilliantly.  The sounds of the DTS is wonderful.  And what a treat the bonus DVD is.  In the menu I saw &#34;rehearsal&#34;  and thought it'd be just a couple of tunes.  It's actually a run through of the show and great companion to the actual show.  Slightly looser of course.  But what a treat.  The editing of the show is really well done, keeping things moving.  No leaving the camera lingering on the audience for what always seems like forever in so many bands live DVD's.  Something I've never understood.  If I'm watching a DVD to see a band, why are the camera people focused on the audience?  Well, great to relate, none of that here.  This is such a treat for Zep fans, and anyone just getting to know the band will be knocked out too.  Thank you guys, took you long enough, but you finally gave us Zep freaks something new to salivate over.  In a perfect world, they would do this once a year.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Although I have not read all the books yet or finished reading them I think it's a very good book I don't know why some people are giving it a bad review some of you aren't even good writers yourself some of the stuff you've written probably won't even get published

1451695195|2.0|I'm not a doctor. I have a Law degree from one of the top Universities in Australia. But I had to drop out for several years when my brain became infected with mercury from leaking amalgam fillings in my teeth, and I became very ill. During that time I had experiences which were as real as me typing this review, or dropping my kids off to school. But hard evidence subsequently showed that these experiences were false. They still clearly exist in my memory exactly as any other real event, but they never happened. I feel hugely embarrassed about claims I made - some to very important people in the community who subsequently confirmed for themselves that my claims were untrue. I would love to believe the author's story but personal experience tells me it may not be true.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Beautiful songs from the shows, wonderful orchestration, and a magnificent performance from Susan Boyle.  Her voice is just magic and with these songs she can create exceptional emotion. Wonderful!
B005JABSB6|5.0|Same glasses as shipped with 60' Aquos. Needed more than the 2 free, price wasn't bad and work great for 3D.
B006X5L6VS|2.0|Hard to work with and center up on devise. Isn't user friendly and wouldn't be something I would recommend to friends.
B000OY8NII|5.0|I did not watch the first three seasons because I did not have TNT on cable. But I started watching after a few ep into the 4th season do to the lack of good broadcast TV. I soon found out that Xfinty had what they call sreampix for $5.oo a month and the first 3yrs were on it. I really enjoyed the first season and I finally bought it, along with several Jesse Stone DVDs. Considering that Eureka and some of the Jesse Stone's came from at least 3 places plus amazon, I still got all of them in a week. Outstanding service from amazon and their sellers.
B004GYY714|5.0|My favourite part is that you can listen to local and international. My house does not get good signal for radio. Now I can listen to radio from Europe without a problem. :)
B0055SWM08|5.0|I'm absolutely addicted to this game. I love it! The music is peacful and relaxing and the graphics are beautiful. I thought at first that  it  would be a stupid tilting game, but I really like the original idea of the raindrop  collecting pearls. Over all, amazing game (:
0060245867|5.0|I sent this book to my grandson for his birthday. I hope he likes it as much as I do.! Laura Numeroff is an amazing writer!

B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Season 2 and the teaser has me dying for Season 3! I can't wait to start watching it! When will it start?????
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This knife is a beast. It is a very thick and very heavy blade, It also is made of very hard steel which can take a beating. its not the easiest to sharpen but it you don't have to do it often either for this type of knife. The handle is hard plastic and feels good, i have not had any issues with it slipping or anything. The sheath was the only thing I didn't really enjoy. Because the kydex snaps the blade in place it also makes it more difficult to remove and reinsert into the sheath despite the button latch around the handle. But then again, it is better to have a more secure knife than a lost one.   Pros- Heavy Duty, hard materials steel. full tang blade with a hard point of the butt end of the handle. feels good in hand.  Cons- heavy for a knife of its length. i would prefer a sheath that is a little easier to slide in and out.   other thoughts- not the sharpest knife but plenty sharp for most uses. i've read that the handle might not be great in wet conditions but i also read that that is fixed by covering with rubber of some sort. or replacing.  probably my second favorite knife out of a small collection.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I won't comment on the TV show because you can find reviews elsewhere.  It is the greatest show of all time.  No questions.<br /><br />The DVD's and packaging of this unit are superb.  Each disk has been viewed many times and the disks and packaging are all holding up well.  A high quality product and a must have for all West Wing fans.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is really awesome because you get to build like huge houses and make beds kill sheep mind diamond a lot of stuff like that.
B005LAII08|4.0|While Brave was a terrific movie, the bonus features were lacking. I enjoyed the 'extended' scenes, which were limited. I was EXCITED to see there was an alternate opening sequence, and then that excitement disappeared once I started watching it. It was partially complete, so in my opinion it shouldn't have been added at all. If you're going to put a bonus feature like that on there, then at least finish the job!<br /><br />Other than that, great Blu-Ray.
B006O6F932|5.0|Got it in a flash from USA being sent to Australia..Box was not damaged at all and again got it $70 cheaper on Amazon incl delivery that here in the shops in Australia..As for everything being there we are giving this as an Xmas present so haven't opened the actual High School Playset yet..I pretty sure that there will not be a problem and that she will love it as she has been asking for it..Once again THANX...D
B008NB0SQO|2.0|Watching The Muppet Xmas Carol (as well as A Christmas Story) is a favorite holiday tradition for my family.  I purchased it fully knowing about the omission of \\"When Love Is Gone\\", which didn't seem like that big of a deal to me.  Oops!, won't make that mistake again.  It was a total disappointment for my wife and 18-year old son and I felt like I delivered a lump of coal in their stockings instead of adding to the holiday tradition.  They picked up immediately that the song was deleted.  They both feel that the song is one of the most important elements in the story as well as being the most beautifully performed pieces in the movie.  My son was so disappointed that he actually stopped watching.  I guess we will continue on with the VHS version.  So if the song is important to you, don't buy this edition.  Otherwise the Blu-ray version is great to watch on a large HDTV.  5 stars for blu-ray quality, 1 star (or less) from my family for omission of the song, which makes the DVD and Digital Copy extra's sort of a mute point for us.
0425263916|5.0|Pre order this book after reading Bared to you, amd I could not put this book down!<br />Its a good story, with Love, Lust, Passion and Mystery!<br />Can't wait until Entwined with you... that i will pre order!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I had heard that Homeland was an interesting show, so decided I would start watching it when I was home sick one day.  I was intrigued by the plot and ended up watching the entire season in one day on my Kindle.  I would highly recommend this show; keeps you wondering as the episodes start giving you the background story.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|Once you get past the absurdity of the \\"idea\\" of Honest Abe kickin' vampire butt, you can sit back, relax and enjoy a well made, well-acted film that is quite historically accurate.  The fight scenes where Abe wields his trusty Axe-gun weapon are actually very good.  Trust me, you will not be disappointed on this one.  Rent it and then buy it.  Yes, it's that good.  Your welcome!
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I missed one episode, so I had to buy it on Amazon.  This is a great TV show, and I recommend it highly for anyone that likes good drama.
0446580848|4.0|Love reading John Coury's thoughts and comments; reminds me of my own thoughts even though I can't express them like he can.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|I am already through the fifth season on this series, and I am totally in love with it.  Violence, drugs, and even humor as you watch a chemistry teacher try to cook meth.  If you haven't seen this show, watch it...you will love it!!!
0525952926|4.0|Enjoyed this one as much as Fall of Giants, but had to keep referring to the family lineage in the beginning to keep characters straight.  Can't wait for the final book.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Can get almost any song or video that I like! Even if I don't know name of song, I can listen to the song before I download it.
0547564651|5.0|Intelligence will only get you so far in life. This is probably obvious to anyone who has known (or been!) an under-achiever or has known someone who succeeded despite modest intelligence. But author Paul Tough goes a step further in explaining why this is -- and what other -- malleable -- traits help lead to success. He looks at how optimism, responsibility, curiosity, and most importantly grit -- help people succeed, and how experiences at both ends of the socioeconomic scale derail people from fulfilling their potential. A lack of love and support early in life leads to hopelessness, poor impulse control, and a slew of life-long negative effects. But a lack of challenge and experience of success-despite-previous-failure makes people risk-adverse and gritless.<br /><br />In other words, the findings Tough presents have repercussions for a sizable slice of the population -- from the resource-poor to helicopter parents. This book appealed to me as a parent, a citizen interested in education policy, and a 30-something interested in understanding more about my development, as well as my peer's. Tough presents a series of studies and anecdotes that show what matters and why, and suggest possible interventions to strengthen children's characters.<br /><br />In his examination of what makes great chess players great, Author Tough mentions people's tendency towards confirmation bias -- looking at data in the way that is most supportive to their original position and ignoring data that is contradictory and doesn't fit. I fear that, in reporting on the numerous studies in various disciplines, the author has fallen to the same malaise -- biochemical research is rarely cut and dry, and social, psychological, and economic research even less so. In other words, I suspect the truth about the power of grit, optimism, etc. is much more complicated and confounding than Tough makes it out to be -- and the potential solutions to increasing success likewise more convoluted. That should not diminish from the value of this book, however, which presents important information we should all consider in thinking about how to shape the path towards our children's future.
B0084IG8TM|2.0|Twilight doesn't have as broad of an audience as the Hunger Games, primarily due to the fact that Twilight is much more based on a love story with a bunch of hot guys, so the audience isn't nearly as broad as the Hunger Games, for obvious reasons. The Hunger Games is based more on action and violence. If you enjoy watching 12-18 year old children slaughtering each other, than The Hunger Games is for you, but I strongly advise you read the book first, otherwise you will only get a superficial understanding of the depth of the characters, as well as the entire point of the reason for The Hunger games & why some names are entered to be picked forcibly to compete in the hunger games, more than others. They address this issue in the movie, but offer no explanation for the reasons why. I read the book and watched the movie to be open-minded to giving it a chance. It is an entertaining movie, despite the wide gap of the ages of the CHILDREN being forced to kill each other, which is obviously ridiculous to expect a 12 year old, whose name has just been entered 1 time in the lottery to be randomly drawn during the reaping, a 13 year olds name is entered twice, a 14 year olds name is entered 3 times, and so on, to win the hunger game. So therefore, there are far more older children's names entered in the lottery to be picked out to be put in the hunger games. There are also other reasons the children's names are entered into the lottery more frequently, which is mentioned in the movie, but without any explanation why.  It has a touch of a love triangle to it, unlike The Twilight Saga which is primarily based on a love triangle, which comes together perfectly in the end, it's not a simple love/love triangle story. It actually isn't much of a love triangle, because the main character, Bella, clearly knows who she wants to be with throughout the entire saga. The third main character is her best friend, whom happens to be in love with her, but she's not in love with him. Anyway,The Hunger Games clearly is doing what Twilight did in terms of the concept of a love triangle, the last book being broken up into 2 movies, and to simply just capitalize on releasing the film right around the time The Twilight Saga is coming to it's conclusion, so fans are ready to fall in love with another love story, like Twilight, under nearly impossible circumstances for the lovers to be together, which makes for a far more interesting love story. So copying The Twilight Saga to make billions of dollars, putting children in a unrealistic age group; in a life or death situation, and doing a poor job of understanding the movie without having read the book, The Hunger Games is a little ridiculousa & lacks depth necessary to know what is going on in the movie, & is a total cop off of The Twilight Saga. The Hunger Games is worth watching, but don't expect it to be all it's been hyped up to be.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Easy to read and follow the main characters.  It hard to put it down each evening.  No clue as to the true ending untll you actually finished the last chapter.
159420411X|2.0|I'm a member of SABR, a fan of Silver's political blog, and as an atmospheric science professor I teach seminars on forecasting (weather forecasting and also an interdisciplinary seminar in prediction).  I've won awards in a national weather forecasting contest, too.  I thought this book would be the long-awaited grand unifier of the field of prediction.  Instead, any time that Silver turns from his areas of expertise toward science, he faceplants.<br /><br />Chapter 4: Nate thinks the U.S. weather forecast models are run on computers in Boulder, CO--completely wrong, total confusion of a research lab with the operational forecasting center in Maryland.  He doesn't understand the complex interplay of models and data in weather forecasting, even though the previous chapter on baseball scouting is a perfect setup for it.  He misdescribes what a nonlinear equation is.  He misdescribes Ed Lorenz's famous chaos theory experiments.  By the end of Ch. 4, he can't even spell \\"television\\" correctly.  While he is complimentary of weather forecasters, he misses numerous connections with earlier chapters and really doesn't seem to understand the subject matter.  (At least he doesn't think weather forecasting = Al Roker.)<br /><br />But this is considerably better than his chapter on climate prediction (Ch. 12), in which he completely, utterly botches the definition of the greenhouse effect--he thinks it has to do with reflected solar radiation.  At that moment, he loses all credibility... it's as if he were a scientist discussing sabermetrics in the Baseball Research Journal and referred to a baseball as \\"the pigskin.\\"  Total fail.  (He cites a couple of URLs in this passage, including lecture notes from a Columbia/Barnard course I used to teach.  The quickie-Wiki approach to becoming an 'expert' in a field.  The URLs sound good, but clearly Silver learned zero about the greenhouse effect from them--zero.)  Then Silver sets up a false comparison between a discredited HeartlandInstitute forecaster and the worldwide efforts of the IPCC... fail.  He skims the whole world of climate modeling.  By chapter's end, he basically comes off as a college freshman out of his depth, writing a term paper the morning it's due.  He'd know more about climate forecasting if he read Ch. 16 of my college-level intro meteorology textbook, but apparently there was no time for anything that pedantic.<br /><br />Silver's Acknowledgments seem to reveal the problem: his research assistant seems to have been mostly responsible for the science parts of the book.  In retrospect, it's not hard to tell (from the depth of thinking and analysis, from the lack of proofreading, etc.) that Silver didn't care much about the science chapters in his book--a couple hours with a couple experts, some URLs provided by the researcher, that's plenty for him.  If Nate were in my freshman Intro to Weather and Climate class, he'd miss a lot of questions on the final exam.<br /><br />I like a lot of Silver's big-picture perspectives on forecasting, and his discussion of Bayesian statistics is illuminating, but his lack of follow-through in the scientific fields where forecasting has been explored most successfully has seriously undermined his book.  Somebody tell the New York Times that \\"The Signal and the Noise\\" is *not* one of the momentous books of the decade.  Instead, it's yet another example of a book that grew out of a blog but needed to stay in the oven a while longer.  Hey, Penguin Press, don't publishers hire expert content reviewers (not to mention copy editors) anymore?
B005LAIIFS|4.0|You probably expect to see Santa at Christmas, but the Easter Bunny? Why not. Rise of the Guardians is a fun, behind-the-scenes look at the brotherhood of mythical creatures who protect and bring joy to children. In a way, their protection of kids is for their own good, too: they need the belief of kids in order to survive.<br /><br />There are fun moments in the movie: we learn that the Yeti make the toys at the North Pole, instead of elves. In a funny clip during the end credits, we even learn the one of the Yeti's given names is \\"Phil.\\" Sandman is one of the funniest characters in the film, despite being mute.<br /><br />There are also scary moments: The Boogieman sends nightmares into the world in an attempt to take away children's hope. He is visually striking: nearly monochromatic in an otherwise colorful world, and accompanied by swarms of black horses worthy of the Ringwraiths.<br /><br />*Spoiler Alert*<br /><br />There is hope: Children are able to defeat the Boogieman by facing and acknowledging frightening circumstances, and choosing not to be afraid of them. This is where the \\"wishful thinking\\" part of my title comes in. Bravery is a good virtue to commend to children, but some kids have been through traumatic circumstances in real life. They might not be able to just \\"choose\\" not to be afraid.<br /><br />*end of spoiler*<br /><br />Overall, Rise of the Guardians is a fun movie; it's worth your time, and will probably make your young kids laugh, shriek, and laugh again. Just make sure you're there for the scary parts.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Overall a very great game. A little confusing to get the hang of building the crazy contraptions, but very challenging and fun.
