B005GY0Y8S|5.0|I am looking forward to reading more books by this author as it kept my interest and had a good plot.  I also learned some French!
B001706I5I|4.0|We really enjoyed this as a family. Jim Carrey is hilarious as usual. I also liked that it was very clean.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|Movie was not what I expected.  I was expecting a little more forward humor, but many times was left a little sleepy.  Must admit I was not familiar with the original series so it could be my fault for expecting too much.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Vince Flynn is one of my favorite authors and his characteer Mitch Rapp is intriguing. I look forward to the next book particularly want to see if it will incorporate two new characters into the team.
B007HACDLK|4.0|The novel, like all his other books, is full of action and the good guys always prevail. Had a bit of hard time with the agent who planned his own brutal beating. Wasn't believable to me. I wish, hope we have in our government, people like Mitch Rapp to take whatever means to protect us against an enemey determinded to bring our government down. When I finish one of Vince Flynn novels always want to know when the next one will be coming out.
B00A6N8F4Y|1.0|Sex, drugs and violence, what a surprise! I can't believe John Travolta stupped so low to be in a movie. I am sorry I rented this video and wasted my time. It was terrible!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love the graphics and the timed game plan.  The ads are easy to skip and doesn't slow it down.
1439156816|5.0|I've read a couple of books on writing over the past few months, \\"How to Write a Damn Good Novel,\\" \\"This Year You Write Your Novel,\\" \\"How to Write What You Want And Sell What You Write,\\" and a couple others, and they all had tons of great tips and guidelines for writing plot, character development, conflict, story arc, getting published, etc. A lot of them were repeats from the others in certain sections, but good nonetheless. This one by Stephen King is my favorite so far. It's not as \\"religious\\" and strict about the rules, which is something that started messing with me while trying to write after reading those other books, because instead of letting the story naturally tell itself like I've always done, I started trying to forcibly tell the story; and force is always obvious. I started trying to abide by all of those rules and guidelines I had learned, which, they are good rules and guidelines to help you keep a professional appearance, but I had let them become too much of the focus, so my imagination when writing started losing it's innocence at the same time. That's not to imply anything bad about those other books, it is simply an observation of how I applied what I read from them.<br /><br />This book is really practical and honest, and it helped me get my imagination back on track, without feeling like it was \\"wrong\\" if I didn't have everything mapped out before I began writing (which has never worked for me, and so it got to be a bit stressful). By the time I got a quarter of the way through, I felt like I knew the author as a close friend, almost like reading a really well written fiction book where you just want to know more and more about the main character and the world they live in. I had completely forgotten it was a book about writing until I ended up in that section.<br /><br />It took almost half of the book to get to the part about writing (most of the first half was a memoir, which alone is worth reading), and when it did, an already amazing book turned into... whatever the next best word after amazing is.<br /><br />If you're doing or planning on doing any kind of fiction writing, maybe non-fiction too, this book is definitely one to read.k turned into... whatever the next best word after amazing is.<br /><br />If you're doing or planning on doing any kind of fiction writing, maybe non-fiction too, this book is definitely one to read.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This is a challenging game.  It is fun and makes for a great evening of entertainment. Would recommend but not for a younger child.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|As a beginner to this game I liked the ease of the layouts and the ability to redo them when I get stuck. I also love the different levels (who knew there were levels?) Thanks for the product! Love it.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Good book Have always loved the author she is a great writer love the characters this book has an awesome story line
B009GEEMLY|5.0|This is one of the greatest Super Hero movies made to date besides the latest Batman.  Definitely recommend this for everyone!!!!!
B008Z9L94O|1.0|Unfortunately, I had to return this box set as there were some major issues with the sound on it. Usually I can overlook some flaws, but this was too much especially for the price. I thought it was my turntable at first, but after playing with the adjustments I got nowhere. After reading the reviews online, they say exactly what I am experiencing- distortion on many of the songs (almost clipping), especially the louder guitar driven ones which seemed to affect the right channel mostly, poor stereo imaging and overall noisy vinyl. They also cranked up the loudness way too much for this pressing. My friend has an original pressing and we compared them. Too bad, great packaging and all, but for $80 not worth it. Hope they fix these issues and I will certainly get it again!
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|This movie was very cool and gritty.  Definitely recommend it for crime thriller enthusiast. Not recommended for children under 17.
1449433251|5.0|This is a must-have for any person, any age. Calvin and Hobbes has always been a favorite, all the way from my childhood to now. Get it now!!!!!!!!
B009KHDT0C|4.0|Loved it! Great movie if u wanna watch a comedy. I love the dry humor and ridiculous yet funny story line.
0316069434|5.0|Michael Connelly continues to amaze me with his insights into what readers want. This novel involves Harry at his best (which of course means at his worst to his superiors) and doggedly sticks to a case that the average 'cold case' detective would abandon in a heartbeat.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|There are things called &quot;bling&quot; and its a currency partially required to continue the game. GOTTA GET MONEY TO BUY IT
B009G78EE2|5.0|Fun but not stupid. Sick beats. Lyrics are from the heart. Guest artists are amazing. New favorite artist for sure.
B0010Z32OA|4.0|I admit, I'm biased: I came into this movie loving the book by Neil Gaiman.  Of course, no movie is ever as good as the book; but as adaptations go, this one was one of the better ones.
B009OCR1X4|5.0|I don't buy many soundtracks, because mainly a lot of the music sounds the same. But Cloud Atlas' score is amazing. It has a unique sound that when you here it you know what it is. Beautiful mix. I love the use of piano and strings. Complemented the movie well.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Such a fabulous and creepy show! I love the newest season, and I cannot wait to see what new twists and turns the writers will implement!
B006M4RN3U|4.0|Not much needs to be said about Fun.'s Some Nights that hasn't already been said. They've garnered enough fans and people have noticed their talent and ability. Overall this is a solid album. The best songs are the ones they've released as singles, the others are still good or okay. I have a feeling as I listen to them more these okay songs will grow on me.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I am a very light sleeper and my husband snores. I have slept so much better since I started using this app. I fall asleep easier and sleep much more soundly. I used to leave the TV on for background noise and I used to toss and turn though the night and get up several times. I've been using this for about 2 weeks and feel so much better rested. I love that you can create your own sounds and set the volume of each sound within the set. It took me a little bit of playing around to figure it out but it's not hard. I have this loaded on my Kindle Fire and just start it when I'm ready to go to sleep. It's also on my phone and works fine there too, however the sound quality seems better on the Kindle.<br />I really can't imagine anyone being disappointed in this app.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|Before purchasing I read the recommendations and alot of people were not happy with the product once they received it BUT I really like the cover. It's light but protects the Kindle Fire perfectly. I also really like how you can make it into a stand. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a affordable decent cover.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I really like how I can be reading a book on my Kindle Fire and then if I'm in a waiting room or something and open up this app on my phone, it will ask me if I'd like for it to go to the page where I last was on my Kindle Fire. That's cool!<br />I think it's a great app, easy to use on both devices.
B0031RS4UM|5.0|I do so like the Reacher stories they ae so not like my run of the mill life.  a gentle man who comes to the aid of most ladies.  helps out people but ensues they do not take advantage of him,  and makes the ones who do him wrong regret into the future or forever
B009FB3XTA|5.0|The best ever. Loved the books and the movies; however, Breaking Dawn 2 was the Best. Awesome. Over all expectations.
B009VB97EY|2.0|The only good thing about this movie and the half naked men. The plot is terrible and boring. I didn't expect much from this movie but it was worse than I even thought it could be
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This is one of my favorite Hoildays movie and it look great in Blue ray I recommend this to all family with young children We used to watch this as a family and my kids are adults now and this is one that they watch with there own kids now
B000AY74OG|5.0|I purchased b/c we loved it when it was first released, we decided we want to buy it...Always a hit with my kids!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|pretty good for YA reading.  I am an avid reader from day one.  This trilogy kept my attention although I did figure out the end before I got there.
0316228532|5.0|This book was a surprise birthday present from my husband and I must admit I approached it with trepidation since I had already read the mostly mixed reviews it had received.  I am about a third of the way through and I have to say that it only took me about 20 pages to fall absolutely head over heels for it.  I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!  As someone who has read the books of Christopher Buckley (Thank You For Smoking, etc.) and Carl Hiaasen (Skinny Dip, etc.), I can tell you that this book is probably not for everyone, but if you enjoy your humor as black as a moonless night in the desert - then this book is for you.  Also, an appreciation of dry English wit would go a long way.  If this is the direction Rowling is taking, I can't wait for the next novel.  And yes, I was a huge fan of HP and read every last one of them.  I never expected this would be along those lines since it's for adults and anyone who reads this book with that notion needs to grow up.<br /><br />Okay that's my 2 cents :-)
B005TBWN0K|5.0|This App is over the top.  It offers you so much flexibility and provides you the ability to bring things to a whole new level.
B000286RKW|5.0|The sequel to Casio great service price and deliver would look to use them again  ordering on line is easy
B000YHG72E|5.0|I watch this movie every Christmas and sometimes throughout the year if I just need a good laugh. Funny movie that is good for kids and adults alike.
B001AQR3IU|5.0|A wonderful movie.  Enjoyed this so much. It worth the purchase !!!<br />A wonderful adventure with exciting expectations.<br />Worth watching!!
B001TH16DI|5.0|This is the third set of the Star Trek collection.  First the VHS, then DVD, now Blue Ray.<br />Good stuff
B008ASLK8A|4.0|I love how this movie same as the previous got to the true Sherlock Holmes while keeping it safe for family's. This one was more violent as it was about WWI and the death of Holmes and Moriarty.  So I wouldn't recommend it for smaller children but for teenagers it would be perfect.
B0073XORCY|5.0|just went to the Ian Anderson TAAB2 concert and had to have the album.  Very enjoyable bought the deluxe with DVD, great sound
B009FZHYKU|5.0|One of the best shows on TV.  You never know what is going to happen next and I can't wait for the remainder of Season 3.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is still a good challenge to adults.  It isn't so difficult that it can't be done.  Thank you
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|One of the reasons I remain such a fan of Clancy is the fact that I have followed numerous characters from the inception of John Patrick Ryan until now, along with numerous other complicated characters.  Whenever I pick up the next Clancy thriller, it is a family reunion of sorts, and its like catching up with everyone.  But Clancy can spin a tail like no one else, and you find yourself engrossed in the complicated plot, character, and story lines all the way until the end, when you start calculating when the next book will be out so you can find out what happens next.
B00280LYIM|4.0|This volume in the Percy Jackson series really takes you to dark places.  The Labyrinth is terrifying and exciting.  I  stayed up late most nights for the inability to simply put it down.  My husband suffered the same syndrome as he read it.
B007HACDLK|5.0|In Mitch Rapp, Vince Flynn has created the quintessential American hero.  If you are accustomed to reading politically correct claptrap, than Vince is not your author, as he pulls no punches as far as the threats from Islamic terrorists are concerned.  What makes Vince so interesting, I believe, is his insights into the political realm as well as the accuracy of Spec Ops weaponry and warefare.  For not only do we track Mitch as he and his fellow Spec Ops Warriors trek all over the world, but we also get to see both sides of the political ramifications of what he is doing.  It makes for an entertaining and informative read.  I can't wait to see what Mitch Rapp does next.
B0053TMP24|5.0|I originally started ordering these books for my children, but now they have to wait till mama's done with them.  I have become very invested in these characters and Rick Riordan is an excellent story-teller.  I am particularly fond of the way the task of narrator shifts from character to character, each with it's own voice, vocabulary, and style.  Masterful!
B006OOHYIC|4.0|not one of those mindless games ... you really have to think out every move carefully. I definitely recommend this challenging great problem solving game!
1606995359|5.0|This book is an excellent choice as a christmas present for my wife - she will love it, who wouldn't!
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|My husband and I loved Hope Springs. He's not really into romantic comedies, but he loved this one! It's geared more toward middle aged couples that have been married for many years.
B003V4AK8E|5.0|I recently got a PS3. I once before had a PS2, loved the games but HATED the controller, which is why I Switched to XBOX. but when i found this t was practically an XBOX controller ( layouts a little different). Must buy for Xbox players though
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is awsome, all of the games on this app are great. It is a good app to play to spend time.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|If you are a dog lover or looking for a good tear jerker, this is your movie.  The fact that it was based on a true story makes it even more powerful.  Critics were a bit hard on it, but if you aren't looking for something critically acclaimed and instead just a feel-good movie, this will be well worth your time.
B0076UXKDG|3.0|I find need of this extended grip as I shoot in portrait way too much to be constantly in the chicken arm pose. The construction is very fine. The battery tray that takes the normal D800 battery as well as the D4 version is a great touch. However the price is robbery. This is not that complex a device to result in such an extravagant price. You can tell by the abundance of third party versions now available.<br /><br />If you were not in a rush and had some time to spend evaluating another manufacturer's version, I would certainly recommend it before shelling out the cash for this version.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|ONCE is one of those delightful surprises you come across when you are tired of the blitz and glitz of the typical show biz that competes for the position of the shiniest and loudest of the day. This ONCE is a gem that demands so little of us audience because it does not seek for the bright light. Rather it tells a simple story of two people (whose names we never learn in the movie) who just are. The story does not preach, nor does it solicit our sympathy or any such emotion. Yet one cannot help but find a place in the heart that rings true with what ONCE gently presents.<br /><br />The music is also fantastic.
0978545095|5.0|I have followed along the past couple years as the Vivian Maier story has become more clear. And this book sheds a ton more light on the subject than what was previously available. Further it puts certain times of her life into context through her evocative photos. Few photographers routinely move me like she does. Her ability to collect the mundane and exalt it in stunning monochrome is unparalleled.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this book highly enough.
1932100660|5.0|This has to be the most important book ever written for 20th century Americans, and others around the world that have been soiled by Western eating habits. Yes, the most important book supplanting the Bible. This is no less than an inspired work by Dr. Campbell.<br /><br />I am a biochemist. It all makes sense. The research is solid and irrefutable. I have read several of the supporting research studies cited by Campbell, and it all holds true. I am a \\"convert,\\" and am now a vegan... mostly for me, but also not to give those bastards in the dairy and meat industry any more of my very hard-earned dollars.<br /><br />Briefly, I am 62 years old, have lost over 30 lbs already (two months), and will probably lose more. I have the vigor of a man half my age... code word \\"vigor,\\" and have fallen in love with my new lifestyle. I have been getting the attention of the ladies as I haven't in a while, and I know I will be alive and functioning optimally well into my 90s. All for reading the overwhelming evidence provide my the good doctor.<br /><br />Read it. Absorb it. Live by it. You CAN do it.
0345803485|1.0|A crashing bore. No, \\"crashing\\" evokes some element of excitement. So just: A bore.<br /><br />I suspect that millions have bought or borrowed the book, and only dozens have finished it. Although that doesn't explain the fact that so many people have bought the others in the series. Inexplicable.<br /><br />And let me be clear. This book isn't dull because I have something against erotic literature. It's dull because I have something against poorly-written literature that purports to be erotic.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This showcases the human spirit (or lack of) during a time of extreme duress.  As you are watching, it forces you to ask yourself questions as to how you would have reacted under the same conditions which is the mark of any good fiction.

1596680296|5.0|I can't really add more to the number of positive responses, but another 5-star can't hurt.<br /><br />The whole idea of knitting socks terrified me for the longest time. The patterns I read were gibberish to me, even another highly popular \\"beginner's\\" book made no sense. Then someone (I wish I could remember who) recommended this book. I am still not a prolific sock knitter, but they make sense now! This book breaks the sock down into clear, easily-followed bits. Whenever I speak to someone who wants to knit socks but is intimidated by the thought, I recommend this book.
B005IQZB14|1.0|This woman started out an unprepared idiot, and never learned a darn thing from the universe or otherwise, her own behavior and attitudes and mishaps didn't seem to wisen her in any tangible way I could glean. And neither will any of you who per chance to read this self absorbed piece of true nonsense. I will give her this, it was brave to venture out alone, and to have persevered through thick and thin, is a great feat; she figured out how to survive and that's saying something. So bravo to that. But the come-away from reading it? A whole lot of wishing I hadn't entered her world. I was hoping for a whole lot more inner searching and growth, not the wallowing in self pity. Oh well... read it if you are desperate to know what not to do before going on an incredibly long trek. Or... if you are desperate to know what not to do to yourself and others. Good idea, it's a great book for what not to do. Have at it.
B008BTOVL6|5.0|In the cult tradition of Spartacus, the halls of every science department now echoes: \\"I AM SHELDON\\"!<br /><br />Currently into its sixth season, The Big Bang Theory proved to be one of the most funny TV sitcoms ever aired. Even if the show seems to have slowed down form its initial explosive impetus, I had not laughed out loud this hard ever since the best days of Frasier and Seinfeld - and Big Bang Theory is consistently brilliant!<br /><br />Sheldon Cooper is unavoidably the king of the show - the massive black hole this Universe revolves around if you will. A child prodigy, now a 24 years old theoretical physicist PhD with absolutely no social skills or known sexual drive. Sheldon may be on the verge of unifying the fields but cannot drive a car to save his life or break a smile even remotely resembling that of a mere homo sapiens.<br /><br />His equally super-intelligent (yet sexually confused at times girlfriend), Amy Farrah Fowler, received a far more enlarged role since the fifth season. However, she was not a very good addition and she unbalances the show. Her character only manages to blur the focus form Sheldon (there is only room for one idiosyncratic genius!), diffuse a number of comically charged situations and gum up the show's flow.<br /><br />Leonard Hofstadter is Sheldon's roommate and primary ...keeper. An experimental physicist himself (who Sheldon tries to \\"help\\" by steering him towards a teaching career), he juggles Sheldon's idiosyncrasies with his personal neurosis - not to mention his crush on his neighbor Penny. Which crush, like lunar eclipses, follow a predicted yet unavoidable periodicity.<br /><br />Leonard tried his hand in a long-distance relationship with his friend Raj's sister, Priya, but he seems to be gravitating back towards Penny once more.<br /><br />Howard Wolowitz is the only one with no PhD (and Sheldon will never let him forget it). An engineer (whose crowning achievements were a mechanized arm that is used in the space shuttle and a liquid waste management solution), he also managed to wreck the Mars Rover in hopes of landing a girl (but he made sure no one can prove anything).<br /><br />The fact that he is a short man with a severely outdated and misguided sense of fashion, still lives with his mother, insists on using a collection of pickup lines straight from men's magazines advice columns - and yet carries himself as God's gift to women is just hilarious.<br /><br />Howard used to be the show-stealer. Whenever he entered the scene you just knew he would offer such an outrageous perceptive that would render you speechless. Now, if only Howard's character was allowed to continue in its stellar trajectory. He has been weighted down by his fianc&eacute;e, Bernadette, who is very likeable, but also is cramping his style. Not to mention that she, slowly yet inescapably, is turning into his scary mother.<br /><br />Rajesh Koothrappali is a particle astrophysicist with a fashion sense close to absolute zero and a severe case of shyness - to the point that he cannot speak in front of women unless inebriated. He takes the \\"metrosexual\\" lifestyle a little too literal for his own good and he keeps using the \\"poor Indian\\" defense even if his father is a rich doctor who drives a Bentley. His character, even in the current sixth season, remains underdeveloped.<br /><br />Then there is Penny. She is the proverbial good girl next door who came to California with stardom aspirations but so far works as waitress and suffers a sequence of bad boyfriends (Sheldon has in fact calculated the exact number of them, extrapolated from a bell-curve that started at 14)- and, obviously, from her neighbors.<br /><br />The show unavoidably makes use of previous sitcom combinations (the odd couple, the unfulfilled love-interest mismatch, the fish-out-of-the-water) but even if one manages to discern them they are used in such a fresh manner that all that is left is great entertainment!<br /><br />The way to truly enjoy this is to own it on DVD. The writing is so smart and the jokes fly so fast (many of them non-verbal) there is just no way to savor it during its weekly air time. Well, may be Sheldon could but then again, who can compare his intellect with his?<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!oy this is to own it on DVD.

B005S9EJ14|5.0|This movie has it all: wonderful cast of British character actors, strong story line and lots of wit and humor.  A group of British retirees are at the crossroads of their lives.  With their lives taking turn towards financial uncertainty and unfulfilled or disappointing life dreams, they decide to reire in India and live in Jaipur, in the hotel called \\"The Exotic Marigold Hotel\\".  Forced to live in closed and cramped quarters, that are still under intense remodelling efforts, they slowly discover that life in a hotel is not exactly as described in the sales brochure. Each person finds themselves in personal discovery of a different kind.<br /><br />There are many funny moments in the movie, but also some that are very wise.  Very touching and sincere, this film will reach out to wide audiences and leave the lasting impression.

B005LAIGOQ|5.0|The Woman In Black (2012). Rated \\"PG-13\\". Running Time: 1 hours, 35 mins.<br />  Directed by James Watkins. Written by Jane Goldman.<br /><br />Remake of [[ASIN:6302925525 Woman in Black [VHS]]] (1989).<br /><br /> Three girls (Emma Storey, Molly Harmon, Ellisa Walker-Reid) are playing dolls and tea during the daytime in the attic. Suddenly, they all look at the windows and at the same time, in a trance, they walk to the windows and open them and fall to their death. A woman dressed in black funeral clothes is seen in the room.<br />  Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe) works for a law firm. He must leave his son, Joseph (Misha Handley) and the nanny (Jessica Raine) for a few days to go to the countryside.<br /> Mrs. Alice Drablow of Eel Marsh House died last month. He must go to the estate in the marshlands to go through much paperwork to find her final will. Every page must be examined. A Mr. Jerome (Tim McMullan) is not cooperating. Arthur's boss, Mr. Bentley (Roger Allam) tells him he must prove his dedication to the future of this law firm. It is his final warning. Arthur's bills at home are overdue.<br />  Aboard the train, Arthur meets Samuel Daily (Ciaran Hinds) who offers to drive him to the Gifford Arms Inn. It is raining hard. At the inn, Mr. Fisher, the innkeeper (Shaun Dooley), doesn't care for Arthur having a reservation and tells him he has no room for him. However, with the agreement of his wife, Mrs. Fisher (Mary Stuckley), he can stay in the attic. Yes! That very attic.<br />  The next day, he arrives at the old Drablow estate. Inside it is very dusty and with huge cobwebs. While going through the papers during the daytime, he hears the floorboards, maybe footprints and other sounds. He goes upstairs to see what it is (I'm not telling). Outside the fog is coming in heavily. In the woods, he sees a woman in black.<br /><br />  Also in the cast: Cathy Sara, Daniel Cerqueira, Alfie Field, Janet McTeer, Victor McGuire, Roger Allam.<br />  Liz White played \\"The Woman in Black\\".<br />  Misha Handley (\\"Joseph\\") is Daniel Radcliffe's real-life godson.<br /><br />Filmed at Cotterstock Hall, Oundle, Northamptonshire, England. Osea island, Essex, North Yorkshire, England, United Kingdom. Pinewood Studios.<br /><br /> This movie, starring Daniel Radcliffe, held my attention and while I am getting used to the use of CGI effects, the scary elements do not work so well for me on television and probably worked better for the big screen.<br /> I did want to see this movie originally at the movie theater, but was unable too.<br /><br />  This was the first movie Daniel Radcliffe filmed after the \\"Harry Potter\\" film series concluded with [[ASIN:B001UV4XJ2 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 (Blu-ray/DVD + UltraViolet Digital Copy)]] (2011).<br /><br />  If Daniel Radcliffe had not been cast in the lead of The Woman in Black (2012) I probably would not have seen it. It is a good role and motion picture for him.<br /><br /> A familiar name is tied to this film...HAMMER, who have been a production company of many thrillers in the past. They are also developing a remake of [[ASIN:B005H8G78O Gaslight]] (1944).<br /><br /> Option of subtitles in English, Spanish.<br /><br /> English Commentary Subtitles.

Pinewood Studios.<br /><br /> This movie, starring Daniel Radcliffe, held my attention and while I am getting used to the use of CGI effects, the scary elements do not work so well for me on television and probably worked better for the big screen.<br /> I did want to see this movie originally at the movie theater, but was unable too.<br /><br />  This was the first movie Daniel Radcliffe filmed after the \\"Harry Potter\\" film series concluded with [[ASIN:B001UV4XJ2 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 (Blu-ray/DVD + UltraViolet Digital Copy)]] (2011).<br /><br />  If Daniel Radcliffe had not been cast in the lead of The Woman in Black (2012) I probably would not have seen it. It is a good role and motion picture for him.<br /><br /> A familiar name is tied to this film...HAMMER, who have been a production company of many thrillers in the past. They are also developing a remake of [[ASIN:B005H8G78O Gaslight]] (1944).<br /><br /> Option of subtitles in English, Spanish.<br /><br /> English Commentary Subtitles.

B001ECPJZO|5.0|Bought this as a Christmas gift for one of my younger grandchildren.  I chuckle everytime I look at it.  I think it's terrific.  Being made of wood gives it support and a little weight for young little hands.  Can't wait to see how it works out.

B007T99ENE|3.0|McEwan is a wonderful writer but this is too clever by half. I never liked any of the characters and found the ending simply contrived. Post-Modernist perhaps but get back to real story telling Ian - that you are brilliant at!
B007MDB6L0|5.0|Loved it!  What else can you say but that once you see &#34;Tink&#34; she's in your heart forever and ever.
B007SSEBCU|2.0|Such a waste of resources! Maggie Thatcher is one of my heroes and I was so looking forward to seeing at least a semi-accurate portrayal of her by Hollywood's most accomplished actress. What I saw instead was a dispiriting depiction of a mere shadow of the \\"Iron Lady\\". For the first 20 minutes of the film we must endure an image of the stooped, aged, confused figure of the former Prime Minister wandering from room to room and trying to outwit her keepers for the occasional solo stroll to the corner convenience store. I breathed a sigh of relief when the film finally transitioned to a younger portion of her life. But the respite was frustratingly brief. The film continued its bewildering \\"ping-pong\\" format throughout to its vacuous conclusion. I don't mind flashbacks, but this film is a haphazard muddle of fact and fancy that pays little or no homage to the towering historical figure of the great lady its title purports to depict.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|One of my favorite movies, it was done sooooooooooooo well!  What well they think of next.  Animation was beyond what I expected!
B002SSUQFG|1.0|the watch looks good. keeps perfect time during the day. However, When I take it off at night, it is a couple of hours slower by morning. I don't know about other people but for me, if a watch makes me late for work because it can't keep time during the night, that's a deal breaker. I'll go back to my cell phone or get a battery-powered watch or perhaps a better-quality mechanical watch. People who loud proclaim that the watch must be worn at all times (even during the night) seem to have lost perspective on what a wrist watch is supposed to be and what role it should play in your life. They have traded the freedom of choosing to take-off your wrist-watch when you please and especially the night-time comfort of not having a canvas and metal shackle on your wrist to serving their little \\"wrist watch overlord\\" which must be worn and exercised 24/7. The have traded the assurance of having a trusty time-keeping device to ferrying around a mechanical gimmick which must constantly be cross-referenced with other time-keeping devices just to be sure it is not deceiving you. Ridiculous! This faulty, inadequate and sad excuse for a watch is going back!

Great Job Eric.

B002RKSZS0|3.0|Good read, but a little trite.  Fun to read, but little overall message to it.  The general theme is a bit lame.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Not a basic match three game. There are too many tricks for that (bombs, timer ads, unbreakable stone blocks, etc). Has a decent plot for the story, but seriously? It just... ends? No actual ending. Just. ends. You can keep going around and from what I hear, the levels are harder, but once you get all the crystals, you're basically done.

B00AE2J5HI|4.0|Movie was great except volume issues. parts of the movie were too quiet & had to up the volume on the surround sound, then others were too loud because of this.
B0076DCT2G|1.0|I am 40% through the book and it has been non-stop, childish one-line wisecracks from the lead character, John Corey. At this point, it makes one wonder whether the author has forgotten why Corey is in Yemen. It also makes you wonder why his, apparently intelligent wife, Kate, puts up with this guy. The whole thing seriously detracts from the book and I won't waste money again on this nonsense.
B009SMW9IW|5.0|Great holiday music beyond the traditional. Up there with great female singer song writers. Put it in with Michael Buble' and Jimmy Buffet.
B000U6BT40|5.0|Strong, positive male and female role models, great campy humor, great acting by all. Over the top scientific ideas and items, but just made the show that much more enjoyable.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I made the mistake of seeing the movie first--great animal special effects, but the story line was confusing at times, although intriguing enough that I ordered the book as soon as I got home.  Wow! All my questions were answered.  The book won the Booker Prize in 2002, which said much.  The writing starts out rather unevenly, but smooths out (it is a first book) and is one of those books that is so full of great philosophical discussions that would be impossible to capture in a movie--about man/animal relationships and religion: the main character, Pi, is a Hindu/Christian/Muslum--! (There's a great scene, not in the movie, when his three teachers coincidently meet him on the street at the same time and discover that each is not his exclusive religious instructor).  You need to know that the lifeboat portion of the story doesn't start until halfway through the book--the first half is about Pi's early life in India.  It's the first book in a long time that I was sorry when it ended.  I also recommend--but NOT if you don't know the ending, which has a twist--that you read some of the 2600+ Amazon reviews--there is some real wisdom and philosophy in many of these comments as well.
B0015ABRE2|2.0|Wonderful series, great season.  Season 3 does a good job of transitioning from one story and scenario to a completely different one by the end of the season.<br /><br />There is an issue with the DVDs, however.  The main title screen shows a background loop of scenes from the series.  These scenes are from the whole season, not just the disk you're watching, and they contain major spoilers from later in the season.  These scenes are unavoidable, they begin playing at the menu screen, and you can't turn them off.  Its very disappointing, not to mention unnecessary.<br /><br />Verdict:  Great show, love it.  Skip the DVDs, though, grab season 3 through digital distribution if you want to watch all the episodes fresh.

B005NJU8PA|4.0|[[ASIN:B00AH01A7K Scandinavian Christmas Dessert Recipes - Cookies, Cakes, Breads & Hot Drinks]]<br /><br />I enjoyed The Four-Hour Workweek and The Four-Hour Body. So I was happy to buy The Four-Hour Chef as soon as it was available on Amazon.<br /><br />As with Tim's other Four Hour books, there are lots of other things included like how to memorize a deck of cards, and how to get the best generator for emergencies. These little asides are quite amusing and do improve the books interest. Heavy duty cooks might get annoyed with them however...<br /><br />I haven't tried any of the recipes yet, but the instructions look clear and the recipes very interesting. Acorn pancakes anyone? I rate the book four stars based on the recipes and its quirkiness.

0439023521|4.0|So, after much persistence from my teenage friends (yes, I have some) I finally buckled and read `The Hunger Games'.  To be honest, it actually took an adult friend (mother to a teenager) to get me to do it.  She read the book after her kid did and told me that it was much better than she expected and that I'd really like it.  Coming down from some heavier reading, I like to mix things up with some light fare to balance out the weight and so I gave it a go.<br /><br />I want to start by saying that anyone who comes here to merely bash at the idea of children killing children really has no grounds to do so since they read the book wholly aware of the contents.  If you can justify reading the book knowing that you will be reading about children between the ages of 12-18 fighting to the death in gladiatorial like matches then you can't complain about the subject matter.  Sure, I'm not sure why there is this cultural fascination with youths engaging in mortal combat, but I can no longer take a stand against it since I was sucked into it and actually read this thing.<br /><br />Seriously though, as mature as the subject (I'm not sure I think twelve year olds should be reading this), this book is a decent read.<br /><br />The Hunger Games referred to in the books title is a televised event where tributes from different colonies in a post-apocalyptic United States fight to the death for honor, wealth and food rations.  The tributes are chosen at random and there are two per colony, resulting in twenty-four tributes ranging from 12-18 who will hunt and kill one another during the course of however many days it takes.  They are dropped off in a manufactured environment with limited resources and they are watched by the world (many of whom are placing bets on who will win).  This is a game, a sport, much like the gladiatorial events in ancient Rome.  `The Hunger Games' centers on Katniss, a young woman who is the sole caretaker for her family after her father died in the mines and her mother basically retreated into herself.  When Katniss's twelve year-old sister is chosen for the games, Katniss offers herself in her place and then prepares herself for battle.  Katniss is smart and skilled, but there is more at stake than her life.<br /><br />First thing to be noted is that the book is a very easy read.  I read it in about three days.  The pages just breeze by, and the plot is very interesting and easy to follow, which was nice.  The character development is a tad formulaic, but it doesn't really matter.  The writing leaves a lot to be desired though.  I'm not a fan of these Young Adult novels mainly because the writing can be lazy in parts, and Collins doesn't escape that trap.  Still, it is a surprisingly captivating read.<br /><br />I didn't really care for some of the later developments (the dogs in particular) which took away from the earthier and realistic tone the book was taking.  I will say that the violence level was less than I expected (I was under the impression this was a bloodbath) but more than I think is appropriate for youngsters.  Taking out the fact that you have sixteen year-olds tossing spears through twelve year-olds, the violence in general regardless of the age of those doing the killing is too intense for a twelve year-old to read.  I'm kind of shocked that parents are OK with this (my friends included).  Following Katniss, who refrains from killing the best she can, a lot of the violence is done `off screen' so-to-speak, so that is a plus.<br /><br />Collins really is taking a jab at the media here, with their current fascination with `reality television' and she does so rather effectively.  One can read this without feeling as though they are being preached to and yet get the message loud and clear.  I'll be reading the other books in the series, since I can't stop at one.<br /><br />All reservations aside, this was a far better read than I expected it to be.s and her mother basically retreated into herself.

B004X4R49Y|5.0|I was expecting a fantastic movie and I wasn't disapointed!  Very well written and great performances.  I would highly recommend to anyone.
B009E3EY38|5.0|I actually saw this film at the theater when it played for those 2 days back in October so I was pretty pumped to get this to watch and listen to at home. Once I saw that it was \\"out for delivery\\" I was really pumped. The quality and clarity of the blu-ray are outstanding, the sound is crisp and clear as is the image. The film itself is the concert from the O2 arena and the concert only, no backstage stuff or limo talk or wizard (like Song Remains the Same). The set list is amazing (Plant even mentions during the concert how they thought about what songs to include along with what songs HAD to be there) and I was surprised at how good Plant sounded singing. John Paul Jones is solid both on keyboards (Trampled Underfoot my favorite) and bass as is Jason Bonham filing in on drums while Jimmy Page shows he still can bring it. Solid, solid buy. I would say this is the best sounding live recording I have ever heard. I have to add that I finally watched the DVD that is included in the set and WOW is it a real letdown. Basically a camera is set up by the soundboard and that is the only camera angle for the entire rehearsal. Yes, you see the top of 4 heads (probably the sound guys) and the band (from a distance) as they rehearse the show. If you are a huge fan or need something to play while you are doing something else I guess it is for you, but I really don't see any need for it.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I bought this for my grandson to use when he is over.  He absolutely loves it.  I have even found myself playing it a few times.
B00005O3VD|5.0|Received movie pretty fast.  Quality was ubelievably crisp.  My 12 year old daughter is singing Don't Rain on My Parade for Audition and she need to see what the words meant and sure enough now she gets it and and as I knew she would has watched the movie 3 times to boot.  Thanks!!!

B005LAIHZY|5.0|There were 3 Lightning Deals on this for the same price ($8). All the stores were out on Black Friday. The new queue system is great.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|I loved everything about this book!  The pacing was good, the main character was (for me) especially relatable.  The pacing was great.  The overall idea was unique and quite entertaining.  This is my first exposure to this author, and I love how he has a knack for details and getting inside peoples heads.  He describes characters, surroundings, colors, and emotions in a way that is never too little or too much detail allowing you to really get lost entirely in the story.  My only gripe was that it seemed really short.  But it was exactly the book i had been looking for! Can't wait to pick up more from this author.
B002RI9SC4|5.0|The author nicely tied up all the loose ends in this book. Great read and by far the best book of the series!
B006VGGAC4|2.0|I started reading this for the drama and juicy details. It's taking forever. There are 30 chapters and the first 8-10 are about body building.

B004ZZS4CC|3.0|Difficult for a couple of reasons:  It's written as Jaycee talks, and her story itself is a hard, upsetting one to understand or accept.  I know that she's done an interview, and I think that following up the book with listening to her in an interview might give a better story all around.
B008M62KJI|5.0|If you are a SOS fan, you will love 'Private View\\" as it contains wonderful remixes of many of their past tunes that make you feel as if you are at one of their intimate and engaging concerts. A \\"must\\" for SOS fans as Andy Connell's arrangements with new flugelhorn infusions blended with Corrine Drewery's impeccable vocals make for a dreamy and unforgetable mix

030758836X|3.0|First of all, I *love* books that let you know Things Are Not As They Seem. So, without, knowing much about this book except that it was supposed to be a page-turner, I was prepared to like it. (Linwood Barclay's Never Look Away was that kind of book.) That creeping feeling that there's something just around the corner or a plot twist that will make you go back and question what you thought at first? Count me in. And that's what this book was, for about the first half.<br /><br />But, for me, this was like taking a ride in a car along a dark road and then lurching wildly through the woods, then plowing into the water, then being attacked by bears, and finally being abducted by aliens. I'm fine with stetching plots, but this became ridiculous and I lost interest long before the end. The writing was very good but the massive plot holes and unbelievable characters just did me in.<br /><br />I think what I would have wanted was the level of the first part continued: the is she or isn't he? -- but the book quickly lost that level of subtlety and veered off into crazy land. I'm fine with dysfunction (well, in literature), fine with characters who have major flaws, but I need *something* to hold together.
B005LAIGTG|5.0|love the true life love stories, made me cry a couple times. but definitely a keeper for me. although the quality of the case was poor and I thought I was getting a digital copy with the blue ray I didnt
B000XR4OC0|3.0|My daughter loves these shoes, but the size accuracy varies. I ordered the exact same size twice over the past year, and there is about a half-inch difference in length. So, it is difficult to know which size to order now.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was a lot better than the first, had more depth to it and an actual plot line.  Really good!
B007HACDLK|4.0|I've enjoyed reading the exploits of Mitch Rapp and this latest installment did not disappoint.  The action pulled me along and I thoroughly enjoyed the story. The characters were three dimensional which lent credibility to the fiction.
0345803485|1.0|This book is extremely lame. The only \\"fun\\" is the fantasy of being that rich! I read the book really fast but there was really nothing exciting that happened. I guess after reading amazing books like A Song of Ice and Fire series, I was expecting too much. If you are looking for a quick read that is semi interesting, then this could be the book for you.  The second book is SO much worse.
B007PFD90G|4.0|The book takes us into Rushdie's life when he was a self-imposed prisoner of a fatwa imposed on him.  It goes too much into the political dealings and becomes a bit repetitive.
0345803493|1.0|OMG this book is SO repetitive, whiny, boring, and annoying.  There is no drama, no excitement, and it's the same thing over and over again.  Not to mention the book is really poorly written.  I am not a fan...
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|A full mix of adventure, mystery, drama, and fun. One of the best movies of the season and in a long time in this genre in my opinion

B003JRD5JO|5.0|Amazon mp3 advertised a special album sale on Facebook.  I participated in the promotion and they had excellent choices, one being Slippery When Wet.  I purchased and it was available to me immediately!
B009YJEKJK|1.0|And....this is one of them! I don't know what sounds worse: John Travolta's bland singing or Olivia's vocally strained attempt at it. Her voice barely registers and she sounds as if she's got a cold on most of the songs. Whatever magic these two had as a duo, it ended when they flew off into the air during the final moments of GREASE. Back then, she was in her prime and was lovely to hear and he sounded....well....much like he does today, which is why he's never had a great musical career. But whoever thought of this travesty of songs ought to have their head examined. Having Streisand show up at the END of song? What, did they just catch her driving with her chauffer on Melrose and get her to utter one line? The saddest thing is that the guest stars sound better than the main ones and it's because neither of these two have that special magic to pull of an album of tunes alone, much less together. Sorry, but this ranks up there with \\"Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer\\" as one of the worst holiday recordings on record. And I thought you couldn't ever top the cats meowing \\"Jingle Bells\\"--even THAT sounds a lot more like Christmas than this flaccid outing.
1579128149|5.0|It's big beautiful book with photos that show the intrinsic beauty of the elements. The bits of history and humor making reading it fun too. If I had an iPad, I would probably buy the app too.

B002VX3RCW|5.0|This is my favorite for some reason. Lamaze is a great company for baby toys. Would buy again maybe even one for me.
B00AE2I4WK|2.0|My 12 year old daughter desperately wanted to watch this for the dancing.  I was concerned about potential adult content but the director demonstrated restraint.  Good thing because if not for the incredible dancing, cool costume and visuals, this movie is void of any meaningful content.  We would have enjoyed it even more if it were an hour of pure dance.
0307730697|5.0|This book is a must read for every American! Adults need to pass these stories on of our True American Heros and glorify Honor, not stupidity like the reality tv shows of today.
B003HTPHSQ|3.0|Sorry but despite the critical appeal, Cyndi isn't a credible blues voice.  How Blue Can You Get? is the best song on the album but mostly because of the band.
B000I0QKDS|5.0|This is where Jeff Beck's solo career launched. Arguably our greatest contemporary guitar innovator, Beck's album dazzled and amazed when it was first released, and holds up extremely well today.
B008CLI3TE|1.0|I watched the first 3 episodes of season 1, looking forward to finding a new, quality series to become engrossed in.  I loved Lord of the Rings as well as other good fantasy and science fiction.  I just could find nothing about this series worth watching.  It's a bunch of dysfunctional royal families, with stereotypical overbearing kings, conniving queens and evil princes, vying for power and willing to do anything to get it.  I see no love, no compassion, no spirituality whatsoever; darkness after darkness upon darkness is just plain boring and unimaginative.  I also found the sexuality to be totally and completely presented from an adolescent male's perspective; again, boring and unimaginative (not to mention demeaning and objectifying toward women).
B005K17RU0|3.0|I think the over all look of the App is very nice.  The only real issue I have with the App is that it doesn't have the ability to rotate to fit my Kindle Fire when I have it sitting horizontal.  That is the way I usually keep it on my desk.  I know the weather channel app has the ability to rotate, but I really do like the look of the AccuWeather better.
B004GFN11A|2.0|This app is disappointing.  It's great for approving/replying to comments  on the go, but it is practically worthless for composing posts.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|Big fan of this movie! Roles played by active duty SEALs. I've heard comments about the acting, but they are the real deal, what do you want them to act like? Crazy mix of intense and emotional moments. If the action, honor, or sacrifice don't hook you, then check to make sure you still have a pulse. Really makes you appreciate the dangerous people that put their lives on the line to defend freedom. Two thumbs up!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I was excited to see that Harlequin is launching a new romance line, Kiss, in 2013.  Waking Up Married was available free when I downloaded it, so it was hard to resist!  I enjoyed the story, but I found the hero selfish and manipulative.  This was a quick, breezy read, and I am looking forward to more Kiss titles.
1589795474|2.0|There is really no reason for this book to be as long as it its. Not that it is incredibly long, but the whole book could easily be summed up in less than 10 pages. It is very repetitive, and chalked full of filler, explaining the same thing over and over again.<br /><br />Here's my one sentence summary of the book:<br />The typical millionaire owns their own business, is married, drives a used car, lives well below their means, and is very modest with their wealth.<br /><br />The whole point of the book is to explain that the typical millionaire does not live like Donald Trump. I guess it is geared for people who have never thought about that concept before? Other than generating a book to sell, I can't see why it would take so many pages to explain this fact.
0486424510|5.0|Fun story and my book club had fun reading and discussing it.  The plot and characters are so fun.  I'm surprised how many people aren't familiar with one of the first detective novels ever written!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|In the interview Ken Follett said his writing style was such that he tried with every page to compel the reader to continue, I would have to say he is pretty much true to his word in my case.  Unfortunately or fortunately depending on your point of view, both books are in excess of 900 pages, so if the book pulled you in like it did me, then I hope you have the disposable time to dedicate to these books or plan on living on a lot less sleep while you are enjoying this Trilogy.  I would recommend if  you do read them, that while you are being introduced to the characters you fill a chart by country of the characters.  Mr Follett, if you read these reviews, a chart of characters for this Trilogy would be useful.  I saw a similar chart for another series on your website.  My area of personal study was history, so what keeps me in these books is the journey and explanations that tie the characters to the historical events.  If I had any input in the series I would have included more details, while I am reading this book, I have used &#34;Guns of August&#34; to fill in some of the blanks or add clarification.  I think the most important thoughts I have come away with and expanded refection on is the retaliative economic status/life style in the different counties and how the political systems directly effect them.  If I might slip upon a small soap box here, I am feeling a lesson from history might be useful in our own economic and political systems today.  The countries who exploited their populations and had little regard of the worth of their citizenry as part of the economic system, witnessed either severe declines or total destruction of their systems.  Those rulers who had no regard for the dignity or value of human life at all found themselves at best experiencing revolutions by their people which left them without a kingdom to rule, and at worse met with the ultimate recourse by their citizenry and were killed in the most gruesome way.  Maybe a lesson for the 1%ers today, they seem for whatever reason to strive for more and more of a pie that is getting smaller which fulfills no useful goal that I can understand.  if they encouraged economic growth for all of the citizenry I believe they would see a  bigger and bigger pie to divide for everyone and more people would have the ability to enrich those same 1%ers by buying their wares and at the same time eliminate the need for 47 million people currently on food stamps in this country of being in this position, and suffering the ridicule of the haves against the have nots for being there in the first place, when like many in the book at their because of no fault of their own.  The lesson I see in Fall of the Giants and fear is that the masses will only tolerate oppression and the boot heal of the aristocracy/oligarchy until it becomes too much to tolerate.  Wasn't my intent to get on such a high soap box. -- I guess the point was for a review for others to read Mr. Follett's book, I would recommend such.  Bill Shaw --- Kansas City
B0057A6GA6|5.0|Who could ask for more.  This is every turret defense gamers dream game.  Then add on top of that 4 difficulty levels, is like getting four games in one.  I have this game for my kindle fire and my HTC Thunderbolt, and on both systems the picture is good, the gameplay is smooth and they both kick ass.

1594203334|5.0|I'm not finished with this book yet, but it's an interesting comparison to American parenting. Some things I agree with and some things I don't. I think it's written as an examination, and each reader can take away what they want from it.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I absolutely loved this book. Even though the ending was kinda obvious, it kept me on my toes and left me yearning to see what happened next. Definitely a great read!!!
B001UV4XIS|5.0|My whole family loves the whole Harry Potter series.  We have both the books and the dvds now in complete sets... along with a few of the video games.

B001992NUQ|5.0|...which means this is an awesome movie!  Long live Tyler Durden!  A definite must have in any real man's collection.
B004WGIXX4|5.0|This is one of my all time favorites!  I've watched it multiple times and it still makes me laugh.  Natalie Portman, what else can I say?
B006H5120E|5.0|My girlfriend has several other versions of this, but this is 3D...  I will say that this is by far the best movie that I have ever watched in 3D at home.  It was well worth sitting through all the love stuff again just for the 3D effects.
B008DL466C|1.0|This is just an embarrasment. Fame has turned WK from a little known sensation into a pop media disaster. Lyrics repeat themselves, none of the beats are dope, it's just ultimately 100% a different Wiz. I persoanlly hated rolling papers because I loved all the old school Wiz from Kush and OJ all the way back to Pittsburgh Sound. So you know it has to be bad if people are saying he fell off from rolling papers cause im astonished it couldve gotten worse. Save your money on this one. Its terrible
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|One of the best movies of all time given the royal treatment.  Anyone saying this is not a big upgrade is probably not reviewing this product.  Look at the date of their review!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I don't know where to begin, I saw the movie first. Loved it, read the book and I feel I got another side of the story. Mr. Quick tells a story that isn't pretty, it's honest and heartfelt. Cheesy line but I laughed, cried and found the silver lining. What a great read, it made me not ashamed of my past struggles with depression, it made me see that those experience were valuable. Pat, the main character's mental break was handled with great care and it was an emotional journey. The tone of the book wasn't heavy, even though the subject matter isn't a light topic. On screen or on a paper Pat is a great character and his development is something that should not be missed.

B009CGRXSK|5.0|Great movie - inspirational and based on real life events....a must see/own movie! You WANT to be a Doctor and part of the Gesundheit Institute!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Well written action-packed story with no-holds barred. Not for the faint-hearted, but not too extreme either. Basic credibility is maintained even for such extreme plot setting. This season packs a bit more punch than season 2, and in some way redeemed season 2 which now appears more like a hiatus before getting to serious business.
B0011Z76RS|5.0|I love, love LOVE this album!  This is one of my overall favorite albums of all-time!  From the beginning to the end, this album rocks!
B008QTVNUI|4.0|This is a gripping and suspenseful story for the most part. The acting is first rate and the editing is creative. There are long winded sections and some characters appear a bit of caricatures.
B001FB55LC|4.0|Good casting...Brings home the personal horrors of the aftermath of war.  One is never the same after experiencing the combat zone.  It is particularly true for those captured and tortured.
B00AGH6FD8|3.0|My seven year old loved it.  went crazy for it and talked about how great it was for days after.  He loved the first one and they've done the best they could with milking a sequel.  The formula for the first movie over-laid nicely onto a new york setting.  The homeless woman was an inevitable choice for the mystic in any heroes arc, but fake homeless people always make me queasy.  Don't look for shakepeare here, but all kids love it when grownups get hurt and this movie delivers in spades!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|His books are always great and interesting some of the behind the scenes of the law practice written by a lawyer.  only one book of his that was boring and I have read them all.
B005LAIII0|5.0|Life of Pi gave me so much to think about. It is a stunning movie with great visuals, which I happened to see in 3D (It made it even more awesome). The scenes with just him and Richard Parker were absolutely amazing. During the movie I started to really like the Tiger. But as well as the visuals and story, the message was amazing.<br /><br />In the beginning of the movie he is talking to a man who was told by Pi's friend that Pi could convince him to believe in God. He told an absolutely beautiful and intriguing story that was at the same time very sad. He lost his whole family at the beginning of the movie, and he was the only person who got to the boat alive. The four animals that survived were the hyena, monkey, and zebra. Those three all died. The hyena killed two of them and then the tiger, Richard Parker, came out from under the canvas covering part of the raft and killed the hyena. Pi jumped off the boat just in time as Richard Parker went for him. After this they survived together for many weeks, and lived through storms and many other dangerous sea experiences. Then the wierdest part was when he reached the island shaped like a sleeping person, which was made out of some mossy material and was completely floating in the water. It was covered by thousands of merecats, many of which Richard Parker ate. Pi began to get comfortable, but as soon as night came Richard Parker fled to the boat and the merecats into the trees. Pi went into the trees also, and slept. At one point either in the night or the morning he opened up a plant bud, in which was the tooth of another human being. He realized that even thought the island gave him rest, drink, and food, it was poisonous and he could not stay there. Also, the water pool which he had drunk from earlier had disintegrated the fish with some kind of acid. So he left with Richard Parker, and they continued their journey. He eventually reached the coast of mexico. Richard Parker fled into the woods without turning back,but he did stop for a moment before going into the forest. Pi cried for a long time. After telling this story to the listener, he told a second story which took about one to five minutes of the movie. In that story it was a gruesome tale of him, his mom, the cook, and a sailor on the boat. The Cook killed both the sailor(Zebra) and the monkey (Pi's mom). But then Richard Parker (The ferocious side of Pi in this version of the story), killed the cook. He survived by himself on a boat for many weeks/months before arriving in Mexico.<br /><br />One way of interpreting the story is that Richard Parker and the animals were in fact just representations of people, and that he was just inventing this story to keep away the pain of what happened. But another interpretation is to take it literally. After saying these two stories he asked, \\"Which story do you prefer\\" and the person answered, \\"The one with the Tiger\\" And so that is sort of where it ended, leaving you with the question of which one is true. Logically the story that he told second is true, but the beautiful story that he spent a long time telling is the one that it seemed was more emotional for him. So in the end it left me contemplating these two and I still am.<br /><br />But overall even with the confusing aspects of this movie, it left me with a great message. At one point near the end he said, \\"As is the way of God\\" This sort of made me think that even though we have to suffer in this life, we can make it into something beautiful. So believing in God is giving you hope, something to believe in instead of nothing, and a way to keep sane.

It's that good.<br />Talk about a thrilling, suspenseful, well written story. It's chock full of goodness.

B006RXQ2CY|5.0|Give a light on how the Royal Family has to deal with the public scrutiny of every little and big event they go through.  They were not elected in to these position but born into them, whether or not they want it.  They are people whom are thrown into the spot light and some do it very well but the others should be able to have their privacy none the less.
B000GKW4HG|5.0|The size and of course the Papo atention to details and amazing job paint makes this one a terrific adition to my collection.<br />Again no moveable jaw.  :c

B0076DELIG|4.0|This is good reading to take your mind off the pressures at work at night while you are trying to rest, unless you are a crime solver that is.
B009NOVCTM|5.0|The shipping was fast, the CD showed up with no damage.  I think this is a good addition to my Rolling Stones collection.  One CD set that I can take along on vacation that has a pretty good selection of songs from the Rolling Stones over the years.
B007M45PMU|5.0|I love this album and will continue to follow The Lumineers in the future.  You may also hear some of these songs in commercials!
B0055QL28I|2.0|Not very interesting plot. Nice photographic FX. I am disturbed by the underlying message of this children's story warped to celebrate evil.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|I loved this book! Brandon Sanderson seems to consistently put out excellent reads! If you haven't read anything by Brandon Sanderson, do yourself a favor and treat yourself now!
B009HELT3C|4.0|Tommy Lee Jones is seriously aging, Will Smith is aging beyond the wise-cracking young-adult as well. This was an entertaining, but getting threadbare escapist movie.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|grabs you and does not let go - easy to identify with lead character - realistic and true to life
B000002ADT|5.0|Greatest jazz album ever. This album brings satisfaction to the soul like a wellspring a thousand miles deep that never runs dry, with bubbling water tastes fresh every day, no matter years of drinking it!
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|This film overall is wonderful. The actors, the soundtrack, directors and everyone else was absolutely on top of their A game! Holmes horrendous act was unfortunate but not the movie companies fault. Therefore I will reccomend this movie any time of the day.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Unique story, funny yet touches the heart too, creative and a champion for those &#34;nerd&#34; of society.  Excellent acting by the children star, and a very unusual period movie.
B000OCXI3K|4.0|Really liked the movie version, but the book is just as good and includes a bit more background on the main characters.  Since I saw the movie first, I pictured the actors from the movie as I was reading.
B00003CXC6|5.0|Watch the special features for a thorough understanding of the story and the film's cinematic artistry.  I highly recommend this and any other Kurosawa film.
B003H9MSPG|3.0|Subject is the biggest point. The barrell actually makes it shoot shorter. Take it off, throw a sling on it, and it works great as a backup. I'd buy the long clips for it too. The small clips run out QUICK.

B004K4IZ54|5.0|OK - I'm going to start off by saying I love all things Tron.  Loved the original, and thought that Tron - Legacy was a really cool follow up, which a unique take on the original.  Saw Tron - Legacy in IMAX 3D when it came out.  Bought the DVD when it came out on DVD/Blu-Ray.  Recently, I just got a new 3D TV and Blu-Ray.  So, like the nerd I am, I had to buy Tron - Legacy 3D.<br /><br />It was absolutely incredible.  With the system cranked, the lights dimmed, and the 3D glasses on, I watched it and was completely blown away.  Both my wife and I kept commenting on how amazing the 3D was.  It was seriously even better than in the theater.<br /><br />If you you are even reading this review, it means you are potentially going to buy this disc.  Stop thinking about it.  Do it.  It's money.

B00846REIS|3.0|First let me say that everyone is saying this is just like 50 shades, in my opinon, its not.  Aside from Gideon being a Billionare, I think thats about it. Yes there is a lot of sex, but if you read anything from this genre, this is typical stuff.  In my opinon Gideon is a little more aggrestive/possesive than to my liking.  As far as the writting, I think this was better written than 50 shades.  If you decide to read this book (series)please put the thought that this is going to be like 50 Shades out of your head, it will ruin the experience of this book (series).<br /><br />I have read the first two books back to back so its hard to separate the two books into separate reviews so this is for Both books: Bared to You & Reflected in you.

B009K0P10K|5.0|Great acting. Love the plot and the characters. It is exciting and fascinating modern day drama. Can't wait till the next episode.
B004HW7JH4|5.0|There's not much more that can be said about this series that hasn't already been printed.  Suffice to say that series 5 continues in the same great vein as series 1 to 4.  There are some surprises in store and this entire series has to be up there with the very best shows ever produced.  Having said that, it might help if you can relate to the 1960's and the work/social environment at that time.  However, that should not preclude younger people from enjoying the series.  Drama at its very best.

1469984202|5.0|I love this series!  A friend of mine told me about it and told me I should read it.  She was right.  And now I'm saying YOU should read it too!  I picked up the Omnibus edition (books 1-5 in one).  Trust me when I say that if you pick up the first book (or even just read the sample), you're going to want all 5 so you might as well get them all in one shot.  It moves along quickly and leaves you wondering what could happen next.  The characters draw you into their world and you'll find yourself quickly taking sides.  My legs hurt just reading about hiking up and down the silo stairs!  (Ironically, I did most of my reading on an elliptical with this series)  I'll be downloading the \\"Shift\\" trilogy next which follows this one.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Tells me what I need to know for the weather and what to expect for the day hour by hour
B009CPES4I|4.0|It's is an enjoyable film with rich colors and an exotic locale. The plot is a little predictable but that doesn't take away from the simple pleasure of this film. Of course, the cast shines through and makes it a joy to see.
1401322425|5.0|There are not enough 'stars' for Jamie Oliver. Not only are the recipes great, but the gardening tips a wonderful, too!
B00881VLCE|3.0|This is a fun game that I enjoyed playing. I do like the pieces on the side in a \\"runner\\" so they are easy to find. I don' t like ads popping up in the middle of a puzzle. I also think they should have more variety in the puzzle pictures.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|surprisingly excellent. was expecting a little cheese, but this book is a classic for a reason - fantastic. and free! :)
B005ZUR724|5.0|this game is awesome I just wish they had mounts. and it is a lot cheaper than world of war craft.
B003QSMCKO|5.0|Watched this movie for the 10th time with my 12-year old on Amazon. It's still so moving and refreshing. It is one of the classic you can count on.
B005K17RU0|4.0|It's a simple reminder of the weather and I like it staying on the screen.it's seems to be usually right.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|The character development was fine and the imagery was good... the story line was lacking.  It wasn't the meaningful holiday time story we were looking for.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My grandson downloaded this on my Kindle Fire so he could try it out. He had such a great time playing this game.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|This movie has a great length and awesome climax I must say it is the best movie yet and hopefully there will be another
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My grandson also downloaded this free game on my Kindle Fire, I enjoyed watching him get through the different levels. Thanks Amazon once again!!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I thought this book was facinating.... I had trouble putting this book down.  Would like to find more books like this one!!
B008PE9GSA|4.0|Having lived in Texas since the mid 70's I have been a big ZZ fan and then lost interest with some of their 80s and 90's stuff. This album reminds me of the old ZZ with just a hint of some of the better points of their middle stuff mixed in. The Rev's voice is a little gruffer but his guitar work is still smokin...Dusty and Frank are golden...I still believe Frank to be one of the best shuffle beat drummers around....overall a great listen that is currently in my CD player in my pickup.
B001CTGQBK|1.0|throughout the screening the picture would be fuzzy, felt like i was watching a bootleg film, not one i had payed for on a website.  Was very disappointed because this film isn't even an action film, its a musical and it still was grainy.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Could not put this book down, it was so good.  I Am thinking purchasing a few copies as holiday gifts.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|LOVE THE CHALLANGE WITH THIS GAME ,I AM HOOKED ON IT CAN PLAY FOR HOURS IF I PLAY IT RIGHT
B000TERKJQ|5.0|Ms. Ferrell is amazing!  A true vocal stylist and quintessential musician.  I already had a copy of this CD a few years ago, but I cannot find it and miss hearing her sing.  This lady can sang...and I mean it just like I wrote it
B007STBUIW|4.0|Excellent restoration of a true classic. The visual detail is outstanding and it has new life! Colors even pop off the screen! On the downside, the DTS HD Master audio has modifications and deletions to the original soundtrack which is something I'll always remember as a young adult.<br />Down on the pier in the evening when Brody and Hooper disect the tiger shark, the original track has sounds of a distant fog horn chiming in every ten to fifteen seconds. On the 'Updated' track several of the fog horn blows have been deleted. They are still on the original mono track however. There are other modifications and deletions as well.<br />don't get me wrong please! I'm sure there are many fans out there who love this new soundtrack. I, for one, wish the original mono could have had a DTS HD Master audio update as well, instead of lossy.<br />I would have given it 5 stars, but still it's a great release.
B00124PXW8|5.0|This is such a good movie, I loved it ! I don't know how after all these years I never saw this movie, I think there we so many remakes or maybe similar titles that I just thought I had seen it, I'm so glad I ran across it at Amazon instant videos......
B006BG7RI0|5.0|Excellent!! I had the previous release which had lossy Dolby Digital. Though it wasn't a travesty, I knew it could sound better. Now it does with this DTS HD Master audio there is more depth to the sound field, not to mention the visual effort which is another outstanding job by the staff @ Warner.<br />Terrific work!!!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|From the first, John Grisham established an engaging formula: a legal thriller in which the protagonist, usually an overmatched attorney, finds a way to outwit the bad guys and, just for fun, outwits us as well by leaving a few, small, strategic gaps that only get filled near the end. Malcolm Bannister is a likable, sympathetic character; some of the bad guys turn out to be good guys; and some of the good turn out to be okay, but a little less smart than they think. Things move quickly, take several unexpected turns, and end up in the right place - with everyone getting exactly what he or she deserves. Fun on most pages and funny on many. Enjoy!
B001KMB6X2|5.0|Enjoyed this movie very much. The story was interesting and held my attention. If you're a Van Diesel fan or not, I'm sure you will get into to it and watch it to the end. Not all futuristic movies are all that interesting anymore as they show only violence and often lack a good plot. Yes, this one also gets violent (as all Van Diesel movies do and what we expect of him) but it also has some depth to it and very good acting by the supporting actors. Decided to watch it a second time and discovered some parts i had missed the first time, due to some interuptions. Well worth the money, good entertainment!
B007U4DB4G|5.0|The Blu ray had beautiful colors.  The characters were delightful.  Although, we still liked the 1st movie better.  It was delivered in a timely fashion and at a great price.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|Had this movie in black & white on VHS ever since it came out and enyoyed it every year. This year, i figured I give the colorized version on DVD a try and I was very surprised how great it showed up on my wide screen TV. As I do have a vision problem due to macula degeneration and can not see everything as clearly as I used to, I was worried that the colors would look more blurry since it's been remade and colorized but this was not the case. I could see the picture as well as any other original color movie or TV in general. I own many Christmas movies, from the old black & white Christmas in Connecticut to the Rankin/Bass animated stories and Tim Allen's Santa Clause 1 - 3. I enjoy them all once a year comes December but Miracle on 34th Street is still my all-time favorite. Edmund Gwenn made the perfect Santa and the rest of the cast played their  parts beautifully. I have been a Maureen O'Hara fan since way back so it's always wonderful to see her again in this charming story. I don't think I have to go into detail about the story itself - many reviews have been left already. Just want to say that this old movie always adds to my spirit for the holdidays!
0061692042|5.0|I was led to believe this book was more about a bank robbery and how it affected the whole family.  There is to much info that has nothing to do with the story..I had a hard time making myself read the whole book.  Just thought it would get better instead of worse.  Boring and a waste of time.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|Good Cast, made on the cheap.  Seems like a cheaply made movie.  It's entertaining if you like action movies.  If you've seen the first one, you'll know what to expect.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|The Walking Dead Season one tells us and shows us what the world has become for these characters. As the show goes threw their first six shows they show how powerful the human spirit is and what it can go threw and survie.  The show mixes many elements together like drama between the actors as the storyline goes along.  How determine we can be to find answers to the questions we have about what is happening to us.  The show itself reminds me of the old style zombie movies, just with more depth and intensity to keep the show going for a long time in my viewpoint.  I think this is a great tv show and will be on for a long time because it mixes drama, sadness, anger, love, so forth between all the actors because they want to find out what is out there in this new world.  While they trust each other to protect one another as they travel along their journey.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|My only regret was buying this as an e-book, which led to me reading it at work one night and trying not to cry. The characters are superbly developed, the book is well written, and it offers some great insight into life and love. Buy it now, you won't regret it.
B008JGSM6G|1.0|I purchased this game for my 7 year old daughter because it seemed like a good game to challenge her thinking skills. We both enjoyed the game until I discovered that your company charged my credit card $2.99 every time she asked for a hint on the difficult puzzles. I was not too pleased to find 12 charges on my debit card for these hints. I tested the game myself and no where does it prompt you stating that you will be charged for the hints. I do not recommend this game to anyone!!!!! What a rip off!!!!
B00A72989U|3.0|I am disappointed in this album, I was so looking forward to it. I love all her previous albums but this one has maybe 2 or 3 songs that are good. I still love her though.
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|I think it is better than the version I see on my computer. Less confusing stuff on the page. Straightforward, just the articles and photos. I like very much.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|I have all of Nelson DeMilles books. I throughly enjoy them. He has been one of my absolute favorite authors for years.  He writes so well that at least I can picture and image myself there with his characters.  I have to admit that I really enjoy John Corey.  He makes things fun.
B003QSEYQY|5.0|The kids loved the movie but they like the animated movie better, but i enjoyed it was great to watch it again!
B002HFJ77S|5.0|I just love the way kinsella tells a story, just like my last read of another book \\"Borrowing my Mother's Saints\\" both authors make you feel light and joyful upon reading their novels. You laugh and cheer for the heroins while shedding an ocassional tear. Lovely books that guarantee a smile at the end.
8866130931|5.0|My son asked for this Moleskine 2013 Calendar for his birthday this December. He's pursuing a doctorate in Economics at U. of Washington in Seattle. He teaches and TA's graduate and undergrad classes in economics along with research so keeps a busy schedule which he needs to keep track of.<br /><br />I asked him why he liked this particular Calendar--he not only appreciates the materials it is made out of, he said he likes the spacing on the pages. It suits his particular needs. As a former math major undergrad, he is particular about spacing and organization. He keeps me organized when he's home a few weeks of the year. This is a great gift for a student.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Glad I read it - wish it were a bit more hopeful though - tough to think of folks growing up with little to look forward to.
B008YZXYY2|5.0|The packaging and the presentation is really good.<br />I love the album and the combination of strong heavy songs with some nice ballads. Probably the best Stone Sour Album so far.
B004I744AS|5.0|This is an excellent app- its.not.just a dictionary app. This app gives a multi varied experience. its fun as well as educational
B005DI66N4|5.0|I suffered with the author and wonder how he ever survived this trek.  It brings home how fortunate we are to live in a free society and how the totalitarian governments enslave people.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|THe plot is very hard to follow, but the acting and drama more then make up for it. It's fun movie.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|no sense trying to get a good picture when the lens is on the side and you can't see where the button is
B004XN3FHA|5.0|Do you want to see something at night in a totally dark area.<br />Then this is the flashlight for you.<br /><br />Bright light, long distance. I consider this a perfect flashlight.
B0058YPL66|5.0|Amazing show for everyone. Suitable for children and the entire family. My husband loves it as well. There is something for everyone. You have to watch from the beginning ... you'll be hooked!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn has written a self-fulfilling prophecy.  Its amazing he wrote this book before Benghazi and green-on-blue confrontations were making headlines.  He definitely has his finger on the pulse of US foreign policy.
B008220AVW|5.0|Thought I would hate this. I got it for my 11 year old. I may have liked it more than her. If you are a fan of Katy Perry this movie is for you. If you're not a fan you will be after watching this. She is a class act and extremely professional.
B005J7K964|4.0|I have no idea why these other reviews are here...This is not the same movie, kinda...<br /><br />Giorgio Moroder created a very insightful version of this iconic film.  The original was severely edited and rebuilt over the years.  Moroder took the basic, what survived film and added a [1980s] contemporary soundtrack.  He did leave out some references to \\"moloch\\" and did not r-time the film to move in real time, rather than \\"jerky-time.\\"  (For those who still do not know, film in the 20s ran at a slower frames-per-second than they do today...hence the jerkiness of the movie.  Moroder did not alter that.  What he did do was completely modernize a pre-talkie classic.  Definitely worth while to have on your shelf, next to the complete versions.
B009EP3DJM|2.0|It's not that I'm surprised because it is similar to everything she's released so far, which I also own.  It just seems less tongue in cheek this time. This isn't really an album as much as a group of similar songs that she and her producers feel have a chance to break big on radio.  As an album, it is the same thing over and over.  The songs don't build to climaxes, they are climaxing all the time.  It's like making love to that unfortunate woman who suffered from hundreds of involuntary orgasms a day and recently killed herself.  It's not sexy, it's sexed.<br /><br />It's ironic that this is what female empowerment has come to...a shameless, vulgar pursuit of earthly pleasures devoid of love, commitment, and satisfaction. It's sad that this album is so typical today. Now, we will have to endure a remix album, ugh. Next time Kesha, aim higher.  You are smarter than this.
B006LSZECO|3.0|It was suspenseful until you get to the end...  I was disappointed in the ending but it was very entertaining.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|Needs to quit explaning her the back ground of the people in the book. We all know how they are interacting from the past. Ms Cornwell needs to put more action on the plot of her story and less on the people.
0316174483|5.0|6 year old had no problems following the instructions to create a masterpiece! Fun ideas and lots of details on how to create them
B000FC1HQY|5.0|This was a very interesting read, written from the perspective of a young girl in Africa during very difficult times.  Her family is British and a little disfunctional, however they love Africa and continue to endure the difficult times and the civil unrest between the blacks and whites.
B000LN7HUC|5.0|Trangia's are very good quality, fun to use, extremely compact, and durable. Clean up is easy, and they can be repacked fully fueled without fear of leaks. They are a little pricey, however!
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I hate that in order to give a review they require you to make a comment! Why? Can i just not like something without having to explain it... fustrating!
B00005LOUQ|4.0|I absolutely love this movie! It is so funny! And it's a great rendition of a classic! Great quality DVD.
B00000D9TQ|5.0|This is a package of Phil Collins hits. If you like 80's music then this is a MUST HAVE for your collection. These songs bring back a lot of memories from back in the day. Phil Collins ranks up there with hit makers Billy Joel and Elton John. As another reviewer said, this would be the perfect hits package if it included \\"Don't Lose My Number\\". I feel that radio is losing its relevance so collections like this are important to keep this music alive.
B0015DROBO|4.0|I loved this book it was very interesting. The only thing I didn't like was how long it took to get into it because of all the people he had to introduce and what there story line was.
B004L9MFM2|5.0|I am on the last book of the series and have totaslly enjoyed the series.  I have the first season on DVD but wont watch until I finish the last book.  Higghly recommend for anyone who likes historical, fantasy, sex,blood & gore.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book ranks right up there with Fify Shades of Grey. Loved it! Can't wait for the next book. If you loved Fify shades of Grey, I highly recommend this series!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Love that it shows previous numbers entered. It is easy to use and very helpful for my consultant job. Nice large buttons and numbers for easy viewing.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved everything about this book. Just sad I will have to wait for the 3rd book to be released. If you liked Fifty Shades of Grey, I highly recommend this series!
B00005JOA0|4.0|Started out slow, but liked it as the story started unfolding. Really liked Toby Stevens in Jane Eyre in particular, but it was just a better part I believe.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Enjoyed each book! The stories are well put together. Plenty of intrigue and action to keep me interested. Excellent kindle price as well.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|It's weird...I've been wanting a book like this for sometime and have been waiting for it to come out. Thanks Tim and Amazon.
B008KUDKMC|5.0|Stop watching the tv series. If you like the tv series, you will love the books!  Side note, the kindle version has some editing issues.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I saw the first two seasons on Netflix and I just had to buy this season. I did not like that the season pass only knocks off $0.10 per episode though
B009S8PEHY|5.0|This is a nice addition to my Christmas music collection.  I just wish it included the duet with Dolly Parton.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|He is just a brilliant artist and so refreshing to listen to!  I just love Phillip...what a great entertainer and a great guy.

B0095R64AO|2.0|Thought I'd enjoy this movie, but honestly it just made me sad. Not as funny as I would have hoped.
B00A5IWS5M|4.0|Just remember. You're in somebody's nightmare, not yours. If you could watch a dream it would be weird. Just keep that in mind.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I did like this much more than I expected.  Nice surprise.  The story is timely no matter what side of the pond you live on.
0439023491|5.0|Just as well-paced as &#34;The Hunger Games&#34;, which preceded this book in the trilogy, &#34;Catching Fire&#34; is a true adventure.  The characters have substance, and the action in the book never feels gratuitous.<br /><br />Even though the book is written for a youth, I highly recommend it for adults.
B0083P1QUM|2.0|Patricia Cornwell has always been one of my favorite crime writers and I admit there was a time when I waited in anticipation for her next novel.  However, her complacency is showing.  It seems that her last three book are just &#34;phoned in&#34;.  I am not impressed anymore with the over analytical analysis of autopsies and crime scenes.  I think she tries to impress the reader with that element and not enough on story development.  I doubt that I will be buying any more of Cornwell's books anytime soon.
0439023513|5.0|The final book in &#34;The Huger Games&#34; trilogy was just as action-packed and engaging as the first two.  Having been through so much already with the characters I was sad to see the closing cover approaching.<br /><br />This is a wonderful read for youths and adults alike.
B009SIE6AA|4.0|JT has a really nice mix of songs on this album and they are soft and jazzy, for the most part.<br />When I bought this album, I didn't realize I already owned it.  This is the same album, with a different name and different cover, that  hallmark put out in 2006  ...with the snowy christmas tree scene on the cover called 'a christmas album'.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|You can look at other reviews for info about the movie.  I'm just really pleased with this combo.  It was cheaper than buying digital, and I got DVD, Blu-ray, 3D Blu-ray, digital copy, and a ton of extras.  If you're buying the Avengers, get the four-disc combo.
0316228532|5.0|I knew from the get go that this book was going to receive mixed reviews. I am very acquainted with British literature and humor. I also love a character driven frame story and I am an adult that read Harry Potter as a kid. I hate to even mention the Potter series in conjunction with this book because they are two completely different genres and really should not be compared side by side. So all I'm going to say is that Rowling's style is present in \\"The Casual Vacancy.\\"<br /><br />I honestly think the bad reviews for this book are petty. The reason so many people are uncomfortable with the characters is because they react to situations like real people. The thoughts they have are thoughts that real people have and don't want to admit to having. I personally enjoy British black humor and real world issues. In the real world somebody always loses and a lot of people can't deal with that I suppose.<br /><br />If you want a book with substance and thought provoking, read world themes, then pick up Casual Vacancy. If you like light reading, plot driven, happy ending type books, then don't bother.
B005IZLPME|5.0|Movie was very interesting and put the avengers movie in place. The dislikes about the movie were slim to none.
B008602KQI|4.0|Films of humans-hunting-humans for sport crop up often enough to constitute an entire genre. (Why such flicks are popular is a subject best addressed somewhere other than in an Amazon pocket review.) To name just a few: the granddaddy is the much parodied “The Most Dangerous Game” (1932) in which shipwrecked Joel McCrea and Fay Wray (King Kong’s squeeze in ‘33) are set loose in the jungle to be hunted by the sporting Count Zaroff; in the “The 10th Victim” (1965) contestants willingly compete in the Hunt for prizes, sponsorship deals, fame, and fortune; in “Death Race 2000” drivers in outlandish sports cars score points by killing pedestrians.<br /><br />In “The Hunger Games,” the contestants from 12 districts go out into the wild and vie with each other until only one survives. The sport is followed by everyone in the land. The denizens of the 12 districts, by rooting for their own local contestants, in a peculiar way become invested and implicated in the games and in the society. It is an enjoyable film of its type, though the central character Katniss is a bit too conveniently spared the necessity of killing any sympathetic characters in the games. Those who haven’t read the novels will have to wait to see if she can stay so morally pristine in the upcoming sequel.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book!!!! I was surprised, Thought it was just for adolescents and young adults but no.  I am 38 and LOVED it.  This one is the best one but loved all 3 of them.  Read the trilogy in two weeks (and I work and have 3 kids!). My 9 year old wants to read it but don´t think he should.  Maybe when he turns 12 I will let him.
1619695006|1.0|I can't believe the same person wrote Harry Potter and then wrote this!.  I wish I could return it for being sooooooooooo bad.
B007712XAU|5.0|I´ve watch this 3 times already.  Loves everything about it.  EVERYTHING!!!!  It is the best series ever!!!!  My parents and inlaws also loved it.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|OMG....this movie had me sobbing almost the entire time!  What a beautiful story and so heartbreaking.  I LOVED this movie!  I can watch this over and over again...
0307592731|5.0|I thought it was going to be boring but it is not boring at all.  It is entertaining, insightful, funny, couldn’t put it down.
B009GX6600|4.0|Don't know why but those episodes kept spitting and sputtering, blanking out and then giving me rainbow colors totally unrelated to the picture. I finally gave up and skipped to the 3rd episode because I realized from the summaries that I had seen #1 and 2 when originally aired. The rest of the episodes (up to 7 or 8??) all went well so I finished my planned NCIS marathon enjoyably.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved everything about it.  It is one of the best books I have read.  I couldn´t put them down.  Read the trilogy in about two weeks. Congratulations Suzanne Collins!!!!!
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Love all the songs - there is variation and so you can listen to the whole CD without skipping. It shipped quickly and even came with a free mp3 download code.
B008673ZAQ|2.0|Heated this book.  I did read it until the end but it is just a crazy porn crazy copycat of Fifty Shades.  I loved Fifty Shades (have read the 3 of them twice) and hated this book.  The way they dress!!!!!  Hideous!  Can´t fall in love with a character that dresses that bad. Have to admit this second book is better than the fist one though.
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|My 4 year old grandson asked for this movie, so we downloaded it not knowing what to expect. He had seen the movie before, so he knew what to expect, and told his grandmother and I that it was funny, and, other than the wicked lady, it wasn't scary at all. All three of us really enjoyed it and we all laughed a lot.  My grandson went to sleep during the movie, but we continued to watch it to the end. This is just good family entertainment for 4 and above. The characters are well developed and the action is pretty benign and not scary (as my granson promised). A great find for baby-sitting grandparents.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved everything about it.  It is one of the best books I have read.  I couldn't put them down.  Read the trilogy in about two weeks. Congratulations Suzanne Collins!!!!!
B0012250IM|5.0|This is has great music from the movie.  So much fun and a good change up with Christmas music.  Enjoyable to listen too.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great pastime puzzles that can be a challenge at the upper levels. This is a game you will play and keep.
0345529057|5.0|I watched the HBO show and was motivated to read the books from which it came. The books are more amazing than the HBO series (which did a great job capturing the book).
B009VB97EY|2.0|The content and acting were surprising bad. I remember these times, but this seem to protray the worst side of this world. Not light entertainment.
159562015X|5.0|It is helpful to know and manage from your strengths rather than always trying to compensate for your weaknesses.<br />I would recommend this to anyone.
B00A6N8F4Y|5.0|This is a no holes bared drama. Not for the squeamish. Script  and acting excellent. Be prepared for the world you are entering.
B00447L4JG|5.0|One of my favorite movies! I watch it on Halloween AND Christmas :)<br />Movie was brand new, in perfect condition. Decent price and received in a timely mannor. Thanks!
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|Great app, love the way it works. Keep up the good work.  Just using this App for All my snaps now.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The Racketeer is classic Grisham. It's loaded with action, romance, suspense, and mystery. It's great fun! A real page turner. Like the FBI, I couldn't figure out what the principal character was doing. The only problem with this story is it had to come to an end. If a sequel is planned, I will grab it up as soon as it comes out.
B009J2VR3Y|3.0|I love Whitney and have all of her albums.  I wish these record labels would get more creative in enticing the die-hard fan to purchase these re-releases.  I have no use for this compilation of songs that are on every other compilation.  There has to be other unreleased versions, extended versions, unreleased material, demos, interviews - other add-ons that could make this compilation more interesting, creative and worth purchasing.  Clive ... you can do better!<br /><br />Just my opinion.
B007Y36K46|3.0|some parts actual science but the other 90% out there soo far .... if you like FANTASY with a smidge of science it is a cute love story for certain .... the Queen is truly a stunner and action babe too .
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This was one of my favorite Baldacci books.  I loved Will Robie.  His character was well developed and interesting.  I liked his interaction with the girl - what a team!  I'm looking forward to the next Robie book.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|I work in web development for a university, and my office bought these backpacks for all of our developers. Each of us has a 17\\" laptop, and several of us are also enrolled in classes (I am a full-time employee and full-time student). I have found that this bag has enough room for my personal laptop (17.4\\" HP), work laptop (17\\" MacBook Pro), a 10.1\\" Transformer Prime tablet (with keyboard dock), several binders/books, and all the assorted cables for the above.<br /><br />## Space<br />This backpack holds all of the above without putting any visible strain the seams & zippers. Past backpacks I have used for work and school hold hardly half of the above before they start bulging at the seams. Obviously, like any bag, you want to avoid filling it to the brim with a large number of heavy items (I rarely carry all of the above items at the same time), but the fact that this bag is capable of holding just about everything in your house is a major plus.<br /><br />## Sturdy<br />In addition to being a virtual black hole of space, the bag stands on its own fairly well. The bottom, as others have mentioned, is made of a plastic/fake leather material that is not only water resistant (I haven't tested precisely how resistant), but also helps the bag hold its shape when mostly empty. It may not seem like a very big deal, but not having my backpack fall face-down on the floor every time I set it down has been quite nice. It is definitely one of those features that you don't realize how good it really is until it's there (or until you lose it).<br /><br />## Minor Gripes<br />I only have a couple minor issues with the backpack, though they are both relatively minor. Whenever I travel, I like to put locks on all the zippers of my backpacks. I know this will not prevent a thief/pickpocket from simply cutting my bag to get at anything within, but it helps discourage the less-motivated (and less prepared) thieves. Unfortunately, the zippers on this backpack don't leave much space for a lock. It's not a major issue for me, but if this sort of thing is higher on your priority list, be aware that you may need to get different locks (or possibly forego any kind of locks on the zippers). The second item has been mentioned a couple of times, and that is the lack of a removable pouch for your laptop. As with the zipper \\"issue\\", this is relatively minor. The laptop compartment is VERY easy to get to, and removing your laptop from this bag is not a difficult thing to do. If you wanted to put your computer in a pouch before putting it in the laptop compartment of this bag, I am sure that would work nicely (though I can't be more specific, not having tried). Finally, as someone mentioned, there is no cross strap to connect the two shoulder straps of the backpack. When it's loaded to the brim, it would be nice to have an extra strap in the front. When I have had this strap on past backpacks, I noticed that the bag became significantly easier to carry when fully loaded, because the weight was distributed better. This greatly reduced the strain on my shoulders and back.<br /><br />## One More Thing<br />Lastly, I want to comment on something I have seen a few other reviewers mention, and that is the issue regarding the straps being too small for some people. Admittedly, I don't have the build of a pro wrestler or football player. But I have always had very broad shoulders and a somewhat \\"barrel\\" chest. ANY backpack I use (including this one), is always a little awkward for me to put on and/or take off, because my shoulders and arms simply don't bend in a way that gives me much flexibility or dexterity when it comes to reaching behind me. That said, once I have the backpack on, the straps are quite comfortable, and I have not noticed any discomfort coming from either the weight of the bag or the way the straps fit. I tend to walk to and from class (1/3 to 1/2 mile each way on our moderately sized college campus), so even minor comfort issues tend to present themselves after awhile. I haven't noticed any problems with this bag.<br /><br />## Summary<br />Overall, I think this backpack is a perfect choice for someone needing good build quality and plenty of space. I will be ordering one for my wife, an art student who needs to carry around numerous books, a laptop, and art supplies. I'm also seriously considering getting a couple extra backpacks to keep at home for when we start having kids, just in case this bag isn't around in 10 years. Yes, it's that good.hemselves after awhile.

B009A9ETFE|5.0|Whether you are just getting into HIM or have been a longtime HIM fan, this is a great album. The only thing I dislike is the fact that the songs are all radio edits. Only one new song, which is the cover of Strange World. But it is a very well put together greatest hits. This is their second greatest hits, with ..And Love Said No being thier first. Can't wait for more from this amazing band!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|The Walking Dead has finally lived up to its potential. Great action, surprise after surprise. Finally, the walking dead lives..
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Perfect sequel and great ending to the legendary Batman trilogy from Nolan. Exemplary screenplay, well inter-connected scenes, Tom Hardy rocks!
1615470158|5.0|I don't usually reference Monty Python in a book review, but this one is pretty darn close to the holy grail.    I had been playing around with PowerPivot for a few months before I stumbled upon Rob's awesome blog ([...]) and considered myself ahead of the curve since no one else in my company had even heard of PowerPivot. I enjoyed his writing style, so I thought his book would be interesting and might help me fill in some of the gaps in my knowledge. Boy, was I wrong.    As it turns out, I knew NOTHING about PowerPivot and what it could do. Rob truly has a gift for explaining things in such a way that makes it easy to understand without feeling talked down to. He walks you through all of the cool features and usually gives multiple examples of how to use each of them. I never thought I could be entertained by reading a book about an Excel add-in (although it's baked into Excel 2013), but this one managed to do just that. He also lets you know that it's okay to get excited about data and what can be done with PowerPivot.    So, I would highly recommend buying this book if you have any reason at all to use Excel for your job. Rob can show you how to get noticed and become a data Rockstar. (that's a real thing...)
B003O85W44|5.0|Won album of the year and surely deserves it. Arcade Fire create a sound, and a feeling, through this effective and excellent theme album
B008458O3S|5.0|This game is easy to learn but gets VERY challenging, especially in the bonus levels! Finding solutions to some of the puzzles can be very frustrating but the mechanics of the game are simple enough that you always feel like youre close to getting it, so when you finally do it feels great!! I admit i have watched and rewatched some of my more complex solutions over and over out of amazement and pride, which isn't a typical response to most puzzle games. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who loves a good mental challenge!
B009OYSFDM|4.0|Love the pilot and first few episodes but the show is becoming less action more drama. They need to show the 5 years on the island more.
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|Fun game. Thanks cool geeks. Liked the puzzles the story and just when you think the game is going to end like shorter games (we wont mention) it keeps going. Couldn't put it down! MORE PLEASE!!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Like the game, great to occupy time.  Advertising pop ups make me not want to buy.  Please give better play instructions.
B003Y5H574|5.0|Excellent movie and funny enough to watch over and over again. Even better, I bought it on black friday for $4
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I love playing all the angry bird games. Bad Piggies is a great twist. It is a much harder game for sure but enjoy building all the contraptions.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This game works very well on my New Kindle tablet, It runs smooth and fast with now crashes.  I like it.
B0041KVWI4|1.0|I was very fascinated and overwhelmed with the jacket illustrations and art but I am very disappointed at the quality of these pressings! Myself being an audiophile and i own a hi-end audiophile system retail valued @ $15,000.00 Magical Mystery is supposed to 180 grams, it isn't its more like 150 grams more or less, I noticed as soon as I felt the girth because I do own many 180 gram virgin vinyls of all genres. So, I don't know if that was a factory mistake or is it a fact or fiction as I read on Amazon.com that each and every record is supposed to have been tested in Abbey Road Labs before packaging and sent to stores? The Sgt Peppers is 180 grams but it falls short because I do own the original Sgt peppers on capitol label stereo and mono versions that are very valuable. These new versions are supposed to be virgin vinyls meaning the sound-stage, hi's and lows and warmth should be better than the originals, they sound like CD's. And if I had read the fine print on the sticker on the front in the beginning, that these versions were taken from digital masters, I would have never got em. Analog should be true analog that's is my opinion.<br /><br />The RAM album reviews:<br />It lacked quality and the album art was so plain :(<br />I want to be satisfied, I am not. I work hard for my money and with the economy as poor as it is, I can't afford to waste my funds in this case my money was wasted.<br /><br />SO PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON ANY BEATLES RELATED RECORDS/VINYLS. I TRIED CONTACTING CUSTOMER SERVICE FROM BEATLES.COM AND THEY COULDN'T HELP ME WHICH MEANS THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THERE CUSTOMERS !!!
B008MEM24S|5.0|Love it, love it after trying free version I purchased the other levels I'm. Done with them cant wait for more
B009410J9I|5.0|IF YOU'RE A STRAY CATS FAN, YOU'LL LOVE THIS EARLY CONCERT FOOTAGE. SETZER PLAYS MORE TO THE ORIGINAL SOUND RECORDINGS, UNLIKE A LOT OF THE B.S.O. CONCERT FOOTAGE YOU SEE TODAY. THEY EVEN DO A VERSION OF GENE VINCENT'S PRETTY PRETTY BABY, WHICH THEY NEVER RECORDED. FOR THIS PRICE IT'S A GREAT ADDITION TO A COLLECTION. - C.C.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I am a angry birds lover so any bee versions. That come out I well purchase can't get enough angry birds
B009X01ELC|5.0|The case is perfect for a variety of uses, the handy little hand strap allows you to hold the tablet sort of like a baseball mit and you can even swivel it around to get it just right for viewing. I found it to be incredibly useful when I'd tilt the tablet to a more natural holding position with my hand naturally going out on an angle, and adjusting the tablet for either portrait or landscape usage accordingly. Its very ergonomic and even includes 3 notches so that you can prop the tablet up for movie or document viewing, it actually has 2 of these notches so that you can prop it up in either portrait or landscape mode. I certainly recommend this case to anyone looking for a functional well designed case! It does add some serious girth to the tab, making an otherwise svelte tablet a little chunkier with the case on, but the added protection, style, and functionality far outweigh the added thickness (and the weight increase is minimal if noticeable at all).
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|So yeah, as always the Angry Bird creators came up with another fun way to keep me mindlessly distracted at bedtime.  I enjoy this version the best so far and have actually found myself trying to beat my high score on completed levels (I never really cared to do that previously).  The &#34;Luke&#34; character is my favorite, wielding a light saber.  I am still trying to perfect &#34;Obi-wan's&#34; use of the force.  I just played it for the first time last night and got to the R2-D2 level..  You can bet I'm gonna try to get a higher score count on that one.  It probably isn't really that tricky, but at midnight for a tired mom, it is...
B0063GORYU|4.0|I absolutly love this app!!!  I am on my tablet alot and this game keeps me occupied on my down time.  I would definitely recommend downloading this app!!!!  Thank You MobilityWare.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I have this on my smart phone. Occasionally the books don't download properly to it but it works most of the time quite well.
B009FB3WQ4|5.0|Brilliant entertainment but the show itself was appallingly edited. Even if you are not a Streisand fan the other acts are first class.
B00914JWSW|4.0|But I could see why some of these were not released.  While her voice is strong and pure, some of the songs just don't seem to fit in her catalogue.
B009O2XY12|4.0|Fun game. The kid loved it too.. although I think I am playing it more than the 8yr old! Bubbles  are addicting!
8866130931|5.0|I've used this particular Moleskine calendar for the last four years because it meets my requirements perfectly--week days on the left with plenty of room to enter appointments and a blank ruled page on the right for notes.
0071766588|4.0|I have sent this to students in Russia, Asia and Eastern Europe wishing to prepare for TOEFL testing to apply for universities in the U.S. and elsewhere - or just improve their english comprehension.  To a person, they all liked it, scored high while not perfect - in the upper percentages of the TOEFL.  Their approval and feedback tells me it is helpful.
0525953728|1.0|One of the worst books I have ever read for three reasons:<br />1. Sophmoric language and prose<br />2. Authorc clearly taking advantage of a situation delivered to him<br />3. Highly disrespectful of the President with no basis<br /><br />The author is clearly a low-life
1423117166|5.0|It is an absolutely beautiful book. Perfect for disney and animation enthusiasts alike. I'll definitely be buying the rest in the series
B0071XO8RA|5.0|One of the best post apocalyptic stories I have read in a long time.  Great characters with a story line that pulls you in.
B007FRHZ4A|5.0|I have seen this game or a variation thereof for ages in the store.  My youngest son is obsessed with the app and when we got this game I was impressed with the whole thing. My son loves it!  You can play it as intended or just do your own thing. The pieces are made well. We havent had it for long, but so far there are no complaints.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|Rod Stewart just keeps getting better. His voice is raspy, yet smooth as silk.  Love the duets!  One of his best yet.
B00A992W9Y|4.0|I really like Ke$ha and I think that this is a great CD.  It's got a lot of fun songs that put you in a party mood.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have read all of the Rapp series and this is one of the better books.  Why is Amazon making me write more words?
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|I really enjoyed this game.  Beautiful graphics, fun puzzles.  Good value  for the money.  The way a game should be. Nice job!
0141329394|4.0|This book was used as an example of English literature of the period in an English Literature class for 8th graders which I teach.  All of the young readers enjoyed the book and I am very pleased with the quality of the item and the children's responses to it.
B0053O89JM|5.0|It's a shame, somewhere in either season six or seven, they lost viewers due to some poor script writing.... because season 8 made up for it. This last season was one of my favourites, especially the last episode. Just in case there are some people that haven't seen it yet and would still like to, I won't spoil it. I'll just say that this was a great season and it's too bad that it was its' last. We will definitely miss HOUSE, m.d..
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Don't see what the hype is for. It's a decent story with a ton of gratuitous sex. The problem is that I don't really feel for the characters.
B008NMT684|5.0|My three year old grandson is smart and active, and when he's bored, we call him Mini Taz (because he can wreck a room as fast as the cartoon version of Tasmanian Devil! I gave him this game to play on my Kindle, and he sat quietly for an hour, moving puzzle pieces!
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book had me captured from the very beginning.  On reading the final page I kept trying to turn the page to read more.  Surely there was more, because this cannot be the ending.  It was.  Good story, great plot, held my interest...lousy ending.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I have been watching DVDs for years, so it was with great excitment that I heard Marvel was going to release their smash hit \\"The Avengers\\" onto the digital video disc.<br /><br />Now, I ain't much of Robert Downey Jr. guy but I love Sammy Jackson and I once ate at the same restaurant at Mark Ruffalo. I like that Captain America holds up good old fashioned American values and that the Hulk can be reasoned with. I did not care for Bill Bixby's Hulk very much and Eric Banyon and Ed Norton's weren't much better neither.<br /><br />Scarlett Johanson is not much of an actress but you don't have to be when you have a figure like that. Though I don't care much for her nose, so I wish she would get rhinoplasty. Which reminds me, when is The Rhino going to be the villain in one of the SpiderMan movies.  If he ever is I am going to \\"charge\\" out and see it ASAP and I'll probably use a credit card to pay for the ticket (charge it? Get it?)<br /><br />I did once have a dream that Thor and I got married and he let me play with his hammer and you should have seen the smile on his face.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|This app should have come free with the kindle fire hd.  It's like having to buy a reading app to make the kindle work.  The camera came with the unit and should have been fully useable from the start.  The camera is ok not the easiest unit to use.  There should have been a camera on the other side like a phone so you can see what you are taking a picture of.  More thought needs to go into this in the future.
B001EBWITA|4.0|Held my attention unlike many movies! I can't wait to watch it again and I hope they make a second!!!
B0076DEJMO|5.0|As is typical in Abercrombie's stand-alone novels, we have some new characters and some who are returning.  This is good, unclean, violent fun that continues to hammer in Abercrombie's usual themes of moral ambiguity, revenge, redemption and utter lack thereof...<br /><br />I found this to be one of Abercrombie's better works.  Despite the Western theme, he is generally treading what is for him familiar ground, but he does a good job and I had a lot of fun watching him do it.
B0000E6XH3|5.0|My 12 year old daughter really loves this anime (so do I) but it is no longer available on youtube. I was very pleased to see it for sale on Amazon.com. It'll be a great Christmas gift for my daughter (and me)!
034580404X|5.0|And yet my daughter-in-law insisted I read at least her copy of the first book (she hadn't even finished it yet when she loaned it to me!). As you can see, I bought the trilogy boxed set and I had finished all of the before my daughter-in-law could get halfway through the second book! People will tell you it's all about bondage but that is so far from the truth! It's so well worth the read that I can't say anymore than that. Read it! You'll love it! You'll fall head over heels in love with Christian and Anastasia! I'm even thinking about buying the audio books as well. That's saying something for me!
B007REW8DO|5.0|Christina Perri has a beautiful voice (not all auto-tuned) and the melodies to the songs are simply gorgeous.  They are also unique enough that the tunes don't sound all the same.  I love the use of piano in her songs...an instrument not used much nowadays.
B005LAIH54|5.0|Out of the two in this movie series, this is the best one yet. It even leaves room for a third movie to come out later (hopefully sooner though). I would definitely buy this video again if anything were to happen to this copy of it!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This CD contains my favorite Piano Guys songs,  a mix of popular tunes played by more classical instruments.  I am not dissapointed.
B007Y6OZE0|5.0|Awesome. That's all there needs to be said about The Album and the band. These song I can listen to over and over again. A very fun and awesome album
B000YHG72E|4.0|Rented this movie for Christmas, appropriately funny for kids and adults. Would definitely watch this movie over and over again.
B004U8VWLE|5.0|Who Dosnt won't to see two girls eating themselves out? Not only that, they are both two hot girls doing it. Lol.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|The book kept me very interested can't wait for the 3rd one to come out in May!!! Just wished I would have waited to read the set until May when the new one comes out.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|flexible inner arrangement, but there is no special part designed for camera body.<br />It is either too small for a macbook or too big for only camera and accessaries.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Excelente producto pasta t&eacute;rmica para el control de la temperatura del CPU. Lo recomiendo 100% para el mantenimiento del mismo
B0091574VI|5.0|Great documentary, well narrated.<br />Good material for all ages. We had our two daughters watch it (2 and 3 year-olds) and they loved it.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app works great on our Kindle for all the places we visit plus check on weather in other parts<br />of the country where our family members live. very pleased with it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was a gift for my husband and daughter to read. They very much enjoyed the book and I am happy!
075669812X|5.0|My grandson was thrilled with the book, and the mini ninjago! He carries it wherever he goes, so it's obviously a hit! Fast service as well! 5 Star!
B005LQ6UE8|5.0|This is a tale which once you start you cannot put down.  The true account of a group of men who walked, during WW2, from a Russian Gulag in the Arctic Circle, travelling  south, they crossed the Gobi Dessert, climbed over the Himalayan mountains losing people along the way, facing starvation, death from thirst they persevered.  It is a riveting story , almost unbelievable but obviously true.  Could you imagine yourself doing it, ?  what power of the human spirit.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|this app is very fun and i enjoy using it to make collages to save and put on facebook. if u havent already, i think you should get this app.
B001UV4XUG|4.0|The order showed up on time. Matter of fact, this was the first of twelve orders to arrive last month. My daughter was very pleased. This movie arrived soon enough that she didn't need to hunt the same movie down in stores...to get it on time as a Christmas gift for her boyfriend.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|Was okay, just not as good as the first two. Did have a surprising twist at the end, which is why I gave it three stars.
B007C7UZIG|1.0|I really had trouble settring up steam to use the game.  I don't know why Amazon would use this product to sell games.  Even after I was able to set up steam, I still have problems opening the game to play.  I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone.
B00914JWSW|5.0|Love Barbra and 99% or her music. This is no exception. I hope that you will enjoy it as much as I do.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Read this book, it will give you peace and a better understanding of transition. This book speaks to your spirit. It is inspiring!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I enjoy reading John Grisham. This is just another example of his great legal novels.<br />It is my first download to my Kindle. Simple and easy to do.
B0000AUHPK|5.0|I've always liked this interpretation better than the 1950s version because it is more faithful to the book. While it still veers off into the romance-angle too much (it IS a Hollywood production), I find it useful to show to clarify some of the narration and plot sequence for students reading the novel.
B0037471TE|3.0|I bought this book because I enjoyed the Bourne series of movies, but I was surprised to see how far from the book the movies actually are. I found the story a little slow in the begining and it took me some time to adjust to the pace of the book. I like books that are into the action from the start gate. Overall I enjoyed the story and for the sake of curiosity I have decided to read the follow on books too.
B0000AM6IY|5.0|I was surprised to find that this musical has been sidelined in the classroom in favor of all the Andrew Lloyd Webber productions and &#34;High School Musical&#34; and &#34;Grease&#34; renditions. I was suspecting my students would find it to be to hokey and old-fashioned (as a follow-up to reading and watching Romeo and Juliet), but they were absolutely riveted and were inspired by how powerful a reinterpreted story could be. It helped them to be more creative when I had them reinterpret the story in their own ways.
B008FRFN7A|4.0|App works great with smartphone, Kindle Fire and IPad. App is great but kept my Wi Fi  Kodak printer as second printer because pics printed by it are sharper/better than the HP printer required to AirPrint. I only wish Kodak could AirPrint! If HP printer quality was better I would give their app five stars!
0812550706|4.0|I like the book, it was a good read. really easy and fun and perfect for my 12 hour flight home. arrived in good condition
0312641893|5.0|Cinder by Marissa Meyer was surprisingly better than I thought it would turn out.  I thought I would just like it, but I really loved it.  I could not put it down and after reading it all, I want to know more of the story.  Even though I guessed the biggest spoiler at the end, I did not see other things that happened in the book.  For instance, not to give anything major away, I did not expect a scene with a sick elderly woman dying from the plague and the androids having to cut open her arm to take an ID chip out.  I liked the fact the book had more violence then most young adult books have.  It makes the book mature rather than too adolescent.<br /><br />Another thing I really enjoyed about this book was the characters.  May favorite character was Linh Cinder obviously, but the only issue with her is we do not really get to see what she really looks like.  We know Cinder is a cyborg living in a futuristic China, but that is about it.  She is a mechanic and she has no interest in much of anything but her work and escaping.  We do not get to know too much about her family.  She has a strict stepmother, one of the stepsisters is a bitch and the other is the kinder one, and she has an android named Iko.  Iko is my favorite from her family because at times you just wanted Iko for your own.<br /><br />The real trouble starts when she meets Prince Kai and we start to see the similarities between Linh Cinder and Cinderella.  Yes, this is a retelling of the Cinderella story but with a cyberpunk twist.  The main reason I was attracted to this novel was the fact it twisted the Cinderella story to something of my interest.  I like the fairy tale retellings, but I have to admit that I do not like most of the Cinderella ones.  This one I loved.  I know it says in the flap of the cover that she is a fan of anime and Sailor Moon, but I saw similarities to Fullmetal Alchemist and Ghost in the Shell as well.  I give Meyer big props for influencing her work on fairy tales and animerather than what most young adult books base their books on.<br /><br />One thing I should point out before I finish my review, the book was horribly advertised.  I suggest you do not watch the YouTube trailer because you will get the wrong impression of the book as I did.  The trailer made the book have a Twilight feel to it and focused more on the romance between Cinder and the Prince.  Wikipedia and bunch of other places categorized this book as a romance.  The romance is in the book, but it is not the focus of the book at all.  I would say it is about a cyborg trying to find her place in the human world.  Do not be deceived by the cover or her last name.  This book is in no way like Twilight.  The story is mature and very original.
0525478817|5.0|I'd read John Green's Paper Towns before reading this book, so I was anxious to see if it was as good as Paper Towns, and boy was it. I had read the last page before reading the book. Why? Because I like to make guesses about what happens in the book based off of what the last page says and let's just say that my guess was completely off in a sad and bittersweet way. I thoroughly enjoyed reading from Hazel's point of view because we think alike in some respects and it's really nice to find someone who thinks like I do, even if they're not actually real or not. The strange thing about this book is I lent it to my mother once I was done with it, and while she was reading it (she's a nurse) had a patient admitted that had the same issues as Augustus right down to the very small details surrounding him. He was the same age as Gus was, too, and ultimately had the same fate that Gus does. This book is a tear-jerker at some moments and makes you think about what your legacy will be when you leave Earth, whether you usually have those thoughts or not. If you haven't read this book before, I highly recommend it.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|it is awesome I use it everynight. I love that it has multiple alarms.I also love the music that plays. I really cant wait to use it again
B009HEJXFS|3.0|WHAT PLOT? WE DON'T NEED NO STINKING PLOT? THIS ONE LINE AND PEOPLE STILL TALK ABOUT TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE. OF COURSE, THERE WAS A LOT MORE TO STORY TELLING IN THE MOVIE THAN THAT, WHAT DOES THIS FAST FOOD MOVIE HAVE TO REMEMBER?
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|its a good time passing game.<br />like it because u can stopn without loosing the whole thing.<br />it also has lots of levels so if your stuck try another one.<br />if u like this game I recommend bad piggy's 2.
0714843377|5.0|Very cute pocket book.<br />It's nice and interesting to read. Everybody that has seen it here at home want it.
B005NFW0U0|4.0|The feature quality and sound are excellent. I did not have any issues watching any episodes that were included in this season. What I like about buying these products is that I don't have to worry about losing or accidentally breaking it, like I would a DVD. This will stay on my account forever and it's comforting to know that :)  Thanks Amazon!
081297381X|4.0|I bought it as a present and in a hurry. The vendor didn't disappoint me, it was delivered in perfect timing.<br />The book itself it's kinda cheap, materially speaking.<br /><br />Well, the person who got it, loved it! So I'm very satisfied.
B004JMY312|5.0|The feature quality is really good! I've loved this movie since I was a child and my family continues to watch it every year as a Halloween tradition.
1600595871|5.0|I took so long searching and buying craft books for handmade books and this is the best of them.<br />It's amazing how organized and easy it is to follow the instructions. And it has more than a 100 models, it's a lot of fun.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|hope this works when needed - right?  This light is definitely very bright.  Not sure about using it as a flashlight outside of the house.
0316069434|4.0|I'm not a big fan of cop stories.  I can take em or leave em.  As I am always looking for some decent authors whose books end up on CD(my job allows me a lot of time to listen to things and there is only so much popular music I can take), when someone told me about Connelly last year, I thought I'd check him out. I'm not a big fan of police stories, but if I have nothing better to listen to, Connelly is OK.  This book is better than average. At least, it's good enough until something better comes along.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|AMAZING!!!!!!!!!! I Really enjoyed this season 3, the best so far. I can not wait for the next episode :P
B009D5VNLS|5.0|My granddaughter saw this movie at the Theater and has been watching it ever since, she loves the characters and the plot.
1439153663|4.0|This book was one of the selections for the book club I'm in.  I had never heard of the book before, but really enjoyed reading it.  There are some historical parts of the story that I had no idea about, so it was definitely eye opening in that respect.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I like the hunger games series it's so good me and my kids like to the hunger games movies and cant wait to read the last book!  :)
0345803485|3.0|I had to read this book just to see what all the buzz was about.  Although the &#34;scenes of interest&#34; (the reason why everyone's reading this series) are well written, I find that the rest of the book is lacking in writing style, depth, etc.  Not one of my favorites...
B00AC8ZJPQ|5.0|*Warning I am typing spoilers in my review sorry^ It was better then I thought it would be. It was really good. The actors & actresses were very convincing. I loved every minute of it, I just wish that it was longer. Because after seeing all there squad get slaughtered & oh boy lost his girl that he loved, I wanted to see him break his foot off in those Alien enemy soldier's B*tts. I hope there are many more because it rocked & Master Chief is the man as always. Watch it you will love it. I just hppe they make more in the near future.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|A very sexy book filled with interesting twists and turns.  I enjoyed this book because it was easy to follow and fun!
B005LF9OCE|5.0|I know a lot of folks have written about this being a particularly dark season, but I thought it was funny and insightful!
B000SEGUDE|4.0|It seems to happen quite often that a movie release clues me into a book (or books) that I would not have previously read.  This was not the best of those occasions (&#34;Game of Thrones&#34;) but it certainly wasn't the worst.<br /><br />As a casual reader, it took me quite a while to get through the first two sections, which are set in the 18th and early 19th centuries.  One thing I will say about David Mitchell is that I am amazed at how he can change his writing style to uniquely fit the period of the story.  Having said that, I remember why I don't read other &#34;classic&#34; books because I really have trouble getting into a flow with that writing style.<br /><br />Conversly, coming to the 5th and 6th sections gave me more of the sci-fi style to which I am more accustomed.  Needless to say these were my two favorite stories.  You then continue back down the ladder, and I think what kept me going was seeing how the stories would subsequently link together.  This is where I was a little let down however.  I'm not sure why, I just thought there would be more to it.  I won't give anything else away.<br /><br />Overall, I think it was worth a read, but don't think I'll ever get the itch to go back and re-read it.  And in this case it didn't convince me that I need to go see the movie (along with some of the mixed reviews I've heard).
B0095R64AO|3.0|This movie was funny at times and cute, but disappointing considering how much I loved Forgetting Sarah Marshall.  It was too long and not funny enough.
1439152802|5.0|Kate Morton just gets the job done. Whatever premise she establishes to teach the reader is accomplished. Her books are long - yet you have a problem setting them aside because the plot lines are complex with always a teachable moment. Each of her books represents a great moral journey, that upon completion, each reader sighs with  appreciation for the brilliant writing and lesson learned
1401902197|5.0|WHEN LIVING IN A WORLD THAT CAN BE SEEMINGLY NEGATIVE,<br />IT IS NICE TO READ A BOOK THAT IS SO FILLED WITH SUCH<br />ENCOURAGEMENT AS YOU CAN DO IT. CAN IS SUCH A POSITIVE<br />WORD. THIS REMINDS ME OF SOME OF THE POSITIVE WISDOM<br />SIMILARLY WRITTEN IN THE WORKS OF DIANA NEIDERHISER.
B005LAII08|5.0|I love all Disney Pixar movies and this one is no exception.<br />I had pre-ordered this movie and had no issues (as usual) receiving it.<br />Packaging was good and it arrived the day of release.<br />I have no complaints at all.
B004GJDQT8|3.0|SINCE WE USUALLY USE THE APP STORE WE HAVE NOT YET USED THIS AS MUCH AS WE WILL IN THE FUTURE.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|Couple of good action scenes, but other than that I was wondering why am I watching an old broken down Batman...
1451613512|5.0|The polarization of thought in a subjective reality. That is a malady afflicting the U.S. and disturbingly totalitarian societies. The truth void of spin/propoganda/disinformation/ignorance/hubris is a tool to create a equitable environment,  potentialy a stable country. Thanks for the effort to thwart decline of an immigant populace and it's genocidal conduct towards other peoples native to occupied/stolen land.  Liked the book as it shed light on the true conduct of the U.S. of A.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|I've been looking forward to this release since Phillip Phillips won American Idol. I was not disappointed! I would recommend it to a friend.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|came with no problems.  have used this vendor numerous times.  this is a great movie! really enjoy watching it with family
B0063IH60K|5.0|Who doesn't like solitaire?  It is one of those games that anyone can play and enjoy.  It also does not require alot of skill.  Up my alley
B000MQC9H4|5.0|can't get enough christmas movies.  this is one i really like. came very timely with no problems with the vendor
B004WR125O|2.0|This LAN Adapter installed pretty easily like any plug and play device. But performace was horrible. I tried using the apps on my droid device, iphone and had a poor perfomance, delayed response. On top of it, very basic functionality.<br /><br />I have a external hard drive connected to my router so I can access my files, movies, photos etc from any computer on my personal network. This device failed to recognize the hard disk through the DLNA option. Don't waste your money.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|A good story, well told. Grisham has a light breezy style and cleverly ties up loose ends. Fun to read .
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I loved receiving this quickly and watching. I loved how closely it followed the book. The movie was so good.
B0033VUH6A|5.0|I think this may be one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. The tension felt urgent and real, the people felt like real people not just characters, the writing, the directing, the story, the effects--all great.
B001NLKT60|5.0|I read the first book in the trilogy and really liked it.  I was worried things could go downhill for the series, but after started reading this book, started liking it better than the first.  I'm finishing this book up now and can't wait to read the third.
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|Cute movie. Both my 4 year old and 1 year old like this movie. They laugh at the sloth and they really like the dinos in it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Not that I've watched that many TV series.  In fact, I discontinued my TV service a few months ago after not watching TV for six months.  After joining Amazon Prime this fall so I could downstream movies on my computer, I decided to explore this BBC/PBS partnership I'd heard about.  I immediately became a Downton Abbey junkie, watching episode after episode nonstop for several evenings until I'd gone through Seasons 1 and 2.  How disappointed I was that Season 3 was just then airing in the UK and wouldn't be released in America until January, 2013!  How happy I was yesterday to watch the trailer for Season 3!  Just twenty-eight days until America hits the Downton Abbey Season 3 jackpot!  Yea!  The trailer gives every indication that Season 3 will be as enjoyable, as mesmerizing, as addictive as the first two seasons were.  Our British cousins certainly know how to produce an Emmy-quality period drama.  The writers, the producer and every single actor deserve awards.  What incredible talent!  How Maggie Smith's typically British, ironic zingers make me laugh out loud.  How tantalizing is the peek we get of Maggie opposite America's home-grown Shirley MacCain.  As the Brits are fond of saying, &#34;Brilliant!&#34;  I'm counting the days until I can watch the witty sparks fly between these two titans of British and American film.
B0009P5YXO|2.0|My kid likes it, but for that price I expected something more substantial, better built.  It's fragile and doesn't do much (gee, an LED lights up).  It's lame.
B001JNNDEW|5.0|I already own this movie, I feel like it portrays my life. I watch this and laugh hysterically each time. It's not for everyone though, some people I have seen sit through this with a straight face.<br />Now I own it in HD on blu-ray!!!! I also really enjoyed the extra footage and the interviews, I have never gotten to see those before.
B0096CDG0O|5.0|I like how not very much time or thought goes into a turn. Way better than WWF! It's just like yahtzee.
B00009APK1|5.0|Couldn't wait to get my hands on this and add to my evergrowing collection. Can't wait to add to this series.
B006UAWH2S|2.0|Only if you are an Ewan McGregor groupie and have nothing to do should you spend time watching this. It will put you asleep better than any drug.
B0000BWVCJ|5.0|Love the XMEN!!!!!!!!  Great Movie, can't wait for the next one to come out. Plenty of action and suspense. I highly recommend it.
B000LB7G00|4.0|This device is a real time saver. I would like to be able to consign different functions to the two buttons on it.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|Awesome movie, Matt Damon is the man in this movie. Great action, never a dull moment. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time watching this. I highly recommend this movie.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|Have not had a problem yet.  Good app to have to clean up after yourself.  Thursday is field day for me.
6304711905|5.0|I enjoyed watching Tombstone, and truly enjoyed the actors as they are some of my favorites. If you like Westerns you like this movie. Plenty of action and many scenes are comical.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Easy way to keep intouch with my family and friends when I travel. Love the quality of contents I post.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|loved the movies and now i love the game. i cant get enough of it and cant wait for the new movie.
B004H83IM8|1.0|I gave it one star because the dvds wouldn't play In Ireland be careful, I think it only works in America. Hope this helps.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|very nice its a must for everithing because you can use it almost af any isue hou need. As much as it is related on cloud netwirking.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|My toddler loves it. It keeps her busy for a while. I would recommend it for any parent to try. I don't like it as much
B0098VXMNE|5.0|Loved this as much as season 1, better than season 0.  Wow.  Rarely am I transfixed by the TV but this did it.  Have to take my hat off to the writers. Love seeing what life may have been like (at least in some ways) back then.  Spartacus, the character, is awesome and this new actor is 99% as good as the previous (who I adored) and occasionally better.  Have fun!
B00AA7O6QC|4.0|If you are looking for a good shoot 'em up then this is one worth watching. All the old action stars pull off enough stunts to make it enjoyable. Plenty of things do get blown up, and that's why we watch these movies in the first place. It's great to see many of the older action stars, even though they are past their prime, in one movie. Just don't expect much of a plot.
1419705849|1.0|I order a book on october 3 2012, it was to be release november 11. Today is December 10 and I am still waiting. Don't use the international service.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|What can you say about this classic Christmas movie....everyone should see it at least once! It makes you feel all warm & fuzzy inside & you've got to have the Christmas spirit after watching it!
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Who doesn't love The Godfather?  I was still watching on my ancient VHS.  Yay for blu ray! Three more words
B00A8ECU24|4.0|the graphics are good. and the details are awesome and cute. too bad the characters don't talk more but still a good game.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Outstanding app on our android phones and my wife's Kindle. We use it daily. It is helpful woith Bible study and daily readings.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|I will not talk about the series itself, 'cause if you're buying this one product, probably you already know how good the tv show is. But this special edition is just fantastic.<br /><br />An almost real size head, which comes with a screwdriver to put through the zombie's eye. The head material is really good, all the details on the head make it looks really real and scary.<br /><br />Definitely a must-buy for the TWD fans to have a zombie head on their shelves.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|I was most impressed by how quickly I received this shipment!  It was packaged with ease to open and I know that my husband will love it as part of his Christmas gifts.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|They alleviated the slowness of season 2 and went went into this season with guns blazing (literally) and haven't let up on the action or on the suspense. I highly recommend this season!
B005PW3OS8|3.0|This movie in my opinion lacks all the things that a good movie would have in it. First ,a great story line,secondly,seat gluing action.And last it lacks 2 stars from being a movie that I love.
B007STXHTM|5.0|I've been filming all my dives since I have the GoPro. Definitely the GoPro won't be of use if you don't have this housing (something no one will tell you!). So, if you're planning to use the GoPro underwater, the case is a must. Period.
1442359315|5.0|An amazing account of NDE, the best I have heard (this was the audio version). The book is read by the Doctor himself, describing his experience, from his point of view.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn's best book with Mitch Rapp at his meanest!  I picked the book up and never put it down until it was finished.  Unbelievably fast paced, the book grabs hold of you and doesn't let go!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Hard to believe this was a first novel...how will she top it?  Unusual story, albeit a love story at last, with  some unresolved issues when it came to the &#34;who-done-its&#34;.  I still don't know why the &#34;its&#34; were done... Anyway, I found the story charming, exceptionally beautiful, and could easily visualize the circus as depicted.  I heartily recommend it for a most unusual and visual read, even if one is not a circus fan.  Contains a lot of interesting characters and would make a great movie!
B00574P9EQ|5.0|We are grown-ups and we love the series! Really funny stuff and I imagine kids love them! Great actors in the making on all those kids!
B00633W614|3.0|always liked J.Archer.  Read the first book of this chronicle and wanted to find out what was going to happen with the various characters.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|OMG! Season two is heavier than season one! who comes up with this??? NOT for minors!!!<br />Really mind bending stuff and great actors!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|The most fun I ever had cooking! Love the holiday themes, it would be nice if they came up sooner though... Love it!
B0063GORYU|4.0|I really enjoy playing solitaire. Spider solitaire is challenging and makes you plan moves in advance.<br />The free version only uses one suite of cards. It would be better with all four suites of the deck.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|I thought that it was a great movie, it captured my attention and held on to it until the end. I rate it 5***** and more if I could.
B000SXLL8O|5.0|I think this is their best album and I got a great deal on the MP3.  Generally I don't like not having a physical CD as a back up, but the price was sooooo good!
B0084U0IEG|4.0|A skillful study of complex attraction and intrigue amidst social and political conditions of post war Britain. Also skillfully, McEwan weaves in a variety of compelling and disturbing fictional stories by a probable literary genius-in-the making into the midst of the spy adventure. The story is told through the interior monologue of protagonist Serena Plume, who at times hems and haws a bit too much. But that's part of the story.
B003L77GRO|1.0|Love Love Love Dexter!  The last disk didn't work but we didn't open it up until it was past the time to get a replacement.  Stupid Amazon!  Still haven't seen the last episode of the fifth season!
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I got this for my son. He is 11 and loved to read it. Its great to be sharing the classics with him, thanks to kindle, I can so that often!
0803738412|5.0|I love this book!  Julia Donaldson is brillant.  She has such a way of telling a story and the illustrations are fantastic. We have a pretty big collection of childrens books but this one is in the to 10.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Vince Flynn's books keep me totally interested and unable to put down.  I compare his fiction with what I read in the newspaper and I see very similar events going on at the same time
B0091REZMW|5.0|This has become my favorite game! Good mental exercise but very hard to put it down!!!! Recommend it to everyone......once you try it....you will play every day ! Enjoy!  :)
B00846REIS|1.0|Sorry to say, but are people actually saying this is better? This? The characters are not well developed and for goodness sakes the author use a lot from fifty shades.I left lost at some parts.I just could pictured what she was saying. No connection.people are saying the second one is a bit better but in not sure I want to waste my money or time :(
B004U8VWLE|5.0|Beautiful dancing, story, and execution. I've ordered copies as Christmas presents for a number of people who have a similar love of the arts and artistic expression.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|This book was just as amazing as I heard it would be. Loved every page and read it all in one afternoon! I bought a copy for everyone I know that has an interest in the afterlife.<br /><br />I'd suggest this book to everyone!
B000N2HBSO|2.0|This is the most detailed book i have ever read.  The minute character descriptions and the shear number of these descriptions pulls the reader off the main theme of the book so often that one tends to become lost.  I pushed thru the entire book, but it was not a rewarding read
B0036TGT3E|5.0|My god this is amazing the blurry is stunning and beautiful and it has everything needed to make this film all the more better
B006LRUVUA|4.0|With my Kindle Fire sometimes I have a black screen that I can't use the mouse in, or a patterned black striped screen that I can semi-see things on my desktop but I can't click anything with. restarting the application works to fix this problem. Full screen things on my home PC like video games don't show up at all sometimes, and watching videos, streams, or games has quite a bit of lag.<br /><br />Overall its the best remote desktop software out there, I think there are a lot of obvious improvements to be made, but that's all work to be done, and problems to be solved by the team viewer people, who are doing a great job!
1451620829|3.0|This book is an entertaining, and I wholey agree honest.  After I read through two thirds of it I might have given it four stars.  It does get a bit detailed in his sex exploits, but hey, it is a rock autobiography.  I also though it questionable that he refers to Gene and Paul as \\"gestapo\\", considering they are Jewish.  He actually refers to Gene as \\"Hitler\\" at one point presumably forgetting that Gene's mom was in a camp.  He does seem to cry more than anyone I know, too.  But the overriding attitute I got sick of is that it is always woe is me, it is everyone else's fault for the bad things that have happened.  Gene is only concerned with money, Paul is cut throat, and Ace is a betrayer (although I am pretty sure what set this off Peter wouldn't even have know about if Ace hadn't felt bad and told him.  Think money issues).  So too many sentences start with \\"I know I was loaded but\\", or \\"I know I did a ton of blow, but\\".  There was one paragraph that ended with \\"that was all his fault\\".  I re-read a couple times to try to figure out how this other person was at fault.  Towards the end, Peter writes something like about an episode \\"I suppose some of this was my fault\\".  By then it is only a coat of paint over a book of finger pointing.  So, in summary, Peter was a founding and intergral member of KISS.  I understand that.  But he \\"rock starred\\" his way to getting fired, including sabotaging concerts by slowing down and speeding up because he felt slighted.  The he had a chance to get his job back, and turned that into a way to get back at Gene and Paul.  He is married to his first wife, and sleeps with every groupie, including his soon to be second wife.  Then has a \\"hole is his heart\\" when that to be ex-wife doesn't pay him enough attention when he is in the hospital.  His current wife is the \\"love of his life\\"  and supports him in his solo career.  Then she gets cancer, and he shows no compassion.  His solo cd tanks, and he blames her, and threatens divorce.  Through it all he has the stupidest judgment in hiring representation, be it mob connected, inexperienced attorneys, attorneys that have no clue on the music business, and he wonders why he had no money, other than he never wrote a check until he was 47.  I understand it could be difficult being a partner with Gene, but Peter is lucky that KISS was still even viable for a reunion tour by 1996.  I would say read the book, but to me, Peter came out fairly unlikeable and need a new mirror to get a good look at himself.
1419705849|1.0|I bought the wimpy kid to my daughter's kindle 6\\" wifi touch. And did not download it, it says can not operate with this kindle. To bad!!!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I personally LOVE this movie, but I know of several people who think it is too sad. It is worth the watch. A fast, easy transaction and at the best price on the web! I would buy from this seller again.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I was excited to read it because of the hype... It was hard to keep reading because I was waiting for something great to happen and nothing other than the expected ever did.  It was repetitive, predictable, and less than expected.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved it!  I will be reading it again and again! :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :)
B00973DDN2|5.0|This is my first music review ever.<br />Not a great Killers fan so far, (I love \\"Human\\") but now I can't stop listening to this album.<br />There is so much debt to some of the songs - and I really enjoy the ballads. Beautiful music, and a great voice!<br /><br />And it is a break from all the same, same on the market.<br /><br />I'm so glad I bought this!
B0083GQ2A0|5.0|Simply Neeson's best performance.  I don't know how he didn't receive an Oscar nomination for this.  Well cast and well directed.  Beautifully made film.
B006O6F932|4.0|you need patience setting it up! After it's setup, it's pretty nice. My 10yr old daughter plays with it everyday.
1612680011|5.0|I have read many books about making money, but this one stands out.  It helped me change the way I think about money.  It also helped me understand about using money to make money.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show! The quality of viewing via Amazon leaves much to be desired, but the show itself is gripping. I thought losing Lori was a mistake, and I am not sure about the two new ex prisoner characters, but on the whole the show has me hooked. I think the writers need to think carefully about who they kill off next, as certain characters are key to the success of the show! I understand that some folks need to die to maintain the integrity of the genre, but character depth is also crucial, otherwise this becomes just another gory zombie movie and will not keep my interest.
B00846REIS|5.0|I enjoyed the book so much that after borrowing it from a coworker I bought it for myself to read again.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|AMC has totally outdone themselves and everyone else with this show. HBO is probably sorry they didn't think of it first!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I couldn't put it down. I am now REALLY looking forward to Entwined in You. I was hoping for an early release, and I am sad it has been pushed forward :(<br />Other than that, I am in love with the Crossfire series. Way to go Sylvia Day!!!
B0054N73EY|5.0|If you love the Red Hot Chili Peppers you are going to love this album. I rather buy an album of a band that Im fan of than download the cd.
B004GYNPL2|5.0|I haven't paid $10 for very many apps, but I was switching from an iPhone 3GS to a Samsung Galaxy S III, and I had come to rely on mSecure to keep track of all of my logins, codes, and such.  I hated the thought of learning a new app, but I still decided to shop around first ... didn't find anything that made it worth the risk ... so I paid my money (again, although I understand that it's a different platform), downloaded mBackup for my PC, backed up my 3GS to the PC, and restored my S III from that backup ... worked like a charm.  (note: that's just one of several ways to get your data over to the new phone)<br /><br />The app runs very similarly to the iOS app ... thus far I've noticed only a couple of minor irritants (not worth dinging it a full star) ... for example, when logging in, you can't just hit the Next key after typing the password, you have to touch the icon up on the screen ... not a big deal, just a little slower ... and the iOS version had the alphabet list running down the right side that allowed you to jump down to the general portion of the list that you wanted with one touch ... the Android version doesn't have that, so you either have to use the search function or scroll down ... again, not a huge problem, but it takes longer.  There are other tools for organizing the list, which I'll have to explore and start using instead, I guess.<br /><br />For those of you who don't have a password manager app, and who have many different types of data to manage (web logins, frequent flyer accounts, network passwords, etc., this would be a good choice because it's very flexible in the types of records that you can store.  In short, it's worth the money, even for a cheapskate like me.
0553212419|5.0|Item as good as described, almost new! Great packaging and protection. And sherlock holmes you know is a very good novel.
B009GXHOW4|2.0|It would be cool if I could fiqure out how to get the stuff to stay in my inventory... if anybody knows how please help me!!! please
B004WKOCP8|5.0|If you love Incubus, this is a great album. The quality of the item not as good as i expected but is great!
B009NQKPUW|3.0|&#34;Almost&#34; is the word  would use to describe this move.  It almost tells a story; it &#34;almost&#34; ties the &#34;Alien&#34; series to its beginnings; the special effects &#34;almost&#34; save the movie;  the acting is &#34;almost&#34; good (expected more than &#34;gee whiz&#34; from Noomi Rapace after &#34;The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo&#34; films.  Although, I thought her self-aborted late term Alien scene was the movies saving moment.  (Who knew self-abortion was the easiest way to get rid of an unwanted alien.  Think of all the exploding chests we could have saved in the other movies.  This scene &#34;Almost&#34; saves the movie.  Anyway, as franchises go I watched it.  I wonder what happens in the next one?  Do the big guys with whom we share DNA help us finally figure out how to kill the Alien they left behind?  Or are they just as scared of them as we are?  I bet they're scared.  If they weren't why make another movie?
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This is definately one of the best Christmas movies ever made. All ages and genders can enjoy! Chevy Chase and Beverly DeAngelo made another great Vacation movie!!
B00AA7O22U|2.0|Same corny dialog and over-the-top shoot-em-up.  Not that anyone should expect differently in a movie like this, but it was supposed to be an improvement over the first.  I didn't expect much more, and in that, it didn't disappoint.
B004LWZW8I|3.0|The description said \\"like new\\"<br />The case was broken so when shipped the dvd slid around within the case and got scratched to heck. -Still playable, but expected better.
B003B02PFO|4.0|This is a fun and easy read with a good message. I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it for others.
B00632HWOG|4.0|Easy install and use.<br />I can access my email much easier and it displays on my kindle just fine. Good app.
1400069289|5.0|Very good practical knowledge: establish a good habit, change a bad habit, increase willpower. Real tools you can put to use.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|This is an excellent Christmas CD.  The songs are mostly tradtional versions of Christmas favorites.  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys holiday music.  Great buy!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I am now hooked cant wait for season 3 if you like love, lust, evil and suspense then this is it
B0063IH60K|5.0|love it! app works well. no issues so far. love the feature of playing against another person. online recommend everyone. to download
0385474547|1.0|Worst book I've ever read.  Try Green Eggs & Ham, Cat in the Hat, The Lorax, or anything else worth reading.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Theodor Seuss Geisel
B0014I4KH6|5.0|anyone who keeps singing taylor's recent releases, will love this cd...her beginning!<br />so young and so talented and her whole life and many boyfriends to fuel her songwriting career ahead of her!
B002ZG999U|5.0|Very entertaining movie to see at home with all the great super stars, amazing heavy auctions on foreign land, I like it.
B002RT2BXQ|5.0|I have always been interested in how converted socalists viewed capitalists.  Any Rand in her book, &#34;The Fountainhead&#34; leaves no doubt that she believes an individual has a copyright to, not only their inventons, but to their ideas, individuality of thoughts, and philisophies.  I agree with her and everything said by the architect in the courtroom scene where he defends himself.  I think Gary Cooper was a fine actor for his day but Fountaine leaves me cold.
B003UYV08E|5.0|Very entertaining movie to watch, compared with the 1st Iron Man are better auctions and graphics, it is good, I like it.
B000T412OU|5.0|love this movie and felt it was one of Harrison Fords best, although it would not have been without Gary Oldmans superbe antignistic role of the bad guy.  Oldman is a surperb actor in every role I have seen him play.  :Love any movie that has a patriotic theme and &#34;Air Force One&#34; fits that description
B001C08RHA|5.0|Very good, I was impressed  by the diversity of multiple auctions in this movie of a man captured by an enemy, I like it.
B0000DIXDR|5.0|&#34;Dirty Dancing&#34; at the time changed the direction of dance in this country.  Swayse and Grey did a very good job of a tough, loose guy while Grey turns him around.  So, so love story but loved the dancing and music of that time.  Side-line, my daughter almost got thrown out of her senior prom for trying dirty dancing with her partner.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|One of a kind movie, to enjoy watching it you must have an excellent audio system with deep base and a large screen TV Set.<br />I like it very much.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Great movie for all ages. The 3d version is awesome. We loved the special effects and the characters. Well worth the money spent to add to any movie collection.
B001BZ6RDC|5.0|I purchased this book for my daughter for Christmas, she is a fan of this novella.  This beautiful collector's edition with it's lovely leather binding and gold gilded pages will be the beginning of her home library.  I am very pleased with this elegantly bound book and plan to purchase more of the same.
075669812X|5.0|Great price and includes the hard to find Green Ninja, Lloyd, and has all the information my boys love about Ninjago, which I find hard to follow compared to other Lego series.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Can't get enough of this site, great ideas for everything in life. Wish I had been the one who thought of it.
B000SXMSJ0|5.0|Jones is superb, a great CD for most any occasion. Her singing, playing, and writing are outstanding and stick with you.
B007TXN4TK|3.0|I loved the app to start with but then have had problems off and on with the sound. It's fun when the sound works.
B009JZVT70|5.0|This show is perfectly cast and wonderfully done. My wife and I discovered it on Netlix, watched the whole first season, then had to move on to amazon dot com to get up to date. I hope this series runs for years as the characters, writing, and actors are superb.
B007Z8ZKS2|5.0|Fantastic characters, electric dialogue, reread it from the start a week after initial reading because I loved keeping the company of characters so much.<br /><br />Recommended for readers of all ages - don't be put off by the young adult tag or you will miss out.
B00A3AUGEW|4.0|I've had a chance to listen to this CD about 20 times now. There are songs where he really gets magic going, maybe 4 or 5. The other songs, however, just don't do it for me. I think that this man is going to get better and better. He has smooth and sweet vocals and some great writing, too.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Best movie of the trilogy. A great ending to the Batman series and a great movie to watch with the family
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|This book was recommended and I am very satisfied with it.  The shipment was received very promptly and in good shape.
B002VECM6S|5.0|Very heart warming! Southern hospitality at it's best! Great performance by all the actors. I just had to buy it to watch it again!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|great a a a a a a a a a a a s x d c v  c c cx
B007HACDLK|4.0|This episode examines the extremes of manipulation and the realities of switching sides. Villains who don't react as villains, old friends with warped agendas coupled with good guys with bad information make for treacherous footing for Rapp and his boss.  A good read.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|This movie is flawed story wise, but this Blu-ray is fantastic! This version is Filled with TONS of extras, all excellent. This Blu-ray actually made me like the movie a lot more! Highly recommended!
B004GVUPFE|5.0|My husband, six year old son and I took turns on this game and had to work together on a couple of them. This is great fun for children as well as adults. Great mind exercise and good for young kids with the application of mathematics. Addictive once you get going!
B004I2K4E8|1.0|This show has NOTHING to do with the 10th Anniversary one. The 10th is absolutely awesome, with much better singers. Especially Marius. Whose idea was it to cast Jonas as that important character? He is a joke. He has the voice (if you can call that a voice) to sing light pop songs, NOT for an opera ike this one. If you want a truly beautiful rendition, get the 10th Anniversary. It was a gorgeous show.
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|Sanderson created this fasinating alternate universe without tiresome exposition and he has given me something to think about. The story is told in an easy style that makes profound ideas about our most essential selves accessable. I'm going to look up his other titles and see what else I've missed.
B003K07DUC|4.0|This movie doesn't require the viewers undivided attention and there is nothing really unexpected. Its a conspiracy movie about a rotten egg in the government and Matt Damon is of course the good guy. Chase scenes (on foot and in vehicles), some action, some suspense. A pretty good movie if you like this sort of thing (and I do). Some torture scenes if you are the queasy type but nothing like The Good Shepard; fairly brief and not too graphic. If you like Matt Damon, you will like this movie.
B004T5K3OK|1.0|I LIKED the free version, no problems. But after I purchased the licensed version I can no longer find WHERE the documents go after scanning.
B007712XAU|5.0|This is a series that can be watched multiple times to discover details previously missed.  Now to schedule a downtown Abbey marathon when the final season begins.
B006ZAZ31U|4.0|Fearless is an incredible story and very entertaining for a biography.  Any previous knowledge to the book doesn't spoil a thing.  Blehm does an amazing job with the facts and yields an incredible story of a man that was truly fearless.
B005V4FJC4|5.0|Perfect background music to get/keep you in the holiday spirit. Chill, wonderful vocals. A hip Christmas album that you won't get tired of listening to.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I am so hooked on the show now. I missed the first two seasons.  Great way to catch up and find out how the show began..
B002M7A79S|5.0|Great film, esp. if you are a fan of the show Firefly. It basically wraps the show up and is very well done.
B00AE2J93I|2.0|Boring with a wired ending even for a animated movie. This is not a movie for young children. Just bad
B004H1V5RU|4.0|Although it is for one of my grandchildren, I had a go playing it and enjoyed the challenge. I didn't get very far when the ball fell, but I certainly became hooked on it and finished one challenge.
0452295548|5.0|This book is a must read for family and friends of stroke patients and I might add must read for all caretakers.
B002BWP49C|5.0|I've never read the books so I wasn't a big fan going into Twilight but the movie did a great job of engaging you and anxious to see Part 2. Great bonus features too on the making of the movie. I would recommend buying it.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|My 23 month old loves these puzzle games!!  There is an animal version by this publisher that is her favorite.  Got it free and has seen a lot of use!
B001UV4XFG|5.0|Very well done with them coming together to fight Victoria and the newborns. I really liked how the fight scenes where coordinated. Great behind the scenes footage on the making of the movie also.
B008NMT684|5.0|Great for toddlers starting out on the Kindle.  The trucks are cute and when they finish a puzzle balloons float up the screen that they can pop.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Another wonderful movie from the Kendrick brothers! Well put together and spiritually moving film for the whole family. I would highly recommend seeing it and buying the movie. You won't regret it!!
0679882820|4.0|My toddler LOVES this book...she always says &#34;where Mr Brown go?&#34;.  However, this board book is a shorter version than the full book.  For younger kids that's good for their attention span, but there are a lot more rhymes in the full book.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Good improvements on these movies. The clarity increases with each movie. The original to me was fair, but well worth the money.
B0042RJWTC|1.0|Im not dissing the series bec. the series was very good. This review is on the packaging and the discs. When I receives the dvd's, most of the discs were scratched, the album packaging it came in was torn and the disc's were coming out of the slots from the bottom. It looked second hand and was just shrink wrapped to look new. I played a few disc and there were episodes that skip and freeze on certain parts. Returned it for a replacement since I payed for a new item, not some ripped up second hand stuff. I think HBO should stop marketing their products in album-like slot cardboard packaging. It scratches up the discs and it wears out the cardboard overtime from use. Will see how the replacement looks like. 2 stars for attrocious packaging and discs.<br /><br />Update: 2 stars to 1<br /><br />The replacement sent has less scratches, but still some series skips and freezes. I cannot believe this is the quality of product we are receiving from the makers of this series.  Very POOR QUALITY! I guess i have to watch the sex and the city series that I also ordered, since its also by hbo. Big disappointment. Love the series though.
1449433251|5.0|Bought for my brother for Christmas as we loved Calvin and Hobbes growing up. Great books! Nice that you can get them all in one go (though I didn't love that the price is printed irremoveably on the box :P
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I watched this is Vegas and fell in love with the music. Saw the dvd and just bought it on impulse. No complaints... The music and singing and acting are superb. All characters were amazing!
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|It's not so good movie, less than I expected. I already read the book, but the movie didn't show what I wanted.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|It would have more stars, though transfering files on bluetooth sometimes isn't as smooth as it could be. The free version works pretty good though.
B002WV5A9G|3.0|I've even heard Abramb is a fan moor of Star Wars (which are great movies of the genera, even if I am a Treky).  And that's what this phone felt like, more like a Star Wars than a Star Trek.  After all that's why like Star Wars last Star Trek more cold Star Wars is more fantastical, and Star Trek is more SCIENCE fiction.  Bt the biggest problem is why the origional pilot never made it on the air: the bigwigs thougth the nacent Star Trek too cerebrial for it apparently dumb viewers.  And what Abrams did is much moor that meaningless gun-and-run melodrama of modern Hollywood that is cetainly anti-cerebral.  What was the point of the film?  In II-IV, the pooints were clear: defeat man with a vendetta, save Spock, get back home (and save the Earth on the side).  The point of this film--man with a vendetta--could have been nicely written into a 45-minute episode. So it was a poor herald of &#34;Star Trek.&#34; Moorover, the charecters, in keeping with the theme, are poor, melodramatic, imitation recreations of the classic originals.  Nothig about this accuretly recaptures thr spitit of the Original Series.<br /><br />But it wasn't an all-bad SciFi.  If it haven't had the name quotes star track, quote I probably would not have gone to see it; but if I happened to catch it on television or something I might have enjoyed it.  It could have been an afable B-class flick; if it just weren't called a&#34;Star Trek.&#34;<br /><br />It is NOTHING like TOS!  On that front, it is a major disappointment.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Product quality is good .. is according to the price paid .. recommend this product is just what I needed..all ok
B002YIHO7I|5.0|Sade did it again with this one.  She and her band are masters so there's not much other than excellence to expect of them and that's what they deliver consistently.  It's soulful, jazzy and classed up urban.
B006FYGF8Q|5.0|Product quality is good .. is according to the price paid .. recommend this product is just what I needed
B00138KEZ4|4.0|Wintersong is a really good alternative arrangement of some traditional songs. McLachlan does not disappoint. I would recommend it for the Alternative Music crowd.
0374275637|5.0|Not exactly a page turner but I usually digested one chapter at a time. But it is very thought provoking. It has really altered the way I think.
B00785P2QC|3.0|this game makes you buy credits if u don't have any Andes u have to buy stuff like energy but besides that the game is fun!!! I lug it but I'm only ten so....yeah
1451648537|5.0|This book was something that I was meant to read at this stage in my life.  I picked it up a few months ago but only got through the first 10 pages and lost interest.  When I started it again just a couple of weeks ago, I was hooked - absolutely hooked - until the very end.  The book was more to me than just an interesting story about a man's life.  It went further than that.  This book was written in such a way that I could get lost in the man who was Steve Jobs and think about life on a grander scale.  I saw the limits that we humans put on ourselves and how Steve Jobs was able to live in a truly limitless world.  I realize that he had flaws like anyone else, but the author really captivated the entirety of his character in such a way that we (I) could forgive him those flaws.<br /><br />This book for me was somewhat life-changing.  I may sound dramatic, but this book opened my eyes to the nature of a man who literally changed the world.  It may not be the change that everyone thinks is the \\"right\\" change.  Regardless, he did revolutionize the way things were done.  The fact that the author could capture the essence of this man so that the reader could truly understand him is a miracle.  I kept thinking to myself, \\"Wow, if I could have only read this when Steve Jobs was alive!  I would have wanted to meet him in person.\\"  And I would have, too, because I realize that Jobs is one of the few people in this world who, when he put his mind to something that was seemingly impossible, he not only made it possible but he made others believe that it's possible!  I learned from this!  We all should!<br /><br />Anyone who is interested in business or just bettering their lives and getting out of their own way should read this book.  I kept thinking about situations where I really thought something was too difficult to accomplish or \\"impossible\\" to achieve.  I will let go of that belief.  Even though Jobs didn't conquer the cancer with that mindset like he hoped (I have my own opinion about that), he seemed to in every other aspect of his professional life.<br /><br />Great and amazing book!  So much more than I could have hoped!
B0058W74UY|2.0|Uninstalled, it would not play the Flash files I was hoping to use it for. also was trying to use it to play the Flash movies from the CW TV app. would not work...
B000UZNRS2|4.0|This book was fast paced and hard to put down.  Although it started out with several stories going on at the same time Baldacci pulled everything together masterfully.  If you like spy thrillers (with some organized crime mixed into the action), you will like this book.  Baldacci does not put you to sleep with endless and superfluous description.  His chapters are short and are like scene changes in a movie.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|I really enjoyed watching this movie.  If you like syfy this is your type of movie it is very well done.
B004SDEP38|5.0|I have been using this product for some years now, particularly while in school.  It made life very easy for me transporting class work back and forth to class. Perfect for my workplace too!  A must have Item!
B008KE3960|4.0|I have always been a fan of Tower Defense games, and like airplane landing games, but this is a great blend of both. Great graphics and game play make this a fun game.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|This movie was good he is turning out to be a good actor. The story line was good and didnt have any bad drifting away from it
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Even for older adults an enjoyable, entertaining movie. Even without having read the widely popular books. Our teenagers are certainly hooked.
B008R14YBK|5.0|Teddy or not, sorry, Ready or not, Blond, Gold all sticking in my head<br />certainly an entertainment bargain! [Didn't have to ask Midas for a loan<br />before deciding to buy it!] Well done Ms. Mendler! \\"Good luck...\\" on your<br />next album! -also- Wondering if she'll be making an appearance in \\"Alex vs Alex\\"?
B007SSEBCU|4.0|Margaret Thatcher was certainly a remarkable woman. I did not know to what extend her upbringing and her series of firsts (elected in the house of commons, first female prime minister) influenced her. The movie gives a strong hint at her exposure to sexism in a world mostly inhabited by men as part of her iron will. Well acted by Meryl Streep but at times bit slow.
B00AGE20ZI|5.0|A wonderful Christmas movie.  Well written, acted and filmed.  You have to watch a couple of times to catch all of the good stuff.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|My kids love this!  They can play it for hours and they get excited when they get a new &#34;sticker&#34; .  My three year old can play this with no problems!!!
B009RI4ZKC|4.0|Moonrise Kingdom was very well done, and good for a couple of hours of escape from the real world. I think many viewers will see a bit of themselves in one or more of the main youth characters. Enjoy!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Such a great story. couldn't put it down!! highly reccomend it! Cant wait for the next on to come out
B0085RQLXK|5.0|Great CD! It came quick. It was a great price! Enjoying every song. I was nice to have it in my mailbox the day it was released.
B0002TJGQS|2.0|Some of the batteries just don't seem to fully work. The items that i placed them in seemed to have drained them rather quickly, they show to be the proper voltage etc. they just died quickly.
B009NPKTN6|3.0|1st time I tried to watch it it kept pausing, then frozen. I tried 2x to watch it that day. Next day had no problems. Worked fine.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|I loved it, very entertaining and very good quality on streaming. I will definitely be renting more videos through amazon
0738711500|5.0|I found this book enlightening and very supportive of someone just starting out learning to read tarot cards.  I was especially pleased with the deck included with the purchase.  It was well worth the price paid and I can't praise it enough.  If you're looking for your first introduction to tarot, look no further.  Praise and cheers for Josephine Ellershaw's Easy Tarot!
B00881PPTO|4.0|One of the best multiple site travel software out there. A definite must have for those who do any travel.
B000MD7OKY|5.0|What more can I say Alfred Hitchcock and Grace Kelly! I was deighted to find this on DVD for my collection!
B0000X61VE|3.0|not as great as I remember this workout to be....but i still enjoy working out to it....and Cindy still inspires me
B003UESJ9M|3.0|This movie was fair. It held my attention and I will probably watch it again. My big problem with this movie is the ending. Without spoiling it for others...I just don't understand why you would title a movie as such when there is nothing 'strong' about the ending.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|My family enjoyed this movie much more than other critically acclaimed films...entertaining and unique...a must have addition to every film library
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am going to get the rest of this collection...fun fast reading...I have recommended this to many of my friends.
0345803493|5.0|Unique story that has you entralled from the get go...excellent gift for any woman...now being made into a major motion picture
B00992CF6W|4.0|graphics are not great and there's no lava or monsters like the real one your apple products are better for this game
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Kind of predictable. moves right along and well-written, but not his best work.  Glad he's back to regular stoyr line though.
B000ZECQ08|5.0|I forgot that I had bought the single DVD.  The appeal of this are the extra features on the second disc.  For Harry Potter fans the discount price is worth it.
B007ED9FIY|3.0|A slow starter but gets better. It's worth watching but I would suggest spending less money and waiting until you can rent it.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I love this game! I was at level 46 when my daughter reset my Kindle Fire. so, now ive has to start all over. I gave it four stars because it forced closed a bunch..very annoying.
B004VMUS9G|3.0|good app. i use it on my kindle fire and it works okay.  i cant get it to work with my radio app so i loaded some music for it to use for wakeups.  when i set my kindle fire it goes to sleep but it wakes up and plays my music ... its loud enuf for me.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This alarm clock is so easy to set and has a wide variety of alarms to wake up to.  It also letts you set and save your settings.  After you have it set you can have the alarn go off everyday, weekdays, or just once.  So much easier than a regular alarm clock and I always have my kindle close.
B005IQZB14|3.0|It seemed to me to be irresponsible to have gone out on that hike without any experience at all.  She's lucky she made it....BUT then again, I guess it made her a better person??<br /><br />I read it because of a book club I belong to. Most of whom wouldn't put it at the top of their list~!
B00352QISI|4.0|This movie sort of has the same feel as Event Horizon.  Crazy story and and even crazier ending.  If you like horror drama then you'll probably like this.  I had to watch this a few times to really get what was going on.  Overall I like it and would suggest watching, if your a Dennis Quaid fan.
0240810961|5.0|Learn form the brilliant disney animators how to draw. It's a big book and doesn't have as many draws as you might think but the information is priceless.
B00338QENI|5.0|This was my first purchase for my new Kindle.  I zipped through it faster than I would have with the paperback.  I enjoyed the involvement of the author in the story, because she was part of it.  I know there were ill-intentioned people involved with tissue acquisition and experimentation.  However, I wish to believe that most doctors and professionals ultimately are trying to serve the well-being of their fellow man.  Rebecca dedicated so much time gathering information about the facts and emotions involved with this story.  It was well done.  A real eye-opener.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|I ENJOYED THIS MOVIE IMMENSELY HOWEVER, I LIKE VIOLENT MOVIES WITH A MORAL THEME.  THIS IS PROBABLY NOT MOVIE FOR THE SQUEAMISH OR CHILDREN.  I ENJOY THE PATRIOTIC THEME  PART OF THE PLOT OF CIA TRAINED OPERATIVE RESCUING  HIS DAUGHTER FROM SLAVE TRADING THUGS.  THE MOVIE IS FAST PACED  FROM THE VERY BEGINNING AND HAS THE FAIRY TALE ENDING THAT WE ALL ENJOY.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This game is not just about quick reactions and dumb luck.  You actually have to think to solve mysteries that will get you ahead in the game.  I have not played it myself, but I love watching my 8 year old daughter playing and solving all sorts of mysteries!  You actually need a brain to play this game.

B006ON41FC|4.0|My kids love to play this game. It is probably good for the age range of five to nine year olds.
B0063IH60K|1.0|I only gave it one star because It's not that I hate it, I don't have it.  Where is it?
B002SQNM9A|3.0|Love Taylor Swift but I would have liked a few more songs on this Christmas album.  The album is too short.
B0017P520U|4.0|THE ANIMATIONS WERE SO REALISTIC, AND MADE FOR MORE POWERFUL EFFECTS AND AMAZING ACTION!  THIS IS THE BEST VERSION YET.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Life of Pi was an entertaing and provacative read. I enjoyed the insights about animals. The one negative for me was the &#34;carnivorous&#34; island. That challenged my &#34;suspension of disbelief&#34;.
B007HACDLK|3.0|As someone who has read every one of Vince Flynn's &#34;Mitch Rapp&#34; novels, I happen to think that his books are some of the best bit of entertainment out there. There's a reason why I buy them as early as they become available, because they're high quality page turners. With that said, Flynn spins another bit of yarn here to keep the Rapp fantasy going. But this shtick is getting old. I'm a fan, so I can understand how other fans might not like to hear this, but I can't be the only person that is tired of the &#34;I'm the baddest dude in the world&#34; storyline for 400 pages again. There has to be some kind of challenge to that persona within the context of Rapp's story in a way that advances him for long-standing readers of the series. I know it has worked for the previous 13 books, and maybe I was being too optimistic after the last tome, but I couldn't help but feel Flynn had to go in another direction here if he wanted to improve upon the character. That's simply not the case. Instead, we get another quality tale of Rapp and his exploits that will surely entertain for the time being, but there's nothing refreshing here and nothing that makes this long-time reader want to stick around and wait for that next stage of the assassin's career. I'm more inclined to believe that Flynn is going to milk this character as long as he can instead of thinking of something else to do creatively. Needless to say, he's obviously a talented writer and I think a new direction would help for fans of his fiction and his own work.
B004VYYA2K|5.0|I bought this for my daughter's Barbie collection and it holds a lot of Barbies, as well as a number of accessories.  It makes carrying them from room to room a lot easier.  I highly recommend this product.
B002VHI8J0|5.0|It's all been said before, and it's all justified - this is an amazing accomplishment and a thoroughly enjoyable read. Some readers find the jumping back and forth between styles and stories distracting and show off - y, but once you get used to it it works very well, a coherent kaleidoscope of impressions, images and story lines that constitute a grand literary feast.<br />I absolutely loved it and am curious to see if and how the film works.<br /><br />Please keep them coming Mr Mitchell - you're restoring this reader's faith in contemporary literature.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|The video quality was excellent and the movie was visually stunning and the story was very compelling.  definitely recommend it
B007BVMVDU|5.0|This series is very well done and the story line stays very true to the book series.  This was an especially great episode.

0307352145|2.0|As a weak introvert myself, and a frequent reader of books in this genre I was rather excited about this book.  It starts out with some information about how extroverts became the desired personality types in the US and to a lesser degree in other parts of the world as well.  It then goes on to talk about the \\"power\\" of introverts, some of the unique values that they offer, and how they too can contribute to society.  Unfortunately it just keeps on talking about this same subject, on and on and on, well after the point is made.  To be honest I don't know if it ever offers any useful advice because I couldn't make myself read any further.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|A combination of puzzle and skill, build it, test it, and run it. It's a lot of fun. Many hours of enjoyment.

B007L3BMGA|2.0|Haven't got past the first page. Which I found boring, Will need some enthusiasm to keep reading. Hope it gets better/
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It was a little slower then the last couple Batman's but the story line was very interesting. It had some crazy twists and some good fight scenes. This rental will definitely not dissapoint.
0321399536|4.0|The delivery of the book was exceptional, but the quality of the book was kind of disappointing. However, it is the material that I was looking forward to, not the image of the book.
B005LAIHSQ|4.0|This movie was pretty good, carried solely on the performances of Hemsworth and Theron. For a costume buff like myself, this movie was simply outstanding. The dresses (one made up of thousands of beetle wings) make this movie a visual stunner--making up for its lackluster plot.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Rodriguez first album is a very good album, but his second, Coming From Reality, is simply a masterpiece.  The lyrics are incredible and some of the tracks are filled with outstanding music, such as the fine guitar work on Climb Up on my music and the fiddle on the beautiful lullaby written for his daughters Sandra and Eva in the Sandreven Lullaby.  There is an edition of this album with 3 bonus tracks.  I recommend getting that version.  There are 2 unrecorded tracks possibly from a never published third album and a single, Can't Get Away, released, I believe in 1967.  If you are interested in well written lyrics then Climb on this album.  You will not be disappointed.
0394818237|5.0|Classic book, kids can learn a lot from it. I first saw it from my friend's house, she borrowed from library. I would recommend to my other friends.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I really enjoyed this book,  Recommended to a friend who greatly enjoyed it as well. Can't wait for the next one.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks does it again!<br />Romance, mystery and action all rolled into one.<br />A must read for anyone!<br />Grat gift to give!
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Its a time burner for sure. Its one of those games you can play while waiting at the doctor's or someplace. Or if your tensed up for some reason playing this game will relax you through boredom. But hey&hellip;its a free app so have fun.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Amazing book.  Saw the movie also.  Both were very well done.  I've been recommending this to all my family & friends.
B0010T0OCY|5.0|The Matrix ripped this movie off, but this movie has much more style and heart. If you like NOIR style, then this is for you.
B000FC1LOC|5.0|In my life I have read many books that have got me  a little teary; but, never in my life have I read a book that send me to straight out crying until I read the sisters keeper.
0553108034|5.0|This is going to be the best gift my fiance gets all Christmas season! The books are slightly expensive ($20 for one hardback and I bought 4 of them so it was roughly $80) but they are worth it!!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Super cute and super fun! I got tired of Fantasy Town or whatever it was called because I didn't care about anyone in my town and there wasn't much to do besides collect taxes, but this one has ponies!! AND it's got fun mini games that you can play really often. What more can I ask for?
B00899F0G8|5.0|Was so angry when I found out that ABC Family had removed the full episode of the Halloween from their website; however, Amazon has once again saved me from having to wait to watch the episode.  Great quality and was able to stream through the PS3 to my TV.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I gave this 5 stars because its exactly what I wanted. I wanted to be a better cook and I wanted to learn. If you don't want to learn I would still get the book and just skip what I think is the best part. You will still learn some how to prepare some great meals. Its 5$ on kindle. Why would you not...
B000PMLFRA|5.0|This was a gift for my fiance! He absolutely loved it.  I had never seen the Star Wars movies before so it was a gift to myself as well.  I truly enjoyed the series!
B00A8ECU24|1.0|After downloading, I tested the app to see how it worked.  I had downloaded it for my 3 year old daughter.  Either the other folks who love this app are computer geniuses or I'm just out of my element.  I couldn't get past the first stage by myself.  Unloaded it after several ill-fated attempts to place the mill.
B003E48AYC|5.0|Love this set! The quality it good and the packaging is great! This movie is amazing and Johnny Depp outdoes himself in the role of The Mad Hatter!
0385536828|4.0|I think it's interesting that many of the people contributing reviews for Sweet Tooth state that the narrator is Serena. Without giving anything away, I'd like to say that I think that most clearly is not the case. An engaging, thoroughly satisfying book that demonstrates again how bright, inventive and interesting McEwan is. I won't say it exists at the same high altitude as Atonement, but it comes pretty close.
B007SGM084|5.0|This was an enjoyable book to read.  It is a pretty simple story but it is told in a way that you get to know the characters and it turns into a love story.
B009FZFONO|5.0|The quality of the stream is phenomenal. The series has me at the edge of my seat every week. I love this show!
B005LAIH2W|5.0|Never knew these stories existed until I saw the movie.  I have read 3 of the books.  They are kind of predictable after awhile but still a fun swashbuckling ride.  Too bad the movie didn't do better at the box office but that is Disney's fault.  It is fun for it's different approach and when you consider it was written over a 100 years ago, you will have more appreciation for the movie.  I wish there would be another one in the tradition of the books but given the poor sales (again, Disney's fault) I doubt there will be another.  The books are a free download on the apps for iPhone.  Enjoy!
0316069434|4.0|It was slow getting into it but tough to put down once Connelly slipped into third gear. He doesn't overwhelm you with too many characters and the small amount of filler showed Harry Bosch's family side. A believable plot well woven.
159562015X|5.0|I teach graduate courses for Marriage Family Therapists and in the basic counseling skills course this is used for students to discover insights into their strengths.  I took the test too and found it very helpful.  I bought the book for my daughter and she is using the feedback to prepare for an interview at her work.
1451695195|5.0|I have read NDE stories (near death experience) and have one friend who shared her near death experience with me. I have never doubted these events. I know that many people do. If you have doubts I just finished reading the book: Proof of Heaven by Eben Alexander 111, MD<br /><br />What is so strikingly different about this story is Eben's background. He is a neurosurgeon-a student and master of science. He has no overt religious affiliation and by his own admission politely listened and ignored the NDE stories of his patients.<br /><br />In summary he has the credentials. Now add to it the event that triggered the book. He contracted a disease that is nearly unheard of in adults. He was not in any situation that would have exposed him and as a result his body rapidly deteriorated so that by day 3 of entering a coma there was nearly no chance of him returning to a normal life and by day 5 he the likelihood of him dying was north of 97%. One more important thing, during the time he was in a coma his brain was monitored and it was recording nothing--nothing.<br /><br />On Day 6, not only did he wake up but he was coherent--he looked at the people in the room and said: \\"what are you doing here?\\" Within 2 months he was fully recovered and returned to his medical practice.<br /><br />What happened during the 6 days he was in a coma is a spell bounding story. I already had business commitments or I would have never put this book down. Of course I am not going to tell you that story. Eben does that. But I will tell you this, if you doubted the human potential that is written about on this blog and in many other resources and have doubted the definition of God being Unconditional Love this book is likely to erase all doubts.
B0053O89YM|5.0|Terrific show - great cast.  Always look forward to new episodes coming on CBS each week.  was interested to see how the Will storyline would play out
B000IJ79UW|5.0|If you enjoy Superman, definitely purchase this set as it is the ultimate product! Christopher Reeve exercised with weights and built himself up into this role...no padding was used. That, as well as great special effects, including the superb flying sequences, and a story line that pitted Superman versus his arch-enemy Lex Luthor, make this set a must buy!
B006YXTRHY|4.0|Did a good job with dividing the book into 2 movies and taking the key pieces. One of the better movies in the series
B003YCI1O8|5.0|Picture quality was much better than expected. I was only looking for the DVD but I got the blu-ray as it was the cheaper option. Turned out to have great sound and picture quality. This movie was just as I remembered, scary when I was younger and hillarious now. Overall good quirky movie from the 90s.
1451695195|3.0|The author spends a lot of time telling us about his family.  Some of this is pertinent to his other-worldly experience, but I believe some of it also served as a &#34;filler&#34; to expand his story.  I came away a tad disappointed that he did not or could not reveal some of the answers provided him during his time in &#34;heaven.&#34;  I had watched interviews of him, previous to buying his book, and was excited to learn more.  Perhaps my expectations were too high.
B0065CCM76|5.0|Loved it since I was a kid.  I remember hearing on my parents all 8 track home stereo system.  Had to have it on my mp3.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Thought it outstanding the first time I saw it in theater, but watching it the second time began to recognize even more its significance and brilliance. The story, the directing, the cinematography, the characters, the soundtrack, the acting, all are outstanding.<br /><br />I wish every American could see this. Although not all might recognize the social-cultural-political significance of the film. I dare not elaborate lest too many be offended. Let me risk saying just this, that the film illustrates where the United States is going, where it might end up, and what *serious* people must do in order to restore our nation and its culture to something that is sane and more in line with reality.<br /><br />Hint = that Gotham City is *isolated* from rest of the world and must for the most part save itself is extremely important.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Enthralling rollercoaster. Frustrating, just like a marriage. Flynn does an amazing job at manipulating your feelings as if you were experiencing the story firsthand.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|My daughter and I knew next to nothing about Tinker Bell or fairies when we saw this film. It has so many wonderful elements - sacrifice, adventuring into mysterious lands, how every fairy has their talent (and job), respect for nature's balance...Now we are both in love with fairies and their woods! Don't need to be a Mouse lover for this one. Highly recommend it for you and your littles.
B0094OLJD0|4.0|Not bad, bought mainly for David Byrne, will admit I love his previous work with Talking heads better. Overall though, a good buy.
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|Arrived in time for it to be viewed in order. Now have completed my entire series. This is exactly what I expected. I would recommend this to everyone who loves Gilmore Girls.
B003SI5NX0|4.0|Not so HD, even though its an old movie, but still. Although it was still pretty damn good for it.
B009GESJH2|5.0|I  never read other reviews about Kid Rocks music or his concerts...everyone has different opinions and taste in music even when we agree to like the same artist or a record they put out, we all listen to it differently. I have every record he has done and I have seen him ...gosh so many times...I will say that I like his music because  when I listen to it it feels real...I get it. Now that doesnt mean that I like every song with a passion...I have come to know what I expect from his music. I will always be a fan, his music touches me, I relate to it. This is a good CD..I have it in my truck and it will be one of those &#34;go to&#34; CDs. We all have one...the music that makes us happy,helps us get thru a hard day, or just something to help us clear our head. I have a few go tos...2 of them are Kid Rock....this new one makes 3. I would definitely buy it again.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Mesmerizing. It's so hard to put down. An incredible read and series. Makes me extremely anxious for the movies! Love it
B002EBDP9G|3.0|An intelligent and well written book that helped me to understand the rationale behind much of the right wing rhetoric that I usually find so mystifying.  However, his arguments may only ring true to those who agreed with him before picking up his book.  Perhaps that is a universal truth about such books; we all see the world from different angles in different lights.<br /><br />I am still idealistic enough to hope for a history that presents both sides fairly but know that the objectivity of the writer and the reader are always lost as the information sifts through our cultural filters and is sorted according to our personal system of values.  But, as this history reaches the twentieth century this book starts to feel more like a redundant and one sided argument.  He presents his opinions openly as facts and uses dated statistics to convince us they are gospel.<br /><br />Paul Johnson stands behind Adam Smith in an existential hell arguing with Karl Marx and a select group of religious zealots and liberal Democrats. The author seems to see utopia as a society based on a version of meritocracy where those with the means and good fortune to \\"have\\" should keep and prosper and those with less should work harder to get more or accept the status quo... resistance if futile.<br /><br />The message I read is that the capitalists should be left to rule this planet as they see fit and the governments should either help them or ignore them.  It is a comforting lullaby for those who chose to ignore that 30,000 children on this planet die from lack of sustenance  And very disturbing to those with a sense of social justice or who agree with most scientists that we are, in fact, destroying this planet to feather a few overstuffed beds.<br /><br />I wonder if he has ever walked across the campus in Cambridge or Oxford and gotten the opinion of the science department about how the greediest people on earth are managing our little planet.<br /><br />If your view of American culture leans towards the paintings of Norman Rockwell and you believe in the trickledown theory in an age when American money produces almost nothing in America, you will love this book. And may God help us.leans towards the paintings of Norman Rockwell and you believe in the trickledown theory in an age when American money produces almost nothing in America, you will love this book.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was one of the most suspenseful book of this series. Recommend this to people that like action. My friend is on the starting of the last one
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|The Dark Knight Rises was a film that had action, romance, drama and some conservative social statements as to mob rule and redistribution schemes that seem to gain traction with the low information voter.  Anyway, it was nice to see a film where the hero was fighting against socialism instead of for it.
0802473164|5.0|I am a relationship coach and recommend Dr. Gary Chapman's books to my clients, as well as to the people on my website.  So many folks go 'Wow, I'd wish I'd known that before!'  Knowing about peoples love languages makes it so easy to understand more of what they need.  In my own relationship I can tell him when my 'love tank' is getting low and I also ask him how his is doing too.  It's become a very useful method of communicating how well we are each communicating our love for the other.<br /><br />My sweetheart is an 'Acts of service' love language person, while I'm a multiple love language personality.  Being able to say 'Honey, my love tank is a little dry in this area right now', is a far better way to get my emotional needs met, than to be hurt and angry because he's not giving me what I need.  Plus, when our love tanks are full, we are both far more inclined to give more love to the other.<br /><br />This book really says the same thing as 'The 5 Love Languages', but it is put into a male perspective.  I highly recommend reading this book.  It will assist you in understanding how to give different people in your life what they need to feel appreciated and cared for. Even coworkers, parents, siblings, children and friends!  It has the power to improve all of your relationships if you choose to use it :)

B001VIMCW4|5.0|I freely admit to being a wuss and not liking scary movies or those involving a lot of blood. This movie is really well done.  It kept us entertained even though it was our second watching of it.  We wanted to be up with the story before going to see the new movie, Skyfall.
B0011Z5IXC|5.0|Except to occasionally hear them on a local classic rock station, I hadn't really listened to many of these tunes in several years. I zeroed in on Mothership because it is, what I consider, a very good sampling of Zeppelin's best.<br />And, I wasn't disappointed. I can't seem to get enough of these 24 tunes. Worth every penny!
B005LAJ23A|5.0|I've heard some call Season 2 slow and boring, but I thought it was relentless and heart-pounding.  The Second Season of the Walking Dead, the hit TV show, is back and it rocks.  Season 2 builds its characters effortlessly while introducing new little twists to keep you sucked into this world spiraling out of control.  Performances across the board are stellar, and the pacing is impeccable...albeit a little slower than Season 1.<br /><br />Blu-Ray Review:<br /><br />Video 8/10 - It looks solid and at moments beautiful, but the film grain is a little to oppressive for it's own good and there was ghosting that made some of the extended conversations a little dizzying.<br /><br />Audio 10/10 - Full spectrum mix that captures everything from the faint chirping of crickets to the powerful bass heavy gunfire.  Dialogue never gets lost in the mix, and everything is very crisp and clear.<br /><br />Shocking developments in the 2nd half of the season will have you glued to your seat, begging for just one more episode.  I would know, because I blew through the whole season in less than a day!  I have yet to see a show that advertises zombies and gore, which it has plenty of, but focuses on the trials and moral complexity of a world gone completely insane.  Favorite TV show?  You know it.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This is a must see every Christmas season. Contains the movie and the option of commentary from some of the cast members that you can listen to as you watch the movie. Otherwise, there are no other extras on the DVD menu, which I wasn't planning on anyway.
B0025KVLTW|3.0|I seem to be one of the few lucky people whose 2012 Deluxe Boxed Set is free from<br />warps, scratches, etc. And, for the most part, the albums sound great. But after<br />repeated listenings of MMT, even with the sound way up, it seems that the voices<br />are suppressed, or pushed into the background. I really wanted to hear Paul's<br />voice explode from the speakers on 'Hello Goodbye' but it doesn't quite seem<br />to. Close, but not quite. Wish I had an original MMT vinyl album to compare it to!
B009GEOLM4|1.0|I was tricked into watching this. Crap art. very bad trick. You made me think this was first rate. It was not
141659521X|5.0|I love Vince Flynn and his Mitch Rapp novels. Wish they would make them into movies. The book is great with it's twist and turns throughout the world.
0765326353|4.0|Good storyteller. good characters. A bit much on the self sacraficing overcontemplating hero. The book is big so worth the money. I'll get the second one and we'll see where that goes.

B008AX1HD8|5.0|I had already read most of the &#34;Harry Hole&#34; books previously translated and couldn't wait to read the first in the series to understand more about the Harry Hole character. Being Australian, this story was also of particular interest and I was impressed with the accuracy of the references to things Australian. Would definately reccomend that you read this book first if you are considering starting on the Harry Hole collection.

This was one of many books that I read, but absolutely my favorite! It helped &#34;spark&#34; my interest in the link between exercise and the many psychological benefits associated. I will be starting my PsyD next semester, and am sure I will use this book as a resource several times throughout the program.<br /><br />Thank you for the insight.<br /><br />Yats...
B003TH14H4|5.0|My husband and I will fight over which season we want to rewatch, but Season Two seems to win every time.  Which I guess means we keep rewatching the same season again and again.  The point is, the chemistry between the characters, and not just the main characters, is fun and enjoyable.  The witty banter, the put downs, the puns, it's just fun.
B004SOR4H6|3.0|The biggest issue is links open up in the Silk browser, causing significant delay.  The app should use an internal WebKit view to optimize the experience.
B0043WDK2G|5.0|My husband and I stumbled upon Castle by mistake in season 3, and ended up so caught up, that we bought the first 3 seasons and watched them as quickly as we could.  We enjoy this show so much, we watch the episodes over and over again.
0891419063|5.0|The vast majority of people today do not understand what it means to sacrifice a few years of your life for the good of something else. They are so busy pampering themselves. They do not understand what it cost others for their freedom. I believe people don't realize the hell that a combat veteran lives thru and how it changes a man. History is starting to repeat itself. I hope our young men never have to go thru this kind of misery and violence again but we are doomed to repeat histiory in the name of religion.
B003THHIEM|5.0|There is not another show out there that can combine put downs, witty humor and murder and have so many lead characters and make it work.  This show just keeps giving the viewer a reason to return again and again.  I recommend giving it a chance to capture your inner child, and your adult child.

B004J64QSI|5.0|Complete, very satisfying, almost indescribable experience; the only mistake I made was to choose the blu-ray version. Of course, I ended up limited to my living room where I had the blu-ray player. Later I got MP3 files and I also converted the entire video to my ipad.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|The Movie was a great prequel to what i think is one of the most important movie series of all time. there are a few differences but they are not significant enough to persuade me from liking the movie.
B005LAII80|5.0|In the 90's, Sylvester Stallone starred in the movie Judge Dredd which was one of those bad but fun action movies. It was full of all the typical clichés of a 90's action movie and some hilarious over the top acting such Stallone screaming and mispronouncing the word LAW over and over. Now it would be a few years till I actually saw it as I was just a kid back then and even a few more years till I learned that Judge Dredd is based on a comic book and pretty much all the comic fans hated the movie. One of the big complaints fans had is that Dredd is never supposed remove his helmet. Ever. Well, fans can be happy that you never see his entire face in this new movie and it actually works well in adding to the character's badassness. The overall look and feel of the movie is far more gritty, dark, and violent than the previous film.  It should please the fans and seems to be pleasing the critics surprisingly which is one of the main reasons I decided to check it out. A movie like this could easily be horrible and it wasn't. It's nothing more than what you'd expect from an R-Rated action movie but it proves to be quiet entertaining.<br /><br />  The story is quite a simple one. Instead of having a complicated story like the 95 movie which goes into conspiracies and Dredd's past, it focuses on a really bad day type scenario. In the future, the remains of the US are walled into a super city. Crime rates sky rocket and a special police force known as the Judges act as judge, jury, and executioner for dealing with all the crime and they deal with it very harshly. The most badass and feared of these judges is Judge Dredd played by Karl Urban. This day he takes under his wing rookie Judge Cassandra Anderson played by the lovely Olivia Thirlby. Anderson is special because she is a mutant and has telepathy and they believe her powers will be useful and they are. While investigating three murders inside one of the mega block, 200+ floor apartment complexes that fill the city, they happen to piss off the head of a powerful crime syndicate that controls the building that is lead by Madelaine \\"Ma-Ma\\" Magrigal played by Lean Heady. I give them props for having a female antagonist. She manages to lock the building down, sealing the two judges inside with hundreds of gang members wanting to kill them. It then turns into something out of a video game as Dredd and Anderson move and shoot their way up the levels and hallways of this mega building. It is actually quite successful in building tension and suspense in several scenes. At only 95 minutes, the movie moves at a good pace though it does have a very lack luster ending and a suddenly plot point that was poorly explained and required me to read Wikipedia when I got home to understand it.<br /><br />  The gritty and dark tone of the movie never lets up and there is very little humor (though it didn't stop us from making our own here and there). This movie is also VERY violent. If you have a problem with graphic violence, DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. A head melts within the first ten minutes and it just keeps getting worse from there. The acting is nothing special. There are no over the top lines like from the 95 movie. Karl Urban does a good job of keeping Dredd cool and level headed but totally badass at the same time but I do miss Stallone yelling `I AM THE LAWL!' We get no real character development out of Dredd so if you like to see character development in main characters you will be disappointed. Olivia Thirlby is the only character with development in the movie as the cliché trial by fire rookie but does well with the role and she is nice to look at. Lean Heady's acting is very subdued but you can tell she's evil and twisted in her actions and body language more than in her dialogue.  Everyone is more or less a cliché or a target to be shot or die in some horrible way. The action scenes are well done and specially the drug induced scenes where a character or more than one character are on adrug called `Slo-Mo' and everything is slowed down and given a heavenly aurora around it. It makes for some interesting and artistic action scenes. Now I saw this movie in 2D but everyone says it is amazing in 3D. If you know me, you know that I HATE 3D movies but I will admit that these drug induced shoot'em up scenes would look pretty cool in 3D. Does this is mean I'm going to go see it in 3D just for that stuff? Hell no.<br /><br />Overall, it's a cool little action movie that does much more JUSTICE to the source material than the 95 Stallone movie did and it should please fans. Even if you aren't a Dredd fan or know nothing about the comics in which it is based on and enjoy gory, mindless action films, you should have a hoot with this.<br />OVERALL: 7.5/10
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|After obsessively checking online every few days to see if this book was out yet, I finally saw it! On a Saturday night, the weekend before finals week. But that didn't matter; my Saturday night was set. Courtney Milan has never disappointed me, and she absolutely didn't this time. I loved the characters, the plot, the dialogue, and the ending. It is well-written and thoughtful, and doesn't fall into the cliches that so many romance novels do. I'm also really looking forward to A Kiss for Midwinter, Lydia and Dr. Grantham's story.
B008NMT684|5.0|My son LOVES this puzzle game!  The puzzles are great for toddlers and the balloons and clapping at the end of each puzzle are a wonderful touch!
B0053O89U6|5.0|I purchased \\"Modern Family\\" 3rd Season as a Christmas gift for one of my sons. He requested it so I am sure he will enjoy it. The blu ray arrived on time and was packaged well. I will purchase more blu rays as the need arises.
B004478GNI|5.0|got this as a gift for my younger brother. This was a simple addition to his collection at a great price.
0307951529|5.0|I've been following Chris' blog for a while and liked his other book (Art of Non-Conformity), so I picked this up. It was really well written and organized, and outlines how easy and cheap it really is to get something (business, project, etc) started. I really have no excuse after reading it to not take action.<br /><br />I took a lot of notes and plan on using it as a reference down the road. Solid read and can be read in a few days.
B005S39YGU|5.0|Finally a show for all us fringe dwellers of the &#34;perfect&#34; 10 society. It has science, science fiction, comic books, online gaming, RPGs, and laughs---what else could you ask for?
B009B53LA6|5.0|This is a great album from start to finish. Much better than their last release. Definetly like the deluxe version with the extra songs, just make it more complete.
B00005JNS0|3.0|The condition of the video did say good. So I guess good means it will skip and stop and such. bummer!
0345803485|5.0|This vendor had a good price, that's why I chose them and the item arrived before estimated and was in good shape upon arrival.
B00008O89K|5.0|This is a great album.  No matter what you think of the movie, this piece of music is inspiring.  And for you Arnie haters out there.  Just look past him, you're missing out on a masterfully made movie and a great story because of a face.  That sucks.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|This book is unreal. An insider born in a concentration camp which still exists TODAY. The horrific details of the survivor's experience are almost incomprehensible. This book should be read by everyone.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Not the best Reacher, and I've read them all. Reacher is such a great character that reading any story with him is a treat.

B000TGJ8A8|5.0|Watched this movie quite a few times on Starz. Bought recently for my collection after it came on a regular network.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Wow, i am a hard core fan, very hard core, however i was very broke at the time of this box set release. So when i am finally back and doing well financially i thought it was high time that i got the whole set and not have my loose dvd collection. All the discs are in very handy package with amazing new art work to indicate which disc goes where. The extra features took me a week of three hours an evening just for the first trilogy. A very good investment for a hard core fan, and a great way to experience all the movies in blue ray and a nice neat package.
B004IQMXD4|5.0|I bought this for a friend who has always loved Stevie Nicks...she is more than pleased with this album~ she plays it quite often
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I have read most Lee Child's novels about my hero Jack Reacher and have enjoyed all of them.  This one left me a tad disappointed.  It seemed that Jack Reacher didn't act like the Reacher of the past.  No matter, I will continue to admire the writing of Lee Child and enjoy whatever adverture Reacher gets involved in.  He continues to surprise me and I am totally enamored with this character.  He's someone I would like on my side in any situation.  I also enjoy the intelligence and knowledge of Lee Child.  I like his mind and the way he thinks. I hope he keeps Jack Reacher alive and well.
B00979OL5A|3.0|Not particularly friendly with touch devices, but it's free, so can't really go wrong. Prince of Persia is an awesome game though.

B009RI4FRU|5.0|My favorite movie of the year.  Was a scout in the 60s and it brought me right back.  My mental age of 15 may have helped.  It's just so sweet and so well done.  We give it as gifts.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I thought this book was great - wonderful message and was a def. page turner ! I fell in love with all the characters!
B0099TJ4YQ|1.0|If you have the original JT Christmas album, realize that there are only a couple new songs on this \\"new\\" one. I bought it without checking and when I played it the first time, I thought I had put on the old one by mistake. If you don't have the old one, this will be a great addition to your JT collection. I guess after six years I was expecting more new stuff...
B008KE3960|5.0|The game is free so that was a great start. It's fun and easy to play and is a good relaxation tool after a long day at work.
B007URCTOG|5.0|If you love Channing Tatum, then you will love this movie.  This man is a truly gifted actor.  The story is wonderful especially when you find out that it's a true story.  Wow!
0547884591|5.0|I have been looking forward to this book ever since it was announced it was going to be written.  I love the way Tim writes and I love how he delves into subjects.  I also love the fact that he points out that some info might be too boring for some and to pick and choose the sections you want to read.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I have used the \\"other\\" Mp3 player for years and never liked it. It took up too much room in my devices and is unique to it's own products. I am a freedom loving person and the Cloud player let's me be free. I can buy from many sources and the best part is it doesn't eat up any space on my electronics. The sound quality is superb. Ease of use excellent. When I had a problem today I talked to a specialist in 3 minutes. He took me thru a little tutorial and now I know a lot more than I did before. The streaming has been uninterrupted.<br /><br />It is an easier, friendlier option to the other one and I am very happy to let Amazon store my music until I want to hear it. I have nothing bad to say about it. If you are new to Mp3 music streaming, I recommend, without hesitation, that you start here. I<br /><br />I have read the bad reviews and I am sorry to hear people have had trouble with it. My experience has been excellent with all of my devices. Perhaps they have finally worked a lot of the bugs out of it. Anybody who has used Facebook knows about software bugs! Maybe my expectations weren't high. But my experience with Amazon and The Cloud player system overall has been better than most companies I deal with. As I said, I would recommend it to everyone!
B003YL4LYI|3.0|This fifth volume of the Ice and Fire saga has neither the fire nor the ice of the earlier works. There seems to be too long a separation of Mr. Martin's attention span as there is serious over-lapping of the story line. Possibly the author feels that his readers could not retain the plot line from &#34;Crows&#34; to &#34;Dragons&#34;. I have not finished &#34;Dragons&#34; and there is serious doubt that I will.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Truly a great love story... I couldn't put it down! I really enjoyed the commitment you feel from each character. Nothing is going to stop this from happening!
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|M. Scott Peck's THE ROAD LESS TRAVELED begins with, \\"Life is difficult.\\" Courtney Milan knows that and more. If you like Anne Patchett books because of their examination of \\"what if?\\" you will like--and probably love--Courtney Milan's newest. If you have a friend who holds romances in derision, give her THE DUCHESS WAR. Milan puts her hero and heroine in situations where prudence, honor, and loyalty demand that they betray one another, yet she does not satisfy the reader's expectations by easy solutions. She believes that it takes maturity and wisdom to love fully, a theme that ironically is rarely explored fully in romances.<br /><br />Although this book is fascinating, it's not perfect. The beginning is a little slow and Milan holds you distant from the hero and heroine. I didn't quite like the heroine for a while, but then, I came to love her; I loved the hero almost instantly. Even though you can put the book down in the beginning, it is so thought provoking, so interesting, that is one of a handful of \\"best romances\\" that I've read in forty years.<br /><br />THE DUCHESS WAR is different because of the intelligence and awareness of Courtney Milan. The central theme is the lasting damage that distorted, desperate, or narcissistic parents do to their offspring. Whether it is Robert's friend who is studying the controversial theory of genetic inheritance or the fanatical mother who mistreats her son to show the superiority of Christianity, Milan slyly unites this theme in its variations. Many writer have explored the theme of parental abuse, usually by the character's pain and her (it usually is a \\"she\\") eventual triumph of shedding her inhibitions to marry the hero. Instead, Courtney Milan shows a man who holds himself to an almost impossible standard of goodness and a damaged heroine who does the best she can for those she loves, even if it means destroying her own future. Then, in parallel dilemmas, the hero and heroine must decide whether to sacrifice their own happiness, betraying each other to protect more vulnerable people. Because life is seldom as easy as it is in most novels, Milan's books consistently explore the anguish, the uncertainty, and the grit it takes to lead a fulfilling and honorable life. It is impossible to read Milan's books and not to think, not to consider ethical problems, not to learn something about life. Most romances tell of fairy tale marriages with perfect happiness with effortless unity unto death. Milan's marriages are made up of imperfect humans, who often say the wrong thing, who knowingly almost destroy the person they love. Minnie and Robert have a vital, living commitment because both are capable of genuine love, honesty, and honor.<br /><br />Whether authors mean to or not, they expose their own values.  Clearly, Courtney Milan values fairness, generosity, honor, as most people do.  However, she is smart enough to know that these virtues are sometimes almost impossible to achieve.  Robert is so committed to being different from his despicable  father that he pens pamphlets to unite the workers for better pay and conditions.  I was taken aback when Milan tells us the danger of such an act:  it is sedition and can result in  imprisonment or death.  Then I remembered:  we are not the in the US.  Milan's humanity is demonstrated so many times in this book. The factory owner glimpses the horrifying possibility that if life had been different, it could have been his daughter who was reduced to working under such circumstances.  It is so difficult to write a truly good man that most authors settle for alpha males, even if they are werewolves.  Milan's characters have the innate attractiveness of true goodness, without the self-satisfaction or the rote superficiality.  THE DUCHESS WAR is an extraordinary book. Do yourself a favor: buy it.happiness, betraying each other to protect more vulnerable people.

B00AA7O22U|1.0|I know action movies are not always credible, but you have to be some kind of idiot to think that anyone can travel to a foreign country and do whatever they want and be undetected by the government.  Additionally, how strange is it that the only character that dies among the heroes is the one that no one knows?
B0085A9J18|5.0|The Raid: Redemption is a movie that I would recommend to any action/martial arts enthusiast.  The fight scenes are incredibly well choreographed and fast-paced.  It is extremely violent though so it might not be appropriate for all ages or settings, but other than that I would recommend this film to anyone.  Right up there with Ip Man as far as fight sequences go.
B003K16P3M|4.0|The author puts you in this fantasy world where special peopl have graces, gifts. It started out a little slow but by chapter 3 it was engrossing. Romance and adventure. I recommend...
B008DL466C|1.0|This is by far the worst cd in my collection and I own over 200 rap cd's so that says alot. The quality of this album is just poor. The beats aren't really suitable for Wiz's flow and it lacks any depth you could hope for in the lyrics. DO NOT WASTE a cent on this cd, he should be paying us for making his fans endure such horribly written and talentless music. Complete fail on his part.
B007W7P5L8|5.0|This is a nice case for the Kindle Fire. It has a elastic band that wraps around it to keep it closed and it also has an easel that stands up so you can watch movies without holding it the whole time. Very functional.
B008XNZMOU|1.0|I would pay for the guys in Metallica or Slayer to beat the crap out of this no talent Skank
0684857219|5.0|this book really goes into depth on the proper techniques of lifting, movement, and stretching for the aspiring body builder.  It outlines the proper nutrition and guidelines for what you should be eating for optimal muscle gain.
0316228532|1.0|This books reads like Rowling read Franzen's \\"Freedom\\" and said to herself \\"I can do this too\\". \\"Freedom\\" in an English village. Couldn't finish \\"Freedom\\" - couldn't read this either. Boring interfering characters.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft pe is a fun game. Me and my brow and dad play it ON THE SAME SERVER all the time.(I kill dem half da time) Creative mode is fun but not recommended. Mojang makes some pretty good games. I'm pretty shur its at 0.5.0 now. it is in mine because I downloaded it for free somewhere else. Anyway its fun u should definantly get it.
B008I3QZKU|5.0|Was a big fan way back with Somebody Told Me (do songs really get any better than that one?) and have been faithful with all albums.<br /><br />This one takes the cake ... gotta be one of the releases of the year!
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|I loved the survivalcraft demo it was fun. I recommend it to anyone who likes adventure. It took awhile to get the hang of the controls but I've  got it now. I'm going to get the real game you should too!
B007V80WUC|5.0|Thought Isolate was awesome ... this is just a little different but again kicks the butt of many of the genre! Essential!<br /><br />Sometimes wish they recorded more often, but if the quality of this is the reason why, I can wait again!
B00005N6KG|4.0|I use these with my ipod classic. They transmit sound well and stay put during runs. They are also super lightweight and fairly durable (I've dropped them a few times).
B002SRQ214|5.0|Very fast! I can easily overclock this to 4ghz without any problems, my fans stay on 2300rpms and it stays under 40c! Perfect!
B008KW43TE|5.0|I don't usually review music, but this album deserves some words. Frank Ocean is doing great things for R&B, his sound is refreshing and his lyrics are great. Not to mention he has an excellent voice. GET THIS ALBUM.
B007EECSFA|4.0|This book is such a great read.  I hadn't settled into a novel in a while, and this was the perfect re-entry
B005LAIGN2|5.0|These gentleman were very brave and a tribute to the history of this country.  I have an uncle buried in Arlington National Cemetery who was a Marine pilot on Guadacanal during 1942-1943 and had African American Marine pilots in his squadron in the 1950's before he passed away of a heart attack.  He said they were great pilots and a tribute to the Marine Corp.  I love this movie.  It took this country way too long to recognize their skill, bravery and determination.

B004SIIBGU|5.0|This eBay app is a must have for me as I run a successful eBay store.  Having access to all of my items for sale and being able to see the items I've sold when I'm away from my computer is so helpful. Plus I can bid and buy on the go too.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Thought it was a little hard to get into but now that I am through the first 100 pages there are a lot of twists and turns! Definitely unexpected twists and now I can't put it down.
B007THA4FI|5.0|J.K. has a way with character development that really engages a reader quite quickly. Something about her innate sense of people, and the depth with which she touches upon personal and social issues is outstanding. This book is a sort of series of vignettes so that the reader gets a whole understanding of the characters and issues that make up the small, fictitious town of Pagford. I could not put this book down and found myself not only attached, but relating to the characters.<br />Her career is certainly far from over and I look forward to reading more of her works.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|its an awesome game and cool I love it every one shops play it you all shops love the game its nice to Kern about
0756666937|5.0|I bought this book as a gift for my son who is 12 and loves to build with Legos. The full color pictures fill every page and I enjoyed flipping through the pages and seeing how much Lego has changed since it first came out. I would highly recommend this book!

B00127RAJY|5.0|Finally a set of videos that targets busy Moms that actually works and is something you can stick with. The time commit is stellar, short sweet and to the point. I love these videos and know I can do anything for 20-30 minutes. Equipment needed is minimal and Jillian keeps talking which makes it go much quicker. I will be doing these for a long time!
0307592731|2.0|I was excited to read this book but barely got through it. Boring rambling about how unprepared she was for the hike and next to nothing about what she really gained from the experience other than nasty feet. I don't get the hubbub about this book. Nothing to it.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Such a good read, lots of action and Katniss has a strong voice. It is easy to get sucked in.
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|This movie gives a gritty look at the racism faced by many, and a protaganist who is struggling to over come his many years of misunderstanding with his neighbors of different ethnicity.<br /><br />One of the biggest complaints I have heard about this film is the acting. Eastwood made this film focusing on a Hmong (pronounced mung) family living in Michigan - rather than cast Hollywood no-names to inaccurately portray the Hmong, he cast all Hmong actors with little to no acting experience. It really is an interesting story - the Hmong acting in the movie that is - and it made me quite a bit more understanding about the weak delivery on some of the lines.
0307730697|5.0|Adam's story was truly a powerful story of a journey rising out of the depths of drug addiction to one of a member of an elite fighting force.  We all should be humbled by what it takes for our military to keep us free and the dedication of their families to endure the times of separation.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Can't put this game down, I hope they update the pocket edition with other animals and a larger playing field

B000IOM0WY|4.0|Si se desea ver una pelicula con un buen vino y una excelente compañia, esta es la indicada. Entretenida, audaz y limpia en todo sentido. Disfrutenla.
0393088774|5.0|This was a long overdue treatise on macroeconomic policy that reviews the fallacies and truths on U.S. economic politics and policy, as well as very good insight into Europe's situation.  Krugman has exposed yet another area  where political extremism from the illogical right has been a major obstacle in solving today's problems. Keynesian economics has never been disproven, rather we see once again the basic truth to Keynes theories and the results of incompetent government and economic quackerie on the U.S. economy in particular.
B001FB55YE|5.0|que mas decir de esta pelicula si con el puro nombre ya dice todo, mas que recomendable. Esta pelicula pronto se convertira en un clasico del cine. Recomendable

B009WO7NQO|2.0|I love angry birds games but not this one. It is too difficult to figure out how it works and not very interesting to play.
0385738765|5.0|Wonderful read! Just as good, if not better than the first book in the series, \\"The Maze Runner.\\" Read this one in a day. I refused to get off the couch and complete anything productive. Such fast paced action, I wasn't able to put it down. CANNOT WAIT FOR THE THIRD! Word of advice though,make sure you have nothing important to do before beginning this book, because if you do, it won't get done! ;)
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I truly enjoyed reading this book and I cannot wait to start the next one in the series.  The story starts off with a little anticipation that keeps building throughout the book, which is what I look for most in a good read.  And even though we're brought into the &#34;magical&#34; world pretty quickly, I feel like I was still able to get a good background of the characters and develop feelings about them.  I would definitely recommend reading this book (and the series) if you're a fan of Harry Potter, Twilight, or The Hunger Games.
0385737955|5.0|Wonderful book! I had received it as a birthday gift months ago, but didn't pick it up till the other day. I got into it really quick. The mystery of it all kept me going. Such a quick and amazing read! I immediately purchased the second book and read that one in a day. However, I can't afford to keep going like that, so I'm waiting to get the third from the library then it's on to the prequel. I highly recommend this book; you will not regret it! :)

0385536828|4.0|SWEET TOOTH shows off McEwan's incredible prose style.  He's my favorite contemporary fiction writer.  But the plot lacks depth, I think.  It's a &#34;fun&#34; read&#34; but I have come to expect something more of Mr.McEwan.  Do not let anyone &#34;tell you about&#34; this novel.  It has its suprizes.
0439882826|1.0|The battery is not working and I gave the book to my grandson for Chanukah, so I can't take it back,  Boo on you for sending it with a non working battery. Will consider not ordering from you all if this is the way you do business.
B00A0NOF7G|5.0|Likeable characters (well, most of them), a brisk pace, great shoes, even better cupcakes, and recipes at the end - got MY five stars. Dobbin's deft touch makes this a great lunch or airport book!<br />BTW, there's a sequel...(grin)
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|Author has promise but this book is a silly  tale of college sex and shenanigans.<br />Who cares. Wooden predictable immature characters with little to commend them to paper. Skip it .
B0049P1VHS|5.0|What more is to say about this show? It is a gem. Highly recommended, but NOT for little kids!<br /><br />Also, zombies. =p
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I would give it 8 stars if there was room. This show always has me on edge! I love the rollercoaster ride and can't wait for the rest of the season in Feb!!!
B007WPLZAK|5.0|I like allot of what Masterpiece theater makes, but this is one of the best! If you are on the edge of renting this, do it.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Great file manipulation solution.  Talks to my Windows 2000 file server just fine.  Have a little trouble with WinXP desktops.
B00000255X|5.0|Dome years ago owned the vinyl album of this which I bought just prior to it being taken off the market after controversy surrounding Rueben! Some visitor stole the album and had always longed to replaced it but could not find it. When I found it on Amazon, when searching for the Modern Times Album we had heard about, grabbed it! Is great to have it back in my collection!
B0053O89Z6|5.0|If you love how I met your mother this season will thrill you! It kept me laughing and on my toes!
B0000CEB4V|5.0|after seeing a DVD clip of this tried to buy the album in Australia without luck. Amazon had it listed and have now added it to my collection. this is a really eclectic mix of musical tributes with Clapton and other renowned musicians showing brilliant style ! Had the US DVD system been compatible with Australian would have bought the DVD but the CD is the next best thing. Fantastic!
B0067RQYNW|4.0|The latest versions support Office 2010 file formats. Sometimes there seem to be save issues when editting the document but it's possible that is user error. Overall, very happy to continue to use as my first choice compared to other free Office apps I've tried.
B00005UKE0|4.0|Replacing  vinyl with CD after losing the stereo unit is always difficult as CDs don't seem to have the same sound but the third CD with instrumentation has always been a favourite. Enjoyable and great to have it back  in the collection. While it is to a CD I play often, there are several tracks which when played prove enjoyable and take the mind back to other times. The re release as a CD is one worth having for anyone who loves George Harrison's music and the old favourites like My Sweet Lord and music of Ravi Shankah. Many I know have not heard much of the third instrumental CD which I find more enjoyable.
B00AA7O6QC|3.0|then you will enjoy the action and adventure. Old guys shooting it up-Arnold, Bruce, Sly, etc.- It's fun and no thinking is required.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|Some may argue that this differs markedly from his earlier albums and therefore is not as appealing . However I just love it! I joke with my husband that while his voice is a little rapier at least he is singing in tune! Him being a Dylan tragic. The great man himself has it lost anything with age and the instrumentation is indeed eminently listenable! Modern Times may reflect his moving with the times but in no way detracts from his fantastic music ability and talent as a song writer.
B007REV4T8|1.0|I guess I expected too much,  the first 2 Daniel Craig 007 movies were fantatstic, this one after all the hype, had a very poor storyline and given the amount of weapons, intel, personell and money at their disposal at MI6 and satelite tracking, drones etc the baddies could have easily been tracked and caught and taken out before anyone was injured at the end of the film.<br />Disappointed James Bond Fan.
B000001ZS4|5.0|Had this album as a vinyl until many of them were destroyed by flooding! Having to replace so many items is time consuming but finding them on Amazon was so uplifting as was listening to it on arrival. also love Oxygene and other Jarre music. What is also great is being able to listen to a track online in the comfort of ones home as most music shops now have some other head bashing music blaring so listening to an album involves queuing and asking. Then charge twice the price for the privilege! Thanks Amazon and suppliers. Am able to replace so many beautiful albums we used to relax with.
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|This movie doesn't miss the whole Underworld mystique.  And yeah, we want more Underworld with Kate Beckinsale! Great history so far
B0000DJZA5|2.0|While always being a fan of the Beatles, was a bit disappointed following all the hype about the release of this CD. Seemed like it was an album of rejected songs from previous albums and did not appear to have the same impact as the red and blue 1960s album releases or white album. Not my favourite!
B000063147|4.0|This was not a gift for me, but I love the music.  This is a great addition to the collection.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a fun game I played when I'm bored or on the train...my daughter like it as well....it's fun for all ages...

1592332803|4.0|Hits:<br />chocolate almond brittle<br />macaroons<br />caramel popcorn<br />baklava (made this for my wedding \\"cake\\"!)<br />fall fruit crisp<br />lemon bars (soooo good!)<br />no-bake strawberry pie<br /><br />Misses:<br />Oatmeal raisin cookies (not bad, but they were just ok)<br />Peanut butter cookies (needed more peanut butter)<br />Chocolate chip cookies (just ok)<br />lemon cheesecake (didn't take cheesecake-y enough, relies on Ener-G and tofutti cream cheese<br />strawberry cupcakes (really dense, more like muffins)<br />blueberry coffee cake (I thought it was ok, not great)<br />breakfast breads and muffins were too dense, didn't have a nice crumb<br /><br />This was my first book dedicated to vegan baking and it was really helpful. However, I don't like that so many recipes rely on Ener-G egg replacer. It seems like a lot of the recipes were omni and then just had vegan ingredients subbed in. It makes it seem like vegan baked goods need fancy ingredients that must be bought at specialty stores. I was also a little bummed by the heaviness of the muffins and quick breads -- there are other vegan muffin recipes I've made that are fluffy and light. However, there are enough good recipes that I don't want to not recommend it. I think JOVB is a pretty good sweets book but that it shouldn't be your only baked goods book. If a recipe doesn't turn out very great, just try another cookbook!<br /><br />I know lots of people rave about the recipes so I may just have different tastes than the author but I personally don't love the cookies, muffins, or breads but I like the tarts, crumbles, sauces, bars, etc.  I also like that a lot of classic, familiar baked goods are included. If you're new to veganism, this is a huge comfort.  Some other vegan baked goods cookbooks can be a little more fussy or contain nontraditional flavors that could turn off new vegans.
0316228532|1.0|This was probably one of the worst books I have ever read. There was not one enjoyable moment. I kept reading, thinking there was going to be something, but it never delivered. It was dismal & depressing.
B0097NGUJG|5.0|Tessellate hooked me after the first listen, and the album has been on repeat for days ever since. Fantastic album!
B0085YAGMA|4.0|This was a funny movie. I purchased it on Amazon video on demand, and found the resolution to be a bit poor. Other than that, great!
B005IQZB14|3.0|This was an inspiring story of a woman hiking the pacific crest trail. It was a quick and easy read - entertaining but also quite predictable even though it was a true story.
B00138JATK|5.0|Oddly enough, I only discovered this album this year, on E Street Radio. I don't know where I've been. I've had Radio Nowhere on my iPod for years, it was free on iTunes. It never occurred to me to see what album it was on. Then I started hearing Girls In Their Summer Clothes. That was it. I bought the album and discovered that I knew most of the songs. \\"Magic\\" is magical. Utterly, totally, unbelievably magical.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Great show, great acting, great writing, etc.  Can't get enough.  Just wish it wasn't so long between seasons. Love that I can get it from Amazon so quickly.
0446580848|2.0|Pages 1-40, 288-320 and 580-625 are the only pages with any real suspense.<br /><br />This book follows the same pattern as some recent DeMille books (Up Country, Gatehouse, Lion)<br /><br />1. 40-50 pages of a great setup<br />2. hundreds of pages of talking, discussing (no suspense, no action)<br />3. hundreds of pages of working in DeMille's research (no suspense, no action)<br />4. Brief return to bad-guy stuff<br />5. more talk, more research<br />6. last 50 pages deals with bad guy using fists, no brains.<br /><br />I used to love DeMille, but now the books are too long with minimal tension. As if he doesn't want any of research to go to waste<br />so he spends hundreds of pages doing travelogue writing or providing characters who are either sounding boards or sources of exposition.<br /><br />I wish he would go back to Lion's Game, Spencerville, Nightfall, Charm School when his books had a beginning, middle and an end.<br /><br />Panther gets so complicated, with so little time spent on the bad guy...you will find yourself skimming quite a bit.<br /><br />John Corey's fists, wise-cracks and blather are becoming a big bore.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|This is by far the best Christmas album I own!  Pentatonix has amazed the music world again with their exceptional a cappella talents.  This album is full of delightful surprises-- from Kevin &#34;singing&#34; a trumpet solo, to Avi coming to the front and singing lead instead of just treating us to his killer baselines.  My favorite parts of this album are the more traditional songs when they go into five-part harmony.  So beautiful!  I can't wait to see what this talented group comes out with next.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|its fab how do u come up with these ideas.I mean it so fun to play and all my freinds play it with me.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|This was a very good book, just as with the first I couldn't put it down once I started. Can't wait for the next

B00061QK02|5.0|Who doesn't love Ron Burgundy? This movie is a hilarious classic. The only way you won't enjoy this movie is if you're a frigid old prude with a cork wedged between your butt cheeks. If you haven't seen this movie in all the years it's been out, then it is my professional opinion that you order this movie immediately. It'll change your life. You're welcome.
0385535147|5.0|There are few books that keep you guessing for over a hundred pages.  This is one!  Grisham gives us another reliably good read!  Great holiday gift for anyone who enjoys legal mysteries.  For those died-in-the-wool Grisham fans, \\"The Racketeer\\" doesn't disappoint.

B0053KWDES|5.0|The E11 has always been a great amp for the price, its neutrality is wonderful & the EQs do not change the soundstage for the worse, rather it adds body. Now! These babies can even amp 250+ OHMS, so if you need to drive something, get these if you need portability.<br /><br />Also get some velcro, you will want velcro.

B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I loved the first season and am enjoying the second even more.  There are more chills from the real-life horrors (aversion/conversion therapy, anyone?) than the supernatural ones. Jessica Lange as usual is superb.
159562015X|4.0|My boss at work recommended me to read this book the day before I left the company, and it has been an interesting read. It briefly goes over the psychological aspect of the book and then over some themes which you may fit into, and asks you to take an online test (a code is required which is within the book, one time use only though). The book then talks about the various themes and what your strengths and weaknesses are. I only give the book 4 stars due to the online test an the one-time use code and the book itself being very light on the content of each theme and the analysis.
B008XFB86Y|4.0|I did not watch this movie but my husband did and was actually pleansantly surprised by it even though he hates subtitles.  He is still begging me to watch it with him just so he can watch it again!

B00AHSMDQY|3.0|We were expecting something along the lines of the last installment of The Dark Knight.  We were pretty disappointed.  It wasn't horrible but it wasn't great either.  It was just okay.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I really enjoyed how easily this story flowed. The author made the characters real and though, you at times, you want to dislike Victoria you can't because she is living what she knows and living to survive. This is a book of life struggles and overcoming them even when society has set you up to fail. Victoria has a strength that is envious even if the path which created it is not.
0061726834|5.0|I was both intrigued and scared to delve into this one. It's a dystopian - and I think you all know how much I adore them by now - but the idea of love being viewed as a curable disease is what caused the mixed feelings. If the author could pull this off I was going to be majorly impressed; if not, I would be sorely disappointed - such is the case with uniqueness. I had never read Lauren Oliver before, so I didn't know what to expect of her writing style. Well, I can now say that I love this book and I am a huge Lauren Oliver fan!<br /><br />The writing is gorgeous, lyrical, completely enchanting. The plot, characters and world-building are well thought out and executed perfectly. Oliver has me wholly convinced that the world in this book could exist. It's like every tiny detail was crafted meticulously. Around three-quarters of this book is paced rather slowly, which I don't usually like, but the writing is so beautiful I couldn't help but cherish every word. And I feel the slow pace is necessary; it allowed for proper development of Lena and her relationships with the other characters, as well as Lena's point of view.<br /><br />Lena is a fabulous character. She has been conditioned to believe love is a disease, that it's dangerous and wrong. That the government has enforced all the rules, regulations, and restrictions with the best interest and protection of the people in mind. So when faced with people that do not agree with these ideals, Lena freaks. Her reactions are so real and perfect for her character. Oliver wrote Lena, among all the other characters, and the storyline and settings so well, the entire story is tangible.<br /><br />And I can't forget to mention Alex. Alex is completely awesome. I loved his and Lena's interactions. I really enjoyed how their story is written - it's detailed enough, but not overly so. And I'm not talking about sexual content here, just general getting to know you and hanging out, development, etc. Lena and Alex are completely conceivable together.<br /><br />I'm sure some folks have taken issue with the ending of this one. It had me bawling my eyes out, so I get that some may not like it. But I think it stayed true to the lifelike quality of the story. I adored every single page of Delirium - it's one of my favorite reads!conceivable together.<br /><br />I'm sure some folks have taken issue with the ending of this one.

B000ATQYT2|5.0|The movie offers the entire uncut version. The movie is a timeless classic which I have loved since my infancy and I am glad to finally have a DVD version to replace my worn out VHS tape.

B0053O89WY|5.0|This is hilarious. I have a great time atching this comedy. They are professional actors and smart guys and gals. They have a sofisticated touch on each play.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|Very good book. I was entertained through the whole book, wanting to find out more with every page. I've already recommended this book to a friend.
B003L77G6A|5.0|This is replacing Seinfeld or better is the new version of it, only smarter. I love it because we learn something new all the time, make us think. I do not believe in evolution but it is funny how they mock the theories.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love this app. even though you have to unlock the games by playing other games its fun to play to unlock.
B009HELT3C|5.0|I was expecting this to be tepid at best. It was really quite good. Closes the loop on the franchise, literally (ooh cryptic spoilery statement).
B006TKP2B2|1.0|I don't read a lot of science fiction and admittedly had to read this for a college course I was taking but this book was so boring and uninteresting that I couldn't get through the first third of it.  I know it won a bunch of awards and maybe the sci-fi hardcore like it but as a casual reader I did not.
B007M45PMU|4.0|The cuts on this selection are well written and my wife and i enjoy them all. We have told our friends about this title.
B004LP3AYI|1.0|After attempting to read this book for the second time (7 years apart) I made it about 4 chapters further and just could not take one more word. Im truly not an uptight person, I enjoy a hot love-scene as much as the next person, but this, this is something else...The amount of rape and would be rape scene's in these books are just redicoulous, .....I guess that is all that men-who-are-not-Richard-or-Zed do in Goodkinds world. Seriously, when trying to add an element of horror to your story there is perhaps nothing wrong with using this theme, but when you rely on it for an entire book it just seems contrived after the 7th or 30th time. Sheeeshhh ....get creative.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like the different games there are to choose from. They are really fun games too and I play them almost every day.

B008XHACWS|5.0|The third book of the trilogy was an erotic love story. Each of the two main characters are so endearing as well as exciting and sexy. Their love for each other has evolved throughout the trilogy, Christian becoming less needy and demanding and Ana more understanding and mature. I loved all the books in the trilogy, but readers need to read all three books in order to truly connect with the characters.

B004X6PRO6|4.0|I just finished the book. It is a story of love amidst the horror of Marxism. Funny in places and shockingly horrible in others. I highly recommend this book.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|All in all I thought the book to be a good read, exactly along the lines of what i expected going into the book. I did find the book to be focused directly on the author, as many of the other reviewers suggested. I would recommend \\"Lone Survivor\\"  to folks looking for additional SEAL reading, which I think is a better read.
B003498SDA|4.0|I'm sure that taxi drivers meet all kinds of people.  But it is not everyday that you pick up a sociopath, particularly one who is a contract killer.  That is what happens one night for LA cabbie Max (Jamie Foxx), an ordinary guy who dreams of starting his own limo service.  He has the misfortune to pick up Vincent (Tom Cruise), an ex-special forces operator who has come to town in order to assassinate five people.  Vincent is at once charming, philosophical and absolutely devoid of conscience--as the unsuspecting Max discovers when the first stop ends with a corpse crashing down on his cab from above.<br /><br />Vincent forces Max to drive him from hit to hit.  Out of fear for his life, Max complies, desperately seeking a way out.  Along they way, they develop a relationship of sorts--not a buddy relationship--but a symbiotic one.  Vincent needs Max's driving skill; Max needs Vincent's brazenness to draw him out of his \\"nice guy\\" shell, so he can put his destiny back into his own hands.<br /><br />The movie is well-acted.  Foxx is at times sympathetic, and also noble.  Cruise plays the villain perfectly--a complex character that defies stereotypes.  I particularly enjoyed the philosophical musings.  Vincent's worldview might be nihilistic, but he lives consistently with it.  Jada Pinkett Smith is solid as Max's love interest.  Mark Ruffalo, always memorable, has a small part--I wish his role would have been expanded some.<br /><br />The blu-ray transfer is good.  Virtually the entire movie takes place at night, so most scenes involve low lighting.  Despite this, the film grain is not too noticeable.  Detail is good.  The sound was fine.<br /><br />Parental Advisory: This movie is rated R for several scenes involving strong violence.  It is also punctuated at times with strong language.<br /><br />I recommend this movie for mature movie watchers.  While the violence is visceral at times, director Michael Mann has given us a glimpse into the heart of darkness--a man devoid of conscience who acts consistently with his worldview.  Pitting him against an \\"every man\\" makes for some interesting interactions.  How far would you be willing to go in order to stop evil?devoid of conscience who acts consistently with his worldview.

B005OCHOZS|4.0|I am a runner, so I enjoyed this book. Also, I'm a vegetarian and enjoyed reading his take on healthy eating. I learned good things from reading this book, but am only giving it 4 stars as I can't remember a whole lot about it now. I did thoroughly enjoy the book while I was reading it.

B00881VLCE|4.0|Fun, glad they finally have it so all of the puzzles can be played from one central location. A little glitchy but if you have patience you can work with it.
B008QMMEOE|4.0|Kids up to age 4 or 5 will love this puzzle game!  It's tough for kids under 2, but a good place to start learning.
B000002KHB|4.0|I had this music as a vinyl disk.  Some of the lyrics are dated but the music is still first class.
B009E3EXMU|1.0|I have been seeing this more and more in modern times with video concert releases.  They take a great performance, in crystal clear high definition, and butcher it with HORRIBLE editing.  They can't keep the friggin video still for more than 5 seconds. Constantly changing from one thing to another, close to far away, front to side, singer to drummer, WHO WANT'S TO WATCH A CONCERT LIKE THIS?  I want to feel like I'm in the place watching the show for goodness sake!  I can understand some editing so you get to see all the performers at different angles and audience shots along the way.  But not a new slice every 5 seconds.  I've seen far better jobs done from people using their HD cameras and posting them on You Tube be than this.  Don't get me wrong there is nothing wrong with the performance, the sound, the musicians, even Plant's vocals I can live with just fine.  But the lousy video editing on this thing just ruined the DVD for me, TERRIBLE!
B008SOS63S|5.0|I am a major fan of Joe Bonamassa and I am amazed at the output and quality of the CD's this man produces.  This is another fine concert album for the bluies/rock fan.

B003ZVJFFM|3.0|It arrived on time however, when I tried to watch it the movie froze in the middle and would not play. I took the movie out of my bluray player and cleaned it about 4 times and it still wouldnt play. I had to fast forward about 10 min past the part I left off on just to finish watching the movie.

B009HELT3C|5.0|I thought the story line was pretty good after so long since the last MIB movie came out. Which there was more of Tommy lee Jones but good nonetheless
1594203334|2.0|It is a story of a woman who is extremely happy to have a british husband and kids and living in France. While being American, she brags about French mothers!! Talking about lost identity. Only a few pieces of information that worth knowing about other authors. That is all. I listened to the audio book. Not impressed at all.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I needed something to help me write on my Kindle Fire and I tried a bunch of different notepad apps, and ColorNote has been the best by far. I can email blog posts, LiveJournal entries, send tweets, and if I send the note to myself as an attachment I can copy and paste into Scrivener with match style.<br /><br />All I needed was a simple word processor, and ColorNote is perfect for my mobile writing needs.
B009JBZH54|5.0|On the very same day the DARK KNIGHT RISES was released i bought the trilogy for two dollars cheaper, here, than the single movie was at retail stores! Crazy!
034580404X|5.0|I absolutely love these books! I want to keep reading and not put it down.  It's intoxicating and erotic!!  I just have to read more, I hope that more come out like these, because I will be in line waiting! I recommend every adult male and female read these, it will open more channels of love and intimacy, and help them to understand each other in a new light!! All I can say now is WOW OMG
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was so well written and kept you in suspense for a long time.  Flynn has done a great job with this.  Definitely worth the read.

B009K0P10K|5.0|Love the twists and turns in Revenge.  Want to watch several episodes in one sitting.  Recommend this show. So good
B00A6N7BS0|4.0|I enjoyed it! It was brutal, violent and shockingly sexy at the start. The two endings were clever,after the first one I was satisfied viscerally,but the second end seemed wishful thinking to some extent. The actors were perfectly  chosen for this story. I question however the lack of tension between the two dealers and their mistress,since both were in love with her and there was no clash.It was beautifully photographed,but more or less predictable given the low life type of characters that were portrayed. Drug cartel people live clearly live a life much like the Borgia's of Italy ,always worried about their backs and ultimately destined to be replaced by a larger predators. All of the characters were believable in their portrayal. I would definitely recommend this movie.
B0037VIBGY|4.0|I watched  this i with my girlfriend  who almost always  hates, detest, anmd despises brtish movies.  She finds them dull, humorless,  and just blah; and she actually liked this and watched it twice.  I just enjoyeds the whole thing and spent a huge amount of time laughing my ass off.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|My son's class read this book at school. Although I felt it an usual pick for 12 year olds, he encouraged me to read it for myself. I liked it too.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|A great addition to their anthology.  Definitely getting in the Christmas spirit with this album.  Brilliant arrangements of holiday favorites.
B008602KQI|4.0|I was surprised and amazed by the excellence of the Hunger Games books (trilogy), it being rare to find a near-classic in a hyped/popular Young Adult novel. The film version of the first of these books, The Hunger Games, is however not so wonderful. Good, but missing so very much that makes the books valuable. In the books, we learn young Katniss's doubts and questions of her actions; we struggle with her not only against the City and the Games, but also to find, amid the unreal world of Audience and Games, the truth or irreality of her love for Peeta, the depths or limitations of her love for Gale.<br />  This film version of the first book, however, loses much of this essential struggle within Katniss. To some extent this simply reflects a standard problem in book to film conversion. One other loss, however, may be more immediate to the viewer: clarity as to what is taking place in the narrative. In the book, when Katniss sees spots of blood from the wounded Peeta, we already know where and how he has been wounded, and it makes sense Katniss be looking in that vicinity; in the film, suddenly she just comes upon the blood spots. In the book, we know that her father was killed in a mine blast and his photo sits on the family's mantel; in the film, we can guess perhaps who's in the photo seen in flashback, but there is no hint--not a clue--what the flashbacked blast is about, or how this relates to the ongoing plot.<br />  All this said, the film works. It is exciting, the acting generally excellent, the photography stunning, the sets atmospheric and superb. Adults and young people will enjoy it. Only, it's not quite up to the book.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is one of the best gift that I have been given.  It has helped tremendously with my daily and weekly Bible Studies.  Preparing lessons for teaching it has been an asset at church, because I have numerous versions and study tools and aids at my fingertip.
B003UBTX7C|4.0|When I started this book, I did not give it enough time for the plot to grab me.  I went back to the book again and found myself so engrossed that I could not but the book down.  Great read.  Again, give it a chance to get going.
B000FBJG04|4.0|Mr. Ambrose has written on a a much examined topic of the closeness and bonds formed from the shared experience of combat preparation and combat itself.  He does so with the help of some very brave veterans, who not only faced the terror of warfare but the fear of sharing with the public what they feel.  The story is well written, enligtening and enjoyable.  The only draw back is the author's tendency to magnify the accomplishments of one group of fighting men to make them seem above the extraordinary of other GI's in the same war.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Wow!  This story in the end pissed my off.  Sorry only writing.  This girl was so good at what she did that it upset me in the end.  If want to read a book that will have you screaming and yelling at the end.  Then you must read this
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I just needed a cover for my new Kindle Fire HD, but found that the ability of this cover to prop the Kindle up at an easy reading or reference angle was more than I hoped for.  It's comfortable for reading in bed viewing videos without having to hold the Kindle the whole time.  And of course, it does what it was intended to do...protect the Kindle...very well.
B003NX76BM|5.0|I have nothing but good words about this book.  I enjoy the characters the scene description was great, you could get a since of the outdoors, the smell of the wood in the house.  It was like you could see it happening all in your mind,  We used this in our book club and each person absolutely loved the story.  This is a yes are a recommendation to read.  The dogs were the best characters in the book.
B001E0FRD0|5.0|This is my favorite book.  Amazing story of courage and sacrifice.  At times, it had me laughing out loud, other times I was fighting back tears.
1451695195|2.0|Not much of a story, simply an accounting and no proof, just the same as most afterlife stories, sounds VERY dreamlike.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I bought this for an ailing WWII Army veteran because I knew he had enjoyed a visit to the National WWII Memorial in Washington and I wanted him to see this homage to people like him and his comrades in arms before it was too late. As it happened, he had served in the Pacific rather than in Europe, but having seen both Band of Brothers and The Pacific, I preferred the former and thought he would, too.<br /><br />This is packed with stellar yet understated performances, not the least of which is Brit Damian Lewis' totally convincing portrayal of an American, and the interviews with the actual veterans, whose identities are not revealed until the end of the series, give it credibility without any of the cloying sentimentality usually found in epic films about war. Highly recommended.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Good family movie. Story line was great, unexpected ending.<br />Animation was outstanding,  Loved watching her red hair in the wind.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  The premise is interesting, and the author really takes it places that I wasn't expecting.  Check it out!
B009LRE040|3.0|It was ok to me I think it was not better than the last Batman I seen with the Joker compare to that ill give it 3 1/2 stars for the effort  ..
0439023491|5.0|When I read the first book, I was worried about what was to come for Katniss. That is the exact feeling she wanted to leave you with because during the whole book you worry for her. My heart was racing the whole time I was reading this book. I never wanted to sit the book down and you'll be at the end before you know it.<br /><br />Since we got to know Peeta and Katniss so well from the first one, what the sequel does is invest us even more deeply into these characters. It makes you grow closer to the people in the first one. The people Katniss cared and loved for are the people you care and love. You are torn between her emotions for Gale and Peeta. The strong and rough, the sweet and kind. So the book starts with Katniss as the face of the rebellion because of her act of defiance in the first book. As rebellion grows, the President sets up his revenge and it saddens you to see what will happen.<br /><br />This ending made me hurry and grab the third and final book. I can't believe what happened in such a short time.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|At first I was surprised by Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey's love story as I bought the books without knowing anything about them just because they were &#34;the best sell&#34; on Amazon.com.

B009715NUK|5.0|\\"Leaving\\" is a highlight of the Pet Shop Boy's most recent CD, \\"Elysium,\\" so I was very happy to see it released as the second single.  The song is deceptively mellow and sounds rather simplistic at first listen.  However, after repeated listens, the beauty of this song becomes apparent, as does the oddly slinky almost sexy nature of the music.  I think it's one of their strongest singles in years.  \\"Leaving\\" is about death and how we are influenced by loved ones even after they are gone.  The lyrics are quite profound and lovely, perhaps even a bit uplifting.  What really elevates the song, though, are the extraordinary background vocals (the video for the song cleverly places the singers on tv screens that really emphasizes their contribution).  The song ends up reminding me a bit of \\"Before,\\" although it is less danceable.  (Grade = A+)<br /><br />Along with this first-rate single, the Boys include three top-notch b-sides.  As a huge PSB fan, I eagerly await the release of each new single primarily for these b-sides, and they have really given us some tremendous ones this time.  First up is the best one - \\"Hell\\" - another clever play on a dark theme that only PSB could do.  The song is about various low-lifes (i.e., various dictators and serial killers) throughout history roasting together in hell.  The lyrics are at times stupendously funny (e.g., Lenin and Stalin \\"bitchin bout Putin\\") and the song manages to sound quite upbeat for such black comedy.  It reminds me a bit of their brilliant b-side, \\"The Resurrectionist,\\" released a few years ago.  (Grade = A)<br /><br />The third song is a tale about a Walter Mitty-type young worker.  He has a thankless desk job for which he is told he should be thankful to have.  He copes by escaping every day: \\"in his imagination, he's flying away.\\"  The song is a dead-ringer for 1980s OMD, from its tinkly synthesizer line to Neil's smoother than usual vocal.  The song has a sweet ending replete with an angelic chorus.  \\"In His Imagination\\" is sure to appeal to any dreamer and is perfectly attuned to the recession era.  (Grade = A-)<br /><br />The final track is a demo from 2003 for \\"Baby,\\" which was given to Swedish dance group, Alcazar.  The group apparently broke up before they could record it in 2003, but they subsequently reunited and released \\"Baby\\" on their 2009 CD.  This song is arguably the weakest on this single, although it is a pleasant poppy tune that features great vocals from Neil.  The lyrics are about a former couple who are leaving each other phone messages, perhaps with plans to get back together.  I prefer the version by the Pet Shop Boys, although the lyrics actually work better with Alcazar's male and female vocals.  (Grade = B)Imagination\\" is sure to appeal to any dreamer and is perfectly attuned to the recession era.

B007SGLZP8|3.0|The Racketeer by John Grisham<br /> is slow moving. I wish it had a faster pace.It is not as good as former books
0316069434|5.0|novel makes me stop my life, put everything on hold, and keeps me glued to it from start to finish, a process that takes, with breaks, a couple days. Connelly hasn't lost a step in the last two decades. It's all pretty straightforward storytelling- nothing fancy, no soaring prose, no convoluted time shifts, just simple, masterful, workmanlike, absorbing police procedural. No politics, no agenda, just basic Blue Knight stuff that is always and without exception a pure joy to read. You can see how Connelly is setting up Bosch's daughter to carry on after he either hangs it up or finally gets popped in the line of duty. Great stuff.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Loved the book,as usual so much action and adventure and the main part I loved was the scorpion loved it not going to give away anymore

B009E3EY38|5.0|It was one of the best sets that I have ever bought. Led Zeppelin ROCKS. I listen to it everyday
B009POCG5Y|5.0|I have to say up front that I like baseball movies, a lot.  Add that to my lifelong admiration for Clint Eastwood and the fact that I find Amy Adams to be absolutely charming and very easy on the eyes makes \\"Trouble With The Curve\\" a true home run for me.<br /><br />It's obvious that Clint Eastwood is slowing down a bit with age, but that just makes him the perfect fit here for the aging baseball scout who scouts for the Atlanta Braves but is having vision problems.  Since it's hard to actually scout anything without proper vision, his estranged daughter, played by Adams, who is a hot-shot lawyer on the partner path decides to join him out on the road for his latest scouting mission.<br /><br />\\"Trouble With The Curve\\" is a quiet little movie that may telegraph its pitches a bit, but for me that just added to the charm of the movie.  There are no major twists and turns, just a simple and heartfelt story being told with grace.  Adam's character wants to know why her dad abandoned her after her mother died when she was younger and Eastwood is reluctant to talk about it.  Both characters have their flaws and both of them have been carrying demons from the past.<br /><br />Justin Timberlake plays Johnny, a once hot-shot pitching phenom who was scouted by Eastwood and who then threw his arm out early in his career and is now scouting for the Red Sox in the hopes of landing a broadcasting job with the team.  His character plays nicely between Eastwood and Adams, helping bridge the gap between them and as he grows closer to Adams' character helps her understand that her old man may not be the cold guy she thinks he is.<br /><br />When it's all said and done, this isn't as much a baseball movie as it is a movie about the father and daughter relationship and a movie about why people follow paths that they may not want to follow.  The characters are all so very human and well played that it was a joy to watch.<br /><br />The bottom line is if you like quiet little movies about real people then you'll probably like \\"Trouble With The Curve.\\"t real people then you'll probably like \\"Trouble With The Curve.\\"
B007HACDLK|5.0|My family follows the books of Vince Flynn and pre-orders each new book that comes out. We take turns reading the book. This time the wait for our turn didn't take long because the book is hard to put down. My husband jumped the gun and ordered the book on his kindle even though we had the hard copy coming. Some books are hard to wait for!<br />The Last Man is interesting and quickly catches your interest. The story line is up-to-date with what is happening in Pakistan and Afghanistan, reflecting what is going on in the news. That, too, adds interest to the book.<br />Vince Flynn does his homework and is an excellent storyteller. We only hope there are real live Mitch Rapps watching out for America!
B0073LWEXK|1.0|TOO HARD! I couldn't get out of the first room. What is the object? Annoying music. I deleted it off my Kindle

B008IJT0CE|5.0|this is a good a easy to use app-even my cat can do it.<br />it is well thought out and pretty.
0307719219|1.0|The topic of this book has always fascinated me, so I was really looking forward to reading it. Alas, it was awful. The authors' main premise seems to be inclusive institutions are good, and extractive institutions are bad but to be honest, they never really explained what they meant--at least as far as I got.  I put this one down for good when they described the people who built Stonehenge as \\"English.\\" Since Stonehenge predates the Anglo-Saxons by, oh, a couple of millennia, this stuck me as bad. You wouldn't describe the Romans as Italians, would you? (The authors in fact, refer to the Romans as Romans). I'm no historian, so I figured if there was an error as glaring as that one, what else is wrong? Probably a lot. I decided it wasn't worth my time to figure them out. Do read the other 1-star reviews by people who know more than me for details. Don't waste your time.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Very FUN and challenging. The annimation is awesome. Most of the features are fast paced. I'm enjoying putting together my village.
B004SDSSFY|3.0|So far, I've only tried it on one e-book (PDF), and it does display it correctly, but finding the document you want to read is incredibly difficult, at first, and unintuitive.  A better toolbar is a must to make this a more useful program.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn is one of my favorite authors along with Clancey, Cussler, Higgins, Badulchi and Coonts.  I have read everything Flynn has produced since early 2000's.  Mitch Rapp is one of the most interest holding characters while reading his material that I can think of.  His books grab you from the first page to the last.  I have not been disapointed in any of his books as of yet.
B009SJ3GUK|2.0|I am on the 4th episode of Season 2, and so far I have been terribly disappointed.  The storyline seems to be going nowhere, and I hate the demonic exorcist spin.  Season 1 was interesting and full of surprises; it was bloody, yet very watchable.  Season 2 is disgusting and stupid. You would think a show about an insane asylum would be interesting, but all season 2 consists of is sex and gore.  That would be okay too if the show had a good plot.  I can't believe the writers created such a terrible story line for an actress as amazing as Jessica Lange.  She and Evan Peters are the only reason I am going to keep watching and pray it gets better.

B004LWZWGK|5.0|this was a great conclusion to the end of the batman series by C.Nolan. as a huge batman fan, i was definitely satisfied by the movie and it lived up to expectations. there are some minor holes in the plots, all movies have them but the movie makes it up with strong acting, good story line and tying the third back to the previous two. you can see the different phases of batman, in the dark knight batman faced someone who challenged him mentally but in the dark knight rises bane challenges physically and i think most batman fans wanted to see the fight between the two as it is one of the most famous in comic history. overall i loved the movie and is definitely one many people can enjoy, a must buy!!

B002PEP4U0|4.0|The writing style seems a bit juvenille but as one gets deeper into the book it's easy to see that the style is a real asset.  This book should be must reading in every classroom in America for kids from 12-17.  Not that it is only for that age group but it is the type of book that might just grab one of these lost souls and show them what they can do if they focus on their solving a life problem rather than waiting for someone else or the government to do it for them.  William Kamkwamba is an inspiration to me and I'm 70...but able to see how this book might have changed my life if I had read it when I was 12.

This book is a real page turner, the only thing it lacks is a real resolution but that just serves to set up the next book in the series.
0425170349|4.0|Rainbow Six is one of Clancy's finest, most exciting stories. It's the culmination of his previous writings, bringing together and referencing past elements and characters from stories such as The Cardinal of the Kremlin, Clear and Present Danger, The Sum of All Fears and Without Remorse. This journey takes hero John Clark (John Kelly) and his comrades of counter-terrorist team Rainbow Six, formed by NATO, across the globe in a series of connected events leading to perhaps the greatest of Clancy's threats ever envisioned. It makes for a fantastic novel-- several sub-plots come together and are fully decrypted in all their mysterious motives-- however, with such great expanse of material to cover and a wide menagerie of characters to explore, some of R6's focus and depth is lost in its own complexity.<br /><br />Plot is the name of the game in R6. This is where the story succeeds most, and the reason why I can call the novel a page-turner. Not one moment of the story was I not making connections, asking questions, and wondering what was going to be the ramification of each event or a character's actions. If you've read any of Clancy's novels, you know that he crafts ingeniously realistic scenarios and characters. This is a characteristic of R6. R6 presents many diverse people and asks many questions of life, but doesn't step back enough to further analyze each character, and doesn't provide enough perspective and opinion on some of the many moral topics brought up. Though Clancy doesn't directly answer questions to themes he brought up, one is able to see his personal views on scenarios, morals and beliefs through the guiding voice he puts in his main characters. John Clark, Ding Chavez, Patsy Chavez, Sandy Clark, and Popov/Dmitriy Arkadeyevich are well rounded, dynamic players in the story. As for the many side characters of several organizations with separate and sometimes clashing ideas and motives, they seem somewhat stereotypical, predictable in action, and shallow in belief. For a story on the verge of 900 pages, Clancy definitely devoted many sections to build up the characters of most importance, but it would have been complementary of him to go further with more of the side characters, since there are so many to keep track of and follow.<br /><br />Aside from its smaller flaws, R6 is a wild roller-coaster of a read; it would be unwise for readers not to pick up a copy. Clancy developed a gripping, action-packed thriller that hasn't been matched by many other authors, and is one of his most exciting entries yet. It's quite the steal at $9.00, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone up for an engrossing story.

0307744434|5.0|I was mesmerized by this book. It made me happy - it seemed like something I'd like to write. So I was happy for 2 reasons: that a novel this off-the-beaten path has made it not only to be published but with major fanfare; and secondly, that I could revel in the dreaminess of all the beautiful images. The writing is lovely, the ideas are lovely. Thanks to the author for putting this unique piece of work out there.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This is one of my favorite books I have read in a very long time. Unique story line, very well written.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|The Dark Knight Rises is one of the best films of the year. Christopher Nolan continues to deliver the goods for his fans. The purported plot holes aren't really plot holes, just quibbles from people that want to find something wrong when there isn't really anything wrong. Please read: [...]  for counter points of common gripes.<br /> Perhaps, I'll concede, a few things could have been tightened up, but minor, major (or even in between minor and major) plot holes that damage the film as a whole, I can't seem to find.<br />All in all, The Dark Knight Rises is a satisfying, entertaining, and nearly flawless conclusion to an awesomely epic Batman trilogy.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This one will keep you interested, I love books where you have love-hate relationships with the characters. they are (very) flawed but I still felt for them.
0399157565|5.0|What's to say?  The book is great, and it's tough (if not impossible) to beat the price for a book that's new and not used.
B00AA7O22U|2.0|With guts and heads flying off.......&#34;to me&#34; this was a reeeeeely phony movie! Unfortunatley these (with all due respect) gentlemen all of whom I've always liked had some really cheezy lines in this movie and the acting was certainly not the best. I'm just being generous by rating this with two stars.
0545157617|5.0|This is a wonderful children's picture book.  The grown-ups don't even mind reading it over and over.  Julia Donaldson is a fabulous children's author.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|I have all the seasons and I loved them so much I got them for Big Bang fans!  I just wish they would have left some of the &#34;trashy&#34; stuff out but it very little.  It's definitely a show for a little older audience.
