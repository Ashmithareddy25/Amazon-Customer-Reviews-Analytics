B00A757EFW|5.0|I was looking for a few games to have on my Kindle for the grandkids.  When I found this it was free.  My grandkids have not gotten the hang of it yet but I am enjoying it and reminising of the time I played it in my teenage years.
B009B8YZKS|5.0|Bought this for my youngest as he's a big fan of the Halo games.  Knew it was some microsoft production and didn't expect much however the entire family enjoyed this movie and are looking forward to a sequel someday.
B004KX5KPI|4.0|First, this remaster definitely has a clarity to it that the original CD didn't; I hear things I've never heard before, which makes he upgrade worthwhile to me.<br /><br />Unfortunately, both the DTS and Dolby Digital 5.1 mixes used what appears to be a DIFFERENT RECORDING of &#34;Into My Arms&#34;, one of mt favorite tracks on the album. In this version, it sounds like Nick is saying &#34;Innoo my alms&#34; instead of &#34;Into my arms&#34;.... I kid you not. Every time. There are a few differences in line delivery outside of this, too... not sure what they were thinking, but it's immediately noticeable and should not have been released this way.<br /><br />The CD uses the correct version of the song. WTH?
B000AXWV40|5.0|I LOVE this album.  the title cut is Eddie Hazel;s masterpeice but the whole darn thing is good!!!!!!!!!!!  &#34;Super Stupid&#34; is killer black rock funk........
B004KX5KQC|4.0|As with all of the Nick Cave remasters, this is worth he upgrade. I'm hearing guitar undercurrents and more that I've never noticed in all of the years I've listened to the original CD.<br /><br />I would have given this 5 stars, but taking off one because the Dolby 5.1 mix is mastered at an extremely low volume for some reason... cranked all the way, it's way lower than I want to hear. The DTS 5.1 mix is fine, though, and sounds FANTASTIC. Loverman and Jangling Jack gave me chills.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so much fun! Easy enough for any age. Very addicting! Must get!plus you can't beat the price of free :)

B005I4JG80|5.0|Fantastic read!  The author perfectly explains why French parents do what they do. I only hope it works for me. A definite recommend for all mothers.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have read some of Stephen King's previous books and watched many films based on his books. I have always been well rewarded with the appreciation for his works and have thoroughly enjoyed the time spent reading/viewing them. This book is no exception. It had twists and turns I didn't see coming and suspense aplenty! All of it was so believable as well. I became emotionally involved and felt myself expressing the same reactions and responses. This book was a page turner that was hard to put down, even when I needed to sleep for work the next day!
B004GHNIRK|4.0|After recently seeing the movie I decided to read the book. Surprised at all the details that aren't revealed in the movie. Long book but definitely worth the time.

B003K1EYM6|5.0|These do exactly what they're supposed to.  that's really all I have to say about them.  They also seem pretty sturdy.
B003IHUHYG|1.0|When I ordered this product, I was very excited to receive it!  I love The A-Team and it would have been great to get to own it and for such a great price.  However, when I received the product, I discovered it was for a different region and would not play on my DVD player.  Maybe it said it in the product description and I just missed it, but I certainly don't remember it mentioning it anywhere.  Very dissatisfied- now it just sits on my shelf.
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|I have so many THOUGHTS and FEELS about this book, it's going to be hard to gather them all up and spit them out onto this post in some kind of coherency. See? All ready I'm not making sense.<br /><br />I picked up this book from NetGalley because of all the hilarious negative reviews on it. I figured since it was free, why not try my hand and see if I can add anything to the discussion. I probably can't. This book has been called disgusting, romantic, ugly, addicting. It's all of those things.<br /><br />The basic premise of this crap is that Abby loses a bet and has to move in with Travis for a month. Which is fine and dandy, but WTF they start sharing a bed. There is no way a normal girl would do this. A girl with half a brain would not do this. And Abby seems to be normal at the beginning of the book - I mean, her and her best friend won't go to parties alone. I am assuming this is because of safety issues so YES KEEP THAT RULE. And NO DO NOT SHARE A BED WITH A STRANGER.<br /><br />BEAUTIFUL DISASTER romanticizes an abusive relationship. Travis is freaking scary. He dictates where Abby sleeps, what she wears, when she eats, who she hangs out with and when, where she goes, and who is allowed to talk to her. He beats the piss out of people on a regular basis, outside of the ring. (Inside the ring is a different story. There are plenty of pro fighters out there who are decent people.) Travis has dropped in on Abby's dates, he has literally thrown her over his shoulder and carried her out of a party for dancing with someone else, and they WEREN'T EVEN TOGETHER. That's right. Most of this disgusting, inexcusable crap has happened when they were only friends.<br /><br />But none of this would even be if Abby listened to herself and not her stain of a 'best friend.' Do you guys remember Vee from Hush, Hush? The idiot who kept pushing Nora towards the enemy and kept putting them both in danger? Well Vee looks like a right Girl Scout next to America. For instance, Travis just beat a guy to a bloody pulp. Abby is scared witless and doesn't want anything to do with Travis because SHE IS SCARED. Like a NORMAL PERSON. But America pushes Abby to go to Travis and talk to him. TO PUT HERSELF IN DANGER. Some friend. This happens over and over again.<br /><br />Abby is a useless nitwit, too, but I just can't even.<br /><br />Also, there was no plot to speak of. A relationship between two dolts does not a plot make. There were little wisps of plots here and there, with the fight club thing, and the trip to Vegas to save Abby's dad from a debt owed to a mobster. That last bit? Could have been a sweet book. But it was never talked about or mentioned after that; the only purpose it served was to give the couple a reason to fight. Whatever.<br /><br />Finally, what I thought could be a redeeming quality ended up being just as banal and stupid as everything else: the sex scenes. Travis is the hottest guy in town, with sexual prowess unmatched by any other student at Eastern. So why are the sex scenes SO BLAND. There is no foreplay or anything. They are so vanilla and boring that I just skimmed them after the third one because blah. Also, the night Abby loses her virginity, she gets her hymen plowed to dust and there is no pain, no blood, nothing. Come on, that does not happen in real life.<br /><br />Not all hope is lost though. The writing was a lot better than I expected, I have to say. I think some of the name choices were dumb, though (Abby Abernathy - really? Shepley? America? Come on, now.) It wasn't the most beautiful and evocative piece ever written, obviously, but it was easy to read, and really was addicting. This 400+ page book was quick to read, I read it in a day. So while it was maddening, it didn't totally suck. Just the message and the characters.<br /><br />I couldn't recommend this book to anyone. Ever. I want to be clear that this is not a Young Adult book, but it has been marketed as such and that's why it made it into my hands and to my blog. I can't recommend it to young adults because it sends ALL the wrongs messages. I can't recommend it to adults because A) I don't like seeing the stupidity surrounding heroes like Travis (Twi-moms, anyone?) and B) it really is a pile of crap so I wouldn't want to hurt anyone's feelings by suggesting they would like it. It was addicting and easy to read, but it really sends a terrible message to all who read it, and honestly there's not even a plot to enjoy. Read at your own risk.s and to my blog.

0547258305|5.0|I was entirely unprepared for this book. I really thought it was going to be a plot-driven action-packed fantasy novel that I could zip through and discard without a second glance. But man. Instead I found an incredibly moving, character-driven tale of adventure, intrigue, romance, and survival. GRACELING absolutely blew my mind, in the best way. Kritin Cashore has created a masterpiece with Katsa - easily one of my favorite heroines of all time.<br /><br />I fell in love with Katsa almost immediately. She's been used at the king's thug for the better part of her life, ever since she discovered she was Graced with killing. Katsa is lethal, and so she has been employed to settle disputes for her uncle, the king. But lately she has been having second thoughts, doubts about what she is going and who she is hurting. So now she is the head of the Council, and underground network of dissenters helping those in need.<br /><br />During one the Council's missions, Katsa meets Po, and simply can't get him off her mind. I loved that even though she can't stop thinking about him, it isn't insta-love. It's insta-suspicion. I thoroughly enjoyed getting to know Po alongside Katsa. The romance was slow-burning, especially for YA, and when they discovered their love for each other, I cried like a little baby.<br /><br />The plot and pacing for GRACELING were spot on. I was never bored. In fact, the entire experience of reading this book can be equated with sitting on the edge of my seat and biting my nails to the quick. There was never a dull moment. There was constant action, fighting, running, escaping. And I never felt the victim of an info-dump which I thought was wonderful.<br /><br />No matter what I say, I don't think I can adequately described how this book made me feel or how much I loved it. The writing and the world-building took my breath away. Katsa is a strong female lead that I can easily relate to. The romance was perfect - Po and Katsa were simply made for each other.<br /><br />I only wish that this novel was sold as an adult fantasy so that it could have gone as far as it needed to go. I felt that at some points the story was held back because of the age range Cashore was writing for.r.<br /><br />I only wish that this novel was sold as an adult fantasy so that it could have gone as far as it needed to go.

0143039431|5.0|I like this book it was exactly what was described in the review. It was a good read for me four tumps up.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I read this immediately after watching Zero Dark Thirty and it was interesting to compare the difference between the film and this book. This book has more information about what happened after the raid than the movie did which I enjoyed. It is a very quick and easy read. Only complaint is I wish it were longer.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I can't turn my phone on vibrate on the outside of my phone case. My case didn't seal correctly & look cheap.
B003IKMR0U|4.0|This game is really fun. Its fast paced and easy to learn. You can play it anywhere. However you have to have something to keep your score. It doesn't come with a pad or pencil like some games do. And the cup that the dice come in is only cardboard. For as much money as it cost they could have at least made it out of plastic. This could have been a 5 start if it wasn't for that.
B000CNESU8|3.0|Network is the sort of film whose pedigree seems beyond reproach. But as my track record might evidence, critical assessment of classic cinema is nothing new; witness my 3-star reviews of The Sand Pebbles and Citizen Kane.<br /><br />Network starts promising, using as inspiration the real-life on-air suicide of Christine Chubbuck in 1974. Alas, the second half of the film devolves into caricature and incessant screeching. As with Fargo, stellar individual acting does not a top-notch film make. Duvall et al are very good in their roles--Ned Beatty is brilliant in just a few minutes of screen time--but the narrative flow of the film suffers as its sensationalism grows. Perhaps Paddy Chayefsky should get credit for predicting the future, but somehow (and perhaps unfairly), his film suffers for it.<br /><br />Peter Finch remains reason enough to see this. He was, incidentally, the first actor to win a posthumous Academy Award, beating out the powerful 1976 tandem of [[ASIN:B000R8YC18 De Niro]] and [[ASIN:B0006GAO5Y Stallone]].
B0052BZ6X8|4.0|I rented this movie and I liked it so much I went a head and purchased the HD version.  I thought the acting in the movie was good and realistic.  At no time did it seem to me that the actors were out of step with the movie or the script.  I especially liked the actor Callan McAuliffe that played the supporting role as Sam Goode.  He was especially realistic and played his role quite well, brilliantly in fact!  The main actor Alex Pettyfer played John Smith and I thought he was good, but not brilliant.  Perhaps he was chosen because he was more show than go?  Regardless, his acting wasn't bad, it just wasn't brilliant and was over-shadowed by Callan.  Regardless, this didn't deter from my movie experience at all.  Its totally an action movie with a slight spin of Sci-fi and even more of a touch of Horror.  All my favorite types of movies all wrapped up in one good movie; The story of youth not only experiencing the first parts of adult life, but finding out that life isn't what their parents warned them it could be!  And, when the adults start dropping like flies, the high school superhero (John Smith) with his trustworthy sidekick (Sam Goode) emerges to save the day!
B000FIMG68|5.0|My husband and I are re-watching the Lost series. . . This makes for great date nights at home & I like knowing we can do this all again in a few years.  Go Dharma!
B003647BNQ|2.0|The order in which the songs are put together takes too much concentration. My idea of enjoying this type of music is to sit back and listen, but I have not yet been able to get through the entire CD. My only regret is that I purchased one for my cousin as a birthday gift. We both enjoy our heritage, but this is not one of my favorite things. Sorry.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I missed season 1 & only started watching with season 2, so I had to see what I missed. This is an excellent series. It's so nice to have an intelligent show on TV!
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|That's the way to send DVD Blu rays and Digital copy and 3d on 1 package great science fiction movie.
B0098VXBIA|3.0|The movie did have funny moments but in general was not that funny even though it is advertised as a comedy.  It does discuss some aspects of pregnancy that people who have never had a kid might like to know about and reminds those of us who have what it was really like (since you try to remember only the good).  The story line with Jennifer Lopez (the main storyline) is not believable in my opinion and it's movies like this that steer women in the wrong direction with men.  Just remember it's a movie, this is not real life.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I really like this little game. It is bright and colorful. The game is easy, but gets a little challenging with the bigger grids. I recommend it.
B002ZG99TK|5.0|This movie is action packed and kept me on the edge of my seat most of the movie.  They do a good job getting you to feel for the people involved not just the main characters but the supports too.  This is an emotionally intense ride but you want to climb aboard.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Good app. I'm 19 and have nothing better to do after class so I play with beauty. loo o_0. get this app.
0452273331|5.0|Today, we hear more and more about the concepts of collectivism and the ideals of groupthink.  This novel delves into the importance of the individual.  I know Ayn Rand due to her life story is a radical.  I also know that she has taken a fair amount of criticism over the years for her views, but I don't care about that.<br /><br />I think America is defined not by its mediocre minds.  Ayn Rand displays the cogent and easily definable train of thought throughout this book.  Howard Roark is a character that I would like to meet.  He is vivid and his complexity is in his ability to withstand the pressures around him to adapt.<br /><br />I also highly recommend this work.  I think all should give it a try.  The novel is one that builds on the individualistic streak in our nation.  What sets America apart is the ability of the individual to succeed or attemt to succeed despite the outside pressures of the larger group.  This novel is a great piece of American fiction.  While you do not have to agree with the story entirely, you have to respect the context and the verve with which she writes it.<br /><br />If we are concerned with how to handle bullying and peer pressure, have kids read this book, and see someone entirely impervious to such piddle paddle!<br /><br />You should read this book.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I love everything about this series! my favorite characters are  percy and tyson! they are so adventurous and full of action!
B007ZTLLMK|4.0|Arf!  This sim/game is a lot of fun.  The physics are well done, and the graphics, while simple, get the job done.  I play using the joystick, since it tends to provide better control.
B00AMBKD4K|5.0|was a great acquisition. met my expectations, very comfortable and sturdy. Optimal shock protection for your notebook. recommend the purchase of this product.
030758836X|5.0|I've never read a Gillian Flynn novel before.  Gone Girl was a Book Club choice and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it.  It was a real whodunit.  Could have been the husband, could have been the wife, could have been an outsider.  All interesting characters.  Very well written.
B009X01GJ2|5.0|cover is padded and the &#34;stand&#34; is very useful - easy to revolve the Kindle and set it up as you want
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I love having a story line that you can read and solve as you go through the puzzles. Keeps the game interesting but relaxing. Has comic book like graphics so you read your way through and its easy to follow. Plays like a good \\"old fashion\\" board game.
1468179993|5.0|I have found the presentation and suggestions in the book great. It gives me a whole new dimension in capturing the audience's attention and more importantly getting the message across. I like how concise, digestible and narrative this book is. I'm a big fan.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This series is the best : casting, directing, filming, photography, depth of the characters, character development, costumes, but most of all dialogs and story arc
0143123173|5.0|This is one of the best new series I have discovered.  It's been around for a while but I intend to read them all.  Walt is the most believable sherrif I've ever read of on paper and the stories will keep you coming back for more.  They are even better than the TV version and that's a fact.  Love Walt's sense of hummor as he looks at life through his own personal lense but the stories aren't actually humorous but real yet not full of gore.  Best western set mystery I've read since reading C.J. Box.  Mr. Johnson has the better combination of setting and cast of characters to keep us coming back for more.  I'm a clasical Agatha Christie and Cozy type reader but this series even makes me happy.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|its so fun it never gets old. even my little sister loves it! its pretty much the same as temple run but has way better grafics!
B000HKYOK0|5.0|love star trek..with the new one coming out..just wanted to give these a look..seeing them again reminds me of when I was a kid
B00B2V66VS|4.0|it is a great app but sometimes it doesnt load and makes me mad i would recommend this app for temple run fans
B006LSZECO|2.0|I really enjoyed this book ... until about halfway through. And once I got to the end I felt cheated. The ending was just too silly for me to enjoy. I wouldn't recommend reading this.
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|Shows that the 2nd ammendment is still in force.  It's hard to keep up with unlike the old James Bonds.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|this app is fun but a little easier than the first leps world...but there are a lot of new additions and changed graphics that are neat! I like this app
1600247245|5.0|The continuing saga of Harry Bosch.  Unlike others, he never disappoints.  Down to earth and well written as is usual.
0761119752|5.0|I love this book. The illustrations are great. It is such an easy read. What kid would not enjoy a book about pajamas? Sandra Boynton is such a good author. This is a cardboard book  and at a very good price. Any time I goto a baby shower itry to give this book.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a fun program and holds your atention. It could so easily slip into soap opera but the acting is superb and the characters are wonderful. Maggie Smith is a great draw with all her startling and funny lines. I hope we can get a video collections of all her stingers. Make sure you start from the beginning of the series or you will be somewhat confused.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Good game great graphics fun way to waste time.wish the accessories weren't so much. Still new to this but liking it so far.
B007MDB71O|5.0|I am a huge fan of this ERB series as well as his other works so I guess I am a bit biased but also I was one of the biggest skeptics when I heard about this movie being made. I was actually terrified that it was going to be typical hollywood crap. However, I liked the movie. Sure they changed some things, but after a couple viewings those changes sort of make sense to help it fit into a movie (possibly a trilogy, but also possibly not) for today and to be accessible to people new to the story. I do not want these changes in, but times are different and I can see how they work now. My kids love it actually. They do not know anything of characters, the long book series or anything about ERB, but they love the movie and watch the DVD often. They, like me, do ask where are the toys and other goods that should be sold along with the movie though. I got them some of the JC comics, but that is about all there was. The old Tarzan Conqueror of Mars toy line is around on eBay but not exactly at the prices one would want to pay before giving to small children.<br /><br />I imagine my review is not very helpful and will be voted as such, but I wanted to add some stars for this fun piece of entertainment. If you like the books, you will not hate this movie, and you might even find that you really like it. It looks good, has a good pace, is a lot of fun and is interesting.<br /><br />Edit: Just realized I went on and on about the movie, when I was supposed to be reviewing this product. I bought the Blue-Ray/DVD combo and it is a great package. You get the DVD, and  a 3D Blue-Ray and an Amazon download of the movie. It ended up being pretty handy to have the digital download (it is through iTunes) though I thought I would not need that. It is a nice package.
B007ZTLLMK|4.0|I enjoyed playing this RC helicopter simulation - the gyro setting worked great with the Kindle Fire.  The levels are clever and tricky enough to keep you entertained and improve your skill controlling the heli.  After playing this several times, I found myself thinking it would be nice to have more rooms to explore - the one room setting gets a little old. After learning the skills in the levels included with this app, an improvement for their next app could be to fly through the home exploring and finding coins, finding secret passageways, destroying other toys for points, avoiding animals and ceiling fans, etc. I would pay for that continuation, since they got the controls on this game right and the home premise is a good one.  4 stars as it is now, great game to pass the time.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Cassandra Clare engages her readers from page one. Characters are likeable yet flawed and the storyline is complex, but not confusing. Once you pick up book one, you'll want to read them all.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Can't wait to read the third book! Loved this one. Kept me interested... I hope I love it even more than this one.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I LOVED IT!  I DIDN'T THINK THEY COULD TOP AHS SEASON 1 BUT THEY DID.  JESSICA LANGE ROCKS ON THESE AMAZING SHOWS!
B008VBYN80|3.0|I like most of the game fine but it is to hard to get started and to hard to get frends
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|OMG!  OUTSTANDING CAST.  OUTSTANDING STORY LINE.  SUSPENSE AND SPOOKINESS LEVEL WERE PERFECT.  THIS IS LIKE CRACK.  I AM TOTALLY ADDICTED!
B00280LYIC|5.0|I thought the book was really good and exciting to me.<br />It was a cliff hanger at the end though!
B000068OCS|1.0|Ok, its life out of balance--so? Thats all? The producers show their  education and title is--lfe out of balance--so? Its been out of balance for 6000 years--are they trying to say their college degrees and Harvard diploma worth nothing? Well, I knew this for some time. In short, producers manage to find money for producing and distributing their movie and repeated things that been well known for 6000 years, So?<br />Get a life! And dont bother me with nothing. Yes, because you are big nothing.
B009B8YZIK|5.0|My son plays Halo and knows about all the characters so I was pretty confident he would think it was great!  I didn't think it would be bad but was very surprised At how good it was!  I love learning about the characters and story lines.  Also, the action and intensity kept us on the edge of our seats.  I wish there were more movies like this about the earlier versions of the game.
B000FJGWBC|5.0|OK, it's not great acting....OK, it's not the most inventive script....OK, it's not great ART....what it is, it's a highly entertaining B movie with all the ingredients of a classic Underwater film: great setting (the Bahamas), great melodrama (a sunken treasure ship..no, wait, two sunken treasure ships!), lots of sharks (natch) a nicely convoluted plot and a great, no wait, two great villains!  I've watched this movie three times and always been entertained.  It's a more than passable evocation of the sometimes seamy side of The Good Life in the Caribbean, and probably the best underwater photography ever, at least as good as The Big Blue, another great diving film. The soundtrack is also really driving and enjoyable, and made me a fan of Ziggy Marley, someone I'd never listened to much before.  Fans of Josh Brolin may be surprised to see him here.<br /><br />If you've got a flatscreen TV with good resolution, if you have a taste for the Underwater, make some popcorn, turn off your inner critic and enjoy!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|So lovely written and such a heart wrenching story of growing up in high school. I felt like I was there with Charlie and wanted to help be his friend. It felt real because it is a time we all go through. I loved it. Required reading for anyone with a teenager I would think.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|My childhood game can now be completed! I love this game though admittedly it is very similar to Zynga's Pioneerville. I am enjoying its time wasting qualities.
B005HSL626|5.0|My daughters love this app. They play it often everytime they use the kindle. It is a lot of fun and entertaining for children and adults alike, I think because it is so easy to use and to get instant rewards. Great sounds and visual effects that contribute to its funness! It has worked great so far. Only once it stopped working for a while but then it returned.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|This story goes on and on and on just for the sake of going on and on. It moves far too slow. I was excited when I started reading these books, but I will not pick up the next one. I'm done.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|My daughers have used this app and like it very much. They make nice &#34;pieces of art&#34; and they can save them. You can draw with different effects, color, change to a variety of nice backgrounds, and also add stickers. I just wish it would have more variety of stickers. I recommend it for your children.
B009FOBZL0|5.0|great mix of music and vocals.  enjoyable for this rock 'n roll guy.  a a a a a a a
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I am giving this a 5, because my daugthers, 8 and 10, use it all the time, although I don't use it.  It is one of their favorite games, that they play everytime they use the kindle. It does offer you to buy extra stuff, but just don't buy them, keep playing the game and it is okay, you will still be able to obtain extra &#34;stuff&#34; for the game. I think it gives you bonus pets everyday or something. I recommend this app for your girls, they will love it.
0792163710|5.0|If Shane is not the best western ever it is the second best. I own it and still watched it on the plane going to and coming from Israel last year. Great plot, great acting and a very subtle love interest that is only hinted at but unlike so many in your face story lines in more modern movies, there is no cheating or consummation. This is a pure and noble western in the bast sense. Even if you don't particularly like westerns you will like this one because this is not cowboy a shoot em up. Shane is a slice of life that just happens to take place long ago and far away out west
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I love this app, one I think you should have in your collection. You can listen to a wide range of radio stations from local, national, and international sources. You can create your list of favorites. I have found stations in Spanish from my country. You can search by category and your interests and it does save your recent searches so it recommends you more stations according to your interests. It has worked flawlessly so far with no problems. You can even listen it offline in car mode. It also has a feature where you can record what you want, and another to set an alarm or sleep timer to your favorite station. Great app!
B004T4LUPW|5.0|Better visualization that kindle standard app.  sync is simple and reliable.  Colors say they match gmail, but I didn't find it so, finally found preference under settings display general (the originals colors were not good) and it is now looking good.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Fantastic book. I thought I knew who the killer was, then I didn't, then I did Gain, but in the end I was only half right.<br /><br />Very well written, Gillian Flynn is fast becoming one of my favorite authors.
B000008GHW|5.0|Arguably Hendrix' best studio release.  Certainly my favorite, and I know that's saying a lot.  It's too bad a talent like this left us so early in life.
B005LAIHCM|5.0|I've heard so many people say that this movie wasn't good at all, but I have no idea what they're talking about. I love it.<br />It's not a &#34;scary&#34; movie, which is what I think most people were expecting before they watched it, but a thriller. To me, it was an emotional movie, because I tried to put myself into Elissa's place and think about how it must feel to have feelings for somebody and then have all that stuff happen, especially considering that, aside from being kinda crazy, Ryan was sweet and deep and he seemed to genuinely care about her too. Or put yourself in Ryan's place: drug addict parents, accidentally killing your little sister while playing, being forced to replace her, being abused, the cop knowing about it but not helping you, having a whole town hate you for no reason (as they didn't know any of his secrets), and so on. Can y'all really blame him from cracking? His parents and the cop definitely had it coming.<br />Anyways, if I didn't just spoil the movie for you, I really recommend it. Jennifer Lawrence and Max Thieriot are both very talented and the story line is pretty good.
0385335997|5.0|I read 'Drums of Autumn' and found that I needed to start at the beginning of the series.  So far I'm not disappointed.<br />Great Service from the seller.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I have loved this story for as long as I can remember.  It is always captivating each time I read it.
B0076DELIG|4.0|a good read, fun and entertaining, nothing really new though...Harry and Ms Mayfield in the desert... I thought you could figure out where the story was going... 4 stars...
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I suppose if you like Romance novels, it is OK.  VERY easy reading......kind of boring, predictable plot. I don't see what all the fuss is about, frankly, other than it has a lot of sex in it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Huge selection of translations. Navigation is simple on Kindle Fire. Wish that chapter advance took me to beginning vice end of following chapter.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|Such a great ending to a great trilogy! One of my favorite books. Will be in my collection for years to come!
B009ZQ8FQG|2.0|I love Downton Abbey but Amazon sold me a faulty bill of goods. I bought the online series /Amazon Instant Video  and find that I have missing/deleted scenes. How do I know that....my friends had me watch the DVD/BluRay/ PBS series and  there they are.  I notice that on Amazon some of those episodes are only 48 minutes long and on the DVD's they are not that short a time frame. When you delete scenes then we are truly not getting complete episodes on;Original UK version. So disappointing.
0345803493|5.0|READ THE FIRST BOOK , AFTER MY WIFE SAID THE SERIES WAS GREAT. ALL I HAVE TO SAY , IT IS A GREAT STORY.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Sooo timely!! Exciting race to find a killer/terroist, in the deserts of the middle east!<br />Reccomended by Amazon and a good one at that!!
B0045NDVFE|5.0|This is a great cd and a wonderful collection of songs! An amazing cd to listen to over and over again.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Excellent Ken Follet!! A very good sequel to Fall of Giants. The read continues on from the end of Fall of Giants and Is about the beginng and through WW11.<br />As always Ken Follet comes through as one of my favorite authors. This book also was a wonderful recco from Amazon!
B003NHRGSQ|5.0|I had fun reading this book and the my favorite part is the end because it was happy and amazing!!!
B003HARV3Y|2.0|I have not read the books, but based on their popularity I am relatively certain they are better than the film. I was expecting a film of similar quality to Harry Potter, I wasn't satisfied with the outcome. Chris Columbus is a decent director, the first few Harry Potter movies which he directed were alright, and The Help is good, but this was a missed opportunity. Shot on a similar budget to the first Harry Potter movies, I was expecting something as visually appealing as those movies were, but the CGI in this film looks unnatural, which makes it hard to get into the movie. The dialogue is pretty bad and the characters are more like caricatures, they are very one dimensional. This is a silly film that I expect a younger audience (grade school age kids) will appreciate, but I just couldn't get into it.
6304711905|5.0|My husband loves these type of movies.  He watches them often.  This one is shown on tv often but having the DVD allows him to watch it whenever his heart desires.  He retired this past year from 39 years of teaching and deserves to watch whatever he wants whenever he wants.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was so amazing just like all of nich' s other books. Katie was like a mirror of myself. Although my bed husband never hit me. He was mentally abusive. Verbal abuse. He was also an alcoholic. And I knew I had to get out of the situation. Although it was much harder for Katie to get away mine was luckily easy. And all in the middle was a newborn baby girl. I loved the book. Filled my eyes with tears.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This has got to be  one of the best books I've read. I started reading it because I saw previews for the movie fans thought it would be a good book, and it is. I'm bummed though  because I know the  movie isn't going go  be near ad good.
B007VPLNGW|5.0|I have played this game before and now I have it so I just want to say I love it kids love it sharks love it and its like angry birds only better
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I had at least 28468 coins,at least one million points,and a high score of at least 250000,and I was trying to save up for the toucan board and now I cant because all of that stuff is GONE.
B008H6GHL0|4.0|I liked the movie and the introduction of Ada Wong to the plot.  Leon S. Kennedy is like a James Bond.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|One of the best \\"real\\" SciFi novels I have read in a long time.  The author really knows his subject(s). Starts fast on page 1 and makes exciting twists and turns right  to the end. For non-techno reader(s) topics like the \\"hydrazine\\" episode could be laborious  but that is what makes the book believable.  Recommended reading for high school science groups. Outstanding!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I would recommend this calculator it's great! I really like the large buttons,  and it's very handy to have on my kindle.I use it all the time!
B008B92U32|4.0|Like the idea of swapping the faces, really funny. Only problem would be the UI is a little confusing but overall pretty cool..
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I thought that it's awesome but what would be better is that it should download for free without you really knowing.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I've been a TuneIn fan for a while now.. but now with Pro can't complain. The recording option and the 10 sec repeat is awesome ..works for me!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|fun for any and everyone great graphics spent hrs playing. children will really get a kick out of this one
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|it stinks so so so so so so so baaaaddddd lille really it just annoying blah blah blah blah blah
B0041KVW2K|5.0|Perfect sound, just love it... The Beatles were, are, and Will be the best rock and pop band of the history
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book feels like I wanna be katniss I wonder care what the charactors look like read this book the hunger games the first book read it
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I enjoyed the book especially since  living in the area at one time.  It accurately shows the abusive woman's plight.  I found the descriptions of the husband to be redundant and the ending was a stretch for being believable.  The character of Jo at the end was very difficult to be believable and hurt my feeling for the book.  It just makes me think the heroine was a little nuts.<br />The abusiveness was very real and showed that the author did his homework on battered wives.  All in all, I enjoyed the book and liked the characters.  I plan on seeing the movie.
B009G78EE2|5.0|Quite frankly, this album is my favorite new album.<br /><br />Great lyrics, touching stories, good beats, humanity and your grandpa's clothes.
0307730697|5.0|This was recommended by a friend, and I could not put it down. Well-written and gut-wrenching at times, the book provides an insight into the life of a true hero that other books cannot.
B009A3NGF4|4.0|The unique sounds of Mumford & Sons won't disappoint you in this album.  Great songs that will stick with you.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|I did not love this book. I thought this was going to be a steamy book and I could have lived with that it wasn't except for the fact that I found Travis to be annoying. His character was kind of nuts, jealous and insecure. I could not get over that everytime some one even looked at Abby, he went nuts. Also, I would be a pissed off girl if someone nicknamed me Pigeon, which is the rat of birds. I just can't figure out why so many people loved this book.
B000059XUP|5.0|this movie rocks i love the entire crow series hopfeully they make more , my wife got me hooked on them
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Fantastically engrossing book is the perfect mix of humour, suspense, hard science fiction, and pure adventure. I could go on and on about this book... but won't. I can't wait to read more from Andy Weir.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my almost 14 year old grandson.  He loved it.  I love surprising him with unusual things.  It was a big hit.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|wish easier to get free coins. and peanuts instead. of. paying not really a free app<br />or if we have to pay maybe make them less expensive<br /> they really add up
B0091REZMW|4.0|This is a great app...I love hidden objects games and this one works for me. In the beginning I did not like looking for the items in the dark...but soon realized this concept makes me better at spotting the objects.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Brilliant and understated music from a master craftsman that has now come top light, and what a light that shines.
B001ANYDAO|3.0|I found myself highlight a lot of text and if there was one thing that was accomplished - he forced me to consider a different perspective, I was not comfortable with the ending however. I found it hard to accept as a good ending to the story.  Maybe because it should have been a separate book and this wasn't the right setting for where his personal story could have gone.  The ending was heavy and took the book in a totally different direction and didn't bring all of his points together .
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Of course  it was good and of course it was sad. Through the first half of the book I just really couldn't  get that into . But I'm glad I finished it.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|The third book is as good if not better than the first two. I've never read a book series this enthralling. I couldn't put it down. There are so many twists and surprises. This is one book that is unpredictable. I can't wait to read the next book in the series.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a really fun game and ive only been playing for about twenty minutes i recamend it to all its really fun!
B007I2BZIE|4.0|I am a 30-year Rush fan and I must say this album is very impressive. Very Rush-sounding yet has a modern-day vibe. The band has done a very nice job with this collection of songs, in my opinion. Long live Rush...one of rock's greats...
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Great app, does all the amazon stuff that the web interface does. I Will use it frequently on my new tablet.
B005D0RDIE|4.0|Watching the rock band Rush in concert is a very entertaining, enjoyable experience. If you are a rock fan, Rush is one of the all time greats. They know how to rock and put on a very exciting show. A must own for any true Rush fan or fan of Classic Rock...
B004YF6MHW|5.0|Better than stock camera app. More options and my pictures look a lot better now. I have a Galaxy 3S and it really helps.
B005LAIHCM|4.0|This movie is a mind twister; it forces the viewer to think, which I like. A bit abstract and sublime, yet gets the point across. Great acting and superior storyline; well-written and directed cinema. There are parts I still have not pieced together but this is what I admire; a movie which requires multiple views yet still leaves me a bit baffled. Interpretations of certain pieces of this cinematic puzzle are intentionally left open-ended deliberately by the writer, thus there is no &#34;right&#34; answer for what actually occurs or what is reality during certain scenes. A very enjoyable and entertaining viewing experience, and in my opinion, this movie is worth owning. Last but certainly not least, Jennifer Lawrence is beautiful and is a great actress. I have also seen her in &#34;Silver Linings Playbook&#34; and she was amazing, as well as sexy and alluring. I feel this young, new actress is going places; something tells me we will be seeing a lot more of her in the future. She may be the next &#34;Julia Roberts&#34; of this generation. In interviews she is very real, humble, and honest. Wonderful actress....
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Way better than season 2.  I'm looking forward to the second half of this season, starting this weekend!  It's really about the people, not the zombies.
0061801313|5.0|What secrets are Spencer, Hanna, Aria, and Emily hiding from us? Will the residents of Rosewood ever find out?<br />Pretty Little Liars is about 5 girls who are all friends until one of them goes missing. Then, three years later she's found...dead. The four girls are reconnected when they all get a text, from the mysterious, unknown person named A, threatening to tell all their secrets.<br />This book is entertaining and suspenseful. Sara Shepard gives good details, making the story very well written. Once you start reading, its hard to put down. I would give this book 5 out of 5 stars.<br />Read Pretty Little Liars to find out what happens to the 4 girls...and their secrets.
B00511ONPG|5.0|This book was fantastic and has given me new insight on little tweaks to my job as well as confirming that some of the things I was already doing are correct.  It has been a great reference!
0439023521|5.0|Would you volunteer as tribute for a loved one? Well 16 year old Katniss Everdeen did for her 12 year old sister Primrose. Life in district 12 isn't easy for Katniss and her family. Ever since her father died in the coal mine Katniss has spent her time saving her sister Prim and her mother from starvation by hunting on forbidden land. But worst of all is the Reaping Day . Every year one courageous young woman and man put their names in the reaping. When Prim is called Katniss choses to volunteer as tribute for her sister. She is paired up with the baker boy Peeta Mellark. Peeta and Katniss train for The Hunger Games at the capitol with all the other tributes. It finally is the big day that The Hunger Games will begin. Katniss steps on her metal plate and rises up to the arena with all the other tributes. The clock counts down and the games begin.<br /><br />\\"Wow', I was barely able to put down this book a second after I read the first few pages got me completely hooked. I thought Suzanne Collins did a really good job of making this book because she put a lot of action and feeling in this story.<br /><br />What will happen next in the last book of The Hunger Games trilogy? Read to find out more in this adventurous trilogy. If you like adventure and thriller story's I highly recommend this book to older readers (10+).
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|My entire family loved this.  We have seen the movie, read the trilogy of books, and they have all been great!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Did you enjoy the Hunger Games?  If so you will luxuriate Catching Fire.<br />Katniss Everdeen, a seventeen year old girl with a passion for hunting. Soft platinum eyes, light olive skin, and jet black hair.  Just won the hunger games.  A battle of death for the entertainment of the Capitol, when the Quarter Quell happens.  A twist to the games every twenty-five years.  In this Quarter Quell every district will be having a reaping for the remaining champions.  For Katniss this is very bad.  She is the only remaining girl victor from District 12.  She is going back to the games for sure.  Who will be the remaining victor?<br />Catching Fire has extraordinary vocabulary. This book is brilliantly plotted.  Suzanne Collins did a outstanding job of giving me a vivid picture of the characters and setting.  I've never read a better sequel to a book.<br />I would recommend this book to kids the ages of ten to fourteen.  I hope you enjoy this book and may the odds be ever in your favor.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow.  I just finished this book, and I couldn't put it down.  It wasn't at all what I expected.  I'm not big into reading books about high school students (since I'm past that in my life), but this book kept me guessing from the start.  I originally thought it was going to be some cheesy romance novel where girl meets boy, boy breaks girls heart, boy and girl reconcile.  I especially thought this with the way the book started in one month and jumped back 4 months.<br />The turn the book took was dark, but it kept me reading.  I was able to piece together the before I got there, and that was mainly because of the storyline.  Once the cats out of the bag, so to speak, I was not too difficult to figure out the conclusion.<br />I don't want to give away any more than that.  I know that when I read reviews, I hate when people give away the plot and storyline during the review.<br />I know this book is much like others in this genre, girl has something wrong/misunderstood, boy has something wrong/misunderstood, but that's alright.  I try not to let that get in the way of a good story.  And this book has a lot of good story without giving away too much (well, except for the ending as mentioned earlier).<br />All in all, good book!!  I highly recommend!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I really like this game, but it takes a really long time to earn coins, plus I don't have a Facebook or any of that stuff to earn extra coins. I think you should make more videos and stuff that kids can do to earn coins on this game...I also think that you should let kids have an easier way of getting coins within the limited amount of time on the world tour! ;p
B007ZXK08C|4.0|It was good .. quite gripping - thought the ending was a bit weak though.<br />would read more of Gillian Flynn
B008OOYALE|4.0|This is a very fun game. Challenging as one creates your island and the different types of dragons. Enjoyable even if you don't have much time and can't or won't spend money on the extras.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|Apparently, I am one of the few that could actually put this book down.<br />But then again, I am not a fan of Romance novels.<br />My genre is non-fiction, historical novels and mysteries.

0740785508|5.0|James Gurney is one of the most talented illustrators around. Imaginative Realism is a rare opportunity to pull up a chair in his studio and watch a master at work. Although instructive, Gurney's tone throughout the book is encouraging and familiar. In other words, he addresses the reader with respect rather than the condescending tone I've sensed in other texts. He includes countless sketches, finished works, as well as step-by step photos, all of which shed light on his technique. If you have admired his work in his Dinotopia books and wondered how he achieves such amazing results, this book will inspire and encourage you. He also has a very helpful blog that's worth a daily read.[...]
0345803507|3.0|READ THIS SERIES OUT OF CURIOSITY.  IF YOU LIKE BOOKS ABOUT A LOT OF SEX, THEN THIS SERIES IS FOR YOU.
0865479186|4.0|Despite its rather broad-sounding title, the \\"bad science\\" is really science associated with the health, nutrition and medical fields. The author, a physician and strong advocate of evidence-based medicine, guides the reader through what constitutes careful research and diligent analysis and interpretation of results. He points out the many pitfalls that even the most conscientious researchers can unwittingly fall into. But mainly he also discusses various tricks that less than honest researchers - those usually with a vested interest in some specific outcome of the experiments/research (e.g., some alternative medicine practitioners, some pharmaceutical companies, some nutritionists, even some physicians, etc.) - will use to promote their ideologies, products, etc., even when these have been proven worthless by honest, careful researchers. Carl Sagan's view that \\"extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence\\" features prominently throughout this book.<br /><br />This author is not afraid to express his views - especially when sloppy research and/or dishonesty is involved. His prose is quite lively, authoritative, friendly, often witty and fast-paced. Anyone interested in the use and abuse of science should thoroughly enjoy this book.

B00589WJAM|4.0|I had never heard of Vintage Trouble until they opened for The Who last night in Phoenix.<br /><br />By the third song I had looked them up on Amazon and had already ordered the CD for delivery on Friday.<br /><br />As a fan of Blues, Classic rock and roll and even a bit of soul Vintage Trouble really hit the spot.  While listening to them I heard glimmers of Ike and Iina, ZZ Top, classic soul, Free and maybe a bit of James Brown.  The retro look, feel and sound works.  It did not seem forced or a fake masquerade.  It was a genuine sound and music experience.<br /><br />I can second another reviewer's comments that to open for The Who are some pretty big shoes to fill.  They had the audience engaged and jumping by the end and it was only a 30 minute set.  The can fill those shoes!<br /><br />Invest in tis CD and get in on the ground floor!

B00742GBDM|1.0|This can be fun to watch if you don't think about the novel; the vision is very different and the director had her own movitation for transforming Austen's book into a film. The Fanny Price character in the film is inspired by the young Jane Austen's writings rather than the character in the book.  To be fair, it would be hard to make a compelling movie while being faithful to the book.  All the other characters are well cast and it's fun to watch.  Just don't expect it to be the \\"Mansfield Park\\" you've read and you'll be fine!

B008220BLG|4.0|Directed by Jonathan Levine, from a screenplay he adapted from the novel by Isaac Marion, Warm Bodies is one of those weird cross-genre films - A romantic zombie flick? Really? - that has the potential to be either truly fun or truly awful.  Fortunately for everyone concerned, Warm Bodies is truly fun.  It's also a really well done film, the all too rare kind where the direction, the script, the actors, the cinematography and the make-up and effects, all mesh together perfectly and make the resulting whole far more than the sum of its parts.<br /><br />Set in a genre-standard post-apocalyptic near-future where the world has been overrun by zombies and what's left of humanity has retreated to fortress-like enclaves, the film begins with an inner monologue narration from the mind - or what's left of it - of a walking-dead boy (superbly played by Nicholas Hoult) named \\"R\\".  (He used to have a name but all he can remember now is that it began with an \\"R\\".)  In a hilariously deadpan stream of consciousness, he tells us about his existence - you can't really call it \\"life\\" after all - shuffling around an abandoned airport, bumping into other zombies, and periodically getting hungry and going off after the only thing zombies ever seem to eat - humans.  The only connection R has is to another zombie named \\"M\\" (Rob Corddry), who, like him, still possesses a flicker of brain activity:<br /><br />\\"This is my best friend. By best friend I mean we occasionally grunt and stare awkwardly at each other. We even have almost conversations sometimes. Days pass this way but sometimes we even find actual words, words like 'hungry' and 'city.' \\"<br /><br />R also has connections to a handful of objects he finds - snow globes, vinyl records and such - and keeps in a derelict jet he hangs out in when he not busy shuffling around and going off to eat people.  He's not even sure why he keeps them anymore except that, now and then, they seem to stir some memory or echo of a memory in him. Which helps keep him from sliding further down the zombie slope, at the bottom of which are the \\"bonies\\" -  desiccated, skin-covered skeletons with no trace of humanity left.  \\"They'll eat anything with a heartbeat,\\" R tells us, immediately adding \\"I mean, I will too, but at least I'm conflicted about it.\\"<br /><br />Not too far from the airport is a former sports stadium that a group of humans led by General Grigio (John Malkovich) has turned into a walled fortress.  Periodically they have to send out foraging parties into the city to scrounge for things like medical supplies.  Young people are recruited to be the foragers, mainly because they can run the fastest, an important survival trait in any zombie apocalypse. One of these parties that gets sent out includes Grigio's daughter, Julie (a very convincing Teresa Palmer), her boyfriend Perry (Dave Franco), and her best friend Nora (Analeigh Tipton).<br /><br />And as fate would have it, when R and M and a gaggle of other zombies go shuffling out of the airport in search of human flesh, they stumble across Julie and her fellow scroungers in an abandoned pharmacy.  During the fight, R ends up killing and eating Perry's brain (to be fair though, this was after Perry shot him).  As R explains, one of the reasons zombies are so drawn to eat brains is because by doing so, they experience, at least temporarily, the memories of the person they're eating.  It's the closest thing they can experience to being alive once more, hence their monomaniacal interest in craving brains.  And having eaten Perry's brain, the moment R encounters Julie and their eyes meet, he experiences Perry's love for her, immediately feeling compelled not to eat her but to save her, setting into motion a chain of events that will change them and everyone around them.<br /><br />There's a not-so-subtle undercurrent of Romeo and Juliet worked into the plot - sans most of the angst - which you can see in the names of the principal characters:  \\"R\\" for Romeo, \\"Julie\\" for Juliet, \\"M\\" for Mercutio, \\"Perry\\" for Paris (especially if you use the French pronunciation, i.e. Pa-ree), and \\"Nora\\", who wants to be a nurse, for The Nurse. It may sound a bit cheesy, but it's cleverly done and it works surprisingly well.<br /><br />The performaces are quite good for the most part. Nicholas Hoult (About a Boy, X-Men: First Class) shines as R, managing to be appropriately dead-faced and shuffling as a zombie while allowing his flicker of humanity to be seen first solely through his eyes, then slowly and gradually becoming more expressive as his contact with Julie causes him to change.  Teresa Palmer (December Boys, I am Number Four) brings believability to Julie, showing a wary toughness that marks her as a survivor but also a willingness to see the changes in R and to respond to them. It also doesn't hurt that Palmer is actually athletic enough to make her running scenes look authentic - you have no trouble believing that this girl could indeed outrun a pack of hungry zombies. Rob Corddry (Hot Tub Time Machine, Seeking a Friend for the End of the World) is subtly effective as R's fellow zombie M, in whom the changes being wrought are more visible and in some ways more keenly felt. On the slightly minus side, John Malkovich plays his General Grigio as something of a stock Malkovich portrayal, the kind you're familiar with from a lot of his movies, from Con Air and Red to Burn Before Reading. It's not bad, but you never get a sense that you're seeing anything but John Malkovich going through his paces. The film would probably have been better off with someone less well known in the role.<br /><br />For those of you who've read the book, the film follows the book reasonably closely.  The film is, I think, lighter in tone in a number of places.  Perry's role has been trimmed a fair amount to keep the focus on R and Julie.  And the hierarchy between the bonies and ordinary zombies isn't as clearly drawn.  The only reason I don't rate this a full five stars though is because of one significant difference in how the climactic confrontation plays out for the main characters.  I won't spoil anything by laying it out, but it'll be obvious to anyone who's read the book and I think the film would've been better if it had followed the book in this case.<br /><br />But all that said, it's remarkable at how well Warm Bodies actually works as a film. It stays true to the basic tropes of the zombie apocalypse genre, making it work for zombie-film fans, but also manages to blend in both comedic and romantic elements in a believable way, making it work in those genres as well.<br /><br />Highly recommended as, however improbable this must sound, a fun romantic zombie film that everyone can enjoy.eo, \\"Julie\\" for Juliet, \\"M\\" for Mercutio, \\"Perry\\" for Paris (especially if you use the French pronunciation, i.e. Pa-ree), and \\"Nora\\", who wants to be a nurse, for The Nurse.

B00B0LPYXG|2.0|This movie was little more than a 2-hour, 9-minute ad for AA.  Even that's okay if that's what you're signing up to watch. Amazon describes it as a \\"thriller\\".  Hardly.  Also, strains the credibility factor.  A man who refuses to admit his addiction is unlikely to do so when he has the most to lose. It actually seemed a tad cliché. Even though the plane crashes, it is not due to pilot error. Nicole's (the woman Washington 's character meets in the hospital) struggle to overcome addiction seems like a far more interesting story.<br /><br />I saw a review describing this as Washington's least sympathetic role to date.  Nope, that was, \\"Training Day.\\" It still boggles the mind that he received an Oscar for THAT performance.<br /><br />It seemed as though someone with mega-resources at his disposal perhaps used this film as a means of working out his own substance abuse issues.<br /><br />Don Cheadle, excellent as always.

B005WUHAX8|4.0|i love the case!  it made my phone a little bigger then it was otherwise.  but it really is waterproof and works great.  i've never taken it off.  my only complaint is that b/c there is a layer protecting the screen, sometimes the outter layer gets sweat bubbles trapped under it and you can see the blemish on the screen while using.  but it hasn't been a big bother at all and it is worth the protection!
B004X75RK4|5.0|As I am a big fan of chick flicks, I will acknowledge that my review will be prejudice to this genre. With that in mind, I do have some standards: that the chemistry be evident between the characters; that the dialog be clever – I appreciate sarcasm and quick witted exchanges; that there be some physical comedy, but not overly much; that the ending provide a sense of happiness in the results.<br />This movie meets all of the above. I purchase DVDs so that I may watch favorite entertainment as my mood dictates and as much as I wish, and this movie also fits that requirement – a feel good movie that no matter how many times I watch it, I still smile, chuckle and tear up.

B00AZRBLHO|5.0|It's a hell of example of an IT novel that even my mother can understand!!!<br />I started reading and couldn't do anything else till I got to the last page. At 3AM I got ... it was reading the excerpt!!!! Bought the book and spent the following hours reading just to see how it ends. Then, I spent the following 2 days reviewing the book to learn the key concepts.<br />This book is the IT version of &#34;The Goal&#34; by Eliyahu M. Goldratt and if you are a developer or an IT guy, it will help you understand the struggle your bosses face every day.
B00AE2J5HI|1.0|Unless you relish Lawlessess, don't polute your mind with this one.  Was hoping for some edgy, period drama.  Movie managed to capture a &#34;mood,&#34; but no interesting plot, even less substance.  Belabored ugliness, intensely overacted.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Far too long and not even remotely believeable. I don't at all see what the hype is. I don't recommend it.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I really love this game.  The graphics are great &amp; I love the animals.  Problem is that the game keeps taking me back to Level 1,  regardless of what level I am.  I have to turn off my Kindle &amp; restart &amp; then my correct level is back.  Used to happen occasionally, but now it is happening all the time :(
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is for a person who likes adventure and humor. The book had lots of excitement,  lots of scares, and even some romance.

B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This game is fantastically fun. I would suggest this game to anyone looking to challenge their mind while just enjoying the time.
B005OCFHHK|2.0|I had passed up another less expensive 8-disc boxed set (the UK version) because the title of the first film was &#34;The Philosopher's Stone&#34; (as opposed to the US version &#34;Sorcerer's Stone&#34;). So I paid slightly more since this description stated &#34;The Sorcerer's Stone&#34;. Then when it showed up at my door, it was the UK version instead of the US version.<br /><br />I know it's a small thing, and the films work great and all that, but it was the single selling point why I went with this set versus another, and then it turned out to be inaccurate.
1847879071|5.0|This is a great stat book for anyone like me who has been traumatized in the past by the subject. It uses real world examples (some quite funny) and suddenly statistics makes sense. Love the author's style. I have not used the SPSS tutorials but they seem easy to follow.

B00A9X9TIW|1.0|This movie was crass and unnecessarily bloody and violent.  I don't know what I was expecting, but was expecting more.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I would defiantly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys sci-fi, fantasy, or books that address world issues. I'm not a huge reader however this book has kept my attention and then some, it's the kind of book you're itching to read to see what happens next. . .
B00AJLHUA8|5.0|I have to say enjoyed this movie.  It really surprised me at the end; it was something that I appreciated because there was no tell tail sign of it coming.

B005HJU7HA|3.0|I enjoyed reading the stories of Sherlock Holmes, and I will not dispute that they are well-written. My issue is the the character himself. He is deeply flawed, and I found that irritating from time to time. Also, I was very disappointed with Study in Scarlet and Sign of Four. Watson refers to them as Holmes' greatest cases, so I was expecting quite a bit from them. However, they turned out to be just run-of-the-mill cases. Certainly nothing more impressive than some of the other stories. That being said, I really did like reading this collection. It's fun to see the mystery unfold and find out if your own conclusions are correct.
B000VHXBIU|4.0|I'm not going to give away the last few ending scenes... But they really do make the movie. I was slightly bored until the last 45 minutes but as Robert McKee would say... The ending is everything. I definitely recommend this movie... Though personally I think I enjoyed Fierce Creatures more overall.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|I must admit that I saw the movie first, and I was entertained enough to give the book a try. I am so glad I did, because it is easily one of my favorite books! I love the tongue-in-cheek manner it tells its story, and the way it good-humoredly pokes fun of fairytales. It is incredibly well-written, and every character is beautifully formed. You love each and every one of them, flaws and all. The classic tale of leaving home to find adventures has never been so surprising and fun!
030746363X|5.0|Mr. Ferriss, more than anyone else, makes sense to me! The way he writes is perfect for someone that wants practical, sometimes humorous and always interesting information about things that will positively affect YOU! Ex. When explaining a complex concept like \\"Minimum effective dose\\" he likened it to boiling water. Water boils at 100 degrees, so getting water to 120 degrees doesn't make water boil more! You're just wasting energy at that point. Makes sense right?!? The methods worked beautifully for me and many of my friends... Even if you don't implement ALL of his suggestions!
B0084B5TK8|4.0|I am not one for horror stories, but I loved this book! The story is well-crafted, and I enjoyed the way it uses several points of view to show the reader what is happening. The events are eerie and unsettling, but there is nothing put in there merely for shock value. I would definitely recommend this book!
B004XDYJRU|2.0|Why can't I update to v6.8?

Macklemore has a gift for spittin' lyrics and you will not find a track on this album without a clear message, from shopping on a budget to getting sober to Nikes. My favorite rap album since Eminem's Recovery and I might even put this ahead of it. Check out this cold a$$ honkey, you won't be disappointed.

B005LAIH4A|5.0|Great movie and a Great Price.  Other places still charge $15.00 for the same movie. Thanks for the great move at a great price.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This app works and it works well.  It functions perfectly and the math is correct. My only suggestion is add algebra. Other that this app is perfect!!!!!!!!!!!!

B00AFEXRME|5.0|Who doesn't love Denzel Washington so handsome such a good actor I can watch this for hours LOVE IT !!!!!
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I have always enjoyed the basic Adobe product, and use it on all my computers and tablets. It provides me with the information I need from an Adobe document.
B0000025H6|5.0|this is a real masterpiece, everytime you listen to it you encounter new surprises, it seems like it evolves with time, it never gets old, this recording is a must have.
B004SDEP38|4.0|I found this app worked the best on the Kindle Fire. I mainly use it to read documents. There is not a lot of excess clutter, and it meets my specific need.
B008CJ0KEM|5.0|Love this show , love the characters, Love Trick, I think he might be the best part of the show!, love everything about it!  Waiting impatiently for season 3 to come out on on dvd!
B00846REIS|5.0|A passionate start to a very intense relationship.  Pasts are haunting, creating who you are and who you are not....
B00B1MJ02K|5.0|The first song sets the tone for this whole album one of soft subtle notes with a bubbly effervescence. I really do love this album, Andrea's voice and pronunciation of words are so hearty, yet so delicate. Andrea displays his talent on this album too, speaking Italian, English, and FRENCH!!! It's amazing what this man can do, and his talents  are otherworldly. A key component of this album his how Andrea meshes his voice to the soft, subtle trumpet notes, it is quite amazing. As for the album it is well paced, with not too many ballads, and tugs at your heart while keeping you energized. On a bright blue, sunny day there is nothing better than listening to Tristeza to soak it up.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|The intensity of this fiery love affair is addictive.  Not only are the characters obsessed but the reader becomes consumed by it too.
B00683JK9K|5.0|I am addicted to these puzzles. I really enjoy them when i have some free time. I always use the 216 pc puzzles. I think i have loaded around 150 puzzles in my kindle.<br />I am so glad my sister-in-law told me about them. I do a puzzle while i am on the plane and in the airport
B004QK5N5W|5.0|Very Easy and quick to watch from iPad to TV. Great for traveling. It has quality picture conversion but its not compatible with iPod.
B000FC2KL0|5.0|I chose this rating because this book made me think wow. I have always loved the Red Hot Chili Peppers, I remember when they came out, I was not a super fan but there music always made me stop and listen. I went to my first Chili Peppers concert a few months ago and I was blown away, the music, the energy, soulfulness,the whole vibe was the best experience I have ever had at a concert. When I came across this book I had to read it. I wanted to understand where they came from, or Anthony, got to where he is now. This book did that for me. I understand where and what he has gone through. I have been there myself and with loved ones. I am so happy to read about his sobriety, and really hope it stays that way, for himself, and his family. This book also helped me understand some of the songs, and has made me aware of some new ones. Thank you very much for a great read!!!!!!
B00AB0AR2U|2.0|I didn't really like the connection that it had . It jus keep stopping and that jus gets u out the mood to watch movie .
B00992CF6W|5.0|I  love this app but, no update for kindle I don't know if it's the kindle or you but I still love it, keep the good work
0307346617|4.0|I first heard about this book when Max Brooks himself came to the local college campus to do a \\"professional presentation on zombies.\\" I shelled out $15 and had my mind blown, and the next day argued with students and professors alike on what kind of zombie outbreak was possible, which zombies are the worst to survive (all answers were argued until we all had red faces) and why can't there be an agreement. As soon as I left class I hunted down WWZ and read it in about eight hours. I then went out to get the audiobook version (the rest of my family won't read anything longer than 20 pages) and played it as loud as I could throughout the house during chores. We had neighbors come over just to sit on our porch and listen in. Not long after I let a friend borrow my paperback copy of WWZ and she never gave it back. Thank the stars I had the audiobook, I think I've re-listened to the whole story at least once a year since...I may have to start playing it at work *evil grin* I wonder how engineers would argue over zombies.
B003UBTX7C|5.0|David Baldacci new book &#34;Hell's Corner&#34; continues the Oliver Stone series and it was great!! And to think I thought he was dead after book number 3.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|THIS GAME IS A HIGHLY ADDICTIVE GREAT GAME. I GO ON IT ALL THE TIME JUST TO TRY TO BEAT MY HIGH SCORE, ITS A REALLY AMAZING GAME AND KEEPS YOU INTERESTED.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is cool! It has awesome graphics and cool new upgrades! I love this game! I play this game all the time during in between classes. Its a great way to to keep your mind entertained!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This version is even better than the last! I love the motion and scenery. However, when I use the &quot;Save Me&quot; function, the game often crashes. The game closes and I have to reopen it. Unfortunately, I have to restart my run. It isn't too much of a problem, so I still love the game.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love the Color on this version of the game. The graphics make the game fun more challenging. I also like the big animals and new options. I think if you like temple run you will like version even more. enjoy!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I like your book  thanks this was the best one<br />What is the next movie please make it be the last straw
B0028K3192|2.0|Bottom line-what happened to soul music? Why is no one stepping up to the plate-when we need it most? Holy god-this record is supposed to be quality soul music? Not likely. Is there a single hummable song on here? I just hear weak grooves that go nowhere with a thin whining voice on top. Nothing against Maxwell personally. I wish he-or somebody-would bring the noise. Please. This crowd is awfully easy to please. Very very weak.
B0076DELIG|5.0|The Black Box (A Harry Bosch Novel)another hit for me.all M.C.'s books have been. Ilove the way the relationship with his daughter,grows from book to book. the determined mind set to closing cases//and and story line detail.
0307394549|5.0|I love this book.  Great visuals, clear cut instructions, has a variety of recipes to include some unique and definitely different types of cookies.  Is a great addition to my recipe book collection.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|This is a real quality album. One of the best RHCP albums ever, and one of the great rock albums as well.  The only problem with this album is it is so difficult to choose a favorite song, because they are all so good.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Loved it.  Quite the page turner  characters were very real and loved and hated them at different time.  Absolutely hated the ending.  What was the author thinking?????
B00846REIS|5.0|I love this book! Very good read! I had a hard time putting it down....if you like 50 Shades this is for you!!
B005GVF95O|5.0|Especially my 2 year old. I think this game is perfect for an 18 month old to about the 3 year old range. Once they hit 3 they could proabably move on to more advanced puzzle games. But this is a great intro into the concept of puzzles and making their little gears start turning. My son loves to play games on my phone and this is the one he would always go back to.
1469984202|5.0|Wool Omnibus had me riveted just a few pages in and kept me hooked through the final page. Readers will be grateful that Wool books 1 - 5 are included, because it's one of those types of stories - you just HAVE to know what happens next, and will not want to stop reading as each book concludes.<br /><br />Wool is a dystopian future tale that one could conceivably - terrifyingly!!! - imagine happening to the country one day. The \\"outside\\" (the word alone is taboo) is in ruin, uninhabitable to humans, and society thrives in an underground silo. For generations, citizens accept what they've been told as absolute truth. When a handful of brave individuals begin to ask questions, the façade of a perfectly functioning society starts to crumble.<br /><br />As a reader you want to cheer outloud for the good guys - the survivors, the free thinkers, those with the courage to go against the grain and face the unknown, and curse those in charge with questionable motives who lie to the masses to impose a false sense of security.<br /><br />The only thing left to consider upon conclusion of book 5 is what side would YOU come down on? The safe, status quo? Or the rebellion in pursuit of truth?
B00AEFVRB2|1.0|One of the worst movies I have ever seen, the other bad idea here is that I have to write so many words just to submit a review , HOW  STUPID is that!
B004SKQAJI|5.0|It came when promised, it was reasonably priced, and I have 3 nieces into Irish dancing, one of them toured with Michael Flatley.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|A friend told me to check this show out and I did. It has just about everything in from ailens to psycho killers. Very well written show.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|The second season of this show really took off!  The characters showed their true colors and made us either love or hate them.
B001H4R4LQ|3.0|Since I keep reading it, it must be ok. I haven't finished it yet, but I will.  I find the characters interesting. Our hero spends a lot of time trying to figure himself out, and that can't be a bad thing, for a real human being. Sometimes the story drags a bit. The dragon is possibly the most interesting single character; if she were a human, she'd be awesome for attitude and caring.
6305428352|5.0|I was in tears at the end. What a beautiful story. As a teacher in the arts I could so readily identify with his problems. The whole concept of the arts being the first to go in a budget crisis was very familiar to me and this was very well done.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this product. Its way better than temple run. You should definitly get this app. I was not paid to write thu s review
0525953728|5.0|This type of book reminds us that there are great men - American hero's that protect our freedom and liberty from true evil. While we sleep in, go to BBQs with our family and friends it is refreshing to know that men of this character are down range watching out for us. Loved the book. It is more than just the story of the taking down UBL. It tells the story of how these guys train, deploy and recover from the tolls of being elite warriors. Every American should read this book. Any one who rated this below 3 stars should be ashamed.
B0018OAOQC|5.0|If you are a fan of Volbeat, then this  CD is incredible. If not, then pick this CD up and give Volbeat a chance. A great heavy metal country blues (they are a hard band to put a label too) band of our age. The quality of the case and CD was fairly standard, no issues there.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Love, love, love this album! I listen to at least two songs from this album every day. My only issue was that I didn't get the whole album apparently... but I still give the artist five stars and two big thumbs up!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I have the kindle fire and the app opens up to Imangi screen then sends me back to homescreen every time. This app is a fun game overall but it would be nice if this were fixed.
B0084U0IEG|3.0|Couldn't form an intellectual connection with the plot or an emotional connection with the characters so the book was a bleak, dreary and disappointing read.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|The huntsman is her true love and he sneaks off during her coronation?  When the huntsman brought her back with true love's kiss, I thought this movie might be redeemed - silly me.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|Good for the whole family.  We all enjoyed it and can recommend it as a good movie for the family.
B007ZTLLMK|5.0|Despite the cautions about flying and controlling the helicopter it did not seem to be much of a problem. Very enjoyable to play.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Before I realized how bad it is, I made the mistake of trying to buy credits - the charge went through my account but I didn't get the credits.  The only think I DID get was completely nothing from bingo support!!  It freezes, crashes, and loses your credits, items earned in cities and even your teammates.  Now the facebook version is just like it!
0375869026|5.0|You should read this book.  It is not just for middle school children.  I think everyone should read it at least once.  If you have ever felt left out or bullied or known someone who has, then you may benefit from reading \\"Wonder\\".
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Best series ever! Have watched them all and love them. Excellent quality video with instant download. Would definitely purchase another series.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|This little product saved me from buying additional adapters for the MagSafe 2 power adapter for my new Apple MacBook Pro 13 inch with a retina display. I replaced a 13 inch MacBook Pro with this computer. I was bummed to find out that I needed a new adapter, as I already have a few adapters for home, office, and for travel For my original MacBook Pro. This product works as stated. I don't know why people gave it less than five stars.<br />Highly recommend exclamation, love this little product!!
0393338827|5.0|This is a great book which explains in detail the fall of a greedy nations.  Goes into great detail about the banks and Wall Street and the gross behavior of all concerned in the great debachle.  Why we all lossed so much and how little banks know about what they sell and Wall Street in general.
B009GQ57ES|4.0|Only listened to it a couple times all the way through, but so far so good.  Im always a big fan of socially conscience hip hop and rappers that talk about other stuff than just money, hoes and drugs.  Worth checking out
B0079IEPHA|2.0|Got through the first DVD perfectly...it was great.  Second DVD had a flaw in it and hung up or stalled mid episode and it was hard to continue the episode.  Not really very happy with that outcome.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|so cool. love app. cant stop playing this game. this app is way better than Temple run.vgvgcc gcgcf ycgicugfycfycu vgghtdrtyyuu ggggg ghhhhjjh
B009FZFONO|5.0|This is not the fake type zombie... Great show.<br />Love it<br />Love it<br />Love it<br />Love it<br />Love it L
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|G5 games are up to par with Big Fish.  This game has superb graphics and a good storyline to boot.  I really enjoyed the game,  especially when there were no bugs to deal with.  Keep it up,  G5!!!
B007THA4FI|3.0|It was strange after reading the Harry Potter series, full of fantasy and stuff that you can't even dream about come by with a book by the same author that deals with very normal, very common and very real stuff. At the beginning of the book it took me a long time to actually find a taste for it, sometimes two or 3 days went by without me reading the book (And that normally doesn't happen to me) but right in the middle of the book I started to get more and more interested, I finish it yesterday and now I can't believe there's no more of that book and those characters to read about.<br />It's an entertaining book, from the middle towards the end, about stuff that you normally see in your neighborhood, your town, when you were at school.<br /><br />I liked it.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|Good deal on a great movie to get just the DVD.  Wish I had a blu ray player, but this is still a good enough movie to have the DVD until then.  Definitely recommended!
B005LAIIFS|5.0|I loved the movie, but was a little disappointed I did not get the eggs. The movie was great though.
B008Y1YJZY|5.0|We love this movie, we watched it several times over the Christmas season and I very much look forward to watching it next season!  Packaged well, great deal on all 3 discs.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I downloaded this game for my mom for her Kindle Fire.  She loves it!  She enjoys the challenges on the different levels.
B00AOMR2S2|5.0|I adore this soundtrack and haven't stopped listening since I downloaded it. So awesome! Although I'm not crazy about the last track, but luckily I can just skip it!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Very entertaining.  I downloaded the other 2 books in the series and read them immediately.  Now I want to see the movie to compare.  Wish everything I read was this good.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I bought this for my daughter-in-law. She absolutley loved it! I read the reviews about the discs sometimes scratching while removing them from the sleeves. I told her about that and she carefully took them out of the sleeves and stores them in a CD case. She's had no problem with them at all.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Jetpack Joyride is a great game to play on the kindle fire. It remind me of the i used to play in the 90's.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME. Its one of those games that you cant stop playing. It is very addicting. Except sometimes it is laggy and if you have a kindle you have to force close the app very often.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 2 [Blu-ray] is a great movie. I seen part 1 & i wanted to see how it would end.
B005CAPS0K|3.0|The movie was disquieting.  But I like disquieting.  I like Patrick Wilson too.  It was okay.  Insignificant.  Didn't have an impact on me.
B004UID2LC|4.0|FREEdi YouTube Downloader is a ok app to have for the kindle fire. To me, i would rather go to you tube using the internet on the kindle fire.
B0073Q0IY2|5.0|I like the traditional scary movies that make my heart skip a beat.  This is one of them.  Although, I watched the original Thing.  I don't mind a Thing 2, or 3 or 4.  No dislikes.  Will recommend.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers (Kindle Tablet Edition) is a fun app to have for the kindle fire. I love playing this game.
B006IND5M8|3.0|I like the actors- Harrison and specially Daniel Craig.  The premise of the story was empty for me.  There was no fullfillment.  I like alien movies but this didn't make sense.  I will pass on this.  Embarassed to mention to friends.
B004PAHZMC|4.0|It serves to help keep the pieces together and keeps the messes from occurring from all the pieces that seem to be around when playing with the legos
B0073PZN8O|5.0|First, the characters are pretty.  I like to watch pretty science fiction sort of with attractive actors.  Justin and Amanda are both pretty.  The plot is different and excellent.  &#34;This is a Movie&#34;  Definitely recommend it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Greatv game for kids hand eye cordination. Would recomend to other players.  Great game to play. Keeps u on the edge of your seat.
B0098VYKSA|5.0|I like this kind of movies- fantasy, storybook, simple maiden who is empowered, injustice but wins in the end.  I like pretty actors- Kristen and Charlize.
B001SKB1Y0|5.0|Wonderful acting!  Beautiful scenery!  Interesting to see how the characters developed, and the ending was not happy for everyone involved.
B005UKK4Y2|3.0|I watched it but halfway through I was bored.  I found the story funny though.  But the sense of humor was not for me.  Jennifer is so wonderful to look at.  I will pass on this.
B004UID2LC|1.0|This is the slowest app that I have used and installed, wish I knew what other apps work much better.
B005SAYRA6|5.0|Whew!  The actors are fine.  The movie had a good story.  Simple and friendly.  A lot of car chases, action, explosion and suspense.  A thrill to watch.  Unforgettable.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Sky and Holder are amazing! Great story line and awesome twist. This book is definitely topping out at one of my favorite books of all time.<br /><br />It left me constantly guessing about why Holder was acting the way he was...loved it!
B006SVHOL8|3.0|Obviously the cast of actors were great.  I like seeing them in their artistic nature,  But the quality of the movie was not so good,  I didn't like the camera they used.  The lighting was a problem.  But I was involved.  It bothered me that people were dying and before that had seizures.  It was okay.  Just a blur now.
B004DM0UII|4.0|Great and easy to use radio web app. I gave it a four star rating because of some minor issues.
B00ANW33CM|5.0|I almost did not download because the thought of a 3D majong was a bit scary. Boy am i glad i did. It is the most amazing game. I stayed up last night WAY too late playing cause i couldnt put it down.<br />If you have a good grasp of spacial arrangement it is wonderful. The music is soothing and pleasent to listen to. The animation is clear and crisp. I never had any skips or issues witht he play.<br />I am totally amazed by the math that must have gone into the devolpment of the game as i move around the 3D complex enviroment.<br />I can not say how much i reall love this game.
B007BFSYMS|3.0|This app works great but it needs a few more sound files. It is a nice change from listening to the radio.
B007UK83S4|5.0|An insightful, honest self-appraisal from one of Rocks most intelligent and most endearing characters.<br />Townsend offers great insight into the chaotic world of the famous rock band and the associated public and private high and lows that it brings.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|Loved this Upstairs/Downstairs book.  I knew the shorthand thing was going to be important somehow but would have never figured out how.  I read Secret Keeper first and wanted more so I read The House at Riverton, which I actually enjoyed a bit more and cannot wait until Ms. Morton writes a new one.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I love this book! it was an easy read but one I did not want to finish. I had to make myself finish it due to the tears. The storyline kept me engaged because it is so like real life. A must read for all animal lovers!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|All I have to say is this book is awesome. I just really hope something like this world never happens. I would not want my future generations to be subjected to it.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Season 4, what can you say, the lead keeps flying and the wind keeps a blow'n. Out of sight. love it
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book sucks you in from the beginning and doesn't let go till the end. Hoover writes this story perfectly. The characters are beautifully developed and the twists and turns makes you never want to put down. Loved it. Definitely worth your time.
B000JO9JHW|5.0|Sounds bad to root for a serial killer, but you can't help but love Dexter and his sense of right and wrong.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|But plot line requires one to suspended belief in reality that the tale could take place.  A common problems with Mr. Grishmam's work.  But then I'm a lawyer so maybe I have a different persepective.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Fun game but it gives you limited options for horses. If they took some gem horses and made them coin horses I would play more
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I loved Daria when it aired and I still do. It's real...no artificial flavoring. BUY IT! It's definitely worth it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|works perfectly!!!When I started withen 30minutes it became the best game I played.Now there is an update that is amazing that came out already!<br /><br />  That's all!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the book. I found several pages I bookmarked because I thought the dialogue or prose was witty and worth sharing with others. Though the book was very long, I couldn't wait to pick it up everyday to read it. I thought the writing style was interesting and served the story.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys fantasy. Great book to get lost in for awhile if you enjoy a nice long and satisfying read.<br /><br />ATTN AUTHORS: I am an author. Please DO NOT contact me and ask me to review your book.

B008Y2FRFO|1.0|This game is horribly dumb. No point... nothing to it.. just drop stupid coins. Dont waste your time. Not sure how it is such high stars.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was a very good book.  It was hard to put put down.  Now to start book 2.  Can't wait.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|After latest update I lost all coins(over 65000) & level 29! Everything I unlocked gone! Ridiculous! Wish I didn't have to redo all that I've already done :( fix it where you don't loose data when it updates! Also the screen freezes are frustrating!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|my favorite hour on sunday, look forward to all week long.easy to catch up with the dvds,good price too<br />great show
B0067RQYNW|5.0|I have this app on my Kindle Fire HD. It is the only usable free app I could find  that allows wditing Office apps on the Fire/Android tablet.  I wondered whether I could ever see myself editing on my phone.  I doubt it but better to be safe than sorry. I recommend this highly for Android phones and tablets
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is so fun and very addicting.  I like it a lot better than the original because you get different people and great tasks.
B004DM0UII|3.0|I downloaded this free app onto my Fire HD.  It works well.  But there are better applications for music.  And yes the better app is probablly the one you are thinking of -- ask anyone under the age of 30 something and they weill tell you what it is.
0345529057|5.0|These books came VERY fast! They were wrapped and in great condition when I received it. Its definitely a heavy set of books but I can't wait to dive in!
B0054JZC6E|2.0|I was hooked by being able to download that many time wasters to my Fire for free.  I was disappointed in that there were few that I would even waste my time playing when I wanted to waste time.  I removed it from the cloud.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I play the game every day.it is the best game. I love elf tricky. Thank you for bringing in different cities.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|It's a llittle clinky but you get used to it.  It is ideal for those who take notes that are a little more permanent than reminders on a sticky notes.  You can create different note books for different topics.  It is free.  Try it.
B00B19DMUE|2.0|This movie was not scary at all! Kinda boring actually. And none of it could have possibly happened in real life. I hate when they say \\"Based on true events\\"  when it's totally impossible for any of it to have happened. I wanted to like it so bad but it was just not a good movie. Sorry :o(
B009NPM5Y2|1.0|Cheesy... Lipsync city... poor acting by all but Baldwin.. Cruise has the strangest posture... Just horrible. A shame I wasted time and money on this.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Thrilling and scary flight scene.Denzel gives one of his finest performances in years. Don Cheadle and John Goodman also give memorable performances.Definitely worth watching. If Daniel Day Lewis was not so amazing as Lincoln,Denzel could easily win an Oscar for this film.
044980691X|5.0|I read this book last year and really liked it.  This week went to library looking for an audiobook to listen to while I quilted and chose The Litigators.  Some audiobook readers do just that, read, not Dennis Boutsikaris, he entertains.  You could tell that he too enjoyed the book as he read it with relish and true joy. So I would recommend that even if you have read the book already let Dennis Boutsikaris read it to you.
0698116496|5.0|I received this book in time and my child and I really like everything about it: nice pictures (especially one where verything is black and only eyes are seen), simple texts. A really good book for a 2year old!
1451695195|4.0|I read this book and I'm still thinking about it. I also watched him being interviewed on Oprah. I think it is miraculous that he is alive after being so sick and I think he is being sincere in writing about what he experienced under coma. It must have been an awesome experience for him.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I really like it.  I'm considering buying an upgraded version.  The game is one that makes the try to get high scores exciting.
B00336Y7ZW|5.0|As romantic comedies go, this one is top of the class.  It may have familiar themes but the film has such a talented cast and the story lines all mesh smoothly.  If you want a film that makes you smile and gives you that warm feeling around your heart.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Thrilling, well crafted and tight.  It leaves you craving more. This is the best that television has to offer.  Claire Danes is Emmy worthy.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really like this game it can be challenging at times but I  definitely recommend it to everyone! download it you will like it
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|One of my favorite British dramas. I cannot get enough of it. Had been waiting on Season 3 for like the longest time! :) I highly recommend this.
B0079IEPHA|5.0|How can you go wrong with Harvey and Mike?  Totally in love with this show so my comments are going to biased but I do think this show is a good show and people should definitely take a look
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I don't know specifically what kind of viewing history would predispose an audience to enjoy DA, but I can tell you my entire trash-and-reality-avoidant family was delighted, refreshed and became immediately hooked on this drama. I think the series is intelligently written and stunningly set, authentically based in culture and history, and beautifully decorated and costumed. We've quickly grown to care deeply about the characters and live their lives alongside them vicariously.
B00A1S0ITE|5.0|Great album. Been impressed with this duo since I first heard of them. Ian just keeps getting better and better.
B004RE29PO|5.0|This is a classic movie and holds up very well.  Some other 80s movies in this genre tend to come off cheesy by today's standards, but not here.  Aliens is still a great ride and doesn't constantly remind the viewer that it is 25+ years old.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I saw a recommendation for this book on a friends Facebook page and thought I'd give it a shot so I downloaded it to my kindle.<br /><br />I was hooked straightaway with a shocking prologue that kept me turning the pages. Catherine is central to the storyline, a young woman who'd been so badly abused by an ex-boyfriend, that she developed OCD. The story flits from her past to her present, drawing out just how she became what she was. I don't know how much the author knows about psychological disorders, or domestic violence for that matter, but it was pretty convincing.<br /><br />I only found out later it was Elizabeth Haynes's first book - I hope there's more like this up her sleeve.
0143038419|5.0|I enjoyed the opening up of her mind, heart and soul!  I am also on a quest to be more spiritual!
B007FROGME|5.0|I was recommended this book by a friend. I'd never even heard of this author and not being a big crime fan I wasn't overly enthusiastic.  My friend persuaded me to give it a go and a day and a half later I'd finished it and was already searching for Tom Rob Smith's other books.<br /><br /> An utterly gripping read.
B007FDE4Y8|2.0|I don't think I'll ever understand why these things cost so much, but this was the best deal around I could find. It shipped quickly and worked pretty decently at first. But after only a few days of mild use, the part where the adjustment wheel meets the lower metal bar and its weights started swiveling... Eventually it became impossible to balance and use simultaneously, and it fell off... I had to buy something called JB-Weld (cold welding substance) just to try and fix it. I spent a lot of time repairing this thing... and It kind of works now.<br /><br />I can't help but feel ripped off... But if the product were more sturdy and didn't break, I'd probably have given it four or five stars.
B009R5GR1K|5.0|The dictionary that comes with Kindle Fire is very difficult to use finding a word. This one is a snap to use. Type in a word and the definition is there instantly without all the old English folderot of the Oxford book. Plus it has plenty of other interesting things.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Love this app - got it for my Kindle fire and love that it gives me quick and easy access to the files on my Kindle - If you have a Kindle Fire get this APP!!!!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Awesome series. Now I need season 3 with the Christmas finish!! Just like a good book, I could not stop
B0009P5YXO|4.0|A nice product that does nothing but buzz and glow but that is what it is - it seemed a bit cheaply made and one of the parts keeps popping off but she loves it anyway
B002M5E2DW|5.0|This book is about the law of attraction and if you adhere to it, life will give you what you desire.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|This is the first App I actually paid money for - it works great with my Fire as long as you don't try to use the high resolution setting on it - not sure why they keep it as an option on the app when they know it will most likely cause the Fire to lock up and need to be restarted.
B000FC2KL0|5.0|By far the best musician bio I've ever read. So real, so true. Anthony left nothing out, so true, so raw. I've read many bios over the past year, this was the most enjoyable I have ever read. Really takes you into the world of an addict, and one with means to support it, and goes well over those means and the sadness it brings to those around him. Can't recommend this book enough, even if you aren't a fan of the group.
B0086700CM|5.0|My daughter put this on my kindle and loves to play it - she got hooked on this on her Droid pro but loves to play it on my Fire because the screen is so much bigger
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Cannot wait for the next one to come out!  Amazing how these are still so good after all these years!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have this on my Droid and now on my Fire - I love it for reading my bible - works great and is very easy to use. I have recommended it to several people and will continue to recommend it.
B000E0W24S|5.0|My recent purchase<br />loved the beautiful piano concertos thank you.will definitely purchase something eles in the future.thanking you in advance for future purchases, I am, sincerely, a satisfied customer.
B0053O89RY|5.0|Great prpduct, delivered om time, most happy We have enjoyed it a lot,  A story of a modern american family, Sofia Vergara is quite funny
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Interesting storyline and clever graphics kept my interest up. Only one challenge was not functioning properly. I skipped it after 5 minutes and was still able to compete the game. Good job,  Big Fish!
B002WYH5N2|4.0|Although overall happy with dvd of Pride & Prejudice, I thought there was an extra feature with some deleted scenes.
B005FLX2WC|5.0|Both Beth Hart and Joe B are great on this CD. I love many of the songs...her voice is incredible.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|A very good ending to the  batman movies it also adds the nice twist with robin....maybe they will add another on with robin
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Kearns Goodwin does a superb job of narrating the story of our greatest president's ascendancy to the White House by defeating more powerful (and better known) political rivals.  Lincoln then has the grace, good sense, and--above all--the flair for political management and leadership to be able to form his cabinet by selecting his political opponents as cabinet secretaries.  The product may have been expressly what was required to be able to weather the most trying period of this nation's history.
B000YXMMAE|4.0|This cd came with a paper cover - lame. The music, itself? f***ing awesome. I guess I can't complain too much.
1439102732|5.0|This book was very powerful and emotional! The best yet from Jodi Picoult! An absolute page turner! It is very rare that I find a book that I just can't put down!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|By far the best book I've ever read. I wish there was more of the story to read!!!! Highly recommend this book.
B00B99N4EA|4.0|This book was fabulous! I started reading it because I had heard such great reviews on the movie. The movie was equally phenomenal but surprisingly so much more in depth than the book. I was kind of dissapointed at all of the differences. But the book and movie are both wonderful... but in their own way. The movie was a very loose adaption of this book.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|I bought this album because I saw it for $5 and loved &#34;Closer&#34;.  I have two of their previous albums as well and didn't think that I would like this one as well.  Well, I think I enjoy this one even more.  It's almost like a guilty pleasure because their sound has evolved from what it used to be.  I am really digging it!
1451696191|2.0|I was very dissapointed. Throughout reading the book I just kept waiting for something to happen and it never did. There was never a true climax for me. I just didn't understand the point of the book.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Well, it is Stephen King.  Need I say more?  Being of child of the 60's, I was immediately drawn into the story.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|this app can be used for soooo many different purposes. It's conveince, flexibility, and simplicity  makes it the best text editing app availible.
B007UWBQEU|5.0|Love Carrie and I love this CD! There are so many good songs on here. Every time I listen to it I have a new favorite!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Omg I can't stop playing this since I've got it, I wouldn't really say it's fun it's just enjoyable and you won't be able to stop once you've got the hang of it, never had anything wrong with this app, whoever made this- your a genius, I'd definitely recommend it for anyone especially the temple run fans as this Is a more excitable version... the kids will love it to, I think they'll enjoy collecting coins and getting characters with them, definitely get it ITS FREE :O
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|This movie is pretty good. The plot is over simplistic but if you just take it for entertainment value its always satisfying seeing Bruce Willis get gunned down.
0783240287|5.0|I owned this on VHS but am no longer able to watch due to a faulty player, therefore it was absolutely necessary to replace.  Joseph is one of my all time favorite musicals.
B00HF98SJY|4.0|Sylvester Stallone stars as Philadelphia boxer, Rocky Balboa<br />aka \\"The Italian Stallion\\" in these dramas. I love these films<br />and Rocky is one of Stallone's best roles. This set features<br />all 6 films which have nice picture and sound plus neat extras.<br />The original is the gem because it's remastered. I recommend<br />this good set.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|addicting! I play it everyday only thing that's a dislike is how long it takes to get fully charged with coins again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I was just goofing around and found this, turns out it's my new favorite game. Why not give it a try.
B00785P2QC|5.0|this is a fun game.  it is a good way to pass time.  it kind of reminds me of a more interactive sim city
B000SEGMAU|5.0|What an insight into a terminal illness and how it changes perspective on life! As a nurse, it helped me understand the whole patient and not just the illness
B004CUVRF6|5.0|My daughter loves this film as do I. I just wished I had read more carefully about not being able to download the move onto my android tablet. The upside is that I can download it into my laptop so I don't feel as cheated. I just dont' have a constant internet connection for my daughter to mess with but not Amazon's fault.
B003R50FRI|5.0|I downloaded the sample chapter and fell in love almost instantly. I could not put this book down. A beautiful read with many great quotes.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|I know these events happen in peoples lives however they are better delt with by pros than by fiction writers.
B008ASGP3U|3.0|I did not like the ending ,he could have done a better job otherwise I liked the read. he is one of my favorites
B009ANP4F4|3.0|This was given as a gift. The person liked it very much, and requested it as an option for a gift.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is freaking great. It's not boring or monotonous there is always something to work towards. I like how the settings change and they offer special boards and characters for each new place.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|A fun, simple game for us older folks. You don't have be a wiz kid to play Cubistry. Try it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I would recommend this to everyone. I love the show. Please keep going Downton Abbey. I don't every want it to end.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|My wife and I are really hooked on this series.  The acting is excellent and the plot line always keeps you guessing.  We can hardly wait for the release of season four.
B002PEP4U0|4.0|Really amazing story and quite moving when you realize that this young man made something out of nothing! In the USA we have the best equipment and still want more, in Africa they make workable tools out of trash.
B005UDD1R6|5.0|It works well with my computer network system. Being able to play with all of my movies on one device is priceless.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|After the Great War the extended Crawley family, and the many servants who keep the estate running, must adjust to life and change as society changes.  This is a well-acted, well-crafted drama that illustrates the life stories that affect everyone--rich and poor, aristocrat and working class--without distinction. There are secrets, cunning, manipulations, success, loss, sex, love, politics, a murder conviction...  The weekly show is well paced with a well defined story arc that keeps the 48 minutes flowing. This is not a stuffy or boring period piece.  Make your guy comfortable with a pizza and beer...ok, you can step up the beer...maybe Stella Artois, but hide the sherry until your mom's visiting.  After 1 or 2 shows, he will just have to know what's gonna happen...
B005K17RU0|5.0|Very easy to use and get setup nice to get the local conditions without a lot of advertising, No pop ups or sales pitches just the weather conditions
B005MMYBXI|4.0|I do not have Starz, so I loved the fact that I could purchase instant view and watch this immediately.
0765334798|5.0|This book was not at all what I expected. And that's a good thing. Actually, a great thing. I expected this book to be a satire of sorts about Star Trek: TOS and it was...for a while. The humor is fantastic, and there are a couple of laugh-out-loud moments and some truly funny lines.<br /><br />But then the book turned on a dime and became much more than poking fun at the Star Trek redshirt motif. The book suddenly became about WRITING (and not sci-fi writing, but the creative process in general). It was like reading a sci-fi version of Spike Jonze's Adaptation; clever, introspective, and very honest. It was fantastic.<br /><br />And then the book turned on a dime AGAIN. I know some reviews here didn't care for the Codas, but my goodness, I loved them. They might be my favorite parts of the book, especially the last one -- an incredibly emotional finale that really snuck up on me.
B00280LYHS|5.0|An awesome book!!!!!!! Just as good as the others, wish the series.never ended. One of the bestbseriesninhave ever read. :)
B00005AWMF|5.0|Still the best music, a must to have in your collection. A Perfect selection when having friends over, a dinner party, or cocktails.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|This album has some really catchy songs on it so I'm pretty happy with my purchase. It doesn't hurt that the digital download was a steal.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Lee Child's Jack Reacher series has captured my heart and mind.  There is always action from the first to the last - and never a dull moment.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|One of the few love novels I've ever read and second only to The Pact by Jodi Picoult. Recommended for sure.
B003WUYRGI|4.0|Dear,people thank you very much please you need to get paid for doing this stuff for people thank you!<br />And also thanks for being so nice
B000H1RFKA|4.0|The actress is gret in this DVD,  I have seen he in other movies.  I would purchase more of the movies she is in
B005LAII3A|4.0|Having been a fan of the earlier Arnold Schwarzenegger version I had read enough reviews on this one to prick my curiosity. I watched it last night for the first time and had an enjoyable time doing so. Although it has a very similar basic story line any similarities stop at that point.<br /><br />It is not really fair to try and compare this one with the earlier version as there are just too many differences but this one stands on its own merits very well in my opinion.<br /><br />If you enjoy sci-fi action movies this should be one you'll enjoy, I know I did.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book,as I did The HungerGames, the first in the trilogy.  Although this was originally written and marketed as a book for teenagers, this 70-year-old really enjoyed it.  Lots of action and emotion, with no vulgarity or unnecessary violence or sexual content.
0385342063|5.0|This was a very humorous book which I couldn't put down.  I enjoyed it immensely and laughed out loud through much of it.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|This is one of my first amazon reviews. I had to log in just so I could rate this series a perfect score. It is very addicting and everyone I have recommended it to also seems to love it. The acting is the best I have ever seen on any modern show over the past 20 years.
B005M2V2K8|5.0|I bought this for a Birthday present for a friend who is in to cats and she loves it. It is an adorable kitten and is very warm to look at.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I cannot slow down reading Vince Flynn books.  After finishing his newest books I have to wait an entire year for the release of his next novel.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Great movie, plot twist I wasn't expecting! Bruce Willis and Emily Blunt are great too. Action, and a little romance.
B009LDXQGC|5.0|It's the Greatest Hits album, so it's not like you don't know what you're in for. The new songs are in the same style and give you the same basic message we've been getting for years. Don't expect drastic artistic changes. It's solid, dependable guitar rock.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|I enjoyed the movie and was entertained. Karl Urban has talent but it felt like he was trying to channel his inner Sylvester Stallon. But I was entertained and will not purchase the movie.
1455502758|5.0|Mortality collects the final writings of Christopher Hitchens as he is confronting his own death from esophageal cancer.  It is very sober and reflective book that is painfully honest, grim and unapologetic. As with all of Hitchen's writings, his wit and humor do still come through in Mortality.  If you have ever wondered what it is like to see the whites of death's eyes, this is it.  Most of the book is devoted to his experiences dealing with his disease, treatment and dealings with his friends and caregivers. The last section compiles short bits of unfinished writings during his final days, most likely when he was too weak to complete. While disjointed, they offer some fascinating insight into the author's final thoughts.<br /><br />A friend gave me this book while I was recovering from multiple chemotherapies and a bone marrow transplant. Being a good friend and knowing I was a Hitchen's fan, it was not a risky gift choice. It was funny how many elements and stories were familiar to me and how I found myself flashing back to my old hospital room while reading.<br /><br />It is not a triumphant book; we loose the author by the end. But it paints a vivid portrait of a man dying and stirs all of the emotions that such passages bring with it.<br />Highly recommended.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Quite a few people recommended I read safe haven. I'm glad I did it was beautifully written. With a mix of heartache love and suspense. And what I thought was an excuse me what? Moment st the end I never saw coming. I just hope the movies just as good.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is fun and challenging. Watch out because it takes a lot more than just skill to beat this game.
B00723NWJE|5.0|What else can I say?  She's awesome. Wish there were more albums to buy.  I think I own all of them!
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|if you understand heart as a key component to good music, then this will inspire you.  this is a welcome addition to my collection
B00AREIAI8|5.0|the kids love playing this game. their favorite part is grooming and feeding :) I would definitely recommend this game to anyone.
0060987464|1.0|THIS BOOK IS A WASTE OF TIME. I TRIED TO READ IT BUT IS DID NOT HOLD MY ATTENTION VAEY LONG. DON'T WASTE YOR MONEY ON THIS BOOK.
B00321MGPG|5.0|but some people call them TV shows... i have all of this searies except  2 episodes i got most of them from itunes
B004R13U6Y|5.0|This is the only app I have purchased  for my Kindle fire hd, and I have owned it for over a month.  The reviews for this app were so positive that when I was looking for a PDF reader I had to try it.  I was, like many other reviewers, very disappointed with the PDF reader that came preloaded on the device, so I was happy to see that there was an actual Adobe reader available.  I was quickly disappointed with Adobe reader; many of the features that you get with the free desktop version were just not available forth mobile app - things like read aloud,  a feature I use a lot as a young, busy mom of three.  So, I went ahead and did my research and decided to purchase this EZ Pro Reader - best money I have spent in a long time!  The read aloud feature on this app is truly amazing!  I am glad to see that all my PDFs are available in a list (w/thumbnails!) at the startup screen so I don't have to hunt for them, and there are many great settings that you can tweak to make things customized to the user's liking.  Fantastic!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It's. great the games are super fun,but the games need instructions. Other than. that. it is awesome. Fun for the whole family!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Very touching story told from the dog's point of view. This book made me laugh and cry and feel satisfied at the end.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Really an insight into the hierarchy of servants.  The upper class issues didn't surprise me, but I wasn't that aware of how the servants jockeyed for position.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|An oldie but a good book sorts depressing but I couldn't stop reading glad I picked this one out for sure
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing.  I love the interface and the concept  no lags or anything  pure genius  hope to see more games in the future
B001B7CNY2|4.0|i like submarine movies and this one was good for how short it seemed to be, its so good i guess.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Great read for a gear head.  Make sure to get through the first few chapters so the story branches out beyond his internal journal
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I installed this on my and my wife's new Samsung Galaxy S III (Android) phones and we love it.  All of the CD's that we've ever bought on Amazon were instantly available on our phones, either for streaming (which worked great and saves space on your phone) or downloading for listening when you don't have cell service.  You can also load other music to the cloud and listen to it on your phone.  It's great!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Love all of the Angry Birds games but this one is by far the best. I love how it follows the story of the movie like Angry Birds Rio. Especially love the powers that the characters have that relate to their powers in the movie. Lots of fun!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have become a compulsive Pinterest user. It is also a fun way to hunt for information and learn what others think on the same subject.
0345525558|5.0|If your work has touched the foster child system or homeless and search for answers of why they \\"just don't get a job\\", this is a mindful  rendition of answers.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|There must be a bug in the program, because it will work great for a while...and then when you go to play it, it won't load and go back to the home screen.  It requires a uninstall/reinstall to work again.
B005USZML4|5.0|Thus book was just as good as the last one, and I am ready to the next book! It was good.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I have not been able to get through a book this quick in a long time, it keep my interest the whole way through! Such an intense and beautiful story, I love Nicholas Sparks!
B000E33W1W|5.0|Ghostbusters(1984) needs no introduction. This movie should not be confused with Filmation's 1970's cartoon also called Ghostbusters. One movie critic claimed that Ghostbusters feels like The Exorcist(1973) mixed with a Saturday Night Live skit.<br />The 1986 cartoon The Real Ghostbusters introduced me to the characters. Egon Spengler, Ray Stantz, and Peter Venkman are college professors who start a paranormal control service called Ghostbusters. Winston Zeddmore joins the team as the fourth member. The Ghostbusters have to stop a demigod called Gozer from invading New York. Ray Parker Jr.'s Ghostbusters theme song is good. Elmer Bernstein's music score for the film deserves praise, too. There was a Ghostbusters Nintendo game where one had to earn money to pay for gasoline and traps! In an early draft of Ghostbusters, the story took place in the future. That script would have driven up the budget to $300 million dollars. The special effects in Ghostbusters were top notch in 1984. The footage of the giant Stay Puft Marshmallow Man walking on New York streets looks real! Ghostbusters was a big critical and commercial hit. Teri Garr, John Candy, and George Wendt made cameos in the film's music video. I can remember shopping centers were stocked with toy proton packs. Hi-C released a beverage called Ecto-Cooler. The ABC TV version of Ghostbusters used alternate takes from the movie such as Peter Venkman(Bill Murray) calling Walter Peck \\"some kind of animal\\". Ghostbusters spawned Ghostbusters 2(1989) and a cartoon show that lasted for more than a decade. Fans are hoping for Ghostbusters III.<br />Ghostbusters is a classic horror-comedy.

B0063IH60K|2.0|This game was not what I expected.  I enjoy regular solitare the best, and this game is different.  I'm sure for others it would be fine, just hard to teach an old dog new tricks!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|\\"Hopeless\\" sucked me in from the first page... and held my attention to the last. I am truly torn about having finished this book. It is one that you wish could go on forever. I need to find myself a Holder!
B0006ICHD4|3.0|This motion picture, like most war films is fictitous. The building of a bridge over the river Kwai presented a group of captured British soldiers merrily working on this  project. Notice none of them seem overly concerned that they are p-o-w's. Bill Holden, freshly shaved and tanned does his bit. Not all that good.
B0084TWN9K|5.0|Excellent.  The length of each story is just enough to engage me without becoming a novel.  Yet, by the time a story is finished I wished it had been a novel.
B00A0NOF7G|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was fun to read. The romance was great. It is now one of my favorite books!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a wonderful game ive always wantend to ride a horse and in this game teaches me how to toad care of one.
B005CRQ3RK|4.0|The last straw is a very good book it is better than most of the diary of a wimpy kid books must have been when his pants fell down when he was trying to get Manny's blanket out of the tree. Well I know that he made his neighbors win the Americans funniest family's. And believe me I know I have had bad experiences like that. I'm not going to tell you exactly what happened. I gave this book 4 stars.
1452110581|5.0|This is the funniest  cat book I've ever read.  Bought it for gift but can't bear to part with it!  Since I am an actress, I would love to present readings from it.  The author really has the cat personality nailed!

B008I43DYU|5.0|Great app worked great with my kindle. I have used it alot sence I have put it on my kindle.
B00005NWLO|5.0|I think this is the best Skynyrd album produced. The live concert recording captures the raw energy and rowdy attitude this band is known for. This is the real deal. Must have!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Nelson DeMille never ceases to amaze me with his incredible ability to write about a serious subject but still make you laugh your way through the book.  Another great read!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a very fast paced game that works great on my Kindle Fire.  I love it!  I wish other games were this ingenuitive .  You should try this one.  It is definitely worth the download.  Lots of great play and it was free!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is one incredible series.  I resisted watching it but finally gave in.  I am only sorry that I waited so long!!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The game Is addicting. I fell in love with it but sometimes it freezes and its not just my kindle its on my phone and also in my brothers phone. Also one day I wanted to play it but then I realized all my scores and upgrades were gone I was really mad. But if u like temple run then you will love subway suffer for sure!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The show had me hooked from episode 1 in the 1 st season. I love it you just can't help but watch
B004XDYJRU|5.0|This is the best radio ap in my opinion.  Wherever you go, local radio stations of all kinds are found instantly.  There is an alarm and sleep timer as well.  I use my Kindle for listening to radio and love using this ap to do it
B002CIY8EM|5.0|This is a very interesting point of view. I really enjoyed reading it. There was points that gave me food for thought.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|This is challenging!  It's fun and takes concentration to get better. Great game for mental stimulation and coordination. There are levels as well so you can start simple and get more complicated
B005M61PGA|5.0|Katie did it again.  I love the arrangement of songs from ballads to jazz to upbeat pop.  A mix that anyone would love.  The sound of Katie's voice is so enjoyable.
B00886XQO0|5.0|I own TB X11 and X12 headphones and these are a world better than those.  The sound is the best Ive heard and its nice to sync my Iphone wiith it while playing so I dont miss calls.  I did find it a little difficult to download presets but figure I will eventually figure it out.  Charge lasts for about 8 hrs of play time but can be charged while playing  with included cord.  All together if you have the coin to spare you cant beat these headphones.  If you want to spend less I would go with X11's
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this is a pretty cool game. if you like horses and taking care of them then you will also like this game.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I love this book because I to am a freshman and I can relate so much even if it's 19 years after Charlie's last letter to \\"Dear Friend\\". I love how open these letters are and how Charlie doesn't want to do something that someone might not want.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I've always been frustrated with the small battery icon on my Kindle.  Finding battery status meant delving into device status information, a multi-step process.  This app saves me the trouble and doubt.
B005LAII1C|5.0|This movie is one f the funniest movies I've seen in a long time.  It's one yu can watch over and over again with each time it becoming funnier...
B008AK8FHM|5.0|very good book.enjoyed it. the poem in the book i shaired with others who were going through a hard  time!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|gave a lot of insight about lincoln and was very organized. It provided me with a strong urge to have lots of respect and passion about lincolns career and morals. After the book I think i had more insight about our history and was also entertained which is also very important.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is fantastic I can play on it for hours and its easy to use<br />Before I got my kindle fire I was always stealing my mum's to play on it!!!!
B002FU74Q6|5.0|this book was very influential.  I may not agree with everything mr friedman writes about, but must admit he has a very practical view of capitalism and freedom. He observes many truths which have opened my eyes and I believe made me a more knowledgeable and experienceed person.  I think he is courageous and really admire the man and passion he has. I implore liberals to read this book as objectively as possible. I truly believe your opinions will at least become more mild about conservatives and your leftist attitudes. The man is dedicated to his craft and you should give it a read. It only takes 6 hours to read.
B00A757EFW|2.0|PAC-MAN -LITE- game very difficult to play i might try to master the pac man games when i find the time
B009CPJHY4|4.0|I found this worhtwhile and relaxing, with a few chuckles and some interesting topics.  definitely a chick flick.  Nothing too disturbing.  Kids and most guys would not like it.
B000FC12SM|5.0|This book is an essential read for anyone in a relationship. IIt makes the reactions and response pattterns one sees from their partner suddenly make enough sense  so one can  realize how and when to act and speak more productively..
1451695195|5.0|The book was well written and I found the story to be engaging.  I read the whole thing cover to cover in an afternoon.<br /><br />I also found the arguments made by Alexander to be compelling.  You'll notice that a lot of the skeptical reviewers focus on Alexander's near death experience.  This really does his book a disservice.  The arguments Alexander makes in favor of an external consciousness are not solely based on his near death experience, they are also based on a long standing philosophical debate regarding the nature of consciousness, and on the results of quantum mechanical experiments.<br /><br />While Alexander doesn't specifically mention the term \\"strong emergence,\\" this is a core philosophical argument that Alexander uses to support his position.  Philosophically speaking, it should be impossible for matter to give rise to consciousness if matter itself is not made of consciousness. Philosopher Mark A. Bedau notes, \\"How does an irreducible but supervenient downward causal power arise, since by definition it cannot be due to the aggregation of the micro-level potentialities? Such causal powers would be quite unlike anything within our scientific ken. This not only indicates how they will discomfort reasonable forms of materialism. Their mysteriousness will only heighten the traditional worry that emergence entails illegitimately getting something from nothing.\\"<br /><br />Further, Alexander also points out that QM experiments demonstrate consciousness is necessary in order for a collapse of the wave function to occur (ie. bring matter into a measurable state of existence).  There are no strictly determinist materialist answers to \\"the measurement problem\\" (Google this phrase).  The best science today simply ignores the measurement problem by invoking quantum decoherence.  This problem of quantum measurement has led numerous physicists and scientists to conclude that consciousness is external to the brain.  For if consciousness is necessary to bring matter into a measurable state of existence, it should be impossible for any matter to exist at all if consciousness did not pre-exist matter.
B001ESSJ3M|5.0|It's hard for Tom waits to do wrong. This album is absolutely one of my favorites of his and the hits are bound from start to finish.  If you are a new listener of Mr. Waits then then you will not be disappointed by the pure emotion and captivating album.<br /><br />-Cheers-
1401235417|5.0|Scott Snyder had the nearly impossible task of reinventing the wheel, but he did it! Very compelling story that sucks you in. You should be surprised if you DON'T read it all in one sitting.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This story was one of the best I have read in a long time. I could hardly put it down. It left you wondering, hoping and praying as you turned from page to page. It allowed you to put together just enough of the details to feel in that moment but left just enough information to beg you to keep reading on. Loved it!
0765325950|3.0|I was rather disappointed in this conclusion to the 14 book series of \\"The Wheel of Time.\\" With the death of Robert Jordan, the readers will never know if the ending was as he had originally intended. There is significant character regression of several main characters, though I will not convey any spoilers.  Other main characters are all but forgotten as well as various previous events. The last few pages of the novel were, even, annoying.
B00AA7O6QC|5.0|I loved Expendables 1 so the second one was a must see.. it was worth every purchasing. Could not have asked for anything better.
B00992CF6W|5.0|you have to buy it the best app ever don't think there is something better than this!!!!! also you can play with your friends and it really looks good
B000JQU1VS|3.0|It's on my kindle waiting to be read. I downloaded a ton of free books. I didn't have any issues getting it to my kindle. I have it as a reference book.
B00498TQV8|1.0|If there was a way, I would give it a half of a star or a quarter of a star. It has to be one of the worst movies ( if you want to call it that) that I have ever sat through. I could not see any good reason that someone went to all the trouble to film it. I have to stop now before I...............well I had better just stop. don't bother to watch it, it is just a big waste of time.
B003YL4LW0|3.0|It's on my kindle waiting to be read. I downloaded a ton of free books. I didn't have any issues getting it to my kindle. I have it as a reference book.
B000SP1SH6|3.0|I watch this movie every year with my family on Groundhog Day, kind of a tradition. Love it every time. Unfortunately the quality of the copy that you watch through amazon is almost as bad as a really old VHS tape. The sound was horrible, conversations had to be turned up which made background sounds louder than they should have been. The Muppets Christmas Carol was the same way, worse in the fact that the version they have for rent actually omits an entire musical number. My solution, don't rent or buy any digital versions that happened to have been released pre-DVD era.
B000JML90Y|3.0|It's on my kindle waiting to be read. I downloaded a ton of free books. I didn't have any issues getting it to my kindle. I have it as a reference book.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|Works very well to protect my Kindle and as an aid to reading. Meets my expectations. Sturdy construction and easy to use.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|Flow is such an amazing game and I recommend you buy it. It really helps you focus but all while playing. You'll love it, I guarantee it!
B005974CNA|3.0|portnoy and petrucci put this amazing band together and after a terribly produced and poorly written debut  they dumped the singer domenici,who has a great voice ,but is no james labrie.the follow up effort was everything the debut was not.the team took a hit as mike handed in his walking papers.the petrucci/portnoy magic was and is noticeably missing here.mike mangini is the finest drummer in prog rock today,and his skills shine here.the melodic dreamy passages are clearly missing,and it is hard to listen to.dark clouds /silver linings,and octavarium,scenes from a memory are classics that will keep this band going for a while ,but i think the demise has begun.<br />a horrible album by my once beloved idols of the genre.they are being passed over by the likes of porcupine tree,shadow gallery,lydian sea,and many others.this will never be read as it is so far down the line,but i couldn't listen to it all the way through even after umpteen tries.<br />my bold prediction is within 5-6 years they will have disbanded ,and become solo stars.<br />good night dream theater.........
B003WUYRGI|1.0|I Sam defalco thought the book was really really really really useless because you have to flip throughout the book to find the word
B001I8A76A|5.0|Pink is one of my favorite singers. I am glad she chose to listen to her instincts and do what she wanted to do despite all the ridicule and warnings. She made the right decision. She now sings songs that have purpose, that people can relate to, and that help you get through the trials of life.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Very interesting. Worth the money!! Couldn't put it down! This is definitely a must read! Very mysterious and action packed
B006CQLGXG|5.0|And this is one of them.  Seen so many versions of this but never read the book until the holidays.  It's dark, gothic & heartwarming.  I loved it!!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is probably one of the greatest books I've ever read. So relatable, and makes you feel...well...infinite. a must read.
B00AEFVRB2|4.0|But weird. If you're looking for a movie, where after you watch, you ask yourself, did I like that? then this is the movie for you. Definitely interesting, but super-violent.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is boss it gets closer to the pc version every update like right now it has armour clouds and sand and gravel falls now so really it's worth the $700
B0018LMZOE|5.0|One of the best old groups ever recorded.
0060254920|5.0|I love it, love it, love it!!! My 4 grandsons are now too old for this book, so I will set it aside to read to my great grandson: or possible great granddaughter. I was saddened when I heard Mr. Sendak had passed away ... a great loss!
1423113454|3.0|My grandson liked this book, but not as much as the series of five books including THe Sea of Monsters.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Really creative and creepy, not too hard, spectacular graphics! As anyone who has played a few of the games will know, it's not actually &quot;free&quot; - you have to pay $2.99 once you get to a certain point, to get any further.  But, by then you're hooked!
B005MRXS78|4.0|Considering that this unit only costs $65, it seems to be a reasonable value for the money. Many of the complaints in other reviews centered on the fact that it wouldn't function properly with the added weight of the video camera or SLR. I bought it to mount a Go Pro camera so the 6 ounce weight is not a factor. The panning is a bit jerky by professional standards but once positioned allows you to change the basic camera view within a certain range. The drive mechanism is not precisely made so there is a bit of play in both side to side and up and down movement which will possibly translate into vibrational movement if used on a moving object such as a car or truck. However, the unit functions normally as described without any of the glitches and hang-ups described in other reviews. The remote sensor inside the unit housing turns with the head so it is possible for the head to rotate past the point where line of sight for the remote is lost and it seems as though the unit is unresponsive (other reviews). Walking around to the front of the unit again allows the remote to function normally again. The additional &#34;remote sensor&#34; which plugs into the unit does allow one to point the remote at the remote sensor which powers the rotating head regardless of whether or not the built in sensor is facing you or not.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|No glitches, tons of fun, fast, and easy. I love this game, it's really easy and I love the characters you can play as, such as the ninja. Just like temple run. Great game.
B0034G4P4Y|3.0|The movie didn't exactly get rave reviews or break any box-office records so I wasn't expecting much. I did enjoy the style of the movie and eye candy appeal. It was quite enjoyable but again, nothing to rave about.
B0042MEQVG|5.0|Super fast delivery, and in GREAT shape. There were no gliches, hesitations, fuzzys, or any other problems. A must have for the up and coming young actors portrayed in this film.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I got this for my husband as a gift and he LOVES it. Reads it everyday!! He said he will read it until the end. It's a large book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i love this app I get to take care of my own horse. It exactly feels like I am taking care of my real horse
B00992CF6W|5.0|awesome game! Worth it in the .....nevermind. Just. get. it.<br /> if any one does not get it try are newbs! !!
1469220660|1.0|First of all, yes, I am the idiot that didn't double check the order BEFORE i placed it BUT I received it today to find that I got the &#34;MP3/Audio CD&#34; opened the case to listen to it only to find that the case was absolutely empty!!!!! First I personally accept responsibility for MY mistake in ordering but then to not even get what I unintentionally ordered?! This is ridiculous!
B006OCM0G0|1.0|I started playing with the very cool Halloween edition. I continued to play until recently and have found that TeamLava is very slow to update if they do provide an update for Kindle users. So why I watch all my non kindle neighbors get cool stuff for the holidays. I had to go without. it is too bad as otherwise it is a fun game to play.
B009GQ57ES|4.0|Good selection if your lookin for some new and different music! I like over 70% of the songs. Nice price for digital CDs.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I have a horrible time falling asleep at night. I found this app and decided to give it a try. I can fall asleep easily and stay asleep thanks to this app.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I highly recommend this book. Well written, a good look inside the operations of WWII U.S. bomber crews, German fighter pilots, Nazi fanaticism, and - above all - the good that men can do when they listen to a higher call.
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|Plain and simple the BEST  movie of the year. Ben Affleck has proven himself to be an excellent, sharp and amazing film maker and story teller. He has long been an excellent actor and now shows just how multi-talented he is. He was seriously robbed of a Best Director Nomination by the Academy, but has won every other Award so far out there and still has the equivalent to the French Academy Awards and the Bafta's. Awesome movie, Congratulations Mr Affleck and this awesome cast!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Since I purchased this trilogy (my first Kindle book purchase), I have read the trilogy through twice. I won't be able to say anything new or different about Suzanne Collins' look at the world we're spiraling into. Just know that it's totally worth the read.
B00005JKC3|5.0|Condition was perfect...exactly what I was looking for...transition super fast...thank you much! We had a Hulk themed birthday party and dvd was playing in the background...so thanks again!
B000JQUKKU|5.0|Such a classic tale, and one I'm glad to have finally read for myself. The classics for free on Kindle are my favorite!
B000XXGMRO|3.0|Like the boots but i got a size 9.5 but feels like a 10.5, boot its self is nice I like them but a lil to big for me.
B000VYX8PE|1.0|As a general fan of teen fantasy literature (I love Harry Potter, mostly), I had high hopes for this series. I should not have wasted my time, and instead should have heeded the warning at the beginning of the book: it's just not good.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|When I need it I have it.<br />Love it as long as it's quiet and can be used without WI-FI.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Great game got to keep alert on what's going on.Addictive should get this app well worth playing. Good for all ages when you get into the game you can get very far and high scores.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is the most amazing app.  There is something for everyone, great ideas and instructions for any craft item.  I would recommend it to anyone.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This book was amazing! I loved the ending because it really makes you wonder about the prophecy. I am definitely reading the Red Pyramid
1932100660|5.0|I have studied with Dr. T. Colin Campbell and this book is a great reference guide for me as a holistic nutritionist who promotes plant-based nutrition. If you are looking for the science behind the information in the book then this is for you.
159315724X|3.0|It is a rather dull approach to a basic approach.  there were a couple of examples which were interesting and probably effective
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Engaging and fun read.  Some of the magic has faded but it still shines through.  And like all good serials, they're are plenty more threads to pull at.
B009GEAPYW|4.0|Good animated feature. Can't wait till part 2 is on streaming. Thought Peter Weler did a great job as the voice of Batman.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I absolutley love this game it is so fun! It is really fun and dosen't cost you money! :) :)
B00AAX68HG|4.0|i downloaded this game without knowing anything about it. it soon became my &quot;time waster&quot;of choice. it kept me entertained during a flight delay which makes it worth it's weight in gold.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|It's awesome<br />To know how the Steve Jobs was and what kind of legacy he has left behind is a great read.
B000VX1CF8|4.0|I've been wearing  these shoes, for about 20 years as they are comfortable and rugged enough for NE winter weather while still being &#34;stylish&#34; enough for office wear.<br />I have noticed that the recent (last two pairs) the sizing has gotten a little narrower, primarily in the toe box, than in previous years. Thus if you were to have a wider foot size up a width.
074356619X|5.0|I have enjoyed this purchase, and refer back to it as often as I can.  I would recommend it to anyone.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|An eye opening documentary that tells a part of the story of how the American rock scene evolved post-Woodstock. I've enjoyed so many of these bands that span such a wide array of genres it blows my mind to know that they all recorded in this one location that still let them define their own unique sound. Inspiring and humbling at the same time to know how much work went into this music and the story behind it. Without this studio there would have been so much less music to enjoy as a fan I don't even want to imagine a world where it had never existed or had been let to fail early on. It's making me go back through my library with a new found appreciation of the sound, thanks for teaching me a bit of history I wouldn't have known about otherwise! \m/
B008MG1E4A|4.0|An interesting account of the Bin Laden raid.  I found the first part a little annoying (but then again, I'm not a Navy Seal and do not really think like them) but still interesting to have the background of what I assume is a typical Navy Seal.  The best part by far was the blow-by-blow account of the raid, which takes up probably the second half of the book.  The early parts were certainly necessary background for the terms and understanding of that.  A worthwhile read!
B0083EW97W|5.0|Mayer's songwriting gets better with each album; Favorite cuts include, in order: &#34;Speak for Me&#34;, Walt Grace's Submarine Test, January 1967&#34;, &#34;Queen of California&#34;, &#34;Shadow Days&#34; and the title cut.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|WE enjoyed the entire series very much, it was a very good series. A little disapointed at the happenings at the very end of season three; wish there was yet more to watch. Hope there is a season four.
B004OZZ624|4.0|Some bits were a bit too hard to believe, but casting that aside, it was a captivating film that kept me guessing how it was going to end.  Well done.
B007REV4YI|4.0|I love the newest bond movie Skyfall and can recommend it to all bond fans. The title song from adele is really bond like. You know it when you hear it, even if you have not seen the movie. Check it out too [...]
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|This game was a lot of fun. The only problem I have with it is for about 5 months it hasn't gotten the world 3 update.
B0015AARJI|5.0|The controller is a little bit more expensive than from other producers, but the Sony original is worth the price because of the quality and the compatibility.<br />You can also use it for the older Playstation Systems 1 and 2. Check them out here [...]
B004SOR4H6|5.0|This is an owesome apps I can follow everything I need to know and reminds me everything I need to know.
B003Y5H574|1.0|This dvd will not work. It is unable to work outside of US or Canada due to 'regional restrictions'. It was illegaly sold to me. Also to return teh item it will cost me $15 for postage and packaging is is more than the item what i paid for that doesnt work. Also i cannopt contaxct the seller because there is no details. Very bad buy and i am very upset.
B009AMAGQM|3.0|I saw this movie at a screening today. The movie is mostly fluff and cliches that a lot of us already know. It's like someone went and put too many commercials together and forgot what the underlying plot is supposed to be until the last moment. I<br /><br /> have never read the book, so I'm not sure if the book is quite different or better written or what changes were done to convert it to film.<br /><br />I have heard a lot of people thinking that this is the next \\"Twilight\\" series, but having read the books but not having seen those movies, I can't really attest to whether \\"Beautiful Creatures\\" is better or worse.<br /><br />One thing that I can testify to is that there is one electrifying scene between Jeremy Irons and Emma Thompson that's almost worth watching the entire film for. Emma Thompson gives a superb performance every second she is on screen, sadly, that's not often enough. Then again, her performance is so mesmerizing that had they given her more screen time, you'd have to make it all about her character (which seems a lot more interesting than the love story that's the central plot). Also, her calibre of acting is so much more superior that watching the other actors is too depressing. The only exception to that is Viola Davis' performance, particularly in one scene towards the end where she shows raw emotion that's quite touching.<br /><br />Overall, I'd recommend this film as a Redbox rental, and that's primarily for decent special effects and the aforementioned performance from Thompson.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is a kids review.  This is a great book for kids 7-14. It is very intriguing and is definitely a page flipper. I personally loved them and can't wait for the next book in the series.
B008X9Z37A|5.0|Belkin's case for the Kindle Fire HD 7\\" is lightweight, durable, and enjoyable to touch. The outside is made of good stock faux leather fabric and a felt inside that goes against the screen of your Kindle HD device. The felt part is so soft, you'll want to cuddle with it (it's seriously soft).<br /><br />The case comes in frustration free packaging that's easy to open, making the whole experience enjoyable from the moment you get the package to the moment you felt the inside of the case.<br /><br />I would love it if Belkin made these types of cases for the iPad and cellphones. This case is my favorite for the Kindle Fire HD so far.

B0041QSZJM|3.0|I am wild about Pink Martini and had hoped this would really spice up my holidays this year.<br />There are some fairly good numbers, but others are just mediocre.  This sounds like a mash - up of recording studio rejects.<br />Almost all other PM albums are superb, this one missed the mark.
B001GCUER0|5.0|sister--she loved it! Was an Xmas present and had it shipped directly to her. She worked in an office in the 60s and said she saw some of the behavior portrayed on the show. Got her the first 4 seasons and she went through them in a few weeks.

B001974DG0|5.0|This was the first Dean Koontz book that I ever read.  Hard to believe it was so long ago.  Touching story line, and a sweet twist at the end.
B004J4WLPU|4.0|Wow, is all I can say. This book sucks you in and keeps you entranced. I am disappointed in the ending because I wanted the story to continue.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love being able to keep in touch with my friends and family.  I get updates on my phone, but this give me better access and more options.  Keeps the Facebook addiction in check.
0345803485|1.0|There was no point in finishing this trash. Every page is the same. I flipped ahead 50 pages and it was the same lip-biting, inner-goddess speaking, nonsense as before. I flipped another 50 pages and OMG it's the same. I went to the last chapter for something different and ... the same.<br /><br />And note to author: besides repetitive writing, another thing to watch for are repetitive names. Ana's last name is Steele, love interest with gray eyes is named Grey. Then all the other references to gray and steel before I stopped reading and started flipping. I bet it's much worse. Thank God I know when to run.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I was looking for games to play on my new Kindle Fire HD.  I've only played this one a few time, but it is enjoyable.  Not very challenging.  If you're looking for something simple, this is it.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|There are lots of similarities to the first trilogy, a sort of repetition or in a way Aaron has inherited what Jason left hanging. The plot was good and the acting was interesting, well performed by a very attractive Rachel Weisz and Jeremy Renner. I only hope it does not turn into a big screen soap opera coming to haunt us with cheap plots and cliche scenes. I hope that in one of the next episodes the two super secret agents team together and dismantle this insane organization once and forever. I recommend? Yes I do recommend... I saw it twice in a row myself, so go ahead and enjoy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its realy fun because you get to run and duck and roll while being chased by this guy and his dog. Also I like the choice of all the charecters if you're bord play this game! And don't forget to like my ratings bye!!!!
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|These movies make me feel like I am re-living my tees all over again and those were fun times.I gave four stars to this movie because I don't believe in the perfect story. There is always a glitch and what usually make a story good is how hard it is to find that glitch. Can't tell you what. You have to watch the movie carefully and pay attention to all the characters. However one comment on one super hero I have to point out: Tony Stark, alias Iron-Man. I like his positive attitude, never turn down and always ready with a solution. We all should be like him. Great special effects, as usual, and acting was wonderful. If you're a comic freak like me, go ahead watch it.
B007KAJG3K|1.0|I enjoy movies...I enjoy Robert Downey, Jr...but I was extremely disappointed by this movie...starring Robert Downey, Jr.  From the start, until the time I finally just turned it off, I was assaulted...or insulted...by what has to be the worst film ever made...terrible acting, goofy slow-motion fight scenes with Sherlock thinking ahead through the whole fight while internally muttering what sound like krav-maga moves named after Mother Goose nursery rhymes...  A complete waste of time.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|Interesting plot, a bit hard to understand what's going on in the beginning, but the story clears up when Wills shows up. The Die Hard man has a slightly different role this time but still impressive, and surprising in the finale. It's a good killing time show.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Sorry but anyone who can get &quot;addicted&quot; to a game that gives you only 5 minutes of playing time is coo coo. This game has 60% of its coins fall of the edge, prizes and bonus coins are close behind, so that leaves you with maybe 40% falling in the tray in your favor. Let's not even go into its poor physics, the push bar will physically push coins to what ever angle is to the games advantage, and watch as your prizes or bonus coins have coins slide beneath them as if suspended in air, look any game where they offer you to buy extra coins is going to be skewed so you will get impatient and buy them. This game is a toilet sitter or Dr. Office time waster
B00AA7O22U|3.0|The set of my favorite actors is complete in this movie with the participation of Schwarzenegger, Willis, and Chuck Norris, no wait... Clint and Liam are also my favorites, but who knows, maybe in the next movie.Good come-back of Van Damme who is been absent from the screen in the US for a while. The plot is a simple one. Go in and avenge the dead friend and beat the bad guys in the meantime. Can't comment on acting they are all good, they're all first class professionals. ... Maybe you can add Christian Bale too, but not as Batman, though! What I mean with all this is that I liket this movie and if you have the chance to watched, please do so.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is the best ever so addicting my bro seems to love it to the graphics are great and i  love the cave part!!
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Yes, Yes, please do watch this movie. Acting is good and the plot... a bit too long, but fitting the, dark and super hero, style. The story will capture you so don't forget to get a double size of popcorn. As mentioned in other reviews Christian Bale is on my list of favorites and the rest of the cast performed impeccably..
B003JTHWJQ|4.0|Very well constructed, logical argument for the rational behind religion. Definitely worth the time and effort, as Dawkins' perspective lays out the reasons why there doesn't need to be a God for life to have purpose/meaning.
0515142247|3.0|Fun as a free reader. The author does a nice job of telling a story that makes sense.<br />I enjoyed the book.
145210655X|5.0|I got this book for my ten-year old nephew who is in love with anything Star Wars. At first, he looked at it like he was confused by it. Once he sat down and looked at it more closely, he loved it! He read this for a while and giggled to himself over it! It is nice to get a kid interested when they don't have interest in reading.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|Spectacular! Very intertaining. I can't wait for the next installment! The books place you in the world and you care about the characters.
B005PWPUW6|5.0|This works perfectly with my home theater system and my experience of my media is tons better for it. Also, a few people mention a white noise or other slight audio disturbance from the use of this. I don't experience that at all, so I'm guessing it's relative to your setup. This item comes with a USB power supply and an adapter to make that USB draw power from your house or office's electrical sockets. Not only functional, but versatile as well!
B004HD61KE|5.0|I don't know how he does it.  His books tend to be long, but I read the first page and I want to call in sick to work, cancel plans with friends and finish his book before I leave the house.<br /><br />Rollins mixes science with adventure and mystery to create books that never stop moving - and the weird thing is - I usually learn something from them too.<br /><br />This is another stunner from James Rollins.
B0096DZKZC|1.0|This app does not work with kindle fire.  It continues to say install then download but will not load.  Had to call to get my money back.
B005DOKM9M|1.0|cover was a waist of money was too small for the kindle and i will never buy one again what a jip
B00AREIAI8|4.0|its really cool its like ur really taking care of ur own horse. u get to feed it and enter it in compatitions and everything.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Absolutely a wonderful story about life and how one thing can change the coarse of your life!! It's an absolute wonderful book with a surprising and heart-wrenching twist!!! A must read!!!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Good read. Kept this reader interested. Look forward to finding out if the creep does anything more to the main characters.
B00AYLTMMM|4.0|Movie was had a lot of emotions in it. Parts were funny,sad,and courage all wraped up in one movie. A little to much nudity other than that it was a great movie.
0547564651|4.0|I am a retired teacher and I bought this book and read it.  He makes some good points which I have shared with teachers and students when I sub.  Some of the book is boring as he spends too much time to make a point but the common sense information would be helpful for all educators and parents.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Fun interactive game was a pleasure to play<br />One of the best games I've play in a long time I enjoy playing such a good game and fun puzzles
B001OKGX92|4.0|Great movie to add to your collection if you are a car buff!  Forgot how great of an actor Steve was.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the game so much its so fun I  the security gaurd and the dog I had trouble with it at first but then i got the hang of it. I hope you all love it as much as I do!!!!
B003WUYRGI|3.0|This helped me look up almost all the words I needed.<br />I wish I  could search letters. Thanks a lot
B007J4T2G8|4.0|It was very good I couldn't put it down but I'm really upset about the end. I feel just as sad as her.
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|I loved season one and when I got Season two, first episode..I was totally lost and I it wasn't catching me like the first season..
B003O86FMW|5.0|This second book in the Hunger Games series easily picks up the pace from the first book and keeps the reader engrossed in the action and cheering as the tributes overcome strange and frightful obstacles facing them. New twist and the promise of more thrills and surprises in the next book. Great reading for teens and adults.
B005RUUUAI|4.0|Must watch TV! If you love zombie, you will live this! The character will make you love them or hate them..You will find yourself so involved with this show you will want more of it!
B000L212HW|5.0|Well, ok Amazon says I have to :).  Christian Bale and Matthew McConaughey (bald) and Dragons.  All mixed up in a post-apocalyptic fantasy.  The film has fans and detractors, I'm a fan and very glad to add this to my Blu-Ray collection.
B008133MDK|5.0|Must see! Get it now you will be so involved with the characters you will long for season three to hurry up and get here!
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Enjoyed renting from Amazon -nice and easy to do directly from TV - movie was cute - my  3 yr old loved it
B008COD5OO|3.0|Its just a party movie..Party,laughs,dancing,exploding,short people,fighting,pools...Just another Party movie..That is all..Really nine more words..Now six more words really...Not cool lol
B0081KZ20E|4.0|I liked the author's attention to detail, but I felt that too many off-putting terms, military acronyms and a huge cast of characters to keep track of made it a slow read. May be that Forsyth wrote for the 1960s where thriller books could get away with all that extra detail and fluff. That said, the story was still good enough to finish the book and like the overall novel.
B00355L2TU|4.0|If you live in apartments like I do you may want to tell you neighbors who live under you what you are doing..lots of movement
B000VK99Z6|4.0|Includes all the elements of a great cop action movie, with a double dose of humor, without becoming &#34;too dang silly&#34; or a parody of itself.  Simon Pegg is brilliant.
B009IEXKXI|3.0|Good reading - but  to predictable . Seemed like you knew all would be well in the end. Good space book.
B0055S348W|5.0|So glad I discovered this program. It works perfectly with my HP6500 to print anything I need directly from my S3.
B004DM1ZQY|1.0|I love backgammon. The programmer here decided to make higher level game rolls weighted to the comp ruining an otherwise beautiful app.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Just completed the hunger games trilogy and was pleasantly surprised. They are an easy read and each book was an incredible page turner!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game. It's like Temple Run, but harder. Definite 5  stars. I play this to  hours in the car, it's a lot of fun.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|A richly devised mystery blending high tech with old world values. The love of the written word appeals to those who have entered an age when holding a book is becoming a rarity.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great Grisham.  Already recommended to other friends who have also enjoyed it.  He is finally back to writing like we like him to.
B00012QM8G|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies, it is imposible to watch it and not feel the pain this people went through. History is hard to believe sometimes, but when you watch this you get the feeling of being in the shoes of the ones that suffered. The acting is great.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I enjoy petting the horse and playing with it. I can't have one so this works for me. It is fun competing the horse also. You can also have more then one horse.
0425252868|5.0|Great book.  If moral dilemmas posed by the dichotomy between duty to country and duty to God intrigue you, then this is your book.  Good look at the changing social and economic realities that the german populace had to suffer through as a result of world war two.  Heartwarming in the end.
0786891416|1.0|This book was so bad I was compeled to write a review.  I was soooooo disappointed. The book is Castle. After hearing it mentioned numerous times on the series I couldn't wait to read it.  Meh.  Not good. To me it was an episode of Castle.  Nothing original and the constant ruminations of Nikki Heat got to be tedious. I love the TV show and thought it was such a clever idea to actually have the books out in print.  Now.  Not so much. In my opinion not a lot of time and/or effort went into the books.  It's nothing more than a clever advertising/promotional tactic.  That doesn't gel. 'Cuz the books are......not good. I haven't tried the Derek Storm ones and I will and hope that they're better than the Nikki Heat ones.
B004A8ZWWO|5.0|I purchased this movie not really knowing what it was about, but bought it because of the cast. The movie was graet and the product arrived in excellent condition.
B002QBS9KE|4.0|I lost my replacement tips, so when the one I used finally died I needed more.  This was cheaper and faster than getting them from Plantronics!  I just wish they sold the assortment so I could try the other sizes again...
B009WO7NQO|3.0|I want to say first that I purchased this version for my Kindle Fire, not a Kindle Fire HD (I've not made the upgrade yet)... so the problems I'm experiencing with the game slowing down on me may be because of this. The Amazon page for the game said it would play on my Kindle Fire... but I wonder if since it was designed for the HD if that is why it doesn't perform very well on my Kindle FIre old school edition. lol<br /><br />When I first fired the game up, it played perfectly and continued to do so for several levels. But now it pretty much slows down upon any play through. All slowdown issues aside, this is a brilliant mash up of Angry Birds (both the original game and the Angry Birds Space game) and the Star Wars universe. There are great Star Wars sound effects and music to help solidify the atmosphere and much like the Lego Star Wars games, its a very funny & charming take on things. Seeing your favorite Star Wars characters all \\"Angry Birdified\\" is just great. It is hard not to smile while playing it.<br /><br />I would rate it a star higher if I were not having technical issues with the game. But I would say, if you have the Kindle Fire HD, and you love Star Wars & puzzle games, jump right in!
B009JBZH54|5.0|its a very good pack, the only thing to say is that should have mor extra material, but the movies are perfect!
B009T3AE1Y|1.0|This is by far the worse movie I have ever seen. I can't think of anyone I dislike enough to recommend this to. I suppose I can donate it to the library or something...
B000NTPDSW|3.0|the movies are grat, but the blue pack came broken and its realy a pain in the ass, you paid for something new and it cames broken
B008HT4FUW|5.0|The Set came very fast and enjoyed it immensely so we could get caught up on the episodes.  Great story.
B00129H7VS|5.0|its a perfect pack, perfect series, perfect quality, i realy love it<br />its a perfect pack, perfect series, perfect quality, i realy love it
B000SMWUPS|5.0|Use it all the time and so easy to remove wish i got two. Very easy to clean holds drinks, keys also great little zip pocket
0307165485|5.0|My wife is expecting our first son in a few months.  When I was little I had this book and i have many great memories associated with it.  I can't think of a better way for me to read to him then the same book that I had as a kid.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|I usually love everything John Grisham writes, but I was disappointed in this attempt.  He seemed to just have mailed it in on this one.  In fact, he acknowledges that he did no research for this novel, and it certainly shows.  Skip this one, and hope he puts forth a little more effort in his next book.
0307346617|5.0|In the first few pages this book has separated itself from the mainstream &#34;Zombie&#34; feel. I found the &#34;Reporter&#34; feel of the book refreshing and unique, and not at all tiresome. The attention to detail is also great, and the footnotes throughout make this feel well put together and more like a reference work than fiction. If you are looking for a fresh take on Zombies and tire of condescending tones in books, you will love this. If you are looking for a hack and slash thriller with non-stop action or a run-of-the-mill selection, you may not enjoy this as much.
1582701709|5.0|someone suggested that I read this book. I'm always up for a good read. so I download the ebook. a week later I can say that this book is a godsend. I lost my job 3 weeks ago. I was just getting back to work after 6 weeks off because of surgery. bills were piling up, no jobs were calling me back. I honestly didn't no what my next move would be. so I read the book and it honestly all makes perfect sense. I decided to change my mindset which wasn't really that hard. who wants to stress all day. any who a few days later I get an email from a company I've been applying to for over a year now. they want me to come in for an interview. that right there made me a believer. I got the job. they emailed me no more than 5 minutes after I walked out the door. I've been truly blessed. thank you for this.
B006LSZECO|2.0|YUK.  This book was recommended by a stranger who will NEVER be a friend or be a member of Oprah's book club, because she wouldn't know a bad book if it hit her in the face.  Boring, boring, boring.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|I don't wish to summarise the story as this has been done by other reviewers.<br />I will comment about a few differences in the description of the final stages of the attack seen in the film and that written by the Navy Seal Mark Owen.<br />1 In the initial stage of the attack,the woman in the guard room was shot dead and did not surrender.<br />2.Bin Laden suuffered much more serious injuries than those shown in the film.One side of his head was torn open and his brains had spilled out.In addition when he was still lying on the floor,twitching,he was machine gunned in the chest,tearing his heart.<br />3He was dragged to the helicopter by his feet and put into a body bag later.<br />There was no time for niceties since the Pakistani planes were already on the way in order to intercept.<br />The commando action was very fast and thorough.<br />The prolonged intelligence work preceding the attack may have been boring to some but<br />this was interesting since it portrays \\"realism\\" in good films.<br />Best wishes for an Oscar!.<br />Five stars all the way!.
B00425S1H8|5.0|Product worked well.  I used it with an older OS so I had to use the provided install CD for drivers.  Used it to communicate with a PLC (RS-485).
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|This series really goes over the top as far as torture and just plain brutality to the characters. I like the characters but am finding hard to watch some scenes. I will finish the series but liked the first one much better. And please know, I LOVE horror movies!!
B002QRWJA4|5.0|The music the scene the intensity.  The storyline are all done so well and is so intriguing to watch I suggest this movie to any and everyone I know.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|It was a true story and a great movie and to this date no one has won like that since 1973 plus three time in a row.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like the games but they are more no name games. than most. Although. my kids love this game and play it all the time.
1592407889|5.0|There is much more to this book then the media reports. It's not just a tell-all, it's a sweeping coming of age story. Ms. Parker shares all of the good and bad experiences with her parents, and how they shaped her life. I loved reading about her relationship with her Japanese nanny and her con man father as much as I enjoyed the stories about her famously crusty and flaky mother. An excellent, and even uplifting, read!
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|We purchased several lenova yogas for work and for whatever reason the built-in wireless does not seem to be able to push past 1.5MBps when copying files no matter what network we are on (probably driver related but lenova has not updated their drives since the release). Since the yoga does not have a NIC port, I purchased this to test over USB 3. I plugged it in and 64bit Windows 8 Enterprise discovered it with no issues. No driver installation necessary. I am now able to copy files at 200mbps.<br /><br />One tip, disable wireless when you plug this in or it will try to copy over wireless. Also, if device only has one usb 3 port, you may want to look at a solution that is a usb 3 hub with a NIC port so that you can run the network and other usb 3 devices (such as an external hard drive) at the same time. Amazon carries such devices and I have tested them as well. USB 3 has more than enough throughput to handle multiple devices on a single port.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|fun. is one of those groups that come along and has the potential to become a huge successful band, they have great songs, songwriting and a handsome lead singer, what more could they ask for.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game was a thrilling new take on the old temple run. I am positive you will love it with all of its new additions
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I was captivated from the first 5 minutes in Season 1 and I remain that way. Best show on TV!
B0043RSJ8G|3.0|but this book was a disappointment from page one. Not up to her usual high calibre.<br />Characters not especially likable, story not particularly riveting. Try her other books,<br />this one is not up to her usual standard. I was disappointed.
0765325950|2.0|simply put the caracters felt like pale reflections of the originals and the whole theme of maturing was completely missed
B00683JK9K|1.0|u look and constantly think &quot;that piece CAN'T go there&quot; but the fat piece fits in the narrow hole and it makes no sense. the piece shapes simply do not match up, ur best off sorting the pieces by color then guessing which ones connect.
B0031RAOVY|3.0|I know I'll love it but just been gone & haven't hada chance to view it yet but will by this weekend (Feb 8-10th).
B00899DR40|5.0|I love it! I am now going to have to listen to his previous stuff.  Great job Justin Bieber!  Your muscical talents are awesome.
034580404X|5.0|i don't know what i was expecting, but this series definitely took me by surprise. once you get over the hump of the first 7-8 chapters in the first book, it's nearly impossible to stop reading. i completed the other two books in 2 days.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I liked the book and it took some surprising twists. This type of book is one that I typically read so I think it was written well and the characters were well developed.
B0072V394E|3.0|Spaghetti westerns have a command thread or too and this one had them all.  The main characters efforts were either hurt by the editing or poor writing.  I didn't run it off but left the rooms a few times without regret.
B00867GKIK|3.0|I have been buying lots of 3d Blu-ray movies.  I bought this for 3d and was disappointed. Blu-ray.com gave it a real good 3d rating but I didn't see great effects or great visual depths.  Picture is super clear but not so good  3d effects.  As far as animated videos, I would recommend Paranorman(3d: 5 stars) and Tin Tin(3d: 4 stars.  I wish Amazon would rent 3d movies.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|Animation quality was good and the plot did look at the monster human relationship from the monster side of things.  Animation was good and there was some humor but most was expect-able.  Seen it once, not expecting to watch again.
B00AHXDECG|5.0|He totally gets  the sex on in all his songs, i love this song. Another one to place the repeat button on.
B00947N6UG|5.0|Academy Awarding Winning William Joyce is back. This time for a full length film on a new take if children's heroes.<br />You follow Jack Frost, a newly appointed guardian who must tag up with some familiar faces (Santa Claus, Easter Bunny, Tooth Fairy, and Sandman) to defeat the Boogeyman and finds his own past along the way.<br /><br />Colorful, beautiful, and interesting, this movie is a definite family fun adventure. The animation alone makes it enjoyable.
B00884GR0W|3.0|It's awesome but it did not inspire minecraft it's a lie. The game they used was a cave game. Would rate 5 star if you wouldn't if lied.
B000NA28I4|4.0|glad I waited to buy the dvd and didn't spend $$$ at the theater. there was one hiccup in the viewing but it didn't take away from the watching as many dvds seem to have at least one. better than a  vcr eating a tape

1572816112|4.0|I have a sort of seven point system that I use for evaluating tarot decks.  I don't do readings very often, but I collect tarot decks for the artwork and some reflection, meditation.  The first point is the artwork; style and design, proportions, color.  The artwork is excellent; for someone who appreciates the dark, disturbing, bizarre or surreal, this deck will appeal to them.  It reminds me of Salvador Dali meets Tim Burton.  The second point is modern versus classical.  (It's my opinion that a lot of modern tarot decks with too much of a modern feel, have the tone of video gaming or casino gambling.  I've researched some of these decks, like the Gilded Tarot, and it's not that I think that the artwork is poor, just that it doesn't look fitting for archetypes or icons of the tarot.  It is like giving too much definition to Rorschach ink blots.)  This deck has a modern and surreal feel to it, but the imagery still retains the mystical tone.  About the only thing that is awkward, is that only one Major card (Death) is not labeled.  Third is theme, and the sometimes novelty or gimmicky quality; I don't think this deck comes across as too gimmicky, the theme is well executed overall.  Fourth is space.  (I've seen several reviews from people who appreciate the artist's work but feel that it's too 'busy' or that there is too much stuff crammed into a small space.)  The images fit the cards very well here.  I know that some people like bordered cards and others like borderless cards.  I prefer the bordered images.  Fifth is cutting and pasting, or the technology factor; some modern tarot decks that I've researched (through Amazon reviews, YouTube reviews, sites like Aeclectic Tarot), have the feel of thumbing through a stack of paintings or photographs instead of archetypal images.  I've seen people refer to these decks as 'patchwork decks'.  This, in my opinion, comes across as dry or dull, even if the photographs or paintings themselves may be beautiful.  The DeviantMoon Tarot does make use of photographic clips, but it is executed in a very creative way, the composition is very good.  The sixth point is the quality of the cards; there are no issues with physical quality or card stock.  Lastly, the system and booklet.  It is a typical white booklet and there is not much to say about it; it doesn't matter to me if the system follows the Rider-Waite or any other, just that the images have meaning, and I interpret them as I see fit.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|subway surfer is assembled it is really addictive and is one of my favourite games of all time you get to weave dodge bounce and crash into trains
B008B92U32|5.0|It does a quick job and has some pretty good tools.  It allows you to adjust the faces to match the new ones. One improvement would be skin tone adjustment. But it works very good with Samsung Gallaxy Note Tablet.

B00AYDC3CG|4.0|A bizarre but entertaining animated film. We enjoyed seeing this one. The Tim Burton animation is top notch and the story is appealing as a funny takeoff on the Frankenstein tale. An outsider boy living in a bizarre community brings his dog back from the dead by using a cobbled together lightning capturing collection of flying kites, wires, pulleys, collanders, and elevated platform reminiscent of the laboratory in the Frankenstein films. The dog is endearing, the boy too. A must see.

0670024813|3.0|\\"But you must continue in the things which you have learned ....\\" -- 2 Timothy 3:14 (NKJV)<br /><br />I enjoyed reading The World Until Yesterday because it describes practices in some traditional societies that I was unfamiliar with. Twenty-five of these societies (and much more of the text) are from New Guinea, a place I'm not likely to visit. Geography professor Jared Diamond mostly draws on descriptions and observations by Westerners who spent limited amounts of time with the traditional societies, sometimes expanded by comments from those who remember practices before interaction with today's typical societies occurred. He addresses these topics:<br /><br />1. How friends, enemies, strangers, and traders were viewed ... particularly in terms of geographical boundaries.<br /><br />2. Some ways that small-scale conflicts were resolved.<br /><br />3. A war between related peoples is recounted.<br /><br />4. A contrast is drawn between \\"limited\\" war and international war.<br /><br />5. Child-rearing methods are characterized.<br /><br />6. The role of aged people is related.<br /><br />7. Ways of identifying and responding to signs of danger are detailed.<br /><br />8. The sources of religious sentiments are theorized.<br /><br />9. The advantages of knowing many languages are spelled out.<br /><br />10. The consequences of changing diet and exercise from what traditional societies have practiced.<br /><br />While you don't need to know my views on Professor Diamond's conclusions, I suspect that you will find many of them scanty and others may not sit well with you. While almost everyone will agree that eating lots of salt and sugar and not exercising are bad practices, most everything else is much more controversial. I suspect that the flaw is in book's research design. Professor Diamond probably needed to draw on more perspectives from other scientific disciplines to make his conclusions.<br /><br />Certainly, there's food for thought and discussion here. Just don't rush to judgment ... or to change too many things without more investigation and testing.<br /><br />I do recommend the book for those who would like a better sense of what life has been like for people who lived independently of the global strip mall that seems to be reducing so many differences among people and cultures.n't rush to judgment ... or to change too many things without more investigation and testing.<br /><br />I do recommend the book for those who would like a better sense of what life has been like for people who lived independently of the global strip mall that seems to be reducing so many differences among people and cultures.
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|THE SESSIONS is clearly one of the finest films of the year, if not the young decade. It is a true story based on the life of Mark O'Brien (July 31, 1949 - July 4, 1999), a journalist, poet and advocate for the disabled. Before this film he was the subject of `Breathing Lessons: The Life and Work of Mark O'Brien', which won an Academy Award in 1997. The SESSIONS is based on his essay, \\"On Seeing a Sex Surrogate\\", which appeared in the Sun magazine in 1990.<br /><br />Without ever dipping into self pity Mark O'Brien is played by John Hawkes (in one of the finest performers by an actor is a long time) as a bright, high spirited young man confined to an iron lung at night and completely paralyzed, meaning that his writing and his telephone dialing must be accomplished with the use of a mouth-held wand. Despite his rather hopeless condition Mark concentrates on positive things: he is a 38 year old frustrated virgin who seeks advice from his priest (William H. Macy is a multifaceted, sensitive role) as well as a therapist (Blake Lindsley) who recommend Mark engage a professional sex surrogate/typical soccer mom with a house, a mortgage and a philosopher husband (Adam Arkin) named Cheryl Cohen-Greene (Helen Hunt in an underplayed, beautifully acted role). With the assistance of his changing caregivers - Amanda (Annika Marks), and Vera (Moon Bloodgood) - and his new friend, the disabled Arthrogryposis victim Carmen (Jennifer Kumiyama) and his priest's encouragement and sanction, he begins therapy with Cheryl. Though the therapy is restricted to six sessions, during these delicately and often warmly humorous sessions Mark discovers his body and is able to achieve penetration.  The therapy is a success but in the process Cheryl discovers a soft spot in her heart for Mark and knows when to call the boundaries. But Cheryl has introduced Mark to the pleasures of love and the ever-open Mark learns that there are three women who truly love him - Cheryl, Amanda, and a new acquaintance Susan (Robin Weigert). Mark has succeeded on an extraordinary personal journey to discover the wondrous pleasures that make life worth living.<br /><br />The ensemble cast is flawless, with excellent cameos by Rhea Perlman, Rusty Schwimmer, Ming Lo among others.  The delicately beautiful musical score is by Marco Beltrami.  Much of the success of this extraordinary film is due to the sensitive writing and directing by Ben Lewin. It is a must-own film.

B007EECSFA|5.0|Like the author's previous books, this one was totally engrossing and kept you turning pagers until late at night.  The story took place over a number of years and the chapters veered between one period of time and another in England.<br />Complicated intertwining of characters - you needed to keep a mental list of who was related to whom and who knew whom from which place.  As the story unfolded, more and more unexpected details emerged, causing you to constantly revise your opinion of various characters.  The ending (no spoiler here) was a real surprise.  Can't wait for the next Kate Morton novel.
1592407889|1.0|Having read excerpts from the book... I don't need to buy it and waste my money.  From what I've read, it certainly is perceived to be a \\"poor me\\" childhood retribution syndrome Sachi had with her celebrity mother, Shirley Maclaine. Most of what I read could be anyone's life these days with dysfunctional families minus the celebrity status. Not saying my childhood was bad but I grew up in a home with one of my parents sometimes not being around and also was pulled all over the place doing different things. Mostly though if everyday people wrote a book like this, it would be buried in the avalanche of reading material and never be brought to light. The only reason this garners attention is because of Sachi's mother. Shirley is well.... ok older than me by quite a few years. So this daughter of hers has to be what in her 50-60's? Geez give me a break... what does she need rent?  You would have thought by the time you were this age you would have either have gotten a life or gotten a therapist! This certainly brings up the positive verification for me as to \\"why I chose not to have kids\\" if they were going to do things like this. I also noticed some of the slanderous information being stated in the book. WOW that is going to be a feeding frenzy for the lawyers. My bet is the coverage of the lawyers will be an even better story than this book. I say bypass the book and get something better to read.

B00AFEXRME|4.0|FLIGHT is a film that attracts devotees of Denzel Washington - and for good reason because he gives a convincing performance as a conflicted alcoholic cocaine addict who despite the fact that he wastes most of his life and relationships with his substance abuse, he still is one of the finest pilots in the air. And if that is the reason for watching his overly long attenuated movie then the rewards will be there.<br /><br />The story as written by John Gatins and directed by Robert Zemeckis (Forrest Gump, Back to the Future etc) begins correctly enough with a wasted Whip Whitaker (Denzel Washington) still drunk and drug addled with his flight attendant girlfriend Trina (Nadine Velazquez) interrupted by a telephone call form Whips ex-wife requesting tuition, money for their son. The two snort cocaine to get going from their hangovers and they are off to a flight to Atlanta.  Once aboard Whip's instability is noted by his anxious new co-pilot Ken (Brian Geraghty) but despite poor weather the flight takes off only to crash a bit later: Whip manages to pull it together enough to bring the airplane down in a field losing only six people in the crash (one being Trina).  The rest of the film is an endless diatribe of Whip recovering, getting control of his substance abuse only to repeatedly lose if again, meeting a pretty junkie Nicole (Kelly Reilly in a stand out role) who becomes his lover, meeting a terminal cancer patient Tiki (Charlie E. Schmidt), being counseled by his best friend Charlie (Bruce Greenwood) who brings in a lawyer Hugh (Don Cheadle) to attempt to coverup the fact that the investigation of the crash has shown that Whip was impaired by his excesses. A `resource' Harling Mays (John Goodman) keeps Whip supplied with drugs up to the last moment and it is only at the hearing (finally) that Whip confesses to investigator Ellen (Melissa Leo) that he was indeed drunk during the flight and in turn pays for the guilt with which he has been struggling in his semi-sober moments.<br /><br />The cinematography during the airplane crash is excellent and the supporting cast is very strong, but despite Washington's performance the movie misses on so many levels due to incomplete working through of sidebar plot lines.  The salvation for the film is in the last five minutes of fine acting by Washington, but by that time the audience is very tired of the manner in which a gifted pilot has wasted his (and everyone else's around him) life that clock watching takes over.

B006LSZECO|5.0|I blame Gillian Flynn for writing such an engrossing book that I would up reading it until the wee hours of the morning and had a hard time getting up for work !!  Alternating chapters were in the voices of the husband and the wife and you were caught up in their differing perspectives of events and relationships, constantly questioning your assessment of the couple.  The writing and plot creation were masterful, eerie at times (best to read it with a companion in the house).  The ending was a shocker - totally unexpected - and one which will linger in your mind after you've closed the cover.
B0045HCJRG|5.0|With so many dark, depressing movies around these days-I often recommend this one to friends.  If I want to laugh and feel good about life, this movie always does the trick.<br /><br />Its a bit on the silly side, especially at the beginning-but if you give it a chance it really grows on you.  I really enjoyed Brendan Fraser in \\"Gods & Monsters\\" and here he outdoes himself again.  Great cast, cool sets, and a good message all around.<br /><br />Some cool songs are a part of the film as well and you will want the soundtrack!<br /><br />Not to be missed...
B009JBZH54|5.0|The view Chris Nolan has in creating this film is amazing. I grew up watching Adam West, then later, Michael Keaton playing Batman, I never ever expecting such a grand, dark view of Bruce Wayne as Nolan paints.

B005MJDJQQ|5.0|Lets be frank. I'm a big fan of the Kurt Wallander series and rate it at the top when it comes to mysteries. This story is simply another in a reasonably long line of successful offerings from Mr. Mankell and is a worthy read for existing fans or those who like cerebral mysteries and haven't yet had the pleasure of making Mr. Wallander's acquaintance. Those in the know will read this automatically so who cares what the story is about. There's not a bad book in the bunch.

B007REV4T8|3.0|I have been continually amazed by how much others seem to love SKYFALL. No doubt, it was very well marketed. I will concede that it is an exciting, entertaining action film with some incredible visuals and action sequences, but I do not think that it is really a very good film, and certainly not among the best Bond films that I have seen. To be fair, this is hardly the only 2012 film that struck me as a case of eye-candy coming at the expense of a well-written story and screenplay. From my perspective, anyway, there is just not much of a coherent story going on here. It aims to get deep into the character of Bond and then end on an intensely personal, epic high note, but without a truly substantive, logical foundation to work off of, the whole thing comes across as a bit forced and contrived, however it may captivate the senses.<br /><br />The cinematography is great, and I love the Adele theme song. I like Daniel Craig as Bond, and for the most part the rest of the cast as well. (Although the female lead, whatever her name is (not M, not Eve), is pretty disposable.) There are several good conceptual ideas in the mix, but the execution of said ideas does not really come together effectively for me. It feels like a bunch of incredible set pieces that were decided, with the connective tissue linking them only bothered with as an afterthought.<br /><br />I was tremendously impressed with CASINO ROYALE. QUANTUM OF SOLACE felt more like an average, unpretentious action film; nothing all that great, but fine for entertainment. SKYFALL also strikes me as a decent action film, but a very pretentious one that does not live up to its own hype. Hence, I did not like it as much as QUANTUM, and will probably continue to shudder every time someone tells me how much the loved it. But such is life.

This book is based on real people who in the 15th century a Shogun and English Pilot who changed Japan with changes that survived to the 19th century. Read it and enjoy.

1439152802|5.0|Rural England, summer of 1961.<br />Sixteen year old Laurel Nicolson was hiding in her tree house, happily daydreaming about becoming an actress, when she caught sight of a stranger approaching the family farmhouse and talking to her mother as if he knew her. What her innocent eyes had to witness right after that scene was a terrible crime. Her lovely, nearly perfect mother killed that man: as Dorothy Nicolson explained to the police afterward, she was simply trying to defend herself and her toddler son from the violent attack of an intruder, but Laurel saw exactly what happened. Dorothy seemed to be  frightened by the man, but she apparently knew him.<br /><br />She had been too young then to question her mother's behavior and understand how a sweet woman like Dorothy Nicolson could bring herself to commit such a crime. Little did Laurel know that her mother harbored a secret and that the man she killed was threatening to bring her past back home to haunt her.<br /><br />Fifty years later, Laurel is a successful actress, but the sense of restlessness that followed the tragic events of that summer never abandoned her. A family gathering to celebrate her mother's ninetieth birthday will become the occasion for the actress to finally find the answers to questions that had been haunting her family for decades.  \\"Deception\\" may be her profession, but as the only witness of that shocking crime, Laurel feels a pressing need to fully abide by the truth, even if that means picking at the delicate threads of a family tapestry that her mother had struggled to preserve intact. Laurel will dig into Dorothy's past to uncover the truth and what she will find behind the painted veil of her mother's picture-perfect life will be heart-wrenching beyond words.<br /><br />Engrossing doesn't even start to describe the quality of this sophisticated historical novel by New York Times best selling author Kate Morton. The writing technique, with its frequent chronological shifts between 1961 Suffolk, 1941 London bombings and present day, matches the emotional intensity of this well-crafted storyline: the Australian author wove an unforgettable canvas of secrets, deception and regrets, tense love stories, forged friendships and dysfunctional relationships, under the deforming lense of war memories, hiding a trail of clues behind rich and evocative descriptions of a time in history that changed things and people in its overwhelming tide of death and grief.<br /><br />Despite the overall lengthiness and sometimes painstakingly accurate narrative style, I enjoyed this memorable and fascinating tale of love and deception. The Secret Keeper definitely features all the timeless qualities of a masterpiece.<br />Rating: 4.5 stars Originally posted on Mina's Bookshelf1 Suffolk, 1941 London bombings and present day, matches the emotional intensity of this well-crafted storyline: the Australian author wove an unforgettable canvas of secrets, deception and regrets, tense love stories, forged friendships and dysfunctional relationships, under the deforming lense of war memories, hiding a trail of clues behind rich and evocative descriptions of a time in history that changed things and people in its overwhelming tide of death and grief.<br /><br />Despite the overall lengthiness and sometimes painstakingly accurate narrative style, I enjoyed this memorable and fascinating tale of love and deception.

It's like having a wise friend who gives you exactly the right advice.

For myself, an avid New Age reader for 30+ years, I found this to be probably THE most helpful book ever.  I recommend it for people who want to better themselves.

Simple. Versatile. Thesaurus. Fast.

B0019IB0II|5.0|For a neuroanatomist to have a stroke and then be able to describe what it was like, is the most amazing thing.  She was unique in that she had the language and the understanding of how the brain works so she could understand and then describe what had happened.  The title is perfect, because this story gives so much insight into what the stroke survivor feels.  Not every stroke situation will be the same, of course.  But it is enlightening to hear how she felt from &#34;inside&#34; when she could think but not communicate her thoughts, and how the various caregivers treated her.  One of the most thought-provoking books I have read.

B005LAIHY0|5.0|Right on time, perfect packaging, no scratches. Great product and met all of my satisfactory requirements. Highly recommend purchasing this item!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|It was as good as Bared. looking forward to the next one coming in May. Looking forward to more Sylvia Day books.
B005BGBP3Y|5.0|I could watch it over and over. Perfect mix of comedy & romance. I literally want to marry John Krasinski's character.
B0072O8G44|5.0|Orin (through Sanjaya) has a way of telling me exactly what I need to know.  I recommend this book and the others in this series (Spiritual Growth, Living with Joy) to anyone interested in bettering themselves.<br /><br />When I was in so much emotional pain, I picked up &#34;Spiritual Growth&#34; and seemed to just open to a page and see something exactly relevant to what I was going through.  These books truly do seem the most enlightened of any I have come across.  I downloaded them to Kindle as well as buying hard copies because I want to be able to just pick one up and open it and see what my eye falls on.  It has been just amazing for me.  (Regarding the whole &#34;channeling&#34; aspect - I don't care whether that is treal or not, I have no way to prove or disprove, and it doesn't matter to me.  If I read something that enlightens and helps me, I don't really care whether it was &#34;channeled from a higher entity&#34; or from a writer's mind.)
B004UJAOLM|5.0|I remember reading this many years ago and it is still a good read. I feel very sad when I talk to the younger generation and they don't know what I'm talking about if I say I'm reading &#34;Wuthering Heights&#34;. They've never heard of the Bronte sisters or Louisa May Alcott. It's a shame.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|There was just the right amount of will they-won't they throughout the book.  The author really weaved the story and let it play out in a nice steady pace.  It almost feels like you are living out this story yourself.  You go through the motions with Abby, the author really sucked you into the story.<br /><br />I fell in love with this book! I could not put it down and read it within a day. I am reading it again and it's just as addictive as the first time I read it.  Don't forget to check out Walking Disaster, it's this story from Travis's perspective.
1439102430|3.0|Tempe gets a call to a apartment, where an infant in stashed in a vanity under the sink, soon they find two more. The mother Anna is missing and soon Tempe and Ryan find themselves going further north.<br />Word on the street is Anna was a hooker, and a simple person. What is the truth?<br />When Ryan and Tempe start uncovering things it is much deeper.<br /><br />What i liked was the pace and the fun that is in all the Temperance books, what I did not like was the anger and fussing between her and Ryan and a old flame.<br />That got old fast. Where is the romance!!!??<br />and yeah, I agree with another reader, Tempe has to be rescued AGAIN!!!<br />Bring back the total suspense we used to have....<br />These are getting like the Stephanie Plum books, predictable and boooooring.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Yes it'll take some getting used to but once you do, it is soooooo addicting. Better graphics, awesome new power up features and obstacles. This is truly the upgrade Temple Run needed. My wife isn't a fan of video games and such but she is just as hooked. We try to outrun each other (lol)<br /><br />Get it NOW!
B0091THRCU|5.0|can hold at least 4 cards along. It has holes in the bottom to allow you to hear phone calls or text messages. the pull tab is fun to play with.
B00199B2Z8|5.0|Bill Bryson cracks me up.  A friend sent me this book and I have never laughed out loud so hard.  A funny, funny writer.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I feel like this book was just kind of a repeat of the first one, just with some different twists.  It's still entertaining, and I would definitely recommend reading it because the 3rd book in the series in the best in my opinion, and you really need to read this before you read that one.
B000002L9M|5.0|This is one of the best albums I've ever owned--Depeche Mode at it's absolute finest in my opinion.  I was a huge fan in the 80's (when I actually owned the vinyl version) and I am still a huge fan even almost 30 years later.  I purchased this CD back in the 90's and somewhere along the way, I lost the CD (or maybe someone stole it--it's THAT good-- who knows?).  Anyways, I uploaded the mp3 version of the album and was so very excited.  Every song filled my head with the music and memories from my teenage years.  I was thrilled (I know that probably sounds stupid, but music is a big part of my life). Then it was time for \\"A question of time\\", one of my very favorite songs, and it was . . . . different.  It was NOT the song that was on my original album and my CD from the 90's--quicker, more frantic and just missing the echo-filled haunting style of the one I had loved so much.  I was very disappointed.  I've searched high and low on downloadable versions, and none of them are the same as the one I remember.  If anyone knows the version I am speaking of, please reply to my post and let me know.<br />Overall, it is still a fantastic album and I don't regret buying it at all!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|My family and I love this movie. I think my sister watched it two times the day we received it in the mail.
B00A7C9EVM|4.0|The classic books from Frank Herbert in one bundle, instead of dragging pounds of paper with you, have it all on your Kindle.<br />I give it 4 instead of 5 stars because of all the misspelled words (tme instead of the, for example).
B001NLL0RW|5.0|Another great book.  In most of Rollins books there is a point where you know if you read one more paragraph you will be up until the book ends.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Robert Kirkman has created a fantastic universe that is growing with each new chapter. Tony Moore has done a good job perfecting the artwork as well.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|All of the books in this series were great, but this one was probably my favorite (although the first one is a close too)
B004NNUZ5K|5.0|Great stuff! item was just as described by vendor and works just as it should would un questionably buy again!
B00B49L7JY|5.0|I'd give it ten Stars if it were only possible! I consider this to be a &#34;must see&#34; movie Indeed!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have trouble opening this app sometimes but other than that it is a totally awesome game.  I LOVE HORSES!!!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This is one of the best books I've picked up in ages. If you like Sci fi, grab it!<br />Make sure you have at least a whole day free though!
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Nicholas Sparks book are all great!! I'm half way through the book and I hate that I have to put it down. Every chance I get I read a page or two while doing other things. This book is a must for readers that like Nicholas Sparks.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Could have been a bit more well written, but the book was very entertaining and kept me reading.  Be prepared to blush!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Great stuff! item was just as described by vendor and works just as it should would un questionably buy again!
B0086700CM|5.0|Fun game and very addictive. A great game to occupy the time during my everyday commute. I highly recomend it.
B004UID2LC|1.0|I useing my friend but my kindle died and was full of bug. don't get it if you want to still use what ever your getting this app on.
B004ZG5EYC|5.0|I had seen the movie a couple of times in the past and loved it. I ordered the blue-ray disc to show the movie to my spouse that hadn't ever seen it. Well, even if I knew already the story, the characters, the places, and even remembered passages of the dialogues, watching it again was a great delight. The unusual Amelie is a beautiful story of diversity. Strongly recommended for those who praise diversity and freedom - and, maybe, a lesson for those who don't!
B007V2UGPE|3.0|this game will require you pay later on just get Army of Darkness Defense it doesn't require gold but is almost the same game as this
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very entertaining and pretty well written.  Don't worry if you've already seen the movie, there are a lot of details in here that the movie wasn't able to cover and I almost preferred reading the book to seeing the movie (although the movie was pretty good too)
1606863622|3.0|I liked most of this book. However, am I the only one that did not like his love interest? I was so glad he finally stood up to her at the end. Am I the only one who feels this way? John deserved better than her.<br /><br />I thought he had changed and grown by the end of the book. Savannah, I am not so sure. I also loved the parts with John's dad. Which really did contribute to John's personal growth in a way that his relationship with Savannah did not.<br /><br />Its a quick and pleasurable read which is a very good thing.
B004QK5N5W|5.0|It was great. I purchased it because of streaming a show from my IPad.  The only problem is that I have Times Werner Cable an they won't allow streaming.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game was a great deal of fun. I felt it was worth the money. Looking forward to finding more games like it!
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|I don’t normally like time and space traveling – it gets to confusing, sometimes  down right dumb. But Looper  is well balanced in this. The writers could have made a convoluted ending to give a feel good resolve, but rather gave it a loop stop. Oh yes - action.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|The music is super and we lived every minute if it....  worth buying if you love this play. Excellent. Love it
B003JTHXOK|4.0|A god love story which kept me reading because I was scared for Katie and needed to know that she would come out of it OK and it ended with a happy ending.  I love Nicholas Sparks stories as a whole.
B0041KKYGU|5.0|Nice irony.  Most school teachers I know hate it because it portrays the extreme of this noble profession.  This portrays how one person's own personal interests and desires take priority over professional responsibilities.  Nicely done.  Funny.  You will probably laugh, or get very, very angry.......
B0011UJMK2|5.0|Great book. Immerses you back into the cold war and what it would be like to solve a murder with no help from modern day authorities, while you are the authority. Gripping!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|she is the best<br />she is soulful and the lyrics are well done<br />I have really enjoyed listening to her!
B008HT4FUW|5.0|I bought this for my wife. She loves the series and the resolution is great on our flat screen 65&#34; TV.
1451695195|4.0|Read in one sitting; God bless the good Doctor for having the guts to write this book in the face of what medical people believe about Heaven.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I have recently started watching Downton Abbey. It is a glimpse into the past with excellent acting. We get to see how people<br />react to a new device, the telephone and a changing time during and after World War 1.  The clothes in this series are beautiful and it is interesting to see how important manners were at that time.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|And what a chic book!  Men reading the book should concentrate on the author's descriptions.  This demonstrates clearly how women feel about words and how they process them.  Most men would think there are just too many unnecessary words used here and the book should only be about 1/4 as long.  That is the \\"key\\".  All those additional words make this a very pleasurable feminine journey.  [...]
B008CPZNL6|5.0|I love this app! I can open this app and in one place I can check Facebook and Twitter as well as having an overall coverage of news stories, as well as all of my interests such as science, crafts, music, etc. I highly recommend getting this app.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really enjoyed the twists and turns of this book!  Overall, I would highly recommend it.  I couldn't put it down towards the end:)
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was my first Nicholas Sparks book. I will be reading more!!! I loved it.  It made you cry and laugh and made you mad!!!
B009X01ELC|2.0|I've used the case for three months successfully but now having difficulty keeping it clipped in.  I am very disappointed.
B006Z9SP3E|3.0|As with Chronicles 1 I enjoyed the book but did find it easier to put down that with the Chronicles 1 book.  Again, I would consider that Archer has written better, more exciting books.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It does everything it should. Easy to change modes. exceptional for a free offer. It is worth downloading at once
B002PEP4SC|4.0|I loved the book. Good pace and always a challenge to figure out who done it. Also love the wit and humor.
B0083GQKQG|5.0|This movie is one that you'll be thinking about for days after watching it. Incredible acting. Shocking subject matter handled in a sensitive manner.
B0085KGHI6|2.0|I'm a fan of both Muddy Waters and The Stones but as I suspected when I first saw this DVD here, the two groups together didn't exactly hit it off. To me, the Stones were clearly out of their environment as they tried to be blues guys. Sure, anyone can play the blues but only a few (like Muddy Waters) were/are exceptionally good doing it.<br /><br />  What baffles me as why there aren't any good DVDs of Muddy and Johnny Winter as those 2 were great together in the mid-late 70s.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Part 1 was good but part 2 was even better.  I would definitely watch it all over again.  Can't wait for part 3.
B004ZBFRTY|5.0|One of my favorite movies. The SD is true to form while the Blu-Ray looks great. Includes a special features disc that is essentially identical to what the special edition of the movie supplies. Would highly recommend to anyone.
B004XIZK5K|5.0|I already have this in paperback.  It's mandatory for any stage of Kettlebell training, and it's great to have it accessible on the ipad now.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|I like aviation and appreciated Whips ability to evaluate a situation under extream pressure!!  His biggest achivement was evaluating himself.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|while playing this game I soon found myself in a relaxed meditative state.  a fun yet relaxing way to spend your time which you will loose track of quickly.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am addicted to this show!!! I have never watched any type of series that most others talk about (Twilight, glee, etc) but someone told me about it and I thought I would try...well needless to say I can't get enough of it!!! My poor family knows not to disturb me when I'm sitting with my computer and box of tissues and mascara running down my face...I will sit and watch show after show sometimes until 2am and walk into work looking like I have seen better days...I can't wait until season 4 and I hope to be able to purchase all episodes at once...I'm even dreaming about the show...fantastic actors, setting, etc...
0765325950|5.0|In the spirit of Robert Jordan, his fabulous series comes to a conclusion.  Great way to tie together all the various threads.  Wonderful twist - read it and see!
B008HK3XU4|5.0|The Marware Vibe Standing case for my Kindle is the perfect protection for my device - it is attractive as well.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|A very good book. Historical correct, yet with a wonderful story and caracters I would like to follow in more books
055277832X|1.0|They just renamed confessions if a shopohilic! Such disingenuous marketing if you ask me! Shame On you, for trying to trick people into thinking there is a new \\"shopaholic\\" book!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The trilogy is awesome! I couldn´t stop reading! And all the three books are excellent, the story only gets better as you read! I recomend to all ages!
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|I had heard great things about the quality of this Blu-ray transfer, so I decided to buy it when I saw it on sale.  I had only seen the movie once, but the purchase was definitely worth it.<br /><br />The cinematography is fantastic in this movie, which lends itself quite well to the hi def format.  It's amazing how many dynamic shots there are in the desert, and the amount of sweeping wide shots don't disappoint.<br /><br />One of the best transfers available on Blu-ray, video wise.  I don't know much about sound transfers, but it seems like maybe it's a tad muffled in spots, which could be because the source is somewhat old and can't be cleaned up, but the sound is by no means bad.<br /><br />If you like this movie, the Blu-Ray is completely worth it.
B00AVASSZ8|5.0|This is the first time I've heard of Jose James, thoroughly impressed!! I would recommend this to anyone interested in great soul music.
B00005RFAI|5.0|So I came to the Pink collective later in life at the age of 44 first getting into one of her later releases I'm Not Dead. Once realizing she had deeper talent than her biggest breakout hit Get The  Party Started I then proceeded to get her other releases like Can't Take Me Home Try This and Missundaztood. So many other fans raved and raved about Missundaztood. I really hadn't given it a fair listen until recently and I totally get why other fans love this album. Yes Get The Party Started is on it but man does this very young girl share such brutal honesty and maturity in so many of the tracks here. It's far from all fun and games. She took a huge risk to be true to herself and to move away from the R&B style of Can't Take Me Home. Even record label exec L.A. Reid didn't think it would be a wise thing to do. Then Missundaztood showed everyone just how talented Pink was. Linda Perry gets alot of credit in helping Pink create this album. She was Pink's idol and muse and she helped Pink reach deep down inside to write some powerful songs. After giving this album more of my attention in comparison to some of Pink's more recent albums I can join the ranks of her loyal fans in saying Missundaztood is one of her very best albums...EVER.<br />She continues to give so much of herself honestly and bravely. She is an incredible artist and a strong role model to women of any age. Truly.<br />I had been the one who \\"missunderstood\\" what all the fuss about this album was about. I stand corrected and am even more in awe of her.<br />If you have only heard the better known tracks of this album - the ones that get more airplay do yourself a favor and listen to tracks like Eventually and Dear Diary and one of the most  honest songs ever - Family Portrait. And realize how young she was when she wrote them. She has given of herself from personal events of her life in a beautiful painful honest way. More real and unflinching than most any other musical artist ever has.<br />And she continues to keep it real.inues to keep it real.
B007Q0OUKS|5.0|He can play with these for hours, whether it's the Hobbit or Star Wars or any other Legos, they're very good.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|No Easy Day is an intense and well written accounting of the raid to eliminate OBL.  Although controversial according to military ethics, given the impact OBL has had on all our lives, I am glad \\"Owen\\" had the guts to go against the grain and write it.  I do not feel there was information that compromises security or military.<br /><br />It should be required reading for all you people in high school so they understand the impact and sacrifices taking place today in American society.<br /><br />Thank you for writing it and for your service.  I am able to sit and write my opinion as a free American because of it.
0446572993|5.0|David Baldacci's books are always a thrill to read and always the kind of book you can't put down until you've finished it.<br />Highly recommend Baldacci.....he puts some of the other writers in his genre to shame.  I own everyone of his books and often give additional copies as gifts to friends and family.  His first book, turned into a movie w/ Clint Eastwood and Gene Hackman, got me hooked.  I would love to see more of Baldacci's work made into movies.  Baldacci is a MASTER STORY TELLER!!!!
B00683JK9K|5.0|I will add additional star if someone can tell me how to save unfinished puzzle to complete later. This is a fantastic game.The music keeps me calm and better able to concentrate on what I'm doing.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|Has many games.  A lot to do daily to earn points. It takes a while to unlock games. But it helps pass time away.
0060527986|5.0|This book is almost like a daily table calender; it gives you short descriptions on how to live as a \\"warrior of the light\\" would live. You will find lots of inspiration within this book, along with suggestions on how to look at life a little differently. This book doesn't contain any stories, but instead short lessons that Mr. Coelho has learned throughout his life and travels. This is one of my favorites whenever I need a pick-me-up!
B001N1DPDE|5.0|The knife does everything you need it to. For the price there is nothing better out there. If you are thinking about getting it stop and just buy it! You will not be disappointed.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This is a great way to keep your mind sharp! It also calms my nerves.<br />I highly recommend it. get it now!
0345803485|5.0|I had heard all the hype but WOW it was good... I didnt know what I was getting into but I loved it.. part two is on its way to me as i type this..
B00B2V66VS|4.0|i realy like the game its self but now when i go to open it, it doesnt work it just sends me back to the home screan
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I have read every Tom Clancy novel in the Jack Ryan series, and each new one gets better than the last.  This novel, Threat Vector, is a must read novel.  I eargerly await Clancy's next Jack Ryan novel.
0061122416|5.0|I read this book for the first time right after I graduated high school. I've since read it at least 10 times, and always flip to a random page whenever I need inspiration to keep going. This review will be short and sweet. There's a lot of great advice to follow from this book. It's very simple and a quick read, but it will stay with you for a long time. Paulo Coelho is amazing. His early books like \\"The Alchemist\\" and \\"The Pilgrimage\\" are truly inspiring and worthwhile. Pick it up, you won't be disappointing!
B00A2BTCM4|1.0|I am only reviewing the 5.1 surround mix and not the entire package. This mix is dreadful. Most of it consists of extra reverb in the rear channels. It reminds me of the sound you get when you flick the \\"Simulated Surround\\" button on your receiver. There was so much potential in remixing this title. Understanding that Rush is a trio would seem to be constrictive to mapping out a surround mix but their masterful use of overdubbing rhythm guitar and synth/keyboards lends itself to moving the sound palette to multiple channels. This new mix doesn't even move Geddy's voice to the center channel. So, if you are looking to purchase on the strength of it's 5.1 surround mix.....don't bother. The remastered stereo mix is a much more satisfying experience.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!! I horseback ride so....that is why l LOVE LOVE LOVE the game. it does both English and western riding. so it works for both. you should totally get this game.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|Once again Denzel with help from John Goodman and a few other top notich names presents an outstanding presentation.  Best part was when the door to the &#34;other&#34; room was left open!
B003XTYDMQ|5.0|To end with a regular season ending is just wrong.  Thankfully Kristen still has hope for a movie.  Awesome series!!!
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I am counting down until the third book is released - I could totally relate to the characters, and I could not put this book down!
6305128952|5.0|I heard about this movie for so long and recently watched Buck, which prompted me to get the Horse Whisperer. The beginning of the movie when the girls went out for a ride which ended in disaster was heart breaking. Being a horse lover, I did hope to see significantly more horse whispering activity, but the movie had a dual plot, one related to the horse recovery and the other a love story. Regardless, it was a fabulous drama and will watch it again soon!!!
B004XIZN5M|5.0|Like alot of us work, kids, social life and keeping a house in working order takes up all my time.  Its hard to make time to work out.  This book is great, no gym, no equipment, you are the gym.  There is no arguing the history behind body weight training.  History is full of examples of gladiators, soldiers, athletes and strongmen who primarily trained using their own body weight as their primary training tool.  I've had the book for 3 weeks.  I read it completely before doing any of the excercises, and the so far its been working.  I'm a 44 year old male 5'10&#34; and I've gone from 209lbs to 196 in that time.  I have also quit drinking soda and dropped junk food from my diet.  More importantly, after starting the regimen my body has started to look better.  People notice and come right out and say &#34;You look like your losing weight&#34;.  There is some shoddy editing, but I bought this as a motivational tool.  I found it to be just what I needed to jump start a healthier lifestyle and have recommended to several of my friends.  For me it was worth the price and I've found it to be a good value.  The thing I like best is the steps are clearly outlined and the ultimate goals are just plain cool.  If a guy could eventually work up to a one arm handstand push up, you will be a bad ass!!
B009MCRHH6|4.0|Took me  awhile to figure out how to play.  I like how each level changes things.  Great way to waste time. haha
B005S9EJ14|4.0|The was a nice movie but a little more sad and depressing than its ads would indicate.  But on the other hand you can't beat the quality of actors and their mastery of the acting medium.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|Katniss was such a believable and cool character in the first two books.  The final book was a serious let-down... it felt like she couldn't do anything by herself and I really couldn't get into it.
B0084ANCBC|5.0|Talk about the upper one percent, the idle rich, braggarts and bullies and bullslhitters.  Loving someone for their looks, their money, the shallow foibles to which we can all relate.  Hilarious
B0053YGYO4|5.0|There seems to be a lot going on in this album and each time I listen to it I feel like I'm uncovering a new hidden element I wasn't aware of before. I guess the cliched term is that this album 'grows on you.' Overall a perfect blend of pop / feelgood aesthetic, avant garde / Brian Eno artiness, highly original guitar riffs and Chris Martin's wizardry with pen and voice.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Perfect white noise.  It has a little of everything.  And the fact that it was free makes it all great.
0425263908|5.0|I was never much of a smoker but, boy, did I want to light one up after finishing this novel! Bared to You is the kind of book that barrels into you like a freight train and plows over every emotional and erotic hotspot present in the human body. It has been compared countless times to 50 Shades of Grey and, yes, I understand the comparison. Bared to You is about a dominant male character with a past full of demons and a beautiful young woman (with demons of her own) who falls hard for him. The love story between these two characters is based on their strong sexual chemistry. But that is where the similarities between this book and 50 Shades of Grey end. In this novel, Sylvia Day tells the tale of a raw, obsessive, and at times heart-breaking love affair.  Ms. Day takes the reader through the characters' difficult journey toward healing their fractured selves, so that they can ultimately become part of a whole.<br /><br />The main character, Eva, has an abusive and troubled past that she is trying to overcome. She counts on work, friends, and supportive family members to keep her life steady and safe. Gideon Cross is the opposite of steady and safe. He crashes (literally) into Eva's world and the two of them start throwing off sparks that light up the sky.<br /><br />Bared to You is a smart, sexy, erotic thrill ride. Eva's character is down-to-earth and likeable. Gideon, while not necessarily being \\"likeable\\" right off the bat, does elicit feelings of empathy and leaves the reader desperate to learn more about his past. Did I mention he was hot? He leaps off the page as a sexy, driven, intelligent man with his own dark past. And his love for Eva knows no bounds.<br /><br />Can the undeniable passion that Eva and Gideon feel transform into something real and lasting? Can, Gideon, who comes with his own trunk full of baggage be a positive and stable fixture in Eva's life? And can two self-described dysfunctional people have a normal, healthy relationship? It isn't aneasy path, but fans of the HEA need to hang on for the ride as these two beautiful, damaged and passionate people fight for the love they both deserve.<br /><br />~Review by The Fictionista from When Pen Met Paper

B0010SKUYM|5.0|This guy can write.  Love the descriptions of characters, settings, and the magic that he uses.  It makes a fantasy book into something very believable.  I can't wait for the third book!
B0041KVZ0Y|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite Beatles records. The sound from the record is great, enoy it more than I do the cd. There is not a bad song on this record. If you're a Beatles fan this is a MUST OWN.....
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is my all time favorite game! the second i got my kindle it was the first game i got, an  i still play it! the graphics are great, the gameplay is great, and its th  perfect amount . of challenge without getting too frustrated :) best game ever by far!!!
B000OLRH10|4.0|This movie was so real . If you've ever seen anything about Sierra Leone this movie portrays everything I had already seen or heard about. This movie was excellent and I was very pleased.
B008CRC506|5.0|I look forward to watching this show every week.  The music is amazing, the acting (mostly) great, and I don't care how much you try to twist this show to compare it to Glee but it's on a completely different level.  The DVD is cool but I'm holding out for the Blu Ray.  Yes, I love this show enough to get it in HD!
B00AMBM9MO|1.0|The movie was hysterical, when it was on. I was watching on a 3mb stream and it took about 3 hours to watch this hour and a half long movie. Four or five times it stopped to load, then stopped saying the network was unavailable. The picture quality that I paid more to get looked like an amateur YouTube video. I will not be moving forward with this service.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Knowledge of the battery's status is crucial. This app gives you that, and gives details for how long you can do a list of activities before you'll run out of juice. Normally, I'll just throw a glance at the graphical battery to look at the percentage of a fully charged the battery. If it's 100% after recharging, I know AOK, and I know there will be no surprises while using my Kindle or iPhone.<br />It's a good, cheap and very useful battery info app. I use it regularly.
B00A9T1HUO|3.0|I never thought I would complain about a Josh Groban album. I've been a fan from the start and have watched as he has progressed throughout his career, growing not only in maturity but also in musicality. His last album, \\"Illuminations\\", was a departure from his previous sound - but better because of it. At some point, an artist needs to grow or risk stagnation, and Josh had done so on every album.<br /><br />Until this one.<br /><br />In many ways, \\"All That Echoes\\" is four giant steps backwards, back to his self-titled debut album, back to when he was a high school kid with a big voice, recording cover songs and pieces that, while good, lacked the honesty that would emerge on later records. The last record featured Groban's songwriting on 11/13 tracks; my Target bonus track edition of the new one has his name credited on only 50% of the sixteen songs. I don't know if this pulling back is due to a lack of inspiration, a desire to record more cover songs, or the fact that there was a much smaller gap between this one and its predecessor than he's had in awhile, but the lack of orginality definitely shows. It's by far his most disappointing work.<br /><br />I would like to make clear that the record is by no means awful. Lead single 'Brave' is truly a cousin to earlier hit 'You are Loved (Don't Give Up)', both in its message and musicality. It's an addictive song that I've had on repeat on my Spotify since its release. 'False Alarms' is also a good song, with an energy and freshness that the rest of the album lacks. Unfortunately, it's all downhill from there.<br /><br />I'm not too sure what sound Groban was going for on 'Below the Line', which, despite its gorgeous lyrics, is a bad cross between seventies soft rock and something from the Miami Sound Machine. Neither works with the melody of the song or Josh's voice. His cover of 'Falling Slowly' is alright, though the added instrumentation takes something away from the sincerity of the original, and even his duet with huge talent (and voice) Laura Pausini somehow manages to fall flat, despite the talent of the two singers involved.<br /><br />The four bonus tracks on my edition include live hit 'Changing Colours', which redeems the second half of the record; this is one of the few cover songs that works. In addition, the cover of Neil Diamond's 'Play Me' is delightful. It's a shame neither of these is included on the standard edition.<br /><br />The album in itself isn't bad, truly. But I've found it to be quite boring. Groban grew so much musically from his first to fourth albums, and while some fans are thrilled that this one harkens back to his debut work, to me it seems more of a regression than a look back. I will still put the album on my iPod (though some tracks will be left off), and I will still eagerly attend his next tour. But I'm hoping the next album is a step forward rather than a few steps back.
B0013UIUBC|5.0|She seems a little uptight, but loosens as the movie goes along.  It was a great movie.  I would see it again!
B000MXFPH8|3.0|I would have loved to given this takoyaki pan 5 stars if possible, it's light, comes in a beautiful design and has the easiest cooking ability ever, with just an on and off switch.  Unfortunately the item that I got was a dud and I was NOT able to cook a batch of takoyaki as I had hoped and was quite disappointed.  The company that sold me the pan AOYAMA was quite prompt to remedy this issue and was gracious enough to issue back a full refund.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another great book of John Grisham!<br />I read it in 2 days!<br />It is a lot better book than The Litigators!
B00AAX68HG|4.0|pudding monsters not a bad game. I play it when there's nothing to do. it passes the time. id recommend it to my friends
B00364K6YW|5.0|Ever try reading Pride and Prejudice, the novel by Jay Austin? It will put you to sleep.  However, the movie as brought to life by this production, is painless. It is well acted and very enjoyable.  I streamed it first, then bought it, as it is well worth another look.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Just keeps getting better & better!!  I hope they continue on to Season 4, 5, 6, etc.  Thanks Amazon for the Movie Pass too!
B009X01FJS|5.0|This case is great. It's so soft to the touch and the color is beautiful. The way  Kindle revolves and the case makes a stand is so convenient for people who have trouble holding a book. You never have to take it out of the case. You can charge it while in the case. I'm so happy with this product!
B008RJFRTK|1.0|Didn't like it at didn't work at all off line at all wasn't sastisedfied with it not worth downloading at all
B008WOUK0G|4.0|What a voice and great lyrics. Heard 'Flying' in a Starbucks and had to find out a little more about the artist. Definitely liked what I heard, although 2 months later and i still can't get enough of 'Flying'. Something about that song really hits somewhere inside of me. Can't quite figure it out -- maybe it's the melanchoy that I get from it. forget the critics and analysis -- if you like a raspy baritone, something like you would expect in a 60s or 70s coffee shop, on stage with an acoustic guitar, you might like this.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|It's like Tetris with groceries. Addictive, challenging and fun. They have you fill bags trying not to break things, then challenge you to break as much as you can. Good pacing, enjoyable.
B004HX0P2Y|5.0|Wasn't going to purchase this movie, but I missed seeing it at the show, so bit the bullet and bought it.  Not sorry, enjoyed the movie and will certainly go see Red 2.
B009TZBEKW|4.0|I could do without We Found A Love but the rest of the album is good. Here 2 China is great.
B009X01C64|5.0|I really like this product. It's protected my kindle fire hd that I got for Christmas amazing well! I don't throw it against my wall for fun in my spare time or anything but I have accidentally dropped it 2 times now and it protected it completely both times. I also like how it's leather on the outside and looks professional. Once opened up, I love how it automatically cues up the unlock screen and that the hand strap on the back makes it so much easier to hold. I have to admit that I haven't really used the stand portion as much but this is the one thing that I think could use some improvement. When my kindle is laying landscape, I feel like it's just awkward to see the screen in all 3 slant choices that there are so I don't use it too much. Now when it's in portrait I've really liked it cause it makes sitting at a table and reading a book easier so the kindle stands by itself and all you have to do is swipe your finger across the screen to turn the page.<br /><br />All in all, I would heavily recommend this product to anyone looking for a sturdy & stylish case.
0525958002|5.0|I definitely recommend this book to read for any Duranie from days past and now.  I've been a fan since the beginning and still can't wait to hear that they're touring in my area.  A great book to understand how the band formed and all of their success and excess, of course.
B0039HR5QS|5.0|This oldie but goody has great acting, a great plot and while not a newer film,I had forgotten how entertaining it is.<br /><br />i

B004QKNXIQ|4.0|Nice take on the Fairy Tale.  Fun way to pass a rainy day, just wish I could have watched it on my TV, instead of my lap top.
B005LAII12|2.0|I watched the unrated version with my wife and we both hated Ted.  First off I am ok with the idea of a raunch talking teddy after all I watch Wilfred and love that show so I am ok with the idea of Ted.  I just felt Ted the character was not funny nor was the character well developed and I would have liked to see Ted take the rauchiness further.  I also had trouble with Teds voice since it was done by Seth McFarland I kept thinking I was watching a boring episode of family guy.  The plot was somewhat predictible nothing to write home about.  I have recently seen some Adam Sandler movies and been disappointed so perhaps my tastes are maturing as I get older but Ted did very little for me or my wife.  However two younger people in my office (early 20's) loved the movie and qoute it all day long and sing the Thunder Buddies song at least once a week.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|This app took me three weeks to get best app ever but i think its to expensive but still really fun
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The writing & acting are excellent.  It is addicting & I can't wait for the next episode.  The make up of the zombies is  great.
0439023513|5.0|great story line, love sci-fi, creative, imaginative, suspenseful, fun read, enjoyed it, would recommend it, large print was fine, worth it
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I cant wait to see the movie, although the movie is never as good as the book.  What a great read.
B006LSZECO|3.0|A good read that's hard to put down. Chapters switch between wife's diary entries and husbands point of view. Mysterious and kept me guessing most of the time. Will there be a sequel?
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I am addicted to the original Temple Run, I have it on both of my kindles and phone.  I easily have played a 100 hours of the original Temple Run.  I was excited to see Temple Run 2.  The new version is more challenging and I most likely put in about 15 hours playing the game and still my scores are nowhere near the original game.  It seems like there are more options on the game for the magnets, speed runs, etc the only problem is i have trouble timing my jumps to grab the jewel etc. and miss them more often than not.  Also when you collect enough coins you can swipe the meter when it is at the max and you will get the magnet yet doing this as the same time you play the game is an art form as i most often die trying to swipe for my magnets.  Also the monkey is so big that when it chases you it takes up a large chunk of screen and I have trouble focusing on whats ahead of me as the monkey is so distracting.  What I do like is the graphics are really nice, the game has more challenges including the mine cart.  I just dont feel this version is as addicting as the original.
1439148953|3.0|Brooklyn is a very quiet novel. There is no great conflict, no drama, no angst, no soul searching. And yet, against the odds, it is fascinating in its own unique way. The language accounts for much of the book's charm--it is straightforward and unadorned, yet has an honesty and a rhythm all its own.<br /><br />Eilis Lacey is a very ordinary Irish girl: religious, obedient, kind, conscientious about her duties and obligations. It is the early 1950's, and job opportunities are very limited for a young Irish girl with no specific training. When an Irish priest from Brooklyn offers her the opportunity to go to America, she feels it is her duty to her family to go, even though she really does not want to.<br /><br />In her new country Eilis suffers greatly from homesickness, but does her best as a shopgirl and even takes a course in bookkeeping to better her job chances. Just as she begins to feel at home in her new country, she meets a young man at a parish dance and cautiously finds herself falling in love, only to be called back to Ireland by a death in her family. Once there she again suffers a sense of displacement, no longer knowing where her true home lies.<br /><br />The story is so simple; the characters are so ordinary; Eilis is so passive, letting others determine her future time after time. But it sounds so true, especially for a girl like Eilis in her time and place.<br /><br />Not an exciting page-turner, but good reading, all the same.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|I enjoyed the flick most of the way through, though my spouse found it far to violent and could not watch it to the end.  She is tired of seeing NYC destroyed.
0671027387|5.0|very suspenseful, great story, great for sci-fi lovers, somewhat political but great read, would recommend it, fun read, you will love it

B009GEBBNQ|5.0|The avengers is a great movie I can't wait to see the next one And I think my favorite character in this movie is the Incredible Hulk
0316223239|4.0|This is the story of a young woman imprisoned by a sexual predator in an 11' x 11' room, rearing her 5-year-old son. Sounds like it was \\"ripped from the headlines,\\" doesn't it. This could have been just a creepy, sensationalistic thriller in less capable hands, but Donoghue turns it into a moving testimony to the bonds of love between a mother and child. The second half of the book focuses on another equally touching aspect of mother-child love--the necessity of a mother's letting go to allow the child to flourish as a separate human being.<br /><br />Taking a big risk, Donoghue tells her story in first-person through the voice of the child. This could have turned out badly if the voice had sounded at all wrong. But it sounds right for an intelligent child who has had constant adult companionship. This allows the author to put the emphasis of the story where she wants it to be--on the emotions of the two captives rather than on the circumstances of their captivity.<br /><br />I cannot claim to have objectivity about this book, because for me (as a mother) it had such a strong emotional appeal. I don't know if men would like it nearly as much. I doubt that it can be counted as a great \\"artistic achievement,\\" in the sense of being groundbreaking, innovative, or cerebral. But boy, is it a good read!
B004EBT6HE|4.0|In this fast-paced novel of suspense, the antagonist's doom quest keeps you guessing how much havoc he'll wreak before/if he's stopped.
0316067938|5.0|wonderful read, definitely recommend, very suspenseful, twist at end, keeps you engaged with new innovations, worth it, great for twilight lovers
B004IDG97S|5.0|Still great and completely watchable after all these years. I am afraid to watch the remake because I fear it will tarnish such a good thing...<br /><br />---<br /><br />Update: Watched the remake. Don't bother. Nothing like the original and very disappointing.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love this game. Have to argue with the family to not spend my coins, wish they accumulated quicker. Always wanted to play the real game, but not have to spend lots of money so this is a great alternative. Highly recommend.

0375703861|3.0|White Teeth tells the story of Archie Jones, a white lower-middle-class Englishman, and his best friend Samad Iqbal, a devout Muslim immigrant to England from Bangladesh, and of their ancestors and their children. It covers a lot of ground and features a great hodge-podge of nationalities and religions. For example--Archie's wife is a Jamaican-English mix who was reared as a Jehovah's Witness but who has rejected her religious upbringing; Samad's wife is from Bangladesh, but for her the Muslim religion is inconsequential; Archie's daughter Irie is just a mixed-up, mixed-race girl trying to find a direction; Samad has twin sons--Magid, who grows up to be an atheist, and Mallat, who grows up to be an almost-accidental Muslim extremist. The lives of the two families become entangled with the lives of Marcus and Joyce Chalfen, who are upper-middle-class English and lapsed Catholic-Jewish atheists, and their son Joshua, who turns into an animal-rights activist. Suffice it to say, many viewpoints are represented here.<br /><br />This book had a strange effect on me. When I was reading it, I liked it very much and read far into the night to complete it. When I had finished and thought about it, I didn't like it nearly as much.<br /><br />The tone is satirical and humorous, but on reflection it seems to me to be almost mocking and superior. Smith comes up with some very, very funny observations about people and culture, but when events turn more serious her tone trivializes the gravity of consequences. She seems to be ridiculing her characters; the daughter Irie is the only character not lampooned, and she represents, obviously, the intelligent observer--in other words, Smith herself.<br /><br />Smith introduces several themes--nature versus nurture, fate (what goes around comes around), and the perils and advantages of cultural assimilation. It is unclear, however, what her central point is intended to be. She never really follows an idea through to completion.<br /><br />The ending, which brings together all the various ethnic and religious factions, is predictable, on reflection. However, it did take considerable ingenuity in plot construction to get all these people involved in one event in order to have the grand finale.<br /><br />This is a feel-good novel, in that you come to believe, \\"We can all get along.\\" But I don't believe (regardless of many opinions in the opposite direction)that it is a GREAT novel.<br /><br />So I would say, \\"Read it!\\" It will hold your attention; it is often very funny; it has just enough suspense that it will carry you through to the end. Then think about it--was it as good as you originally thought?The ending, which brings together all the various ethnic and religious factions, is predictable, on reflection.

B009IJJ5B4|5.0|My wife and I really enjoy this series.  We find most of the shows now on TV to be silly, insulting or just dumb.  This is an intelligent interpretation of the Sherlock Holmes character and i really like the use of Lucy Liu as Dr. Watson.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|Before I purchased this book, I read the reviews and thought one review was kind of odd since it said that he liked the first half of the book, but not the second half.  Well, this review was right on.  The beginning of the book is engaging and mysterious.  The second half is all love, mush, love, mush.  I thought I was going to scream if he &#34;kissed the top of her head&#34; one more time.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|They did a heck of a job improving on this game from the graphics to the monster that chases you GREAT JOB

B00ANW33CM|1.0|The developer needs to go back to the basics. This game has so much bloated graphics and junk that it opens slow. I went to what I thought was the beginning of the first level, although I can't tell for sure without directions, there was just one cube and a countdown that moves to quickly for you to figure out what to do. Uninstalled
142311339X|5.0|For those people who loves Percy Jackson and the Olympians series, you will love the new series of Heroes of Olympus. Some old characters from Percy Jackson series are in new series of Heroes of Olympus.<br /><br />Hint: Percy Jackson disappeared, Annabeth is in the book also there is new characters added, you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Remember, Percy Jackson & the Olympians: the Last Olympian book at the end about new PROPHECY announced after Percy Jackson asked his friend (i forget her name) became Oracle.<br /><br />New and old characters are in the new series Heroes of Olympus below.<br /><br />The Lost Hero<br />Son of Neptune<br />Mark of Athena<br />House of Hades (new book will be out in October 2013)<br /><br />I own all the books, I love it very much

B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Was able to catch up on this one via Amazon when we would otherwise possibly never catch it as a rerun. It made the season complete for us.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Its finally here! The graphics are outstanding and it is so much fun. Even my dad likes it and he is the major game critic (even though he doesn't play them.) But beware of the things you have to buy with real money sometimes I accidentally click buy thinking its for the coins but its for real money. but otherwise fantastic!
034580404X|5.0|I fell in love the books. Great Chemistry between Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele. The more Christian realizes he is totally into Anastasia that he never had before. Anastasia gets to know Christian more depth and darker but She is the one that brings Christian to the light. There is a balance between them that works great in relationship. Dont think of sex stuff. Just see it through Christian and Anastasia's life to make it work. I love it...
B001HBYHFA|5.0|If you're not familiar with the Firefly series or Serenity, I highly recommend it (but watch the Firefly TV show first). It is basically a sci-fi with wild-west themes and very good character development. I consider Serenity to be one of my favorite movies if not my top favorite.

B004HYDM0A|2.0|Too predictable . Sloooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow moving. No plot . Bad acting. Vague character evolution.<br /> I would not recommend paying for this movie
1400052181|5.0|I absolutely love this moving tribute to Ms. Henrietta Lacks, and the reason I love it is that Ms. Skloot has presented a very nuanced and sympathetic view of everyone involved, whether on the exploitative side or the exploited side. Truthfully, every single one of us who's lived since then, and who has benefited from cancer treatments and practically anything to do with modern medicine, can be counted among the exploiters. And yet Ms. Skloot doesn't single out any person or institution as being \\"the villain\\" of the piece, but the picture she paints of this entire saga is an unflinching view of the truth. A truly extraordinary book.<br /><br />I'm currently on my 5th paper copy of the book (because I keep giving it away to people to read), and own both the e-book and regular book versions, because I love to have it handy to read any time, any place.
1423101464|5.0|I love this book. Battle of Labyrinth is like maze but maze changes. Greek Camp Half Blood is well protected. But threatened by the Labyrinth cave secret entrance will have access directly to Half Blood. New quest for Annabeth, Percy, Grover, and Tyson (Percy's half brother) go into labyrinth to find Daedalus to prevent Kronos's & Luke's forces access to labyrinth that leads directly to Half Blood camp. Warning, there is no way out cuz the maze changes from time to time. Love this book.<br />I own it.....

1423101472|5.0|I recommended you all to read the books before reading this final book. It was action packed. Great connection between Percy Jackson and Annabeth Chase. Great costly battle at the end. It is non stop read. I read it again again again. Loved this final book<br /><br />Great news to know new series Heroes of Olympus came alive in old and new characters. you would love the old and new series......You will not be disappointed..
030758836X|4.0|I was a little reluctant to read \\"Gone Girl at first due to some negative feedback from other readers. But I decided to take a chance anyway. Once I started reading, I was hooked. Nick and Amy are both very troubled and despicable people. Their narcissism, arrogance, and selfishness made me want to slap both of them. The only character I really liked was Go(Nick's sister).  With the exception of the ending, I think the author did a good job. Hopefully there is a sequel in the works -- if there is I hope the ending will be better.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is the best one since the last two. so much more fun. plus its harder, more fun, and also more things. best one yet. keep up the good work!
034580404X|5.0|I've wanted to purchase these books for a long time and I'm glad I was able to get the trilogy plus donate to Goodwill. The books are amazing and well worth reading. I'm going to read them again. I hope the author decides towrite more books. The purchase amount was awesome and I saved $10.00.
B007FJFDXS|3.0|Interesting concept for a game, however, controlling the cube can be difficult at times.  But it is fun and enjoyable.
B000002KDO|5.0|As an Ozzy fan, my goal was to collect all Ozzy and Ozzy-era Black Sabbath albums. I love this third album, as it contains many of my favorites, such as &#34;Children of the Grave&#34;, &#34;After Forever&#34;, and &#34;Into the Void&#34;.

0316069884|4.0|First off, I'd like it to be known that I am an Iowa girl, I've lived in this great state my entire life. Clearly an ag state and the number one producer of pork in the nation. It is literally everywhere. I can't think of a government luncheon or dinner that I've been to that didn't serve pork loin as the main course. My mom is from Minnesota and grew up on a farm that my grandma still lives on today. They didn't have animals but their neighbors do. Every morning we step outside of my grandmothers house you can smell the pigs wafting through the air piercing your nose with the stench that is swine. The pools of animal waste mentioned in this book are visible in the neighbors yards as you drive by and I remember my mom even making a joke about them the last time we were home how you'd think it was a pond but no it's waste, imagine that! But after reading this book I wonder if she even understands the dangers involved in all of this because she grew up around it and is acustom to it.<br /><br />Not sure if this review will include spoilers because it's not as much a story line as an awareness containing facts about our farming industry but I'll state a warning now that some may not want to read any further.<br /><br />I have seen the food documentaries Food inc. and I've been exposed to various other informational pieces discussing the flaws in our current ag system. I interned for the Governor of Iowa from last August to May and remember when their was a law being brought up in the House and Senate concerning whether or not it is legal to record video footage of farming operations without being honest about who you are to Iowa farmers. I remember the phone calls we received during that time, there were literally 5 of us on the phones that day (more than the usual 3) and we were getting non-stop phone calls. Literally the second you put down the phone your phone was ringing again before you let go. We got phone calls from as far away as Turkey. News was spreading fast and it was clear that many were concerned. The one thing I regret is that many feel that farmers who do have poor practices within their operations, don't care about their animals and I know that by and large that is false. This book did a great job of highlighting that no one gets into these practices out of hatred for animals everywhere. But I agree that something does need to change.<br /><br />After watching Food inc. and other documentaries I felt that I had a good handle and knew what was going on but this book revealed to me just how much I didn't know. Sure the book has it's flaws and maybe isn't structured in the best way it could have been but I feel the content is no less important because of these flaws. It will still surely prove to be jaw dropping for most readers.<br /><br />Sadly I don't think I have the will-power to be a vegan or vegetarian as the book mentions is one of the best ways to fight factory farming but I know now what to be aware of when I do consume meat, what to look for on labels, and a better awareness of what had to occur in order for the food I'm eating to be on my plate. To know that for every helping of shrimp that I eat (formerly my favorite seafood) about 5 feet of fish had to die for me to eat that shrimp in the by-catch. I know that roughly 90% of the chicken on the market is infected with salmonella or some other bacteria. I know that my meat has been soaked in water to increase weight without actually increasing the amount of meat I'm buying. I know that most animals live a miserable life before they were eventually killed and landed on my plate.<br /><br />For those who argue that abuse is not the norm in the farming industry today I wonder how they would feel if their dog had to spend a day on one of these farms or if they knew that when their dog had to be put down one day it would be killed in a similar manner as these animals. Maybe then they would change their mind as to whether or not we are acting ethically in thefood and meat processing industry. Maybe.food and meat processing industry. Maybe.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is fun game for everyone and all ages as the family and friends all get together an play against each other
B00992CF6W|2.0|I tried and tried to buy it but I couldn't buy it.It is so hard to buy.Does not work on Kindle Fire.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B009LK6JS2|4.0|The controls can be hard to handle some times and some times it doesn't recognize my button pressing in order to toggle the flaps or move the landing gear up or down.  But the rest of the game is fun and interesting.  The landscapes and scenarios that you play out could be more interesting or detailed, but I like the game and enjoy the semi-realistic flight experience.
B000002KET|5.0|As an Ozzy fan, my goal was to collect all Ozzy and Ozzy-era Black Sabbath albums. This album just blows me away. The songs &#34;Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath&#34; and &#34;A National Acrobat&#34; give off such heavy, memorable riffs which really showcase the talent of the band.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Hoping for a movie or mini series adaptation! Such a good read! You won't put it down! Highly recommended indeed
0316010669|5.0|Although a bit repetitive and possibly over worked I really enjoyed this book, I couldn't put it down. Some of the criticism has been about the repeated theme of the book which I'll admit is there but I found his examples and stories he shared to be what I loved about the book. I highly recommend this book especially to those who have an interest in psychology.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|Grandkids really enjoy playing the game with each other an friends too.  I thank you for having good games to play.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I cant even connect to a server anywhere. Different places and motems  are not even working. There needs to be caves and better controls for creative mode. I give it a &quot;D&quot;. NOT EVEN KIDDING.
B005IQ39AY|3.0|Maybe I haven't found the right setting or something, but every time I start the game, I am starting from scratch.  The scoring and when the level is over is not very clear either - I just don't understand its rules and how it grades things.  It's simple graphics, nice vibrant colors and the accuracy is pretty good to send the ball where I am aiming it.  But there's just too much mystery and starting over from level 1 is annoying to the point that I don't play it much.
B000002KFJ|5.0|As an Ozzy fan, my goal was to collect all Ozzy and Ozzy-era Black Sabbath albums. As for this album, my favorite song is hands-down &#34;Sympton of the Universe&#34;. It's songs like this especially that seem to really show where much of the inspiration for bands like Metallica might have come from.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love the game my daughter loves it. she plays all the time. even when shes not supposed to. love it
B00ANYJ3NI|5.0|This book is presented to us in a reader friendly manner that makes this complicated story of true events easy to follow and the dots easy to connect. The recession of 2008 impacted nearly everyone in the United States and made its presence known all over the globe from the trickle down after effects that were spread out to other nations as well. There were many factors that contributed to the events of 2008 but there were key mistakes that were made and key shifts in the world of investing that played a major role and contributed greatly to these events.<br /><br />Even if you are not familiar with investing or not of a financial background, this book will be easy for you to follow and a worthwhile read. I'd recommend this book to just about anyone and I feel it is an important read and book to have in your library.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|What would people do with out the abobe reader as that is how you get most of your information. I like that is easy to update and use.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Great story line and holds your interest through every episode,can't wait for season 3. Would recommend to everyone interested in horror.
B003O86FMW|5.0|After the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, this was the best series I've ever read.  Good stuff!<br />I loved this series.
1616550414|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing, and as a hardcore The Legend of Zelda fan, this was an absolutely necessary buy for me, and I am absolutely amazed by its content.
B007IQX1G4|3.0|If you like odd dark comedies which have a bigger meaning...then this movie is for you. I laughed and cried. I thought it was a cool piece of work and well done on all accounts.
1878424319|5.0|Initially I was worried that this book might be a bit too mystic for my tastes or that it would conflict with my current faith and spiritual beliefs. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it did not conflict with my faith but rather enhanced or gave me a new way of looking at my current faith. I had so many 'aha' moments as I was reading this book. I think it has so much information that is invaluable to anyone who reads this book. I also think that this will be a book that I have to re-visit every one in a while as a good reminder.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone who needs a little help clearing their mind, cleaning up their social life, or believing in themselves. This book is absolutely fantastic.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I am not real sure about face book and how much I can trust my information on it. I like it as you can share with so many people also it also allows so many people to your information if your not careful.
B003N0XDT4|5.0|I Bought this taken a chance that it would not work with my samsung galaxy nexus. I have an Iphone 4s and of course it works with that but I was worried because I tried to research and everything I read was negative about it working with other phones. I plugged it in with a micro usb cord and it works flawlessly!!!! I just knew I was gonna have to send it back but Luckily I did not have to.  THIS is a MUST have if you have spent money on a decent pair of Headphones. I'm using this with Audio Technicas ATH-50'S AND SAMSUNG GALAXY NEXUS RUNNING ON ANDROID 4.1.1.<br /><br />UPDATE: JUST PLUGGED THIS INTO MY LAPTOP W/ EXTERNAL SPEAKERS WOW WHAT A DIFFERENCE!!! DEFIANTLY WORTH THE MONEY!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read all three books in three days.  Very, very Good!  Once I started I simply couldn't stop and wished there was more.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's great I play it at least hours a day it is so much more fun than what I usually do I used to spend hours on instagram or texting but stopped and started to play subway surf
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was yet another great Nicholas sparks book! Can't wait to start another one. He's such a good author! Amazing
0345803485|2.0|I really wanted to like this book seeing as it is wildly popular, I almost feel like there must be something wrong with me because of how much I did not enjoy this book.<br /><br />Obviously there was the poor writing which everyone has already touched on about this book and is a well known fact. I also had an issue with the characters. I felt that there was almost no depth to their characters and I felt like they ran in circles probing each other for details that would have added meaning to the characters but instead of divulging into some interesting background on the characters it was always \\"Hush Anastasia, I want you.\\" and her response of \\"Holy crap, he wants me\\". SO REPETITIVE!!!<br /><br />And honestly, the sex scenes weren't even that hot in my opinion. I've only read one other romance novel and it was so hot I could hardly take it as I was reading it but with this novel I didn't get riled up at all.<br /><br />I think the real reason that women are drawn to this novel is that it gives them hope that a relationship they currently have that is based on the physical may turn into something more. That's what every woman wants and too many women are waiting for a guy to make that change, when most likely he never will. It's an adult fairy tale if you will. Leading women to believe that maybe their friend with benefits will suddenly want \\"more\\" and be so in rapture with them. Please.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I really like the game it has been a real joy for my grandchildren, friends and myself as we all play an share our scores<br />Thank you
B007FIY3VW|3.0|It's great to be able to work on the kindle, but it keeps shutting down randomly., so you have to save every 2 minutes to make sure you don't lose any work.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was as good as the first two....was sad to have it end.  I think if you enjoyed the Twilight series or the Girl with the Dragon Tatto, you will love this series too.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A great read. Makes you proud that there are individuals who put themselves out, to that level, for us and our country.<br /><br />For those readers who like a Clancy or Dale Brown book, you will love this.  I started this in the airport, finished it on a transcon flight.  Couldn't stop.
B000GIWS7E|5.0|Back in 1992 I remember hearing a small segment of \\"Pull Me Under\\" on the radio and not being all that impressed. Now skip forward to the fall of 2009. For years I had been hearing about this band Dream Theater and how incredible they were. Different friends of mine (some of whom were musicians, and some of whom were not) kept telling me over and over again that I really needed to check this band out. Well I finally decided to take a chance on Dream Theater, so I ordered a used copy of this DVD. I remember getting it in the mail, opening the package and liking the artwork on the front of the DVD. After glancing at the tracklisting on the back I decided to put in disc 2 to watch the documentary first so I could get some background information on each individual member of the band and some overall history on them as well. After watching and enjoying the documentary I finally got around to watching the concert itself. Let me tell you something! I WAS COMPLETELY BLOWN AWAY! I couldn't believe what I was seeing and hearing! I remember thinking to myself \\"is this the same band that I heard all those years ago?\\" Well after thoroughly enjoying this DVD for a couple of weeks I got back on Amazon and ordered Dream Theater's entire discography including the rest of their DVDs and a couple of live rarities. In my life there have been a few moments when I've heard music that has completely changed my outlook on music and broadened my musical horizons. I clearly remember the first time I heard the Beatles, the Stones, Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Genesis, Yes, Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, the Who and so on, and so on. Dream Theater's \\"Score 20th Anniversary Tour (Live With The Octovarium Orchestra)\\" DVD was one of those \\"OMG\\" moments for me, and my life has forever been changed for the better since I discovered this amazing group of extremely gifted musicians. Please do yourself a huge favor and order this DVD. I promise that it'll be one of the best investments in a music DVD you'll ever make. I can't recommend this DVD highly enough! I hope this review has or will be somewhat useful in helping you to make a wise and fully informed purchase, and I hope that Dream Theater will have as much of a positive impact on your life as they've had on mine. Thanks for reading. PEACE!in a music DVD you'll ever make. I can't recommend this DVD highly enough! I hope this review has or will be somewhat useful in helping you to make a wise and fully informed purchase, and I hope that Dream Theater will have as much of a positive impact on your life as they've had on mine.

B007B6VOG0|4.0|Some with likely say that Some Nights is a definite sophomore slump. However, I would beg to differ. Though the singles off the album are overplayed on popular radio--especially the ubiquitous &#34;We Are Young&#34; which is perhaps the oldest song of 2012--there is depth off this album that is unknown. I'm a big fan of &#34;It Gets Better&#34; which seems to be connected to the AWESOME video campaign.<br /><br />From a musical perspective, there is still the same harmonic complexity of Nate Reuss' is known for all the way back to &#34;The First Single&#34; and The Format. However, it does have more of a poppy production. A lot of the auto-tuning is overdone, but other than that, its a solid cut. Gotta give it a good rating.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I read the reviews on this book before i actually purchased it and i must say, this book is truly amazing! The very best first kiss ever, a twist in the story that makes you want to cry and scream, but written so wonderful with a sensational ending. One of the best books i have ever read!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|A really fun game to play with your friends.  It is like Pictionary.  I recommend a stylus to help with your artistry but it is not necessary.  Fun!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I don't miss an episode. Each week I look forward to the next episode on AMC. This show Rocks. Yeah
B0077POH8M|5.0|As other reviewers state, you do have to install this cooler with the motherboard out of the case. This is a fact of life, for nearly all low-profile coolers; you save height clearance by removing the stock motherboard bracket with the fan clip holders on it, and using a backplate so you can screw the heatsink's bracket directly to the motherboard.<br /><br />It's also a fact of life for HTPC and SFF builds; they are always more difficult, and you have to do the build in the order specified by the case manufacturer, to fit everything into the special compact case. So normally you would start by installing your low-profile RAM onto the motherboard, then your CPU, paste, and this fan. (It's best to sit the mobo on top of some anti-static foam while you're working on it; hopefully you have some from the motherboard's box or another piece of electronics you bought.) If the mobo, memory, and CPU/fan all fit together OK, then you proceed with the build according to the case's instructions.<br /><br />Other reviewers have also pointed out that the included instructions have small print; however you can download the manual online and see it much bigger. (It's 2013, this is a computer part, who cares about printed instructions.) The instructions are mostly pictures, not unlike assembly instructions for international furniture. So pay really close attention to the orientation of the clip items as you add them to the backplate and fan.<br /><br />Also, you will have a much easier time installing this fan, with another pair of hands. It's do-able by yourself, because they include some two-sided tape to help hold the backplate in place while you install the fan. But it's much easier with a friend holding the board still, while you align the backplate and tape it on. Then your friend turns the board over, and holds the board & backplate steady for you on the work surface, while you install the CPU, paste, & fan. The rest of it's easy, especially with the included (custom?) deep,spring-loaded screws making it easier to apply even pressure to the CPU & paste as you tighten the heatsink down.<br /><br />If you've already built your computer and just want a clip-on fan, you might want to consider something else; but this is a really great, quiet, efficient, cooler, and well worth the extra installation effort.<br /><br />Once installed, it's just as effective as my older Zalman HTPC model from 5 years ago from this same line. It runs quiet under low CPU load, and doesn't make much noise under heavy load. It drops the temperature over the stock CPU cooler, by at least 10° C. This is even with the Arctic Silver still fresh; that paste has a 'curing' period of 200 hours before it achieves full cooling power, so the fan is having to work harder than it will after the curing completes.<br /><br />I went for this fan, over the similar CNPS8900 Extreme, because it has a lower noise rating, and because it has no distracting LED for an HTPC build. The Extreme has more cooling power, but I don't need that much, because I am using a low-wattage (65W) CPU. The heaviest tasks this computer does are watching my HDTV tuner & HD video files/streams, and maybe some day upgrading it with a Bluray player. Also I usually have *tons* of Chrome tabs open (literally up to 100 sometimes). Sometimes I stream full-screen 1080p Y*uT*be on one of those tabs, and it does this fine, even for videos that last an hour or more. It also runs HD Amazon Instant Video, and that *other* big streaming video service in HD, just fine.<br /><br />I expect the fan will outlive the rest of the HTPC, just like the older Zalman in my last HTPC build did. If you're trying to cram a microATX or miniITX mobo into a crowded case, the CNPS8900 Quiet is definitely the best fan to keep your CPU as cool and quiet as possible. If you need a little more cooling power, and don't mind the LED and a little bit of extra noise, go for the CNPS8900 Extreme, also available on Amazon for the same price. Either way get yourself some Arctic Silver, and this fan will be more than capable of cooling everything with a 100W or less processor. The CNPS8900 Extreme with Arctic Silver would probably cool a 125W OK, but I couldn't say that for sure.

0316187216|5.0|Mr. Abercrombie does it again.<br /><br />What an awesome, awesome novel. I would have liked to see more of the First of the Magi and his schemes.<br /><br />I love this mans books, the only sad thing about this is that I have to wait a year or more for another publication from this author. Ah well... I'll just go re-read all of his novels again and maybe both of Mark Lawrence's.
