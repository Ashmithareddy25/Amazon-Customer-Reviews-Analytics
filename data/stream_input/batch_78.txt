B008TV8ZBI|4|Great looking shirt on my girlfriend!!
B00CFQV8IA|2|So-o-o-o disappointed in this robe. I ordered the XL, but it is more like a medium. The rope on it is so short its pathetic. Also, I'm only 5'2&#34;, and this should have been a lot longer. Think when it was made, they put the wrong size on this one. The color was ok, but passing this one on to someone who will enjoy it.
B0007CKQ4Q|5|Wrangler quality one has come to expect.  The feel and heavy duty denim good for a hard days work for many a day!
B00M2V3CXW|5|Great comfortable athletic fit.
B005H3BT46|5|Good quality!
B00Q0GKAJO|5|Great price and really comfortable!!
B00LAU0XXI|5|So very comfortable, I don't want to take them off. Look forward to wearing these super soft and stretchy jeans. Comfy and supportive.  Don't stretch out or get baggy. Waistline is kind of high, but really comfortable.
B00J3F2Z5Q|5|There is a quality about these leggings that you don't find in other leggings. I would definitely buy them again.
B00IDURWW8|4|These are nice colored socks.  The red is more of a wine red than a fire engine red.  The are nice Gold Toe socks in colors.  They fit well.
B0040JGNEO|5|Have purchased many of this style of Haggar slacks over the years and have never been disappointed. Nice color selection on line not usually present in stores.
B0017RGKWW|5|I was visiting some folks in Colorado last year, when we went to Estes Park. I went into a Motorcycle shop down there, and saw this belt buckle. I loved it, but didn't have the money.    This is a good quality buckle for the price here. the detail is amazing! other than the red you see in the photo, the screw driver handle is transparent yellow, and the spark plug insulator is white, there is also a good black background behind the top and bottom-side letters. makes for a nice piece!    I would recommend this to anyone who you know is a mechanic, auto-technician, or an auto-tech student(Like myself) as a gift. the price is right, the quality's great, and is a good conversation piece.    Represent your profession.  ~Ace
B00NSGBZAM|4|Just perfect for my son
B002NSM8N4|4|The ear warmer is a good fit and does a good job of protecting my ears from the cold New England weather. I've been using this for about a month and so far it's holding up really well. The build quality appears to be good.
B00PADBT1Q|3|A variety of colors but I didn't like the flowers that much. Its still a decent product.
B00R3HDJQ0|5|Looks classy, roomy, and a really great price compared to Nordstrom!
B00EQCBPBQ|2|Very thin and lightweight compared to most jackets of this type, especially the lining.  Was ordered as a birthday gift for husband to replace one from a different manufacturer that was showing wear.  He didn't care for the lightweight feel it and I didn't like all the loose, stringy finish to the sewing quality so it was returned.
B008KXN5KG|2|Although the pleated front looked nice, the rest of the shirt was extremely thin.  The black plastic studs provided were really cheap and may have been place holders rather than intended for actual use.  At least I hope so.  Regardless, the stud/buttonholes were not well sown and became frayed after one usage.  Not a good value for the price.
B00A0ABACW|5|This is a beautiful suit and I am so glad I got this while it was on amazon. I only wish it came in other colors for me.
B009Y9QBYW|5|Since these came packaged as two separate sets, I gave two pairs of socks to both my father and BF for Christmas stocking stuffers, and they loved them!! Very warm, thick, and comfortable, they were both very happy to receive these. I also thought the quality was nice and loved the navy color,however, we've only just received them so... Hope they stay cozy and comfortable! Good buy overall and great bargain, too.
B004NBXZYU|5|excellent product. It is exactly like the photo
B008SEBRB6|4|I really do love both pairs of my suspenders. I bought blue one's first, for cosplay reasons and these seemed like a wonderful buy. I was pleased with the blue ones greatly. Then to update the cosplay, as the character's outfit changed, I bought these with the hopes they would be just as wonderful. They shipped and arrived in only a few days. When I opened them I realized how much thinner the straps were and that one of the clasps had fallen off. I was deeply upset, and fixed the problem as quickly as I could. Since I got them the clasp has fallen off multiple times. In addition, I can't wear them with heavy fabrics or the clasp with come off. But all in all I payed for what I got and my cosplay looks great.
B00A777Y7I|5|It's a skinny tie, and made of good material. I got it for my boyfriend for when we go see ELF live. It's a fun holiday item
B00K3W8Y30|4|Cute,but a bit small.
B005A0LPPO|5|Perfect. Washed the shirt and decal is still good. My daughter loved the.shirt. thank you
B000XH73UU|5|If you are looking for a nice, thick, substantial Tshirt, this is the one for you. I can't stand flimsy, light shirts that you can almost see through. This is definitely a keeper.
B00971ZHSS|3|My torso is a little long compared to the model, so it was a bit short, that didn't matter much to me, however it is very small in the chest area, i don't have LARGE boobs but even mine weren't covered very well.
B0018PWU7C|1|This might be a perfect dress if you don't have an ounce of fat on you... I, on the other hand, have a far from perfect physique.  Unfortunately, It fits like a glove and the slimming shirring at the waist is non-existent.  It just makes me look fat, if not pregnant.  Beware, since it is not returnable. Again, if you are slim, it would probably be great, but as I said, plus sizes beware...
B00CY5OKIM|2|Cute mask. Arrived squished and can't get it back to its original shape.
B00JPZHD3I|4|The straps are not large enough to be a cross body bag, maybe for a child but not an adult. The bag is cute though. I gave this to my mom for Christmas she just uses it as a clutch instead.
B00EY54G2U|5|Great shirt, fit our 4 yr old well and he loves it!
B000YBYU7E|5|gift for a friend, they were very happy
B000C4ZG9E|2|I've washed them once and worn them twice, the thread is unraveling on the wording. I wasn't aware the designs were different either. I like the fit though.
B002O1489C|4|Battery works well.  Seems to take longer to react when turning off camera.  Otherwise, this battery works the same in my Lumix DMC-ZS20 as the stock panasonic battery and has similar or even greater picture taking capacity.
B004TXYBIG|3|we bought the size 5 for our 18month old and it is a bit small.  Granted he is a big boy, but the robe is not very big. It doesnt wrap around much or stay closed to keep his chest covered well. but the sleeves are super long
B008CN77M6|5|The sleeves are a little long, but I love the warmth of the jacket. I've worn it in snowy weather at cold temperatures! It holds up great and is very warm and light. Worth the purchase. Another Columbia favorite!
B00ADJBCW8|5|I got this outfit for my 11 month old daughter and as expected it's a little big on her so she can grow into it. It's very adorable and I can see it being used a lot, however, I wish the inner piece (the white part of the outfit) was either attached or longer. I had to bring it down several times while she was wearing it. Otherwise, I good buy - looks and feels very comfortable. My daughter loves eating it (as expected with an 11 month old). Looks exactly like the picture and got here quickly.
B002TNQAIM|5|This was also a gift for my granddaughter and she really looked just as great with this shirt as well. This onwe was a little dressier than the blue hoodie. They both looked as good on if not better than when I ordered them. Iwas totally pleased and my grandaughter was absolutely thrilled.
B002K1F80E|4|I used it to complement my kid's superman costume and take him treak or treating. We made an awesome pair. It fits very nice, makes your figure look very nice. The boot tops are a good idea, but the don't realy cover the shoe like in the picture.
B00AAWVSJU|4|This is a nice suit. Good price, slightly baggy but ok. I used it for a costume and to grow into though. My kid wears size 14 jeans and is kinda short so this fit a lil baggy at size 14 and long but I liked it looked nice!
B003023K2A|5|Ordered the red and green and blue and red silk scarves. Service was great and delivery was prompt. These scarves are so gorgeous...I was almost afraid to wear them. Almost. At this price, I may have to order more!
B00A93YTFK|5|I looked far and wide for a beautiful silk chemise to replace my beloved one of 25 years that finally fell apart. I was shocked at the price of silk, how hard it is to find in stores, and at the poor quality of most garments. However, I hit the jackpot when I found Julianna Rae's chemise. The workmanship is very high quality, the silk itself is sumptuous, and the fit is spectacular! The color is so flattering and I could not be happier...I recommend this to anyone seeking a lovely silk gown.
B00BIUZHTA|4|Cheap fabric, but worked for my Whatever Happened to Baby Jane costume.
B00QVMNBMK|4|Love it....order another one in a different color.
B00RE2RDP2|4|Great shorts, but they are a little bit big, no to where she cannot wear them, but they are slightly looser in the legs than I like.
B00CJ4NFQG|1|Had 2 months and wore twice and 3 belt loops broke out. Now I cannot return them because it is too late
B001O0EI1C|3|The shorts are fine BUT THE WRONG COLOR WAS SHIPPED.  I ordered NAVY BLUE and received a light blue pair of shorts.  Since gym class was the next day I couldn't return them.<br /><br />I'm not happy that the wrong color was shipped.  I guess if you need a specific color then don't order or be left in the lurch.
B003S9Y0VU|2|I wear a xl so i ordered a 2xl just to be safe and was just way to small and when i put it on one of the buttons just fell off the only nice thing about this was the bow tie
B000P64TWY|5|I was hesitant to order because of some of the bad reviews, but its everything I dreamed it would be!  Its not as small as I had thought and can fit your cellphone and wallet with room to spare.  The handle doesn't quite fit over the shoulder. (But come on, ITS PRADA!) The fabric is outstanding, very soft and incredibly durable.  IT DOES come with a credit card-like certificate of authenticity (in Italian!) in a sleek envelope and is shipped in a Prada dust bag. (Granted its not a fabric one, but who can complain at this price?!)  I inspected this bag inside and out.  Checking all of the (perfect) seams and that the (metal) Prada tags were attached properly.  Its a FANTASTIC deal!
B000OTRFF0|5|I bought this when I didn't want to pay like $70 for a bustier at David's Bridal and it fits perfectly.
B00OOZHNQG|4|Very nice
B0107S7XOK|5|I wear an xl to xxl but the 3xl runs between 1x to 2x, so I had to buy bigger but love the shirt.
B00LPQWOLQ|4|The first shirt I got the writing was very crooked, but you sent another one right away, and it's perfect, thank you so much, love the quickness, you guys are great....Thank you....
B0042AP8G0|4|This is a great value for the price paid, I wear this in my hair and it fits the bill.
B00B66MN9S|1|I was out of town while expecting this package to come in. So when I came back and saw my package and opened it and it wasn't even the bra at all but some ugly work out shirt that I didn't pay $50 for I was extremely pissed and will not be using amazon for anymore of my purchases. Thankyou for being a really unreliable service.
B0000ANHSZ|5|It's great
B006YW50WQ|4|Pros: The wallet is very well built from quality leather and will last a lifetime. I cannot say enough great things about the build quality and the way it looks. Great for reenacting or if you just like to be \\"retro\\". I am giving the product 4 stars based on its quality alone. Good quality leather, good stitching and quite attractive. A+<br /><br />Cons: I was somewhat disappointed by the size of the wallet. It is just too small for what I wanted to use it for... For example, modern sized bank notes do not fit in the wallet without folding them up. So, just imagine trying to cram in a couple of full-sized Civil War era notes!<br /><br />The wallet is 6\\" x 3\\". It has two inside pockets (both are doubles, so four pockets plus a spot behind the top pocket). All of these pockets are roughly 2.5\\" x 5.25\\" and about .5\\" deep.<br /><br />Again... well built, historically accurate... just a little on the small side for me.
B005MZQ7J6|5|Genuine Leather. The compartments are perfect; not too small. I bought this for my husband.  It's larger than his other wallet; though, it isn't too large as not to fit in his pant's pocket.  His credit cards fit securely in the compartments. Not bulky at all. Very sleek,very stylish, very sturdy.  I'm very happy with this purchase.
B0050M3TXS|5|These hair bows were exactly what I needed. I already had the hair bands and these attach perfectly and I was sent an adorable assortment of colors and patterns.
B000TFBO8S|5|It's true!  These socks do not wear out!  I have had ten pairs of these socks for over five years and I wear them every day (because they are so comfortable) and wash them after every wearing.  Until recently I could not tell the new ones from the old ones.  Now the oldest are showing a little wear visually, although they are still just as comfortable as ever.  I have been afraid for years that Wigwam would discontinue these socks just because they can never sell anyone new ones.  I wear them winter and summer.  If you like a heavier, more cushiony sock like I do, look no further.
B00TG0MK4O|5|Loves these!! I just ordered more. Washed up great an I ordered a small like always an it was perfect so order ur regular size
B00D82VZ1K|3|I really wanted to love this coat. The color is as described and fantastic. The fit was just strange to put it best, very awkward, uncomfortable... Sigh returning
B005CSOHDG|3|These are not as good as the Fruit of the Loom pair I have
B009Y675MW|4|This corset fits well and is very comfortable to wear.  I will say it was a little tricky getting it on by myself the first two times.
B005IDM8JA|3|I might be sending them back. They are very tight in the waste. Reviews said that they ran big so I ordered to match that. I should have just went to the store and tried them on.
B009EQKDK8|1|No tag, but instead a sticker?! NEVER seen that before. Very thin material adult XL more like child's Lg. Inferior product.<br /> I am Completely unsatisfied with this purchase. WHats worse is it took about 3 weeks to receive.
B00SWIAL24|3|Went with reviews and ordered appropriately
B006LHN0A8|5|My husband was very skeptical when I purchased these. He'd been complaining that nothing fit right. His boxer briefs would ride up and bunch during his 12 hour shifts. He works in a very hot kitchen, which made him very... uncomfortable.<br /><br />These came very promptly and he decided to give them a try. HE ACTUALLY CALLED ME FROM WORK to tell me how well these fit. The only problem is now he has decided that he ONLY wants these underpants and now I have to replace every pair he owns. So, be prepared to invest in an underwear wardrobe change, because apparently these boxer briefs are the real deal.
B00OJ82VFQ|5|I Love them very much
B00E0I7PX8|3|I bought this for my teenage daughter who is a US Medium. I had to buy this in XXL  in order to fit her arms but made some alterations for a perfect fit around the waist as per the model picture. Otherwise it would just be straight and shapeless. I gave it 3 stars as it looks just like the pic on her and it comes with the scarf too.
B00N4VR29Y|4|Nice blazer and nice fit everywhere, but sleeves.  Sleeves are too short.
B00U8Q3WTW|5|Nice addition to the wardrobe!
B007PESS58|5|Good undies for my little guy.  I could buy undies at Wal-Mart but I am a prime customer.  Good quality undies you'd expect from Fruit of the Loom.
B0006U68C8|5|fit great
B008OC8KLW|3|Leg size is actually 31 or 32
B00FDUE3U0|4|per amazon, 4 stars indicate &#34;i like it&#34; and 5 stars indicate &#34;i love it&#34; - i like it! but its a bit too heavy & hot for me to love it.. (i live in the tropics) ..  although i would buy it again because of its natural cotton fabric! and because it is good quality & well-made .. (and a wonderful, rich color: i got it in purple) .. plus is easy to launder (be sure to close the velcro tabs when washing).  and! thank you to the company for the *very good customer service*.
B00ACIH2A6|4|A little smaller than I'd like. But they are otherwise very comfortable.  Nice colors and a very good value. Hopefully they last.
B001M5ELFM|3|It was a little bit small!
B00FKPCC5Q|5|My daughter loves this shirt.
B00IIZ6DZA|5|new favorite tankini.  provides enough support for the girls
B00PJPD5YE|4|Soft material, very comfortable to wear. I would say that it will not suit for vigorous activities like running, circuit training as it does not provide good support, but perfect for moderate and light activities like yoga, pilates. Very good for this price.
B00GFZW944|5|I ordered this at 28 weeks pregnant and wish I had ordered it sooner. It is comfy, looks good, and I finally feel a bit pulled together. I debated about what size to order, they say order your pre-pregnancy size but I have already gained a lot of weight so far - particularly in my butt and thighs, so I wasn't sure - but I did and it fit great. I am 5'8 and a size 2 pre-pregnancy, 30+ pounds later the 2 fits and I think will fit the rest of my pregnancy too. Overall very flattering. I ended up ordering a second one in another color directly from the Seraphine website (cheaper than amazon).
B007P4F4F0|5|I wore this delightful visor for a Halloween costume this year and it fit beautifully. I'm very sensitive to hats (large head for a girl) and tend to get headaches easily, however, this visor was extremely soft and comfortable on my head. I was able to wear it on two different occasions without any aches or pains. The velcro seems to stretch far enough and stays in place. Great purchase!
B00QEUL7ZC|5|Love this dress. I wore it to a black tie event and received numerous compliments. The fit was perfect. Plan to order another, in red, for our company Christmas party.
B0085TFAXK|4|It's a warm hoodie but the sizes run big. I wear a 3x in pretty much every brand of sweaters that i use and this fits like a 4x. Very warm and comfortable though. You won't be disappointed
B004OVELDS|5|We got two pairs of these for our Dad (79 years young) and a horrible launderer...he washes everything in one load no matter what the color and etc. They looked brand new even after he washed them!!! :-) The size runs exact. They are a nice medium thick material and soft. They are perfect for northern Indiana winters.
B00QC5QDK8|1|This dress is to small even I did order the XXL.Material is cheap , recommend don't buy .I returned and  have not hear from the company If the dress has been received .
B00AOJGPRO|5|Breezy, comfortable, very nice looking. Bought another pair at Macy's. The only problem is they run tight, so if you're a 34 order a 36.
B00QSEN6TE|5|Ran a little small. It fits my daughter, but just barely. She will only be able to use it for this summer.
B002ZG4VCA|5|Love this Barely There style (We've Gotcha Covered).  It is full coverage, comfortable underwire, and no ridiculous excess padding.  The Amazon price is excellent.  The choices for A cups these days is extremely limited. My thanks to Barely There.
B0009PX7YW|5|Love the way this feels and fits.  Purchased the matching robe to go with it.  Very comfortable.
B00HUQ6PW4|4|These shirts are TINY!  Definitely a &#34;junior fit&#34; rather than women's.  I ordered at 2XL for my tall size 12-14 (in ladies) daughter and it fits tightly around her middle.  The length is great.  She adores the shirt though, so I plan on washing in cold water and hanging to dry.  The logo is a bright gold metallic and she has gotten many, many compliments on it.  Shipping took about 3-4 weeks to get to the states.
B00IZC7FQW|1|Bought what was supposed to be a US 12-14, I couldn't even get this over my head.  Super thin material, no give at all.
B000UAPOHY|5|Love the wonderbra, great fit and feel. Hope they never discontinue this model. I am typically a 34B but with this bra it's best to order up a cup size, 34c fits like a glove!
B00I3JLOZK|4|They fit fine, wish there was just a bit more padding.
B00AHOQ9VS|2|I love the sleep n play zip outfits, so we decided to buy this 2-pack from Amazon for my 4-month old.  The material is soft and zippers make diaper changes incredibly quick.<br /><br />Please note that the appliqué on the navy outfit will begin to peel after the first wash, before your child has even worn it.  I wash gentle cycle and dry on low and noticed 2 corners peeling as soon as I pulled it out of the dryer.  The white, sports outfit does not appear to have any issues, as it does not have the same appliqué feature.
B00HSR5RNS|2|Very thin!!!
B006HYPRXS|5|My boyfriend loved this belt great price
B001CDHZSE|5|Best fit and finish in a traditional length tennis short.<br />Deep pockets in the front for extra tennis balls, zippered back pocket for keys, etc.<br />Ordered more!
B00ISI67NK|4|like
B007HSCKQK|5|Absolutely love the shirt. It does run small but that is expected for junior sizing.  It is extremely soft and has a little stretch to it as well.  I get so many compliments on it and it has worn very well through numerous washings. I would order this brand again for sure.
B0002CA1VY|5|In a nutshell, every bit of these shoes is engineered for comfort and style.  Mephisto did not miss a beat.  The air cushioning system is unbelievably comfortable and well disguised.  The style is also classy yet simple.  I originally thought I overpaid for these shoes, but now I'm sure I got a great deal
B00H8AIMZ0|4|Works very well for such a small box. Has only six slots, but are very easy and convenient to access.
B006AEX4TE|5|This hat is a great value. It is well made, fits  great.Best hat since I bought an Aegian fisherman's cap many years ago.
B001JBNDM6|5|It is perfect that I am looking for.  It is really comfortable.  So I would recommend it to everyone else.
B004W114XA|4|This is a good hat. But is just a touch softer than I really like so a little extra care must be taken not to crease it accidentally.
B00B77X368|5|These fit my son past 3 months! I liked how they had the elastic at the ankle. It helped keep the pants down.
B00H3BPM5C|5|Nice
B004L00QZO|5|great shirt.received it quick,decent price.amazon is the best.thin lizzy forever.i love this orange shirt.buy one.next im getting the jailbreak shirt!!
B001HTZ134|5|The leggings feel great! They are just as I'd hoped. I've washed them several times and they are holding up just fine. They are a little bit long for me since I'm only 5'3&#34; so perhaps an XS would've been better, but that's not a big deal. I love they way they fit and feel.
B00CDC2TZC|5|I was hesitant at first, when I was picking out a style, because the charcoal one didn't have an actual model underneath the shirt. But, when it got here and I tried it on, I immediately fell in love.<br /><br />It hugs my chest enough to show off my curves, but hangs just loose enough to hide any extra curves I don't want people to see. I'm a mother, I have a small pooch on my lower stomach, and I have wide hips. This keeps everything hidden and is flattering.<br /><br />It's super comfortable, the price is reasonable, and the material is fantastic. I plan on buying more. :)
B00ARDD66A|5|excellent article very comfortable as the seller described it
B004WI2CHK|2|the jeans were a terrible fit for me. The thighs fit fine but the waist was much too large and flared out into almost bell bottoms<br />i'm 5'5 and 135 with a pear shape and these did not do anything for me
B009YQ5YLQ|5|These fit perfectly.  Comfy all day.
B00CY3ZGX2|4|The knit is skin tight even in a large, and I wear a 34 B bra and weigh only 137 pounds with most of it being in my thighs and hips. Also, since I'm only 5'2&#34;, it comes to my knee. I have to wear it with leggings or a longer skirt to make it look right.
B00JFCYM26|1|First off, they sent the wrong size, and the pants were way too small. The fabric is very thin, and seems to be of poor quality. I sent them back.
B0070QLQ6O|5|Looks awesome!
B000UL5YCS|3|ok
B009EQOHEG|5|This is a comfy, good quality Tshirt that looks great. Highly recommended.<br /><br />It's a perfect fit for me: 183cm 75kg (skinny/sporty)
B003VXO4IM|4|They arrived in a small plastic bag and they had a very strong plastic odor to them which I wasn't thrilled about.  They appear to be brand new though, and I like the material and the color, so hopefully tossing them in the wash will remove the smell.  I wear size 8 pants and the size 6's fit me, I wouldn't go larger than that either as I think they might stretch out.  I like how smooth they are and airy.  Overall they are good, but after shipping costs I think I might have rather just grabbed a 5 pack from Costco or something and paid half the price for more... as I'm not completely sold on the 'better quality' of the other types I've seen in stores.
B00IRBUZK4|3|Still love it
B007M609HE|5|I really like Levi's pants. Once you know the type (501; 511, 508 etc.) and it's size, you will be Ok! It was just the way I expected!...................
B0087676MO|5|I love the coat, it's very stylish and well made.  I ordered a medium to be sure it would fit over bulky sweater, however it's still a little loose.  If you typically wear a medium you may want to consider ordering a small.
B00JMPUA22|5|Great quality, jack a bit small if busty
B0010EG85Q|5|Very good shirt. Very sturdy and looks Good
B0083J7EP4|5|This is a wonderful hat made of real palm, so it can be re-shaped however you like, and water/rain will not destroy it. Many hats these days that claim to be palm leaf are really just grasses, and fall apart/unravel the second they get wet. Not so with this beauty. She sits high on the crown, and she is incredibly well made, with immaculate attention to detail. The only bad thing I can even say about this hat is that is does run larger than stated.
B00KBU2D18|5|favorite light sweater, flattering, soft and comfortable. perfect for summer nights
B00KQF4QKY|4|Elegant and comfortable.
B00N9AU1QQ|1|This product is a fine dress if you're looking for something simple. However I wore it all day today and it stained my bra red and my arm pits are bright red. I first thought I was having an allergic reaction them realized that it was the dress. Not wearing it again.
B00BN1MCME|4|3 month old 13lb boy fits tight. hes in the 90% of his age group so big boy..thought getting the 3-6 month would give him room. but he really needs 6-9 month.
B00B1AOP4U|4|I got them for pajama pants for an upcoming cruise. They're a bit thin, but soft and will serve the purpose.
B00LH063BM|5|Nice suit !!
B00NCSUH3W|3|This is a really cool organizer.  I'm looking forward to using it on my next vacation.  : )
B000K1DECK|4|I received this as a gift for Christmas and spent HOURS and HOURS trying to work the first puzzle in the booklet. When I came home, I entered the puzzle *as printed* into pappocom's sudoku program (where I play most of my puzzles). The program rated it an impossible puzzle: there's no solution. Even as I continued to enter in solutions I'd found, it was still unsolvable. Not only that, the box says there are 100 puzzles in the booklet; mine printed 40 grids, 20 of which had EVERY number plugged in... so of the \\"100\\", I'm missing 60, 20 are solved, and at least one is impossible. That leaves me with 19 new puzzles to work.    My only other complaint is that they only give you 9 miniature numbers (to substitute for pencil marks) and I wish I had more... sometimes, there are more than 9 possible locations for a number as I'm working the puzzle!    Aside from those two issues, one of which is easily ignored by supplementing the game with new puzzle books, and the other might be solved by seeing if I can order more of JUST the numbers...  This is neat. It's a new way to work some of the harder puzzles, and it might make this phenomenon available to other people (kinesthetic learners, you can actually physically manipulate things here!).
B0036WU7SE|4|My 4 year old son loves this backpack, but when it arrived it had a horrible smell. I had to air it out for 2 weeks outside.
B00OQ0BAXQ|1|Would leave zero stars if I could. Ordered an XL. (I wear L) and these would literally fit a child of 9 or 10 years old. Very cheaply made. Material is ver thin. So disappointed  because these looked so cute online.
B0002GTFNU|5|When I was pregnant I was very excited about this bouncer.  My nephew loved his.  He would sleep in it when he was an infant and hang out in it when his mom would be cooking or taking a shower.  Well when I got my son home he wasn't too thrilled.  He didn't want to sleep in it and he was too young for anything else.  I thought it was a waste of money.  But when he turned about 1 1/2 - 2 months he started loving it.  He still only likes to play in it, the toys are great, I even added some of my own.  It is great when you need 15 minutes just to take a shower.  He is now 5 months and still loves playing in it.
B00918XKV8|5|I got them in the lavender 16 inch, and I like them so much now I am ordering them in the 28 inch chocolate as I need coverage from my ankles up over my knees. So I am giving the 16 inch pair to my Mom as she had a bad break in her ankle and needs warmth to help her with arthritis and she will look pretty in the lavender. These are made well once washed they went back fairly close to the original shape and I had stretched them over my knees. Im very happy with them, you do have to pull them up now and then but as it goes with leg warmers. 5'5 180lbs
B00K7M806M|3|Nice, but too small I normally wear a Small 4-6 ordered a medium after reading the reviews. Should have ordered a Large!
B00GBJHRF0|4|Size was too small but the jeans are beautiful and very well made. Order correct size just waiting to arrive.
B004UPV1I6|5|My daughter love this blanket. Bought it for her when she was 3 and she still loves it! I would buy it for any little girl. Really soft too.
B009G0OO7U|5|LOVE! Got it for my first serious cosplay. It is so freaking worth it. It fits very small however so just be aware to buy GOOOOOD wig caps before and and somewhere to hang it since it is a lot of hair. But for the price, it's amazing quality. I got asked if it was my real hair!!
B000P9GAPK|2|don't like it<br />uncomfortable and tight<br />haven't noticed a good support<br />my usual 36B feels like 34A<br />sending it back
B005OLBZR2|2|It wasn't what I expected.
B00RYPAV7G|4|super cute and the bottoms fit but the top is too small i wear a DD might have to return it
B008AYJKYK|4|Buttons were a big hit. Impressed with my son because he gave each of his brothers one for their backpacks. One classmate repeatedly rips off pin from my sons backpack shoulder straps. They are easy to attach the face back to as the pin portion stays secure. Would have been good to have Linderman (spelling) or zombie rather than a grass block but hey, that's just my feeling.<br />Over-priced but unable to find elsewhere for less.
B00DJAXX8Y|5|Great, my husband loves it!
B004MOCWYM|2|These were good the first few times I used them, but they exploded and leaked when I traveled internationally. I'm not a huge fan of these bottles.
B00TASLQEW|4|I bought this shirt to swim in on days I need more coverage than my bikini provides or just don't feel like applying a million pounds of sunscreen. The shirt fits me just like it looks on the model, it has a round neck and a bracelet length sleeve. I normally wear a small or a medium and I went with the medium so it wouldn't be tight across my squishy middle. Floats up a little in the pool but not very much. The only significant difference from the picture is the color, it is a bit more green in person.
B00AGLLB8S|5|I can't take it off.  So comfy.  I am 5'5 200Lbs and it's huge on me.  Best bath robe ever.
B00062NFHW|5|I received these as a gift from my wife for Christmas, My favorite style and brand ! When these wear out I will purchase more.
B005444MWO|5|Well-made shirt. My husband loved it.
B002M62RI8|5|It was so soft and comfy compared to a cheaper wiry one I had gotten earlier.<br />I love the swish factor, and can't wait to pair it with my skirt my sister sewed for me!!<br />Now I just need one in navy, white and red.
B001AWCDKC|1|While I didn't expect much for the price, I expected it to appear more similar to the photo.  Wig was uneven, much shorter and looked nothing like photo.  I do not recommend it.  I have purchased Rubie's Costume wigs before and had no issues.
B00GV4VVE8|4|Awesome product came earlier than i expected it fit perfectly and i absolutely love it, its amazing everyone should get it
B00R11Q4L0|3|should be able to purchase top and bottom separately
B00GNETDSC|5|what I expected
B00BWW5B54|4|The shirt looks like the picture, wears like any other t-shirt - not exactly rocket science to figure that out.
B008L422BW|5|I combined these stays with magnets (1/4&#34; magnets), and they are prefect for holding my collars down.  My collars also don't slide into my jacket leaving me with a flat look.  Great product.
B005WYYZ5A|3|Not well made.  Or sewn for that matter.  The flower part came off very easily and the thread runs loose.  Overpriced based on quality.
B005ML7I52|3|very good
B000GISWJM|4|My item arrived on time and the ism itself was great. The only problem was that I have thicker legs so it just seemed a bit small, but the quality was great.
B0001YS502|5|Fits as expected.  Material is thinner than other Carhartt shorts, but comfortable for outdoor summer work.  Washes well.
B00NM7G6I8|5|Got this for a secret Santa present and my friend loved it!
B0093FLKPM|4|My boyfriend's brother asked for this for Christmas and he likes it a lot.<br />The material is very nice, not cheap. I liked the smaller size option, it made it more affordable.
B00BBKGMPU|5|The material is soft and comfortable and performs as advertised.  The fit was as expected with the added bonus of a longer body which helps to keep the t-shirt from bunching up like many others.
B000SKLT52|5|I ordered these for me (size 11.5 mens), but my wife (size 10 womens) likes them so much she has been stealing them.  I'm going to need to order more.  They are comfy and just long enough to stay above the shoe line without slipping into my sneakers.
B005CW06X2|5|Snug but not tight. Keeps things where you want.
B00LYTE05M|5|I love this shirt every time I wear it I get a ton of compliments!!!
B000N4MWKE|4|I purchased this item for a Hinata cosplay. I am a size Large and was nervous about the fit, but once I tried it on, I was happy that it fit fine! If you are bigger than a Large, I would suggest finding another size; the arms may become tight or leave marks. The only issue was that it rolls/slides up, which gets annoying. Overall, it was exactly what I was looking to complete my costume and I am pleased with the purchase.
B00STVFVGA|5|Nice quality shirt. Fits nice and is soft.
B0074651A2|5|Wore it to the beach was comfortable
B009NN8G5G|5|My Grand daughter who lives in Wyoming said it keeps her warm and she loves it. Said the quality is great and I am thinking of getting one for my daughter and myself.<br />I would very much recommend it!
B00Q3LQOFK|4|Like these but the hang a little low on my hips. Fit nicely to by body.
B001FRCMOE|4|It was perfect for someone's gift, except it arrived few days later than what i expected.  other than that, it was great for everything.
B00MPW47UU|1|If you get an extra large, it should fit someone who is 6'1 195 lbs.
B00EVH7QH8|4|The hoodie was delivered before it was expected which was wonderful.  Have had an issue with the stiching on one top corner and one bottom corner of the pocket but was easily repaired.
B007MMSXZ8|4|Child loves
B00FRFA6SY|5|What can I say?  It's a hat and I like it very much.
B00K47YY88|5|This is a great dress :) I love it.
B00CFU7JR0|4|This tank thing is so cute, I love it!  I ordered three of these things and gave one to my mom...Im five feet tall and about 120lbs...it's hangs great, but it's kinda big around the armpt...and it opens wide there. I'd have to wear another tank or sports bra underneath that way my bra is not on full display. Otherwise, I love this!
B001BQ1F9M|5|Awesome jacket, i would recommend it to anyone, great price for this product!
B00KHXIOW6|4|MY SON IS A BIG HARRY POTTER FAN AND LOVED THESE PANTS WHEN HE SAW THEM AND HIS HAVING A BALL WEARING THEM!  MY ONLY SUGGESTION WOULD BE TO POSSIBLY OFFER SOME PANTS LIKE THESE IN KIDS SIZES AS WELL AS MENS-MY SON IS A KID AND THEY'RE A LITTLE LONG AND BIG BUT HE LOVES THEM SO MUCH HE'S WEARING THEM ANYWAY!
B0038JJ61Y|3|wear and wash a couple of times and they won't stay up without duct tape. 3 stars is a gift.
B0069KGUAY|1|I read the reviews and thought this was going to be perfect for what I needed.  The XL will probably hold a C cup perfectly but this is definitely NOT for bigger chested women.  Sending this back!
B003KGIZ58|5|Robes are plenty long and thick great to go and come from hot tub in. no towel needed with these robes
B00NF3TRZS|3|These are HUGE on my 2 year old's hands - he is almost 3 but these will fit for the next couple of years.  I bought these because they were designated for 2-3 year olds - I would say this is more for a 4-6 year olds hands.
B007RGCYYK|5|Great buy
B00P8M1360|5|Was very excited to get and wear it
B006CJ7IEO|2|Shirt fits good but if you want to wear it more than once you are out of luck!  Not one but two of these shirts fell apart after one wear. Amazon was great to help with the issue though.
B00OK18GAQ|3|My daughter is tall for her age and has been wearing 18 month old clothing before she turned a year old.  The pants are much longer than pants from Gymboree or Carters for the same age range.  The socks are cute as is the onesie (which seems to fit the same as other brands).  The colors are not too bright and the price was quite affordable when I purchased this.  However, the orange pants had a rather large hole in the seam.  It's easy to fix, but I shouldn't have to fix brand new clothing.  This is the third time clothing I've ordered from Amazon has had a hole in it or some other defect.  Makes me wonder if this is not outlet shopping and that I should just start to expect lower quality.
B00DNK1NC8|4|These shorts are great as described. Very happy. I wish Amazon would allow briefer reviews I would do the more often.
B0002UR7PY|5|Best dancing pants ever! I just love them! I would like if they can offer more colors and models.
B00C9PBVSO|1|I LOVE these jeans!! However, I have to give the ones I received ONE START for the following reason. Although these are advertised on Amazon as 518 Superlow Bootcut Levi's, the ones I received were NOT!! They were 518 Bootcut jeans and they fit differently than the Superlow cut! After receiving them and trying them on and them not fitting comfortably, I looked inside at the label and low and behold they were NOT the Superlow bootcut 518s! I thought it must have been a mistake so I put in to have them replaced. However, when I got the replacements, they were the EXACT same WRONG product! I am NOT happy about this as the 518 Superlow Bootcut jeans are the only style that I've found that fit comfortably. I am afraid to try to order them again as I'm guessing they'd send the incorrect product again! If these are NOT the 518 Superlow Bootcut Jeans, then AMAZON needs to CHANGE the description of the item on the Amazon website!  I've ordered several pairs of these from Amazon in the past and never had this happen. (Maybe someone didn't check the labels and put them in the wrong bin?)
B00J8A75U6|3|Per the other reviews, item is flimsy and cheaply made.  Sleeves are not finished and it does run a bit small.  Color is nice and it is 100% cotton which is what I wanted
B005HJ7G60|5|Soft and comfortable.good fit
B00APFE3L2|4|I love it, it's beautiful as expected. The only problem is the ironing :(
B001DNYXH4|5|Arrived quickly and looked like picture. The scarf is sewed onto the shirt. Head scarf was nice but only printed one side.  Was a hit at the party! Its made as a costume shirt and so don't expect it to last forever and so have realist expectation. I would recommend to a friend.
B00CUBCGZY|4|They are very thin but colors are  as in the picture
B00T40YBNY|5|absolutely BEAUTIFUL
B00OEJMUNS|4|Gorgeous dress just very big in the torso chest part
B004IMANXK|5|I'm a dedicated fan of Gold-Toe socks - for the quality, the fit, the style/pattern selections - everything about<br />them always quite pleased ---  and ordering thru Amazon is a great experience --  everything happens quite<br />efficiently --  I always 'shop Amazon' ---
B00NDJ82M8|5|this is exactly the color I needed for my wedding and went great with my dress
B00BEUN8EU|5|I like finding uncommon band shirts and this one fits the bill. First Pink Floyd shirt I've bought in fact because I've mainly only seen the album cover shirts which are cool but everyone has. The material feels great too
B00CR98J9Q|5|It was a gift so I'm hoping it will fit as expected…It is pretty and we love it!!
B00FXPS1N0|5|Good shirt for hot days,slightly loose  fit is very comfortable. This shirt dries pretty quick when you perspire heavily
B00HLFXQM6|1|Beautiful in the picture, however this bracelet fell apart not long after I put it on. I thought maybe it was just mine, but I bought 3 of them and the same thing happened to my sister and friend. Inexpensive for a reason.
B0032Z7TKO|5|What a pretty birthday dress! Fabric is soft enough, execution is ok - dots are cut on edges and sometimes don't match - but colors and shape are very close to the image used to sell this product.<br /><br />I certainly recommend the dress
B00DHCZUIU|5|can't beat the price, for this quality hat
B00DUF9WT2|2|This bra is the right size, but the wrong shape for me. The cups are slightly pointy and wall-eyed. If that's the right shape for you, then great, but be aware that if it isn't then this won't fit how you want it to.
B00QWQHRQQ|4|I'm very tall (6'3&#34;) and wished it was a bit longer
B00755FVCU|4|I waited four years until I could get this shirt. I love it, and now I get to relive the concert every time I wear it!  :)
B004SW9PBQ|2|I like the style of these pants and they seem to be made of good material.  However, they are really tight.  I am a somewhat slim guy and have regularly worn 32x32 size for years.  These are uncomfortably tight around the wasted and upper legs.  So much so they are hardly maneuverable in.  Which, is not ideal for work pants.  Was a bit disappointed and after ordering another pair of dickies work pants of the same size, found the complete opposite.  They are huge.  Dickies really needs to work on they're sizing.
B00N9FJ702|5|My daughter-in-law loves these...said it's one of the softest fleece items she's ever worn.  There were no delivery issues. I would order from them again.
B0016HUPKQ|4|This is a very nice tie I am very happy with this purchase though the color was a little more yellow than the original photo it still looks very nice and I love the texture
B00ENGRZP0|5|Great fit and well made T-shirt. Will Buy another.
B00AWJNVDW|5|The costume fits fine and is made of good material. It has the king kai symbol can't wait for Halloween.
B007C4GJJ8|3|My two-month-old son has large feet and wasn't fitting into socks intended for 0-3 months babies. I ordered these in the 3-6 months size and these are just as small if not smaller than the socks I already had! I almost wonder if the 6-9 month size would be too small, too. Other than the size, the socks seem fine. At least they were cheap enough that they weren't worth the trouble to send back.
B00FA0EIPS|5|oh this item is so nice fits good i am so happy.
B00S7RWB50|5|Looks great and it's really noticeable
B00GYQ9NAM|5|Runs large though
B00BUDCN0Q|5|They are great and comfortable. They are also very stylish and cool as the masks are supposed to be capes.
B0077IJV1C|5|Great high quality leather belt. Good fit and fun style. The leather is thick and has that awesome leather smell.
B000EHKQ8K|5|The product I paid for was exactly as they explained and actually came a little faster than I expected. It was in great condition, no wears or tears, and I bought at a great low costs. Love the item and the company behind it
B00TGB1BN4|2|pills with washing  :(
B00EDODMA4|5|Gave as a gift and nephew loved it.
B00B2B9ZHA|5|These are Great!!  ---  Just what I was looking for... covers the foot just right and is soft on the skin and warm!  I am Glad they do not have allot of Plastic on the bottom of them - as I use them to keep my feet warm in a winter bed and too keep my feet warm if I take a nap on top of the bed!<br /><br />I tried wearing foot socks as sleepers and it just does not work for me they get so dirty walking on the floor and with out fail you step in to a puddle of something and your foot gets icky and wet... Yuk...<br /><br />I can't stand that... and I do not like putting filth into my washing machine and getting its inards filthy.  For people who want to walk around the floor - they should also have a regular slipper with a normal sole on it to do that.<br /><br />I've tried lots of various sock slippers and these are some of the best I have owned.  The company selling them is nice and helpful as well as I contacted them and asked that they be shipped as soon as possible as I bought one pair for me and one pair for my sick Mom... they kindly responded.<br /><br />A Big Thumbs UP on this one!
B00BTHPKIU|5|I purchased two of these shirts a month ago as weapons in my ongoing war against the extreme \\"farmer's tan\\" I get every summer (not to mention the abnormal mole biopsies). Since then, I've spent a LOT of time in the sun at peak hours. I've worn the shirts for everything from gardening to backpacking to attending a major league baseball game to a long car ride (several hours in the driver's seat with the sun baking your forearms is no joke). My observations:<br /><br />1. The shirts are soft and surprisingly lightweight. I'd expected to sweat with long sleeves in the sun - in fact, I ordered both shirts in white to help prevent overheating - but I was consistently comfortable. After wearing them for hours at a time in hot weather, I wouldn't hesitate to buy more in dark colors. I also like the casual athletic style.<br /><br />2. It's so nice not to have to slather sunscreen all over myself throughout the day, nor to have to scrub off the residue at night. I expect to actually save money using these shirts as opposed to buying the dozens of tubes of EWG-approved sunscreen it would take to adequately protect my skin all summer (why DO the safest sunscreens always come in the smallest packages and cost the most?).<br /><br />3. As other reviewers have noted, these shirts are generously sized. I usually wear an extra-large because I like my shirts pretty loose. I got these in a large and they fit like an extra-large would. That said, if you're not the kind of person who monitors the dryer and promptly removes delicate clothing before it gets too hot, you might want to order a size up. I left mine in the dryer for the full cycle and now they're skin-tight. I'll still use them for yard work, but now I know to order the next size up.<br /><br />Bottom line: a comfortable, good-looking shirt that does its job admirably. A coupon for 15% off my next order from Coolibar was attached to the packing slip, and I'll definitely be using it to order more shirts.
B00DR6UGNU|1|Buckle is good. But leather strap is just ok. It has a stiching with excess thread hanging loose. I was not really impressed with belt. It is a more hype than substance.
B00FS15HWC|1|I really love the look of them, but they turned out to be the cheapo leggings with the velvety skulls ironed on. One skull is like on the side of my knee vs on my knee. I ended up giving them to my daughter,<br />Sizes run way small
B0002TOZ00|5|I've purchased these socks for years from a local store, then they quit carrying them. I love them because I wear boots & don't like when my socks would slide down, these stay up!
B00FOBS70A|5|Great socks, very happy with the fit, color and price.
B0051U182S|5|I never had a pair of socks that felt that good , it is on my Christmas wish list thank you carhartt !!!
B001ZSMUXQ|5|I purchased this tie as a Christmas present for a friend.  However, after seeing the quality of the item I might order another one for my boyfriend.  I wouldn't mind him dressing like Jim Halpert every once in a while.  This tie is really an excellent deal - quality fabric and a classic design at a surprisingly low price.
B009WUJ0BE|5|I got a new bathrobe for Christmas and my 3 year old decided she had to have one.  I let her pick the color/print.  Now she loves putting on her robe and feels like a big girl.  She puts it on over her pajamas if she's feeling a bit chilly.  The robe is thick and cozy, and seems like good quality.  It has a inside tie to keep the robe together, and then the belt on the outside too.
B000JIMFT2|5|Best nursing bra on the market now! Super comfortable and does not slip around like some of the other fold over brands. I have a bunch and these are always my go to for this style.
B00KREAU5Y|5|don't write well in English
B009BKWE9U|5|Thought it would be a litttle bigger, but it fits perfectly into the purse I have.  I am very glad I got this!
B00EL6U26G|4|I thought it was going to look different but the girlie still like it so I guess I cant complain...
B003AYUGDY|3|way too small so I orders another on in a larger size
B00HNKWSEQ|5|My daughter is four years old is 105 cm tall<br /><br />Wearing a slightly smaller number of estimates next year on outgrown<br /><br />But still very good clothes, my daughter likes to wear do not want to take off
B0086F0JI4|5|Coat fit my grandson very well.  Main problem with this order was that it took 14 days for me to receive it. Not sure what the problem was. I do know that ii took 10 days to leave the facility so not a problem with the carrier
B006P0CR32|5|I was looking for a scarf which includes a certain shade of hot pink. The view of this<br />scarf online was accurate in depicting the color and it has turned out to be exactly what<br />I need for a special outfit.
B003CU4DM6|4|My 15 year old son wore this while answering the door for trick or treaters.  Small children loved it.  Older kids thought it was funny.
B00N9UDUF0|1|Shape is not right.
B001OCPZG2|5|These shorts are in my go to rotation. Comfortable and look good. The pockets are deep enough that your wallet and phone will not fall out.
B003ZN93O8|4|Really comfortable and has pretty good support for a bra without underwire. I am quite busty but feel comfortable wearing this in public, unlike several I have tried from maternity stores. Worth the price as it is way more supportive than others I have tried. Easy to nurse with, and washes well
B0002TVN96|5|I am extremely  happy  with this product. !
B00KXQ7ERI|4|Fit is a bit weird but I like them
B00EBRULAW|5|Would recommend this product.
B00JPJBZ38|5|Washes well
B00GAUWVKG|4|Wish it came in XL-Large but oh well cold water was and hang dry no dryer for this shirt, but love it anyway
B001E5VT0U|1|It was extremely large and bushy.  The beard had little straps that attached to the ears, but they weren't sewn on right. This caused the beard not to fit correctly, very lopsided. Didn't have time to send it back to get a replacement, so we had to improvise.
B00JFDEA8Q|4|Cute shirt, good quality, just a little smaller than I expected.
B00DG7ES84|5|I love the material....it doesn't rub away the color between your thighs like Jersey knit or cotton.
B004G09NHG|5|Perfect fit. Extremely comfortable.  Switching from my old brand. Better price too.
B000K2OFK4|5|I have a couple of other Alpaca shawls but this one is special. It is so soft and luxurious I know it will end up being my favorite. It's still in the 70s-80s here so I haven't yet had the opportunity to do more than try it on and show it off. Can't wait for fall/winter!
B005900LWS|4|There is a very comfortable and pretty. I Like It the cloth, colour and design. Definitely recommend them for all.
B00RJMLMRW|5|I really do like these gloves even though they a bit tighter than large at first.. They have stretched just enough to make them really comfortable and for looking so thin, they are actually quite warm.
B00GKGR7UE|5|This is exactly what I was looking for, with a little extra in my middle from having to csections back to back I needed something more substantial than a regular bikini bottom to wear with my tankini top (also by Anne Cole). But at the same time I was not willing to settle for the swim dresses or less stylish swimsuits that are geared towards older women or mothers (I'm 27). This is PERFECT! Would buy more in other colors if I could find them...
B0073WWQ82|1|The tube tops were very cheaply made,...see through... I returned the item... i would not recommend or buy this product again.
B0061HOVTM|1|I bought these pants for my husband for work. He did not wear them for the summer because they are quite thick. He put them on this morning and they were tight and too short. He wears a 38x32 which is what they are tagged. They were up around his ankles. To say the least, I am now stuck with them because the return time has passed. I will not order pants for him on line any more. Not worth it! Very disappointed!!!
B00KCG9QDO|5|quick ship good fit
B000RIW0DA|4|Nothing fancy but a good value. It's a good elf tunic if you already have a hat and shoes.
B00EOM8EE4|5|Good quality and true size.
B0095XYJMI|2|I ordered a s/m they send me a large and the shirt does not look like the picture the leopard had yellow and orange in it i am not please wit this at all
B00E1S6PZ6|1|OMG! Don't waste your time ordering or money purchasing this dress. It's awful, once I took it out the bad I didn't even have to try it on; the material is very thin and cheap looking. The length of the dress does not go to the floor and the thread was already coming a loose from the seam, please don't be fooled by the photo; I couldn't wait to send this dress back. I was very, very disappointed... and I will not be purchasing anything else from the company that made this dress.....
B00IWVDLC8|3|I like the material and it's weight - just what I was looking for.  Love the color.  But.....the tie goes around well below my hips - not what I was looking for.  The pockets hang so low I have to hike up the robe to use them.  I am 5'6&#34; and long-waisted.
B005QZO4QK|4|I was looking for some underwear in a slippery fabric to wear when exercising in hot weather, when cotton panties give me rashes.  These are great for that; they're almost frictionless.  I have learned, however, that I can't use them when I need a pad or panty liner, because those don't stick well to this fabric.<br /><br />As another commenter noted, after wearing them a couple of times, I have little snags on the upper back. Looks just like the butt of my swim suit when I was a kid, after I'd sat on the edge of the pool a few times ;)  If that kind of thing bothers you, probably best to avoid these.<br /><br />I also love that these dry quickly, so I'll be using them for travel. I washed a pair in the sink and rolled them in a towel so that they weren't dripping. Hung them over a door knob, and they were dry by morning.
B0009GF9EC|4|Good product!
B00I86GOIA|3|This costume feel pretty cheap and the strap on the mask broke almost immediately, luckily I think I can sew it back on. It runs very large, I am going to have to pin it or somehow alter it for my son on Halloween night. The size large literally fits me and I am 5'6&#34; and 125 lbs. However he seems happy with it, so it will do the job. Godzilla costumes are hard to find.
B00GHYJO5U|1|Dress runs very small and tight
B0011FTLR6|5|Comfortable, stays put and doesn't ride up on you and is light. Highly recommended for activities (whether at home or outside) I play tennis in mine as well as relax at home in them.
B00QK72MS0|1|Way to small I will never order from This company again!!
B000BP8EFW|5|This dress fits perfectly. High quality. Great price! I would definately buy from this seller again, without hesitation. <br /> <br />Thanks!
B000783POS|5|I got this today via USPS and it came a day earlier than I expected to receive it. I was kind of skeptical about this hoodie because of it's price but, for the money, it certainly does not disappoint.<br />  It is not the heaviest sweatshirt out there but does seem plenty warm. I almost felt like keeping it on the whole day even though I have been inside for the simple reason that this product is extremely cozy!<br />  I am 6'1 and around 350' and this product fits me perfectly, though perhaps even a little longer than I wanted. That is fine though because I wanted something that would fit a tall big guy like myself and this product came through for me.<br />  If I had to complain about one thing it would be the sleeves. Upon sliding them up my arms, as I will often do, it seemed like the right sleeve was just a bit smaller than the left. Then again, that could be my arm, who knows.<br />  Great product! It is starting to get a little cooler here in Texas and I can't wait to stay warm in this Russell product.
B000J3RRZO|5|This product was seriously more than I was expecting. For the price, you can't go wrong. It fit incredibly, and was great for spicing things up in the bedroom! I can see how if you aren't careful it could rip easily, but you just have to be careful putting it on. And, besides, for the price, if it rips after a couple uses I will TOTALLY buy another.
B0080C6ZWW|5|Great thick and dint fall off my little man. I think everyone should use Robeez!! I certainly recommend Robeez for any new mom. I even purchased them for all my friends who were expecting!!
B00IE1OFC6|4|This dress looks better in person and is super cute.
B000KAIY58|3|It is comfortable but after time all the seams are fraying and coming undone. Even the part that hooks on to a hook ripped off not long after I got it.
B008NBPVNO|5|I got this t-shirt for my 8yr old on his birthday.  He immediately put it on, it fit perfectly, and he kept it on for the remainder of the night.  Score one for Dad.  :))<br /><br />thanks again!
B003JYOG9A|5|I have a hard time finding a supportive bra with straps that will stay up.  It takes a little practice to get used to how these straps adjust, but  I like the support of this bra for everyday.  I wear a 34 H or 36 G in most bras.  This style fits me well, and I like the softer stretchy  material that runs along beneath the underwire.  I also like the padded straps and the padded front for no show through.
B00BS9OK30|4|She's very thin so the fit was a little big, but she loves them and loves Hello Kitty, so this was a great gift.
B00L5IZH2M|5|fit is good. material is not too thick.
B00J5V3RGE|3|Ok
B001AE6DV0|5|It is so hard to find slim fit jeans.  I want my jeans to hug me, not just hang on my hips.  These do.
B00B41XZN8|5|Looks really good on. Can't wait to get it in the water! Hope they hold up. I have a pair of Hurley swim shorts and this was the less expensive alternative.
B007MF1Y38|5|Fits well, keeps my hands warm while my fingers are free.  Cute design.  would like them in more colors.  Allergic to wool and these are acrylic..  loving these!
B00OGKH5JY|5|Badass
B00GBD2T7C|5|The iconic waistband is so cute and it is so soft! A truly excellent purchase!
B00C7XIPT6|5|Great jeans! Will buy another pair and have them tapered. Best jeans I've ever owned!
B00J3F319K|5|I couldn't believe how comfy these leggings were...I could've slept in them. Their nice and thin to keep you cool but they are also somewhat sheer. I just made sure I had a shirt that went pass my waist, but other than that they are soooooooooooo freakin' comfy & cute!
B000J6YRA4|3|I'm normally a 34G but since I'm pregnant i decided to order a 36DDD. The band is a little tight. Probable just buy an extender for it. Haven't tried it out yet so idk how supportive it is.
B00OM8G0UA|5|Love these socks! So comfy and I love them with my heavy boots or just hanging out at home.
B00GK4MEQ8|5|Getting lots of compliments when I where this fabulous shirt! Graphic bright and bold! Nice soft stretchy fabric. Highly recommend!
B003IYYEDE|5|This product does exactly what it's intended to do. It covers my mid-section while I'm nursing in public, which makes nursing easy! I have even given it as a gift now.
B00ID0NQPU|5|Looked amazing under my daughters dress.  Color and fit are perfect!  My daughter is a slim 7.
B00KM9C5UM|5|Good
B00GSJHYD8|4|nice quality , very sexy looking and feel. A good buy
B007G4WNN0|5|excelente
B00CEQQZ98|1|I bought these leggings because i didn't want to spend $75 for the real pair. I figured what the heck, can't beat $7. You get what you pay for. The first thing that smacked me in the face when I opened the package was the smell! OMG, they smelled like formaldehyde! They went straight to the washer and then were hung to dry. They STILL smelled like my freshman biology class. The next morning I put them on to wear to the gym. They do not have an elastic waistband. In fact, they had no real waistband. I'm 5'5, 125lbs, and I'm a weightlifter. I'm between a US size 00 and 0. These fit snug around my thighs, but were saggy around the waist and groin area! I kept having to pull them up and adjust the after every set. The one star in this review is from all the compliments I received and for the price. To add insult to injury, when I got home, I noticed a run ( think pantyhose) right down the middle of my bottom. Thank god these were so cheap or I'd be extremely upset over wasting money on leggings I'll only wear once. Horrible quality!
B002HJ3EJ6|5|Thanks. I'm your customer for life,<br />Great fit and value as expected
B005MUBONU|1|When they came I loved them after two washes they are all shriveled up and seem two sizes too small. THey acted like Velcro on my bathroom rug, Do not waste a dime on these they should be taken off the market
B00LU5XNT4|4|Nice shirt!
B00JUMUAF4|5|I needed something for a backless dress that I. I read the reviews and was a little worried about wearing these in the heat. We were going to Vegas and it was 110 there. I figured for the price I couldn't pass them up. They worked awesome! They stuck the hole day!! Never once was I worried about them coming off. I have worn them 4/5 times and they still stick! Definitely reccomend!!
B0018OKTJE|4|i like the color, its is high quality material, looks exactly like the picture and as described. but is a bit biggish for me.
B00FFGGIAA|5|The dress firs perfect! My daughter looks like a princess! Great material! Great color! Great fit! All these- for great price:-)
B005Q8YSHM|2|I ordered this for a Jessica Rabbit costume. I was hesitant because of the price but went for it over the other red dress options because I figured,  for $90, it might be more like a regular red dress than some cheap looking costume item purchased at a Halloween outlet store. The material is less than mediocre and because it is so cheap and so \\"slinky\\" it was ridiculously difficult to alter on my own and I had to pay someone else to do it. The slit is in an unflattering location for most all body types and is not designed well. The cup sizes are way too small in comparison to the length and size of the rest of the dress. (Why can't skinny girls have big, natural (or not) boobs! No one ever gets those proportions correct! The top of the chest area is MUCH \\"pointerier\\" than shown in photo and the small amount of piping used to try and create a bodust-style appearance but the only thing it does is make it very difficult to alter .. I ordered size S thinking it would be better for my chest to be popping out a bit (Jessica Rabbit) vs. messing with the length and screwing up the slit, etc,  but the model they used (supposedly wearing a small) must have been 6'2 because it was so long I could have made a 2nd dress with the leftovers from altering. I'm no model but I have a pretty decent body and can wear close-fitting clothing with out issue,  however this material shows EVERYTHING on EVERYBODY; you can see birthmarks in this thing folks. ALso the material is not as \\"sparkly\\" as it was described but it does have a nice iridescent sheen to it that sorta replicates a \\"sparkly red.\\" Overall I would say if you don't mind the additional cost of altering the entire dress and you have a 10+ bod, go for it. I wouldn't recommend it to my girlfriends....unless they work \\"nightly\\"....in Reno. (No offense to anyone in Reno)
B00AYX93MY|1|Not comfy at all! Doesn't stretch at all. Wouldn't recommend this unless you were getting it for a special occasion and it was coming right off!
B0032PWQXE|5|I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered this set, as the price is so low. I have been very pleased with the whole package to date. All items look great. I love the tie, and it looks like it will hold up for a good long while. I tend to like Donald Trump ties and other nicely made but not extremely expensive options. This tie suits me fine. I am an attorney and like this tie as part of my courtroom attire.
B008PDBXHI|5|It's not red, it's pink! ADDED BONUS!! I LOVE THIS ROBE SOOOOOOO COMFY!!
B003NUUXV0|5|Great value cape.  I used it for a Frank N. Furter  costume from &#34;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&#34;.  Yes, its not perfect, but for the price, its as good as you're going to get.
B00740RESA|5|I love my dress, I was a little unsure at the beginning because I wasnt sure if it would fit but the measurements chart is very accurate and it fit me perfectly! The fabric is very nice and the length too.
B00MHTQI76|4|This fit perfect. It was just TOO LONG. I have an average torso. When I was standing it fit well, if maybe a bit high. When I sat down, forget it. I could literally put my chin on my cleavage. Too bad though. I have been looking for a corset built like this for ages. It was perfect. Just wish it was standard rather than long.
B0058ZXM70|5|slim legs with comfortable waist
B00K1A6KT4|1|For a company called Curvylicious you would think they would take plus size women's bodies into account when designing or buying items they would like to sell.To have a triangular piece if fabric added right where the widest part of a plus size women's body is makes no sense whatsoever to me.I don't know any woman of the plus size category that would wear this.I removed these&#34;hip wings&#34;and now I have a much more flattering top.Beautiful pattern on the fabric though.
B000J3ZLPC|5|I've been wanting these pants for a long time and now that I have them, its great.  I'm a big fan of the Dickie's Girl stuff and the pinstripes are a flattering pattern.  I like the stretch so that they still move even when they are tight.     I'm a bigger girl (women's 10-12) and usually don't look good in Juniors clothes.  The size 13s in these pants fit great, however.    Also, these pants are made well so they last a long time and don't fade quickly either.
B000766OKC|4|Bought these for my lady, she loves them and so do I. The picture suggests they go up a little higher than they do, she is 5'6'' and they only go just past her knees but hey, I have no real complaints.
B00OPCX7UO|2|This hat is way too flimsy for many purposes.  If you want it just to wear sitting on a patio or beach, it probably is wonderful.  If you want to actually wear it and move around, it is not so wonderful.<br /><br />I walk over three miles a day, to and from work, and I always want to have a wide-brim hat to limit my use of sunscreen.  I cannot tolerate any extended amount of sun exposure as my skin burns and I’m left with dark splotches that take months to go away (with the help of a prescription cream).  This hat seemed perfect, especially since it has a chin strap to hold it in place.<br /><br />The chin strap does keep the hat on my head.  However, the slightest hint of a breeze causes the brim to flip and flop up and down, left and right, back and forth.  Without the chin strap, I’m sure the hat would fly off with the softest breeze.<br /><br />Since the brim is directly on eye-level, it is constantly in my line of sight, and the never-ending jerking movement only inches from my eyes is very distracting.  I tend to constantly pay attention to the direction my hat brim is currently moving when I should be watching where I am walking.  Often, too, the movement of the brim leaves my face partially or completely exposed to the sun.<br /><br />I have never actually worn this hat when there is anything resembling a wind.  In fact, I check the weather first to make sure there is never any more than a breeze.  I assume with the constant movement I get from a breeze, a wind would make it useless.<br /><br />As far as being packable, what they mean is you can press it down flat.  You cannot roll it up.  There is a thin wire that goes around the brim and it is easily damaged and bent.  So to put it in a suitcase, it’s probably best to put it in first, so it is up against the flat side of the suitcase.<br /><br />In addition to this hat, I have several roll-up and packable wide-brim visors that I use.  They do not flap in the breeze, and they always protect my face, but they do not protect the top of my head or the back of my neck.  For that reason, I wanted this hat.  Unfortunately, I cannot deal with the dancing brim.<br /><br />I bought two of these hats on a lightning deal and had them delivered to my work address.  I immediately tossed the box in the trash.  Otherwise, I would have returned them once I saw how the brim moves.<br /><br />So, they may or may not work for you, depending on how you want to use them.ut they do not protect the top of my head or the back of my neck.

B00E62D2WG|4|Gold color is lovely, slight shimmer and almost a champagne..  But the arm holes were waaaay too big.  and even with putting darts in, they would stay revealing weird parts of my arm, so it was returned.
B00NCU46Q4|4|Great socks
B00A8LPNTY|2|Very flimsy. I don't feel like it will protect my investment.
B0007CKO7A|4|The order was delivered to me on time.They are in good condition. They fit me well. I am pleased to recommend to other customers.
B00DN3A8F8|1|Poor quality. Too short.
B00D3TQPX6|5|Loved it!
B006MWE7GI|2|very cheap, hair was uneven looked nothing like the picture was very messy looking
B00T8NWDF0|5|Fast shipping, as described
B002IYCUUE|5|After 20 years in this business, I am so happy to finally find a crisp yet soft to the touch, light weight but not see-through, attractive chef coat for women at a price that respects that we get dirty for a living. I have several nearly-identical jackets for a highly-respected French uniform company that cost over $100 more each. Never again. I admit that I haven't tried washing them yet, but I don't suspect they will be any worse than others I've had the misfortune of spending too much for...<br /><br />And for those who complain that they wrinkle - so do all cotton jackets... With good chef jackets, there's no escaping the ironing board (or having them pressed at the cleaners if you value your sanity).<br /><br />Regarding sizing: they run a little bigger than expected and not accurate to the size chart. Use your judgement... I like mine a little bigger to make room for whatever you wear under it... also, more forgiving for those of us with curves.
B000DZA4KI|5|This hat is great! Really keeps your head warm. Two thumbs up!
B009QPT1YG|5|I like these they are comfortable nice black color that stays black after washing<br />I bough 3 pairs for my college age daughter she is size 1 and they not at all snug , but not too big, I am a size 7 and they also fit me well , I bought 2 pair, the only problem is they tend to get pills on them when wearing, so remove with a soft pumice stone lol. I like for the price, they are not of course yoga pants quality, however for  leggings they are nice
B007TWJBOS|5|I love the skirt.  I wear a size 4 in women clothes and I brought the medium.  It fits perfect, the length is just above my ankles and I am 5'5.  The color is a dark denim in stretch material.  I would buy more!!!!!
B00EECC4U4|1|For flat chest women only.
B00DSIZXXU|4|Very nice
B011SB35CE|5|I love these pants!! They look better than what I expected, fit great and sexy as heck! Black shirt to match a must. My friend loved them so much I had to let her wear them. The men in our lives loved them also. That says something when a man comments. A must in anyone's wardrobe!<br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest unbiased opinion.
B001QK4RZC|5|Sent to boost our friend facing chemotherapy.<br />This is just such a happy cap....just do it!
B0079FHGSS|3|The elastic in the waistband was unnecessary. They fit perfectly without it...I do not like having to alter clothing that I buy but oh well.
B00IOVSIO2|5|as advertised!!
B00OIKLYRQ|5|loved them
B00AEC6XVE|5|I ORDERED THESES GLOVES FOR MY MOM. SHE WORE THEM TO OUR CHURCH TEA AND THEY WERE PERFECT IN COLOR AND FIT. SHE RECEIVED MANY COMPLIMENTS AND I RECEIVED MANY SMILES FROM HER. THX!!!!
B00M745SGI|5|I have been looking for a solution like this for a while.  I absolutely love these!  They stay put, look cute and prevent chaffing.  They are great for wearing under dresses or skirts during the summer.  Best of all, they came super fast.  I ordered them in the size that my thigh measured (size B) and they fit perfect.  I have worn them all day three times so far and have had no issues at all.  I have them in beige onyx and white onyx and am going to order the black onyx next!
B00M1SXFF6|3|super cute set and love the robe. the quality of the pajamas is cheap and they appear worn or gnarled after two laundry cycles.. not great for kids clothes.
B00AX7HNP0|5|This skirt looks bigger than it is, but it actually fits really nice and comfortable, not too tight, just perfect to wear any place an be on style. I definitely recommend it
B00E4T0C8I|5|Love these, if you are plus size you will only buy this brand.
B001D0DVK2|1|it really sucks<br />All my documents was dirty cause the leather, i have to clen my documents, cards one by one.<br />I then procen to wash the wallet but it dont see good any more
B00OK90K70|1|I was really excited to get this shirt because I had ordered one in white and loved it. But this shirt is ripped. The lace on the sleeve is so badly torn that I don't even think I can wear it. I am not happy.
B004G8W1UO|5|I ordered 3 of these skirts in total (different colors). This one is my favorite. It's simply gorgeous in person. The only complaint I have is the other skirts came with little slits along the belt line which gives a firm grasp and smooth finish with tying off. This skirt in particular doesn't have them. It's still just as easily tied off and I adore it.     Also, the shipping was much faster than what is stated. I placed the order and received the skirts within a week.
B004HVKM10|1|I got this the other day. It shipped very quickly.  But after two days the zipper broke. I am not paying to get a new zipper in it. Do not buy this! Made to cheap.
B00CY40Q6I|2|Lovely color.  Unfortunately, it runs small, so I had to return it.
B00A7FQLQA|5|Lovely and sturdy cover.  I am pleased that I can not only slip my checkbook on one side but also slip my checkbook register into the opposite side AND ... there is room for my debit card.<br />Very nice!
B00K7YLMJM|4|My kids can't wait to wear this as part of their halloween costume!  Looks just like Ninjago outfits.
B00G4UVLAS|5|These are 100% cotton. . . and what more need I say?
B00LANW360|5|Versatile for it can be dressed up or casual.
B0042SDHR4|4|For whatever reason my Peacoat arrived with a what I consider a flaw.  The button on the left sleeve is attached with red thread, all the others are attached with navy blue thread.  The same sleeve had a red label sewn on so I am giving the manufacturer the benefit of the doubt. I still do not like it and will have to go through the trouble to resew the button with an appropriate color thread.
B005MRN896|1|Bought the biggest size I normally wear a 1x I couldn't get it past my knees and my legs are small.
B000RFX0SM|5|perfect for my guns and ammo party. looks surprisingly a bit real.
B003UTS4VA|5|I purchased this hat to go with my Halloween costume, it looked perfect, a little big for my size, but I surely fits almost anyone. Realy recomend it as accesory.
B006PGGJOE|5|Wallet is just as described and delivery was quick.
B004H3X8PU|5|My seven month old granddaughter is quite a kick. And a kicker. She kicks all her socks and booties off with her chubby, wiggly little legs. Grandma gets worried about the cold little toezies, so knee socks seems like a better option. Glad I got them, because they fit her just right--not too short or too tall, and not tight at all--and they look adorable, and keep her feet and legs warm through all her busy, busy day. They are a cotton blend and come in a little box that can be wrapped and gifted. I bought the 0-12 month size.
B004UIYVGW|5|This was for my Mother who has carried a purse like this for several years.  It was now faded and she needed another.  She loves it!!
B00KFY2MAC|5|Comfy!
B00M9VCSNK|4|fit nice
B005LB7TN4|1|I am sorry to say that these jeans have such a strong, unpleasant chemical odor that I cannot wear them. It's really too bad because they are comfortable, stretchy, flattering, and fit like a dream. I have washed them five times. The first two times were in liquid laundry detergent. The second two times were with a full cup of baking soda plus the same detergent. I even hung them outside on a breezy day, all day long. It made not one bit of difference in the strength of the smell. Today I tried wearing them to class. After half an hour, my eyes felt dry and my throat felt irritated from smelling them. I could even smell it on my skin after I got home. I have been doing some reading on the subject, and conclude that I may be smelling formaldehyde, a byproduct of the synthetic dye process. Others have complained of this smell with these jeans and other brands. There are several suggestions, including Borax, vinegar, and baking soda. No one had success in getting the smell out, even after several washings. By the way, mine are the black denim. I have a skirt by Jag which is a dark blue indigo color, which also smells bad, but not as strong. Very disappointing.
B00AAHBNE0|5|perfect
B00G6L9CCY|3|I agree that with the other reviews that say it runs small and has an awkward fit. The neck is much much wider than it looks on the model (and like the previous reviewer said, the edges of the neckline turn upwards). It runs small in the bust while ballooning out towards the bottom, giving a strange eggplant like look to the torso. However, I do like the quilted front panel. It is thick and looks nice. The whole sweatshirt is pretty warm and very soft. I would recommend sizing up 1-2 sizes.
B007W3XREO|1|Returned
B00PI02PQY|1|Cheapest material and runs extra small
B002BSGVZ2|5|Great pants for newborns and infants. They fit my chubby baby very well and are also cute! I highly recommend them, and they match with many outfits.
B00KJLG5EK|2|I purchased a similar product 8 years ago and loved the convenience of this design.  So, I was very sad when I lost them on the subway.  In search of a replacement, I found this pair, but was very disappointed in the durability of this product.  I've hardly used them and one side has already broken off.
B00LSOK3SG|1|it's very cheap looking I would never wear it
B00K57VA1G|5|Roomy and well made. One reviewer complained that it was one compartment short of what was advertised. If you look closely inside you will find a well hidden slim zippered compartment in there. A bargain at twice the price.
B00H02ZDT4|5|first of all,I like the way install. It does not bother stick it suction cup to the dashboard.<br /><br />when cold weather,suction cup did not hold long time.
B003G5Q9OC|5|If you have thick legs these are for you, I'm 5'5 size 8-10 and an fit an 11 juniors. my thighs measure to about 24&#34;. These socks fit all the way up to my thighs. Very thick,very long. Great for layering, or a cute little skirt. One leg rolls down a bit, but, I don't get a muffin top with these.
B00FULVJ9A|5|I wanted it for a night shirt. I love it!
B0000C124A|2|1st time put them on they ripped on both sides.
B007Y0619S|5|My daughter loves it!!!
B00VTXTRSS|2|Gotta say. This does not look like it's worth $40.
B006TLXXO4|5|they are a very large large...didn't realize they were uni-sex sizing.  returned and reordered them.  great price - good value for the $$
B00FBD2G0I|4|my only compliant is that one of the socks was not sown correctly and therefore unraveled when i took it out of the package but the other 9 were great and nice quality for the price.
B00CA26ISE|5|Love this shirt!  My only wish is that both sleeves and the back would be printed as well making an even bolder statement!
B003JCQ0ZU|5|Gave this shirt to a family member who got a great laugh out of it but also enjoyed wearing it,
B00HU6URMS|5|I ordered the medium to maximize the &#34;hold&#34; on my 36 waist. Was able to fit comfortable and made me look really good in the sweater I bought with it.
B00WB1VFEQ|1|Bad material!!
B00OZ90XZE|3|Its a thin material. Holding the shirt up, I can see through both layers. But my husband loves the show, and liked the shirt.<br />He has had compliments on the shirt!!
B006G7JZAM|5|thanks great buy
B000NV5G4G|5|I bought this product to go with my white dress and my purple dress, looks good.
B0023ZSEQW|5|Perfect, no problems at all.
B0105EQE6O|5|Loved the details of the buttons on these, fits wonderfully. i wear this when I want to be comfortable.
B00DHOGIFC|5|This belt exceeded my expectations.  Very  easy to use and looks elegant.
B00KPXGVVE|5|Item was even better than expected.  Thanks
B0081SKHDS|5|Ideal and attractive measurement
B002DEWB3A|5|I am about 93 pounds at 5 feet tall.  Most \\"one size\\" items never fit because they are entirely too big.  This item was perfect! it is tight enough to hug my body yet it is stretchy enough to easily fit a curvy woman.    Love this dress! Now all I need are some new pumps to pair with it :]
B00APOVL5E|5|Glad I decided to buy 2 pairs of the hugo boss pyjamas, the quality feels really good and when wearing the pyjamas, it is very comfortable. Highly recommended when the price is between $25.
B00BU32AWM|5|Bought and a gift for someone and they loved it!
B000KYDTN6|4|I thought the shirt was very unique and stylish. However, my cousin did not seem too impressed. This was a Christmas present.
B009I2PNI0|5|Marvellous!
B003WIZ55W|4|My husband needed non-binding socks and tried these and another brand, he definitely prefers these.  He'd been wearing Goldtoe socks and while they seem to last forever, they were too tight in the calves. I ordered 3 more pairs of these and we'll see how long before they have to be replaced, so far so good.
B00KSF4MYM|5|Hilarious sweater that people constantly ask where I got it from. Nice thick quality & worth the money for. My 12 yr old son & I share it... Well, we fight over who gets to wear it next.
B00D1H0AWW|5|nice
B00FM7PPP6|4|I really like how this skirt looks on me, wish I would've ordered it a size bigger though. Other than that, I really like it.
B00F2K27FE|5|Fits good, I like the design exactly what I was exspectating!
B008VPZAMO|5|My 12 year old loves them - a little more construction than a trainer bra, good size and fit, soft material and one of the few that comes in grey.  I wish more companies would offer this color.
B00E6O6WVC|3|I really like the style of this outfit! Sadly, the neck opening is comically large. This would fit perfectly on one of the Peanuts characters (pumpkin head, no neck). The legs and sleeves are narrow, so the whole thing never fit properly.
B0015DCPCC|5|Great tie and at an unbeatable price. I bought this tie for weddings and it does the job. This product is of great quality and is worth the purchase!
B00REK5O5A|5|Was a gift for my pops. He really liked it.
B004LYSTCC|1|I cant wear this product the size was not the right size it said medium but it was more like a small rather than a medium I am a small person and so you would figure it would have fit perfect being a medium but not at all..
B00385Y5XW|4|I like that it covers the ears.. completely shielding the baby from wind and cold air...My only issue was that although I bought the Newborn size.. it was loose on her when she was newborn... Now that she is over a year.. it fits her properly....
B004NP4UKE|4|I love these Scrubs!! They are comfortable and I have room to move around working in a Busy Emergency Room
B00UBSSSNW|1|This dress was VERY tight and the split in the back is WAY TOO HIGH! It was right under my butt when I put it on! I think this is for VERY petite women with little to no curves. Be advised. Also, it ships from China so it take some time to get to the US and came in very minimal packaging.
B00AKF7R8I|4|I recommend this product!!!
B00E0G4916|5|My son loves it. It is light, very warm, closes the neck properly. The quality is perfect, the price is really surprising. I bought size large for 12 years (size 14), so it fits for this winter somewhat loosely, but for the next winter will be very well.
B00BCYDN98|5|Gorgeous!
B004Q76PLG|2|These gloves did not fit very well.  The paint on the snap of one glove was all scratched.  They might be fine for wearing to bed after you put lotion on your hands.  I'm returning both pairs.
B00K77XDSM|5|excelente
B003YJBYPE|5|Nice
B005GYGF54|3|When they were put on they went down to mid-calf instead of a little below the knee.
B00D402HRC|5|This fit great on my 6 month old daughter.  Slightly long on the sleeves but nothing a fold or two can't handle.  She will just grow into it within a year which should fit her just right next season.
B00C7XGVO2|3|Not bad, but not what I expected. Was hoping it would be closer to the 511, but is very similar to the 514's.
B001D05Z5G|5|It's like pictures. Very good quality for the price. Good option for cufflink instead of tradicional brands, specially for the price and quality.
B001876U1C|5|I have several Carhartt clothing articles.  They are all of good quality.  They fit well.  Wear well.  I will continue to purchase this company's products in the future.
B00D436UWM|5|Light and comfy. A pretty gown. A good value.
B001G77ZEK|4|Although synthetic, the hair looked very real & the wig was very comfortable to wear. Wore it all night with no problems; no pins or wig-cap needed with it. Got TONS of compliments on the costume & everyone said the hair completed the look perfectly. The only part that was a bit of an inconvenience was the coin headband that came unglued from one side, which I had to re-glue. As with any wig, had to re-form the hair a little bit, so it held the style it was supposed to; but that's to be expected. Very worth the money, though!
B00FFBJE0Q|3|Too big I ordered a 2x and received a 3x. It's more my fault for not checking and the material is thin not heavyweight at all.
B00CH4ONF0|5|It fit him perfectly and he's lean and 6'4&#34;.<br />The material felt high quality.
B000783Q5G|5|nice
B00BLXMS0U|1|Too small, short return window,  Went to request a return and found out its too late. These are too small, Can even get it to close. Do not recommend.
B007ULXFUO|4|Got the color 'winetasting' and indeed a unique color for a denim jacket. I'm glad I bought it. It's nice to have one available in the closet. I bought a medium because there's no more available small size. They said it runs small, so I took the chance. Well, it does fit me fine, with a bit room. Although, I like my jacket fitted, so I'm pretty sure the small would have fit me better, plus I have small chest (for ref: 35-30-38). But since I do love the color, I'm keeping it. The waist adjustable buttons helps in the illusion of a more fitted look.<br /><br />Overall it's nice.
B007GB8EZE|5|Sharp colors. Soft. Cute. Reasonably priced
B007AITZ5Q|4|I ordered this with other products and they all came conveniently in the same box so that was a plus.<br /><br />Not sure if this was a joke or some bad packaging though on the stores part because at first these tights had a different label on them. The picture was different from the one I ordered and I got a little bit scared because I thought they mixed up the order with a different style of pantyhoses. I opened it anyways to see and it was not the same as the label or picture outside the package thankfully. Gave me a tiny panic attack at that moment, but came to relief when I found out it was the same as the one I ordered and that perhaps they packaged it wrong or the store always puts their pantyhose designs in the same pack that has a picture of different style pantyhoses (which I think is misleading and should be changed, but it's nothing too big).<br /><br />The pantyhoses fit nicely and the design is nice. From my perspective I couldn't see the nice flowers and leaves on my legs, but I let my boyfriend check for me and he says he can see it. So I thought it was a problem with my height initially because I'm 5'1&#34; and these pantyhoses would probably look nicer on an average sized or taller woman to see the design to its fullest.<br /><br />But if it looks fine to others, I'm sure it's fine. Just from my perspective it looks a little weird!<br /><br />Overall: Nice product! Please don't put it in a package labeled with a different pantyhose design from the one I ordered though. Kind of confusing at first. ]:
B00C10ZPB6|4|These jammies are ADORABLE but they run a little small through the midsection. They also are not pre-shrunk so make sure you order at least 1 or 2 sizes larger than what you think you need to be safe. Super cute and not as hot as the fuzzy kind.  The butt flap uses Velcro all the way across so its super secure...
B003M2X2BW|3|I remember in the 60's same Levi's but more \\"heavier\\" than this, is too light!<br /><br />Saludos, Allan.
B004J0096M|5|Shipping was great and fast. The produCT came as described.  Fits true to size.  Very warm and comfortable. Perfect for the winter months.
B000N8PYW8|4|Good price... fast shipping
B00LY2YFZE|4|Nice, but fits too large on my daughter who is 9yrs old.
B00JUW0FBI|5|I ordered an XL and this was absolutely fantastic and I've never been more happy with a swimsuit ever. Swimsuits were always me week points, I hated wearing them and It wasn't flattering but this is so absolutely cute. The top fit great, I'm a 38D-34DD and it has so much support and no underwire, I was surprised by that. The bottoms fit amazing and I could bring them up to just under my bust, or could have them showing a bit more skin as well which I like a lot. I really liked this and I like how the bottoms is the long piece instead of the top (unlike I tankini) and I can get more bikini tops to go with it! I love this so much.
B00KJBIONU|4|The shirt is SUPER soft and I love the writing 😊 my only problem is that it's somewhat large, so I have to wear a cardigan or the straps will come off my shoulders. I recommend just buying it in a smaller size than you normally would😋
B00HVJB1D8|2|These are labeled size large, but they are more like a small or medium.
B00QURS6RG|5|Very pleased. Comfortable, cute, and flattering. Thumbs up.
B00QYG1PHG|1|Horrible no where to return it. In the us.
B00HY8FNH6|5|Very nice quality
B007Q35VM6|5|was high quality made, chosen for 3 bridesmaids and tho different sizes all the dresses fit as if they were altered, very satisfied!
B00MTU1MXS|5|My granddaughter will just love it,...... for her birthday 4/9.  Thanks
B00FMNK47O|5|Ordered a large size, and the  size is what I  was  hoping for. Very nice t-shirt.
B00UW2FJ16|5|Good quality socks, which is expected of Hanes. Perfect if you don't want to wear the calf length socks with shorts. Got these for my son and he is very happy with them.
B0006U69J0|5|Thanks

B00EMG3W12|5|These are just like I expected. Great fit, great product!
B00597LHHO|4|there is also no fly. but they are very soft and comfortable. the material is very nice. would buy again if on sale.
B00CM3UVPM|2|Not worth the price - didn't hang off the shoulder and I got a large and normally wear a medium in tops. Material was a little on the flimsy side as well. Returned.
B00JAPCB3A|4|Not bad, did break the first one in about 8 months but id imagine the dry afghanistan air didnt help in making the plastic brittle. Otherwise love it
B004NOO2O4|4|I do like the pants. They are thick material so a bit warm. I got an XS and it fits me perfectly at 5'3&#34; and 112 lbs. Comfortable and no camel toe.
B00CVNXNG2|4|Love this top the way it fits and color.  I just wish the price was a little better. I like shopping online for great deals.
B00OGOSZUS|5|Love love love these pants. They fit great and so comfortable. Well worth the money.
B004C04IZM|5|love it, I wore this one before, during and after pregnancy, and always felt great in it! Great job, It Figures!
B00EPF77OS|5|This purse is everything I wanted and More!  It came fast and in new pristine condition with a dust bag for storage!  I Love It, hadn't stoped caring it since I got!
B00S0OYDOM|5|I am a big Geoffrey Beene fan, and this shirt is perfectly true to size, comfortable, and exactly depicted as the description states. I am VERY happy with this item. The price is also something to jump in joy about. I highly recommend this shirt to anyone thinking they may want to try out a Geoffrey Beene, or to anyone else who prefers the quality of this brand.
B005GN38BY|5|We bought bow ties formy family of boys this year -- they all picked.  These are adjustable and pre-tied, and they look really, really nice.
B0097GCBDC|5|Christmas gift for my husband.  He loves it!  It really looks good & is warm as well.
B00BWRB3XS|4|Great product! The skirt is a thick material, almost costume-like, but nonetheless feels very sturdy. The belt that was supposed to come with it, wasn't in the package, but it's okay considering the reviews I've heard about it. I'm 5'4&#34; (163 cm) and the length is a little too short for me, but nothing I can't cope with, with some tights and shorts. I have narrow hips and the flared-ness of this skirt is perfect for me. Overall, a nice product and I do think I'll buy this skirt again, in a different color.
B00GEIY2E2|5|I love this little shirt! We bought a 4T for our 2 year old, hoping to get a little more use out of it. It is a little big on her but workable. I'm glad we did, as I will be sad when she outgrows this cute little shirt. Overall, it feels pretty well made--there are nice trim touches. I may line dry it, but it seems like it should hold up well enough if I don't.
B00BY8SDTW|3|My pants came unhemmed. It looks like it was factory reject or test order. If the product did come as pictured it wouldn't be so bad but it is still a bit big. A small fits size 4-6 pants size not for someone who wears 0-2.
B00P1FGB1Q|1|I hate this wallet. I won't even use it.
B00E0L2T6I|5|I love it
B005IZTTC2|5|It flows and hugs where it needs to. Haven't had it fall, I love the material because it breathes well.
B00DJ5ZB6Q|4|For the price, it's nicer than I expected it to be. It's not a &#34;rich&#34; cotton, but it's not think or cheap looking, either.  The color is great, and it's comfortable. It should be just right for yoga class.
B0006JAMLW|5|lovely. Soft and elegant!
B00I52PVZ4|5|Nice cardigan and very comfortable. Material is a little thin which what I was looking for since I like to later up sometimes. Great buy and great price!
B005HI641Y|5|I usually love buying guy's shirts, then regret wasting my money after a few washes. Totally not the case this time, though. This shirt has a really relaxed fit, but not baggy. It's soft, all the lengths are perfect and the fabric's lightweight and cool. I feel like i wear this literally once every three days and it's probably the best shirt I've ever bought online.
B002DREXEW|5|I ordered this costume and was a little nervous about not being able to try it on first.  It arrived super fast and was better than I expected.  The shape held up while still being really comfortable.  I was worried about it being one size because I am usually and XL and have a growing belly.  There is lots of room for my growing baby bump though so I won't need to worry about busting out of it by the time Halloween is here.  The oven door even opens and you can take the bun out.  It's really cute and looks well made.  Very happy with the quality and price.
B0055PK3ZM|1|Buckle is too big!
B00BUISAZS|5|I liked so much
B000N8RWPK|5|Everything about the shirt is what I needed.  Be careful, though, because before you wash it for the first time, the dye may rub off on a white undershirt.
B00J96YBTC|1|Was not a push up bra and it wasn't comfortable at all. I would not recommend it
B004XGCY2O|4|I love this hat, very cute, and the little visor comes in handy, however I still need to cover my ears separately as the hat keeps sliding up and not fully protecting them. Otherwise it's a great hat!
B007PXVAJK|5|Great product!
B000JLMBKW|5|I buy a lot of stuff from these guys for my teenage sons and I'm always impressed with the selection, quality, and service.  Plus, my kids love wearing stuff that they don't see on every other name-brand wearing punk at school.
B000X1PPR4|3|Too small and very thin material. I don't expect these overalls to last very long...
B0019RV88Q|4|Hi, i bought this thermal underwear for the mexican winter. here is not 20 degrees o lest so it came perfect. the price is right, they came with instructive, well packaging, and on time.
B004OVEMA0|4|Good fit and happy with product
B005GVHGPK|5|Great products
B002LCXBXS|5|Great product would order  again
B00EH3BG22|5|this is an adorable dress the only problem is the 16 is too large and 14 is too small,,, kind of stuck there, but I did keep the 16 needs a hemming as well very long, and the dolman sleeves well they need to be stitched up a bit as well too deep shows bar underneath, however dress could be very sexy when fixed up,,,,,,,,,
B00BURUMHI|5|Love this scarf! The colors are vibrant and I love the paisley print. Though I steamed it because it was a little too wrinkled for my taste. It even came the day before it was supposed to. :)
B0085WMIC8|5|This was the perfect gift. My son loved it.
B00FCRWVD0|4|Came VERY wrinkled, material is &#34;costume&#34;.  The wrinkles came out with a steamer while on a hanger but it took awhile.  It does run small and is very short so take that into consideration if you are ordering for an adult
B00ASIUJYG|5|hello thank you very much for the dress which as ordered is beautiful and the size is correct I love ...
B00FCRXMOW|1|I  ordered a medium but was sent an extra large and it's to small I will be returning it ASAP
B001RTSCSA|5|I bought these T shirts  for my husband and i love them,they look nice on him...if you like them please go ahead and get some.
B00AHTK15I|3|Just ok.
B0013Y6KGA|5|fits true to size.  they cover a large area, but don't stick up above my tops, and they are modest enough to wear alone during exercise.  great with sweat, keeps you very dry.  i would recommend them to everyone who needs a moderate strength bra, or who has > c cup size needs.  the material is thick, so no \\"gosh it's cold\\" moments.
B00HFQEUX0|4|Looks great on. Ordered a size up. Fits nicely.
B00BPXITUO|5|Fit as expected.<br />Great quality item.<br />Not thin like some I've purchased .<br />Good snaps, they don't come undone easily.
B0060ES1KQ|5|Bought this as a Christmas present for my girlfriend.  It fits her well and she says it feels very comfortable.  Of course, I love it too.
B000VSQFGY|3|I was looking for a hat for a rafting trip and didn't want to spend a lot of money. I originally bought this one, but ended up returning it because it was just too floppy and looked kind of ridiculous on me,
B00P9NQAGQ|4|I ordered two different leggings.They both fit amazing! Me with the height I am, which is 5'10 and weighing 155 lbs. Some leggings I bought in the past were too short or just didn't 'fit right' on me. These are a must-have! Definitely will be buying more :)
B0012DWCOG|5|Very happy with these jeans.  I called to see if they came in blue but had a hard time figuring out what model they would be
B00IUR65S6|5|Love the color
B00BMRRFTY|3|Very small head hole.
B00KIZHCU8|5|This skirt is great. Honestly I didn't think I would like it because I didn't think it would fit me but it actually fits perfectly and it's super soft. Definitely would buy again. Recommend😁
B00DYRINMI|3|Fits my son well on the shoulders but it's a little short. My son is not super tall, about average 7yr old. These shirts will hopefully last this year. My son turns 8 in April and these shirts are size 7. They are nice shirts just run small.
B0002V36TE|1|These pantyhose ran in the toe on the first day of wear.  I had heels on and walk around all day.  They did not last up through lunchtime.  By the third wear, they were trashed with a big run and my toes poking right through.
B009O90F8K|4|For me the waist is little loose, but nothing a belt doesn't fix.  Good pants for the price.  They are a little on the bright side.
B002LB7SZG|1|The idea is great... but the implementation isn't even third rate.  Look very closely at the photo of this strap.  There is only one point where it can be adjusted with the single buckle.  OH! that other thing at the other end of the strap is the \\"key\\", not a buckle.  NOW, look at ANY regular camera strap (by the way, All OTHER camera straps CAN be adjusted to either hang in front of you, or extended to hang to the side).  Both sides are adjustable on ALL camera staps. Other straps can center the cushioned pad that goes around your neck.  No one bothered at PacSafe to try the strap out with it ATTACHED to a camera!  The problem arises when you attempt to adjust the strap where it holds your camera with the bottom just above the belly button when the camera is hanging in front of you.  Where does the cushioned pad on the strap end up?  Duhuhhh! it ends up totally to the right or to the left of your neck, providing no cushioning whatsoever.  This is because the buckle is BLOCKING the pad!The only explaination is that the Chicoms not only made these straps... they DESIGNED them as well!!  Oh yes, dear friend... we cannot even make camera straps in the U.S.!!!  And this is the result of outsourcing the engineering and manufacture to Communist China of the simplest things we used to make here in the good old U.S. of A.  The ONLY.. I repeat the ONLY use for this strap is for large camera cases that you put around your neck on one side, and place the camera or camera case on the other side. That works.  But forget about using this for your camera strap unless you want it hanging in front of your crotch!!  THEY LIE!!  What's going to happen when we have the Chicoms design and build our fighter jets and military tanks?
B000VXJX0Y|1|I've been taking Vemma for 3 years and have been a loyal supporter of the product (I could always tell by how I felt when I ran out of it). Until last week, I had a physical and my blood pressure was dangerously high for the first time in my life. Vemma did not help prevent this and the investment, I would of thought that it would of helped a little. Yes, I'm 47 now and my body is changing but I believe that there are better & cheaper options out there besides Vemma. I agree that it taste good to me but I think that I can look pass that to some better healthier options.
B00JB2DPH8|5|Perfect! I got a complement on them the other day too on how cute they were while I was at The Bar Method!
B0076PGAL0|2|It was too big
B0061Q3D9W|4|Lower in price than some other fire resistant clothing.  Seemed to be just as good as quality as the more expensive brands.
B003STDNCM|2|I ordered these because I have problems finding pants that fit my thighs. I am 6'2&#34; and about 230lbs. I could barely squeeze into them and they were skin tight. I guess they might work better for smaller people.
B007YC0FFW|5|This shirt is really lightweight but not flimsy, which makes it great for exercising in (I use it for dance classes). I got a medium, which is what I usually wear in tops, and it fits great. It's not skintight - it has a little room, but it also isn't loose and baggy. The cut is nice too, and I loved the purple color. I'm ordering more!
B005UVPW5C|5|Muy buen producto esta todo perfecto lo recominedo la talla adecuada!!! gracias por el producto es igual que la imagen el color y el estampado
B0029XFUPQ|4|very happy with bag nice size and color plum. And the price $16.00 was a good deal.
B00B9FMC4M|2|I normally wear size-small clothing - these are too small for me. Maybe if I had purchased mediums I would have been happier, but these were just too tight and gave me a stomach ache if I wore them for too long.
B00CZFD2SA|5|Plain Beautiful. I have received so many compliments. Thanks
B009S7LO92|5|Great fit, warm, looks neat on a cool kid!  Came early.  Very satisfied!
B00CDJPNJY|3|It is a nice hat, however it is really small.  I don't think it would fit most adults.  It's also much more pastel colors than it looks in the photo.
B00BUN5AW4|5|Awesome shirt...Nice graphics and very soft material.
B0027VT5VA|5|I purchased this dress for my daughter for a 70s party and I love it. It is so bright. The picture does not do the colors any justice. Nice and shimmery.
B003O2S6HU|2|While this costume is super cute,  mine showed up with STAINS! The white part of the top has brown stains on it. I'm pretty disappointed. Hopefully I can get them out before the weekend.
B00BOEA2W2|5|very nice ,always like 4-rth all garments
B00DMEVI4I|4|My granddaughter needed a red turtle neck for a school activity and she was very happy with it.  The fit and color was on point.
B00BQRYGXS|3|Let me start of by saying this does work as advertised.  It is &#34;front pocket worthy&#34; like they claim on their website, but does display a bulge if you happen to wear skinny jeans like myself. In the back pocket it's hardly noticeable which is great.<br /><br /> I keep my ID in the ID slot, 4 credit cards in the first slot, 4 misc cards (Metro Card, insurance card, Dunkin Perks card, etc) in the second, and cash in the third slot. I can keep up to 15 bills as advertised. All the contents in the wallet together make up a nice little package.  I know exactly which card lives where and don't have to stumble when pulling something out while commuting or on the go.  However, I noticed after about 2 weeks of use, the leather stretches.  If you keep anything less than 4 in each slot, cards are sort of loose and I get paranoid of them falling out.<br /><br />Here is why I give 3 stars.  At a $65 price point I'd expect better quality.  The leather and stitching is nice but the plastic on the ID slot cheapens the whole thing.  It does not make this look like a $65 wallet.  The plastic is just not tight, and sort of has bubbles.  Not cool.  I'd also think that the leather could smell more &#34;leathery&#34; since this is the premium version of the Slimmy.<br /><br />If you're looking for a slim wallet solution overall this is pretty good. Just don't get the model with the plastic ID slot.
B002P82OZO|5|I live in NY and it is great
B0085YHM68|4|Awesome bag but one of the zipers broke only after 5 months of use. We have used it heavily but for the price we expected better quality.  Nonetheless,  the design is good with lots of pockets and classy for men and women too.
B0007QMKBY|1|Didnt like this. It was very uncomfortable. I never used it.
B0084HMFCW|5|I like the length, so difficult to find the right length for my 5'8&#34; frame! Comfy with give when crouching or bending over.
B00DP7VDY2|4|My hubby loved it!
B0033AYT5G|5|nice
B00I1LUJD8|5|Good quality and my husband loved it and says it fits great
B00J4W3SMC|4|Color was a bit more orange than peach but still like the top due to the breezy sophistication of this loose T w/ Dolman sleeves.  Great for hot summer days!
B00S3MHELU|4|This fit as expected, but only because I knew style ran small. Be warned, it is neoprene, not fabric and so it looks and feel different. A very cute cut in the top and the bottom. Flattering for sure. I'm full bottomed and smaller up top - a bit of a pear shape, but I found this suit to look cute on both halves of my bod. The top could be a smidge smaller for me, but hello, I'm not evenly proportioned. If you are like me, don't worry, this suit will fit. Typical Brazilian style full bottomed cut - smaller than the US idea of the same - low rise and very flattering. Not stretchy in the same way spandex is. Cute, and great quality for the price. No, it's not premium quality, but it's also not premium price. I have a lot of very expensive suits, which I also love, but this suit is a lot of bang for your buck, and sometimes it's good to have suits you wont die 1,000 deaths if they get ruined or go missing.
B002ASND9U|5|Love this costume!  My son looks so adorable in it.  The material is very soft and it is lined, which is a plus.  Sizing is right on. He's almost a year old and ordered 12-18 months. Saw this costume in a magazine for $20 more than Amazon price.  Very happy with purchase!!!
B00CKHE386|4|Somewhat large but if I wear a wig it will fit perfect. Wish it came in small instead of small/medium
B001GA0VIO|4|a bit wrinkled and had to work with it but I do love it! Fits really good now and looks like the picture
B009SB1D1W|4|I ordered an XL to have some room. As a big Commodore 64 fan, this was a no brainer to purchase one. However, I wish the lettering was stitched. If you pull the shirt, you can see the gaps and how one day the lettering will peel. Also, the letters are a bit small. Yes, I'm aware the shirt is XL , but the lettering takes up only half the width of the shirt. Not bad, but I did expect a little more for a $31 long sleeve T-shirt.<br /><br />My advice: Order a medium if you can fit it and wait until it drops $10 from the price.
B00JAWV1IO|5|The product was amazing for the price - it can't be beat. And it arrived withing a week, much sooner than expected. The lace on the item was great - much higher quality than expected for something with such a great price. I would absolutely purchase from this seller again! Sexy outfits at unbeatable prices!!!
B000J41P5G|5|I followed other reviewers advice, and got these instead of my normal size 12 or 13. Really comfortable when I was trying them on for hemming! Haven't worn them for long yet, but I'm sure they will be then. Warning, they do come out of the wash very very wrinkled. I might save them for dry cleaning, or get really motivated to iron them after every wash ;P...
B00N4EDYAW|3|I ordered a size larger and it was still clingy.  The dress is not as long as the dress in the picture.  The material is cheaper than the material shown in the picture.
B00B7QRP2M|5|The dress is absolutely beautiful. The size fit perfect to my body. I am in love of this dress.
B00MFQP00W|4|Good fit. I like the material. Good value for the price.
B004GGUA68|5|Decent shirt - Has that comfy worn feel after first washing, if you like that.
B00KLTED8A|5|Love this so much I wear it everyday!
B00DQ1VST2|3|I would not buy again, and I bought quite a few for colors offered. Better for those who tuck in under blouse.
B00RZPW772|5|very nice!
B00NO4GYU4|2|Folds in very easily and stretched out pretty fast. I ordered my size too.
B0016A7RQI|1|I bought 2 sizes up  my husband liked the extra room
B00N5PDJL4|4|This coat is great. I think I paid about $22 for this coat on Amazon. My biggest frustration was that the shipping got all messed up and it took an extra 4 days to get to us when I ordered it so we would have it for a very cold snap we were going to have.  This has been a very cold winter and it's been very good.<br />A couple things I would like to change so I only gave it 4 stars for these reasons:  The fleece jacket lining is the cheap silky material that has already ripped at both arm holes and the loops at the ends of the sleeves are not strong enough to keep the zip in lining from slipping out of the sleeves, so it's a bit difficult for my daughter to get in and out of.  This seems to be the norm for these types of jackets, though, as my son has the same problem with a different brand but similar style.<br />Above all, though, it's a VERY WARM coat and am I am glad my daughter has it to wear in this miserable winter.
B00K1B236C|5|my son loved it , it fits perfect and glow in the dark was so awesome
B00KHR4I72|4|穿着刚好合适3岁宝宝，估计明年穿不了了，建议买大一码。<br />Just fit 3 years old baby. Recommend buy one more large size.
B00B2PMF3W|2|Fabric was MUCH thinner and lighter weight than expected. The edges were raw cut and unhemmed. While this fabric can be left that way.....it looked, felt and appeared to be extremely cheap! I was embarrassed that I gave it as a gift.
B00MSAZNAM|5|I bought these for friends - they love it!
B0043S10JU|1|The ankle cuffs were too tight - could hardly get them over my feet. And, the waist was way too large. Material was scratchy.
B00CXQFOX2|5|It was the highlight of the buy of the year. I got this for 70~80 dollars and I know I spent every dollar wisely. The scar is a great addition to what already is a fantastic coat that fits me perfectly. There are some that complain about the &#34;squareness&#34; of the coat. Well what do you expect when you see the picture? The quality is great and I feel that its just perfect. The waist length is perfect, my sleeve length is perfect, etc. (I'm 175 6'1' male bought medium)
B00I4BH3XY|5|Love it!  It's lightweight and will be great in the hot AZ summer.  It is quite short, so will probably just wear at home or as a beach cover.
B006QY0HJS|3|Nice wallet however it's to large, very difficult to get in and out of my pants
B00EGJ1QHW|5|It is beautiful. Nice quality, well made. Price was reasonable and arrived quickly.
B000RUJJAU|4|Great set of fangs - very comfortable, easy to use and talk with. The instructional video on you tube is very helpful with the molding process. I filed away the extra molding which worked perfectly. Definitely an eye-catcher and fun addition to any costume. Only (minor) issue is that after 2 uses, I think I need to redo the molding process. Definitely keep a carrying case with you - easy to lose! Great product overall!
B00NKZ36PI|5|Even counting the ones I saw in a small variety in a few Neiman Marcus stores, THIS ONE was in the highest category and truly  top notch!  The colors were brilliant!  I am thrilled!
B00L5F9FLY|4|These khakis are designed to be comfortable enough for long work hours and yet, while far from being a fashion statement, sufficiently good looking to be worn without embarrassment. And they are practical too. They come with 2 front pockets and 2 more pockets in the back and are very much true to size. The fabric seems to have treated in ways that would make it stain-resistant but I didn't stain them on purpose so I won't know until I spill some coffee on them.<br /><br />The only negative, and that's where one star gets deducted is the only one (out of a total of five) belt loop in the back. Wished there were at least two.<br /><br />Update: I manage to spill some tea on the pants while writing this review. To my surprise, the liquid glided off them without the fabric ever getting them wet. I don't know if this will be the case as they are worn and washed repeatedly but, for the record, they successfully survived their first spill.<br /><br />Made in Nicaragua.
B008KCKAVO|5|the quality of the leather is exceptional ...it was packed so professinally...i am in love with this jacket
B00SH2VTPS|3|Fits ok... Straps pop off.<br />White top has really weird breast cups that you can see through from the front. Definitely doesn't look as nice in person as it does in the photo.
B00B00ZH2U|5|Perfect gift.  Fit was right on as well.  Delivery time and experience also went well.  Great present for my girlfriend who lives for bacon
B00ME9YM04|3|this material was good, but the back was to big
B006YTM7VQ|1|I don't like this sweatshirt.  I should have ordered a medium but read the reviews and ordered a large based on other's reviews.  Just didn't like the feel of it.  Nice color was the only thing I liked.
B00DSQRWV8|5|they fit like the  lux  maybe the straight legs are a slimmer cut..or jst these two..cause I do have some black ones tht are now such a tight cut....
B00INT7Y8G|5|fits great im size 12-14 in pants and the XL fits great in both my butt(apple bottom) and breast. I love that it hides most the lower part of my tummy due to the fact that I had twins 1 yr ago and still need to work on things:) great fabric and cant wait to wear at the beach!
B00076ZREG|5|The shirts are exactly what I expected.  Basic, good fit and great price.  I would recommend them to folks looking for the same.
B0055D58A4|2|Thick cotton. But not a lot bigger than the 10's I recently purchased. The 10's are comfy but wanted the 12's for lazy day comfort.
B00M1TN5OQ|1|Cheap material, runs small
B002URQBR2|5|Great product.
B004HJR2FG|5|we got this for our 5 groomsman and father of the bride and it is awesome<br />silk is lovely and it looked good with the ivory vest, white shirt and black tux the guys wore<br />high class for small price
B000EGO9BQ|3|It fits a too tight on a regular sized male head and is whiter than it appears in the image. Probably better suited for younger females.
B00J59YCN8|3|These are xmas gifts.
B0048WWA0Y|5|The scarves ordered and I ordered all the colors and 3 sets of them! ARE WONDERFUL!  I ordered them as gifts..for my use..and, for gifts to my husband and another gentleman that both dress blacktie, and very formal tails black tie. ( the black & white ones)..and black for the black dress coats...I use them..also, ....I have not washed them yet..but nothing liked that would ever be abused is a rough wash method..I'm very happy and so is my retired commercial pilot husband that loves the brown scarf in his leather jacket! They are soft, generous sized warm..and not itchy woolly!! ;~}
B00R11Q438|5|Was kind of worried about how it would look compared to the actual Triangl Swim, but it looks perfect!!! Top does not have padding but since they are made of the wet suit material it is totally fine. Overall I am very happy with the swim suit!!!!(: Do not hesitate ordering!
B00IIGV9OE|1|incredibly small and expensive shipping
B008GTYXZK|5|Bought for our daughter who loves J.B. Went by some of the reviews and ordered one size larger. That was a mistake as it is way too big. Otherwise is was a good purchase. Good quality.
B00N5LK3P8|5|very nice dress, i got lots of compliments on it.
B00DF003AO|5|I loved the fabric and the bow was awesome and stayed fluffy and firmly tied in the back. Perfect sparkly accents for the holidays or any special occasion.
B00OOL69VA|4|Great
B00A8IXEUC|5|Finally swimshorts with a real drawstring! We've gone through so many bathing suits and are so glad to have finally found this one. Looks awesome and fits great.
B009HC5WNM|5|Very soft, pretty, and perfect for my needs. I've gotten multiple compliments and highly recommend this beautiful scarf. You won't be disappointed.
B000VLTXP6|1|Definitely your typical incredibly poorly made Halloween crap. Zipper was ripping out of seam right out of package and the one size fits all is a bummer. I was hoping for a period-looking vest for multipurpose use and got beer/pirate wench and that's it. I don't think anyone larger than an 8 would be able to fit into this at all.
B00472MCJE|4|Love the hat...perfect size...but wish it wS lined.
B00P7SDDZE|4|Item as expected. Good experience with seller.
B00K7IQVZ8|5|My hubby loves his new thermals.. fit perfectly, and keeps him warm. Great price too!!
B00D3WILM6|2|I'm either extremely tall or this is made for oddly shaped people. Gave me real bad wedgies. Also the cups seem to be made out of cardboard and everything was just uncomfortable once I got in the pool.
B008FN8AF6|5|I ordered the tee to go with a pair of pants I had bought separately.  The match was perfect, and the outfit fits the size to a tee.
B00CLF1BZA|5|I bought this for myself for work as the one they gave me was falling apart and constantly detaching itself. This makes me feel special when I show up and it is good and strong ... I know I won't lose anything important, like keys or identity tags, as long as it is on this lanyard.
B000WLV7OK|5|Actually bought this for a costume...and ended up wearing it to work a few times! It has a comfortable fit, no complaints.
B00D73AMOG|5|Exactly what I was looking for. I usually wear a size 0 or a waist of 26 so I ordered up a few sizes, a size 4/28 and they fit perfectly!
B00OD3PGH2|4|Glad I listened to the other people and ordered larger than usual. Gave 4 stars due to the sizing issue and I found it a little expensive for the quality. It's a nice coat, it does as it's supposed to, keeps you warm and dry.  I only mention the quality because when I put it on the liner comes out of the sleeve holes. At this price I expected not to have issues like that.  But overall beautiful  coat, color is spot on as pictured, dies what its made to do, but runs small so order the next size up.
B00PUXC3LG|3|comfy to wear , not form fitting at all..thinner material than expected but nice to throw on
B00KN3C5OS|5|very comforable. The size is a little larger than normal. Price is so good @ 41
B000N8X5J2|5|These jeans are built to last and good for casual wear also. Great quality, a little longer than listed though but waist size is accurate.
B008CLNE7K|5|For the price. These were perfect
B009EDXZBU|5|Easy way to pump at work in short time with the comfort of feeling less exposed.  Also very comfortable fit
B00FMQZUZC|4|They are a little tight on my legs but they are nice cozy and warm socks. I don't know how you would wear the gloves, they remind me of cats. But it's a nice bonus.
B00246BN04|5|I bought this for my daughter for work, she liked it and said it fit good.  She didn't tell me if it washes and dries well.
B00FN2UXWU|4|The material and jacket itself was so great but the L size I found it a little small for a L size jacket, maybe the seller could more detail info regarding each size
B00G40L8W4|5|I was plesantly surprised, I expected a jacked to wear over a shirt, but this is more like an overcoat, really nice for a chilly summers night party outside. Very elegant :)
B0067WOW1I|4|I love my colored wife beater shirts.<br /> I allways wear these when I am beating my wife so I will look my best when the cops come.
B00K3GGSKC|4|These suckers had me convinced I'd packed on the pounds. I tried them on in store and went a size up to a 9 in the jeans and the capris, and to an 11 in the shorts! They do make my butt look pretty nice though. It's worth it.
B00340N2Z8|4|This is on my clipboard for work. I love it. It's a really good size and could even go on a car window or something.
B00BKIF5EW|5|This was purchased to go with my jean jacket. Matching very nicely.  Even had to return first order and had no problems with exchange.  Will enjoy when Spring gets here or early fall.
B006PCB8BM|5|Fits comfortably, beautiful and it makes me look like I have boobs! Love this bra so gald I finally decided to try a water bra out! I'll never go back to just padded bras!
B0081KKQ96|5|a warm, soft water resistant Hoodie. Brilliant<br />Great for walking on the beach in the winter in Oregon. great for sitting in the stands for football.
B00LW4RM90|5|my son is a minion now!
B005RX140K|5|I am so thrilled with these incredibly soft and absorbent handkerchiefs.  I purchased them due to my incessant use of tissues due to hot flashes.  I really did not want to continue using so many tissues and throwing them away.  I just ordered these a couple of days ago, and they already arrived today.  I put them to use right away, and I am very happy with the softness.  Another plus is that I can blot without taking off my makeup (depending upon the severity of the hot flash, of course).  I can tell that the quality is excellent, the edges are hemmed professionally, and the fabric is quite thick.  I don't know yet how they will hold up in laundering, but according to the other reviews, it appears quite well.  I love that they are made in America by a family run business.  Thank you to Jennifer Barrass, the owner of The Organic Handkerchiefs Company for making such a useful, and unique product.
B00XT6J0OE|5|Bought this for my 33 year old son.  He loved it.
B004L6HA7U|1|Fit great.  Then I washed it and the size L became a size small.  Seriously, it's an absolute joke how much this rag shrunk.
B005DCWU2Q|3|I don't write many reviews, but this product is worth it.  I've had mine for a couple or 3 weeks now, and it's like \\"man, that's a good belt\\" ... it's very well made.  I'm so pleased I've just ordered another one before the price goes up, because it's worth more than they are charging for it.<br /><br />UPDATE: 5/6/2014 -- well, after wearing these for a couple of years now, I would have to say I'm somewhat disappointed. The belt keeps breaking out of the buckle every couple of months. It's easy to fix with a small screwdriver and a leather punch, but you have to cut off about 3/8\\" each time you make the repair.  I really like the belt, I just wish they have made it better. I have to drop my rating down from 5 stars to 3 stars because of this.
B00EYJZB2A|5|perfect. Thank you
B005H3BT46|5|Purchased for my teen son, a huge Adventure Time fan like the rest of the family. Fits perfectly & he absolutely adores it.
B00CJHXQHQ|1|i bought one for my wife at her request. We went through the selections and settled on this one, should've spent the extra $ on a better one. She is an avid runner and after a month of trying to make it work it now sits mostly unused waiting to be stripped for parts. &#34;Uncomfortable at best. Bottles fall out or constantly slide around which had limited it to two bottles if going for a longer run.&#34;
B00R55LFWK|3|Fits nicely
B009FV8CQ4|3|It shrunk when I washed it the first time.  It fit as expected when I got it and now it is just like wearing a normal shirt. I'm very disappointed
B00BZG3GOK|4|Fits ok, leggings could be better for larger thighs, garter doesn't stay in place, but my husband loves it.
B009XEK1B2|5|Nice tie and get complements about this.
B00KGCULYM|1|I have purchased this product before and they continue to major disappoint. This one was falling apart in &#60; than a week the lining was coming out have to say it is a piece of junk to put in nicely
B00H7OX1BC|2|Thinner than expected, not much volume to this scarf. I like the color but the quality isn't excellent. I can't see myself getting much use from this item, such a shame.
B002WDQ17Y|5|Perfect socks for teens.  This were given as a gift to a 14 year old and I think she really loved them.  Nice thick, soft, knitted yarn, well made, and warm.  They are so mismatched they match.  Very cool socks to show off in!
B00AWGCQLI|3|For some reason, it never seems to stay wrapped around my neck, and the hood is just too big -- but having said all of that, it serves the purpose.  We've had a lot of snow this season, so it's definitely useful in the weather.  I just wish it fit a big better, more snug, and not with the stupid point at the top!
B00BWM6D9W|3|This was a Bit Unique, Not what I expected. but I made it work.<br />Some pieces fit, like the sash and the gloves (they were not advertised so it was a nice surprise)<br />Some pieces were WAY too large, such as the robe and the outer sash. the robe was like 7 and a half feet long! (I ordered the XXL because I'm a big guy. ) whatever I can Hem it. but I found it strange that there were no sleeves! and it had these little pockets on the side. very weird.<br /><br />But! I figured the sleeves would be apart of the tunic, and I was right. BUT! the tunic did not fit at all! and the sleeves and shoulders were puffy? like a Victorian era piece. the outer tunic fit but just barely the zipper is tiny and will burst if you breathe to hard.<br />then I realized this is NOT Anakin's costume, this is Palpatine's Costume! The one he wore in episode III.<br />the outer belt was a bit too small but I will have to lose some weight.<br />Pants do not fit at all.<br />But for the price I cannot complain.<br />I will use some of the pieces and tweek the others to make them work.<br />If all the pieces fit, I would say get it, but as is it is a Bit underwhelming.
B005Q7V9IE|4|Everyone gives you onesies for gifts, but no one gives you pants.  These are soft and comfortable and nicely accomodate a growing baby.  They run larger than other popular baby brands - the sizing is closer to 3-6 months.  However, the legs and waist can be rolled to also make them work during the 0-3 month phase.
B001E95K38|2|Its been a while. lots of washings...still stiff and has not relaxed.  Not a great feel.
B00DUH8EP8|3|I own another pair of the pull on jeans (Peri), which while too large still in the waist, were not as overly large as these. Unfortunately as soon as I tried them on I knew they would end up bothering me at work all day due to having to constantly pull them up or trip on them. The quality itself is decent (although just as an FYI, these have a large jeweled design on the pockets), but unless you also have a larger waistband and/or like to wear giant heels, these may not work well for you. Returning them as of today.
B004N7SZVC|5|Bought these shoes for my 3 year old daughter for the summer. Needed something easy to slip on and to wear to the pool. Love the shoes and will probably buy again.
B001RKYP5I|4|I originally was going to buy a Medium the size I wear normally but after reading the reviews it was made clear that the size of the shirt is one size bigger than expected. I am very glad that I read the reviews because I feel that the Medium would've been huge, the small is still a little long but it will work. The material is a little on the thicker side. The shirt tag is located on the left side a little bit above the waist. I feel that the tag is in an annoying place so I will probably cut it off.
B00L9VNX9E|2|Nice material. Way too small.
B005GYGEXM|2|These leggings are made from a really soft material and are comfortable, especially for people with sensitive ski . However, the spandex isn't strong enough and the leggings are too loose around the waist. I should have purchased the smaller size to get the fit I want.
B00TUEG7WM|5|GREAT BUY ! At an awesome price. For $24.99 this was an great great purchase. Bought it for my fiancée for her birthday she needed a spring coat , and she loves the jacket. Awesome fit great style, And 100% satisfying
B008K9XETW|4|I read all the reviews that said it runs big. So I ordered down.  This was not true for me.
B0018SPBPW|3|The color was solid black and really nice however the way it is cut had me checking to see if I ordered skinny jeans. It's a bit on the slim side and not a lot of room between the waist and the seat.
B00959MTO2|5|Nice quality gloves.  Very soft.
B00AVWR8SY|2|awkward in my opinion i like my scarfs to be a bit longer and not so tight
B00BMDBA1C|4|Bought to go with my femKhan costume for a Star Trek party. Mine that came looks slightly different than pictures, the stun/kill piece is all orange with no white detail, there is no orange nub above the stun/kill piece, and there is no orange detail on the bottom of the handle. There is orange detailing on the top of the gun. Doesn't matter to me, I'm going to be painting it silver, just worth noting. For the price it's fantastic, I think I paid 6 bucks.<br /><br />Pros:<br />good shape<br />makes sound - two different blasting noises<br />flip between stun and kill<br />nice size<br /><br />&#34;Khans&#34;:<br />wonky colors<br />fliping between stun and kill doesn't work smoothly<br />right side is the &#34;ugly&#34; side with the screws showing, but if you're left handed this isn't a negative thing<br /><br />4 stars because of the misshapen stun/kill piece, otherwise it's exactly what I'd hoped for.
B0016OWAKC|3|I bought this cell phone case to replace a very expensive case that I bought at a boutique.  The expensive case started falling apart after two months.  If this case lasts half that long then it is probably worth the money.  My smart phone fits and if I am careful with the zipper I will get my money's worth.
B003HBDPHY|2|This coat is well put together with nice material but it is large in the bust, noticable small in the waste and the hips are large enough it looks rather strange.  Especially for someone short.  The bottom sticks out like an A designed skirt.  Definately looked strange for a raincoat however if you are built like an hour glass it might work for you.  I thought I would keep it for something to just throw in the car but then decided I would not wear it and gave it to Good Will.
B000ARWMLS|5|It's cold in New England on those early morning dog walks.  I use these long johns every single day and love them.  THey're stretchy, comfy, and yes - warm.
B000XPSMLQ|5|VERY NICE
B00O9K64LG|1|This is a 3xl for tween. Gave the jacket to my niece who is a size 3.
B00AFQEVEA|3|Excellent Pant
B003TPQ5ZC|5|Too small in the Chest
B0026HUVRC|4|The shirt came on time and is of good quality but I was the wrong size. I like it enough not to return, I'll give it as a gift.
B00HSOJCKU|5|Awesome tutu... as expected. My daughter loves it
B00BAY48NA|4|Just what I expected. The top fits great, the bottoms are a bit small, but the top is so cute and versitle that I can easy pull it down to cover up any issues on the bottom. Love the suit and style!
B003WBQCQA|5|looks great
B00KCR26RG|5|These are actually very nice. They are thin  but that's what I like. They are well made. I wish I could get my size in white but all if the white ones are a larger size. Be sure to look at the sizing when ordering. Different colors and styles come is different sizes.<br />It's hard to find cotton, low-cut, toe socks. Due to a bruised toenail I have to wear flip flops for awhile and the weather is getting cooler. These socks are going to help.
B00EVUR6LQ|5|If you like cats, these socks are adorable, very comfortable.
B008NZ7DD6|5|Me: 5'9\\" 236lbs Size 14-16 Pants. It is very hard to find hosiery for my size plus my height. Women who are 5'9\\"+ and 236+ I could safely say they would even fit you i would guess these are around 1x-3x easily. Buy a few pairs to have them on stock. Amazing!
B00LPKOE06|5|like
B000N8X7OA|2|I have worn Dickies for about 10 years now. I have always been a fan of their shorts and work pants. These overalls were not true to their sizing at all I went by all the other reviews and ordered a size up from my normal. I normally wear a 30X30 in any brand of clothing. When i buy Dickies i usually buy 32X32 just because they tend to shrink and become snug over time. I ordered the overalls in a 32X32 thinking they would fit just like all my other products and boy was I wrong. They were massive!!! Extremely too large. So very disappointed.<br /><br />Please go to a store and try them on in person first and not only trust reviews on here or you will be stuck with some overalls that just do not fit and will never fit.
B00H7QL45A|5|Bought as a sticking stuffer this year. Like the assortment and the way it's packed. Pleased with the price! I would buy these again!
B007XRLZ8E|4|I am pretty happy with this purchase over all.  The bag looks well made, looks masculine, and durable.  The only thing I do not like is there is not a smaller area for pens/more pockets inside the bag.  This is not a bag you want to fill with all sorts of things, just some essentials and keep it moving.
B00BH0M834|3|While this was very cute and reasonably priced, the seam between the top and the skirt is done poorly and is very scratchy and uncomfortable to wear.  I had to separate the two pieces to make a shirt and separate skirt where I lined the stitching with a soft fabric so that it would be wearable.
B004VA9GUA|5|I ADORE this! I just got it, early of course, and it looks great!!! I have a huge butt but I wear barely a B cup bra so I got a size M/L. The bottoms fit perfect and I was amazed that the top did as well!! It looks small but a size C cup person could wear it perfectly because it is stretchy. It's very cute and girly but also has that edgy look that my boyfriend LOVES. I can't wait to show him this :)
B00I4EAN0Q|4|Great hat.  Should have been packed better to preserve the shape.  Arrived misshaped.  Trying to correct it by stuffing w/ paper
B006N04V2O|5|I found it to be true to size. (XL) It is nice and soft. Awesome price, can't go anywhere else and buy it that cheap. Looks just like the picture.
B00P1ISSDM|5|Very well made and very bright cost is good
B00C4NPTB6|5|Awesome outfits for my twins and fast delivery!!!
B009ZEYC7O|5|They run a little small so order large. They're all great fun. This review program wants me to write more words but that's kind of all I have to say. Funny. Like.
B00F9R8GZA|4|This product is good overall, material is thick and has a little stretch. The length is at the knee, basically looks as shown in the picture. I am 5'2 120lbs and for me the high waist and size small fit just right. As I am petite I am aware that this must run small as most things normally do not fit my waist perfect (unless petite sized which this item was not listed as such). Also this item is very form fitting so if you're looking for more room I don't suggest this. However, overall I am personally happy with the skirt and I will definitely be wearing it!
B00RM2EYYC|5|Great hoodie! Better than we expected, order a different one first and didn't really care it. This one more than makes up for it!
B00N1I3EEM|5|exelecte
B00PBCBSNU|5|My 18yo son is a cat fan and this is the best shirt ever. Finally a cat shirt for a guy that says Heck Yeah! T-Shirt marketers should look at this as the go to for a guy cat shirt...
B009Y9QCCS|1|I'm sorry but these socks don't feel any warmer than a plain pair of Hanes. $26 for four pairs is entirely too much for these.
B0091K71HA|2|I bought it to wear for work to wear it for Halloween it's a little bit tight in the hip area, and when I received it , it had a little tear on the side
B00L3XC4UC|5|This is actually redder than the picture, which is perfect. It'll be such a cute Christmas dress.
B00JMBRVU0|5|Love it fits great and it is light and warm  the best!
B00I1AMY7I|5|really nice and warm
B00T11Z9LE|2|The crisscross on the cups made my girls look huge! So if you want that - go for it. I did not like the color either - too much black, not enough color. Tried to exchange for a different model, but received no response from the seller - will not buy from them again. Will be wearing this in the backyard only.
B00FPU73EQ|5|Love these! I use them all the time with flats and closed toe heels. I'll probably buy some more if these wear out. So far they are holding up to washings just fine.
B002GU688A|3|It's comfortable, but the waistband does sit high on the waist. If you don't want people to see your CKs when you reach for something and your shirt lifts, look else where. Size is true, and like most CK items, the quality is good.
B00C2NN2TE|5|This is very pretty and delicate.  You need to be careful with the mask as it is very thin, but pretty.
B0085BEPM0|5|These pants are true compression pants. I have a few different brands and these are the best and an excellent value. I have several pairs of these and have had them for a few months now. I use them every day (gym, running, skiing) and wash them regularly with no problems at all.  They still look, feel and perform like new.  Definitely recommend them. They fit great and have great compression behind the knees which I like a lot.
B00MXJ9VC4|1|The material was very flimsy and it was to the knee and not floor length as promised.
B002MLC51C|5|dear<br /><br />I would like to subscribe very much for your dear to me and I want to be a client I have you to<br />And I tell you that the dress in a very beauty and magnificence
B007Y3O9FI|5|I have been looking for good boot sock for a while now and couldn't find anything that fit and didn't bunch up in the first ten steps.  These fit well and stay put all day.  I will be buying more!!!
B00FFX75ZA|4|Somehow bigger than a expect after all its beautiful just like the pict .i like it so much yes i love
B00QCFSHYI|2|Way too big I'm returning.
B003PGR3ME|5|Excellent!!!!
B00LOUALLS|5|Better quality than expected, thick material, I'd recommend it to anyone!
B000PHOGRQ|3|They are soft, very nice when new, but Hanes need to make them a bit more elastic, maybe adding 2% or 3% spandex (or another elastic material). First wear is all good and comfortable, but once you wash them and keep wearing them, they quickly start to go bad. By bad I mean the start to feel larger and stiffer (not as flexible) until you need to replace them and that happens pretty soon. I expected better quality. Didn't have that problem with GAP, Hilfiger or Banana Republic.
B0006I3WCY|5|I have worn the underwear for many years the comfort is the best. I try to find them on sale but they hardly ever go on sale and when they do they are sold out of my size.
B00JTTWCGS|3|bottom to small
B00C5TOH0S|5|Great prboduct
B001M2DSNG|5|I like these as i walk a lot with my dogs so the open fingers is good for holding the dogs leash,nice and warm.
B00OI4QMEM|1|THese are definitely not Plus sized!!  Am sending them back.
B00RH8Q994|5|Love it ☺️
B002G9UDYG|3|Hat is nice, stretches and fits well.  Sufficiently warm.  However, despite the description, the hat is NOT made in USA.  It is made in Canada.  I purchased this hat based on the &#34;Made in USA&#34; description, so, although the hat is fine I am disappointed.
B00D8GO06S|1|Horrible
B00CBM9BZU|5|Love the outfit. BUT it runs small so I ordered a larger size for our daughter and I am so glad I did. It's nice quality. My daughter has posed for all the family.. she truly loves it.
B0094TIBIQ|5|Very comfortable nightgown.  Color is almost a dusty rose shade.  Very happy with putchase.
B00C85G3C4|4|this is cotton, mostly it has 5% spandex also the description missed that this is from china and has Asian sizing. I orderd a large the tag says Asian large American medium. which is fine I wanted a looser fit and a true large would have been too big I think, it does have a low scoop and is rather strait (no curved seems). I am short and slim so im really glad for this, I hate those curvy dresses with the huge butt allowance.  overall a good cheap mostly cotton dress.  oh im about 5' 1'' and it is knee length.
B003UYTSTW|4|My three year old just learned how to go on the potty, so we got these cause he loves trucks.  They do what they are supposed to, however.. he wore them once and it ripped at the seam near the top ( I assume from him trying to pull them up ).  They had a huge rip, so I threw them away.  I still think they fit well and they arent too small like the Hanes underwear.
B00L1FJQ62|4|I'm not sure if they are too big or they just have a tendency to slowly creep down in the crotch area.  Find myself pulling them up every now and then.  Other than that they are not bad, pretty comfy.
B00EPI1PS4|5|Any kid roaming the streets of gotham looking for crime to stop will look totally badass in these.  Must buy if you ask me.
B00IUK0FTS|4|I get compliments every time I wear it.  The size small is slightly too big for me but wearable - I'm 5'4&#34; and 112 lbs. I do wear a white camisole tank under it because the neckline is a little low for me, but I'm also flat chested so it might sit better on someone with curves.  Because I'm pretty short, it's longer on me than on the model in the picture - not quite to the knee, but not short enough to make this 42 year old self conscious.
B00FRI5HDA|4|Bought several more after my first three - great price for the quality.
B00A7R08U8|2|SEE THROUGH! Let's just say when these get wet, you can see everything through them. They claim to be lined but my husband said they aren't really. He wore them once, and we had to buy new ones to replace them.
B001846GPK|5|I am fair with red hair and needed a hat that would protect my face, neck and shoulders from the hot summer sun and this hat does. It fits perfectly and the stretchy headband makes it very comfortable. As indicated in a previous review, the brim is large and most likely can not be used while driving (not in my car anyway).  It does look somewhat like the hat worn by the character in Curious George but, that should not come as a surprise as it is exactly how it appears in the picture. If you are looking for a comfortable hat that will provide great protection from the sun, this is it.
B004LULO9G|5|I love these tanks. I bought 4 in total actually. Two have lace on the bottom while the other two are plain. They have come in so handy as I wear them under everything! A little hot in the summer with two layers as you can obviously see your bra straps if you just wear the tank, but I just make sure to wear something very cool on top.<br /><br />Terrific concept!
B002HPDEOA|5|I am 6' 3&#34; 230 pounds and the extra large size fit very well. I am very pleased with the fit and quality of this costume.
B00L27WFV2|2|Too small and print design was not as pictured
B004AMBUV2|5|This shirt is a gas. If you like Family Guy then this shirt is a must. Great ice breaker at conventions.
B007RFJ6LU|3|it fits just right like...if you bend or try to stretch..it WILL RIP
B00N3SFFN8|5|Excellent
B001FOR2CY|5|very simple and nice belt easy fit<br /><br />muy buena y simple correa ajusta muy bien soy talla 35 diria yo diria que llega un poco mas de 36
B000N8PYRI|3|Very good work pants, in fact they are just about all I wear. My only complaint is that they tend to chafe on the inner thigh and wear out in that area. Quite often i am needing to replace them, not because, for the most part, that the pants are worn out, or torn, but because the inner thigh now have holes in them. So, that is a pain. But other then that, they are good work pants. I just wish i could get more then 4 months out of them for what they cost me.
B00HVWHGF2|5|I love this jumper. It's a bit tricky to get into. Step through the neck, don't try to wiggle in the through the side! I pair it with different belts for different occasions to make it more casual or more formal.
B00CRXF6S4|3|Everything about the vest I love, except it was way too small. I wear an XL and OUCH Had to suck it up, but no can do. I'm an athletic build, football type. I think this vest was meant for the &#34;skinny jeans&#34; type of a person. I would like to by an xxl but I'm afraid it may be too long<br /><br />It's too bad because its a really cool vest and the grey is my shade of grey.
B0056WPVZQ|5|They fit me very well- I'm a demi curve according to the levi website- and I plan on ordering more. They are a very stretchy material for jeans so they're really comfy. The only thing is (as of 12-28-11) the pictures amazon has depicting the blue wonder and onyx wash is switched. I ordered the onyx expecting to get what I saw in the picture, and received a black pair of jeans (what amazon has depicted as blue wonder.) I don't really mind because I like them and planned on ordering them later anyway, but just so you are aware!   *EDIT* The onyx fades really bad after about 2 weeks. The knees have faded to an almost blue and it's really annoying. I have the blue wonder, and after weeks of almost continuous wear they still look new.
B00KCB3EHS|5|Really comfortable!
B00M8QBLHA|3|I bought this in a size 6-9month for my 2.5 year old expecting it to fit well and be somewhat roomy like most of the other Carter's items in that size.  I was disappointed to find that this material (all footies in this material) are too tight in the legs for my little chunker.  They were cut so tightly that he couldn't bend his legs.  It was really disappointing because I purposely returned the exact same item in the 3-6 month size for this issue thinking that a size up would fit, and it doesn't.  They are so soft and sweet that we had hoped it would fit.  We don't seem to have the same problem with the regular cotton footies.  If you have a chubby baby, these may not be the right fit for you.  If you have an average or more slim child these should fit just fine.
B00JK1XS40|5|If you are looking for comfortableness, quality and looks this is it.  I would buy in any color. They are my favorite.
B00KILNLT8|2|I ordered a 4xl and it fit like a size large. The style and color was true to form.
B00P0898IM|5|I wear this at night time and it's very comfortable.
B00JIOLCPQ|5|its perfect
B00BABX848|5|I was hesitant to buy because socks like these always fall down on me. But these stayed in place nicely and weren't too tight at all around my knee area. Comfortable enough to wear for my whole shift at work.
B0085JD1V8|4|This outfit is just adorable! Gorgeous looking, very cute, and perfect for dress-up!<br />It looked absolutely perfect on my 15 months old for thanksgiving dinner.<br /><br />2 things that I have to note though:<br />- This outfit runs VERY small... I had to get a 3T size to fit my daughter (15M). Granted she's on the bigger side, but usually, she fits in 2T.<br />- The jacket is fairly light: don't count on any warmth from this coat...<br /><br />For what I needed it, it was great... The only reason for losing a star was the sizing...
B0030BC3A6|5|I am a 38 DDD in regular bras went a size up for these bras; happy I did. These bras are absolutely wonderful. NO BOUNCE at all and they are comfortable. Needs a few washes to get rid of the stiffness in the strap but other than that no complaints.
B003ZFZEV2|4|I had to fabric glue a couple of the flowers back together after little hands found them. They seem sturdy enough now. They are definately cute. I use them with the crochet headbands for my 3 yr old daughter.
B002IRKJQI|1|Absurdly small even for a skinny woman like myself. I need to return the item. The quality was decent though. Unfortunate that I could not wear it. It should be labeled for children ONLY.
B002QRG720|4|This is a good price but the hat runs small for an average size head.
B002DUCY4K|1|&#34;Hate&#34; because I have depended on Munsingwear for decades - the pouch design is the only one that works for me - and have received orders recently on which the over-all quality has declined disastrously. The leg openings have been comically enlarged, as though big guys with a bit of gut also all have enormously fleshy elephant legs. Such is rarely the case. Most men with a larger than wanted belt size have perfectly normally-sized legs.  And this product has fit me properly up to this time for thirty years. The leg openings now hang loosely rather than providing a comfortable fit. I would chalk this up to &#34;bad batch&#34; if I hadn't experienced it on more than one order spread out over time. Frankly, I'm not sure what to do. Munsingwear has gone from dependable to unwearable for me.
B0077198HQ|5|I like them a lot.
B004UPUIDK|5|Fast arrival, and great product!!! Our one year old was easily the cutest kid in town with (or without ;) ) this costume. Kept him oh so cozy warm and he was even able to walk in it.
B00AYGL4LE|5|I'd like to buy it in several colors,  I like it so well!
B00D9MHRNY|4|I liked it, the quality is good and it is the same size as I expected.
B0042JKU7I|5|Perfect. Ordered 2x after ordering a few turkeys from other manufacturers<br />5 foot 2 , 110 pounds, ordered regular, perfected
B007W0XPUS|2|Runs a big.  I read all the measurements , but it is to big.
B00C3XXAF4|5|Lovely neckline, perfect length on sleeves, fun pattern.  Great fabric.  I love Jones New York.  :). Wish it came in more neutral prints.
B001JYBT8S|5|I bought this for a friend. She opened it at her bridal shower. It is very pretty and a good buy. I think it runs a bit small. My friend is not a 1X. She is a 12 to 14 and it is definitely not too big for her. It comes with a matching thong.
B00EKN87T4|5|This dress is absolutely adorable with the cat print.  It's soft and seems about one size small.  I think the 12 month size I bought seemed more like a nine month.  I have not owned a lot of zutano and this was a gift, but the one piece I did have for my daughter when she was a newborn was much smaller than her other newborn sized chlothes.  It was the only thing that really fit well the first couple weeks...but then it only fit for a couple weeks.  So, if that's any indication, I'd say their chlothes probably run a little small.  A great purchase though!
B000KI3612|5|You can't beat this price for a good, basic coin-decorated scarf.  Perfect for belly dancing practice, or a beginner who doesn't want to spend too much money up-front on accessories.    The product is described as \\"economy imperfect\\", but I didn't see any imperfections.  The fabric is thin and gauzy, not too drapey, but it doesn't really need to drape since most of it is wrapped relatively tightly around your hips.  The color is a really lovely warm orange-gold, almost exactly the same as the color chip for \\"saffron (color)\\" on Wikipedia.  I haven't danced with it much yet, so I can't comment on whether the coins fall off easily.  They do jingle nicely (some other commenters mentioned that their scarves didn't really jingle - I think that the design must vary from scarf to scarf).    I like it enough, I'll be purchasing a few more in other colors.  These are a great way to beef up your dance wardrobe and add some color & jingle without breaking the bank!
B000O7PBDA|4|This is a nice looking belt that I actually owned once before until it wore out.  The oval holes are the best feature as they make the belt easier to fasten.  However, you will probably want to go 2 inches longer than normal because the belt runs smaller than other brands (Perry Ellis for example).
B0072J9RCO|5|Excellent fit great for school
B00UABNGXW|5|I was extremely skeptical ordering this item, but I was pleasantly surprised! I'm 5'1&#34;, 105 pounds, 32C, and the small fit perfectly. However, the shorts are very short, and the top shows a decent amount of side boob. If you want the shorts to be very high waisted they'll probably show your whole butt. If you pull them down a little bit then you'll be okay. I'm pretty short though, so if you're tall then I would size up or you'll have to wear them as low rise. I'm a 32C bordering 32D and the top was almost too small, but without a bra I made it work. Overall it's really cute and it does look just like the picture. Just keep these things in mind!
B00ZGYSO9Y|5|I loved these shorts! they are so cute and I got many compliments and people asking where i got them from so I directed them to amazon. It fit very well stretchy material made it very easy to put on and take off. They are very airy for hot days especially for me living out here in hawaii and going to the beach all the time. They are perfect for ay occasion and you will definitely have people ask where you got them from. I love the print and the material of these shorts. print is very cute and material is nice smooth airy great quality and thankfully not see through :) I received this product in return for my honest review
B00CM7JPKU|4|I like the shirt, great color and fits good.  It is thinner than what I thought by the picture and is a little flimsy, although I like it still.  Comfortable and nice for work.
B00FINQ0KI|5|I love the fit and feel and look of this item :) very pleased
B008MQ74OO|4|They stay put on my 2 year old's hands when she's playing in the snow. She also doesn't complain that her hands get cold, but she generally only stays outside for 30 minutes or so in the snow before she's ready to come in. I'm not sure how they would hold up on a full day of skiing or sledding.
B001TZHYHC|5|I purchased this to use when gardening.<br />It is very sturdy, well-made and comfortable.<br />I appreciate the way it blocks the sunlight, as I cannot be exposed too long.<br />Easy to clean and attractive.
B000V0EPWI|4|scrubs are scrubs.
B00V5YQZXQ|5|Great Product! I have large breast and it is difficult to find a bathing suit that fits good at the top. This bathing suit fits great and is it super comfortable!
B00B1WQEXS|5|was what I thought it was. Also the product didn't cost much but was great quality. Fit just the way I thought it would.
B00EI53YME|5|The shirt was a great fit for me. The price was less than expected and very affordable. The graphics were great and everybody loves it.
B00I03EKQO|5|I bought this for my 11 month granddaughter , and it is wonderful it fits nice and she actually did not wear the pants but she wore the shirt as a little sun dress with matching shoes it was so cute i love this brand.
B00UA5ULZ4|5|Super sexy bathing suit, but not suitable for girls with big boobs. I had a ton of &#34;spillage&#34; as I like to call it. I ended up having to wear my cover up the entire time
B003DSBG3Q|3|The hat is adorable... but it only lasted my a couple usages before it fell off the headband.
B00NQ43XYC|5|I like leggings very supportive and they can be expensive.  This one stretches but surprisingly also hugs fine overall probably due to the fleece.  True high waist which I like, and it is 22&#34; width new, and the zipper reduces the waist from too much stretching although the metal zipper needs be handled with care in order to be able to slide up in the first few uses, and my cotton undershirt shields the bit of metal cold off my belly.  It is not yet washed.  I don't expect it be the same after washes--if it does, I'll come back to say.
B00B3PUES4|5|Wore to a wedding fits great! Received many compliments..I bought a size 8. It has a slight stretch. I'm 5\\"5 and 158 pounds
B003F8BKGW|4|If you are a true True blood fan, you will love this shirt, it was great for a costume party that I went to.
B007NLXBZA|5|Had some doubts about ordering online but went with the size chart and ordered a small/medium. I am 5ft4in, 120 lbs, 38 bust and it fits great! Beautiful dress. Ordered in the grey. Get the sizing right and you will love this!
B009QPSYZS|5|These leggings are nice and warm yet very comfortable. I bought 2 pairs for Christmas and the girls loved them.
B000A82Z8C|5|I bought these for my grandson who is growing so fast, I was afraid that they would not arrive in time for him to get much use out of them. They were shipped within a few days. The size was good. I would say they were &#34;true to size&#34; as far as huskys go. He was satisfied with how they looked on him and so was I!
B00LST2WZI|4|Very soft material and very comfortable.  Sleeves were long enough, which can sometimes be an issue for me.
B00LVE5CXY|5|perfect ,love the  comfortable fit,t the style, and the length will be ordering more jeans from hudson i finally found my kind of jeans.
B00080M1OU|2|I was looking for a wallet that was as slim as possible.  This fit a lot of my needs but the plastic front ripped too easily and now have to replace it 6 months later.
B00XMZIE4O|5|My partner like it
B000HOFB5I|2|Title says it all, the design is cool but the quality is not good at all, since it's made in HAITI it makes sense.
B008HN3WCU|5|Good product, my dougther love it
B0040NP666|5|Just got my jacket!  It's super soft and a beautiful cut.  I have not taken it off since the box came!  Will definitely be ordering more pieces.  Great job!!!!
B003X7P5C0|5|great funny hat for Haturday!
B0042UE5NM|5|These underwear are so comfortable they are a delight to wear!
B007NIBWEA|5|Love it!  Tons of room!  Love all the pockets, I don't have to dig in the bottom of the bag for keys or chapstick.  There is a pocket for everything!
B00J5DO1OY|5|Thankfully I read the reviews first. I'm a size 5/27 in most shorts and jeans. I ordered a XXL and they fit fine. Not too short. I did have to stick a knife through the button hole though because there isn't one cut. Other than that, they're cute!!
B000N4TP7M|4|Very cool shirts!! Mountain T-shirts run VERY large. This is true in all of their shirts that we have bought over the years.
B00IDR8ILU|5|My mom loved her dress. Would buy from here again
B007L7DLT2|1|I ordered one of these shirts from Newbury Comics. The label on this shirt appeared to be an official SOA licensed product and the overall quality was nice.  I bought a Large and the body fit perfectly but as some other reviews have mentioned, the collar was sewn way to small.  I could get it over my head but once the shirt was on, it was choking me.  So I returned it.
B00I3GOZOU|5|Perfect fit and color.
B00UYNHXVW|4|I love the dress! The v neckline is slightly narrower than the photo depicts, but it's pretty & flattering none the less! The fabric wrinkles fairly easily. it's light & flows nicely. I like that the back & front both have the v neck! I'm a 36b, 5'5&#34; & wear 4&#34; heels with it without drag or too much shoe showing. (Size medium) Wear it with a narrow belt because it's a little &#34;balloon-like&#34; in the waist! I also recommend going either bra less or with a crazy low cut bra because the straps are thin & the cut is quite low in both the front & back. Overall I highly recommend it especially for the price
B001KFTDCK|3|Expected a little more quality than received.  Tight to the body. Love the color
B00I3Y36F6|5|Fit is good however a little on the small side for a xxl
B00P68DNYQ|5|Love this dress,great price,and quality,great custumer service,very happy with my purchase
B009E62Z6S|5|The shirt is good quality in color and weight. The printing is perfect. It fit just as described. I have triplets and the 2 girls share in their huge collection of Doctor Who T's.
B00L3XQEZ8|5|good
B0072596ZG|5|Well, I'm always trying to capture the look of when I looked my best in a pair of jeans.  This is IT!
B000RUJJAU|5|I love these! The instructions were easy to follow and allows for multiple applications. The smaller size was perfect for my mouth. (Recommended for a noticeable, but subtle look. Choose the large fangs for a more dramatic effect) I could talk &#34;almost&#34; perfect. Some letters and words were hissed more than spoken. Simple to remove for eating and drinking, then fit easily back into place for the evening. It's the perfect compliment to any vampire costume. I can't wait to show them off for Halloween! So glad I made this purchase, there cool and fun:)
B0024K9X8Y|5|This hooded robe was a gift for my son, a disable veteran.  He was very pleased with the comfort and supreme quality of this product.  And he needs all the comfort he can get.
B0097PD3A8|4|This is the first bro for my 10 old year daugther. She love it, the colors and the soft of the material.
B00A3HHIM8|5|very nice
B003VY3N2Y|5|This has been one of the best jackets I have ever purchased. Super soft, and does what it says .  I read a lot of info on a lot of jackets before buying this one. I am glad I waited to buy this one.
B00GS1BJA0|5|i love it!
B000FWAV70|1|This is not worth the money you spend or the time you spent looking for it. The material is horrible and the workmanship goes right alone with that fact.
B0026SD0CY|1|Our lead tester puts this on the high end of EPA lead safety standards and without the sticker they are clearly breaking the law. I would recommend against purchasing this product. To boot - it's very stiff, not cotton as advertised. Very cheaply made and potentially dangerous if worn out of the box without washing and used on a sweaty head. You could lose IQ points with this product.
B005EE80WC|2|This sleeper was cute but it was way too small for 6-9 months.  He has already out grown it.  That's. All.
B000N8RZ9I|5|Do me just fine , all seem ta fit the same very pleased,pleased pleased,pleased,pleased,pleased,pleased,pleased,pleased,seven,sevenseven new words,flour more words word word
B00IA8QVJI|4|I like everything about it but its too short other than that its awesome.<br />But, for the price you can't complain.
B00CULYVEI|4|Very good
B00420Q6IE|5|These are very soft and stretchy and warm seamless gloves that can easily be pulled back and bunched on wrist when I need them out of the way.  I have arthritis in my hands and got hand splints from Occupational Therapist and these are perfect for under the hand splints.  I like the soft pink and plum colors best!
B00AAN7B5Y|5|excellent
B00JY7FJEW|3|Enjoying the style just doesn't fit like the other wrangler shirts i have in this style.
B00MMMSJLQ|5|They are very comfortable, warm and fit perfectly under the knee
B004RS8V0M|5|Finally, a tshirt bra with support in a large bust size!!  The underwire popped out of mine after about 8 months, but that is kind of to be expected for a bra this size in this price range.
B00C55LSUY|4|Comfortable, true to size and color.  Simple, basic shoe for everyday wear.  Nothing to complain about, just what I wanted.
B00I49S1GE|5|Smells so good! Exactly like chocolate! It's big for a coin purse though
B00MJEIJOY|5|exactly as pictured, good quality - perfect for my halloween costume!
B00QQ3IN8Q|4|shrunk quickly, but still a cute beach cover up
B00EDZAK76|5|Cute as can be!
B00817E046|5|Shirts are fully adorable & cheap ! In the beginning i was skeptical about the size but when i opened the pack; i was extremely stratified with the material as well as size .<br /><br />Thanks
B00GURSUJK|5|Great
B00ET1V07I|5|I am 5'7'' and 120lbs, and I purchased size 6.<br />The size chart suggested me a size 5, but from previous experience I know that these run small, so opted for a larger size and I am very happy with my choice!<br />The fabric is sturdy with a light stretch to it. The panties hug well over the curves, without creating VPLs.<br />I'd say that the waistband comes up to about just over the hip bones for me, which is very comfortable.<br />I am very happy with them, although i have to mention -- colors and prints are not exactly as on the picture, but still with in the range, but this is mentioned in the description of the items so no surprises there.
B00ROM9J54|4|I love all the clothes by kamalikulture.  They are affordable, great fitting and good looking!  I have this dress in 2 colors.  It comes &#34;attached&#34; but it's easier to wear once those strings break.  I'm not even sure if you're supposed to leave it attached.
B009NUIRLM|5|Mustache Cash Stash!!!!!!!  Hamboooooooooooooning!!!!<br /><br />If you need a wallet and are a fan of the regular show you'll love this.  It was considerably better quality then I would have imagined.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Nice<br />-Regular Show<br />-Light<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Probably not enough compartments for people that like full wallets.<br />-The cash area is ... awkward I felt.  It's just almost big enough.
B0095FE0E8|5|it was exactly what I was looking for
B00J4QLCIK|5|Bought a 4x, the tag says 4x but I believe that it may be a 5x... which is still fine, i'm all for getting a larger shirt.
B00BNCP7WA|4|It's a decent reproduction for the money. Doesn't seem quite as heavy as the M1965 I was issued back in the mid seventies but not bad at all. I'm 6' 1\\" 150 lbs with long arms and usually wear a large but ordered a medium per other reviews about these running on the large side, it fits me perfectly. Needs an extra piece of velcro on the cuff. . The quilted liner isn't the same or as heavy as the one I had for my original which was made from some sort of heavy cream colored terrycloth like material covered with green nylon material on the outside. No big deal as I prefer layering anyway but I'm looking around for one of those old heavy liners. All and all I'm quite satisfied with the jacket.
B003ICFBDS|5|I needed these scrunchies for my daughter's 80's costume and they were perfect!  She loved them!<br />And arrived very quickly.
B00L8WBDXW|5|It is a super cute swimsuit and very flattering. I am a mother of two and my tummy isn't what it used to be so it felt great to wear a &#34;bikini&#34; again. I ordered a large and I weigh 130 and 5'2 and wear size 7 jeans. It fit perfect. I would say it runs small since I'm normally a medium.
B003Y7SFAI|5|WHAT IS A EXCELLENT PRODUCT RECOMMEND ALL MY EXPECTATIONS FULFILLED IF POSSIBLE AND WE REQUIRE IN THE FUTURE, buy it AGAIN willingly, TIMELY YOUR CARDS ENTTREGA SELLER
B00E1R8X7A|5|My favorite wallet so far! Fits a couple cards and some folded up cash just fine. Its so small I sometimes have a hard time &#34;pocket checking&#34; on the way out the door ;) It also forces you to get rid of those old membership/club cards you never use
B00FF1B026|5|Really cute scarf.  It was a Christmas gift for my daughter and she loved it.  Product arrived sooner than it was posted to arrive.
B00KB77UBE|5|Cute Olaf shirt!
B00PG7CR8U|4|Was bought for a reception at a wedding. Perfect evening gown girls loved them
B000LXO6ZG|5|Great Jeans all around. My third pair, a little bigger on the size so I would go for a size down.
B005P7N64K|5|Very comfortable.<br />I will buy more soon.. Be sure to check sizing before purchase. They have size charts which are helpful.
B003IT6RP2|5|love it
B00AIKU96M|5|Love these shorts.  So comfortable and flattering.  I got them in my regular jean size 26 and they fit well. I might have been able to go down a size since I'm sure they will stretch out.  They are the perfect length...not too short.
B00JGNQKH4|4|I got the shirt today it's so cute I'm 5&#34;1 and 93 lbs I ordered size s the sleeve fit good a little loose but the body just fit right I think it's a little short for me. I wish it's a little bigger on the body. So far it's cute I'll wear it when I got a chance! I first have a problem with the item not complete ship but I contact the seller and they are good helping.
B007BLDNI2|4|When I received the necklace it was in its orginal packaging and looks great. Only thing is that its actually smaller then it seems in the photo.
B001OAMTQI|5|This is the best 6 pair of cushion socks I have ever worn -- thick and soft to the touch. Best buy for my money!
B00NBYJ6U2|5|Love the colour; a bit large but that's ok in our warm climate.  Comfortable to sleep in.
B00DYEZTT6|5|Got this for my husband, it fitted really good on him and it has like a shiny fabric very elegant but casual at the same time he loved it :)
B003Y50GSE|3|I wanted a skinny white belt.  But this is wider than I hoped for.  It measure more like 1&#34; wide, rather than 1/2&#34; like I had in mind.
B007FWELLK|3|Bought these for work. Haven't used them except around the house because they're see through. Also, it runs large so go down a size. Ordered the medium thinking it would fit fine but even after a few runs in the wash and dryer to shrink they're still too big... and I'm not a small girl to begin with. Perfect for my growing pregnancy belly though. Glad I kept them on hand.
B00ARHO82C|4|Received this top really quickly. The draping is so pretty and it fit just right. Being a little busty, I worried it would be too revealing but the gathering at the shoulders gives it enough softness to accentuate the girls yet modest enough for the office.  The waist is a band of sturdy ribbon type fabric, a little stretchy, so easy to get on/off (cute accent also). Yes....I am very pleased!
B00YAZ8ZDA|2|I received these as promised, but one pair was ripped up the leg. Not very happy about a brand name product being poor in quality.
B00NH6BSLO|5|order larger then your size it fits a bit small but it is comfy and soft and cute too , love the colors, i had to return mine and i have to say the seller's costumer service is awesome super nice and helpful :)
B001NSG4AS|5|They fit wonderfully. The expandable waist is the best part. The fabric is also very nice. I have worn these for about 3 months now and they have held up nicely at work and after multiple washes. No fading yet.
B001GCUK56|5|I had been searching for these pants everywhere.  I own one pair of them and just love them, so when I found them on Amazon, I bought what colors I could get of them.  They were sent very quickly and were exactly what I wanted.
B00GBJGSF0|5|I saw this hat at another festival and was very happy when I received it. It's nice, light weight, and the fur is super soft. It has deep pockets in the paws and an interior zipporred pocket that can hold your phone. I got a ton of compliments wearing this at a festival.
B002ZNZJII|5|Best Wallet Ever!  This is the best wallet I have ever had. It is 100% full grain leather and has excellent stitching. I am confident I will use this wallet for the rest of my life (barring losing it).<br /><br />It took about a week to break in--as with actual real leather and it fantastic.  I only carry about 6-8 cards and some cash. This is a tad thicker than my past wallets, but perfect for jeans and fits well in slacks too.  I considered going with the Saddleback front pocket wallet, but I am just too used to bifolds. This wallet has exactly what you need and is extremely reliable. The cards fit in the slots perfectly and will not fall out. After a little use the slots loosen up a little bit, but just enough to be able to slide cards out.<br /><br />Not for Metro users. I use my DC metro card everyday. Since this is a great wallet, is thick and has RIFD protection, the metro reader will not read the card through the wallet.  So i put the card in the frontmost slot on the left, and open up my wallet to scan the card---works &#34;almost&#34; every time.  But small price to pay for such a great wallet.
B00L2I62O2|4|Nice smooth 100% cotton shirt. I normally prefer blends, especially the triblend, for the softness and shape retention, but this is good. Guardians!
B00CJIYXO0|5|My 6 year old granddaughter wore this dress to the NutCracker ballet and she looked just like a sugar plum fairy in the ballet. She loved it!!
B00MQ62G3U|3|Not enough elasticity - just kind of hangs.
B00UAULEQE|4|Luv this! Fit is a little small. Order a size up if you like your sweatshirts to fit loose.
B00NDPHBL0|5|Honestly, I've decided that when it comes to us plus sized ladies, there's no going wrong with eVogues. This shirt is absolutely perfect and I love it. omg. And like.....it's SO flattering!!!!!! what is this witchcraft????  I have a faux leather vest from them as well that's soo sexy. This designer is perfect.
B00VVLMXN4|4|Very nice.  Light summer long sleeve.
B009FUBA9Q|4|The look of the dress is beautiful. You can't tell from the pic but there are tons of black beads in lines on the dress. That was a surprise to me. The beads are sewn on a thin piece of silk and the the dress is lined in polyester. The description says 100% silk so I was thinking it would be indeed that. I was disappointed with that. Also it says made in the USA but the tag on the dress says made in China. I called the maker of the dress and they said that some of their beaded dresses are made in China. That was another disappointment. Even with my disappointments I still like the dress well enough to keep. It's very eye catching. It's very delicate due to the beads and thin silk so it's not something I will b wearing a ton. I'm actually going to go through and sew the beads on better so that it stays looking nice. If you are looking to stand out this dress has a statement of it's own. I'm usually a size 6 and the M fits me good.
B00VYIEKEY|4|Love it
B00KXBUIIA|5|Very happy with shirt and company. Very cute shirt
B00K6O4EMK|1|I would give 5 stars but I've received the wrong vest! I ended up with a native american design on the BACK of the vest! I have contacted the seller and I did not get a response back. It was a Christmas gift and I thank GOD that my son is not a picky person! Oh and one more thing....If you're a small get a small or maybe a medium. I read the reviews before I ordered the vest and bought it 2X's bigger. It's too big for my son.  I think  guys that are a little over weight are writting the reviews with &#34;It's too snugged&#34; or &#34;It runs small&#34;.....This my friend(s) is not the case! If I would have ordered a medium, it would have been fine!
B008R6ZCAM|5|Good quality.
B00JEYRY16|5|Beautiful
B0113GI470|5|I bought this suit for my son. It was a perfect fit with a adjustable waist band. Surprised the tux was 64 dollars and fit so well. Thank you this is our third suit purchasing from Alain Dupetit and definitely not our last.
B008MNOMRE|5|Fast getting here, and had to get in touch with them, they answered back soon & fixed my mistake.  Good tshirt too
B00SS4PL5Y|4|good product
B000WNLH52|5|this is perfect for my wedding! it has small holes on the band so you can use bobby pins to fasten it in your hair and the design is beautiful! I think the small flowers with the touches of sparkle are just perfect and not too &#34;over the top&#34; The band was flexible enough that I could adjust it to my head. The size is definitely for adults though- not children.  That was A concern when I first saw it, but it was perfect for me.
B001DT95OO|4|I would have rated this product 5 stars but I was specifically searching for a red and blue tie to coordinate with a vest that I had purchased that was navy and burgundy. Though I was pleased with the quality of the product I was not pleased that I received a light blue tie instead of the tie depicted, the shirt that arrived was the same color as the picture.  Be aware that you may not receive the exact item shown.
B005XLTH32|5|Best leggings ever! You can not see through them. They are long which works for me since I am 5'10'. Very comfortable I wear a size 10 and ordered a medium. Just PERFECT!
B00CEBKHPG|5|no padding but still beautiful
B00K034Z0I|5|Really love this. I can't wait to find more
B008CQ5Q94|2|It has an awesome color, and its a great male wig, but it was a little small.  the band needs to be bigger, if you have a bigger skull. I recommend not getting this wig.
B00UO6EG9Q|4|I purchased two waist trainers one for me in xs and one for my mother in a 3x.<br />It took a week to ship and I was skeptical at first because this product came from hangzhou China but it shipped rather quickly and I couldn't be happier with the product. At first it will fit a tad bit tight but the second day it was snug enough for me to freely adjust it. My mom absolutly loved hers as did I. I have no complaints it actually helped my posture a bit.
B00AG8DJZ4|5|Cool shorts
B0024KF338|3|It is very big for the size but it shrank up a lot the first wash.  it is also not very soft or well made.
B0007NUGCC|3|They fit but would have liked them a little bigger.
B00EODNKMY|5|Superb fit and cut. Got compliments the first day I wore them. Built to last as well.
B00QHBKJ4S|5|So cute!
B00P8ZYO9K|5|The bra offers me good underarm coverage. It is also pretty.
B00AIYBAFW|5|i love it
B00OUCQNXC|1|Was sent a size I didnt order. Sending it back!
B009AO5SFY|4|Thin fabric, but I only wear them under maxi skirts so they work well for my needs.
B00GXJEDBO|3|the design was stretched /.- but other than that there great  id wish there was a larger size but its all good
B00SUQAB7S|1|I ordered a large which fits my daughter who wheres a size 3 and 32 bust size us. If you are bigger breasted do not order because this suit is not forgiving and will not fit. Dont waste your $$
B00LU36X1Q|4|Tends to shrink with each wash. They are comfortable and somewhat soft (not like 100% white cotton). Unlike VS pj's, these tend to lose the shape with each was. Color also fades away, but not significant enough to be dissatisfied with it.
B004RB37KS|5|Great costume for a good price.
B003OESWXQ|5|can you possibly swim in these? i want something to be able to run in and also swim in for the summer! if anyone can answer that would be helpful! thank you:)
B002WT7IQQ|5|I wore the jacket a fee times it is very flexible and the sleeves are long enough<br />so that when reaching over head they pull up you forearm rain bounces off and is warm for its weigh very pleased greg
B00ARFWHQI|4|Extremely comfortable and grest at hiding body flaws. You can loose or gain a few lbs and the ddress still looks and feels great
B00EUBDJIU|5|Very good fit.  A white panty can be seen but a dark panty can not be seen as well.  Can be worn everywhere.
B003L6XFK2|1|Too long to begin with , and then it stretches way too much also
B00PU0FKW8|5|Adorable pajama's! They fit well with room to grow. Very happy with my purchase.
B00M2ECI34|3|Very thin material
B00QM93P2I|5|Absolutely LOVE this dress and so does everyone else, got complements all night! I'm 5'4 170 ish, 34dd and bought a size large. Fit PERFECTLY
B00CIZLTZA|4|its kind of smart design but i think its a little uncomfortable. I still wear it a lot though... youll get used to it
B0064YY8TK|5|I love it! The bra has underwires but is unlined, which I don't like but does probable make it fit more people (?)  It makes my clothes fit and look better but is comfortable for 12 plus hours. Has a snap crotch, not a pull-apart and pee-all-over-yourself-one. I just ordered another one in black! A great value at this price- just saw one in the store for $62.00!!
B00HXL9IAC|5|Picture does mot give this dress justice. Beautiful,  great priced. Would of had to pay double at a boutiqe. Washex u<br /> Great.
B00QRCLNV0|5|Not too tight, fits just right.
B00I5EDT42|5|Warm, nicely lined girls' jacket.  Great zippered pockets,  nice sized hood and great length sleeves make this jacket my daughter's new favorite go to coat, all for a modest price.  Quite warm for a lighter jacket.  Very stylish!
B001AJ6LLC|3|This tie clip looks great and is well constructed.  This tie clip is a little short though.  I wear normal sized ties and it is doesn't quite cross it like it should.  I also have to adjust it often.  All in all it is a really nice looking tie clip for thinner ties.
B008HHMCX6|1|First, they sent me the WRONG item.  I ordered these in plenty of advance for a trip we were taking, and since they sent the wrong item, I had to return them. THEN, they only refunded me for 2 of 3 packages!  NOT HAPPY.  Fililng claim with Amazon and if that doesn't work, filing claim with my bank card.
B009L1O12C|4|This  stuff is A-Maze-ing. Easy to swim in. Easy to dry, a great product at a great price. Sho Nuff.
B00GFG1LGA|5|My daughter loves this pajama
B002YSYV9W|3|I like the length of the robe; however, it was not wide enough.  The next widest size is way too long:(
B009T4HZ5G|5|Been wearing it for week now, and it fits me well. Not too tight, but snug enough. The leather ends feel like they're higher quality than my last belt, so I hope that this one won't start splitting like it did. Even though the cloth part of the belt has elastic in it, the elastic is ingrained in the woven cloth and it's wide enough that it doesn't feel like it's cinching my waist too much.
B00U2S08BQ|5|Great shirt for the price
B007PM7KF4|2|the purpose of the garter belt is to hold up compression hose my wife has to wear.  after a couple time using the garter belt, the connections, that connect the garter belt to the hose, created holes in the compression hose,  the compression hose cost about $80, and the garter belt connectors are ruining them. will have to shop elsewhere to find something that doesn't tear up the hose.
B0014BMKHK|5|These are exactly what I was looking for.  Nice.  Well made and fit well.  I wish they came in navy and some other colors in petites, but love the ones I have.
B0002TOZ1O|4|Very nice socks.
B00JPEPOBM|5|I have looked for a great supportive bra for a year now! I FINALLY FOUND IT! The price is great too. I actually ended up ordering 5 more! When you find a good bra, you stock up!
B009P0E4QW|5|Great shirt, fits and looks great!
B00IK2H5AS|5|Wore these to a St Patty's Day party and they were a big hit!  Very comfortable for everyday wear too.  Loved them!
B00U2W4MIW|5|Love it
B00RSSA14W|5|Love it
B00JFI7LR8|1|Case cracked the first time I put it on my phone
B0031U0POM|5|i like it
B00JKW24US|1|The tights did not go up to my waist and the material is cheap.
B00LNH4RHG|5|Thank youu very muchh fits very well :)
B00CA4VU8A|4|I'm 5'8 but have pretty short legs for my height, 27 in waist and 38 inch hips and can never find pants that don't need a belt (got the size 28). However, these are great in that regard. The only problem is that they are an inch too short, so I have to either wear boots or show off my ankles.
B00IGPB9G0|5|Love it
B00GWC8NRC|5|This dress was just right and the material was not clingy a very comfortable fit.  If you are a full figured woman the jacket of this outfit hides all your imperfections.  I am only 5'4&#34; so the hemline hit me just below the knees, which is where I like it. While wearing the dress I did spill some Alfredo Sauce on it; when I got home I just put some stain remover on it and hand washed, hung dry and the dress was fine.  Also this material dries very fast.
B00IRZ0S20|3|I have to have it altered...cause its takes time to return it and cant wait that long...!!
B00UMWPPS8|5|Beautiful,  great quality.
B000Q7B6Z0|5|It fit great it's not to tight, but really do hold me in.
B000MXLZ3G|5|Fit fine.
B00ALNPK4M|5|I ordered using Prime and this outfit was at my doorstep within a blink of an eye. Okay, I am exaggerating but it did come really fast (and free). I purchased this item hoping it would not run small and it doesn't (yeaaaaa)! It is made well and is a really nice outfit that can be worn in the late Spring and Summer. My daughter normally wears a 3T as she is tall and solid. Since the pants are capri's, no one would notice if they were high waters so I gave them a try in 2T since all the 3T's were sold out. It was a good decision and they fit better than expected because the waist was not tight and will last her (hopefully) the whole summer.
B00369TXMI|5|I have a hard time finding a bra that can keep my breast separated, but this one works well. It gives great support, too.
B00N3FN0JC|5|This was a really good buy. I love the way it flatters my body, its very comfortable. I wish that I could get this in other colors. I get a lot of compliments when I wear it.
B00J5AR7TS|5|Would recommend this
B00F0M7BPU|4|Warm pjs - good fit
B0024VFRX8|5|GREAT PATCH
B00A5TLRI0|5|These are great for the winter months.  They make me feel warm while they look great.  I wouldn't trade them for anything.
B005QR770S|2|I've noticed that some parts of the gloves seems to be shedding because it's not durable in the least. I understand its a light commuter gloves but it's still a disappointing product from Timberland. I haven't even washed it yet; so I figured If I did, it might deteriorate the entire gloves.
B00UJ3PF58|5|Good
B00FPETZ2A|5|I like it very much and my daughter also! I even didn't expected such nice quality and real great winter jacket! Love it!
B00SBF2C8O|5|Goood
B007KFZDPU|4|I'm 69 and whenever I wear a bathing suit, I must wear a bra under the top to limit the effect of somewhat unequal sized breasts. This sports bra minimizes my problem well without the appearance of ordinary bra straps.  And It has the added advantage of a modesty shield in the bathing suit neckline. Nice solid feel, comfortable, at a price I was willing to pay.  With this, I'll be willing to join my family at the beach.or even be seen at a pool.on vacation.
B0003DKW9I|5|Tall Perry suspenders are excellent. You do have to wear a belt but you don't have to worry about clips. All plastic so excellent for travel with a belt lacking metal.
B00HPW4Z70|4|Nice body
B009F6HP7G|5|These are great, very soft
B00ADCB8RE|3|I received this with a hole in the shoulder area.  The company was nice about it though.  I ended up keeping it and will have it repaired.  Warm and soft.  Fits good... have no idea if they are all defective or not.  If it had not had the whole I would have given 5 stars.
B00E879OGM|5|I love these dresses. Great fabric and great price. I've regifted them to other pregnant mamas and they also love them. I also have a short-sleeved version. I have worn after pregnancy and my pre-pregnancy size, and they still work well. Can also nurse due to cowl neckline.
B008Q0E5HK|5|Bought this as a gift for my daughter to give to a friend of ours and she LOVED them!! she calls herself a scarf freak and she liked the fact you could mix/match them with the bundle or with the scarfs she owns...great gift!!
B0067OTN4W|5|Never have to think about these when they're on.  They are so comfortable!  I'll never switch!
B00E8HF7J0|5|Everything is great, I love it.
B00K5AFQ22|4|I like the size and weight, my only criticism would be the clip that holds bills in place seems a little weak.
B0097L59SG|5|Beautiful dress
B00FARBARU|4|Good t-shirt. = )
B00HMU3FJ4|3|Low quality stretched image and it is going the opposite direction then image that is shown to the buyer. Not worth the price paid.
B00SFPUHCS|2|i loved the studs on the sleeves, but its huge! I wanted it a little bit larger so it was loose fitting. I ordered a large and it looks like a 3x
B0078YZGZ0|5|This ended up being a really cute costume. I did have to do some adjustments with the skirt, it was EXTREMELY short. I purchased two extra petty coats (none come with the costume) and sewed them underneath. This made the skirt bounce well and made the skirt a more respectable lenth.
B00NKE4XHE|5|It fit perfectly and was in good quality and detail. Much nicer than the Anna dresses that you see in local toy departments like at walmart or target
B00K4XQRYQ|4|Cute and keeps my daughter warm
B00BMH68I8|4|love this dress, Im size 8, this dress was some what slight small, unable to exchange seller have no size 8.
B00LA2SO5K|5|I wear a vest and tie to work everyday and have found it hard to find good quality vests. These are my new favorite item in the closet. They are thick and will keep you warm in the cold, but they are not too bad to wear in the summer here in TX. The 2 pockets are sewn closed and they are not all that deep when cut open. I do feel like I am going to tear off the buttons when I am taking the vest on and off, but a little extra thread made them solid.    I received the 3 vests I have ordered weeks (2+) earlier than was stated. This, I am sure, is not always going happen but it was a very nice surprise.    Over all if you want to look sharp without having to throw on a jacket, grab one or more of these vests.
B0042CEFGW|3|Loved the color and thickness however they had no shape on the foot and didn't hug your feet tightly like they should. Foot part was huge.
B00IXX7SN8|5|My wife looks hot in this... yea, sorry, couldn't resist the pun :-)<br /><br />It's a t-shirt with a print, what can I say. It fit, it looks good and my wife loves it.
B000JGA4N8|1|The fit is perfect, but the quality is awful. Very thin, flimsy material.
B008U0KLNS|5|They fit great.
B0088EYPEC|5|Great price... looks good and love the leather smell who don't??! Lol. Gave it to husband it was time for a new one. Great price and purchase (:
B00VIQM5CQ|5|I love this compact yet spacious wallet. The leather is soft. I can fit all my cards (16) in this wallet. The cards I don't use often are stacked in a couple pockets. Plenty of room for cash. Even though cards fit in tight I still have room to make wallet thicker with cash and still snap it. There is not a lot of room for coins, but I'm ok with that as I just empty them in a piggy bank!
B00006M009|5|My husband bought one of these shirts last year to try it out. I was very skeptical of the &quot;no ironing&quot; claim. I couldn't believe my eyes when I took it out of the dryer the first time -- not a wrinkle to be seen. The material is truly miraculous. We both love this product and plan to buy more. Thank you, Jos. Banks!
B00FZ4AVQ4|4|Nice fit and feel. Nice to get what was ordered.
B000Q7DD38|5|thank you very much for the opportunity to express myself ... the article that came as it acquired as requested in excellent condition and with the same features that were presented on the page .. so my valuation is excellent ....
B0089KAHCE|5|This is the second jacket i got. I love it one of the best. Got same for my 6 years old son to. Highly recommended.
B007NLXBZA|4|This is a great dress! No doubt. I ordered red but got it a little dark, however I'm honestly fine with that. I actually prefer the darker shade of red! The size was true! It fit me like a glove, showed off my curves, when my boyfriend saw me in this, he even said \\"Wow\\" just that wow made my day. It's light and fresh, perfect for the summer, you can wear it at any time of the day, even though when I wear it I feel like I'm heading to a medieval event. :3 but anyway, it's great, however by the end of the day on the first use I did notice some seams coming undone. However, it's really not a big deal since no one can really notice unless they put their face up close. So other than the seams problem, I find this dress great! :D Definitely would love to get more dresses like this in the future!
B00544BUJ2|1|I've never had a medium fit that small.  I 'm wondering if I should by a large or even an extra large.  I have it to my Daughter who is an extra small.
B002RH579S|5|I have a leather vest that i have been putting patches so needless to say when i saw this i had to have it. This patch is just awesome the ace of spades is my favorite card i love this patch.
B00BMJ00I0|5|I don't know about other people, but I have a vast majority of cards that I keep in my wallet. I usually have to put one behind the other to make room for all of them in a regular wallet. The Kloud (with 18 credit card slots) holds them all. This is one heavy duty miracle wallet. You can tell by the feel of it when you hold it in your hand that it's going to last until you decide to purchase another wallet. The colors are quite vibrant (exactly as pictured) so you have the aesthetic appeal as well as something that is functional. I was pleasantly surprised when I received it. Even after reading the good reviews I did not expect to just be blown away with all the space. I would recommend this purchase to anyone and I will be purchasing again if need be (or if they come out with new flashy colors!)
B00L332FC4|3|The material is nice but the cut is way too small
B00CJ94G5U|3|The dress seemed to be well made, however the zipper became detached from the back of the dress while wearing.  Fabulous style, just not too sure how long the items will last.
B0018R3YKW|5|I can never find jeans that fit nice, look good and are priced right. These 529 curvy boot cut jeans are all of the above. I am 5'4\\" and have always had a healthy butt and a waist about 2 pants sizes smaller. In the past the low rise jeans helped a bit but as a 35 year old woman the need to bend over without plumber crack was a necessity. Also I found that if I wore jeans that fit me while standing up, as soon as I sat down there was a huge gap in the back. I hate that! I was resigned to finding jeans that will have to do. No longer!!!!!!!!! These jeans rock! I am going to buy 100 pairs. If you are a woman with some \\"assets\\" try these you will not be sorry!
B00118BK68|5|Looks like the real thing (or close enough to fool people under jeans) plus this shoe is truly comfy. Leather is quality and there is enough padding to make a 4\\" shoe feel (almost) squishy - the platform front which slightly offsets the heel height helps too.  I normally wear and 8 and ordered an 8.5, because I read that Oh! Deer recommends ordering one half-size up. I found the larger size was a bit too long in the heel, but I have an 8 in their boots which feels tight, so it may be a \\"deal with it for the sake of fashion\\" sacrifice. However,the toe box is a decent size in my 8.5, which is nice since peep toes tend to smash my piggies...i suppose your size depends on whether you want to walk daintily so they don't fall off, or hobble around a little smushed in. Other than that = gooorgeous!
B00BUISAZS|5|This scarf is worth more than what I paid, I've paid for others that are less quality but more pricey.  Its soft with almost a silky texture. Definitely worth the purchase.  I received it faster than expected.  Excellent gift for any occasion.
B00CKLIJWI|5|This does run large as other reviewers have stated, but I do like that in cardigans. It's also an odd material, like a loose fitting Spandex. I do like it so I am planning on keeping it and wearing it often.
B005OOUJNK|5|Pretty and well made, however, the knit is very fine and delicate so watch what accessories you wear with it.
B00GS714F4|4|good product somewhat small
B00HHDTK36|5|I need the Ivory shirt for the wedding and they came on and a prefect fix.  And the price was good. I had been to every store in Augusta GA and no one had a Ivory shirt.
B00N415R2S|3|its cute but was too large
B00B7MRXY6|1|Don't buy ripped before I got to use it!!!
B00HUF5UG2|3|These shorts were cute & served the purpose of covering up my sons legs during the summer months but they had a feminine cut (like cheerleader shorts) and the stitching wasn't the best. We ordered 6 shorts & 2 of them were messed up. But Amazon quickly sent us replacements. The sizing was spot on for my 6-9 month son.
B009HY96SM|5|Angry Birds back to do his thing. The shirt is of good quality and the sizing was perfect. Recommend to all
B0032YZMH2|5|I'm tall and slim (6' 1&#34;, 185 lbs.) and most shorts are either built for skinny skateboarders or guys heavier than me. These fit just right. I like the rivets at the seams, too.
B001BKJ91O|2|I ordered two of these for summer camp for my children and one of the backpack's strings untied on the first day of use for which I immediately contacted the seller and their reply was 'Unfortunately, we cannot provide refunds or replacements for products damaged through use.'  They also suggested that I retie it on my own which I tried and could not do.  The other backpack got tears in it after a few weeks of use. Will never buy this again.
B001RILVOS|5|i love it<br />I am a huge hockey fan so this is just right for me. I will  look for other things also
B00CBWYT7K|5|It's so soft and sexy looking - very breathable; nothing but comfort. Love It!!!
B0089KLGME|5|Just what I wanted.
B00JPKOULG|3|My mistake so often for not reading the specs, I thought this was a jersey top and it is that polyester picky stuff.  I kept it because it is pretty and VERY sheer so have to wear with a tank underneath. Pretty color.
B000N3V7QU|5|great quality and great product
B000E44J36|1|The service is horrible! Nothing was received but the money was charged! I have to call back after 2 month to get my money back.
B00G4C2DG2|5|Love this shirt!!!
B00O85GKNE|5|Love this high quality very warm hat, great buy.
B00GACJA76|5|I bought the hat for my grandson and going to send to Europe. I love it. The quality is great. I think he will love his new hat.
B00GG0NY7Y|4|This works but it's hard to position.  Or maybe it's just hard for me to position.  They are longer than i expected and not adjustable.  But they help keep straps on my shoulders
B003WOL140|5|Nice work shirt and not a heavy material
B00GUUUWWU|5|Excelent product
B00K1FW2A0|5|I have had this body shaper before so I knew that it would be the correct size. I like it because it gives my back added support as well as the shaping aspect.
B00CWDV8VI|4|Good fit, nice fabric and value for money
B00H5IONN0|5|love it
B00FK8FUZM|4|This coat is Just a little small for its size but still fits me nicely. The main part I don't care for is the fact that the listing on amazon does not clearly label it as a Light jacket. I had no idea if it was a light or a heavy jacket.
B00I485A46|2|My daughter loved opening these and just loved them, but unfortunately, she wore these once and they are already unraveling.  I may return or have someone I know try sewing them.
B00REO4O7U|3|Nice Shirt, looks good. I suggest buying a size larger than you need.
B00RUE4H6W|1|The seam came apart after only 2 washes on all 3 pairs.
B001FSK3UI|5|I bought this item for my husband.  He really likes it.  He likes the fact he can use it with different outfits because it can go either black or brown.  The sizing was accurate also.
B00B1FCC2W|5|Our favorite T shirt brand.  Great colors and graphics. Great fit, not too short. Wears a long time. Fast shipping.
B00DD19GNU|4|Material looks/feels good quality. I am 6ft 1 inch and ordered X Large coz a reviewer said they shrink on washing. They are a trifle large but if they shrink modestly then will be perfect fit otherwise I guessed wrong and should've ordered Large. Anyway, so far so good.  $14.99 price is a bargain.
B0085IGV16|4|It is a little longer than I anticipated, but it appears to be durable and fits well.  The extra belts loops on the back help with the fit.
B00R97YVR0|5|Its a little long but love it
B008FVOEDA|2|Ordered this item despite my gut telling me that anything sized zero to 6 months would not work.  Sure enough, it is ridiculously too large for my 4 month old.  It's more like for a one year old, or the 8 to 10 month old setting the 100 percentile.  How it would fit a newborn is beyond ridiculous and why they'd even try to cover such an age span is more senseless than my wishful hormonal induced thinking.  Plan to return it, of course.
B00ICETWHS|5|Beautiful, just as expected. Great colors. Its a bit bulky and slips off. I got three of these for my grandmother who is going through chemo and losing her hair. Much better price than the pre tied &#34;cancer&#34; head scarves. These one have multiple purposes. And she loves them.
B005IGBDIO|5|Very satisfied.
B00DZENXJS|3|I'm a size 10. The dress fits size 8, but not 10 as advertised. It looks so stretched on me and fits more as a top.
B00061RX6W|5|confortable
B00GS18UNE|4|My husband loved it !
B003TT0D2E|4|This is a very nice costume. Its pretty well made and the best part is, its not one of those skanky costumes that show your ass cheeks. Its still sexy, but you dont have to be worried about bending over because this skirt actually goes down to about your knees. The only party I was unhappy about was that its supposed to be a pencil skirt but it actually kind of flares out at the bottom so I did have to alter it a little bit. I also took the fake looking medals off and bought some real ones from an online army navy store.
B00AQRLZR4|5|LOVE THESE SCARVES!!!!
B00EM2JKSA|3|Good Quality and fit as expected
B00149YRB4|5|I got these sunglasses, and absolutely love them.  They are super cute and stylish!  My 3 month old keeps them on, and they don't seem to bother her.  The had piece is a little large for her tiny head, but I'm able to get them to stay for the most part.  We are going to FL in a couple of days, and I plan to definitely get great use out of these!  She will be mostly shaded, but I think they will come in handy in the pool, etc where the reflection off the water could always get her eyes.
B00B5W9QDY|5|Awesome shirt! Love it! It's my new favorite.
B00DEODICG|5|Super cute! Received tons of compliments!
