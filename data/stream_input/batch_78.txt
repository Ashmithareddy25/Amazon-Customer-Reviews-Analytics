B000P6UO2I|2|Came with missing parts (battery clamps).
B000CLSMF2|2|Not a perfect fit.  had to grind a little on the tip touching the wheel cylinder in order to fit.  Luckily I have some time to do it.  other than that, if your time is more important than your money I suggest getting a different brand if you own 2005 dodge neon sxt.  I really did not notice any difference between a 10 year old break shoe and this one.  noise sounds louder than my 10 year old break shoe.  I guess the ThermoQuiet is really just part of the name brand, not the actual feature.
B002ZTGLFC|5|I really got hosed on this purchase.
B00MFQJRDI|4|The mounting bracket is a bit flimsy and the hose seems low to medium grade. Overall it's good, it works, looks good, and is dirt cheap.<br /><br />For my YZF-R6S I had to get creative but I made it work. Just flatten the mounting bracket and use it as a stand so the hose can run under the reservoir over to the brake handle.
B00QF6GS7M|5|Love mine, had it for 3 months no issues have jumped a 39,000 lbs. Diesel line truck.
B00390NZHI|5|Product looks great.  Only issue is installing onto a 2015 JKUR driver side fog light.  It's the product issue, but very difficult removing two screws.
B000BZLNBY|5|on time and correct, thank you
B00EQZEXBW|5|love this shirt.  good, sturdy material that will last, but not overly bulky
B007CN9IJW|3|I wanted the seat belt clips to stop the back seat belts from tightening up on people but they did not work for that.  They did work for me, the driver, to keep seat belt in one place.
B005LQ7T0W|5|This is a super USA made product, I purchased 2 types from Luxor both are great. The cart is easy to assemble wont rust and is light weight at the same time being strong enough to do the job.
B00651C4EI|3|reception was degraded significantly from stock antenna
B00BCRMA9Y|3|the front covers fit really good but I did not like the rear covers since my trucks seats do not fold down I could cot get the covers around the back rest and also its a 60/40 rear seat so it did not fit right. I have a Toyota tundra double cab by the way.
B00YJ8ZIOW|5|looks great. Was going to use it on a hat, but ended up putting on back of leather vest
B006LIZ3D4|5|Love them
B00XZ9MYRA|5|It works great for my 2005 Mazda 6s...Easy and fast programming
B00PBO0Z3M|4|great fit, and love that they came with all the bulbs needed.
B000C7TVYW|4|Fuel tank fit my truck perfectly! The box it came in was damaged and there were minor dents on the tank, but did not affect the fit or function.
B001Y8NDM4|5|Great!
B000FW2O1G|4|I bought this gauge for testing vacuum only and it is a bit hard to read with all of the other values displayed on the face. I like that it'll do other things but if all you need is a vacuum gauge, others will be easier to use.
B001FCB4JS|5|Great stuff. works!!!!!!
B00M78820I|4|It's a little small for my 2013 Hyundai Accent, but it does the job.
B00KYS2WYA|5|Lucas Oil products are awesome!!!  I found them at the Jeep/4x4 store I go to locally.  Last time I went to buy there, I had to stand in line for 20 min, and never did get to the counter so I put them back and drove home hoping I could find them on Anazon.  This package deal is awesome and I'll definitely order again. The interior detailed makes faded out dash areas in my Jeep, the spare tire cover, the vinyl backing on my seats ALL look brand new and glossy!!  Such a great product. Thanks for having them available Amazon!!
B01147QPP6|5|Cheap and bright!
B00NT3G8EM|5|It fit the 2006 slk 280 perfect.
B003VASAR6|5|This is a great replacement foot for our awning.  It was a direct fit, and great price.
B00H9V12LE|5|I liked the decal, very nice looking.
B00RW3R08I|4|Look great. Arrived quickly. I needed to add a star washer to keep the arms from vibrating loose.
B00BITJ116|5|perfectly matched my other handles!
B00KGGTF9U|4|Although the sun shield is exactly as described, The Amazon notice that it would fit my 2015 Ford escape was incorrect. It is actually too small for the windshield. The measurements were clearly stated, but I did not know the measurements, and trusted the &#34;This will fit your car&#34;. That was my mistake. Measure your windshield before you buy. Other than that. it is a nice design, and very portable.
B004GINT14|5|Easy to install and works great!
B000EJ6QLO|5|I use these on my fleet of Crown Victorias and they do a great job.
B002MESVUI|4|My daughter had a minor traffic bump in her Civic and broke the tabs off of one headlight, so I got these for the same price as most used single headlight assemblies I found on e-bay. Once I managed to bang and bend the frame section back into place, the fit and finish were very good. The aiming is proving to be a bit tricky, and it would certainly help if instructions were included. Overall, a good product for a very reasonable price.
B009D21UIC|5|Quality part.  Had extra sheathing around contact part with frame that original cable was lacking.  Smooth operation, fits right on my 1984 XJ 550 Seca.
B001GG6C7M|5|Thank you
B000C30J3I|5|This is one of the best belts you can get. It's a shame that auto parts stores don't carry it. This is a very grippy belt.
B00AUIAVWY|5|awesome!
B00IQCBQ0M|5|great
B001L9ZBZS|5|Got it, thank you. Do you have ones a lot better, want one for my windshield
9539751047|5|no place better
B00WCHLD7I|5|Excelente!!!!!!!
B000YS9P54|1|I conect it to my car in a four hour trip and never cool the cans
B00KM9139Q|5|Fit perfectly.  Came on time
B00DGRRRKA|5|Bolted right up to replace the poorly designed Teves calipers.
B000BQWHDQ|4|Easy to install.
B00MJLIXHA|5|Great quality product
B007KPR3IA|4|Arrived as expected
B00LJJTTCG|5|I liked it, very nice decal.
B00CGK0P4S|5|fits perfect
B00KRH1JKQ|5|Easy install once you get over the fear of plunge cutting into your bumper.  Really adds to the overall aesthetic.  Couldn't be happier with the product and the purchase.
B005GYAKVO|3|Works okay, but very difficult to put in place because it is just slightly too large for the windshield.  Would not buy it again.
B00D9C2CDO|5|It worked very well was easy to tie down.
B0036QX4EY|5|Good solid stand, easy assembly.. I trust my bike on it!
B00KSZ5F5C|5|I originally bought this to cover a desk I was making and boy was i surprised. The desk came out looking good and I still have almost half of it left. I may do some trim inside my car. Not sure how it will hold up in the weather outside of a car, but inside should be fine. I would highly recommend a $20 heat gun from Home Depot and NOT a hair drier. A heat gun made this go way faster and was really easy considering i covered an 8ft x 2ft board alone. I've never bought carbon vinyl so im not sure what the difference is between the $150 roll the same size, but i like this plenty enough for what i paid.
B0086I9TQ4|5|Came as advertised, great value.
B00480J44G|5|Always a high quality product
B00J4Z9I8W|5|Install piece of cake  exactly what I needed.
B00FPL0LV2|5|works perfectly! my window works great now. easy installation. Took about 20 minutes total.
B0103LQBM6|5|Yes
B00PI6PH36|5|Awesome lights
B005DUN0OU|5|I ordered this to replace the soft aluminum OEM sprocket on my '07 BMW G650 XChallenge.  The sprocket fit perfectly, and appears to be very high quality.
B008A5Y0PS|5|Excellent
B0021VM4J6|4|Easy install. Check Youtube for videos. The videos were very helpful. The videos I watched were of kits from other companies but almost the same as the Zone Offroad kit. I Installed the kit a couple months ago no issues. Took around 3 hours then I had new tires installed and the truck aligned. Looks great.
B00YDNX3SQ|5|Best helmet I have ever owned.  Light and no wind drag.  No bubble head anymore!!
B00K6Q2JTI|4|Fit well in my 2014 Wrangler.  The lights are white but not too bright.
B00ZR7WLEE|5|Everything came OK, no install problems.
B00K86J782|5|SOOOOO easy to put on!
B000GV08BE|5|very good spring but I thought it would come in blue.
B006JDDWAM|5|[[ASIN:B006JDDWAM 1998-2003 Toyota Corolla, Chevy/Chevrolet Prizm Gray Grey Front OR Rear Inside Inner Interior Door Handle Left Driver Side (1998 98 1999 99 2000 00 2001 01 2002 02 2003 03)]]
B00V2XHMBY|4|I installed this on a Polaris RZR 800 S. The wiring harness is decent, but the switch it comes with has two lights on it, a red and a green. The red light is on when the light is OFF and the green light is on when the light bar is ON. The constant on of the red light when not in use led to a battery drain, so I cut that switch off and wired a regular toggle switch in. I have only had it installed for a few days, and have not tested it on the trail yet bust so far it's working, it's very bright, and seems well built. Once I have a chance to hit the trails really test it's durability I will edit this post if there is anything needed to make note of.   Update: The relay is junk. After 2 washes it died from water getting in it.
B005345KSA|5|excellent
B000BYD5DO|5|Great item
B000701HF0|5|Works as it should
B00EYTXHDA|5|Great bulbs. Very bright.
B001HXXWGS|4|Wondeful product,used on rv,cleans well, no streaking
B0000AY518|5|Great Wax. Easy to use after pulling the boat out of the water and getting a quick wax done.
B00M1X6F9Y|4|Does what it is supposed to do.  Had a bit of a time putting one side of the pins in, probably paint build up, the other side went smoothly.  This thing works.
B00YI3IGA6|3|These might be great, but they won't work on my car.
B00N12RUFM|2|Had to use glue they don't really stick
B004YWPKS2|1|Product did not fit my car as stated in description on Amazon site. 😡. Had to return item.
B007VR84T4|5|Excellent product, very well packaged, perfect fit.. Very happy with my purchase
B00KFWZS9Q|5|PERFECT 😀
B004XDTDRQ|5|love it
B00663WUYO|5|These are extremely comfortable! I tend to ride pretty hard, which means my falls and encounters with obsticles are equally has hard. The knuckle protection is great. I don't know about longevity yet, but they are really well made.
B0042I4W9G|5|Looks great in my new Yukon
B002MQCYO0|4|Was looking for a safe product to use on plexiglass that makes it shine and help bugs from sticking when they get smashed into. This does a very good job. Windows look GREAT and clean up easy after you apply this stuff. I will say you must clean your surfaces before applying this. The cleaner the better. I would have gave it five stars but it smells bad. I use disposable rubber gloves now. It pricey but it doesn't take much to do the job. I like the results and people notice the shine on my windshield and side windows.
B005EJGSQ2|4|lasted one year
B00WVHDFMU|5|it's actually very good at restoring leather products.
B00LO0M918|5|We bought for use in our new travel trailer and they work great. Very similar to other reviews here.  They give off a bit of a blueish color but I think it's more of a clean looking light than the yellow light of the traditional bulbs.  All bulbs arrived packaged very well and all of them worked.  We used two packs and will be ordering another to complete all of the fixtures.  I highly recommend.
B001B592NY|5|Typical Exedy quality at a great price
B00FP0LHA2|1|I plugged this in and my iPhone 5 said it was not a compatible accessory. The charge given by this charger did not last more than a few hours. I ended up going to Apple and buying a legitimate one and it solved the problem.
B00UM9X1EQ|5|I WAS NICE THANK
B004AYA2PA|5|As expected
B000AM8BLI|3|3 stars because 1 bulb was broken on arrival. My dumbazz fault.Who orders light bulbs through the mail??Drrrrrrr....<br />The other works as should .
B003ZJ16K6|1|The back window visors fit perfectly. The front visors did not. Returned the package for full refund
B00480J4KA|4|Great replacement lamps and a good price
B00BITLGRI|3|Fit like a glove.  The only downside is it's a little slow at the top going up.
B00FJW61AW|5|Best of all made in USA. Great Quality
B00029X2N6|5|Very nice
B005EMPNG0|5|Excellent fit and price
B00KSDSYAW|1|I like the concept, but this product is horrible. There is a stain on the fabric, lint everywhere... Even after washing and drying. Lint, lint, lint,...
B00QSLWAXU|5|Perfect
B0016I7VZC|5|Good product and arrived before date posted !
B004ZG8DAY|5|Great boot. Suprisingly comfortable to walk in.haven't had to use safety features yet thank the motorcycle gods but they should do the job. Next time I will try the Shorty. For the price you can't miss.
B00UVXDIS2|5|CUTE !!
B00M9NGPU0|5|Quality product.<br />Highly recommended.
B00MJ3ZYCU|2|These do NOT fit a 1999 F-350 SD Crew, the angle on the front windows is different
B0002NIKLQ|5|Looks great on the truck! Great product.
B00X9HNIJQ|1|ordered size 00, received size 000, can't use but not worth returning.
B00DR150OA|1|OH yes I fell for this top only to find out the windows and warrenty is void.<br />I call them up and tell them my window turned cloudy in a matter of a couple of months and that I would like to purchase a new back window because no other top is compatable do to it being a replacement top ,that I have to buy the complete top! Customer service sounded like he was stoned! Anyway dont buy this peice of crap!<br />Buy quality if you want it to last!<br />Sorry Sierra,  I wont be calling back!!!!!!!<br />  Dan
B001ELZIAG|5|Good product
B003V57NUQ|4|I could happily give this five stars, but there are two minor issues that explain why this is so cheap. First, some of you may find the assembly kind of daunting. There are 64 pieces altogether and, while ultimately you want a tight fit, the fit is so tight that people not used to assembling, say, a swing set, may find this involves more work than you're used to doing.<br /><br />The second reason this item is so inexpensive is that it isn't adjustable for height or angle. For me, that wasn't a problem. The height and angle turned out to work great for my use.<br /><br />If you're willing to do that extra assembly work and don't need adjustability, then this item does the job of versions costing three or four times as much.
B009S9RURU|5|For some reason my first order got lost in the mail.  I contacted the owner and they sent out another one, no problem.<br />I love this sticker, it's for the parent that wants a little something different then the usual baby on board.
B00C42M4VA|5|as described
B00ONDM07G|5|This should be a stock item with the wrangler. It's awesome. I highly recommend it.
B00CCIM1YQ|4|It is heavy but well worth it.
B007EA6P9O|1|this a defective design and i purchased the hook the same brand thinking the bike rack designed for it but it is not safe at all my bike fell in the middle of strret and when it was on keep moving to the right and left it is not solid and makes a lot of noises it is not worth the moneyi called factory and offered no solution<br />stay away
B000CMHVBC|2|Thin and fragile.
B006QH56GE|5|great product and price! I bought it for my 2011 Volkswagen Jetta and it fits perfect!
B00OO2H3BO|5|Thank you!!! Such a great, durable product!
B005VO4UD8|4|Exactly what I needed and delivered early!!
B00KFWHXLC|5|Completely satisfied
B00KXBOKXO|5|This is a HANDY tool that helps to save time and temper --  Fits easily on hard-to-reach fittings, and allows plenty of flexibility to get to the most difficult of those &#34;buried&#34; Zerk fittings.<br /> Fits all standard grease guns, with adjustable end to fit all Zerk-type grease fittings. .<br />Works great with manual or air-powered grease guns.
B00062YWBU|4|Easy to wire up, comes with quite a few adapters, screwed directly into the test port on my 700R4.
B00B2AU7QE|4|nice and easy to set up, better than putting a line between some trees
B001L9KI56|5|My bike has no cruise control and this was such a quick and cheap fix. I just got back from Sturgis and I cannot express how satisfied I am with it.  It made all the difference when cruising on the highway and for once I could relax my hand and stretch out my fingers while still accelerating. Someday I will have cruise control on my bike, but for now, I highly recommend this gadget!
B00GJ1HUB6|5|I bought this replacement after mine completely stopped working for my 2008 Tahoe LTZ. Exact factory fit and install took me maybe 30min max without lifting the car. If your really wanting to make it easier on yourself removing the tire would give you some more room.
B000CDADFM|5|Been using for several years.  They clear the windshield very well and last a long time.
B000JFJM14|5|Did the job that I needed it to do. Can't ask for more than that.
B00QDH1ROW|5|Awesome.
B00P8ALB7I|5|My father in law needed his antenna replace and we did it works lol
B000S2UGXQ|4|Was delivered  on time works  fine
B00JHEG810|5|Very good. Great quality. Fast shipping
B00EQ2ZFQW|5|Look good. No damage when delivered.
B00G620ZVU|5|Great lights for the price...very bright for their size and extremely &#34;aimable&#34;!
B005JVNOH6|5|It's a STACK! What more can I say! Controls my rad fans great, lights up great, and works like all the other stack gauges I have owned!
B004FZ7TQ4|5|Very good quality. YNWA
B002WGKP32|5|love them, were them on my rocket every day, breath well and are comfortable, fast shipping, thanks.
B00ZEJGDT4|5|This is a nice part.  It fit on my 2015 Ram 2500 perfectly!  Vast improvement over the plastic plug that comes with the truck.  This should have come on the truck to begin with!
B013U1KYPG|4|my grill insert just arrived today. The first thing I noticed was the great quality. It seems very well made. the second thing I noticed is it did not come with instructions or mounting hardware. after i install my hood lock ( has not arrived yet ) and will tackle the grill insert. Im hoping the installation is self explanatory.
B00KWLL8K8|4|Wish it was a 9/16 setup.
B00K6OXSG8|5|So far these are awesome. They fit the car perfectly, and being the penultimate clutz I drop stuff a lot. I have no worries my car's floor will be kept clean with these guys.
B00LOX4SNM|5|I'm so happy this is on my car!
B00757KJTI|1|Horrible reception. Sent it back.
B000C14U12|3|I ordered this item for a 1997 Acura CL. It does not fit. The mounting bolts do not line up with the mounting holes in the door frame. Also the electric connector is a 2 prong. I needed a 4-wire connector. Although the Amazon check indicated this item to be the correct one for my car, it is not. The correct item for my car is 741-715
B00CAX5WR6|4|Pricey for a little bracket and 4 zip ties.
B00355OW2O|5|really does keep it clean in there
B00KMPNUJQ|5|Havent used it yet but can tell it is of good quality.
B00BEKV34M|2|I installed the Kuyakyn Tank Bag on my 2007 Harley Softail Custom for a 38 day, 10,923 mile ride to Alaska and back.  The Zippers seem to be installed upside down because when you unzip either the top or bottom zipper, the contents in the bag slide out. The bag comes with a soft cloth to help prevent the bag from scratching the gas tank. After two long stretches of road construction on the Alaska Highway the tank still got scratched.  It I had washed the cloth every night it may have helped.  The bag was too small for my 12&#34; MacBook.  The magnets hold the bag fairly tight.
B000C9WL4W|5|Wix is always my first choice
B00G186POK|5|Way brighter than the OEM lights. Work great!
B001GH1LMM|5|These spacers worked great on my 2011 dodge, very easy to install.
B00DKAMH7G|5|great
B00TEA0WXC|5|Easy to install and even easier to use. Love the fact that I can now disconnect my sway bar when I want. Thanks EVO!
B00063X7KG|4|Yup, does what it's supposed to do!  Car's paint was a lot smoother after hitting it with a clay bar.
B009WEV5AO|5|great product and just what I needed
B00DGVRXD2|5|Good product
B00H63NWYA|4|It's a pretty good bulbs for the price.  Cannot comment on longevity yet.  However if you are using it for DRL application you will be disappointed because there is no change in color.  Only when used at high wattage (such as highbeams) do they look whiter.
B00HDUKOBU|5|Excellent product.  Easy installation.  One of the very few headlight modulators that work (legally) with LED headlights.
B0072PALLO|5|Perfecta
B00APM0AKS|5|Black caps have worked through several bike rides so far this summer. Lost my other black caps. I love that there are several in the package in case they get lost again.
B006UH508Y|5|received exactly as expected.
B001Y8QYR0|2|Did not like it, it was too small for the Barbie's.........
B0045DGUW0|5|My husband was able to place it onto my 2012 MKX. I am very pleased. He didn't have any issues. This product will help when my Lab jumps in and his  paws sometimes hits the bumper. I love the logo letters. I thought it was a good fit and I didn't see the need for it too be longer.  If  It needs to be replaced in a few years I will purchase the same kind.  I love the black on my white MKX.
B001810SHA|1|BEWARE!!!!<br /><br />This seller does NOT accept returns of crappy item nor will they let you stop shipment once you have placed the order. This stuff is JUNK! Do NOT waste your money on this crap.
B009FUF6DM|5|Really nice towels for the price.
B0002NIJ8A|5|good
B005Q7M3SY|5|Fit like they are supposed to.
B007TY1F1I|3|Ended up having to take the motor off of this unit and out it on my old one. The new unit was bent and would not roll all the way up. If I had not already had the window out I would have sent it back. But I was in a pinch to get the job done.  Three stars since I also bought a unit for the rear door and it worked perfectly.
B00B2N2Z3O|5|OEM.. looks awesome. I love em
B001QFF1M0|4|Perform as advertised. Only issue was that they were larger in diameter then the original equipment they replaced so was a somewhat tighter fit.
B00E5HV1PW|5|Looked GREAT on my 2004 GSXR!  Love it, couldn't ask for anything better.  Little bigger than my black visor, but looks wonderful on the bike, nice sleek appearance. Fit PERFECT
B0002UEOLO|5|Wouldn't change plugs without this stuff.
B00ZB5JAC8|5|It is amazing that I could get this one!
B0002JMPRK|5|Great adhesive to install sound deadening mat when installing a sound system.
B002LRWDKK|2|This mirror on the attached bracket does not have enough range of motion either up and down or side to side. I should have bought the other model.
B00IRWFQUW|5|Came a lot quicker then expected. Me and my bf love it and would definitely do business again. Thank you
B000BYD78W|5|Delivered on time. Noticed better performance over traditional spark plugs. Not a whole lot, but noticeable.
B006ID37ZS|4|Good deal
B00ERXG6MW|5|This safety belt provides a secure handhold for my motorcycle passengers. I recommend it highly!
B002PYBZJO|5|Delivered seems like the next day. Works on every vehicle I've tried. Software is free, but offers an upgrade for 39.99 or something like that. Works with other software. Let's you download OBDwiz software which detected no codes, so I downloaded ScanXL software (which it does not come with) off of the internet and it detected my alternator was going bad. I use both software's for different features. The scan-tool/cable is great hasn't failed me yet. Make sure to try a few different software's though. Also gives mode 06 HEX codes for better troubleshooting if you are familiar with $06 (MODE 6). And if you really know what your doing you can customize\hack your PCM\ECM to do some pretty cool custom s*** with special software and intricate knowledge of course.
B001P2EZEO|5|Looks great.  Less them a minute to install.  Truck looks so much better.
B0007V9XAU|2|Missed dimensions. Like other reviewers, I had to grind down the oblong hole openings on the mounting flange to make the bolts fit. I also had to grind a flat on each of the washers so that they would clear the inside radius of the flange plates and fit flatter against the nuts. Plan on at least an hour for the modifications if you have a die grinder and longer if you have to use a file. If the main square tube was about 3/8&#34; longer, this would be a non issue as there still would have been room for the hitch to fit without interference. The packaging was also insufficient as a fair amount of metal on the back side of the receiver tube was worn down because the cardboard box was ill designed for the weight of the receiver in the center of the box and the box was apparently dragged or pushed on concrete before or during shipping. There was no protection in the receiver area of the shipping box. I had to re-paint this area to prevent future rust.
B000C2QPEG|5|fit perfectly, AC was ice cold immediately with the drier replacement great product, 4 seasons has been around a long time and has been very reliable in my experience
B00CHQ0F1E|1|This is a (WAY OVERPRICED) way to make a connection . If you plan to be hooking up a temporary electrical connection I guess it serves as a reusable crimp. does not make a good permanent solution though. And its made very cheaply VERY small and threads will strip easily if you try to tighten to much. Also the end caps you screw on to tighten the wires down are EXTREMELY small and easy to lose. And if you lose one of the caps the connector becomes USELESS and for a buck or more a piece that can become a real expensive problem....SAVE  your money these are way too expensive and M/O a bad choice for an electrical connection.
B00XULVDHK|5|Thanks so much! The shades are perfect....exactly what we wanted. They are easy to use and work great! Thanks so much! :)
B00CZG6WO0|4|I used these to replace old 12 v lights in a trailer that was built in 1970s, it uses less energy and give me more light, so it doesn't drain the battery as fast.
B000BPSW7C|5|I wax my cars twice a year and try to use little soap when I wash them.  After 6 months the water still beads up a bit indicating that there is still some wax.  FYI, I live in the Missouri so the cars do see some exposure to salt and snow but not like up north.
B00I82CIAM|5|Awesome choice
B000C55LPW|5|Good shocks at a good price. Can definitely tell a difference. I recommend using an impact wrench if you are going to replace your shocks. I used the 18V Dewalt 3/8 and some penetrating oil and they came off easy.
B009F10S3Y|3|Came undone after a few hours but managed to get 3M double sided TAPE and well what can i say hasn't failed yet
B00OL0GM48|4|Quick delivery with Amazon Prime, price was ok. They work for what I needed them for, in the engine compartment for some broken stock ones I had on the radiator plastic cover.
B00QWBYOPS|5|very good product
B00N0N75W0|5|Purchased this fan to install in my 2006 Dodge 3500 Cummins and works great.  Its a puller style fan instead of a pusher, so it is more efficient.  It also uses a bar and stack radiator vs the standard fin radiator.  I installed this to the frame rail under the bed; nice and compact fan.  It comes with 2 wired connectors, 1 for each fan, that I had to cut off and wire up.  I wired a switch for the fan and didn't use a thermostat; I monitor the tranny temps via a gauge so I just turn it on when needed.  It helps me maintain temperatures when towing and while city driving.  Great product, thanks Derale!
B000RW1XCK|3|The adhesive came fast and was good the tube pictured is not the one it came in but my calk gun worked fine with it
B007AOQW24|4|More curved around the edges than I would have thought . Overall I love the protection :)
B005G5S1CS|5|Excellent!  We got these for my son and he loves them. He doesn't get too excited about anything but he did with these boots!  He put them on right away, and then 1 minute later tested them on his dirt bike. He said they were awesome and sturdy. The toe area is wide-ish so your toes won't get blistered up or crunched up....according to him.
B00Y5EZENK|5|Look awsome on my wifes car
B000E4GER0|4|what my car needed
B000NCOKZQ|3|I use this between my battery and solar charge controller to keep it separately fused.  Works great for that purpose.  My only gripe is that I had to clip the ring terminals to fit them on the battery posts.
B0048J4Q6I|5|Worked to fix an old problem with my drivers side window. A pain to install but well worth the money. This motor came​ with all the things you need to do the install: screws, captured nuts, and pop rivets. Great buy.
B00BFUFT2S|5|Water base and goes on nicely I love it!!
B000XA5NEU|5|Works Well
B000QCHRVM|5|Fast delivery...good product.....we must all learn to laugh more :)
B0046YMYCS|4|Perfect length for the license place logo slot, very good additional brake light and not to mention very cool looking...
B003AYUB84|3|The zipper portion could be just a little longer zipper. will barely fit credit card thru it. also the credit card and ID pockets need to be deeper. They stick out to far to close wallet.
B00PV5CINQ|5|Quality is extremely good. Love them !!!!
B00N5UBQHS|4|Worked as expected. I liked the battery charger, it lets you know the progress of charging. Nice and light. H
B00HJWSMRU|4|Nice size easy install
B000B8N3GE|5|Very nice fit, good and tight.
B0007Y4P9G|5|Perfect for what we needed it for.
B0021YZER2|5|LOVE THIS FOR GLASS
B0000AXYA0|5|It does go on heavy and smell like coconut.
B00CZG8YR8|5|These should take a lot of load off my batteries.
B00EPDLQTM|5|Easy to attach and holds well
B00TDFZEU4|2|Wasn't the correct size when i got it so i had to bore out the cylinder, works fine though
B00391FOSK|5|Bought this part after estimate from dealer over two hundred dollars installed ourselves cost 36.00 very satisfied
B00FPCW9HA|5|Good fit, good leather
B000P6WQB0|5|Is this made up of powdered unicorns blessed by a demon found at a crossroads on the first Halloween? With a deal this sweet I am just happy my bargain hunter wife hasn't seen it or I would have a garage full of this while she is trying to shake people down on Ebay for retail price.
B00KWNUME4|5|Just what I was looking for in this price range, surpassed my expectations.
B0087NAWYQ|5|i just received this i cant wait to set it up i am so pumped no complains yet.
B00HFX1Z8G|5|These were a shot in the dark for me in terms of brand but the price was right and the reviews were solid so I bought. Sears had no trouble programming them so I'm fully satisfied for now. Time will be the ultimate test though. Fingers crossed!
B00JW1W4ZC|5|Just like OEM. Good replacement.
B00QGNSD6S|5|They fit on easily and work well.  Not oversized so they get in the way and not so thin that they don't add any padding.  Just right.
B003177CR8|5|Great product
B00FLB6P02|5|perfect fit!!!
B000PTKONY|5|Worked really well! Used dishsoap to set the bead and had the tires changed faster than a automatic machine!
B00QLDDC50|5|gave it five stars. looks great on white truck!
B008P19B3S|2|Dosnt fit very well but for the price works fine ....lowered cars will scrap all over the place ...mine is only lowered 3/4 inch and it scrapes everywhere .....again not bad for the price just keep in mind when perchasing this exhaust
B00EM8ISUA|5|Fit excellent.
B000QQWAYC|5|2009 Chrysler Sebring Touring Convertible and it was a perfect fit. Easy to install. Highly recommend. No more annoying knocking sound when driving over bumps!!
B000CIY0U6|5|Works and fits great.
B00540KPS8|5|Exactly what I wanted and was exactly as it was stated
B00TDOGY04|4|Good for the price.  But don't smell much like I thought.  But this is the one product that is very subjective.  To one person it may not smell good but to another it might smell great.<br />Here are my thoughts<br />-Smell does last awhile once you've done multiple applications.<br />-Small amount goes a long ways.  Multiple small amounts throughout a few weeks to get it into the fabric and it will last.<br />-NEW CAR<br />  -Doesn't smell like any new car I have been in.<br />  -Unique, crisp smell.<br />  -In my opinion, it's ok but I will not buy again<br />-LEATHER<br />  -Doesn't smell like leather to me<br />  -Hard to explain smell.  Not bad,not good in my opinion.<br /><br />For the price and size,  it is worth getting.  Not my favorite fresheners but still good enough to finish the bottles.<br /><br />New car smell doesn't smell like any new car I've ever sat in.
B002ZRQ48S|5|Perfect replacement for my 2009 Porsche 911S.
B00AECG828|2|It fit the bed of our ford ranger nicely but the hooks were not sturdy at all. We got them hooked then gave a light tug to make sure they would hold and several of the hooks came flying off. Very disappointing. I'm returning this.
B01191O630|5|exactly as advertised
B004ST9LKY|5|Works perfectly as advertised.
B0094DEG7M|1|The pink changed to clear white the second day i had them on
B00094I1SA|5|Works great
B00BAI09N4|5|The Rotopax Containers are pretty slick.  I do a lot of off grid camping and off roading, and the Rotopax containers work well for my purposes.  I might even buy a second one!
B00KTHUMHK|2|Obviously very difficult to program, have tried acouple times and haven't got it yet
B007R690JC|5|They were perfect!  Fit well and work great.
B001EOV45G|5|Works great!
B0072MIQN2|5|Did the trick, had hose blow out on Bricklin SV-1 Hydraulic Pump. Drop in Fit, not the exact same lengths as I removed but more than enough room.
B000C6ESLO|5|A+++
B00IMVEHEO|2|The double back tape will not stick not good!!!!
B003MHZSEQ|5|Exact replacement that was easy to install.
B00EKEGRVS|3|I have only had it a week, so far so good
B00029J3W0|5|Works perfectly on my 2011 JKU. I bought this after having overheating problems when I rock crawled at low speeds for extended periods of time. I haven't had any issues since!
B00F3SZQRQ|5|So far so good.
B008OAECW0|5|This product worked out very well.
B00HESFIJ4|3|It's not as accurate as previous models. I ended up buying  a digital gauge for those tires which need more precise measurment.
B004A32D1M|5|Perfect fit
B000C936YG|5|Installed on a 1998 Jeep TJ and the sound is perfect compared to the loud Thrush that was already on there. This is not loud in the cab, but still sounds good on the outside.
B000J41YO8|4|Fits like a glove around the windshield of my Toyota Tundra.  However, as you can imagine, after a few weeks baking in the sun of Houston, Texas, the aluminum face has started to separate from the foam backing.  This &#34;bubbling&#34; makes it look cheap.  The resulting distortion also negatively impacts the tight fit around the window frame.  Still, this is the best sunshade that I've found so far.  I would buy it again if I needed to but I'm looking for something that will look better after a few weeks in the sun.  Also, would love to see a product like this made for the side windows as well.
B0000AXF21|5|Good value.
B00JJR5AJG|5|Loved it!!
B00K53F8SQ|5|Bought it as a spare : Haven't used it yet but just like the original in looks and size
B003RVSQOQ|1|Does not work for my 2010 Nissan Versa.
B002X6VXL4|4|It worked worked as indicated.
B005O6HVHU|5|As advertised. Good product
B00FCE49FQ|3|Shipped quick, worked well.
B002801Z7W|4|a good product for a good price.  Easy to install
B00J43ULT4|5|Amazing helmet, nice weight and fit
B005ETJVOS|5|Fuel pump works great
B007PPG0Q6|5|Ordered this balast cause I originally started with one light to keep from spending all the money, well, after a few weeks I said heck yeah and completed the whole set. Balast works great.<br /><br />Joshua Morris<br />2007 Toyota FJ Cruiser.
B003CEJXGI|5|Fit easily and true to size advertised. Can't  beat  the  price
B001DEPOLC|5|A++++
B00NW860M4|5|Very happy with it.
B000JFHNG0|4|Does the job. Gauges are on the cheaper side.
B007N3P9DA|5|It was cheap and easy to install.  Now my little Wrangler can go anywhere, despite the small tires.  Now my only limit is ground clearance.  Better bang for the buck than bigger tires.  Buy this first.
B000EDOSSI|5|These worked great! They were light but strong.
B00UCTY6UY|5|EXTREMELY HEAVY BOX. THESE MATS HAVE A THICK WATERPROOF LAYER, CAN BE REUSED MANY TIMES.
B001RP2TPQ|5|I've had this for about a month now and I like it.  It looks pretty nice and is just like the description.  Some people said it's flimsy but it seems reasonablely sturdy.  Only one small thing to note, it doesn't come with any screws so I had to buy some.
B006CRT72W|5|Great price. Quick shipping!
B00G6IO4Z2|2|More like spray paint, not a dye.
B004QHS154|5|EXCELENTE
B003EP52BU|5|Really useful. Must for cars
B00KCQSOAA|5|Exactly what expected! Very satisfied.
B010ILSIDQ|5|Just what I wanted.
B003RAAZT6|2|you have to be with in 5 feet from your vehicle for it to work. No range at all.
B009FIC5CY|5|These were beefy and darling all at once!!!!
B00HQQXOPO|3|Lighted easy to install very bright good value
B00062YSJQ|5|Good stuff
B00KOEB9CK|5|1 gallon is a lot of granite wax, but having used this product and knowing how good it is, we plan to share it with our daughter.  i
B00X60BNCK|1|No the decal was terrible and the graphics was to i would not recommend this to anyone
B001Q4VILY|1|It's not 2&#34;, it's 1-1/4&#34; receiver (female).
B00FQ0ROZS|5|DO NOT look into light when trying them out the are Bright I only got 1 set but i do not need my brights anymore.
B00XX0YS6Q|4|I needed to get an adapter to properly make this fit my 1990 4runner. It works great. It can fit without the adapter but it does not fold properly.
B00CAJ6O4A|1|I realize you get what you pay for, and the item itself wasn't very expensive. I'm more so writing this to give people a heads up rather than complain. So the product itself lasted about 2 months. Started getting chips in the base within the first few weeks didn't mind that so much, cause as I said you get what you pay for. What did really suck was that the product literally melted and warped into some wonky shape. I took it off and it now resides on the floor in my garage.<br /><br />So if you live in a place that reaches 100 degrees wouldn't recommend this as it will melt.
B00YW8KULU|5|Work out wonderfully I love my seat covers they match the color to my truck :) I'm very pleased with them.
B009Z3SQ90|5|This is excellent! I love it and ordered 6 cans and when this is used up, I will order again!!
B000EQ2K1W|5|Fit and worked perfectly
B000JL95TC|1|Ridiculously terrible product.  Unless you own a welding torch, forget wasting your time trying to light these fat sticks. Even worse than the product is the return policy which I failed to access.  At the time I placed my order, I ordered an entirely different brand of sticks and happened to open that particular product first to use and I'm still using and enjoying those.  I opened the Coghlan's just last week and found it impossible to light one and maintain the light.  It took forever to even appear lit, and then when turned upright, it wasn't lit at ALL.  Now it is 30 days past the refund date, and I am getting only a partial refund on the 6 of 7 boxes I need to return.  LESSON learned Amazon and other sellers.  I WILL check return policy from this day forward.  My mistake.  But, Amazon, you need to quit selling these via whoever the seller was/is.  Guess I will save the opened package for cold weather and go ahead and apply that welding torch and try to use the remaining 4 sticks.  Hopefully the torch will work!!  People don't waste your time on these!!
B00B3XUAQ2|5|Works Great
B00XKY89AG|5|Product came very quickly and was exactly what I was expecting.
B008B5XAQ2|5|Exact replacement for my Ford Focus Electric emergency tire repair pump. My local Ford parts department didn't even know what I was talking about at first then tried to sell me an entire pump. It is extremely easy to replace.
B00BQHABMS|3|work fine
B001GX9U3S|4|Worked great, only toke about 15 mins to begin to wrinkle but I'm only giving it 4 stars because it's more orange-red... Not the red I wanted but it'll do, easy to use just make sure you put on an even coats! 3 coats and 10-15 min wait between all of them!<br />None of the pictures have filters, just make sure you know that you want a lighter red (Orangish) color and not well blood red (or darker red). Great company though!
B00F3H5YA6|5|A+
B001A0N83K|5|Nice product especially for the money, looks and feels like quality .
B0002STSC6|4|Just the right tool to test my car and solve the problem.
B00MWH72IW|5|meets all my expectations
B00NBV56HW|5|Good Product.  Highly recommended.
B00JQYNTT0|4|Works great as expected
B00H1I639Q|5|great NUTS.... much better than OEM ... solid heavy and USA made..
B00HRK1PH8|5|Bumper fits good, ups damaged it, but a little fiberglass took care of it.
B005BNYV2Y|5|My daughter used this on the ramps for her Ferrett cage as they were steep and he would slide down. Great grip and easy to install!
B0041PUBVI|5|Comfortable and good feel
B008BVVY6O|2|Bought this item for a birthday gift to my husband. He had to cut holes in fabric (as the instructions stated) to insert the head rest. The fabric for the head rest was too big and he was missing a cover for the middle row.
B0040CRREG|5|Very God
B002HVJ8WQ|5|Great product easy to install ,came with complete instructions, took 10 minutes to replace both mirrors...
B000VKRQ7O|5|was just as expected, fast shipping and good price
B007Y4W98Q|5|I was worried if this would actually be a custom fir to my windshield, because all the sunshades at the store did not fit right, leaving large portions of my dash exposed which will cause it to crack, especially in the Florida sun where I live. This sunshade ended up being a perfect fit and I am pleased with my purchase and would recommend this product. It is pricey compared to generic sunshades, but you get what you pay for!
B00916MMJG|5|works great
B008BC8EW0|5|The mirrors came super quick, they look really good on my 2000 chevy silverado 1500.  The mirrors only took about five minutes to install, look amazing, will be an upgrade that will give the truck a more of a tough/bad boy truck.  The seller has great customer service, I had to reach out to them on a few emails, they were friendly and very helpful.  Will use this seller again and would highly recommend to others. Great product at a great prices. thanks td
B00F6XA0KG|4|Good product for money thickness is great will last forever.
B00BQVF8J0|5|Good product and works nicely.
B007P4O4F6|5|Amazing,Swell,OK!
B0050EITTK|4|Easy hook up and will be great for our unit. It is not too heavy that we can't disconnect and haul with us and hook up at the next stop. Price is good, have not had to regenerate yet. We have a carbon filter on before the inlet to extend life. Should have got it a long time ago.
B000JFNAAS|4|Gets the job done, mine arrived without thread cover/nipple
B003YM8YMM|5|NICE!!! Well made and I had no problem attaching Velcro straps around the padded roll bar in my 08 Wrangler X.  I bought this figuring to use it for my shooting glasses which also has 3 extra pairs of lenses, however it did not work well for intended purpose as the flap came up a bit short of Velcro which holds the flap in place.  Regardless, I still like it and left it  attached to roll bar as the extra storage is nice and I did put my extra lenses in one of the compartments so it was not a total loss and I'm sure to find a use for other compartment as well.  My shooting glasses are a bit larger (bulkier) than regular prescription glasses and many brands of sun glasses, I'm sure it would work well for those.  At any rate, I am still pleased with purchase as it was well worth the price and the extra storage no matter how small is always nice!
B005N53AM2|5|Living in Arizona, we need steering wheel covers! This is one beautiful, easy to put on and never gets too hot to touch...even in 120 degree weather
B00LNOTM0G|5|Plug and play and definitely &#34;white&#34; light to match my crees.  Very nice.
B00X6D4G4E|4|I like the fact that I don't have to buy the whole unit. I just wish they made them of metal so I won't have to keep buying them. I've bought 2 and they work great.
B000BO8Z9I|5|Good stuff
B00NWUEFW4|5|Cool little decal. Arrived ahead of schedule and was of good quality. I even went and liked them on Facebook. Now hopefully this decal doesn't fall off after the first winter in upstate NY.
B00062YZWQ|5|Good
B001P2HWC6|5|Well worth the money. I have loaded this twice to capacity with out incident.
B00433SIQI|5|Good. Handy kit.
B00652YCWO|5|It smells great!
B004SSB5CW|5|Awesome. My fiance loved it.
B001PYL1VM|4|Haven't had a chance to test it in the lab yet, but build quality feels good.
B00029JC5S|3|These last about a year. Bought a Summit Racing replica and it has lasted over twice as long so far.
B006GJO4HE|5|Worked great - much better than plastic line
B000OV3NDQ|4|I really do like this seat, but like others have mentioned the seat cover rips too easily. It does sit you a bit forward, which is what you want in a creeper seat. This is not a chair to lounge in, its a seat to get work done without having to be on your knees or hunched over standing or squatting.<br /><br />I haven't figured out how to mend the seat as it tore where the vertical back meets the horizontal seat. Probably Gorilla tape will work just find and hold for a long while.
B0002NIKJ8|5|Very good for all season
B0009VIQ1A|3|works to remove the dust but leaves a film on the paint. Stretches out car washes
B005J92VHW|5|They are German made. Well made and sure beats the $189 at Nissan or even $99 at autozone.
B003YP57JM|5|Worked great at half the price of local Auto Parts Store.  Cold air blowing in a matter of minutes
B002P8QKAY|4|worked perfectly!
B00AYA3Q0M|5|Perfect fit and looks great
B00JIJ4LWW|1|did not work on stains
B00RHP37SI|5|I have purchased other switches on here and they used too thin of wiring and would melt. This one held up and never had any issues.
B00G4AB4MS|4|This just landed on my doorstep.  Will install on Wednesday.  I have a Curt hitch and that was easy to install and very well made.
B000FRLO9Y|5|So far the charger is working great. I have not attempted to bring a dead battery to life again. Optima suggest this charger, so I'm going to give it a shot. I have noticed it does get a bit warm, compared to my old charger.
B006V3SKZM|5|Easy to apply. Holding up so far
B00YAD6H00|5|Love Yorkim products - worked perfectly - considerably brighter then the stock glove box bulb - very impressed - thank you Yorkim ...
B00SYTB2TM|5|Gotta say this tire shine last a long time. Great product!
B00DHQYZPU|5|Genuine MBZ part in MBZ packaging, for 1/4 of the dealer prices. A steal!
B00NX8EYFI|4|Very cute and easy to apply
B008I7RM7G|1|This mirror does not fit a 2004 toyota sequoia ltd as described.  i am attempting to return it.  Otherwise, it looked nice and arrived timely.
B00N5UBQHS|4|Portable and charges my battery pretty quickly.
B008QR1AXU|5|Great procuct and fast delivery time
B00B51V5CU|5|Excellent
B00SL1XFMK|5|You will not be disappointed! Nice quality and well built value. Easy to use, it will likely last many seasons. I have used for almost two years and still holding up well, and move it around all the time. Built to last. Maintenance is simply checking the screws are tight and secured, recommend replacing screws with nut/bolt/washers and 'locktite' the threads (super easy).  Looking at other competitor's fire pits, this Camco product stands apart from the crowd with the 65,000 BTU output and included 10' hose with regulator. It actually puts out a great flame. Between the ground and the base it stays cool down under the pit. A delicate manicured grass lawn could show some wilting.  In the woods best to still clear any vegetation away down to the mineral soil both under and around the unit.  Make Smokey proud and keep the fire in the pit! I did order some fake logs to lay on top of the lava rocks and dress up the 'fire pit effect'. Purchased the large version and am not concerned about the weight. It will be no real issue to move it from a truck to more remote car-camping sites. Even loaded with lava rocks the weight is similar to a large bag of animal feed.The included cover is useful enough and would be great for patio/back yard users. Travelers, probably best to build a simple wood crate to pack it in well with your other gear. With a proper crate you could remove and store the rocks, and protect the fire pit when traveling any distance to car camp and insure all your other gear will stay clean too. Use the shipping box for your new crate dimensions. Fun in the summer time!
B000NPDL76|4|Easy tool to test if your head gasket is blown.  I had to watch a video on YouTube first to see how to use this thing because the instructions were a little confusing.  Also, not sure how bad it is if the blue stuff got into the radiator but it did so, I just drained the whole radiator.
B00O2HYIJG|5|Works Good on my AR15 Rifle. Looks Good and Sounds Even Better Helps with Recoil Too. Would recommend if some curios about buying it. Easy to put on too.
B00CA3QFNQ|4|Very happy with grill gaurd
B007489RNC|5|excelent
B00435H0GA|3|Whar is up with the cancerous materials sticker?
B00LWOHFB0|5|&#34;EXCELLENT LOOKING HAT&#34;...VERY EYE CATCHING AND THE COLORS POP!!!!<br /><br />GREAT PRICE FOR THIS LOGO CORVETTE DETAIL!!!!
B003UT3S6Q|3|Wasn't aware of two different strengths thought they were both the same product
B0051D3MP6|4|I had one of these fail on me after about a year of operation, but the other two I purchased are going strong.  Would be 5 Stars if not for the intermittent quality.  These are a great buy and I love all the accessories that come with it.  Small size and easy operation.
B0050NOJYU|4|Great product looks nice and simple to install.  Would be a 5 star but the first one had to be sent back because it was damaged and was clearly a return packaged in 2 boxes taped together.  Amazon replace very quickly and a brand new one was received.
B002LNVBT8|3|Priced decent, good gloves.
B005GOPT0G|4|we purchased 14 of them to replace all the spaceports in our RV. they fit prefect in our class A. Only 1 problem one of the ports was broken when we opened the box. but was an easy fix, used one of our old ports to fix it. did not contact seller cuz we were able to fix it our self.
B003NBFKDK|4|Bought this in conjunction with Highland 1041700 rainproof cargo bag.  The two worked together perfectly the only issue I had with this cargo carrier is that the receiver lock was too big (diameter)  for the hitch on my 2010 Honda Pilot.  I ended up buying  the Trimax T-3BLACK Premium 5/8&#34; Key Receiver Lock.
B002GJQ1ZG|5|These are patches designed for use in tire inner tubes.  They work great for that, when using the included glue.  I see that lots of Amazon reviewers have creative uses for the patches, but I can't speak to how well they work for anything but tire tubes.  If you use them for tire tubes, you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />If you're a serious motorcyclist or bicycle rider you should carry some of these patches.  A road side patch could save you a long walk or an expensive tow bill.<br /><br />I have performed several road side tube repairs with these patches on motorcycle tubes, and they have gotten me home every time.  Personally, I replace a tube after I patch it as soon as possible, just to be safe.<br /><br />I patched a friend's tube, on a 500cc dual sport bike, with one of these patches about a year ago.  He has put about 2,000 miles on it since an it holds air just fine.
B005HZ4HBG|5|Fit perfect and keep the kids crumbs off of the carpet! Easy to clean.
B00JF5HR7K|5|Works well, just be careful of how low your receiver is installed. I had to get a lift kit to raise the carrier higher when I have it loaded down so it doesn't bottom out on the pavement.
B00BHGXYRC|5|Quality Item! I would suggest to everyone to purchase. Item came when expected, and packaging was good.
B0007M1FMI|4|Does the job and appears to be well made. Wrapped with a little electrical tape to tighten up the fit in my truck's receiver.
B004W9FAU0|4|Works great, instructions do have a couple of unclear spots:<br /><br />- first with how you install the new horn pad harness - the directions tell you to install the back cover first and then the pads, really should do it the other way around as the cover locks them in. BTW I found a 90 degree hook to work a lot better for removing the air bag than the screwdriver method recommended.<br /><br />- second, and MOST IMPORTANT - before you try to pull the new harness through the firewall, check the passenger side strut tower. In my 2007 the connector for the servo was already zip tied to the strut tower and everything (except the horn pads above) was pre-wired. This allows you to skip trying to pull about 5 new wires through an existing harness port. Guess I should have taken a photo but if you're mechanically inclined enough to do the rest of the job you'll figure it out.<br /><br />Once in it works GREAT - holds speed just about perfectly (mine does have manual transmission which helps)
B00877SL2M|5|on time and work well
B0061RG5KU|5|This shift knob is extremely well built.  Looks custom like it came from the manufacturer.  Even in 115 degree heat in Texas it's still not that hot to handle which is great.
B002OUPFOU|5|Great replacement for the original city water receptacle on my Sea Ray. I was skeptical about the chrome covered plastic, however the product has held its own and it appears to look as good as a stainless steel part. This price was half of what you would pay at a store in the local area. The rubber cap is an especially nice addition for when you are not using any hose.
B00NOG0PNO|4|Nice produc
B00F17Q8BM|5|good
B0044B0YJ8|5|worked
B001V8U12M|5|Talk about making life easier! I was hand-cranking the scissor jacks on my pop-up on a trip last summer and the guy across from us busted out a drill and one of these sockets. He did all of his in less time than it took me to do one! If you're still hand-cranking, get one of these now! Awesome!
B006YBC0GG|4|Fits well.  However, the anchor holes are larger than the anchor studs in the car.  Something this expensive should be precise.
B002TMQ4AM|5|Very happy with the quality.  Compares to Weather Tech.....but less expensive.
B000S6PGX2|5|Very well made and looks great.  Amazed by how much I can actually stuff in it.  Keeps it's shape nicely.
B00BWT353C|2|Another product that works but if you're looking for quality and perfection, then this is not what you need.  Typical LED light that does not totally goes off.  15% bright when the car is off, 100 bright when the car is on.  Installed on my overhead light.  It would have been perfect if it goes totally off when its off. I still haven't install the second set.  price is good, quality is okay, usability is not so bad if you're not annoy of the light never goes dark when its off.
B002MQAWOY|2|Waaaaaay too short. Not as advertised in the picture.
B007LIA8JM|5|Great product
B001O0VNX8|5|Wagner ThermoQuites - good as always!
B000CKN762|5|Great quality, it even looks better than the foreign made knockoffs. Proud to say that it is made in the USA. It doesn't just fit the rear drive shaft, as Amazon describes, it fits all locations, front and rear drive shafts. (On a 1976 Ford F150 4x4). Of course Dana is the maker of the original equipment front axle. So who better to patronize than the original maker, in the USA.
B000CF8W1W|5|Easy install and looks great
B004HE563G|5|These pads work great. My Suburban stops when I need it too, no longer when it wants too. Will never use cheap semi metalic again. You can feel the difference when stopping on demand.<br />I recommend...
B000S2SKIY|5|Fit Perfect!!
B002UZLNBI|5|Opens most electronics, packages, and bottles.<br />Goes just fine through airport security provided you remember to throw your keys in your bag before you hit the line.  The x-ray scanners don’t have the resolution to see that it’s not a regular key.<br />The knife isn't high quality and can't be resharpened, but it was like $6 when I bought it, what do you expect?<br />The bottle opener works great, but you have to be careful, as if you use too much force the knife blade will come down after the cap is off and nick the back of your other hand.
B000C9POFK|5|Took 5 minutes to swap out and fit perfect! The listing says acdelco but what showed up for me was a gates part. It fit regardless, but it would have been nice if I received what I thought I ordered.
B000GZTIA2|5|Awesome product, you will need to drill a hole through your kickstand but it is worth it. I've had 2 Sportsters and got this extension for both of them.
B00904WS84|2|We purchased a large one previously so ordered another one and it was not same size fit.
B006EGAIII|1|Broke on first use
B0001MQ7EK|5|will order again. all perfect
B0000AQQWW|5|Very strong good winch as a replacement for the original winch that came on the trailer .
B005ZHRNOE|5|There really isn't much to say other than it literally fits the window perfectly on my 2012 GTI.  Only &#34;con&#34; is that because it fits so flawlessly you have to move your rear view mirror to get it in place every time.  Not that it's a problem to take 2 whole seconds to re-position your mirror when you take it down.<br /><br />Highly recommend1
B009DJNPOW|5|Very pleased.
B005GLNAFK|5|A++++++
B00RHAPZ2Y|5|Excellent product and arrived in just a week
B00K8E0WAG|5|I use it to power radio and computer equipment (direct-connected or through a pure-sinewave inverter).  I charge it via a charge controller from a solar pannel, or from a 13.8 VDC switching power supply.  Works great!
B00V3XFFE4|3|The product itself is good but the delivery was very slow compared to most things I've ordered in the past.
B0087XOTWW|1|I was leary about replacing all the bulbs in my travel trailer with LED because I am particular about the color of light being produced. Unfortunately my concerns were amplified by these bulbs. In the description they say these bulbs are white, not even close. They are very blue, all of them. I order a total of 18 bulbs and each one is the same color, bright blue. Also, one of them after only a few hours of use has one of the diodes flickering. Unfortunately I didn't get them installed in time for amazon's return, so now I am stuck with them. DO NOT buy these bulbs unless you want extremely blue light.<br /><br />I am attaching a photo, on the left is the incandescent lamps I was going to replace and on the right is this bulb.
B000TYQB14|5|Yes bolted right on. Got it the next day. Dealer wanted 250.00 to install one😡. Thanks😎
B004W8R6RG|3|It's a real metal frame. The only downside is the the letters & emblems are not engraved, or laser etched, or ect... They're stickers. I really wish they weren't stickers. But they are held in place very well though i wonder how many car washes they take before the do start to com off any. I will definitely update. :) The integrity of this License plate frame is very well made overall. But I like my things engraved that way they can't be removed or destroyed in any way. The product is very nice though, but I will probably order somewhere else for a different style.
B004WNFYAW|4|perfect fix for my 03 audi a6 3.0.  be careful not to mess with the sensor before installing as it sets once you put it in.  Might set it before you install if you mess around with it.
B000FQBWCY|5|Used for multiple XS Power batteries and it works excellently! It's not quite the some amperage as more expensive chargers but this is definitely the best budget charger in my opinion! No issues here!
B00LOS5XAY|5|Worked great for 1/10 the cost of factory.
B0049ELS54|5|Very pleased with this purchase and associated services for delivery.  Thank you.
B00PKRW0LK|5|We've been using these while our teenage son practices for his road test.  They are bright and visible and make a difference.  Before we had them on, people would crowd him, cut him off and otherwise behave poorly.  Once they were on, we've noticed a significant decrease in that activity.  We've used them at freeway speeds while driving through a thunderstorm and they held up great.  This was definitely a good purchase!
B00TABFBAO|5|Aswome quality will order again
B001B5E0N6|5|AWESOME
B008D15U8U|4|They work fine and a great utility if you just need a basic clock... anywhere you want to put it.
B002PZZ5PI|5|Great product arrived quickly and it fit my Harley road king just like it said it would. Now gas is safe and secure and it matches the original gas cap. The key lock is hidden by a cover that you can't even tell will slide to the side to give you access to the key lock. Would reccomend and buy again.
B005VIMY9Q|3|Fits exactly like it should except it has two holes in the tank.  Our truck only had one.  It would have been nice to know as I returned a tank before this for the same reason.
B0056DJLI8|5|My wife loves it.
B00XWIAF7K|5|This tape is awesome!!! Put it on my sportster. Looks just as good as seller photos.
B001U2DPUE|5|I went from 12 channels to 21, simple 5 minute installation. Well worth the small purchase price.
B00XDAB0DK|5|I absolutely love the quality of this trunk organizer, it will definitely last for years! I think it's a perfect size, not too small and not too big where you'll have hard time carrying it on your own. The uses for this organizer is endless! My kids play sports so I can pack up all their sport equipment in it, I work at a preschool and constantly have to carry things between home and school so this definitely will come in handy but first I tested this at the grocery store. I only needed a few things, I placed it in my shopping cart to hold all my groceries and after I paid, all I had to do was place the whole thing in my trunk! When I got home I simply carried it into the kitchen, put everything away then folded the organizer. It folds very flat and so I was able to keep it in my large handbag/tote until it was needed again. I have a small Toyota hatchback and this truck organizer didn't take up much space at all, I still had lots of room for other things. I received this Heavy Duty auto trunk organizer for free to test, inspect and give my honest opinion. For me, I love it! Before I has this organizer I used a large reusable bag but it's already falling apart. I'll never have to worry about that with this organizer. Trust me, you will not be disappointed in owning this! I will definitely be buying more of this organizer during the holidays, it will make a great gift..and perfect for holding all my purchases too!
B00H6ETIWY|4|Had to drill out the mounting holes slightly to get them to fit mule pro fxt.  Other than that they work  good.
B006LGKIM2|5|Item received as described, thanks.
B00TWOFAKA|5|Nice
B001G8AIMU|5|Great product
B00YIX74V8|5|These roll bars are amazing. Ive taken some pretty wild trails, and have needed these to assist some of my passengers.
B00LPIA3T4|5|1. Case - Awesome<br />It has push button for opening and cover also has spring so opens by itself. Screw's socket is swing type. When you open the case, it rises up to 90degree from tilted position. Even if you shake it hard, nothing's going to happened. All the screws and grips are tightly positioned.<br /><br />2. Yellow plastic with rubber grip doesnt look expensive but works fine. This has magnetic. Easy to insert diffirent type of tips. Personally i wish this has tightening fastener so it will be very secure.<br /><br />3.Screws(tips)<br />Quality looks good. I didn't Test out how strong it is. But this is just precision. Don't. Use for tough ones. I'm not sure this is stainless or not. I hope it is.
B00PZ3VC36|5|It works great so far
B0064ONFBC|5|Just what I needed when I lost my extra set of keys.  Works great!
B000EDUUJO|5|Perfect
B00BOMVM32|4|Just took a trailer trip and the worked well.  I would order the longer ones next time.
B004HNYKIO|5|Husband loves how easy it is to get on and off.  I personally don't know if this will prevent the truck from being stolen but we will see.
B000M5X0MS|5|Works good
B00OAACLGW|5|perfect fit
B001AIZ5HY|5|Kit worked well.  I used it to restore two 12 year-old headlights that had turned yellow/green.  I ended up with extra pads and compound.  I would highly recommend this kit.
B0028SJDDC|5|Makes a big difference in reducing wind.
B003QK95MK|5|Perfect. Just what I needed fory car
B0093XLGVM|1|realmente es una mierda, no alumbra nada d nada
B007SOODHC|3|seems to be a good tool. After ordering I found out the tool was the wrong one. I now don't need the item and the return policy makes it not worth returning.
B004JJR4KW|4|The product was good and delivered in atmely manner, but it was the wrong size
B00SSM2UXC|5|Does it's job
B007AOQQ52|3|Good
B00HX526CU|5|My honest best purchase yet. I love the magnetic bottom and it's extremely bright. Works well for giving an extra hand when you don't have one to spare for holding a light.<br /><br />It has a pivoting body as well, so you can get a good angle nearly every time.
B000E2CVDI|5|Good oil filter and good price compared to auto stores.
B002IZDM50|5|Used this on a boat city water connection. The old connection was working fine, but i figured after 20 years it made sense to have a new swivel piece. No issues, easy installation and product appears to be of great quality. Price was excellent as well, half of the local marine store.
B000GANZ1A|5|These fit great / used them for my dump trailer / trailer tires are pricey enough, for me its worth protecting.
B001HBWMI4|5|OK Shipping time / Good Quality / I love it !!!
B00396HQH2|4|On my Scion they make the oil filter small and my other oil wrenches had a hard time gripping the filter.  I chose the Lisle oil filter wrench because I like the metal band type of oil wrenches, they're good for both loosening and tightening (as long as the oil wrench band is square with filter housing) oil filters without damaging the outside oil filter housing.  The textured inner band helps the band from slipping around the filter as you loosen or tighten the filter.  Also kudos for the textured handle it greatly helps oily hands from slipping off. Lisle tools are quality made.
B00DE7M9FA|5|Fits perfectly on 2003 Nissan Altima, installation is a bit tricky but there are good tutorials on youtube that helped me out. Recommend looking at a couple.

B007TG7HG8|5|Great wiper
B005SMUOR4|3|Tool set was good but it turns out the use for replacing the Maytag Neptune bearing set was not totally a fit. However it worked with the use of 7&#34; screws and nuts. Slightly larger and finer threaded screws would have almost been perfect.  The You Tube videos were sales pieces using special made tools which were being sold by demos. But videos were totally practical to get the ideas across.
B00WRJI3BU|5|I own a 2010 Polaris 800 RZRs and when the time came to set up a dual battery setup isolating the back up battery so I could run my radio, lights and accessories without fear of killing the primary I looked to options for isolators.  The TrueAm was highly recommended on several forums so I did some research, part of which was calling the manufacturer.  I was impressed that my calls were answered by a real person and on top of that the owner of the company.  He walked me through the process and explained clearly how his product worked and gave recommendations on the install.  I must say it was real easy to do and the instructions were crystal clear.  Took me about 30 minutes, mostly trying to figure out ways to run the wires so they would look nice and neat and be tucked away correctly.  Been a few months now and the system works great.  I have a CTEK battery tender hooked up with a quick connect to the main battery and when it is stored in the garage the main is charged to full before it switches over and charges the Aux battery.  While out in the field I can turn off the RZR and run my radio, lights, and any other accessory, completely dump the Aux and still have a full fresh main battery to start the RZR.  Very happy with the purchase and impressed with the quality of the TruAm Isolator.
B000JFHNEC|2|Wouldn't convert airplane A/C!
B006N932YI|5|right item for the price,work as described.
B000W0MOKC|5|Well made, durable, stainless steel construction with a pick resistant circular cylinder lock and an effective weatherproof cap.  I'm using them on a utility trailer's doors.  Note that the outside diameter is too large to lock my coupler.
B004FDIMJY|5|Fast delivery and working just fine as expected.
B00KF2251A|4|One slight issue...the container  did not have any install instructions.  I sort of rigged it !!!
B00LBF5AYO|5|Good product

B000GZRGCY|5|Easy to install and looks great.
B0002MABGE|2|Would work for smaller dogs that aren't trying to get out. Doesn't work for big dogs at all.
B00GLLW3AM|4|Just what I needed. I will use the light as a backup/worklight. Arrived promptly.
B0040CZ79S|5|exactly what it does.
B0002SQUJU|5|Best tool I've seen for compressing the &#34;screw and push&#34; type caliper pistons. Used it on a 95 ford tarsus rear brakes. Very well made and a lot easier  to use than some other ones on the market. It comes in a sturdy case, and has a good selection of ends to fit a wide range of auto's. One DIY brake job pays for the tool - so will be money ahead when you do the next one.
B00N8LUV4I|3|One headlight is blue, one is white, I ordered white

B00YB9XW3S|5|Great product.  Bike sounds great.  And gives me about 10 extra pony,s
B00JJ5H49M|1|This is a very cheap cover. Looks bad and nothing like the original. The decal of the bronco looks off and poorly done. Spend the extra 20 bucks or so and get a real one.
B008ZDYLC2|5|So far... a very cool gadget and I'm very pleased with the purchase.  If you have limited mechanical ability (you maybe know how to change a car battery and/or the oil) then you may want to read through the rest of my narrative.<br /><br />I recently took my 2004 Dodge Ram 1500 to the dealership for recall work (the airbags were gonna kill me apparently) and I knew I had an engine light issue that had been nagging for a long time.  I didn't think too much of it (the check engine light) because I had it looked at by a mechanic who said he checked it out and cleared it... but then it came back again.  Anyway, after fixing the airbags, the tech at the dealership noted that there was oil in the air filter and something was wrong, but he'd have to run a full diagnostic and pull apart some things to figure it out.  I already had this tool on order so I told them &#34;no thanks&#34; and just drove it home.<br /><br />In my case, I approached this purchase with a fair amount of skepticism thinking maybe 50/50 I could figure it out and use it.  Hobby-wise, I'm somewhat mechanically inclined, but nothing beyond small single-stroke engine tinkering and maybe changing the oil and/or battery on a large car.  Aside from that, if I opened the hood and didn't see a large on/off switch to throw, I'd be pretty lost.<br /><br />So, the gadget arrives!  It comes with an extremely brief manual which is pretty much a quick start guide that tells you how to first turn it on and check to see what software version is installed.  When you check yours write down the number it gives you for later reference.  Then you use the provided USB cable to attach to a PC and install the setup software from the website the manual gives you.  I went ahead and installed the software even though the number quoted as the latest version looked familiar...  I didn't pay too close attention at step 1, but I think I ended up re-installing the same software in the unit, so I probably could've saved 10 mins if I had just written the number down.  Anyway, no big deal... it downloaded the software, updated itself and good-to-go.  Very simple; anyone who thinks this step is difficult must not own a PC.<br /><br />Now out to my truck.  I plugged it in under the dash and used the auto detect feature which pulled up 2004 Dodge Ram 5.2 V8, and then it asked me if my version had ABS or not... I selected the correct non-ABS choice.  Ran the vehicle diagnostics and everything seemed to check out &#34;OK&#34; with a couple &#34;n/a&#34;.  Then I looked at the DTC codes... there were 4 issues that came up.  One suggested replacing the PCV valve ($24 part, that required I remove a couple bolts and take off the plastic air handler on top of engine), another said that I had an EGR failure (that sounded bad, but turns out it's just a $40 part that bolts on the front of the engine).  The third item said there was a small leak in my evap system, or something like that... turns out that means tighten your gas cap!  LOL.  ...and then there was something about a fuel level sensor fault.  Which I think I caused by running the dam thing until there was no more gas and it stalled out just as I pulled up to a pump!  (better lucky than good I s'pose)<br /><br />So, with the above info in hand, the gas tank was already filled...  gas cap secured...  two down.  Looked up &#34;how to replace a PCV valve on YouTube&#34; looked easy, and it was!  Looked up &#34;how to replace an EGR valve&#34; also looked easy.  Done and done!  Took about 4-6 hours in total.  In the process had to change out that oil-gobbed air filter, also changed the oil and oil filter while I was at it.  The small backfeed hoses that run into the air filter from the top of the oil fill spout were all mucked up with oil that I had to ream out and clean-up.  I think I may have contributed to that a bit by over filling the oil a bit on my last oil change attempt, all cleaned up now and was extra careful not to put too much in this time.With the work done, last step was to plug unit back in and erase the offending codes, which I did.  The check engine light did not instantly disappear... which was a little of a let down at first.  But at that point I was ready to wash up and call it a day.  The next morning I went out and started it up... NO CHECK ENGINE LIGHTS!  ...wow, first time in probably 2-3 years, and after who knows how many techs have looked at it.  So been driving it around a few days now and still no engine light.  Will take a look at the air filter at the end of the week and see if any signs of oil, but all seems well.<br /><br />In the process of playing with this thing it reported back 3 or 4 engine codes.  Not only that, it told me the most common fix for the problem and then also stated about 3-5 other things that techs had to do to fix the problem if the top fix did not work.  In my case, the recommended fixes all worked.  I had to look up a few things online to help me decipher, watched some youtube videos, learned a little bit about my engine and the check engine light.  In tinkering under the hood, noticed that each part seemed to have a diagnostic wire/plug coming out of it... Ah, so that's how these things know what's wrong.  ...and now I know I can use this on pretty much any car built after 2002 and expect it to work.  So this time, yeah I fixed everything for less than $100.  Next time it might pull up a code that is beyond my reach, but at least I can take it in to a mechanic and not feel entirely at their mercy.With the work done, last step was to plug unit back in and erase the offending codes, which I did.

B007SWVZG6|5|Fit was perfect on my 2014 Subaru WRX.<br />Just put it in on my 3rd oil change.<br />Magnet was very strong. Hoping this collects some metal shavings.
B000AY2O82|5|Love it thanks.
B003ZWHNG4|1|This is one of those products on Amazon that I believe has BOGUS reviews. The first two reviews both state that the unit is &#34; Quick and easy&#34; to replace. This is an absolute lie. I have been in the auto repair business for 50 years, am ASE certified and own hundreds of professional tools and I am a Toyota Previa specialist. This job still took literally 2 hours to install and was very difficult to accomplish without damaging the vehicle AND specialty tools ARE required. I am saddened that Amazon lets these reviews be published.<br />Handle was of average quality and NOT OEM. Will pick different brand next time.
B00068KU1K|4|Not the best plastic polish, but does its job. You can use this to polish out wet sanding from clear coats.
B0090Q27NS|5|Install was quick and easy - always test fit first!!!  The convenience of having this always ready is great.  No fumbling for the fold up shade, no storing it.  So far it is perfect!!!
B00AC6VMW2|5|Outstanding product!!  Great sound and performance.  I highly recommend these to anyone looking for that throw back look. It really cleaned up the look of my 07 heritage softail classic.

B00FXWLD88|5|Great connectors heavy duty
B000WEOSJS|5|Wonderful quality and great fit!
B001GDU1QS|2|Not truly custom fit. Does NOT make accommodations for antenna. In the instructions it requires you to cut a hole, if the manufacturer knows of issue yet still claims &quot;custom fit&quot; then that is misleading.
B0069ARUKI|4|Great for Truck bed compartmentalizing.  Easy to micro adjust.  Good Grip
B006MJZ8V4|5|everything came as ordered, no shipping problems.
B00YW8KTKM|4|Rear Seat fit really well as long as you take the time to take out the seats, attach the covers, then re-install the seats. The front covers are just ok, not very tight on a 2008 chevy cobalt, will slide down when sitting down, but overall great product for the price.

At least once a year I was getting the blue/gray cover from the blue/gray superstore for about $30 a pop and they are as waterproof as a kleenex and shred just about as easily after baking in the sun for a few months.  So here we are.<br /><br />Seems pretty sturdy out of the box, material feels strong and the cover is fairly heavy.  The fabric seems about as thick as a a pair or work jeans and it is fairly stiff.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the SP size that apparently is the only size available does NOT fit my 1999 Suzuki Bandit 1200s with factory style mirrors.  It's close, but I found myself making the OJ Simpson glove face, it just didn't quite fit. Whether the Bandit with the mini fairing or if you've done the naked conversion, it just wouldn't fit right with stock-type mirrors.  Maybe it would fit the Bandit if I had bar-end mirrors, but I didn't take my mirrors off to check.  Definitely wouldn't come close to fitting with the canvas tail bag I often have on it.<br /><br />Seems like it would be a perfect fit for a modern liter bike or smaller with no tank bags or tail bags.<br /><br />I am keeping it because it actually fits my wife's 1982 Honda Urban Express scooter with a rear basket pretty good.  49cc worth of 2hp madness is probably not what Dowco had in mind in designating this the Sport BIke size, but that's one less awful blue and silver cover to keep buying too.<br /><br />I bought a can of water repellent already for it so I was glad to see that the manufacturer recommends this.  Also includes a lifetime warranty card to fill out.<br /><br />Only reason it only gets four stars is because the under strap is WAY too long and I'm gonna have to do something about it.<br /><br />Got this lightning quick, ordered on a Friday and it arrived Monday.
B00OZYHOE2|5|For the price, these are probably the best biking goggles I've had. They breathe well, and even after a long time out on a hot summer day I could still see clearly. Very recommended!
B00K1N43M2|5|Perfect
B008USQP8K|5|This lock is easy to install and remove.  It fit my 2013 F-150 perfectly.  I am glad to have protection against possible gas theft in addition to protection against vandalism.
B00RFZLMDW|5|Over all, Siren and air horn sounds great! Extremely lord and good quality. But the haldheld intercom is a waste of time and it right out sucks... I haven't tried buying an after market handheld for it to see if it works better, but the one it comes with is a piece of junk all together and has horrible transmission....but who even uses it right? So it dosent even matter. What matters is Going to a call and being seen and heard coming into an intersection. If that's what you are looking for? This is the product you need to buy because this will do that 100℅. I love it and I will most definitely praise it for what it is.
B00HUGND6K|5|arrived on time and looks great
B000C1LLAK|5|Very easy to install. Very smooth and quiet.
B000NWA6B8|1|This just arrived via China Post in a plastic bag.  No way this is AC-Delco OEM part for my vehicle.  Very disappointed.
B002NFDR8C|5|Very good
B00LV6HYYM|5|Looks good and functions even better.
B0002YW5P2|5|This little thing has come in handy more times that I would like.  However, I love all its features.  I love that is short to get under those supportive but hard to reach areas.  I like that you can screw the top up to give you less space you would have to pump.  I love its overall height.  I love that the sticks come apart into two pieces and you can easily store all parts.  All for a decent price.
B009I33728|5|Excellent quality wiring and connections.  Definitely improved headlight brightness! Came with instructions.
B0007VBUBK|5|Great price. Quick shipping!
B001BAD3IY|3|decal went on easily but the color faded within a few months. I ordered black, it should not color fade like this one
B005KVLX50|4|this will work great
B00R59INIU|5|great deal .
B00LHUI4XM|5|Nice.
B00QKX1MCQ|4|This is a really good intake works great
B002UVDEAU|5|AWESOME......my window works!!!
B0089LT54O|5|Great
B0019JUA9W|5|The best muffler system I ever had!!
B003Y8EFRO|4|very good
B0045MVIBE|1|Lasted 6 months, poor quality.
B0091OE6II|4|Works pretty well. It's made of plastic, so the part that you slip the shoulder belt into ends up bending upwards after a while, causing the belt to slip out.  Just need to replace them every once in a while
B002ESEMXC|5|supr great ,easy to install with no problems so far been a few months
B00CAFI0XC|5|worked as describrd
B00HESESX6|5|Great buy
B004QP8BNS|5|tool for my husband. he loves it . he uses it at work.
B007JM48Q4|5|Perfect. Just what I wanted. Thank you!!!
B004GEYCBY|5|great service and product
B009TA4B84|5|Exactly what we needed for mud, snow, and that stuff that gets on your boots when you work in a barn! Makes the car easy to clean out and helps keep odor from staying in the car. Great product.
B001CQWM8E|4|Great improvement for my Kubota.  Only problem was it did not tighten up on the smaller Kubota pipe.  A small rubber shim inside the clamp fixed that.
B00X9TW24Q|4|My son loves his helmet it was a great choice
B000JFRHZ2|5|Very high quality with just the right amount of connection points to keep it in place. This fit my 2013 Moto Guzzi Stelvio with both panniers on. Just a little snug but it fits nonetheless. Highly recommended.
B003ZWE6W8|5|Arrived in great condition and excellent condition.
B006FXUMO0|4|Worked right the first time but needs better direction on lens removal
B005UQQARG|5|great quality and Very durable
B00FH8P1DG|5|DO NOT look into light when trying them out the are Bright
B00ON7K48O|5|This product has exceded my expectations! I cannot say enough about it. As a car enthusiast there is nothing better than having a glass-like finish on your car and the strata coating does just that. The Strata Coating has been on my Infiniti for over a year now and I kid you not it still shines like the day it was applied. I haven't found a product that gives the same finish and is so easy to apply until now. Dont take my word for it, look at the pictures I've attached!
B000JZY5ZW|3|A little bit too strong of an arm. My wife has difficulty shutting the back window now.
B006Z907TY|5|Works great!
B004LEC432|5|Excellent set of open locking lug nuts!  I will still order another key or so!  One NEEDS this type of lugnut for the cars with long spacers or deep wheels.
B00P7VVIS0|5|Arrived as expected and latches great in my 2013 CT200H.
B00D8BFJP4|5|Fantastic
B00TPXAWKQ|5|Love it. Would recommend to anyone.
B001UJB7MK|5|Love it! Thanks!
B00514ABY0|5|I've tried a lot of heat deflectors, and some 3x the cost of this one, but nothing works better. Looks great on the bike too.
B00XCOOYJO|5|Durable, accurate and easy to use.
B00K6B1JOY|5|It solve my problem with the turn single flashing fast. thx
B00QGA9III|4|Looks really good  with the black  on my  bike.
B00PH98ABA|2|Poor quality
B000VZJ712|4|Good price, and not needing to gap them is a plus.
B000VDYQXS|5|Great material! Great coloring. Very happy about this order
B009OBVS20|5|This item Works great considering it's price and the fact that it's a retail car care product. Remember to keep the DA power tool moving so that it doesn't &#34;burn&#34; a spot into the car.
B00029JMIK|5|A little added extra insurance for my 6AL. Sometimes I get a little crazy in my early Bronco.
B0040HD0XS|5|I have been buffing boats for years with a variable speed a Makita, I also paid a hefty price, not only for the tool, but because the weight of it, ruined my shoulders. This unit has variable speed and seem to be a bit more user friendly. The pads you get with it is all you need and very easy to wash back out. I just buffed out a weather beaten fiberglass RV using a 1 1/2 speed. Looks like new again....I used Ultimate compound and wax..will stick with this!
B003TTL0TE|5|I bought this item with the Meguiar's Gold Class Car Wash Shampoo & Conditioner. When I received this in the mail - I was shocked at how soft and durable the product seemed to be. Even though rain was predicted, it prompted me to go out to wash the car just to try it out. The mitt is easy to use and would fit any hand size. Leaves no micro-scratches (which is difficult to do on dark paint). Large amount of surface area to catch dust and dirt (and soap, of course!). I can tell that this mitt will withstand the test of time when taken care of properly. Be sure to rinse thoroughly after each use to remove traces of soap and hang dry.
B006SQYLNC|5|Truck looks totally different.  Looks more like a high end truck.  Fitment was really good.
B001GK9EBE|2|The problem I have is none of the holes for mounting the connector to lined up with the connector. I had to drill new holes to make them work.
B00ANI1QXO|5|👌🏾👍🏾👍🏾
B007WR25KW|5|They held on just fine.  You may need to pull the straps tighter when the weather gets more humid and temperature cools at night.<br />Use rubber bands and roll up the extra strap length  to prevent them flapping in the wind.
B00VMH3UBG|5|Looks great and works great. Gives off slightly blue light.
B00RM327NG|5|like it a lot
B00HE1BQWY|5|Fast shipping! Instructions in email were spot on!, only took seconds to program!
B004UTCSL6|5|I'm happy with my purchase.
B00CMNY3P6|1|Bad. Very Bad
B00I9PGXHM|5|Exact replacement at a very reasonable price. The truck runs like new!!
B00WH1X1A6|5|I think it says it all
B00REJXFM0|5|I liked it the minute it took it out of the box, I just didn't find it easy to install. Had to tweak it a little so that it would fit my 2006 frontier
B008OISDD6|2|Fit, style, ease of instillation, over all looks, keeping rain out, and allowing flow were great.<br />However, with the windows closed, they seem to amplify road noise, not wind, but road.<br />Will probably remove them, as it was too much.
B00BHD1JO0|5|Nice tip. Good quality.They Look perfect on my 2014 f150
B00AOC79GM|4|I bought this cover because the black dash was getting really HOT. I was hoping that this lighter color would reflect some of the sun and maintain a cooler interior temperature. That didn't work, oh well.<br />I would like to give the product 3 stars and the seller 5 stars. First, the seller sent a dash mat that did not fit my dash well at all. I asked for an exchange or refund. The seller promptly had a new one made and sent to me. The new one had a much better fit.
B00411QIAU|4|Just enough. The screw covers did not fit.
B00QNZ5OP2|5|good quality product
B00T4BVZHS|5|Great product. Great price. Solved my problem. Awesome.
B000A0EJD4|5|Good Quality!
B007D5R4GI|5|Delivered on time and it was exactly like the pictures. Perfect!
B00020CB2S|5|I applied the product on the interior of the trunk and rear strut towers, in addition to a small amount on the cabin floor behind each front wheel.  Road noise was reduced significantly.  I recommend this product!
B00N44JQC2|5|PERFECT REPLACEMENT FOR THE FACTORY DECALS
B002QOYS42|5|Great, well made product!
B004UIUIGO|1|Lights are bad quality and are not very bright at all. Only would recommend for looks not functionality. Brackets are also very poor quality and screws do not tighten at all.
B00IUWLZMW|5|This battery, for the price, is amazing. The built-in voltmeter is an added bonus that comes in very handy.
B005N6Z3YO|3|Great shirt but runs small
B00SVKSF80|4|Good decal, just seemed kind of drab
B002MB594M|5|helps locate cars in your blind spot effectively.
B00B0U45LO|4|Nice quality shirt, but its a bit thinner than expected. Also, I'm not sure how long the printed ///M logo will last on the shirt after a few washes. That's the only thing that worries me but overall nice shirt.
B003Z4BBSI|5|👍👍
B00JA3BMDW|5|Works great. I was worried about the data refresh rate, but it works fine. I prefer the screen and handle shape to my previous RYOBI temperature gun.
B00H338T9G|5|Fast Shipping / Good Quality / I love it !!!
B0044AZ426|4|Fits perfectly.
B000FW4LQC|5|fast service and great price.
B00EKNDTME|5|Came fast all the way from China.  Polarized.  May simply need to rotate bulb in socket 180 degrees. Bright and fits in my boat cabin fixture.
B000C5HZ24|5|Perfect fit.
B00E6BZ8WE|4|Wasn't quite perfect fit and back adhesive did nothing to keep it stuck. Had to super glue them in. Look great though.
B00NFFPUKC|5|Great product! Exceptional quality!
B0031OVARY|5|Previous landing gear switch on our 2007 Cougar 5th wheel failed internally.  Fuse for our landing gear motor was 40 Amps. When I pulled the old switch out, markings on it indicated that it was a 201 Series switch made by Sigma in Elkhart, IN.  On their website, found the appropriate switch, a 201S (DPDT Momentary On/Off/Momentary On) rated at 20 Amps at 125VAC, 15 Amps at 250VAC, 20 Amps Continuous and 40 Amps Peak at 12VDC.  The price of the switch from Sigma's consumer website was reasonable, however, the shipping was twice the price of the switch.<br /><br />Did a lot of searching to discover this JR Products switch with the same ratings and physical dimensions as the original Sigma switch.  Ordered this (since price with free Amazon Prime shipping was considerably less than Sigma's).  Once the switch arrived, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the switch itself was actually made by Sigma -- a perfect replacement for the bad switch (only difference is this was only available in black whereas the original switch was white -- no worries, looks fine in black).<br /><br />Popped the new switch out of the new bezel, pushed wires onto the new switch spade connectors, and popped the new switch into the existing white bezel on the exterior of the 5th wheel.<br /><br />Works like a charm.
B00669K6RQ|5|It sounds amazing. Not too loud.customer service was amazing and it came in fast. Low growl. You'll need to,order a test pipe and a turbo to down pipe gasket.
B0042VTYXM|5|important to have
B0015PN010|5|I had the hardest time getting my lower control arms off on my mazda 6. With this tool, a Dewalt Impact Drill, and a 4lbs sledge hammer all going at once this works PERFECT. To include a torch and PB Blaster.<br /><br />I have recommended this and will continue too as this was a life saver.<br /><br />Only problem...... It has a problem with cross threading with the amount of torque I was putting on it. But with the abuse I put in it I removed 4 ball joints.
B0089KNC8A|5|Great product and I beat the rip-off I would have gotten at the dealer.......nuff said.
B00DSCZ57A|5|Work great on my 2004 Chevy Tahoe.
B00802GVFI|5|These lights are great.  Put them in my Jeep Wrangler, used the stock reflectors, and they make a world of difference.  Bought the 6000k and it is a nice white light...and matches my led lights mounted on other areas of the Jeep.  Would highly recommend.
B00PSRORH2|5|Works great. Sticks and stays to the window without the suction cups. Glad we purchased them.
B00YIAGHW8|5|FINALLY a seller who had the right part for my car.  Thanks for knowing what a Saturn SC2 needs!  xxx
B001NAP2D6|5|Extremely nice product. Came well packaged and did just what I needed it to. Couldn't be happier with the purchase. Would suggest to all.
B0013T5V6K|5|Great
B002SB00QS|4|Love it
B00BCR8SCW|4|Only problem was with the teeny tiny hooks, which would not work!  I  had to purchase larger s-hooks to make it work!!
B00TER3F6G|5|Very nice...!!
B008I7R622|5|Perfect fit for my 2004 Chevy Venture!
B00FMV0WFA|5|it works fine and it fits perfectly, I agree with almost everyone else for 50 or 60 thousand dollars it should have been included by Chevy
B002EBSLKO|5|2 or 3 months since installed. Working just fine. Seems high quality. Delivered on time. It is a bit beefier than your average oil filter. Be sure you have room for it.
B00LDWZB12|5|Excellent quality, exactly as advertised.
B00SHZUSWU|1|Did not fit!
B001ELZIAG|5|Perfectly fit my 2011 camry A+
B00ZG6JKUO|2|the stickers came in two separate bags 1 bag was a complete duplicate of the first bag I ordered 200 random stickers I got a hundred stickers and gave the rest my kids I bought them to decorate a guitar it was a very lame purchase..I made do with what I have but I'm going to have to find some cooler stickers to fill in the blanks and I would have been better off of ordering 50 instead of 200 of the same stickers
B001G4Z5J0|5|I like it !
B001TLC12E|2|This system seems designed for passenger cars only or did not take into account my 2014 Toyota Tundra does not have rear folding seats (upper portion fixed against rear wall and does not fold like they show in all the &#34;how to install&#34; videos).  There was no way to work the straps into the back of my seats.  The front two, and rear lower, covers work as advertised.  However, on the back seat they attempt to make it a one size fits all.  That is understandable due to the large amount of different vehicle sizes, styles, and makes.  But the zippers do not make the rear covers fit the back seats of my particular vehicle in anything that resembles a reasonable fit.  I created a small tear in the front driver's side cover and will not be returning them.<br />On the plus side, if indeed you do own a passenger car of sedan, I believe these will work fine for you!  Little disappointed Amazon told me, in big bold letters on my order, that it would indeed fit my truck when it in fact will not
B001DRP9E6|5|Good filter and simply to install..
B000ALDY7A|4|Color matches but it is difficult to apply it smoothly.  The ball-point pen side worked when testing it out on a piece of cardboard, but would not apply any ink when using it on the actual vehicle.
B00SLKSRWO|5|Fit great easy installation in 1-1/2-2 hours looks great
B00FA44WX2|5|Extremely easy to install and makes charging easy.  Make sure that you get the 25' cord as it make connecting much easier.<br />The only thing that I would suggest is that the terminals needed for the wiring should be included with the charger itself.  The terminals block is small so you will have to locate the proper connectors.
B00EDELV6G|5|Fit great
B003S1RQ2S|5|excelent
B000CQFPCK|5|Good choice
B00FEXB296|2|not very well made.  has a large pimple.
B00HRSRAGA|5|Took it out, snapped it on, could not ask for anymore
B00009WC2S|5|Still ain't put in. Lol
B0074EJ9CK|5|I love these steering wheel covers. I got this one for my 2015 Prius. I have used them on a Honda fit and three different Prius's they fit great.
B004C443QW|3|A little smaller than expected.
B0043DJVPA|5|perfect fit, working fine
B00KNNPK4K|1|Picture shows something different than what I received.
B00QKLFFWG|5|Fast delivery, easy install
B009NHW8HE|3|The item come on time and injoying the item.
B00M9DCMNE|5|Works great for plate light on my truck
B00LORNGRW|5|Nice light. Plug and play
B00B1K9XOC|3|As description
B00684TD6O|5|Good quality. Works well. I messed up the programming sequence and had to call customer service. They were very friendly and helpful. Walked me through it and the remote works well.
B00IPMAAXW|3|Little larger and bulky than I wanted.  It holds the phone but is too bulky.
B00279OSFK|5|Works great thanks Amazon for the fast delivery 😃
B000FQ1S6Y|2|Doesn't fit right for85 cj. The metal shoe backing plate rubs. I'm going to try a different brand
B000AMXQDG|5|Great shine and half the cost of the Auto store!
B002LWRQKM|5|shipped fast and not crushed
B00NF1QP1E|4|worked very well
B001V9OZXM|4|A HUGE improvement over the stock pegs on a 2005 BMW R1200GS.  Huge.  Can't state that enough.<br /><br />I wish they were just a smidge wider to fit my gigantic feet, but I'll take what I can get.<br /><br />I'm only using the small (10mm?) cleats since I ride with regular shoes and combat boots and they're perfect for an 80/20 guy like me.<br /><br />It would also be nice if they came with some sort of container for the unused cleats so they don't get lost, and despite the instructions making it look like they came with new springs, I had to reuse the stock springs.  Not a complaint, just worth pointing out for future purchasers.
B000C7Y8FO|5|Worked as advertised!
B009B8UXTK|5|Works Great, folds easily.
B006DAD2BK|5|Excellent quality and sound.  One thing I wish could be addressed is a true sound clip for my particular vehicle with dB ratings at various RPM's.  I started with the touring exhaust since I had touring axle backs on my Mustang GT.  These were much &#34;quieter,&#34; and I'd say this S type is similar in volume to the touring on the GT...go figure.  Return and exchange was painless as always with Amazon.  Install was easy (not quite so easy to remove OEM, but got it done in a few hours.
B005NLQAHS|4|Works well with Torque and doesn't seem to have any issues.
B000E7YYDS|4|Fantastic nozzle, delivers a precise and stead steady stream, multi-functional.  An attached shut off valve would  be helpful.
B002OQ82X0|5|Match ITP Delta steel wheels.
B00192JGN0|5|These are impressive for style and strength and thickness. Good price
B00NIZZZ5Y|5|Worked perfectly in my 2014 Honda Accord Sport.
B002GTKAHQ|5|600 miles with out an issue great product for the money !
B00BKWGISK|5|I have used about a dozen of these controllers in outside applications for three season camp solar lighting systems.  Over the past three years (taking the control systems inside during winter months) I have not had a single failure.  Given the price and how well they work, I would highly recommend these units to anyone.
B00PTQOF4W|3|Don't light up
B008FCD8LI|5|Keeps the small things from rolling around in the back of my Chevy Volt.  I use it every day.
B00B6SB5VI|5|great product
B000G7AJTO|5|I haven't used it yet, it looks like good quality item.
B0000AZ6WB|5|Gift
B00MQAFHUU|4|So far so good.  Now let see how it holds up in the next few months.
B00ELFQ5AY|5|It's good
B00JFTC0T6|3|Looks good, but it doesn't fit tight.  Had to use mounting tape to ensure a tight fit.  Now let see how it holds up.  Stars can only go down from here.
B004DRRMRK|5|Price was very reasonable.  Arrived in a reasonable length of time.  Hoping the lenses don't discolor with time as the originals did.
B00II8HHP2|5|Perfect fit and was delivered quickly
B00ZQXU67I|5|Bought it and installed it on my 2015 Ram.  works great. easy to install.  Hard wired the whole thing.
B00SIBI8IO|5|Fast shipping time / Good Quality item / I like it.
B008SEBQ2G|4|Let's be honest - if you are doing this mod you are doing it for looks not for reception.  Any tom, dick, or harry should understand that when you replace an antenna with one that is 1/10 as long you can anticipate 1/10 the signal reception.<br /><br />That being said, this antenna looks excellent.  It's rugged.  No cheap rubber coatings, nothing to fall off, etc.  It's well made and looks great.  I've tested with local stations and in town they work fine but the drop off is very noticeable as you move away.  I don't care because I listen to XM or my phone 99% of the time.<br /><br />For someone worried about signal strength DON'T DO IT!  If you want to do something that looks better, do a full delete and move the antenna to the bed rails behind the cab.
B000B8YDUY|1|Doesn't work,waste of money.
B00CGNCNPY|5|Arrived promptly, installed easily, has been reliable and about 1/3 the weight of the lead acid factory battery.
B00590WYAA|5|Bolted right on.  Directions said it wouldn't fit my 12 fj....tried it anyways and sure enough. It did fit.
B0031I20EC|4|just the right size
B0046PR738|5|good
B003RVRQJW|5|First place we took it said it wouldn't work and they couldn't program it. Took it to a Jeep dealer and all good to go! Great product. We only had one key so programming it our self wasn't an option.
B00S08UO0A|5|should have come with install instructions, otherwise, i love it on my RV  Work GREAT!!
B00BVQ5S3Q|5|AWESOME......my window works!!!
B00H2VTGZK|5|Great product! The installation is very easy as long as you don't rush and are through with your work. They work very well and make a world of difference in both visibility and overall look of your bike. I would definitely recommend it!
B00BD4SK0Y|5|These are perfect seat covers for my husband's work van. These take a lot of abuse and haven't torn or even snagged.
B0016ZL5E8|5|This Gasket worked perfectly, fit very well easy to install and bolts lined up easily. I would buy it again.
B00CMC5BDU|5|Great
B00M1HUNDY|5|Just purchased this cover in black w/ red accent color for our black interior 2013 CRV.  Fits well - a bit of a tug to get it on, but it stays in place.  Husband loves it.  Very happy with it!
B000WJYZFA|5|Best price I could find. Free prime shipping, 2 days...absolutely great deal.  Have had no issues with battery.
B0070Y35GU|1|to release the cut tint is a pain and it broke no matter how gentle I pull.
B00496V7PI|5|I upgraded our 2005 Buick LeSabre Custom's battery to a heavy duty 12&#34; battery.  The vent tube for the original battery (10&#34;) would not fit.  You could only attach it to one of the battery vents on the end of the battery, but not the vent at the other end.  This GM Original battery vent tube fit perfectly and was much cheaper than at the dealer.  Simple, 10 minute installation.  Couldn't be happier!
B005N9EKUY|1|Extremely cheap and flimsy, doesn't stay attached to anything, top doesn't stay on.
B000K3EV0W|5|This was a great gift!
B000CHMLIK|2|Bought in March 2015, lasted until August 2015 when it would no longer seal.  It clicks but doesn't tighten; it flops around in the slot loose. 2 stars because for a few bucks, at least it made the check engine light turn off so that my 2005 Scion tC could pass smog!
B000C1QOGQ|4|It worked out great!  Also, half the price of anywhere else
B0049IACSO|4|Works well for me. I carry my Yamaha TW200 on the back of my pickup/camper while traveling. The &#34;hitch wobble stabilizer&#34; isn't all that great. Had to grind an angle on my receiver hitch to make it work. That's the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.
B006QZEX9M|4|I bought this for a 2012 KX65. So far so good no problems
B000WJA5ZY|5|Ram mounts are the bomb!
B004NYJPXW|4|For the size the light out is surprisingly well. Only CON is my four-way flasher indicator still lights up when the driving lights are on.... was hoping that the 3-wire setup would have eliminated that.
B00B8KJ40S|5|GREAT TIRES
B0002NIK66|5|Awesome

B00WAMP72W|5|Very complete
B003AYUXGE|5|works good heavy duty
B003LFMCQG|5|I've had this cover for several months now. I am still happy with my purchase. I haven't taken it off since I installed it. Great for traveling. Better fuel mileage. It has a clean, low profile that looks really nice on the truck. It does drip, but that hasn't been an issue yet with anything I have in the back. I don't have to worry about someone stealing a cooler, fishing gear, straps, etc while I run into a store. Nobody is using my bed as a trash can when I'm in a parking lot.
B002GTKAHQ|4|Great!!
B009IFIADM|5|Considering that the mirror was not the exact quality as the original vehicle's mirror but the price was great and save me money. The instructions were clear and easy to read that it made installing very easy. I will recommend this to others when needed. Great job! Thanks Amazon!
B00R0AXOWE|3|I  purchased a similar one from the military exchange during the spring. These are larger but the magnets are not that strong. I will still use them because I already have some extra magnets.
B000EQPBH2|5|WORKS WELL
B00387ZSXG|5|Very ok
B00JYMZ8HK|5|Works great
B00VARODVY|5|These my be Pricey but its worth  it,<br />They Also came 5 hours early :)<br />Just the best Stands out there....

B00EA0ZB7I|5|Great light for the money.  Installed on lawn mower and they are almost too bright
B00JW1WU1A|5|Product is working as expected. Fits perfectly to my vehicle. Thanks for the OEM product.
B006NIDQ9K|5|I love my bling license plates.  The stones are big and shiny and it's just what I was looking for.  Perfect!
B00IMVNKOM|1|awkward place to mount the hose, making it hard to hold the nozzle
B00JJZ3T7S|5|Love them
B001IG5MOY|4|These are great----unless they lose their tension, which you'll notice after a few uses. I that case, they won't roll all the way back in. Contact Amazon and they'll replace it quickly.<br /><br />These are great if you have a pickup or car with a roof rack. I also used them to haul up heavy timbers in a house I'm building. so, great, except for the one in en that doesn't retract all the way.
B000NW4PJC|5|The part functions as expected with no PCM codes. I added a bit more anti seize to supplement the tiny bit already on it.
B00CD6FL6M|5|Great product and a great buy. Vendor was very customer oriented.
B004D3CD2S|4|Very good product
B0096S9GZW|1|I tried the instructions 4 times and they did not work
B00P5YOU3O|4|When placed in hubcap it looks good. You can't tell the difference. Not sure how long they will stay on.
B0064GVTYA|5|Item as described.  Thanks!
B00JNL6BFU|1|you cant tell by the pic, but they are not enclosed on the ends, not what I wanted and It cost me almost as much to return them, that I had to eat it
B00H9S71LW|5|I struggled for months with the cheap $20 ELM USB adapters bought online.  I have an Android Kitkat stereo head unit (Newsmy NU5002) in my truck (2004 Tundra) and DashCommand would constantly drop out, especially when starting recording on a USB webcam in android.<br /><br />I finally bit the bullet and bought the top dog model (OBDLink LX), and am so happy I did.  Not only does the connection never drop, it connects within DashCommand seamlessly if I shut the car off for a few minutes and restart the engine.  Seems like a high enough data refresh rate, there is no lag in response or data.<br /><br />If you are struggling trying to get Dashcommand or any other OBDII app working with a another adapter correctly, just get the OBDLink LX and be done with it.  You will be glad you did.  If anyone wants 2 free cheap as heck ELM327 adapters you can have them for free.
B00ZVJ2V3O|5|I just got these last week and am installing today.  I was actually surprised at the quality of them!  I was expecting them to be much flimsier considering the price.  I will be using them to transport dogs so I usually by the cheaper ones since no matter what they get abused and destroyed over the long run.  Anyways, I love the style and I purchased here because of price and because of the color and style being exactly what I wanted and I could find anything this style or price anywhere else.  I also had a fantastic experience with the customer service department today.  They were very speedy with getting back to me, and were able to help me with my situation above and beyond what I expected them to do and what was needed.  Thank you Car Accessories!  I look forward to enjoying your product.
B00ZQ34HT6|5|Perfect fit, great product!
B00SSD3K4O|5|Great product, fast shipping!!!
B000C9MLYW|5|Very well made for installation at drive shaft connection to rear axle. Ball joint press is best tool for R/R.
B000BYGD4W|5|Truck starts like a charm. AC DELCO fixed my problem.
B00686JBKU|5|It gets hot, but thats the only con this thing has.<br />Shifting is much more easier and efficient<br />Love driving my 07 Si FG2 with this on the stick :D
B001EP292C|5|Great item.
B00DDOSSLS|5|great upgrade to our camper. greatly extended how long our batteries last, less heat, and look great.
B00BZVYM98|5|Recomend this for all that need a replacement fob.
B000C5G43A|5|Fit exactly as expected.
B000C2PHMM|5|exactly what I needed -- fast shipping
B006590ADM|5|GREAT PRODUCT. KEEPS MY CORVETTES BATTERY CHARGED
B00RD56Y96|3|It's works and looks well, I just thought it was an order for 9 rings not 1, I wanted to give my daughter a choice of colors. Next time I'll read the description more carefully
B004FRY7J4|4|Fits well on my scooter helmet. Blocks the wind from my eyes while letting me get free flowing air to my mouth and nose.  Not too dark.  A little hard to get glasses on under the visor without undoing the neck strap on the helmetl…glad to have it.
B002OW5J44|4|Installation instructions were included and they were most helpful.  We got this because of the smoke color and we wanted to get light through our vent.  If they made the new taller one in 'smoke' I would have gotten that one.  This one only lets us open our Fan-Tastic Fan vent cap about 2/3 of the way.  But it's still a good product, works well, doesn't let bugs in and you can keep your camper vent open even in Florida's rainy season and it keeps the water out.
B007TYF4ZG|5|Great fit and an even better price!  Looks just like the original equipment!
B000VKODI4|5|👍
B00B6JY2IA|5|Worked great
B00YDUXYRE|5|theyre clean and nice no plastic. better than the originals and got them fast.....
B002VF2CSA|5|This one fits perfectly on my 2003 Lexus ES300. It's been a week and no problem. After seeing how to on YouTube, I was encourlaged to do it by myself. If I can do it , you can do it.
B001EEC45A|5|Outstanding fit, construction and appearance. Better looking than the original '03 Element seat covers.
B002JH3SPG|5|It fits perfect for my G37
B003BZO05C|4|I used to protect underside of carbon bike frame. Easy to apply and effective.
B00PNJIO8S|3|I used these on a different application(farm equipment) = needed lights to show when a 12 VDC circuit was active. Some of the threaded hollow studs are loose inside their black plastic housings, but some are tight. I assume they forget to glue them in place, on the loose ones. All lights seems to work fine, but I wish, for my application, that the wire size was a little larger, although it isn't necessary for the small amount of current that these lights use, just would have made my connections easier. I just got these installed yesterday (12 total), so they haven't been tested, for vibration, out in the field; but I assume if they can handle motorcycle bumps, they can handle this farm equipment at 5-20 MPH.
B001BDPG7C|5|great thanks  used before better price on amazon  thanks
B0042PCD4A|5|The right parts,and fast delivery !
B00O7ONGQU|4|Great product with one downfall: covers up the registration tags a bit too much. Needs less material on the bottom of the cover. Po-po made me remove it from my car.
B005JPJF7U|5|Like the Flex buffer, great quality.
B00KY35G1Q|5|fit perfectly
B0002V9LAW|4|It brought back a shine and luster to my boats finish, that I thought needed a paint job. This product works great.
B005GXQDHU|5|Bought at a used price it is fine.  No parts to be missing like a lot of my used purchases.
B003TPF0N0|3|I use these with an enzymatic deodorizer, Pure Ayre, which is basically a sort of scented dilute vinegar. Sadly it destroys them in about a year, which makes buying it in bulk less convenient than I'd hoped.
B002R0QZ32|5|A-1 perfect fit 1995 GMC 1500
B00QF1I3AM|4|They fit perfectly (I wear a 13 US and got a 48 EURO) and they were very comfortable. Really good price for what you get. The problem I had was feeling the controls. It's almost as if the sole and toe box were too thick. I kept skipping gears. Amazingly high quality but they just weren't for me so I returned them for something more simple.
B0058FEXNW|5|Fits great on a 07' ZX6r
B0039OZZ9K|5|Towed '03 Jeep from Cheyenne, WY to Moab, UT with no issues. Towed well. Was a little worried with the &#34;play&#34; but after towing around the block for a test run any worries I had went away.
B00O83XUTI|4|The revers light not strong as the original one , the revers screen not clear because of that other than that its good
B000X3EWF8|5|Great
B003SG431U|1|It said it would fit my car, but it didn't so now I have to return it.
B00B29BUC0|5|Fantastic
B002TTOI08|5|I rode my dual sport bike from Florida to Maine and back, mostly on dirt roads and trails, with this gas pack mounted on my top box.  It never leaked or came off of the mount.  Quality item.<br /><br />If you're going on a long adventure ride, you'll need extra gas.  You might drop the bike and spill some fuel, you might get lost or take a detour, you might need to give some gas to someone less prepared than you who's stranded along the trail... you just never know.  Bring extra gas.  This extra gallon will get you ~40-60 miles, depending on your mpg, and that's a LOT of bike pushing...
B001FGTTF0|5|i called jeep to confirm fittment and they said all CVTs use the same filter and seal kit. I recently did a cvt service on my 2012 and it fit without issue. About 2,000 miles since service and no leaks.
B004N1H8NY|5|good price,thanks!
B000CMJ2KU|4|I feel a little indifferent about this lug wrench. It works very well for tightening and breaking lugnuts free. But once the lugnuts are loose this tool is less than ideal for quickly spinning them off. I'm pretty accustomed to using a 4-way lug wrench and being able to spin the cross in my palm to quickly get the lugnuts off. This wrench requires a couple rotations to get the nut free and then you'll have to spin it off by hand. The shape and size of the wrench are great for breaking nuts free or torquing them down but it is not conducive for getting them off efficiently.<br /><br />However, the wrench is good quality and has a nice feel and works very well. The telescoping feature is really nice and it doesn't feel weak even when extended. You can really crank hard on it without much work. The length is great for getting good leverage on the nuts. There are two sockets included that are two-sided, for a total of four different socket sizes. They fit both SAE and metric sizes, kind of a &#34;close enough&#34; fit between certain measurements. I had no problem installing or removing SAE and metric nuts. There's also a vinyl carrying bag for the tool so you can throw it all in a toolbox or trunk and keep your sockets and wrench together.<br /><br />Overall, it's a really good wrench for tightening down and breaking free lugnuts, but I'd prefer a 4-way crossbar lug wrench just for the ease of spinning them off in a hurry.
B0075EANFG|5|Works well on my 1971 CB350
B00KCQSOAA|5|its really nice and I love the look .
B00VJ4LHUS|5|Great bag! I love it! Excellent quality, great price, just as advertised -- actually, better! I highly recommend it.
B00PZ6DBUU|5|It arrived quickly and was exactly as advertized. Its been mounted on the front bumper for weeks and has held up great. A big hit with my fellow misplaced Texans here in Georgia.
B00FXH7LOI|5|Delivered on time and it was exactly like the pictures. Perfect!
B003YNJ1C8|5|worked great and easy to install
B001EAWOEK|2|UPDATE (3/20/2017): For the last couple of months, I've been getting a lot of static with my adapter... I've tried just about everything I could think of with a few more things to try... not sure why the static came from nowhere.  Hoping I can fix this to get back the great quality I had before... made my car a blast to play my own music with extremely high quality.  ORIGINAL: Installed into a 2003 Chevrolet Tahoe that had a 6 CD disk changer and Rear Seat Entertainment. The only way it'll work is if I have the RSE on, which means I have to reach my hand back and turn the RSE on everytime I get into the car. Kind of annoying but I can put up with it for finally getting quality sound from Bose speakers in my truck!
B008A5WN2U|5|Awesome customer service. Will do buisness with them again i am sure of it. Also has easy to follow instructions for installation of decals.
B000CMKELQ|4|High quality, fits as advertised.  Shipment was timely, delivered as promised...
B008N69C7U|4|I usually use [[ASIN:B0012TZ1RU Maxima Chain Wax]] on Kelly, my 2013 Triumph America, but when my local bike shop was out of it the clerk recommended Motul as an alternative.  My Triumph X-chain is (unnecessarily) temperamental, so I'm usually picky about what goes on it, but since I was already overdue to lube I gave it a go.<br /><br />Like Maxima, the Motul goes on white so it's easy to see where you've lubed, then dries clear(-ish).  The bottle comes with a targeted spigot for use directly on the chain, or a wide-angle if you had the chain off for lube.  It actually seemed to penetrate deeper than the Maxima, and lasts longer (with Maxima I spray every 100-120 miles, this goes about 200).  The down side is that it does not dry as clear or cleanly as the Maxima, so for making Kelly look her prettiest I'm still biased to the Maxima chain wax.<br /><br />If I can say one thing about us Triumph riders, we're particular.  It's rare that we'll switch brand loyalty on our bikes, but this Motul Chain Lube performs pretty well.
B000IZ4P3U|5|Installed last night. It works well and was easy to install.
B00UVXDIS2|4|LOve it! !
B0025POPYU|5|Good product
B0031I807I|4|good deal
B000IWGRUM|5|OEM quality at a fraction of the dealership price.
B00D8RYHHE|5|super bright love it..
B003CG9PIC|5|I love this snatch Block. the fact that it can be regreased is an added plus that I did not realized when I purchased it!!. It is strong and does the job perfectly. I have used this on 4 recoveries so far and it has not failed. Completely satisfied with my purchase
B001NI7KE2|5|It fit perfectly in the back of the car. It seems to be made very well. I would highly recommend this clothes bar.
B00HE919LE|5|These really save me a lot of time and money in my business.
B0012TWMCC|5|Great product.  Great price.  Great service.
B000CIJ308|5|Does the job as expected. Gives it a good shine.<br />SOmetimes need 2 coats.
B006X8BATI|5|Almost looks like it was factory equipment
B00LM555KM|5|These are the best car air fresheners ever!  They smell so good... great for dudes.  My wife calls this scent &#34;hot guy&#34;... highly recommended!
B00W4QP4GI|5|[[VIDEOID:8fb2ac9aabe47c2d68e74310a35bff4c]] I have done a before and after video and I encourage you to watch it to see the difference between the old halogen bulbs and the LED bulbs. I replaced all of my interior lights in my Tahoe in about an hour with these Newest, 10pcs ,W5w 194 168 2825 T10 Wedge 5-smd 5050 White High Power Car Lights Bulbs. These lights are very bright and very white. An amazing difference from the old yellow brown halogens.  IMPORTANT NOTE: These lights do have a positive and a negative so if it doesn't work just flip it around. All 10 of mine worked great. We also have these in our Malibu Path Lighting. They look amazing and draw so much less current. I can add more lights to my power pack without overdrawing it.<br /><br />IMPORTANT NOTE  When you are installing these make sure you have enough clearance between the end of the bulb and the lens..These are a tad bit longer than standard bulbs. Also like I said make sure you have them in right. If they are not working, flip them around. They do have a positive and a negative.<br /><br />Over all I am very satisfied with the end results of the Newest, 10pcs ,W5w 194 168 2825 T10 Wedge 5-smd 5050 White High Power Car Lights Bulbs. I will see how long they last now. Will update if there are any changes.<br /><br />If you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the comments. I will respond. If you found my review helpful, let me know. Lets keep making better buying decisions together. Thank you and as always Be Safe & Happy Shopping!!<br />I received a sample product to test and evaluate. If anything changes during my usage, I will update my review.
B000H0QQ5G|5|The bulbs work as expected. I would highly recommend these lightbulbs to anyone.
B00EF1LOFK|5|I have not used it yet so I cannot judge the item, I can only say I received it on time. Replaced the faulty switch and the problem was solved, I will keep this product for future use, it was the cheapest on the net.
B00QCQQU00|5|Fast shipping andnlow price for same quality
B004K2BH4W|3|pay close attention, the pics are deceiving. this is veryyyyy small. wouldnt even fit over my atv rope loop ends.
B00NFSNAS8|3|Did not meet my needs - It works ok - but I needed more air and quicker for inflation needs.
B00TJD0ZW2|5|Very quality item - well built and easy to install.  Nice long cable also - especially compared to the more expensive models.  Remember, this is a 220v charger and needs two breakers on your home panel.
B008Y8YCJ0|4|Quick easy way to lift the 4Runner.
B0013LF5VY|5|purchase as a gift
B005MZZF8A|5|Anyone who has been in combat will relate to this magnet.
B0019VZYN2|5|Delivered on schedule as promised.
B003IDAJ0W|1|Horrible
B001F85OUM|5|Easy install, works great.  I like that it has multiple modes.  I don't have to keep releasing and pulling the brake handle to keep the sequence going indefinitely at a stop.
B006QGD996|4|have not had a change to use, they look well made.
B00K6498D0|2|cable works just fine for my 01 Audi, but the software disc is useless-I tried it on 3 computers..... like there's nothing on the disc !!!!
B000CIR41I|5|Sounds as expected on my 12 Ram 1500 with the 5.7 HEMI, which is to say, really good!!  Great modern muscle car rumble, loud when you want it, quiet when you don't.  It's all in how you use the throttle, but even at idle it has that nice muscle car rumble.  Product felt high quality as it was &#34;heavy&#34; and the powder coating appeared thick, the welds looked good too.
B00WXI10II|1|Ordered wrong meter.  tried to return it and said I couldn't
B000VLF940|5|A summer essential!
B004C6Q46M|5|Pep Boys installed for $49 and it took them 2 hours!!!!!

B004A2BBOI|5|Factory Replacement, installed on my 2015 Ford F250
B000IYXJRO|5|Fit 2006 4 runner
B000E2682S|5|This controller is to replace my other one that was also a draw tite controller that was 18 years old and up until recently worked perfectly. That's why I bought another one from them. This controller installed easy and the set up is even easier. The brake controller works excellent with my 2 axle trailer it stops even better than the old one and a very reasonable price. Excellent product.
B004JN6TNG|5|These look Amazing on my 2010 Chevy Camaro..
B00QL17J42|5|Shipped fast, just as described.  Easy to install and good price!
B001LHVOVK|5|Thanks!

B00DVWH1HY|5|They look great on my car
B002N5W8Q4|4|My older version did not have an on/off switch.  I docked 1 star for the PIA task of removing the bottom cover to add or remove batteries.
B007K22FVS|5|LOOKS GREAT AND EASY TO REPLACE. NICE AND BRIGHT.
B000X21WRU|5|Love it. Fit perfectly and give the exact protection we wanted. Fussy husband can now relax and not worry about damage to the interior of the vehicle. Thanks.
B001C6OYQ2|5|ON TIME,RIGHT PART,DAMAGE FREE AND VERY GOOD PRICE.
B00KWMCITC|5|Sturdy and good mats received on time will buy again from this seller
B00DUS2D0Y|5|This kit replaced the aging intercooler boots and plastic pipe on my 6.0. It is a fantastic choice with a lifetime warranty even on the boots. The only issue at all is the post turbo pre intercooler boot and pipe is a bit long and allowed it to but up to the Air Conditoning suction line so as in my case you may need to fabricate a bracket to keep them from rubbing.<br /><br />The plusses are more power and a quieter engine along with no more boot blowing off the turbo.
B001RM9ZNS|3|ngk always makes really good stuff, but the coil wire does not fit my 1991 dodge dakota 2.5l 4 cylinder. got the model number off the ngk website so its not a amazon problem its a ngk problem. other wires are great.
B004CMDDOC|1|I was using to clean gas cooktops because people had suggested it as a good cleaner.  It did pretty well on the porcelain however, no help on the aluminum either pre-treated or after the stains were heated on.
B003ZNRIGS|5|These went straight in, pain free, and fit absolutely perfect. They added such an amazing new look to my vehicle, and the lights are far better on the highway than the stock lights for my car. The halo rings look wicked, and really add an aggressive look to the car. Highly recommended if you're looking for a set of aftermarket lights.
B00YQAYSWQ|5|Easy installation. Newest version of map. Very pleased.
B000E7SY0C|1|At first this seemed like a great rack for the price. But as I've started to use it more, it's become clear to me this thing is inflexible usage-wise and potentially catastrophic quality-wise.<br /><br />Here are some things I liked about it. One it had the stabilizer straps to keep things from swinging. Two, it has integrated security via a steel cable and lock. Three the support bars fold out quickly.<br /><br />Here is where the thing sucks. I've yet to be able to get anymore than 3 bikes on it. This largely is because two of the bikes I have are smaller (two 10 year old boys bikes). I've tried everything including bike bars and mounting bikes in different orders, but to no avail I've never been able to get all our bikes on this rack. I'm sure if you had 4 adult sized bikes with traditional frames (women's bikes need not apply), this would work fine enough, but as it is for myself and the need to support smaller bikes, this rack is useless in that regard.<br /><br />The bike lock seems like a good idea, but is weak in execution. The cable is rubber coated and seems great quality-wise. It is however fed down the main support tube through a hole that causes it to bind on the rubber coating making it a pain to have to feed in and out of the tube. At one point I thought it would be a good idea to just leave it out rather than feed it back in and out, but this lead to another realization and that is the quality of the lock on the end of the cable itself. Being that the cable is heavy, it tends to whip around the end as you interact with the cable. The lock has a plastic cover around it, and the very first time the cable whipped the lock into another surface (the back window of my mini-van) it busted the plastic cover into pieces. It didn't take much force to destroy the plastic cover either and I wasn't being negligent or careless. Had the lock survived at least the first moderate impact without issue, I would have at least learned the nature of the cable and interacted with it in a more intentionally careful manner, but it failed on incident one with no recourse for correction. I manged to use super glue to put it back together however, but I don't feel I should have had to as it should have been built more durable.<br /><br />Another issue with the lock is that the cable is simply too short. The only way it can reach it's locking point on the rack is if again you are using 4 adult sized bikes with traditional frames. If you have to route through the frames of bikes that don't follow this requirement, the cable is simply too short and you won't get it locked. Ultimately you can reason that you'd only need to worry about locking the outside most bike as it would prevent the others from being removed, but in the case where you have to use a bike bar, the bar could be removed from the bike and dropped down avoiding the need to slide off the end of the rack and thereby making it a prime theft target. Had the cable been made long enough to fit a more windy route through the bikes, you could have routed the cable even through the bikes that don't fit the picture perfect scenario.<br /><br />The tip out feature seems like a good idea, but it's execution leaves much to be desired. It requires that you first release a very tight tension pin hook, then sliding the pin itself out, thereby lifting the entire main tube up a few centimeters and then finally tipping back the rack. When it's tipped out it does allow the backend of my 2011 Sienna to open. However it's all very difficult to do. The hook on the pin has so much tension, only myself is capable of unhooking it. My wife cannot, which is a problem because she drives the van normally and can never take it with the rack on it as she would never be able to open the back of the van. Had the tension been slightly more reasonable, I wouldn't have to constantly mount/unmount the rack from the back of the van. After removing the pin that holds the tube in place, lifting up the tube to clear the locking position before it can be tipped can be difficult as it tends to bind within the lower portion of the frame. When it's time to tip it back upright, trying to get it to slide down into the locking position is even more difficult. If you can't get it slid down, you can't get the locking pin in and the rack isn't secure. It always tends to bind so that it's just short of alignment be a few milometers where the locking pin won't go back in. To get it to go down, you have to forcefully add your body weight while wiggling it back and force ever so slightly before it will drop the last bit to get the pin back in. It's no wonder I see in the other persons review with the pictures that show where the rack failed and let their bikes drop. That is the exact part of the rack that I question how well it will hold up when you have to so vehemently wrench of the rack to get it back together.<br /><br />Unfortunately I kept this rack hoping I could work through it's annoyances and in turn lost my opportunity to return it. So I'll be selling it locally, most likely for a loss and purchasing something else.he locking position before it can be tipped can be difficult as it tends to bind within the lower portion of the frame.

B00LOS5O44|5|Good product
B0016IMSB4|5|Save me 200 dollars no instructions. Had to rely on youtube. Learn the hard way i cut a live power line. TURN OFF THE BATTERY or your burn a circuit breaker.
B000NLX0WG|5|My husband installed this, and it works great!
B00RCEJ9PO|5|Nice good quality
B00B4RAS5K|5|it is on the back on my husband's pick up truck now! Love it!
B000E4IH70|4|what my car needed and fit well
B0007M308A|5|Works great.
B005U80TLC|5|Great not having to find a way to get a pad under my kickstand.
B003TPFF62|4|I use these on my short course pro buggy with 15&#34; rims and they work great. Only problem was I ordered this one and the one I got was not like the picture.  As a matter of fact it was not black at all.  It was entirely light grey like the back of it shows in the picture.  Which was a bummer because I really want a black one.  I just took some RIT dye and dyed it black which will have to do until this company comes out with a black one.
B00B9EWC4S|5|Great
B00DDY1M7U|5|worked great for my late 80's PW 50
B004QHEDW4|1|Light actually came on one time. Weak on/off switch stuck after one use in off position. Poor choice for my money! Would not recommend at all.
B00REQVA34|5|Works great! I installed this bulb on a 1988 Dresser. It does a great job of lighting up the road and the reduced current draw keeps all the other lights from dimming down at a stop.
B00M3876AO|5|Nice  I'll buy it again if I need it
B00GDIPNMS|5|My husband loves these.
B00J00X5YO|5|Great Oil and great price compared to my local Auto Parts store almost half price.  This is for a 2012 Honda Civic EX with the 1.8 and automatic.  With the MPG calculator I saw a 1mpg+ increase in mileage after the oil change.  I dont know if that was because of the type of oil or just that it was new but i liked the savings.  I used a K&N oil filter with it.<br /><br />Will be buying this way again for my next oil change.
B0051CAE1C|5|i bought several of these units and i use a samsung galaxy s5 with 5.1 lolipop.  works as it should..
B000CJFMQQ|5|Used it on my 84 Ranger 2.8L V6. The image is inaccurate though since this gasket is made out of cork/rubber, not just rubber.
B00MEVPQLG|4|It's pretty easy to greet a device like this with skepticism, I have been working on all manner of charging systems for over 40 years, and while it's true things have come a long, long way indeed, I never felt battery tech had changed where a cell this size could spin over an engine of any size for any length of time, especially if the battery were completely discharged.<br /><br />On the other hand, I have not yet had the chance to prove this supposition, and hopefully will never have to put it to a real test. But the last time my own battery was in need, it had just been losing a charge gradually from old age, and I have no doubt the Enko would have more than enough amps to get it going (a Toyota 2.4 L 4cyl) for that last run to the battery store.<br /><br />I did test it on my 12KV stationary generator, for which it seems ideal - cranked by a moderately sized home tractor battery of 375 CCA. I discharged it with a load bank to about 20% capacity, to where it barely could bump the 2 cylinder engine. I hooked up the Enko and following the amusingly polite Engrish instructions, and the little motor spun to life almost as enthusiastically as usual. The cables and clamps did get warm, I would not suggest exceeding the recommended 30-second run time. I can't speak about recovery and repeat performances, truth is I value this unit for its versatility in other applications to push it beyond limits. But I will make the jumper adapter a permanent resident in my onboard tool bay.<br /><br />The device calls for a 30 second run time, and probably a 10% duty cycle (though I did not find that spec) meaning you basically get one shot at it and then it has to cool, rest and recharge before another attempt.<br /><br />I am pretty confident in an average low compression bland vehicle it would be a great aid- assuming you had it charged and with you- but you probably shouldn't expect to be using it to fire up your Hemi-Cuda.<br /><br />Which brings us to another point- having it with you. Out of the case, and with only the cable I need, I may find it difficult to travel anywhere for any length of time without the Enko- it might not ever see service giving a jump start, but it does everything else better than any other auxiliary battery setup I have used to date.<br /><br />What You Get:<br /><br />You get the main event- a 12,000 mAh battery (also claiming a peak output of 400A) in a shiny black 6 X 3 X 1&#34; box.  Business is conducted along one side, a single switch activates it, a row of blue LED's indicates state of discharge. A USB out and a row of 3 charge ports, all the same size, but each for different purposes. This is handy for only needing one set of adapters and cable (also included) but can be confusing one is a 19V out, a 12V out, (measured) and one the 15V in charging port. I suppose it is protected from anything bad happening should you inadvertently connect the AC adapter to an output port, but I elected to not find out.<br /><br />My favorite component is the 4 headed Hydra cable, which takes you from a standard USB to a mini, micro USB, old and new style Apple iDevice connectors. And well built enough for power needs or data. Really handy- I tested it with the Enko and 3 devices simultaneously, it brought all of them to full in short order without cracking a sweat.Unfortunately, the old-style Apple plug stopped working shortly after the test.<br /><br />True to its name and design purpose you get a fairly well made but miniature set of car battery alligator clamps for jump starting, terminating through a fusible link to a 2 connector barrel plug. This connects to the battery through a removable rubber plug at one end of the Enko, definitely setting it apart from the rest. The size of the clamps and wire gauge- 10 or 12- are indicative of the kind of service you should not exceed.<br /><br />There is a generic but somewhat proprietary AC charger/adapter producing 15 v @ 1 amp; an adapter cord for connecting either of the other ports, (19 and 12V) to any device you can think of  by way of a rack with 8 adapters of the most popular sizes (except one for an old laptop I have, naturally) There is also what used to be called a &#34;cigarette lighter&#34; plug-in adapter for auto use.<br /><br />And did I mention a  flashlight alongside of the jump start ports? Pretty clever really, clearly intended to put the light right on the main event. Also has the rapid flash mode, and an S.O.S pulse, a feature I have yet to use (and hope to keep it that way) but continue to consider it one of those things that exist simply because.. they can. Annoying when you have to go through more than 2 clicks to just turn a torch on or off.<br /><br />All the components work well together and come in a decent vinyl carrying case with elastic hold-downs for all the various bits.<br /><br />Reasonably priced for all you get, I find it's too handy to just leave in the trunk, but a little too bulky to carry it all around. But- up to the buyer. I think it's a great little package and I can't imagine that anyone who drives and uses any sort of battery that would not benefit from owning one.<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Disclaimer: The product described was provided in exchange for this review.popular sizes (except one for an old laptop I have, naturally) There is also what used to be called a &#34;cigarette lighter&#34; plug-in adapter for auto use.

B002I0GYZU|5|good
B0031IBSDG|5|Arived on time worked great, fixed check engine light.
B00GRDPMG6|5|right item for the price,work as described.
B0052XTSS0|5|We drove from Ca to Mn with these as part of our roof rack.  I found them easy to install and we had no issues driving.  They were the best value I could find.
B00LAHZFJI|5|Great replacement for the stock Toyota Tundra Rock Warrior wheels although slightly longer than the stock bolt.  Time will tell how they hold up, though my truck doesn't see much use and no salt on the roads here in TX, so I'm sure they will last the life of the wheels.  Only downside is that these lug nuts do not have the captured conical washer.
B007PVIARW|5|I'm glad I bought this piece. It even has the pockets formed and fits perfectly/ Easy to clean and the groceries don't slide.
B00KCXMCTM|5|This tool kit saved us so much time, effort, and headaches when working on our vehicles.  My husband originally had me order this to do some customization work on his cars.  I have since used them to do repairs on my older vehicle as well.  Three cars, three different projects and zero swearing thanks to how easy and effortlessly these helped remove the various trim types from the interior and exterior of the vehicles.
B00EKNB2Z0|4|Very satisfied with my order...and the timing was perfect!!! Product was correct!!! No problems at all!!!  Recommend them to everyone!!!
B00BE9F8FS|5|It is a sticker and it sticks!  Great quality sticker.  Bright colors!  I put it on my Yeti Cooler and mounts beautifully.
B00AYA3Q0M|4|These floor mats are awesome. Just beware of the cleats on the bottom. They tore up my seat cover when I went to install the front floormats.
B00192KYLS|5|Very nice &#34;glasses.&#34;  They traveled well in my camper, and it was nice to not have to worry about them breaking.
B009AA2HDE|5|Good price and quick shipping. Took literally 10 minutes to install and fixed the service airbag light that's been on in my 2007 GMC Yukon.
B00LTU1QYO|5|Good
B00BSGJQ4Q|4|Quick and easy
B00G8WLX78|5|This adaptor allows me to operate my HAM Radio directly from the battery. The cigarette lighter socket inside the car has limited power and will not support the power needs of higher power mobile radios. This adaptor provides ready access to power for my radio in emergency or field operations.
B00JQ1S2TA|1|3 weeks later no item.  Update:  Finally got the thing, which promptly exploded at 60 psi.  Steer clear of this junk. Could be dangerous!  We really need a negative stars rating.
B0081S962G|5|Item arrived as indicated
B00L2X2KYI|5|I would give this 6 stars if I could. Took less than a minute to install looks great just like the picture
B000JFNAJE|5|This pump will exceed your expectations!
B0000AY69V|5|works great
B001LQLU2E|5|Great quality and looks sharp on vehicle.  Perfect!
B00493U6H6|1|Did not fit as was stated
B004APM12G|5|Great tool to keep in the garage or the car. Your tires are one of the most important parts of the car. Make sure they're in good shape! It's the main thing keeping you on the road.
B002P2YTIA|5|Work great
B00XVQFO42|5|Nice mirrors but they don't fit my Harley.ive case for my Samsung C6
B000GBBP20|5|Perfect fit and took only 10 minutes to install on my 2002 Tahoe.
B000A0EIM6|5|Fits perfect, and a great price!
B0063MI7UY|4|So far so good. Easy to install. I would have liked a little darker tint to them but they look nice on the red vehicle.
B008ETMV8I|4|I like these a lot, but wish the prices were better. These are a bit too thin/short for motorcycle use but should work in other cases.
B00DKCFU32|1|Worst product I ever bought.
B000O5KA6U|5|Fit perfectly
B00387ZQTW|5|No issues
B00G5INWMY|5|was able to easily program
B008KZD7UM|5|Works great
B00DP5J8M8|5|Really look sharp on my boat!
B00C3HNNCA|5|just as described
B008VOOBN4|5|I live in Cincinnati, where pigs have wings. We have the flying pig marathon and were called Porkopolis for awhile. So to figure out with tan sedan is mine, the pig with wings rocks it for me.  Came quickly, cute as the pic and adorning my antenna. My second purchase from this supplier. Great products.
B0031I20NI|5|Does what it needs to do. It's lightweight and has a small bag that you can fold and fit it back into. Comes with a small elastic lanyard with hook setup for securing to your bike as well.
B000FP8HUU|5|So far using it for chipped dishes, crockery and drinking glasses.  Works well to smooth out any potential sharp edges and danger while using the item (and not having to throw it away yet with just a chip).  Flexible and easy to use.
B004QHJ4VO|5|Fits nicely on my 2016 24' Winnebago Era 70X MB Sprinter. Just needed to take off the antennas before putting on the cover; not a problem though.
B00BYRN014|1|had to return
B003IOKPLO|5|Great product at a very competitive price.  Easy to use
B00AQ493WQ|5|perfect
B00JJQ8RBA|5|Arrived quickly. Gave instructions, very easy to apply. Looks great.
B004FFHJ14|5|It works very well, a perfect fit - I love it!
B00JZQXJ3K|5|Simple installation. Didn't have to drop the exhaust as others recomend. I was surprised to see that the wiring harnes even had the plugs to secure it to the frame
B0057O0GSA|1|Waste of money!  Choose this cloth as it stated it doesn't leave partials behind but it absolutely does!!
B006YHVXJU|5|30 - 45 minute install and good fit. I can hear the turbo better, and seem to have picked up a little power
B000GTTJAM|1|-0 or less because of the worthless Clamps,  why pay a  Premium price of  28 dollars for this thing I don't know
B00IT4HHLO|5|Very nice. Many positive comments. They make the truck bed much more useful.
B002Y20VXS|5|It looked exactly how I expected it to (I planned to put it on my gas tank cover and it fits exactly right). Shipped fast. No problems.
B00H2VVKHM|5|works great!
B000CAINEI|2|They are too wide for my Tacoma and they cost less at O'Reilly's. I am glad I had a couple of friends that could put them to good use.
B00KLKL3VE|5|Worked Great! Action is a little stiff but it works good.
B00T6J1RTY|5|Feels good lots of air flow.
B00YVHGTBM|5|love this adapter, had no issues with my mk6 sportwagen. works on every car i've scanned. this adapter with the app has saved me money from having to buy gauges and vagcom components.
B00DKDFVVC|4|WORKED WELL
B00CSX42WY|1|Would have given it less if I could. Turned yellow in two weeks as others stated. They did fit my 04 330xi however. And they must have appealed to somebody,  because mine were stolen off my car. So if you like yellow sticker emblems, by all means, buy these. Otherwise, spend the extra money for higher quality emblems. It's worth it. Hell, it's a  BMW, it deserves better.
B001D20X4W|4|Asian import product. No charcoal in these like the OEM that came out. But good enough for no odors and non-smokers.
B005N6XUIU|4|Smaller than i expected. Ordered the XL. Fits like a medium....possible large. But looks great!
B00AEBAF8W|5|These blade were a better quality that came on the vehicle. Easy to install.
B00FOFZHEK|3|even pressed up against my ear in a closed helmet... maybe I'm going deaf. the wires lasted for a couple of months too.
B007Y8540C|5|Came fast, fit and worked great.
B004TA6YXO|5|Works great
B001O0VP22|5|as advertised picture matches and are compatable
B005N6XHAG|5|Absolutely a beautiful shirt with great quality and comfort. I have a few HD shirts I've bought from amazon and all have been very good material and the price .... Amazing. I bought a large and fit is great. I weigh 140# bust 36C ....
B00E3BQRBI|5|Got two sets of these and both work well and look great ! Solid metal really improved the look of my bike !
B00XCOPJQG|5|I've only had these for a little while but they are terrific on my motorcycle.  I take a lot of long trips and try to maximize the mileage and used to check my tires at pretty much every fill-up.  These make life much easier.  Thanks
B00JRXL20I|2|If you love puzzles you will enjoy figuring out where each piece goes. They really should have included instructions where each piece should be located. There is nothing on the back of each piece indicating where to put it. Package came from China and the items look okay. I think it is a bit over priced and would not buy it again. Now to figure out where the 4 pieces I have left over go!
B00L7XBYI6|5|Easy to install, and they look great.
B00TG8C8PW|5|Great price, great product, thanks sooo much!
B008AFO850|4|Taking off one star because all the buttons are seperate from the housing.  It's a bit difficult to assemble.  But other than that it works great.  The fit is perfect.
B00KPXJVL6|5|A necessary step for optimal POR coating performance, works as advertised, tho I would advise if doing this in your garage, rinse the floor throroughly
B00418U0AM|5|So cute
B00BI4B7SG|3|The decal was much smaller than advertised and very flimsy. The smaller details ripped while trying to apply.
B00266Z8MQ|5|Great product
B00FP6ZE9G|5|Easy to install and looks great. Good bang for the buck!
B000CP86ZE|5|Very nice. good universal fit; put on 2015 subaru Impreza
B006ZSUOEI|5|Great buy and great fit.
B005FKRA3K|5|Quality Item! I would suggest to everyone to purchase. Item came when expected, and packaging was good.
B00GWXSK8S|4|Great value; needed to reuse some wiring from existing fog lights but again good value/fit!
B000N37CNW|3|Not made very well, bends really easy. Will work good on things like battery posts and etc.
B004VA3G9C|5|Oem quality, has held up for more than a dozen rides now. Salt and fresh water.
B0013FUF4C|5|Works great.
B00AO2INVW|5|This was a very good kit which had a perfect fit and finish.  I was so pleased with the product I have since purchased many more from the Company.
B00CZD7QOS|5|I am a professional detailer and I love Klasse All in One. There  are a lot of awesome products on the market these days, but I've found nothing that does as much as well as this magic juice!  It cleans as well as many compounds while leaving an amazing shine and silky feel to paint. It's also awesome at shining metal and chrome trim. It's  the number one go to choice I have in my arsenal!
B008YU5REM|5|Really like the look and that sound. Super easy to install. Removing the original muffler not so easy but I got the whole thing done in about an hour. Noticeable increase in power and torque. I don't know exactly but you can feel it for sure. And, again, that sound...
B006UH6BPU|5|received exactly as expected.
B00HQQXOPO|5|Easy to install and gives a nice white light instead of dull yellow factory bulbs put out.
B00JKK7CIO|5|Love these. They fit great, not too difficult to put in place (directions came with the covers), and they are keeping my seats nice and clean so far :) I haven't purchase the back seat ones  yet, and wish that I did. Will update in a few months about wear & tear.
B006BAQ6Y2|5|Works fine.
B00029X2NG|5|I have purchased many of these and they are high quality.
B00AAICNPW|4|Very good
B006M77HFG|5|WORK REAL GOOD LOVE IT
B00DT5HRBI|5|Awsome vest love the adjustments
B004J10HAY|5|excelent
B00UH9HZJS|5|This motion light is as described.  Works perfect so far, it has been installed for a week. The light is very bright.  The install was easy and since it is solar, it was much more convenient than needing to tap into a power source. Shipping and delivery were fast.  Happy with purchase would do again.
B0066S0CTE|2|After few weeks of using this part I have to change my opinion. It's worst rubber hose I've ever seen in my life. I had to replace it in the middle of the road with junk yard parts just to prevent coolant leak. Quality of this hose is lower than bottom of scale. 20 years old parts are performing 1000 times better than this hose after just few days of using (1st time I saw leak it was just few days after mounting this hose on car). On the picture you can see inside of hose. Braid should be invisible - it should be between rubber layers. This causes hard to diagnose coolant leak (coolant will not show when you perform pressure test, but after few days after it, because coolant slowly travels along braid fibers).  Part had a factory defect, but after mail conversation with URO Parts they checked that other hoses in warehouse were OK. Amazon refunded money, so maybe it was just bad luck...
B000E35W92|5|Great product, high quality.  Quality seems as good as or better than original.
B0026FCGBI|5|Item was exactly as advertised and arrived on the promised date.  Very satisfied.
B0013ERRSK|3|Use as second source of water.  Cat uses it regularly.
B005FW335C|4|does it come with screws ?
B003VGO8SK|5|Wonderful.  This is not a genuine Toyota product but I was unable to tell the difference between this and the real one.  Even the plastic injection molding lines were in the exact place.  I'm very happy with it.  Also - they may show different pictures (driver vs passenger side) but you can accurately determine which one will be shipped by locating the OEM Part Number on the page and Googling it.  What it returns (either driver or passenger) is the one you will get.
B000JFJM14|5|very good product. shipping was fast as well.
B000CMH4BY|5|excelent..it fits to my mustang 2010
B002BAYA76|5|great
B007RVR4Z4|5|Works great and was easy to install. It took me all of five minutes to exchange them with my old ones.
B00KZCALVQ|4|Very bright. Easy to install. Once you get it you need to take it apart and use some flowable silicon to properly seal it. The plastic front case barely had any on it. It would have fogged right away if I didn't fix it. Inexpensive light, super bright, all LEDS worked. You recommend once it is properly sealed.
B0041P8Y3U|4|looks great,.
B010MHV00O|4|This cup holder fits my 32 oz Hydro Flask perfectly. The piece of rubber included in purchase allows you to secure the holder more snugly, which guarantees it to fit in any size cup holder. The only downside is how much higher the bottle sits - so I tend to hit my bottle often when driving and moving my arm to resting position on middle console. However, if you own an awesome Hydro Flask and want to travel with it in your car, this is the best way to fit it to your cup holder.
B00DHUA4YW|5|Very easy installation... I love the single level adjustment I always hated the dual adjustment type because you had to adjust them 1 by 1.
B00G94R7CK|1|Not heat resistant...melted right away.
B000C5SF9G|5|I ordered this from amazon.  Was a bit skeptical but after reading the good reviews on line for this product and the bad review on the alternators that Oreilley's and Autozone sell, I gave it a shot.  Excellent product.  Highly recommended.  Great quality and works great.
B00BJ4EG56|4|This solved my transmission / AWD light issue. I did try to use the Dorman phone support for a question and left a message. They never got back to me.
B007RP4OLC|5|Just what we needed to keep the door from closing on our legs.
B007RYMT7O|5|Very nice pump. Clearly well made and good pressure and flow even at the bottom of the cycle. I used this to replace an older 2088 pump that worked great for 7 years then started to get jittery, got new pump head which wouldn't cycle (cistern too low), then a whole new pump that also wouldn't cycle (obviously the quality of product had diminished). The 4048 works great though, is quiet and cycles fast. I am using it with a 10g press. tank to run an off-grid house. I had a heat sink on the 2088, that fit on this one also, so that's a bonus (is recommended if pump is to be used steadily).<br /><br />It comes with the strainer and fittings (though I use a 10&#34; canister filter ahead of the pump (possibly one reason the 20788 lasted so well...).
B000GQA8DC|5|Parts are exactly as described
B00EJFH6YA|5|Looks great on hubby's truck  Works great. Very bright.
B00032KBEA|5|so far so good, have my license plate hooked onto the windshield with these bad boys.
B00RBML85Q|5|WORKS GREAT AND VERY EASY TO SWAP OUT !
B0017OALKM|5|works as it stated, only took two minutes to replace them.
B000BWE4RC|1|2 of these pumps have failed. The brass fitting comes loose and leaks fuel.
B004K9KETY|5|Lasts a long time, super shines vehicle only uses one cap per 5 gallons
B00NWF6A7M|5|Operates perfect!
B000E3DT42|3|be careful tighten to tight it will break the plastic pieces
B00BNIOH84|5|I just purchased a new Ohio Ezpass (2015).  It fit perfectly.  I did have to remove the tabs that stick to the windshield to get it to stick.  I'm not a daily user so it will stay in the glove box most of the time.
B00BD4SKXG|5|they are excellent material (very soft) but fit a little loose.
B00CXBB8YG|5|We are thrilled with this little grill.  As part-time RVers, we wanted a grill that could be easily portable (fairly light and easy to stow), easy to clean, and that could get up to enough temperature to cook lunch before it's time for dinner.  The American-made quality is very evident, and I was pleased that it showed up fully assembled; the fit/finish is better than the China-made options.  We considered several other grills, including the Coleman line, before ordering this one sight unseen.  Don't be fooled by the size of the photo, it's not going to cook ALL that food at once, but it's easily big enough for six large burgers.  The extra little shelf/cutting board is also incredibly handy; buy that, too.  We bought the RV low-pressure control valve regulator, also, so we have flexibility using the RV gas or the little bottles, and switching the regulator from one to the other is a breeze.  After cooking the first time, a little Windex cleaned it right up, and it looks new again.  Love the stainless inside and out!<br /><br />Since we bought the storage bag, serving shelf and RV LP valve, it ended up being a little more expensive than some of the other options we considered, but I have no regrets.  The storage bag is a MUST, and is actually designed to hold and protect all the parts, including the serving shelf!!  It's like a piece of soft-sided luggage, as compared to the bags that come with the RV grills from the manufacturers.<br /><br />The only thing I need to alter is that the feet are slick on the top of my Camco folding table, and the grill wants to slide around.  I don't want to add anything to the leg itself, since it folds so nicely against the body of the grill.  I used a foam rubber dish mat first time out, and it's fine.  I'm going to buy a toolbox drawer liner and keep it in the storage bag, and we'll be all set!<br /><br />If you choose this one, hope you like it as much as we do!

B007D5F4VA|4|Not a pair as pictured and its a universal so you'll need to purchase the mount if you don't already have one. Found it cheaper to just buy the OEM bar for my application, but I'm keeping this one around for a spare since it does seem well made.
B00QREL2PA|5|Excellent.  Can't believe I waited so long to change my old rusty ones.
