B005VPSEK2|5.0|The only other Kelly Clarkson CD I own is her first one which, I must say, I bought because of one song: \\"Miss Independent.\\"  This CD was no exception.  I heard a clip of \\"Dark Side\\" online and I was hooked.  However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the rest of the album was just as good.  Kelly's voice soars from throaty rock to angelic melodies effortlessly.  This CD has rocked my Kia and kept me singing along ever since I unwrapped it and stuck it in my CD player.  Buy it, people.  Buy it now!

B0029NY9Y4|5.0|Based on Alan Moore's graphic novel, 2009's \\"Watchmen\\" takes place in an alternative 1985 where Nixon is serving his fifth term and costumed vigilantism is illegal. A former masked crimefighter named The Comedian is murdered, prompting his previous teammates to investigate the crime. Things get complicated as the backstories of most of the Watchmen are revealed and worldwide nuclear war looms.<br /><br />For some reason I was never interested in the Watchmen and therefore never read the graphic novel, even though I had the opportunity. Why? The fact that it took place in an alternative reality turned me off, as did the peculiarities of the team members, which Moore intended as satire, I later discovered. That said, this is mind-blowing. \\"Watchmen\\" is an adult-oriented superhero flick with a convoluted plot, strong characters and total originality. The latter two score high marks with me any day.<br /><br />Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) stands out with his gravelly voice and extreme right-wing ideology, although he's not very likable. He's impressive yet, at the same time, kind of pathetic. The character was based on Steve Ditko's The Question.<br /><br />The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) exudes great charisma and is reminiscent of The Punisher, if he were a jokester. Unfortunately, The Comedian's arrogant & hotheaded and has a weakness towards the ladies, not to mention cold-blooded murder.<br /><br />Night Owl (Patrick Wilson) is another strong character, obviously based on Batman or Blue Beetle. Unlike the previous two he's very likable. I always thought his costume looked really lame in the graphic novel but, as depicted in the film, it kicks axx.<br /><br />Dr. Manhattan (Greg Plitt), named for the Manhattan Project and based on Captain Atom with a dash of Mr. Fantastic, is an almost God-like being who can do pretty much anything. He's so detached from the human experience that he walks around totally nude and has no time for his woman, Silk Spectre II. He'd rather hang out on Mars -- literally!<br /><br />Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman) stands out due to her sexy costume more than anything else, not to mention Akerman's drop-dead-gorgeous looks. The character was based on Phantom Lady and Black Canary. Silk can't handle Dr. Manhattan's increasing aloofness and consequently diverts to Night Owl for human warmth.<br /><br />Silk Spectre (Carla Gugino) is Silk Spectre II's mother and has a pretty significant part. Like her daughter, she's hot, albeit in a whole different way.<br /><br />Ozzyosbourne, whoops, I mean Ozymandias (Matthew Goode) is the least developed character and loosely based on Charlton Comic's Thunderbolt. He's ultra-smart, ultra-quick and kinda foppish.<br /><br />Another highlight is the hypnotic score by Tyler Bates mixed with a quality soundtrack (e.g. \\"The Sound of Silence,\\" \\"All Along the Watchtower,\\" etc.)<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: The film is long, dark, mature, dialogue-driven and convoluted, but the strong characters and originality win the day. No moronic \\"blockbuster\\" trash here. Not to mention Silk Spectre II and her mother are extremely easy on the eyes. As far as superhero flicks go, there's really nothing else like \\"Watchmen.\\" It's even more atypical than the X-Men and easily one of my favorite superhero flicks, maybe even THE favorite. \\"Watchmen\\" is like the \\"Apocalypse Now\\" of superhero films!<br /><br />RUNTIME: Theatrical Cut: 162 minutes; [[ASIN:B0091XI9LE Watchmen (Director's Cut) [HD]]]: 186 minutes; [[ASIN:B0093ICOE0 Watchmen Collector's Edition: Ultimate Cut + Graphic Novel [Blu-ray]]]: 215 minutes<br /><br />COMPARING CUTS: I own both the theatrical cut and Director's Cut. Although the theatrical version is just fine, the DC is worthwhile for extended dialogue to existing scenes in the theatrical cut; the biggest addition is an attack on Night Owl's Mentor, Hollis Mason, at the hands of a thug gang and Night Owl's subsequent brutal revenge at a bar. Despite the convoluted plot, I had no problem following the story in the theatrical cut, even though I've never read the graphic novel. The filmmakers did an excellent job cutting out the fat in the theatrical version, so to speak. So don't think you'll need to purchase the DC to understand the story; it's not necessary. My recommendation is to check out the theatrical version first and only purchase the DC if the theatrical cut left you wanting even more, which is what it did for me. Even so, I PREFER the theatrical cut; it's leaner and just all-around better.<br /><br />GRADE: Anovel. The filmmakers did an excellent job cutting out the fat in the theatrical version, so to speak.

B006RUJST6|5.0|First, this is my first book review.  I enjoyed it so much I felt the need to go ahead and give it a review<br /><br />I skipped past this book about 20 times before I hesitantly decided to buy it, but it kept coming on my list of books recommended. So I finally decided to give it a shot and boy was I pleased.  Slammed is such a great book. I laughed, I cried, I fell in love.  If you have not bought this book yet DO IT NOW! You will not regret it, I promise. The second book to this is probably even better than the first :) I kind of wished this series didn't end!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|WOOL is simply amazing.  Each story builds off the last and pulls you deeper and deeper into life in the Silo.  Don't read any more reviews.  Don't risk spoiling the tremendous plot.  If you've found this book, if you've found this review, you're interested enough for me to tell you it is worth every penny and you will enjoy this book.  I've recommended it to my wife, best friend, and my parents.  I've encouraged non-kindle owners to buy a kindle just so they can read this book [though now I believe its available in print].  Ridley Scott has optioned this book to become movie, does a recommendation come any higher than that?<br /><br />Finally, Hugh has said he reads all of these reviews and I just wanted him to know Wool moved me like only a few books/movies ever have.  I can't wait for more and I can't wait for more fans to jump on board if for no other reason than selfishly wanting more people with which to discuss what will happen next.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|By the time I hit page 24, I had the feeling that I was reading Twilight all over again. Then I turned to my friends online and asked their opinion - and found out the book actually WAS Twilight fan fiction. She had vaguely changed details so she could publish it as her own story, but it's still obvious. You've got the same stupid, unattractive, obnoxiously clumsy main character narrating the book (and she never has ANYTHING interesting to say.). A tall, dark, muscled, handsome man brooding over her - and yet she absolutely has no interest in him. And then you've got the impossibly rich man that has achieved billionaire status by the age of 26 that decides out of all the women in the world, this vapid, blushing twit is the most interesting person he's ever met and he MUST have her.<br />I've never put a book down, no matter how bad it seems, because I always have hope that it would improve. But I couldn't make it to the third chapter with this garbage.
B007MDB71O|5.0|Truly a fun movie.  Brings back the old days of action movies with humor running beneath the plot.  A well made film but unfortunately Disney forgot to spend any  money advertising it.  The film does justice to his books and Burroughs would have most likely enjoyed it.  He created a world of fiction but one wonders if it was just his imagination or did he have some special knowledge about the history of the red planet?  In any case this is a film worth watching.
0345803485|5.0|I asked myself in the first chapter or so \\"what's all the hype about?\\", however by the time I reached the middle of the book, I was hooked. Late nights, early mornings, lunchtime, dinnertime, anytime, the storyline intertwined with my daily thoughts. In meetings my mind wandered at the terms used by participants, terms like \\"sub and master contracts\\". =)<br /><br />I sped immediately into the second book, didn't even finish the final thought in the final sentence of the final chapter. I must say, that I quite enjoyed the roller coaster of descriptive excitement, emotional torment and the comedic tone in the writer's style.<br /><br />Great purchase..

B000000OQ5|3.0|Tesla's first album was high on energy and enthusiasm as one would expect a young hungry rock band freshly signed to a major label would be, but what made them stand out was the electrified manner in which they transmitted that energy through fantastic performances in powerful, engaging songwriting. Unjustly lumped in with the glam-metal scene of the mid-to-late 1980s, Tesla merged the sound of classic bluesy hard rock of Led Zeppelin and blue-collar toughness of Bad Company with the heavy metal punch of early Def Leppard, and tendencies toward progressive rock revealed in the Queen-like piano-led drama of \\"Changes\\" and the bizarre alien nightmare of \\"Before My Eyes\\".<br /><br />Mechanical Resonance displays a broad range of song-styles, but the common denominator is a mainstream style of rock songwriting, some of which, like \\"Rock Me To the Top\\" and \\"Cumin' Atcha Live\\" are Van Halen-style stadium blazers reveling in the clichés of the style. However, songs like the aforementioned \\"Changes\\" and \\"Before My Eyes\\", along with the semi-ballad \\"We're No Good Together\\" and the defiant anthem of independence \\"2 Late 4 Love\\" (despite its goofy title) show a level of sophistication and creativity surprising to those whose only acquaintance with the band is with their radio hits.<br /><br />Tommy Skeoch and Frank Hannon, a criminally underrated guitar tandem, demonstrate impressive versatility in expert blues guitar and heavy metal shredding, balancing soulful and scorching solos, and ever ready to turn out a mean riff, particularly in the take-no-prisoners ass-kicker \\"Modern Day Cowboy\\". The gritty voice of Jeff Keith brings Steven Tyler swagger and Joe Elliot down-to-earth melodic flair with a genuine character of expression that was always at odds with the excess and pomp of the glam-metal style with which Tesla are often associated.<br /><br />With a solid and diverse rhythm section of bassist Brain Wheat and hard-hitting yet inventive drummer Troy Luccketta, Tesla packa forceful impact of pure hard rock power, yet it is the expansive range and depth showcased in their less mainstream-oriented tunes, as well as their unpretentious image and expression, that distinguishes them from their pop-metal contemporaries. Though following albums would refine and further expand their approach, Mechanical Resonance contains some of Tesla's career highlights, specifically \\"Modern Day Cowboy\\" and \\"Changes\\", and despite a few outdated 1980s rock clichés, is still one of the more enjoyable hard rock albums from the era.

B0085Z8F4A|2.0|MOVIE REVIEW #37: \\" Prometheus \\"<br /><br />Director and Producer Ridley Scott (Gladiator, Blade Runner) is back and unfortunately (or apparently) he didn't read this script very closely. I am a big fan of ALL of Ridley Scott's projects and even his weakest films (1942, Kingdom of Heaven) have had something of value in them in regards either their characters or story - but Prometheus - wow...I was a severe disappointment.<br /><br />Let me tell you what's good about it - It does have two really great performances by the creepy and mysterious Android David played amazingly and hauntingly by Michael Fassbinder (300, X-Men First Class) - and - the spaceships main scientist (Elizabeth Shaw) played by intensely and passionately by Noomi Rapace (Sherlock Holmes: Game of Shadows, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo). These were some of the most dramatic highlights/scenes of the film.<br /><br />The story written by first time writer John Spaihts and Damon Lindeloff -(Cowboys & Aliens, Lost) - takes a giant leap from the original Alien four films and is trying to be a prequel to the entire franchise. The story is full of holes, the logistics of some of the action had the audience rolling their eyes in `you gotta be kidding' style. The theatrical trailer made me excited and eager to see this film - coupled with the fact it was directed by the `former' master of modern-day suspense Ridley Scott.  I was so disappointed. Yes it has Aliens - different in style, face-huggers that now look like octopuses and the incubation process is completely different - involving worms in the eyeballs! Need I say more?<br /><br />The Prometheus crew is assigned on a two-year long term mission to investigate a serious of pictographs found in various Earth cultures over centuries of time which leads them to the race of super tall beings (great CG effects here) that actually `seeded' Earth millennium's ago. Turns out - they - made a mistake - we don't know why - but apparently they create a biological weapon (i.e. the Aliens) to destroy their mistakes all over the universe - apparently.<br /><br />The special effects, the score by Marc Steitenfeld  (Gladiator, Black Hawk Down) and the cinematography by Dariusz Wolski (Pirates of the Caribbean, Sweeny Todd) are state-of-the-art, extremely realistic, very enchanting and incredibly imaginative. Using the production design that reminded my of the first two Alien films in a more cleaner and sleeker design. But this film lacked the story, realistic actions and the heart that the first two Alien films had and it was extremely unbelievable to me.<br /><br />Charlize Theron as the daughter of the mission financier (Snow White and the Huntsmen, Monster), Idris Elba as the Captain of the Prometheus (Thor, 28 Weeks Later) and a mission specialist Logan Marshal-Green (Across the Universe, Devil) all gave some not-so-impressive performances that made me appreciate the Android David (Fassbinder) and the Chief Scientist Elizabeth Shaw (Rapace) that much more.<br /><br />I wish it was better. I was hoping it would have been better. But this is a direct to video/DVD or Netflix film. Not worth $12 to $16! Not a lot of substance. Just a lot of special effects!weapon (i.e. the Aliens) to destroy their mistakes all over the universe - apparently.<br /><br />The special effects, the score by Marc Steitenfeld  (Gladiator, Black Hawk Down) and the cinematography by Dariusz Wolski (Pirates of the Caribbean, Sweeny Todd) are state-of-the-art, extremely realistic, very enchanting and incredibly imaginative.

B004EPYZUS|4.0|I'm not a fan of Tom Cruise so I hesitated to see MISSION IMPOSSIBLE GHOST PROTOCOL. I waited for the DVD and now wish I had seen the film on the big screen for maximum visual pleasure. Once you look past the unbelievable plot, the movie is fun. The incredible action scenes are the main draw of this film. Agent Ethan Hunt (Ton Cruise) has to climb several storeys of the world's tallest building in Dubai and he has to do it from the outside. Incredible.<br /><br />One of my favorite actors Simon Pegg adds some comic relief as the technical expert who dreams of higher exploits. Jeremy Renner and Paula Patton complete the mission impossible team of 4. The fun of this film is the exotic locales and the spectacular action scenes. Although the film is short on plot, the action takes over. The Americans and the Russians are again at odds but the twist is neither side is the \\"bad\\" guy. A rogue band of international terrorists implicate the IMF team as perpetrators of a bombing in the Kremlin. It is up to Ethan Hunt and his team to save the world. Mission Impossible!
B005LAJ212|5.0|This show was one of the best things I've ever watched! Revenge was juicy and filled with drama and it made me wait anxiously for Wednesday at 10. I only had 1 problem with the show and here I am to rant about it (SPOILERS AHEAD)!!<br /><br />The finale:<br />Holy lord Jesus was the finale intense. I was so pumped that everything had built up to this. And they killed off tons of characters. WTF! Victoria Grayson is dead? NO!!! There is no way that she could be dead! She was what made the show so juicy with her witty snaps and such. Also, Charlotte killed herself. No way, I was so shocked. (The song \\"Seven Devils\\" by Florence and the Machine was SPECTACULAR for the finale) Also, Amanda Clarke (ya know, the fake bitchy one?) is pregnant, but I have serious doubts that it's Jack's. Ya know, she disappeared for that long time, maybe it could be anyone's. These things need to be cleared up and the new season needs to HURRY UP!! D:<
B005LAIGSC|2.0|Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds, as always, are great in the roles but SAFE HOUSE is lacking on so many other levels. Two great stars couldn't save this tedious and predictable story.<br /><br />Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington) is a former CIA agent who has been on the run for years. He mysteriously shows up in South Africa. He ends up in a Safe House run by young agent Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds). The house is attacked by a group of unknown origins. The story soon becomes one of escape. Frost escapes from Weston, Weston escapes from the police, they both outrun the thugs and so on. They are always running away and escaping from unclear threats.<br /><br />As is often the case in CIA stories, the good and bad guys are never clear and there is always a \\"leak\\" within the agency. No one can be trusted. No surprise when the truth begins to evolve.<br /><br />SAFE HOUSE was a disappointment on all levels. I watched MISSION IMPOSSIBLE GHOST PROTOCOL and was amazed at the final scenes in both films to wrap up the story are basically the same. It seems like there is just one general idea in these films and little originality.

It's phenomenal!!\\"  This series makes me want to pass out little brillo pads in the street with \\"Read Wool Now!\\" attached to it.  Ironic that a series that takes place in an underground, secluded environment has truly inspired me to reach out to others to share this amazing read.  Unfortunately, I don't have a brillo pad to share with you, but honestly...Read the Omnibus NOW!  Become a Woolie!

1609611543|3.0|I bought this book with high hopes that it had something new - that perhaps it described a theory that wheat is making people fat, and that avoiding wheat was a secret to weight loss.<br /><br />The author dives into the history of food production.  A certain variety of wheat provides modern farmers with the best yield, thus is almost ubiquitous today, but was rare centuries ago.  Why that's a nutritional problem isn't well supported - just the fact that it's different is intended to imply a reason for concern.  He also describes problems associated with Celiac disease, which is a disease associated with wheat allergy and has serious complications.  The author suggests that some people who don't suffer from Celiac disease still feel effects from wheat, but his supporting information is anecdotal.  There are no facts presented that wheat consumption causes any problems to those that don't suffer from wheat allergy, aside from the calories that are consumed.<br /><br />One fact that the author presents in a negative light is that 20% of the global caloric intake is from wheat.  But there is no reason that is indicative of a problem with wheat as a food source.  If 20% of caloric intake came from fruits and vegetables, it wouldn't make it bad.<br /><br />After reading the book, I've come to the conclusion that it is really a book that recommends reducing the consumption of carbs, particularly those with a high glycemic index, and that wheat is an ingredient in many of the carb-rich foods that we eat.  He suggests that some people are unaware they have a sensitivity to wheat, and for them, wheat avoidance would be beneficial.<br /><br />Three stars for it being a decent book on the benefits of a low-carb lifestyle, and an easy read.  I just think that the title oversells the book.  I believe the title of the book, specifically calling out wheat, is a marketing ploy to differentiate the book from other low-carb books in the market.

0743270754|5.0|To say I was flummoxed by the handful of one-star Amazon reviews of Ms. Goodwin's excellent book is a mild understatement. Over the years, I have read a couple dozen books about Lincoln and the Civil War and, without question, \\"Team of Rivals\\" is one of my favorites. Instead of focusing on the key battles, she takes great pains in showing the evolution of some of the major players in President Lincoln's cabinet. There are oodles of books out there explaining in minute detail every key battle if you yearn for such works. This is not one of those books. The reason President Obama and Secretary of State Clinton enjoyed \\"Team of Rivals\\" is very likely because it explains the conflicting, strong personalities surrounding Lincoln and how he was able to manipulate situations to his and the nation's advantage.<br /><br />The book starts off by following the lives of four main characters: Abraham Lincoln, William Seward, Salmon Chase and Edward Bates. The only odd aspect about this selection of people is the author's focus on Edward Bates. It was interesting to read about the man's life, but Mr. Bates didn't really hold a candle to Edwin Stanton when it came to historical impact. Eventually, Ms. Goodwin brings the Secretary of War more into the picture and relegates Mr. Bates into the background with other administrators such as Gideon Welles and Francis Blair. It's clear Ms. Goodwin is a huge admirer of President Lincoln and, apparently, less so of such people as the machiavellian Treasury Secretary Salmon Chase and the ineffective popinjay, General William McClellan. Personally, I don't blame her. I'm amazed Lincoln never kicked Chase's and McClellan's front teeth out. The President certainly had many opportunities and reasons to do so.<br /><br />\\"Team of Rivals\\" is a work about the machinations of power and not the bloody battles that caused over 600,000 deaths in the four-year war. Her writing style fits perfectly in bringing these historic individuals to life. Such episodes as Willie Lincoln's death and the assassination of President Lincoln and Secretary of State Seward truly moved me. Even today, President Lincoln still has his detractors, but they are a minor, misguided group. Our sixteenth president was one of our nation's greatest leaders. He was a humanitarian burdened with trying to keep a very fractured nation as one. His intelligence, intuitive judgment and nearly perfect political timing were truly remarkable. Ms. Goodwin has done an extraordinary job in bringing these people back to life. There were many a late night I couldn't put this sucker down. Simply outstanding.sodes as Willie Lincoln's death and the assassination of President Lincoln and Secretary of State Seward truly moved me.

1401234542|5.0|Some may say I'm overrating this book. I've read reviews elsewhere accusing the book of being too \\"safe\\" for five stars, and that it didn't progress the story. I disagree.<br /><br />This book is just tremendous, from open to close. It progresses the story, but it does so in a different way. Rather than another epic battle, Johns and Mahnke decide to slow things down a bit and reestablish the characters that make this whole series tick. Here we see Hal Jordan dealing with the unfortunate fallout of War of the Green Lanterns, while Sinestro deals with fallout of a different variety. These two sworn enemies are drawn together by events, and they have to work together, whether they like it or not.<br /><br />This story represents a long-overdue slowdown in Green Lantern. For the last five years, Hal and company have been \\"warring\\" non-stop -- against the Sinestro Corps, the Red Lanterns, Larfleeze, the Star Sapphires, the Black Lanterns and, finally, each other. Here we're allowed to take a breather and remember what makes Hal Jordan tick, what truly drives Sinestro (hint: it's not \\"I'M EVIL AND LIFE MUST BE DESTROYED!\\") and how the people that matter to both men deal with their current lots.<br /><br />This is a great continuation of the GL saga, with none of the baggage associated with other New 52 titles.

There are times where the subtitles leave out key phrases, even a few arias that have only one or two lines of subtitles for the entire aria (and even those seem randomly chosen).

The movie benefits from a good musical score, well known actors giving great performances, amazing CG effects, and a tried and true story that most people are familier with.<br /><br />**Plot Details/Some Spoilers Ahead**<br /><br />The film follows the classic tale of Snow White (Kristen Stewart) and how she was born to be the fairest of all the land.  Once Snow White's mother dies, her father marries Ravenna (Charlize Theron), who turns out to be an evil sorceress.  She quickly kills the King and overthrows the kingdom.  Snow White is then locked in a tower for many years.<br /><br />I personally thought that Charlize Theron did a superb job as Ravenna.  Ravenna is quite an evil character that you the viewer will hate.  You will not have one scrap of pity for her.  She is SO evil you can't help but want her defeated.  Theron's only flaw may be that she lays it on a little thick sometimes, she brings the crazy a little too hard.<br /><br />Well, before the Queen can cut out Snow White's heart and gain immortality forever, she escapes.  Enter the Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth aka \\"Thor\\"), who is forced to track down Snow White and return her to the clutchs of the Queen.  Along the way the Huntsman changes his mind and decides to aid Snow White.  Although this was obviously a side project for Hemsworth, he really does give it his best, he is a good actor.  Women alone will watch this movie just to see him.<br /><br />I would like to add that I am not a fan of Kristen Stewart, especially after all the 'Twilight' movies.  But, in this movie I REALLY enjoyed her performance.  I also thought she looked and assumed the role quite well.  I will concede that she is apparently a talented actress.  I will in the future be on the watch for her non-'Twilight' movies.<br /><br />The movie also delivers the 8 Dwarves to assist Snow White.  Yes, I said 8, but don't worry they fix that mistake pretty quickly...<br /><br />In the end Snow White and her companions after being hunted and chased the entire movie, rally an army and march on the evil Queen's castle.  The Queen is finally defeated, but only after quite a few people die.  The kingdom and the land are restored to harmony, and the darkness of the evil sorceress is lifted.<br /><br />--Summing Up--<br /><br />This film at times feels like 'Lord of The Rings' and 'Chronicles of Narnia' combined.  Not that this is bad thing.  It is never sappy, Snow White is never singing to birds or deer or anything like that.  As I previously stated the CG effects are AMAZING, with all sorts of unique animals and creatures brought to life.  I will also dare say that there could be a sequel...time will tell.  The only CONS this movie has is that it doesn't go into detail about a few things.  Why does the evil Ravenna have so much power?  Who does Snow White love, William or the Huntsman?  Who was the giant deer with the large wooden antlers?  What were the Dwarves names again?  And so on.  In the end this is all minor stuff.<br /><br />Overall this is a really good movie that men and women alike will enjoy.  So husbands and boyfriends take your women to this one.  Good luck having them not fantasize afterword about Chris Hemsworth...ot a fan of Kristen Stewart, especially after all the 'Twilight' movies.  But, in this movie I REALLY enjoyed her performance.

B005LAIHY0|3.0|----------------------------------------<br />Public service announcement before I begin review.  Toonami is back!!!  Airs on Saturday Midnight, well technically Sunday, from 12:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m., with an encore beginning at 3:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.  Tune in and support it.  Now on to my review.<br />----------------------------------------<br /><br />I have just finished viewing today 'Prometheus' and 'Snow White & The Huntsman', (see my review on the later as well).  I can honestly say viewing these 2 movies back to back, I preferred 'Snow White...'.  Let me also state that I am a hard-core Sci-Fi fan.  I am not easily confused by Science Fiction movies.  Not like my brother...come on is the time travel concept from 'Terminator' so complicated?  John Conner in the future sent his dad back in time to protect and i.e. father him, easy.  Why is this so confusing, yes John Conner is older than his father...in the future.  Well...I feel like my brother now after watching 'Prometheus', but I will give this review/analysis my best try.  Here it goes...<br /><br />--Casting Choices/Some of the Main Actors--<br /><br />Michael Fassbender as \\"David\\":  By far the most interesting character in the whole film.  David is of course an android in the manner that \\"Ash\\" and \\"Bishop\\" were androids in the other 'Alien' films.  Fassbender though takes a unique spin on being an artificial lifeform.  Every aspect of his performance makes him appear un-human.  The way he walks, his speach, the way he sits completely erect in a chair versus slumping down like we humans do.  David is also extremely intelligent, but is treated like a slave by the other humans.  They are practically calling him \\"boy\\" in the movie.  David of course is forced to serve, it's part of his programming.  Unlike other androids in the 'Alien' franchise, David does not go into hyper-sleep.  He maintains the ship, oversees the slumbering passengers and spends his free time learning dead lanuages and watching 'Lawrence of Arabia'.  By the way writers, cool move having David dye and style his hair after a young Peter O'toole.  I personally thought that was neat having him altering his appearance after an actor he loved watching.  Being alone for over 2 years though probably hasn't done David any good, solitude even for androids is bad...  I read that Fassbender modeled his performance after the replicant \\"Rachael\\" in 'Blade Runner' and the voice of Hal from '200l...', along with other inspirations.  This is clear in the movie as David starts to develope his own unique versions of emotions, which isn't good for us.  One thing, what's with the name \\"David\\" and Sci-Fi films?  David in '2001...', David in 'Independance Day', David Bowie in 'The Man Who Fell To Earth', David the android in 'A.I.', time for some new names writers...<br /><br />Guy Pearce as \\"Peter Weyland\\":  Pearce is the current Weyland in this film.  Apx 5 minutes of screen time is all he had, as an extremely old man.  Nothing memorable, nothing quite going into any depth about.  Just an old man desperate to escape death.<br /><br />Charlize Theron as \\"Meredith Vickers\\":  The woman with the power in this movie.  Theron's screen time is also not that much, apx 25 minutes total, which is probably why she is listed last on the opening credits...  Theron does not have many action sequences in the film, really she just stands around a lot.  I read tonight that she is a big smoker and this limited her action sequences in the film.  Limited them, ELIMINATED them more like it.  Acting wise she does not give the best performance in this film.  It ends up feeling like is was just a side project for her, a paycheck, nothing more.  Could be I'm also missing Sigourney Weaver.<br /><br />Noomi Rapace as \\"Elizabeth Shaw\\":  The Sigourney Weaver of this movie.  Rapace's on screen performance was paled by Fassbender's but still one of the best in the film.  A scientist out to unravel the secrets of our existence, she still chooses to wear her father's cross around her neck.  By far one of the strongest female characters I've seen in film, I mean come on the woman gives herself a C-Section.  I practically piss my pants when I hear my dentist rev up his his tooth drill, I doubt I could ever give MYSELF a surgery like she did.  The only thing I didn't like was that everything is going to hell and she doesn't leave.  I mean come on, if I was impregnated with an \\"octopus\\" and had to cut it out myself, I would be firing up the rockets asap and setting myself a course for anywhere but that place.<br /><br />There are other actors of course, but due to review size constraints on Amazon, coupled with the fact that most of the other actors give less than memorable performances I will stop here.<br /><br />***Plot Details/Analysis, Warning: Spoilers Ahead***<br /><br />The film begins with us the viewer seeing Earth in the past.  A large extraterrestrial space ship is leaving our planet.  A lone cloaked being is left behind.  After he removes his cloak we see he is fact humanoid.  He proceeds to open a device and drink a black fluid.  He then dies, dissentagrating and falling into the tidal pools below.  It's alluded to that he basically \\"unravels\\" and his DNA is left intact in the waters, serving as the base material for our evolution.  Okay...<br /><br />Jump forward to 2089, a team of archaeologists discover a cave with 35,000 year old (or older) cave paintings in it.  The paintings have ancient man pointing towards the heavens at a particular set of stars.  This alludes to ancient man having encounters with an alien race and maybe more...<br /><br />Flash forward another 4 years, 2093.  The ship Prometheus is heading toward an unknown destination with I believe 17 passengers.  The only awake \\"person\\" on board is David, an android created by the Weyland Corporation.  David oversees the ship and it's sleeping crew, rides his bicycle and shots basketball.  He also is in the process of learning all the ancient dead lanuages he can.  After 2 years of flight the vessel has reached it's destination and starts to automatically wake up the passengers.<br /><br />It is soon revealed in a crew meeting what the purpose of this trip is, to meet our makers, literally.  Dubbing this aliens \\"Engineers\\" the goal is to make contact and to ascertain the answers to our most burning questions about our existence.  Why are we here and all that...<br /><br />Not long after the crew has touched down and is embarking toward a structure on the planet's surface that is obviously not natural.  Once inside the crew starts to \\"map\\" the tunnel system.  It is uncovered that there is a dead \\"Engineer\\" in one of the tunnels, decapitated by a bulk head door coming down apx 2000 years ago.  This is also were the crew discovers a room filled with jars, jars that after the door is opened start to excrete a black ooze.  They also find the \\"Engineer's\\" head.  Without the crew noticing, earthworms start to come up out of the ground and swim around in this ooze.<br /><br />Out of nowhere a violent storm erupts outside and the crew is forced to evac back to the ship.  2 crew members are left behind though.  Once back on the ship Shaw realizes the \\"Engineer's\\" head is actually encased in a helmet.  After David removes the helmet our scientists see that the \\"Engineer's\\" are in fact VERY similar to us in appearance.  They try to reanimate his head, failing, and the head explodes.  After sampling some the head material Shaw is astounded that the DNA is an exact match to human DNA.<br /><br />Well...things start to go from bad to worse.  David cracks open the jar he has brought back with him and after getting a sample of the black ooze, purposely infects Charlie Holloway.  Shaw and Holloway have sex and Shaw is unknowingly impregnated with Holloway's mutated sperm.<br /><br />To sum up (I feel this review is becoming too long), Holloway mutates rapidly and is incinerated by Vickers.  Shaw is informed by David that she is pregnant.  After escaping the medical lab she gets into a surgery pod and gives herself an emergency C-Section.  What is removed is similar to an octopus and is not happy about being removed early.  Shaw escapes and traps the creature in the surgery pod.  It appears the worms mentioned earlier have mutated into a form of \\"face-hugger\\", complete with molecular acid for blood.  One of these \\"face-hugger's\\" successfully latchs onto one of the 2 crew members left behind during the evac.  The other crew member get's his helmet burned off with acid and falls into the black ooze, causing him to mutate and return to the ship and attack the crew.  He is finally killed, after killing at least 4 people.<br /><br />It is about this time that the film FINALLY starts to tie up some loose ends.  It is revealed that the elderly Peter Weyland is in fact on board in stasis.  He has been awakened and is preparing to embark toward the alien structure, in hopes these \\"makers\\" can save his life.  David has successfully found an \\"Engineer\\" alive and in a hyper-sleep chamber.  Vickers is revealed to be Weyland's daughter and she is strickly along to have proof when her father dies, so she can return home and become the new CEO of Weyland without any questions.  David admits to Shaw he infected Holloway with the mutating ooze.<br /><br />It is also this time in the movie that Captain Janek (Idris Elba) reveals what this place is.  This planet is a weapon testing facility.  The \\"Engineers\\" here are making biological weapons and this place is not their home planet, but just an outpost.<br /><br />David, Weyland and Shaw re-enter the structure and awaken the \\"Engineer\\".  David states that the bio-weapons on board were originally meant to be sent to Earth to exterminate us, at least until something went wrong killing all but one of the \\"Engineers\\".  The awakened \\"Engineer\\" has no interest in talking, rips off David's head and beats Weyland to death with it.  He then attempts to lauch the buried alien space craft and head to Earth with the lethel payload of black mutating ooze.  The Prometheus rams the alien space craft, wrecking it.  Everybody but Shaw dies.  David although decapitated is still functioning and warns Shaw that the \\"Engineer\\" is coming.  Shaw makes her way to the ejected lift-raft.  The \\"Engineer\\" forces his way inside desperately wanting to kill her.  Shaw realizes that the surgical pod is inside the lift raft and the aborted life-form has now grown to tremendous size.  She releases it and it attacks the \\"Engineer\\".  She escapes.  The aborted life-form turns out to be a giant \\"face-hugger\\" and quickly latches onto the \\"Engineer\\" and proceeds to impregnate him.  Shaw goes back and recovers David's head and body.  David reveals that there many ships buried throughout the planet and that he could if repaired pilot on of them and return Shaw and him to Earth.  Shaw says she has no plans of returning to Earth and instead wants to go where the \\"Engineers\\" come from, and confront them.<br /><br />Not long after, Shaw and David are shown flying another alien spacecraft off the planet, towards presumably the \\"Engineers\\" home planet.  We flash back to the life raft.  The \\"face-hugger\\" is dead.  The \\"Engineer's\\" body is ripped open and out comes a similar in appearance \\"Xenomorph\\" Alien.  It hisses and protudes it's jaws out of it's mouth...<br /><br />---Flaws With The Movie---<br /><br />I know that this review is approaching mammoth size.  If your still with me at this point, thank you.  I'll try to sum things up.<br /><br />This movie above all suffers from BAD WRITING.  Not much makes sense.  Here is a list off the top of my head of things that were not hashed out properly:<br /><br />1. Your telling me the only way an alien race could seed our planet with life is for<br />  one of their own to die?<br /><br />2. Why would the \\"Engineers\\" create us, than millions of years later want to kill<br />  us?<br /><br />3. What exactly was the plan to kill us?  Drop that black ooze on us and mutate us?<br /><br />4. Why did David purposely infect Holloway?  What did he gain by doing this?<br /><br />5. Okay, so there is a lot of these buried \\"Engineer\\" spacecraft throughout the<br />  planet, did they all suffer from breachs in containment?  Wouldn't some of them<br />  have been able to launch?<br /><br />6. If this is truly the same planet from 'Alien' and 'Aliens', wouldn't some of<br />  these buried ships have been found by some of the settlers or exploration teams?<br />  If this planet is capable of sustaining life, with the only bad condition being<br />  too much CO2 in the air, why were there terraformers in 'Aliens' transforming it?<br /><br />7. How does this all fit into the 'Alien' mythology?  The alien ship featured in<br />  'Prometheus' is supposedly I read not the same alien ship from 'Alien', so where<br />  did the Xenomorphs we are all familier with come from?  I'm assuming they were<br />  just another weapon being developed, on another ship perhaps?<br />  How did the \\"Predators\\" get a hold of them for hunting?<br /><br />Sadly the list goes on and on, and I'm out of road here.  Obviously the writers for this film had some grand scheme in mind, but failed to transmit it onto the screen.<br /><br />---In Conclusion---<br /><br />This Sci-Fi film tries to pass itself off as a horror/thriller, but fails.  I was never scared or anoxious once while watching it.  Poor writing kills this movie's flow and leaves you scratching your head as the end credits start to roll.  Fans of the 'Alien' franchise who go seeing this hoping for answers concerning the Xenomorphs will leave wanting.  There is no unifying elements in this film at all.  I know that the \\"Engineers\\" are responsible for the creation of Humans and the Xenomorphs, but the explanations stop there.  Is this worth seeing?  Only if your a die hard fan of Science Fiction, but go into this knowing that answers will not be awaiting you.  Also don't waste your money on 3-D, I watched this in 2-D and could see no elements that would have been enhanced by 3-D.<br /><br />In the end I'll probably end up buying this for my collection, I'm a completist.  But I will be waiting a LONG time for the price to drop.  This is no more than a 9.99 purchase.<br /><br />Well that's my review.  Sorry for the length, this film DEMANDED an in depth review.  Now if you'll excuse me I need to go ice my hands, their tired from typing...<br /><br />--References--<br /><br />1.

B00127RAJY|4.0|It has been years since I have purchased a workout video or even hit the gym!  I saw the 30 Day Shred and had put it in my Wishlist for awhile contemplating if I should go for it.  Then using my Amazon GiftCard I earned using Swagbucks.com, [...], I decided to get it since it would actually cost me next to nothing!!    I am so glad I did this!  I feel great and am looking better than ever!  The excerises themselves are killer!  The video features a person to demonstrate beginner moves and a person for those that are up for more of a challenge (all though the beginner gal is still difficult!)  For me doing just 1 level at a time became somewhat boring so I mixed it up!  At times I do Level 1 but add the handweights for more of a challenge. Or I do Level 3, then 2 the next day!  It has made it fun to mix it up, I even let my son pick which Level I should do that day!  Also, I make myself form the 90 degree angles and I push myself hard!! It helps remembering that it is only 20 minutes!!  or, I only have 1 more set of cardio, or strength, etc.  The way it is broken down makes it easy to create small goals for yourself in the 20 minutes you are getting your butt kicked!!  This video makes you sweat! and I am not a sweater!!    The reasons I did not give it 5 stars!!:  music doesn't go to the movements, several errors on the video (I won't point them out because I find them really distracting now!), one demonstrator 'cheats' too much for my liking when I'm trying to work as hard as I can and see the gal that is to challenge me cut corners turned me off a bit.    My results after 24 days so far are great!!  My arms and legs have toned up and are becoming ripped!  My abs are visible (top 4)!  I still have a little extra baby fat pouch but it is shrinking everyday, which makes me smile!  Everytime I look in the mirror I see a new muscle I didn't know I had!  My self esteem is increasing! I've even went clothes shopping since I started because ALL my clothes are too big now!!!    I would buy this again and am even contemplating buying another Jillian video!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Wow!!!  All I can say is that this is one of the best books I've ever read.  Reads a lot like The Name of the Wind.  Seriously one of the best books I've ever read.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It is an awesome book.The Author has done a fantastic job with the characters.The characters remind you of the cast from the Twilight Series but they are very unique in their own way.
B005LAIHY0|1.0|The basic premise was good - scientist think they've found our \\"creators,\\" but also find the creators believe they made a mistake in our creation.<br /><br />But the execution was seriously flawed.  Some action was simply unnecessary and formulaic (like dropping the head and the subsequent rescue from the storm or the deaths of the two explorers who decided to separate themselves from the group - they might as well have been extras on an \\"away mission\\" in the original Star Trek).  Much was just plain stupid, such as re-animating a 2,000+ year old decapited head with electrical stimulation - this was doubly stupid as it did nothing to advance the plot, just like the storm rescue - David's infection of one of the characters, putting everyone on the Prometheus, including his boss and creator Weyland, at risk (he appeared to rever him), and Shaw's operation, from which she seemed to recover waaaaay too quickly (I thought these Alien creatures were virtually impossible to remove?  Obviously not when you have an autodoc - nod to Larry Niven).  Then there was the simply unbelieveable - like setting down on the planet right where they needed to land, just by coincidence!  (Hint for the next director to tackle such a movie - explain that a probe went into orbit six months before the astronauts' arrival, and a planetary survey was transmitted to them before they got there.)  Common sense left completely when a late scene shows Shaw rappeling out of the creator ship.  Why didn't she just get out the way she went in?  If she did go in that way (the fact that her ATV was awaiting near her point of exit suggests that she did), how did she get up there?<br /><br />The list goes on.  Other commentators here have pointed out several other equally ridiculous plot devices, cliches, and similar problems.<br /><br />It would probably deserve 2 stars, but coming from Ridley Scott with such fanfare and expectation, it falls all the more mightily.  God, I hope he doesn't make a new \\"BladeRunner\\" movie.  I fear it may be as awful.  \\"John Carter\\" was actually a better movie (it was fantasy, at least), yet inexplicably, it was panned by the critics while \\"Prometheus\\" is getting decent reviews.  It was terrible!  Scott has directed a bomb here, and it deserves to tank (although it will probably make a mint).

B004J1DBJI|1.0|Just as a \\"let's see how this works,\\" I looked up an NFL lineup. The last data (in 2012) was for the team's lineup in 2008. Pretty useless and that seems to be the standard across the board. The data/updates petered out about then. If I wanted out of date information, I'd use an analog source, not a digital one.<br />It made me sad, because Wolfram Alpha is (or at least, used to be) completely awesome.

B0088RQ4X4|5.0|After all the negative press with its release I saw John Carter with a friend anyway. It blew us away and was totally worth the price of admission. I'm a sci-fi fan (not hardcore by any means) and John Carter has a good bit of history mixed with space.<br /><br />It *is* a popcorn movie, the character development is very flawed, and I have no idea how they managed to (mis)spend $250M but go into this without any expectations and you will be entertained.

0345803485|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a long time. E L James is a very creative writer. She makes you feel like your right there. I am now almost finished with the second of the trilogy Fifty Shades Darker and I even take it to work and read it on my breaks and my lunch. I hope she continues to write more because she is exceptional.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|When I listened to this CD, the first thing I noticed was that it SOUNDED like the Beach Boys.  It's unmistakable.  The second thing I noticed and appreciated was how this CD was MATURE.  There's an appropriate mix of nostalgia and melancholy for a group celebrating its 50th anniversary.  Which brings me to an appropriate comparison.  I'm going to compare this album to Paul McCartney's latest works.  The problem with Paul these days is that he hasn't seemed to mature or grow as a songwriter.  He's still trying to churn out the same type of pop that he built his career on.  Which leads me to believe that he doesn't really put himself into his lyrics / songs.<br /><br />This Beach Boys CD looks back fondly at good times and looks forward wistfully to a future that recognizes it's short.  It's perfectly OK for a 70 year old songwriter to acknowledge life will soon end.  That's what I expect from someone of that vintage. Brian and the Boys do such a good job of that on this CD.  The trademark harmonies are there.  Some songs are catchy (the title tune, especially).  Others are slightly sad, examining a life / career now almost done, namely the three song suite that closes out the CD.  It sounds like a coda for a CD and career.<br /><br />Who else from the '60's could do a CD like this? Certainly not McCartney or the Stones.  Definitely not the Who.  Just Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys.
B0059XTUVI|1.0|I love Meryl Streep and she certainly did a great job of a sorry script.  The Prime Minister deserved better than this horror.  Little \\"jump-cut\\" scenes.  First you see her with old age dementia and then you snap back to an earlier year.  Back and forth the entire movie. When I first heard of this movie I couldn't understand why it didn't win best movie Oscar.  Now I think they owe Meryl Streep for even getting in the list.  Meryl Streep and Margaret Thatcher are both better than this movie allowed them to be..... and it was depressing

B0070NSPCU|5.0|My experience with low-priced Kindle-format fantasy novels is that two-thirds of them are terribly written, and most of the rest are adequate for a little light reading.  Given that, I had low expectations when I picked Blood Song up.  I was more than pleasantly surprised, though: this is a serious fantasy novel, from a serious talent.  Buy it.
0811870413|5.0|Just to be fair, I have been baking bread at home with and without recipes for years, and have adopted bread making as one of my favorite hobbies, so I'm well versed on some of the more difficult techniques in this book. This bread book is beautiful from the beginning to the end. Not only is it a wonderful resource to make delicious bread, it's a well done book that would be a great coffee table book. I find myself reading this book for enjoyment in my evenings, often times when I'm not even baking bread.<br /><br />You do need to purchase or already have some bread making tools, and if you buy the book at a fair price, you could spend up to 3 or 4 times the amount of the book to acquire the needed items to make the bread properly. This isn't a problem, because once you make the bread you realize it's worth it!<br /><br />This book will teach you how to make delicious, rustic bread and will make the task seem rather enjoyable. At first some of the techniques aren't easy, even for a more advanced baker, but once you get the hang of it you will love what you're doing! I highly recommend this book, not only for the recipes but for the general aesthetics of the book.

B005LAIGNC|3.0|I'm going to address the Blu ray version of this film as I had not seen it in the theaters when it was released.  The best thing about the disc isn't the theatrical film itself but \\"Double Victory: The Tuskegee Airmen at War,\\"  the 1 hour documentary \\"extra.\\"  While the theatrical film addresses some of the history of the courageous Tuskegee airmen, the documentary focuses of the \\"second war\\" back in the United States.  Using excellent interviews with many of the survivors of the Red Tails and their African-American bomber crew confederates, many of the injustices they lived through are fleshed out.  They are supplemented by some remarkable film footage from the time.  These great Americans effectively launched the Civil Rights movement even before Jackie Robinson integrated baseball or Rosa Parks refused to give up her bus seat.<br /><br />The next best thing about this film is the aerial combat photography, some of which is done with real planes and real pilots and some is done with some amazing CGI and George Lucas's technicians.  I was especially taken with the introduction of some early German jet fighters as they engaged the Red Tails' P-51 Mustangs.  The other big positive is the magnificent transfer to Blu ray.  From the opening scenes the film sparkles in this Lucas authorized release.  The colors are bright and vivid.  The textures are finely tuned, especially in close ups.  The audio likewise is demo ready.  As you might expect, the audio is an important feature with planes shooting at each other all over the Italian and German skies.  In addition to the aforementioned documentary, other extras include comments by Lucas and director Anthony Hemingway, composer Terrance Blanchard and the cast.  There is also a 5 minute feature at how the CGI came into play.  The film and the extras are in 1080p with the film shown in a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The audio is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.<br /><br />Unfortunately the film itself isn't so good.  While the actors in key roles are fine, some of the secondary actors come off like bumpkins or amateurs.  Of course some of the cornball dialog they are given is equally bad.  In a few sequences when the Red Tails are escorting bombers flown by a white crew, the bomber pilots make some of the most ridiculous comments that I had to laugh.  I don't know if this was done intentionally or not but it comes across as just dumb.  There are also a couple scenes with the black pilots that slang terms and pronunciations are spoken that were not used in 1944.  What is important is that this story got visibility with this film.  It could have been better.y roles are fine, some of the secondary actors come off like bumpkins or amateurs.  Of course some of the cornball dialog they are given is equally bad.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|It's the little things as much as the obvious things. She is a current college graduate who has never had an email address. She's 22 and she wears her hair in pigtails. I'm more of a Romance novel reader than erotica, so I don't know if it's the norm to have about zero story line, but I need some sort of real life stuff between them talking about sex and having sex. The characters are poorly developed, unrealistic, and unlovable. I'm halfway through and I cannot go on.
B005LAIHE0|4.0|The characters are likable and real and their conflicts are authentic to real life.  Blunt, Segal, and the supporting cast (including Chris Pratt--Andy--from Parks and Rec and Alison Brie of Mad Men and Community) are really, really funny.  I felt as if were joking with me, not at a camera or an audience.  The movie is a mix of thoughtful commentary on relationships and people being silly, evoking a mood similar to that of movies like Juno and Bridesmaids.  While not quite as *hilarious* as Bridesmaids, it still has the same vibe in that we're able to watch a relationship play out on screen not unlike those we've seen around us (or been a part of) while intermittently laughing aloud to relieve the tension.  I highly recommend it :)

0307730697|5.0|As I opened the first pages of this book about the life of Adam Brown, my heart was not prepared for what I was about to read. God bless his family for wanting his story told. It is a story that holds honor, valor and one worth telling. It shows us the grace of God and His mercies that touch us every day. This is a personal story. A glimpse into the life of Adam Brown and those who loved and admired him. We see a portrait of a young American Hero.<br /><br />Adam Brown's story doesn't begin as a Navy Seal and it doesn't end there either. Eric Blehm takes us back to Adam's childhood, his teenage years, and those years he struggled. There is such a transparency here that gives us a full glimpse of the walk of a Christian on a journey. It seems Adam was ready for battle when he was born and in his death he was prepared for a new life. A life cut short by battle, but victory awaited him. Victory was around every corner for Adam. It seemed he faced a mountain with a strength that could only come from God.<br /><br />Eric Blehm was honored to write Adam's story and to recount the days of his life with family, friends, and his brothers. I found this story encouraging and was inspired by Adam to live strong and face each battle with no fear. This is a story that will touch the depths of your heart. I loved the photos shared of Adam, his family, friends and brothers in arms. That made this story even more real for me. Too many times we hear a story and we simply don't connect for one reason or another. But with the talented writing of Eric Blehm we not only hear the story of Adam, we get to know him. My favorite photo? There is one of Adam tossing his son in the air and it held such beauty for me. Such trust and love between a father and his son. Much like the bond between Adam and His Savior.<br /><br />In this story we not only see Adam face trials along his journey, we see him laugh and have fun. We see the boy behind the man's eyes. We see his tenderness and compassion for others. We see Christ using this young man as His vessel to do mighty works for God's kingdom. Adam's life speaks volumns of a life filled with faith. It seems he checked doubt at the door and made the daily choice to live life to it's fullest.<br /><br />We see if there were mountains to climb, Adam Brown, was determined to get there. I feel honored to take a glimpse into this young man's life. This is a story for every young man and woman to read. It's a story for every American to read. It's these stories that should be in our history books for young people to read and become empowered by as Americans. Adam Brown proudly fought for his country and overcame obstacle after obstacle running to that finish line.<br /><br />From the very first pages of this book to the very last I found myself fully absorbed by the life of Adam Brown and those surrounding his life. Such bravery. Such comrades and brotherhood. We see how his family was torn apart by struggles, but brought together through the immense healing and strength of God.<br /><br />This is a great testimony of faith. A story well written and one that I will not soon forget.<br /><br />This book was a gift from Water Brook Multnomah for it's review.or others.

B005LAIHXQ|4.0|Sir Ridley Scott is classified as a \\"visual director\\" Blade Runner's visual effects rivals Prometheus. Althought Blade Runner wasn't socially accepted during its early years...later on it becomes a 'cult following' to a classic ending up on multiple 'best of list'. It looks to me that Prometheus will eventually win over its nay-sayers of even the \\"Alien vs Predator\\" fan club as well. Prometheus basically stands on its own...a beginning of 'things to come' - hopefully...that's yet to be determined by \\"The Hollywood Universe\\". This movie appears to be a first chapter of a new series...the orgins of Alien or even Blade Runner itself (well, I don't think Weyland & Tyrell Corp. have anything to do with each other). The unanswered questions of man's existance will(fingers crossed)be challenged in the next film(s)- It's good to see a film without the unnecessary \\"loud effects\\" & cheesey lines...great things come in forms of accidents not generic unrecyclable...stuff.
B007SGM084|2.0|This trilogy, although explicitly graphic sexually, has an interesting story line that is relatively consistent throughout the trilogy.  The characters go through experiences that include resolving childhood traumas and how they affect them in their adult lives.  It is easy to read and follow the storyline.  However, I found it interesting that the main character had the role of a book editor and the editing on this book was less than expected.

B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Many people are saying that this movie has really nothing to do with the Alien franchise, but it is actually feels like a direct prequel to Alien. The audience finally knows information on the space jockeys and the space ships they fly. People will find anything to criticize this film. If those naysayers find one thing odd about it, they will say it's a horrible film. Pundits of this film are angered at all of the plot holes in this film, but in actuality it may not be a plot hole because if a sequel is made, those questions will be answered. This is a truly great film and ranks up with the original Alien movie. For me, it's the best movie of the year by far. Also, the 3D effects were the best I've seen since Avatar. I usually complain about 3D movies because the effects aren't all that great, but this film pulls it off extremely well. It's an edge of your seat thriller and you'll be mesmerized hours after seeing it, it won't leave your mind. So go out there and see it, you won't regret it.

030758836X|5.0|Gillian Flynn has outdone herself in a modern masterpiece of marital disharmony that strikes a shrill chord much like the very memorable \\"The War of the Roses\\". On their fifth anniversary, Amy Dunne disappears from her home in Missouri, her husband, Nick, dumbstruck to find their living room in shambles and no trace of his wife when he returns home. As the tale unfolds, detectives inevitably begin noting the inconsistencies in Nick's behavior and his account of recent events, naturally suspecting that Nick has killed his wife, a beautiful, sophisticated Manhattanite forced by circumstances- his lost job as a magazine writer, the financial mismanagement of her trust fund and the impending death of Nick's mother- to relocate to this remote residence, far from friends and family.<br /><br />Flynn's setup is flawless: a careless husband spending long hours at the bar he purchased with the dregs of Amy's trust fund and runs with his sister, Margo; a lonely wife doubting her spouse's continuing affections; a diary accounting Amy's growing fears for her safety as their fights escalate; a magical New York life turned into a hollow marriage in Missouri. While an ineffective Nick stumbles through the first days of cooperating with the police and making stupid, irrevocable mistakes, Amy's found diary reveals an entitled young woman spoiled by indulgent parents, writers who have made their fortune from a series of books based on their daughter, Amazing Amy. When Amy meets Nick, she has found the man of her dreams, embracing a modern attitude toward matrimony, visualizing them forever in love, unlike their other married friends.<br /><br />Time and circumstance erode that dream. The Amy who disappears on her anniversary is an unhappy wife with a husband who has lost interest in pleasing her. After countless interviews, searches for the missing body and the inevitable dead ends, the unavoidable occurs: Nick is formally accused of murdering his wife. Their story becomes yet another media event, a voracious public tracking the couple's marriage, a talk show maven ranting about Amy's fate and Nick's certain guilt, You Tube, internet chat sites, the whole circus atmosphere of yet another murdering husband. But while the country treats this story as a salacious murder mystery, Flynn reveals yet another layer of deceit, exposing her fully flawed adversaries in a psychological grudge match between a brilliant, furious Amy and an ineffective, emotionally-stunted Nick. In Flynn's Machiavellian masterpiece the stakes are increasingly raised, the defeats more ominous, a chilling intellectual skirmish of a classic love/hate relationship with a sociopathic twist. Unfortunately, in this scenario, thrilling though it is, even the winner is a loser.

B007IXWL2C|3.0|I enjoyed the book - not as much as the first 2 but was relieved to see the writer had come up with more adjectives than \\"clamber\\".  This was a love story and in that sense I very much enjoyed it.  The sex, however titillating, got boring and became a repeat of what I had read 3 pages before.  I felt the sex was very much a fairytale because women are just not that orgasmic in their early 20's but this is fiction so I can overlook that.  However the lame back story about Christian at the end was totally unnecessary and it should have been left out.  A good writer knows when to say enough.
B007N85ZXY|3.0|I have loved Neil Young's work since \\"Harvest\\" and my personal favorite, \\"Everybody Knows This is Nowhere.\\" I like his soft folky stuff, especially \\"Comes A Time.\\" I love his Crazy Horse stuff, including the tossed-off drunken classic \\"Tonight's the Night.\\"<br /><br />This is another toss-off, and it is a fun and inspired album, but inspiration alone doesn't do it when the craft is lacking.<br /><br />It would be a blast to hear Neil and Crazy Horse attack these songs live, but not much is gained by committing them to permanent recording. Neil is such an icon that he gets a free pass on this; it's a one-star or two-star effort but I awarded one extra just for his lifetime's work.<br /><br />If you love Neil and can't get enough, you'll find plenty to like here. If you're a bit more discriminating, you can let this pass gently into that good night. And even if you worship Neil, you'll still want to skip his wretched and indulgent butchering of \\"Get a Job.\\" But we love Neil, and we forgive him.

The previews made it look fun and entertaining, but the movie as a whole had a dark side.  With the smoking and cussing... not to mention the snake and \\"where he came from\\" made for one horrible movie.  The creators and everyone involved could have easily taken it down another road and made it a true kids movie - light and fun and full of laughs.

I've bought both (and read other histories of the war), and can give some details as to their differences.<br /><br />This book is a typical descriptive historical narrative of the war. It is great single source for those who haven't read a comprehensive history of it.  It fairly and with good balance describes the political background and military events and while the writing is somewhat prosaic it is not 'dry', and it gives a well detailed overview of the events.<br /><br />Hastings book \\"Inferno\\" (published in Britain as \\"All Hell Let Loose\\") carries with it a lot more personal observations from diaries, letters, etc of the participants, and clearly is written with the authors own subjective interpretation or points of view on the events, rather than being a pure description of the historical events. The writing is more elegant and provocative, as befits the journalist background of the author.<br /><br />If one has no knowledge of this titanic struggle I would start with Beevor's book so as to capture the events and timelines as they historically occurred, written in a very readable manner.  On the other hand if one is familiar with most of the history I would recommend Hasting's book as a source of opinionated (but supported) insight, along with the many descriptions of the war by participants that are included in his narrative and relate to the historical events.<br /><br />Both are excellent in their own ways. They provide: 1)in the terms of Beevor's book a well written and accurate single volume historical description of the war and 2) in Hastings a more 'op-ed' description with personal stories of the conflict that he has derived from letters, diaries, interviews etc.

B005LAIHY0|2.0|Ridley Scott's PROMETHEUS is a mushy mix-up of science fiction, horror, and new-age spirituality.  The film, set in the year 2093 (29 years before the action in the 1979 film ALIEN takes place), suggests that alien humanoid beings \\"seeded\\" the earth with their own DNA (or a combination of their own DNA and manufactured DNA) in order to create intelligent life.  These alien humanoid beings are the \\"space jockeys\\" first seen in the 1979 film - they are the pilots of the derelict space ship Ripley and her crew discover on the surface of LV-426.  As Dr. Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) concludes in PROMETHEUS, they are the \\"engineers\\" of humanity, or the architects of our intelligent design.<br /><br />This all sounds very deep and complex and earth-shattering, and it could have been.  But it isn't.  Because very little is actually revealed about the \\"space jockeys,\\" their purpose in the universe, or their ultimate connection to life as we know it.  This is a story created backwards.  Scott and his cohorts (including LOST's Damon Lindelof) are doing the \\"reboot\\" thing in PROMETHEUS.  They take the known Alien universe and re-engineer it to set up a new legion of films.  These won't be films about Aliens . . . or even about space.  These are films about creationism.  Who is our father, this film asks.  Who created us?  And why do we ultimately want to destroy our creator, just as our creator wants to destroy us?<br /><br />Basically, PROMETHEUS is about a team of scientists on a corporate-sponsored mission to discover the origins of humanity.  They follow star charts discovered in ancient cave drawings to a planetoid (or moon) light years away, on which they find the remains of a humanoid outpost - the \\"space jockeys\\" of ALIEN fame.  Once they get there, they behave in very unscientific fashion, making every mistake in the book (why, oh why didn't they watch a few sci-fi movies before venturing into that freaky bunker?).  Again, there are cool visuals . . . and a few heart-jumping action scenes.  Bad things happen and a lot of people die.  But it all feels very formulaic, very reminiscent of the other movies, almost as if it was put together from a targeted list (infected crewmember wants back onto the ship, check!; creepy worm thing plunges down someone's throat, check!; someone is \\"impregnated,\\" check!; someone else is chest-busted, check!; water drips everywhere, check!).<br /><br />And not one character is particularly likable or memorable or interesting in any way.  Corporate hack Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron) is a cool icy blond with little to do in the film but walk around and act like she owns the ship (which I guess she does) - she is part of neither the action nor the spiritual heart of the film.  She's just there, and she's dull as dirt.  Shaw (Rapace) is supposed to be the Ripley character, the strong, resourceful woman with the guts to survive.  But she's weepy and silly, making bad decision after bad decision - the worst of which is to get too close to equally silly boyfriend Dr. Charley Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green).  Robot David (Michael Fassbender) is what we expect a robot to be - he alternates between sounding like Hal from 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY and Data from STNG.  We know what robots are like in these films - they're either evil corporate stooges (like Ash in ALIEN) or friendly protectors of humanity (like Bishop in ALIENS).  David is more like Data, I guess - he is intrigued by humanity and by his connection to his creator, corporate honcho Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce, in a horrific old-guy suit).  I guess you could say that David is the most interesting character in the film . . . but that's not saying all that much.  He brings little to the franchise that hasn't already been seen a hundred times.<br /><br />The problem is, Lindelof is doing his \\"Lost thing\\" here.  He throws out just enough intriguing stuff to get his viewers scratching their heads.  What planet do we really see in the opening scenes of thefilm?  There's a gorgeous waterfall and breathtaking vistas.  There's a cool saucer-shaped ship, and something really strange and portentous happens.  Is it Earth?  Is it?  And what planet (or moon or planetoid) do our intrepid band of scientists visit?  Is it the same planet on which ALIEN and ALIENS take place?  Or some other planet in the same system?  So does that mean two \\"space jockey\\" ships crash land in exactly the same way on two different planets?  And what's the black goo all about, and those tiny worms, and the octopus thing?  And why does the technology in 2093 seem light years ahead of the technology in 2122?  Ask all you like, because there are no answers here.  There are \\"suggestions,\\" of course.  And you can make of them whatever you like.  It's the easiest kind of screenplay to write - don't worry about it all making sense; the viewers will fill in the blanks for you!<br /><br />Ultimately, PROMETHEUS is a watchable mess, a conglomeration of stuff that could, in less fractured hands, have come together into a truly great film.  As it is, Scott bows to Lindelof and we get little more than a watchable mess.  It's a gorgeous film, and it's worth seeing.  But it makes little sense.  Wait . . . the sequels will clear everything up for us!  Sure, Mr. Lindelof.  That's what you said about LOST.film?  There's a gorgeous waterfall and breathtaking vistas.

B0086700CM|5.0|It's a really fun addictive game. Great for travel and passing time. Having the objectives makes it frustrating but worth playing multiple times. Overall it's a fun game.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|I would kill for a return to the universe in Old Man's War. Barring a trip back to that world this is a great segway into a sarcastic look at pop SciFi. Having read more of those novels than I care to admit I am forced to commend Scalzi on another well executed, funny, and insightful look into something perhaps best left behind cheap visual effects.
0547569653|5.0|I've read the book once and immediately started reading it again.  I have bookmarks all throughout so that I can go back and try some of the recipes Scott mentions in the book.  Wonderful, thoughtfully written book!

B008239FVC|3.0|My friend bought the white Lifeproof case for her iPhone through AT&T and loves it so when I saw it on amazon for cheaper and in pink I thought I would try it too.<br /><br />Pros: Looks nice, seals the phone up nicely to protect it, and slim protective case<br /><br />Cons: Screen that covers iPhone gets easily scratched during installation, screen also makes the sensitivity of the iPhone less and not all headphone jacks fit into the headphone hole with the case on.<br /><br />Overall it is a nice case, but it does have some flaws as well. May keep it a little while longer just to see if I can grow to like it but will most likely look for a different case instead.
B0070Z97LG|5.0|I have been eyeing this movie on and off at the DVD rental machines at my grocery store for several months. Not sure why I was hesitant but I find that movies nowadays are not all that intriguing. They leave me flat and all I can say to myself is that at least it only cost me $1.30 to rent for a day. Well, tonight I finally rented it and I'm very glad I did. After having viewed this movie I was so grateful to have had such a unique experience. This movie was like a puzzle that kept me guessing throughout. I don't want to give away too many details because by doing so I think it will deflate the unraveling experience of a very clever story line.<br /><br />As a few other reviewers have suggested, I recommend not watching the trailer. It only gives away one segment of the film. Be that as it may, I think this one crucial aspect of the film is better left as a surprise during the viewing of the movie. I was fortunate enough not to see the trailer beforehand. After signing online to leave my review here on amazon.com and watching the trailer here I am in agreement and would advise against viewing it.<br /><br />Fans of Daniel, Naomi and Rachel should not be disappointed. They all do a great job and deliver dependably good performances. I am a pretty big fan of Naomi Watts myself. During the first half or nearly two thirds I wondered why she was in the movie in the first place because her onscreen presence was minimal. But as the story unfolds toward the end her character becomes much more prominent.<br /><br />This is not a scary movie nor is it a thriller. It's more of a complex mystery that involves how our minds can play the worst of tricks on us due to horrible trauma. Sometimes this happens as a way to avoid, cope and/or survive the horrific pain of events that can completely tear our lives apart. There are also strong overtones of being compelled to face one's truth, love for one's family and finally letting go in order to move on. I'd like to go into more detailbut I really believe that this is the type of movie to be enjoyed while knowing as few details as possible.
0393088774|5.0|This should be read by anyone with any interest in the machinations of government and the role of the markets - and how we get out of this mess. Its incredibly important and I hope prompts the end of the ludicrous austerity measures which are afflicting the chances of economic recovery in the West.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Read this for a book club, because one of the members had already started reading it on her own, and recommended saying it was sooo hard to put it down.  Now, I don't consider myself an advanced reader by any stretch, but this book is absolutely terrible - I don't know how it got such rave reviews online and on tv.  From very repetitive vocabulary used by the characters throughout (murmur, mutter, he cocked his head, and holy! Etc), to the totally unbelievable storyline, and the disappointing ending.  I forced myself to finish this because it was for book club and was looking forward to seeing if I was the only one who felt this way.  Unfortunately everybody else gave up within a few chapters, and our book club's meeting this month has been indefinitely postponed.  If you must read this book, see if you can get a copy from the local library, and save your $12.99 for something (anything!) else.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|What can I say about this book besides WOW? I went in a skeptic because bandwagon literature and series tend to be dumbed down for the masses. I found the writing to be urgent, but meaningful. Hurried, but organized. This was all necessary to keep up with the fast tempo of the story. How the author managed to roll along with the abruptness of the progression of the plot, while also developing complex and relatable characters is beyond me but BRAVO. It immediately sucked me in and I literally COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN. I read it all in less than 24 hours. Worth every penny and every minute.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I cannot recommend this book enough! You'll laugh, maybe cry, and definitely look at your dog differently. You won't be able to put it down.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I will admit, there were some style of writing issues I had with this book. At times it felt like it was starting to drag, but them you't get hit with another shocking scene, surprise or revelation and I became fully hooked again! These are minor complaints, overall, I am completely in love with this series and the charcters. I eagerly await the movie adaptation :)
B000005JA8|5.0|\\"Trout Mask Replica\\" is the greatest American Rock'nRoll album of all-time.  Without question.  It doesn't even sound \\"weird\\" to me.  Just sublime and joyful.  6 stars out of 5.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Let me start by saying I loved this trilogy. It carries on just as the first two had, surprise twists, punishments, revelations and all... But after the first two from Ana's perspective, and somewhat repetitive vocabulary/writing style, reading the epilogue from Christian's POV during his and Ana's first encounter is the real gem of this book! I sincerely hope E.L., if she does write another, continues with Christian's POV, because THAT would be incredibly entertaining judgjng from epilogu alone…
B0071XO8RA|5.0|If you got this far to reading my review, go ahead and buy the book. You've probably noticed an outstanding majority of the reviewers giving five stars to this book and they are correct in doing so. It's very well written with a great story and believable characters. Howey created a universe in Wool that contains so much potential for future works of fiction, it really is amazing when you start to think about it.

B007WFQZF0|5.0|All Liars records are dark, the only question is what kind of dark. But it's a journey that you will enjoy and with this album, the dark is filled with their most electronica to date. Angus Andrews, Aaron Hemphill, and Julian Gross may have listened to David Bowie, Radiohead and beck growing up, but the music is 100% theirs and it is a dark, HP Lovecraft CS Lewis fairy tale they tell in art/Indies/noise/experimental prose. Its early Pink Floyd meets The Velvet Underground after the discovery of some 21st century electronic toys.<br /><br />The first single, \\"No. 1 Against The Rush\\" is full of hooks backed by a quiet bouncy beat that sets the lie to trance like and subversive lyric about the the aftermath of a relationship spiraled out of control.<br /><br />The album sounds like it was cut in a darkroom with rusty pipes and a bed best not seen in the daylight. The room has one bare light bulb and is situated above a head shop. Pealing wall paper, left over from the dark ages of some major metropolitan city. Only in the seedy, forgotten part of town where scarred lovers roam and prove that real loneliness is not confined to when you are alone.<br /><br />That's not far from the truth. Liars formed in L.A. six albums ago, but made a move to Brooklyn and making a name for themselves in the post-punk scene with their first album, They Threw Us In A Trench And Stuck A Monument On Top. After breaking out of that pigeon hole, they explored noisy concept compositions about German witches which, of course, lead to a move to Berlin to explore another concept album steeped in surrealism and brutal rhythms. Eventually, they migrated back to L.A. and holed up in a seedy neighborhood above a marijuana dispensary to create another dark and forbidding song cycle. WIXIW picks up from there.<br /><br />The opening track, \\"The Exact Color Of Doubt\\" is a beautiful song in the way that a cobra has beautiful eyes. It lures you in, makes you relax, breathe and then sets its fangs deep into your soul. It's a ballad in slow-mo, its seductive and if it was one of Homers Sirens, it would pull you to your destruction on the rocks of obsession.<br /><br />And just before you get to thinking this is all trance, darkly drawn against the wreckage of a soul lost, Liars hits you with a 4/4 little ditty that almost feels like club music. But then Andrew's distortion filled, an manic voice clears that thought from your mind, and only the truly demented remain on the dance floor. It's electronica dance music run through hell.<br />There are some tracks that are accessible to the current sounds found in clubs, there are the twisted beats of \\"Octagon\\" and \\"III Valley Prodigies\\" seems to flirt with the current fad of rough-hewn `90s sampling.<br /><br />Its an interesting album, and despite its darkness, an appealing album. If nothing else you can shock the hell out of your `with-it' giggle sisters when they crash your pad when the clubs close and want to dance and be oh, so hip.<br /><br />The Dirty Lowdowno your soul.

B001E45XT4|5.0|This is a great gaming headset.  Didn't know it was so great till I actually tried it on.  Been playing Battlefield 3 with them, and they work like a boss.  Deep bass for explosions, etc.  Music also sounds really good with them.  If you want something reasonable priced, go with the GameCom 367.  You won't regret it.
B005B0QYMM|3.0|A &#34;ghost hunter&#34; Lance Preston (Sean Rogerson) and his reality TV show staff spend a night inside the deserted mental institute that was abandoned for more than fifty years ago after a bloody incident. They are to realize the folly too late, as they find themselves trapped inside the abandoned building.  Directed by the Vicious Brothers (actually Collin Minihan and Stuart Ortiz), &#34;Grave Encounters&#34; looks like a cross between &#34;Paranormal Activity&#34;-like so-called found-footage genre and a more orthodox &#34;haunted house&#34; horror film. The combination is not really a new idea, and the film spends too much time setting up the second half of it, where things get much better.  In the first half of the film, what you will see you have seen somewhere else in a more effective way. Some sequences are creepy, but not scary enough for avid fans of the genre, who would find the film's scares predictable. This is not to say the mocumentary horror film is totally unoriginal. There is one intriguing idea about the surreal condition the hapless film crew is in - they are literally trapped inside the disused hospital in a supernatural way.  This is when the film gets interesting. &#34;Grave Encounters&#34; is pretty entertaining if you can sit through the dull first half.

0345803485|1.0|With so much \\"Buzz\\" about these books I had to buy them to check it out for myself. I was very disappointed. The first book appalled me and I put it down for days but picked it back up because for some reason I just had to know what happened. I assumed he finally gave in, admitted his love for her and all was perfect. I'm sure that is what happens before the end of the trilogy but I just don't have it in me to read the other two.<br /><br />The story is so repetitive. Not just the story but the actual writing is repetative. There is only a minimal storyline. Basically it reminds me of a porn or Playboy magazine. Nobody really reads the articles, they just look at the pictures. The same is true for this book. If your looking for a good read, this isn't it. If you are looking for trashy sex then this book may be for you.

B000068OCS|5.0|we can not rid ourselves of the knotted hive of the industrial complexes without stop wanting the goods and services that it produces. this tour de force uses only two vehicales to produce a complete image ; pictures and very<br />impressive Glass music. these take us along to ask the individual questions on<br />civilization,structure, and morality.you can not just let this movie wash over you.
0345803485|5.0|Lot of sex and bondage not meant for the pure and innocent. Love this trilogy. Author is very descriptive which I love.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|It starts out slow.  It's about a woman with a poor self image and no sexual experience.  She's intelligent and shy.  If the male wasn't rich, the law would, could go after him for abuse.  The book makes it seem OK to abuse women because a man can make them enjoy the abuse.  This is icky if you believe any of this mindset.
0345803507|5.0|One of the besti series I've ever read! It is strongly sexual and may offend some. I find it hot and erotic
1439170916|5.0|This book chronicles cancer from thousands of years ago to roughly 2009.  The author presents many aspects of cancer including prevention vs. detection/diagnosis vs. cure and he also explains numerous studies and trials that have been performed over many years and countries.<br /><br />The book is completely engaging and it conjures numerous emotions including desperation, frustration, optimism, and joy.  The science is presented for laypeople, and the author shows a great enthusiasm and passion for the science--which makes the reader feel it, too.<br /><br />My personal frustration with the book (and this has nothing to do with the author) is the highly inefficient attempts at identifying cures (and causes).  My specialty is optimization, and the approaches taken in all the investigations seemed frustratingly wasteful and usually ineffective.  I wish cancer researchers would include mathematicians and statisticians that specialize in optimization methods for minimizing R&D time and cost.<br /><br />Overall, this is one of the most interesting and relevant books of our time.  Kudos to a spectacular author!!!!
0345803485|5.0|I just finished the trilogy.  Yes, there were repetitions, but I thoroughly enjoyed the love story!  I did not feel Ana was weak!  I even loved Christian in spite of his issues!  I loved all 3 books!

Many of the parks have marginal wifi at best and the Alfa products allow us to get on-line in RV sites at the end of the park far away from the tower.  The Alfa software installs easily and I have used it on Windows XP, Vista, and 7.  These product make it possible for us to work from our RV and not spend our time hunting down hot spots.

0553386794|3.0|well I will say one thing about the book, it's not as \\"amazingly written\\" as everyone said it was.  It's not unlikable though, not is it not enjoyable, it's just not \\"phenomenal\\" as I'd been told.  I am, however, a very harsh judge and maybe have a handful of books in my experience that I would grace with words like that.<br /><br />now about this copy...<br /><br />It looked like a children's book.  There is a big banner stating an HBO show has been made out of it, fantastic... I feel trashier just reading it now.  The cover has a picture from the show as you can see, it is HUGE, not a book you can easily stow in a purse or small bag, and the print is enormous and the margins are huge.  The book is maybe about 700 pages, but there is no need for it to be, the print is gigantic, I'm guessing 12-14 point font, and the margins are unnecessarily giant, making what could easily be 1 page of text spread out to 2 or 2.5 pages of giant text.  It looks like a children's or pre-teen's book just by this, which ups the embarassment factor, as if the giant red banner stating it is an HBO TV series isn't enough.<br /><br />if there is an original version of print, without the HBO crap on it, in normal sized font and margins, I'd be more inclined to have that, and recommend it.  This is... tacky and crappy honestly.  The cover isn't even sturdy, it is quite flimsy and within 2-3 days of owning the book it has curled entirely up so that when left alone, the cover stands up on its own like a framed picture.  The book flops around when I pick it up and I'm scared to take it anywhere because I feel like it will rip or fall apart, not that I really want to with the way it looks... yes I'm vain when it comes to books, I don't want to look like I'm reading \\"Twilight\\" or some garbage, and that's exactly how it looks to me when you glance at the cover or the inside of this book sadly.
0812992792|3.0|I read this book from the library as the kindle version was too expensive for casual pick-up. If I'd found that it was a book I wanted to share with those on my kindle network or read again, I would have purchased a kindle copy. I didn't. I selected this book for reading because I was interested in gaining more insight into the culture of North Korea and because it was such a highly rated book (Editor picks etc).<br /><br />The book changes POV frequently and it was sometimes difficult to follow because of this. There is substantial gruesome torture, which wasn't a surprise to me and a constant focus on food and lack thereof. People disappear (and you didn't really have to guess what happened to them). Reference to a retiree community on the 'shore' where friends and relatives go upon retirement became particularly gruesome as it became clear what had happened to these people. The main character was somewhat interesting and the main element that pulled me through the entire book. He starts off as a child in an orphanage where his father works (hence the orphan-master's son). His mother has disappeared. He goes through a series of 'jobs' including pain training, working in tunnels and mines, etc until he ends up on a fishing boat as a covert radio operator listening and recording various transmissions. A whole lot of really awful things happen after this point. It is somewhat interesting to gain some possible insight into the way a North Korean might view American culture. Midway through the book this character actually ends up in Texas with some politically oriented cohorts on a brief politically motivated visit. Their response to a Texas bar-b-que was almost amusing. And I never really understood why the North Koreans were kidnapping people from the shores of Japan (scratching head). The ending is not particularly beautiful either, although it takes a bit of juggling to remember what happened to whom and bring all the main characters to some sort of end-point in the story. All in all, I don't think I'd recommend this book to anyone unless they had a particular interest in North Korea. It's definitely NOT a casual beach read!e story. All in all, I don't think I'd recommend this book to anyone unless they had a particular interest in North Korea. It's definitely NOT a casual beach read!

0670921076|5.0|I heard only one episode of \\"Midnight in Peking\\" on BBC Radio 4. I found it so gripping and intriguing that I stopped listening and immediately ordered the book from Amazon.co.uk ([I could have bought one from Amazon.com, but ordering the UK version of the book made it all the more exciting]). I was not disappointed.<br /><br />Mr French's account of the unsolved brutal murder of young Pamela Werner in the last days before Peking fell to Japanese invaders riveted my attention from beginning to end. The author not only follows the evidential trail of the investigation meticulously, but he also evokes the ambience of Peking's vanished past. He sets the mood in the opening chapter with his evocative account of the reputed malevolent spirits that haunt the Fox Tower, the great eastern gate of the city. I loved his detailed descriptions that swept me from the outwardly respectable elegance of the Legation Quarter into the squalor of the Hutong--the tawdry maze of alleys--of the 'Badlands', with rickshaws, 'fast-food' restaurants, and brothels; where down-at-the-heels Russian emigr&eacute;s mingled with pimps and prostitutes, as well as with 'respectable' people who were merely out for an evening's slumming.<br /><br />The book's illustrations--including coloured photos, postcards; newspaper squibs; and black-and-white photographs of the protagonists--enhance the narrative (I especially liked the vintage photo of the long-gowned Peking gentleman walking his caged bird). My only complaint is the absence of a map, which would have aided me to visualise the topography of this vast city, since visualisation is important to appreciating the author's intricate descriptions (I found maps of the old city on the publisher's website, but I would have liked to have had one--even a diagram map--in the book; the omission seems singular in light of the other copious illustrations).<br /><br />I especially liked the way that Mr French tells the story from the respective points of view of the Chinese Detective, the British Detective, and the Father. As the tangled mystery begins to unfold, we learn what each of them learns, and as they learn it. If we never actually discover Pamela's motivations (e.g., exactly why she was expelled from the various schools she attended in her short life), it is because the author is playing fair: he tells only what the evidence reveals, and he relates it gradually, as it is revealed, red herrings and all. Any further speculation about Pamela's character would take us into the realm of fiction, a temptation that the author rightly avoids.<br /><br />'Who killed Pamela?' proves, in the end, less elusive than 'Who was Pamela?'--a question that remains unanswered. Part of the fascination with the case--and with Mr French's narrative--rests in the fact that Pamela, herself, remains a mystery.  We catch only a glimpse of her. It is as if we had picked up copies of the 1937 newspapers, which were obsessed with the horrific murder, until even more horrific stories of a world gone truly mad pushed Pamela's story off the front pages forever.<br /><br />Like the insubstantial fox spirits, which were said to flicker \\"briefly before disappearing\\" [247], Pamela's image flickers before us momentarily, and then simply disappears.Chinese Detective, the British Detective, and the Father.

1594744769|3.0|When I purchased this book I expected a creepy little read. I was wrong.<br /><br />My issue with the book is that it wasn't anything special or all that interesting. I did finish the book, but while I was reading I kept waiting for something big to happen to justify the story.<br /><br />The one redeeming thing in this book was some of the children. The ones featured in the book did shine unlike the story.<br /><br />The open ending is sketchy at best and lack luster. From what I understand this book is the start of a series.
0140177396|5.0|This book is a tragic tale about two men named George and Lennie. This book is a tale of Two migrant field workers in California on their plantation during the Great Depression--George Milton, an intelligent but uneducated man, and Lennie Small, a man of large stature and great strength but limited mental abilities--are on their way to another part of California in Soledad. They hope to one day attain their shared dream of settling down on their own piece of land. Lennie's part of the dream is merely to tend to (and touch) soft rabbits on the farm. This dream is one of Lennie's favorite stories, which George constantly retells. They are fleeing from their previous employment in Weed, California, where they were run out of town after Lennie's love of stroking soft things resulted in an accusation of attempted rape when he touched a young woman's dress, and would not let go. It soon becomes clear that the two are close friends and George is Lennie's protector.At the ranch, the situation appears to be menacing and dangerous, especially when the pair are confronted by Curley--the boss's small-statured aggressive son with an inferiority complex who dislikes larger men--leaving the gentle giant Lennie potentially vulnerable. Curley's flirtatious and provocative wife, to whom Lennie is instantly attracted, poses a problem as well. In sharp contrast to these two characters, the pair also meets Slim, the kind, intelligent and intuitive jerkline skinner whose dog has recently had a litter of puppies. Slim gives a puppy to Lennie.In spite of the potential problems on the ranch, their dream leaps towards reality when Candy, the aged, one-handed ranch hand, offers to pitch in with George and Lennie so that they can buy a farm at the end of the month in return for permission to live with them on it. The trio are ecstatic, but their joy is overshadowed when Curley attacks Lennie. He then, urged on by George, catches Curley's fist and crushes it, reminding the group there are stillobstacles to overcome before their goal is reached.Nevertheless, George feels more relaxed, since the dream seems just within their grasp, to the extent that he even leaves Lennie behind on the ranch while he goes into town with the other ranch hands. Lennie wanders into the stable, and chats with Crooks, the bitter, yet educated stable buck, who is isolated from the other workers because he is black. Candy finds them and they discuss their plans for the farm with Crooks, who cannot resist asking them if he can hoe a garden patch on the farm, despite scorning the possibility of achieving the dream. Curley's wife makes another appearance and flirts with the men, especially Lennie. However, her spiteful side is shown when she belittles them and is especially harsh towards Crooks because of his race, threatening to have him lynched.Lennie accidentally kills his puppy while stroking it. Curley's wife enters the barn and tries to speak to Lennie, admitting that she is lonely and how her dreams of becoming a movie star are crushed, revealing the reason she flirts with the ranch hands. After finding out that Lennie loves stroking soft things, she offers to let him stroke her hair, but panics and begins to scream when she feels his strength. Lennie becomes frightened, and in the scuffle, unintentionally breaks her neck. When the other ranch hands find the body, George unhappily realizes that their dream is at an end. George hurries away to find Lennie, hoping he will be at the meeting place they designated at the start of the novel in case Lennie got into trouble, knowing that there is only one thing he can do to save Lennie from the painful death that Curley's lynch mob intends to deliver.George meets Lennie at the designated place, the same spot they camped in the night before they came to the ranch. The two sit together and George retells the beloved story of the bright future together that they will never share. He then shoots Lennie in the back of the head, so that his death will be painless and happy. Curley, Slim, and Carlson find George seconds after the shooting. Only Slim realizes that George killed Lennie out of love, and gently and consolingly leads him away, while Curley and Carlson look on, unable to comprehend the subdued mood of the two men.
B007WFR1MQ|4.0|....and the reason I say this is because I only purchased the MP3's.  The album is supposed to be in a 'story mode' format, so obviously I'm missing the greater portion of what Bell was trying to sell with this album.  That's OK, because I'm a professed Fear Factory whore, have loved everything they've accomplished and produced, and will continue to.<br />Being a fan of the Industrial-metal scene, I'm continually starved for this music, so my review will be biased, but anyone who may not be familiar with most of what Fear Factory is all about, just realize that these guys are pioneers and in my humble opinion, the Grandfathers of TRUE Industrial-metal.  Everything they've produced is so pure and perfect in this genre, that I feel any future bands (and current for that matter) will be constantly compared to them.  They're just that phenomenal.<br />As for the album itself, I have to tend to agree with a lot of the other sentiment of how Mechanize was just a bit superior to this effort.  However, considering that Bell, Cazares and Fulber decided to push ahead with no actual drummer I think truly says alot about their collective abilities and bravity.  It's either that or they're incredibly ego-maniacal.  Probably both.<br />As I said, probably better than 4 stars, but overall, great effort and will always be looking forward to their futuristic, and forward-thinking sounds.  Leave you with this question:  Has anyone else had sex while listening to these guys?
B000PC6Z48|3.0|Chances are if you're thinking of watching this you're a fan of Sergio Leone's films and the Italian western. That being the case, I'd recommend Django but suggest you manage your expectations.<br /><br />First, the similarities with Leone. You see a lot of familiar faces from the Dollars films. There's also plenty of ingenious and well orchestrated violence with some very clever set pieces: the gun battle in the muddy town (overtones of WWI here?), the fist fight in the saloon where the camerawork is incredibly mobile, especially for the period. Plenty of the aesthetics are familiar too from the sound effects (the gun shot sound is exactly the same) to the sets which were designed by Carlo Simi (here credited as Giancarlo), though in the latter the differences creep in. Instead of the dust dry south-west, Django is set in the lush and wet mid-west.<br /><br />However, many trademark aspects of Leone's film making are missing and here the comparisons are not favourable. The most obvious difference is that Django wasn't shot in Techniscope. It makes a huge difference to the look and feel of the film. Also absent is Leone's appreciation of grotesque physiognomy. The other sorely missed element is that the score wasn't written by Morricone. It's impossible to stress what a difference this makes. Even Morricone's less successful music, say in Once upon a time the Revolution, adds a cohesion and mood to Leone's films that is unique. That said the title track of Django is a winner!<br /><br />What about Corbucci in his own right? He certainly has some moments, from the opening sequence where Django is dragging a coffin through the wilderness, to the moment when he reveals its contents and when the `red masks' invade town. Franco Nero isn't Clint Eastwood but does brings a silent charisma to the part.<br /><br />Django is a must see for fans of the spaghetti western but it's very much second league in comparison to Leone - which maybe an unfair comparison. A huge number ofsequels were made, though only one 'official one' (in the late 70s if I recall) though I suggest these are left to the aficionados only! 3.5 stars.
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|This is a great product for the kindle, provides a low profile protective cover that allows for propping so that you can read or watch movies.  The outer material began to peel almost immediately and so cosmetically it looks awful, but this doesn't bother me at all. I keep the kindle in my back pocket so and this cover protects it very well with no issues after 6 months of heavy use.  If it didn't do its job then it would get low star rating for the peeling, but since it works I can't complains.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|I sometimes read reviews where people say they love the film but then give it 1 star because they don't like the blu-ray conversion or because a certain scene has been cut etc. I love Once Upon a Time in the West far too much to do that - however, I do want to comment on the commentary.<br /><br />It's a mixed bag ranging from the brilliant to the banal. Mostly it's by Christopher Frayling and here it is exceptional. Frayling is a renowned expert on the subject and supplies plenty of background context as well as fascinating details. The film historian Sheldon Hall's sections, although not quite as good, are also informative. Which brings me to the remaining commentaries - by John Milius, John Carpenter, Claudia Cardinale and Alex Cox.<br /><br />I assume the producer of the DVD was so overwhelmed at getting such big names that he agreed to have them so he could tag them on the box without considering whether they had anything interesting or even valid to say. So we have Milius talking about eating pasta with Leone or Cardinale recounting details of her previous film. The comments reach their nadir, however, with John Carpenter who not only admits (I paraphrase) that he doesn't know what the scene in Morton's train is about but that he hasn't seen the film in twenty years! Hardly informative.<br /><br />So for the commentary 3.5 stars and a wasted opportunity. Either they should have guided the star names to be more relevant or better still, left it all to the erudite and endlessly listenable Frayling.<br /><br />PS - if you haven't seen this film I can't recommend it enough!
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|I saw this Saturday night and again Sunday afternoon. It is the most beautiful sci-fi flick I've probably ever seen. But there are problems with this movie. It's too vague. A segment here... a segment there... and Prometheus could have been an all time classic. Plus there's one plot line that is totally unnecessary. I'll buy it tho.
0547569653|5.0|Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. The man is an inspiration. The book is enlightening (and very well written). It's one of those books that you can't wait to read and finish feeling like you have done something meaningful (then gobbled down a supremely tasty and healthy meal). The antidote to people like Dean Karnazes or whatever his name is.

B0088RQ4X4|4.0|Edgar Rice Burroughs published the Princess of Mars in 1912.  Since then, readers have been captivated by his Science Fiction and Tarzan series which subsequently influenced them in their own careers as writers, scientists, and directors. If you can step back past modern imitations, you can appreciate the author as a true master of originality and cast a favorable perspective on the movie. John Carter was unappreciated by the critics.  The female lead and the acting of John Carter's nephew felt artifical at times, however, the other characters were strong and enjoyable.  Our family recommends this movie.
B007MDB71O|5.0|Quite surprised at how enjoyable this movie was. I had really not heard much of it when it was in the theaters, didn't give any thought to seeing it. I picked it up after having seen some clips on You Tube. Glad I did. Beautifully rendered to the bluray format on my 60\\" Panasonic. The story started out just a tad slow, but once it got going (Carter makes it to \\"Mars\\"), it started to flow. Great cinematography, laced with some good humor and steady acting. The lead actor was a bit too \\"GC\\" (Gentleman's Quarterly), but he did a good job. The strength of the movie, however was in it's special effects. It's a movie that you will have no trouble enjoying.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|An excellent conclusion to the famous trilogy. An excellent supplement to the 3 movies I also purchased from Amazon a few months ago.
B0086700CM|5.0|its freaking great that kindle has this game now because I am addicted, and can play in my phone and in here when my phone dies :) !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0061537934|1.0|I will spare the review reader many words.  Lets just say:<br />a.  The voice is annoying (a dog's favorite actors?)<br />b.  The story is trite (was this written by Erich Segal under a pseudonym?)<br />c.  The writing is banal (enough with big breasts and racing analogies)<br /><br />The plus?  It is a good weight for throwing and playing fetch with a dog (but preferably, not one like Enzo who can read).
B0083EY9EI|4.0|Gotta love Emeli's voice! There are multiple songs where she is drown out by excessive production, however. With her voice you don't really need \\"all that\\" extra. If it weren't for these distractions, I would have given it a 5. It will be exciting to see her growth from one album to the next.
0345803485|5.0|I absolutely loved this trilogy. All my friends read the books and raved about them. I ordered all 3 at the same time and am glad I did. Once I picked up the first book, I couldn't stop reading! I want my own Christian Grey!! These books opened my mind up to all the possibilities of what I could have in the bedroom. Its a must read and will not be disappointed!
B0088TG252|5.0|One of the best movies from 2012/11 harvest when it comes to spy/action/ploy movies. Good story, with good pace and great performance of actors. Definitely worth watching.
0399215921|5.0|Spiders are very interesting insects for a couple of reasons. They can have a lot of legs, usually eight, they can eat flies with the help of their string, and can make webs with them and can be big or small. But for one spider, it's determined t obuild and finish its web.<br />Set in a farm, a small spider is trying to build a web and will not let anything distract it from it. For example, when a sheep asks if it wants to go the meadow, or when a dog asks it if itwants to chase a cat, or when a cat wants to take a nap, the spider simply refuses it and continues to work on her web.<br />It's definitely short, but it's still a Eric Carle orginal. Toddlers will truely enjoy the color and feeling of the book. It even teaches them to be focused on their accheivements and not be distracted. Pretty soon, they'll learn to be very busy spiders.

1595825045|5.0|Oh, be still my beating heart! This is deffinately my new favorite artbook that I own.<br />I'm not just saying this from a biased perspective of also being an Avatar show fan.<br /><br />I've tried other production artbooks before. Pixar, Dreamworks, some dissapointing Disney, as well as a few misc ones...<br />And they also seem to place either more movie stills to artwork ratio...Or even out the odds with masses of text.<br /><br />This book does neither. What has stolen my tiny heart is the fact that this book is about 90% production artwork and sketches. It goes into extreme detail of many episodes of the show. It's just amazing! If this book were a person, I'd totally propose right there on the spot.<br /><br />The price is more than reasonable. Especially for a book of this quality.<br />If you've been spurned in the past by lazy production books, weep no more. I highly reccomend you add this one to your shopping cart. Trust me. It will be the best decision you ever made, in terms of artbooks <3!

B007K3JCAE|4.0|Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law return as Holmes and Watson, along with Rachel McAdams, Kelly Reilly, and other minor characters from the previous film. Downey and Law have the same fantastic chemistry as before. Though, Downey seems to be acting even more eccentric than ever as he follows the clues and his wild theories on a high speed adventure across Europe. Noomi Rapace as Madam Simza, a gypsy who Downey and Law must team up with along the way. Simza is a mysterious character, though a bit wooden. Jared Harris does an excellent job as the infamous Professor Moriarty. As Holmes' greatest adversary in the original novels, Moriarty is the only person who is on the same intellectual level as Holmes.<br /><br />A Game of Shadows is a strong sequel to Downey's first Sherlock Holmes film. I enjoyed this story a bit more in fact, as there were no elements of the bizarre mysticism of the first. This was another wild ride of humor, drama, mystery, and action-packed adventure.  The mystery and suspense kept me guessing and on the edge of my seat. And the many comic relief lines had me laughing out loud. The suspense built to a massive climactic ending that was a bit predictable, yet completely enjoyable all the same.

B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I was very reluctant to pick this series up as the subject matter did not seem like something I wanted to read.  Since a relative had read it and said it was worth it, I took a chance and I am very pleased I did.  The story line is brilliant and complex, Larsson always has you thinking and guessing and wondering. This third book is a brilliant conclusion to the series. With the second book in the series, there were times that I had to walk away from it for a while just because the angst was so high. This third book I could barely put it down as I wanted to find out what happens next.  It's a wild ride that goes in directions unexpected. Larsson adds so many side stories and doesn't just plop down a single plot, it makes for a much more interesting book without it feeling too contrived or forced. It's just the right amount of complexity to keep it very interesting.  I appreciate the out-of-left-field things that occur. It's great to be surpised when reading a book considering so many seem formulaic some days.  This is anything but that, very original and very compelling.  I highly recommend it.

B005HJWWW8|4.0|This is the first time I have felt justified in usage to buy an amp since I never had the range of headphone or device that needed one. However since I refuse to pay for turtlebeaches(because they are inflexible and overpriced for what they are) I use this amp in my headphone setup when im playing my xbox.<br /><br />I did spend a lot of time researching amps when I was intending to buy some expensive headphones(+$200) and this was on the list of inexpensive possibles to be able to drive high resistance headphones. It does as I previously read feel somewhat cheap in comparison to the metallic Fiio E5s, but unless you plan on stepping/stomping on this thing you should not have a serious problem.<br /><br />Clip is functional, yet awkward, and you do have to keep in mind to turn it off when you are not using it since this device does not feature auto off functionality.<br /><br />Other than that it works for what I needed it for and I am good when I get the headphones I was previously going to buy.

B007P06DJK|4.0|The CD/Music sounds great!  I bought the CD new and both the CD and the DVD had residue on the discs from the packaging.

I would find it hard to believe I'm the only one who would experience this.
0307951529|5.0|I hate to start a review off with an anecdote about karma, but coincidentally this book arrived unexpectedly in the mail the day after $300 was stolen from my purse. So getting this book was quite a pleasant surprise. I am not quite sure how I ended up on a list to receive a review copy of the book (I do run a lit mag, but it was sent to my home address), but at any rate, I am so glad I did. I've been thinking of getting back into freelancing for some time now--hard to make ends meet these days even with a good, solid day job. That's why it was so devastating to have that money stolen. I know I am rambling, but I wanted to set up the situation and my mindset when I starting reading Chris Guillebeau's book. This book certainly inspired me to get serious about working on my own. What is so appealing about this book is that it's chock-full of real-life, business venture stories from a variety of people, places and industries. While $100 may not be what every successful soloprenuer in this book started with (in many cases it was a lot more), this book paints a realistic picture of starting a business with the tools available today. Now, more than ever, people can get into business more quickly and reach more people thanks to user-friendly ecommerce carts, etc. All one really needs is an idea, a plan, the commitment (which is where I personally was lacking), and a bit of logistics. Chris takes you through those basic steps in easy-to-read chapters with helpful summaries and provides tons of resources in the book and its online supplement to help people get started. What I also loved about this book was its transparency--that's a buzz word we hear in the online world so often today and it really shows that Chris and his book are authentic and credible--disclosures, footnotes, etc. If you are like me, you are more inspired by story-telling and real-word examples rather than a lecture on how to start a business. This book is just that -- real stories and emotions mixed in with professional advice from someone who has been there and done that. I dog-eared many pages in this book, but one quote that really stood out for me was, \\"Make something worth talking about and then talk about it.\\" Sounds so logical, right? The message of this book is inspiring, but in now way does it make promises. Another reason I am a big fan of this book: I love the clever headlines and graphics. If you want to start your own business and are web savvy, I highly recommend this book. The book is not limited to web-based businesses by any means, but my background is in eCommerce so I just want to throw that out there that this book is especially helpful for those interested in an online business.ith professional advice from someone who has been there and done that.

B005LAIH3G|3.0|I didn't see this in the theater and heard mixed reviews from people who saw it. Figure I'd check it out for myself on blu-ray.  Even though the movie tanked at the box office, I went into it hoping the glowing fan reviews on Amazon and elsewhere would be worth at least an enjoyable movie. It started out well enough and I enjoyed it up to the point he got to Mars.  After that, it just wasn't that good. Sure, it had a bunch of special effects, but other than that, there wasn't really much else.  The characters weren't really fleshed out, the CG wasn't that great, and I just didn't engage with any of the characters.  It was big, loud, and tried to be epic, but for all that, it just wasn't much fun. Kind of reminded me of the feeling I got watching Attack of The Clones. That said, I'm actually looking forward to reading the Barsoom novels.

B00005OMTT|3.0|I did not realize there are some of the same songs on this CD as others we have from same group and it was not long enough.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I am grateful I did not pay for this book. The characters are pathetic. The story had potential, but unfortunately I wanted to throw the book across the room about 50 times. I kept reading, hoping there was something to justify the success of this book. There wasn't. I can only assume now that it is so popular because so many women are having sex that is so unfulfilling and unimaginative that they actually think the sex in this book is wild and erotic.  It's sad really.

B006512BFU|2.0|I had not heard about this film and so came to it without expectation.  The film begins with a cool, stylistic and indeed hypnotic ambience which is at once gripping and intriguing.  We are introduced to the main character, a sex addict who is at first portrayed as a charismatic, sexually alluring New York exec, a roving lothario with erything going for him.  So far so good.  The film leads you subtly onwards, into the character; the feel of the film is icy, detached, a hint perhaps at the interior world of Fassbender's character.  There is a scene early on in the film when Brandon is out with his boss and some other colleagues in a bar drinking hard and in obvious pursuit of women.  Fassbender's boss is loud, obnoxious and moronic, whereas Fassbender is contrasted as cool and controlled.  His boss spots a group of single women drinking at the bar and decides to make his move, and as he struts over Fassbender remarks that he bets that he messes it up.  Indeed his chat-up style is cringing if not totally confident, but he does gradually begin to win the women over to him per force.  As they prepare themselves for some tequila shots Fassbender sidles up and joins in.  He says little and drinks, yet he appears to intrigue one of the women, who gives him the eye while she dances with his idiotic boss.  The eveining fizzles out and Fassbender puts his dejected boss into a cab before walking home.  On his journey a car pulls up and offers him a lift and he jumps in.  It was the woman from the bar and in the next scene he's thrusting into her against a wall in the street.  For me this is where the film ends.  You realise that he says little not because he is the silent mysterious type but because he has nothing to say, his boss is atleast human.  The abject misery, shame and lonliness of sex addiction is well put but sadly the film is as empty and meaningless as the character is portrays.  It is gratiutous and without redemption.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I got the Wool Omnibus for my Kindle because of the great word-of-mouth notice it was getting. For the price it was a no-brainer to take a chance on this unknown, self-published author. And I am so glad that I did. What I found was a compelling, very human and character driven story set in a future where everything is coming apart. Through the stories he tells, Hugh Howey pulls us into that future and makes us feel the danger in a visceral way. Not since my first reading of Ender's Game years ago has a work of Science Fiction has affected me this intensely. I highly recommend this work to anyone who wants a few hours of pure exhilarating escape.<br /><br />The Omnibus contains the  Wool novellas 1-5. I was hooked from the first page and could do nothing else until I had read the whole thing. I liked this work so much that I purchased the rest of Mr. Howey's catalog which is also available in the Kindle Store. Of those, I especially liked the Molly Fyde series and Hurricane. Hurry and get on board so you can be one of the in-crowd when the recently optioned Wool movie finally appears.
B0086700CM|5.0|very good graphics when I first got the I just couldn't stop playing very addicting very fun game you'll stay up all night playing
B007U1FEJE|5.0|I was skeptical at first too, until I heard some of the clips online and saw the band's recent show in LA. I haven't bought a CD in a decade, in fact I don't even know where to go buy one in person.  It's a delightful album, and I've listened to it 4 times already. The harmonies are amazing, as good as anything I've heard from the BB before, though they are of course getting some help from others here.  For those of us at a certain age (me 50+), the themes really seem appropriate at this point in my life. I bought the CD and played it while cruising down Hawthorne Blvd drove right past the Fosters Freeze and the Pizza Show where the boys used to hang out .... what a nostalgia kick that was!!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Okay, Fifty Shades of Grey is poorly written, however, that said, I had to force myself to put down the book at night so that I wouldn't be exhausted at work the next day.  Anastasia and Christian Grey are quite the pair.  This naive, new college grad is always biting her lips (driving Christian crazy) and having mental arguments with her subconscious (both of these habits get old really fast) and his moods shift more often than a crack baby with a gold-barbed pacifier.  But their emails are so hilarious, from the subject line to the closing. The sexy, edgy banter is so refreshingly fresh that I commend the author, E L James and look forward to reading the next book in the trilogy.<br /><br />The intimate scenes could have been reduced by half and the book would have been much stronger.  But for some fast-paced, steamy entertainment, you can't miss.<br /><br />Marie Estorge<br />author of STORKBITES: A MEMOIR<br />and CONFESSIONS OF A BI-POLAR MARDI GRAS QUEEN

B00474GUEA|5.0|If you're a fan of the recent \\"80's synth-pop\\" resurgence, then this album is the pinnacle.  Johnny Jewel's production is masterful, mixing those synthetic sounds with a dash of disco, alt-rock, and at times even trance music (which I'm generally not a fan of, but it works well here).  \\"I Want Your Love\\" really achieves that so-called \\"Italo-disco\\" vibe that Jewel was going for.  Woven into the underlying synth-pop sound, there are hints of Joy Division (\\"Healer\\"), The Knife (\\"Mask\\"), and a wide variety of other influences.  Radelet's vocals are often reminiscent of Debbie Harry and Kate Bush (in fact, the track \\"Running Up That Hill\\" is a cover of the latter).<br /><br />The only bad thing I could possibly write about this album is that tracks \\"Tomorrow Is So Far Away\\" and \\"Tick Of The Clock\\" initially come off as unnecessarily repetitive, but after a few listens I began to pick up on the idiosyncrasies that are buried within.<br /><br />Incredibly rewarding album ... well worth the $7.99 that Amazon is currently charging.

B005FLX2WC|5.0|If Beth Hart and Joe Bonamassa fail to win a grammy for this recording, then there simply is no justice in this world.  Even my wife can't seem to take it out of her player in the car and who would want to?  It has all the elements that make this blues recording great.  It's an instant classic.  I can't say enough about Beth Hart's voice.  She can do things with it that defy the laws of physics.  If you haven't heard her before you are in for a real treat and you'll find yourself purchasing each and every one of her recordings that you can get your hands on.  Joe Bonamassa's playing and tone are impecable.  Very tasteful and compliment the whole idea behind this recording.  I can't complain about the song selection either.  You will listen to this recording hundreds of times and you will have favorite tracks.  My wife loves Chocolate Jesus, I'd Rather Go Blind and I'll Take Care of You.  My favorites are Your Heart Is Black As Night, For My Friends and my absolute favorite, the title track Don't Explain.  The truth is they're all good.  If you have even a remote interest in the blues purchase this recording immediately.  You'll be glad you did.
B004QL7K6G|3.0|It sounds like a recipe for greatness. Take Judd Apatow, the creative genius behind [[ASIN:B002NWUBDY The 40-Year-Old Virgin]] and [[ASIN:B0010R08PO Superbad]] and add him to David Wain, the writer-director of [[ASIN:B0027C7JIA Role Models]] and one of the driving forces behind the now-defunct comedy troupe [[ASIN:B00274SITW The State]]. Throw in more than a few seasoned comedic actors (Paul Rudd, Alan Alda, Justin Theroux, and many of the same actors and actresses from the aforementioned comedy group) and the star power of Jennifer Aniston. You'd expect the end result to be an above-average comedy, if not downright hilarious.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. Wanderlust isn't a bad film, but it doesn't really try very hard to be great. This might have something to do with the story, which is built so firmly on a tired cliche that none of the surrounding jokes can rise too high above it. The plot concerns George and Linda, two New Yorkers that have found themselves on the verge of bankruptcy and failure. In an attempt to avoid total destitution, the couple moves to Georgia to stay with George's horribly obnoxious brother, Rick (played by the writer of the movie, Ken Marino). Along the way, they detour to a very special bed-and-breakfast that turns out to be a hippie commune called Elysium. Cue: nudity, drugs, free love, and the loss of privacy and personal property.<br /><br />There are few directions to take this plot in that haven't been done before, and Wanderlust gives each of them a bit of play. Some people in the commune turn out to be not as wholesomely granola as they appear. George and Linda's addiction to work and money doesn't turn out to be so vile and absurd. Drugs and free love may or may not offer quite the utopia that they seem to. And, of course, real estate developers are all underhanded slime bags who only care about building casinos. In Georgia.<br /><br />Ha ha ha ha! Oh, silly movie. Commercial gambling isn't legal in Georgia! (You can hop on a casino boat in Savannah, but gambling isn't allowed until you're in international waters.) Ah, but who cares?<br /><br />I do. This is evidence of laziness. The evil real-estate developers did not have to be building a casino. It could have easily been any other symbol of American soullessness, such as a strip mall, or series of resorts, or something else not nearly so cliched and overused. The point being, instead of trying to be creative or clever, Marino went with the first immediately available stereotype and shoved it into the script, regardless of if it made sense or not. The same goes for most of the jokes about hippies and even suburban life (Rick's mortally depressed housewife is over-medicated and in hilarious (?) denial; hippies hilariously (?) try to have conversations with George while he's sitting on the toilet; the commune leader is so fried from years of LSD that he is an hilarious (?) chore to talk to). As the comedian once said, \\"That joke's so old it can vote.\\"<br /><br />That's not to say it isn't done well. The actors nail nearly every scene, even if the lines seem pre-chewed. And there are a handful of refreshingly new additions to the line up, including a bit about a car in a lake, a nudist novelist, and a real estate agent who is unusually forthright about her personal life. But these are exceptions rather than the rule. The script is further muddied by Linda and George's constant flip-flopping on the whole hippie idea. Obviously, for the plot to work, one of them must love it and the other hate it, but those roles reverse mid-way through the movie, and for no immediately obvious reason other than that it must. The end result is that you can't tell who's being a stick-in-the-mud nor who is being blind to the less endurable realities of the whole hippie mindset. The movie doesn't really know how it feels about either side of the coin, and so it adopts a noncommittal attitude that makes the whole story feel ambivalent and overly-fake. It becomesless about a story, and more about an excuse to continue making jokes about finding the worst kind of hair in your homemade wine or people bringing placentas to breakfast.<br /><br />I laughed a decent amount, but I was bummed by the shrink-wrapped, assembly-line feel to the movie. With this much comedic talent working on a project, you'd expect, if nothing else, a little ingenuity (which is only briefly found in a few quick news segments) or risk. Instead, you have two people risking their entire livelihood in a story that, itself, takes no risks at all.less about a story, and more about an excuse to continue making jokes about finding the worst kind of hair in your homemade wine or people bringing placentas to breakfast.<br /><br />I laughed a decent amount, but I was bummed by the shrink-wrapped, assembly-line feel to the movie.

B0085P2Z6E|5.0|This game is a STEAL at the current price. I would honestly have paid more. This is a kick butt Hidden Object game purchased for my Kindle Fire. There are a few faults but I can overlook them because of how awesome the game is. So here goes!<br /><br />LIKES:<br />1. Storyline doesn't get in the way. I am not a Harry Potter fan, but the magic school thing works. I skipped it the 1st time through. I like that I didn't have to rely on the story to solve puzzles. I read it and it was interesting. The magical explanations are plausible.<br />2. This is a Hidden Object game that is exactly that. Roughly 3 puzzles per chapter. And predominantly finding hidden objects - imagine that. I absolutely hate HO games that are 30% finding objects and 70% solving lock puzzles, etc. So your task in any given level may be: find a list of different objects, find a number of the same objects, and complete a picture puzzle. I like jigsaw puzzles and was happily surprised by this. You may also be asked to spot the differences in two pictures or solve a memory card game. The last 2 tasks are fewer in between and keep the game interesting.<br />3. This game has lots of chapters. Into the 20's I believe.<br />4. This game plays amazingly well on the Kindle Fire. No force closing. No slowing down for whatever reason. It also saves your spot when you leave so that when you resume you start where you left off.<br />5. Good hint capabilities. You don't get excessive hints, but if you need more than 1 hint per room it's available.<br /><br />DISLIKES:<br />1. You can't zoom in. EVER. This sucked at times. The objects are well placed - no object sitting in a black shadow type of thing - but some of the items (like keys) are small and can be hard to see.<br />2. In the rooms with no light, the player is penalized for touching the screen to move the light around looking for items.  Fortunately, I believe this only happens twice in the whole game. But how about it, Mr. Game Manufacturer, can we getthis fixed?<br /><br />I can live with the above because the game is that awesome. If you buy this you won't be disappointed.

B003EVWDR0|3.0|In 1986 James Cameron released a movie called [[ASIN:B00012FXAE Aliens]] that sits on my Amazon Listmania List of Movies That Will Leave a Permanent Impression. Cameron has another movie on my list called [[ASIN:B000F9RB9Y The Terminator]]. You will not find Avatar on my List.<br /><br />Hey, great CGI does not a great movie make. And Avatar certainly has some of the greatest CGI that I've ever seen. But let me see if I've got this storyline correct: Basically there's this moon or planet inhabited by The Blue Humanoid People. The Blue People have hair-in-a-ponytail that can connect to various living organisms that literally connect their minds to the extent that The Blue People can control the organism; okay, kinda cool.<br /><br />But The Bad Humans (us) want to take over The Blue People's Moon/Planet/whatever in order to harvest some energy-rich resource. So The Bad Humans clone some Blue People, and via some magic machine that allows a human to take over the cloned Blue Person, The Bad Humans can put a spy into The Blue People's society in order to find out where they are and what they're up to. The human has to be asleep to take over the mind of the cloned Blue Person and the cloned Blue Person must be asleep whenever the human is awake. Okaaaayy.<br /><br />Now the really good part: When the cloned Blue Person is introduced to the Blue People's society, he is for all intents and purposes immediately accepted...to an extent. Then he becomes more accepted and as predictable as ever, likes being a Blue Person more than a human, turns double agent and of course gets himself some Blue Person tail (pun definitely intended).  Uh huh.<br /><br />And The Bad Humans get really bad: The leader of the expedition makes a decision in a vacuum outside whatever human government control there is, and as advanced as human civilization has become for whatever year this is supposed to be, is allowed to commit genocide on The Blue People with the help of a military-type commander that is even more extreme than the expedition leader. Ahhyyyye don't think so.<br /><br />Oh and by the way, they're gonna take 2 hours and 40 minutes to tell the story. But heck, what do I know? The movie was number 1 at the box office for weeks, and it was the number 1 selling DVD for weeks; and the movie was up for Oscars and stuff. And I'm another sucker, 'cuz I bought the Blu Ray version when it was first released. Ugh.<br /><br />Look, with all my sarcasm aside, it's a relatively good movie and I was moderately entertained.

B001DTUU7A|3.0|In the 1970 TV adaptation of Dr. Seuss' Horton Hears a Who, the Wickersham Brothers sang, \\"Rot! Rot! Rot! Rot! It's a plot! Plot! Plot! Plot!\\" A plot indeed. The directors of the 2008 \\"re-do\\" (not \\"re-make\\"; but I'll get to that in a minute) decided to remove most of the TV series' original music (and accompanying political undertones). Those dastardly, ghastardly, schnastardly schnooks!<br /><br />I mean, some of the most impressionable moments from the TV series were created by or during the music. But alas, freshmen Directors Steve Martino and Jimmy Hayward went with a more...what would one call it?...\\"a safe\\"...version of the 2008 re-do.<br /><br />The main story from the book (and TV series) is still fully intact in the 2008 movie. The story that has Horton the Elephant hearing voices from a dust-speck. Horton's point of view is that \\"a person's a person...no matter how small\\". But nay-sayers won't have their beliefs poisoned by the notion that there could be another society other than their own. So Horton finds himself an outcast.<br /><br />The new film seems to completely avoid the original book's 1954 political message, which was a mockery of McCarthyism and communist witch hunts of the time period. But in doing so, some of the enchantment of the TV movie was lost. Not enough so that viewers unfamiliar with the TV show--especially kids--won't enjoy the 2008 movie, but enough so that the 2008 re-do was pointless because it added nothing new to what was already solidly in place.<br /><br />Yes...I said \\"re-do\\" as opposed to \\"re-make\\". A re-make is when a director takes an old film, sometimes even a classic, and makes it *better*. A re-do is when a director takes a film and adds nothing to the original. The 2008 version of Horton is a re-do. Look, I'm not a big preservationist that thinks remaking good original movies should be taboo. I just think that a re-make should indeed be that...a re-make...not a re-do.<br /><br />People will remember the 2008 version of Horton for its rendition of REO Speedwagon's Can't Fight This Feeling. The essence of the movie was better surmised in 1970 when Thurl Ravenscroft sang \\"The Wickersham Brothers Song\\" (you might know Ravenscroft's voice better as the one that sang \\"You're A Mean One, Mr. Grinch\\" in 1966's How The Grinch Stole Christmas).<br /><br />So clearly, my recommendation is to stick with the original TV Horton. In fact, Amazon has a DVD package that not only gives you the original Horton, but also How The Grinch Stole Christmas ([[ASIN:B00004VVP9 How the Grinch Stole Christmas!/Horton Hears a Who]]).<br /><br />And remember, \\"it's not the size of the ship\\"...er...um...oops...wrong quote.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have a kindle fire and I love that you can do so much with this app. It is easy selecting your chapter along with the verses. I really like the fact that you can also take notes while reading. Something other apps don't supply. The only down fall is that you can't pull this app up without Internet.
0345803493|5.0|I thought the first book was okay, but its ending left me needing to read the second book. And I'm glad I did! James' writing improves tremendously with 50 shades darker. I liked that the book had more of a plot line and how we were able to see more into the characters, especially Christian Grey. I can not wait to read the third to see how the magic between Ana and Christian continues.

B004WCTLNY|3.0|Being a science fiction fan, I was intrigued by the premise of The Adjustment Bureau. The basic idea, that a shadow group is manipulating people according to their own plan or design, is not new in the sci fi genre (The Matrix, Inception, and Dark City are the first to mind). Or in political thrillers like The Manchurian Candidate. In this story, Matt Damon plays a politician, David Norris, who has just failed to win a senate seat from the great state of New York. He has a chance encounter with Emily Blunt's character, Elise, in the men's room of the hotel where he's about to give his concession speech. She inspires him to give a great, off-the-cuff speech about the artificiality of political campaigning and how he won't quit politics. He is presented as the quintessential honest politician. He's also the quintessential brash youth, who has gotten into a barroom brawl and other shenanigans that cost him the election.<br /><br />It turns out the titular Adjustment Bureau has been manipulating his life all along, including providing the \\"chance\\" encounter in the bathroom. Their plans are not immediately clear, other than they want him to be successful ultimately in politics. And they don't want he and Elise to meet again. They are a charming couple. Damon and Blunt have nice chemistry and the characters are well drawn enough to make the viewer root for them.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the Bureau itself is a bit of a let down. For all its seemingly omnipotence, omnipresence, and omniscience, is really rather inept, random, and unfocused. When people don't follow the Bureau's plans, they make little shifts (like spilling coffee to stop someone meeting) to get people to choose freely according to their plan. More than once in the movie, the Bureau guys miss their preplanned changes through incompetence or because they might interfere too much. While you certainly don't want overly competent or successful villains, their flaws and bumbles are so manifold, it's hard to believe they really are as sinister as they seem. When David first discovers that the Bureau exists and is altering people, there's no explanation how he can see the Bureau while all the \\"normal\\" people are frozen in time. Later, David challenges one of the Bureau's men on why they are keeping David and Elise apart. The guy has nothing to say in his own defense and David concludes that he doesn't know why. The guy is just following orders. Even when he talks to higher ups, the explanation makes little sense. The movie doesn't present the Bureau as really having its act together. They are just too ill defined and too easy to beat.<br /><br />It all seems a bit nonsensical, which made the movie disappointing for me. Especially since it is based on a Philip K. Dick story. I haven't read any of his books, but most of the movies based on his books (like Blade Runner, Minority Report, A Scanner Darkly, etc.) are interesting and intelligent. This movie promises to be both but does not deliver on either.
0307949486|4.0|I had a friend recommend this series. This friend had recommended other books and it seemed we had the same tastes so I figured I'd give this one a try as well. About 1/3 of the way into the book I started to wonder what I got myself into. The book seemed to drag, I was confused on who was who and it didn't seem to be going anywhere (at least not anywhere interesting). I started to wonder if I should just give up. It had taken me forever to get to this point and I really didn't want to waste time on a book I wouldn't enjoy. I decided to check out reviews on what other people thought of it. It seemed that half of them really disliked it and the other half loved it. I decided I'd go half way and if I didn't like it, I would put it down. All of the sudden things started picking up. I really got interested in it and I couldn't wait to see where it was going. I ended up enjoying this book and glad I stuck with it.<br />There are actually a lot of things going on in the book. They tend to tie in together nicely. On one hand you have Blomkvist who is in trouble for fraudulent journalism. On the other hand you have Salander, a misunderstood outcast who is just trying to get by on her own (and would do very well if she was just left alone). Blomkvist's trouble with the law has caused problems with the magazine he partially owns. When he is offered another job, he takes it in hopes that his absence from the magazine will help. He is hired by a elderly wealthy man by the name of Vanger. Vanger wants him to do research on the death of his niece, Harriet, who died 30 years ago. Even though Blomkvist doesn't think he'll find anything, he takes the job. Salander gets a job digging up all the info she can find on Blomkvist. Neither one really know each other but sooner or later they will.<br />I got so caught up in the unearthing of the death of Harriet that I totally forgot about all the other loose ends that were still hanging out there until that part ended and the book kept going. Glad I stuck with this book and look forward to reading the 2nd in the series.ng. Glad I stuck with this book and look forward to reading the 2nd in the series.
0670022950|5.0|I just finished this book.  It is long.  It will challenge you to read some of the descriptions of how humans have been historically violent toward humans.  But the message is positive and worth staying with to the end.<br /><br />If you have ever heard a sound bite or read an article that offers conclusions that left you wondering \\"Just how did they come up with that?\\", then you'll find Pinker's writing refreshing.  He quantifies and explains the background of every aspect of his argument about declining violence.  With every digression he comes back to the main branch from which he diverted and pulls it together with a summary that reminds the reader of where we were and why we diverted.<br /><br />I recommend this book.  I found it to be one of the most intelligently written books I've read.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What I liked most about the book was how orginial the story was (At least I have not read anything like it).  He also did an excellent job in character building. I really felt like I knew these people in the book. After reading this book I had to take a 3 day break from reading, just so I can have a free mind to start another book. The book was just that good! He has laid a very good foundation with the first 6 books in the series and I hope he plans on creating more.
B002KYHZLQ|1.0|I bought this book based on the many reviews that I read on here.  I got through about 125 pages and I still couldn't figure out what was going on.  There is no explanation of the magic system.  No explanation of the characters.  No explanations what so ever.  I like reading for enjoyment.  I love complex plots.  And I love lots of characters.  But at some point, I do need some things explained to me.  Things like, who these people are.  What are their sources of power?  What can they do with this power?  None of this is explained in the parts of the book that I've read.<br /><br />This is the first book in a VERY long time that I've shelved (archived on my Kindle) and haven't completed.  I read another review that said the first book is ok, but to really get to the plot and figure things out, I have to get to book 2.  NO thanks.  I don't believe that I need to read an entire book and get into a second book just to understand some of the comings and goings of the characters.<br /><br />This book may be a fine read for someone smarter than myself.  So my recommendation is that if you're looking for something overly complex and something that you'll need to figure out, then this book is for you.  But, if your'e like me and like a little more light reading for enjoyment, look elsewhere.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Can't wait for the next Baldacci novel!  This writer knows how to carry a story and stick to the facts while keeping his readers on edge all along!
B005LAIGQ4|5.0|1988 Barrow Point, Alaska.<br /><br />This film is based on a true story and includes news feeds from that era. Three migrating whales are trapped in the ice due to early freezing. It was a fluke they were reported on in the first place. Once attention grew, unlikely forces and alliances came together to save the whales. This included an oil company, Greenpeace, US and Soviet governments, the military, Eskimos, the community, private entrepreneurs, and a Barbie reporter. That was the Big Miracle.<br /><br />The film contains the right mix of drama and comedy in this heart warming tale on what people can accomplish when they come together.<br /><br />The end of the film shows a clip of Sarah Palin, then Heath, as a sportscaster.<br /><br />Family safe.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I hadn't heard of Firefly until my friend introduced it to me this year. After a few weeks of watching all of the episodes and Serenity, I am now obsessed with the show. I wish it hadn't been cancelled! For anyone who wants a funny, action packed series, Firefly is definitely the perfect choice!
B004UHSB5A|4.0|Plays nice, but hard to manage when you get a lot of bones from the boneyard.  They seem to add to the list opposite of what I expect too.  Seems kind of forced getting bones and then doesn't allow you to draw when not needed, so might as well draw from boneyard for you and save some steps.  Dominoes are really tiny on a big screen and could stretch when needed.  Dragging is a little off and hard to get used to.  Since this is something easy to do I'm guessing they designed it that way so you can see the dominoe you are dragging otherwise your finger would cover it up.  Takes some getting used to for remembering to place the dominoe and not your finger where you want it.  Could really use a point counter for current board values like Yahoo does...I know it removes the need to think and do math which kind of defeats the purpose, but you still have to calculate what you have would make a multiple of 5 and the game would go quicker.  A network/multiplayer version of Train Dominoes would be really cool like this.
B0086700CM|4.0|Temple Run is an entertaining and quick paced game. You won't want to stop playing. Getting chased by demon monkeys, jumping, sliding, turning, the works. It also has an available option to &quot;buy&quot; power-ups for the game. My personal favorite is the wings that allow you to come back to life if you accidentally die. I only have one suggestion for the game makers are to have a sooner ending and different courses. I enjoy the app Temple Run.

B006M7JCC2|5.0|\\"It was as though every moment held infinite possibilities, and where I was at that point in time was a culmination of every decision, every choice, and every thought of my entire life. My many fears and my great power had manifested as this disease.\\"<br /><br />When I read this paragraph in Anita Moorjani's book \\"[[ASIN:B006M7JCC2 Dying to Be Me: My Journey from Cancer, to Near Death, to True Healing]]\\" it reminded me of what we often say to participants in [[ASIN:B0030AF5HK A Course In Miracles ((Original Edition))]]] study groups. It was the next sentence in that paragraph that stopped my mind for a moment: \\"My many fears and my great power had manifested as this disease.\\"<br /><br />What did Anita mean by this? Why would our POWER manifest as a disease?<br /><br />In 2002 Anita was diagnosed with cancer. Since conventional, western style medicine had not helped her friend who perished, Anita tried alternative methods:<br /><br />\\"I tried faith healing, praying, meditation, and energy-healing sessions. I read every book I could get my hands on about cancer.. I worked on forgiveness therapy, and forgave everyone I knew-then forgave them again. I traveled through India and China, meeting Buddhist monks, Indian yogis, and enlightened masters.. I tried being vegan, meditating on mountaintops, yoga, ayurveda, chakra balancing, Chinese herbal medicine, pranic healing, and Chi Gong. But despite all this, my cancer just kept getting worse.\\" (Kindle Edition p. 133).<br /><br />It was at the point of imminent total organ failure, after a four year battle, that Anita's fight was over. She completely surrendered to - what turned out to be - REALITY.<br /><br />In this amazing book, DYING TO BE ME, Anita chronicles her life before her diagnosis in Part I, Part II chronicles her journey to death and back and Part III is an expression of Anita's understanding of \\"healing, the way the world is today, and how we can live as a reflection of who we really are, allowing our magnificence to shine through.\\"<br /><br />When the end came, and Anita finally let go completely she took the leap of faith, and was buoyed up by the LOVE that she knew herself to BE.

B004IJZFP4|5.0|The title is misleading. This is no remastered version of the original album. As far as I know the original reels are still lost.<br />But:<br />Here we have a great album with alternate outtakes of the original TEASER songs. Really extraordinary versions with brillant guitar and great vocals.<br />But these are no really demo's because the sound is no garage sound. Sometimes the vocals could be a more in front - but it is very hot produced album.<br />All versions are VERY different to the original version some of them are much longer and show the quality of the great late Tommy Bolin.<br />This is no ersatz for the original album but a very exciting addition.<br />Something which Bolin and guitar fans should not miss....<br />If this would be the a double CD with the original album and these outtakes it would be something like a holy grail.<br />I very thankful, that the Bolin family shared these jewels with the fans.

Otherwise, the Aliens would had won and conquered within the first few hours after landing.<br /><br />Somehow, the aliens wanted to fight the humans in the old fashion battleship game situation.<br /><br /> -Why in the world would they do that?<br /><br /> -I don't know, but they thought it was a good idea...<br /><br /> -That's stupid!<br /><br />But, we need to move on or the movie would just stop, period. The aliens won't fire on the humans unless, they fired first. Stupid again, but we need to move on or the movie would just stop. Somehow the main male lead and his crew mates can't get killed. Of course, everyone else is getting blown up with the ship, but these guys managed to find 3 boats to keep on living and trying. This thing should had been a comedy. lol<br /><br />Also, the aliens must had been really, really stupid at the end of the movie. They were able to take out previous so many new, high-tech, bigger destroyer ships, but this old relic, battleship, \\"the dinosaur,\\" is able to live on and fight the aliens! What???<br /><br />Then, instead of just firing at the battleship at the start, the aliens actually waited to see what the old dinosaur would do??? Bull crap!!!<br /><br />Why doesn't the aliens just fire at it when it started moving? Who in the right mind would just let an enemy advantage towards them in a full frontal attack position? A super intelligent being would hadjust shot at it and blow it up and be done it with it already. Heck, even the humans would had done that. Full on advances, and zero gun fire what so ever. Come on!!! This really is a comedy!<br /><br />Hell, that battleship could had been destroy back at the dock!<br /><br />Don't tell me their guns can't reach that far to shot at the enemy! The Aliens' guns can shot all the way to Hawaii and beyond!!! That's thousands of feet away. So, don't tell me they can't shoot some hundreds feet away, because that's just BS!<br /><br />This movie doesn't make any sense. And should be burn to ashes! Don't waste your time with this one. You won't like it-unless you just in it for the special effects, which aren't that great either. Go see Transformers, it's the same special effects.

B007B5EDEG|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed every single book in the series, and particularly enjoyed the personalities involved, each very human and absolutely believable. When one character didn't appear for a while, I found myself really wondering how they were getting on.  The division of the books into sections devoted to each of the main players works really well, keeping the narrative moving and cohesive without any of the confusion that sometimes happens when an author simply moves to another portion of the story without warning.  It's light, enjoyable reading at its best if you're a fantasy fan as I am.
030758836X|2.0|I have never written a review on Amazon, but my disappointment in this book and confusion over all the positive reviews compelled me to. Gillian Flynn is a fabulous writer. I thought Sharp Objects was a great debut. I did not enjoy Dark Places, not because the writing was any less wonderful, but because the main character was very unappealing to me. After hearing such wonderful things about Gone Girl, I was excited to read it.<br />Part 1 was slow paced, but it kept my interest. Parts 2 and 3 quickly veered into ridiculous. And the ending was so disappointing. I am very very tired of being promised a \\"shocking ending\\", only to spend days reading a book and find a terrible ending. I'm not saying a writer shouldn't leave you wanting more, asking questions, feeling unsatisfied. But this type of ending has now become trendy, and writers seem to go with the trend, instead of what is the best end for their particular story. I wasn't left wanting more OR asking questions. I was left annoyed and very confused by the hype.

Getting back to Young & Hazel, I don't give a rip about how fast a guy can move his fingers. I just care what the music does to me.

B003O86FMW|3.0|This book was alright.  The first was so good which is why I bought it, however it really lacked the detail of the first book and seemed like it was written as an after-thought.  Spoiler:  The ending is a cliffhanger so be ready to buy the last one if you read this one.

B007U1FEJE|5.0|I want to add my voice to the chorus of voices applauding the new Beach Boys CD.  The title track has those delightful high wispy vocals that can lift your spirits into the stratosphere.  \\"Isn't It Time\\" bounces so cheerfully that it puts a permanent smile on your face with the sweet chorus, \\"Isn't it time we danced the night away; How about doing it just like yesterday?\\"  Mike Love's \\"Daybreak Over the Ocean\\" has that classic Beach Boys build with a tender lyric, \\"As day breaks over the ocean, moonlight still on the sea, I pray the waves' gentle motion will bring my baby to me.\\"  My personal favorite track is \\"Strange World\\" with Brian Wilson's lovely marriage of melody & lyric, \\"I can't imagine how life would be if you weren't here with me.\\"  \\"From There to Back Again\\" is one of those tracks that will join so many of the Beach Boys' classics among their best work.  The tensions and shifts in tempo with those lovely harmonies is entrancing.  The set concludes with the gentle reflective \\"Summer's Gone.\\"  The unabashed brilliance of the set is as unexpected as it is obvious.  This is a CD not to be missed!  Bravo!
030758836X|3.0|Gillian Flynn is a very talented writer. Her potential shows in each of her three novels. I loved Sharp Objects. I was not wild about Dark Places as a matter of personal preference, not because of any lack of writing talent as much as that I did not feel drawn to the characters, but I respect the work. I am disappointed in Gone Girl. Ms. Flynn has a clear talent for sharp and often witty prose, as well as a very vivid imagination. With Gone Girl, however, I felt she tried a bit too hard. The novel is divided into three sections. Section One introduces the main plot, and juxtaposes the two protagonists in back-to-back tellings of their respective versions of events, alternating one chapter for each. I found this a very effective tool to introduce some confusion and doubt regarding who exactly to believe, as well as some insight into how we all can miscommunicate with each other. His story, Her story, and the Truth. The Second section takes a radical turn, increasing the tension developed in the First section even more. A very neat trick, very inventive. The overreaching, in my opinion, begins to occur in the Third section. Plot lines become stretched, and the characters start to feel made up rather than real; the whole thing begins to feel unbelievable. The final summation of the book takes a new twist past the plot line itself and into the psychology of relationships, and this is where I felt the novel really fell apart. I had the feeling Ms. Flynn, a gifted writer, had run into a serious case of writer's block somewhere about two-thirds into this novel, and just began to punt. She seemed to try to outdo herself with twists and turns that began to lack a sense of authenticity. Inventiveness turned into contrivance. The issues that shaped Sections One and Two suddenly were resolved, and there began a departure into something new, but I did not feel satisfied that the mysteries presented in Sections One and Two had been satisfactorily concluded as much as forced to ending. My advise to Ms. Flynn for (hopefully) some future novel, if I could offer my advise, would be to keep it simple and not try to be clever and overreach with incessant twists and sudden jumps into new terrain. Better to finish one story well than to over-complicate with too much novelty.<br />I can not say I disliked this book. The first two sections kept me coming back for more. I wish it had stayed on course the entire time instead of veering into new waters at the end.<br /><br />************************** WARNING - SPOILER ALERT **************************<br /><br />The alternating voices of Nick and Amy really kept me guessing as to who was telling the more reliable version of the truth through the entire first section.<br />The opening paragraphs of the second section stunned me, and I found myself rereading them a few times to make sure I was getting it right. Having Adorable Amy transform into Psycho Amy this way was a shocker, and added energy to the story.<br />Disbelief began in the third section with Amy's return. The mystery element was now gone. We had been told all through section two that Amy had invented the entire frame-up, but this still left room for a sudden twist to occur where, we might have been told, it wasn't that at all, it REALLY was something ELSE, had Ms. Flynn chosen to take that path. But she didn't. Instead, we were presented with the necessary, and forced, pseudo-reconciliation between Nick and Amy. We were not informed of any police work into the truthfulness of Amy's story. Apparently the police were too embarrassed to do any further work after falsely accusing Nick in sections one and two. Not very believable. For all the work put into constructing the frame-up in the first two sections, there was almost no work put into making Amy's story seem really believable both to the cops and to the public. Everyone just seemed to accept her word at face value, period end. The descent into the psychology of dysfunction in relationships at the conclusion of this third section would have been better suited for a new, different novel, than as the ending of this one. There was just too much ground to cover, psychologically speaking, and considering the level of dysfunction being as high as it was (read: psychopathic) to simply brush it all to perfection in a final rushed section. I found this ending the most disappointing part of the book, not for its theme of dysfunction, but because it simply did not belong here in this book, much less as its resolution and conclusion. I felt a real lack of closure when I had finished. A strong storyline had been abandoned, and a premise for a new and complex discussion of relationships and human nature was not given its due.
B005HSL626|4.0|This game is very fun and all, but all the adds that pop up kind of ruin it. I mean come on, do you really want to be interrupted by some add about another game while you are trying to cut a watermelon in half? I didn't think so. Over all, this game is fun to play with, but it could use less adds.
1936608898|5.0|As a coach and personal trainer I have used the author's Whole 30 program with hundreds of clients.  They have achieved great results.  However, everyone always wants a resource they can send home to their families or give to their friends and co-workers.  After reading all of the books in this genre I had not yet found a text I could recommend.<br /><br />Until now the choices were fairly limited, in my opinion.  Most of the other books about healthy unprocessed food, dare I write \\"paleo\\", have the following problems:  1) They are either too full of jargon. 2) They are written in conversational language that I cannot recommend to my mom.  3) They lack clear implementation details.<br /><br />\\"It Starts With Food\\" does not suffer from these problems.  It is easy to read yet still contains the details and reference if you want to dig deeper.  The tone is conversational, making it quick to read, but it is polished and professional.  Finally, the book and the accompanying website contain all the implementation details you could want.<br /><br />Finally, this is the only book in this genre that clearly explains the psychological component of food and why it is so difficult to stop making poor food choices without going cold turkey.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to those already familiar with a \\"paleo\\" style of eating and to anyone you want to share this healthy lifestyle with.<br /><br />Chris Brown<br />RKC, CSCS

1401235417|5.0|Over the years and throughout the world, Batman has been perhaps the most important and successful comic book character of all time. With a over a thousand issues of various Batman titles as well as a slew of television programs, both live-action and animated, and also some films varying in degrees of critical and financial success, it seems that people seem to prefer their Batman to be a darker hero; a character of gravity and potency rather than just a cartoony beat-up-the-bad-guys superhero. This has shown just within the last few years with the gigantic success, both financially and critically, of Christopher Nolan's THE DARK KNIGHT (which I regard as the greatest comic book film of all time) as well as the brilliant run of this book's author, Scott Snyder, on DETECTIVE COMICS, with premier artists such as Jock and Francesco Francavilla. This was a run that rivaled that of Frank Miller and David Mazzuchelli during the 1987 arc called \\"Year One\\", which many regard as not just one of the very best Batman stories but one of the best comic books ever written, period.<br /><br />Now, we have the launch of DC's NEW 52 initiative, which was designed to bring most characters back to a point where any person off the street could pick up these issues and not have to have read years of continuity to connect with the characters. The success of this has been pretty significant, not only from a reader standpoint but also from a monetary standpoint, which personally I think was more responsible for the changes made. And with giving Snyder another Batman book, and pairing him with a brilliant artist like Greg Capullo (who cut his teeth on Image Comics series like SPAWN and HAUNT), this first collected arc is among the very best comics currently has to offer.<br /><br />The whole opening of this series is something breathtaking to behold as far as demonstrating what a superior fighter and strategist that Batman is as we see most of the major inmates of Arkham Asylum breaking out and Batman takes them all down. It's a genius opening to the series, setting the bar very high for all that's coming. Back at Wayne Manor, the recently-returned Bruce Wayne (Don't ask... it's just a huge headache thanks to the insane machinations of Grant Morrison) is jumping back into the improvement of Gotham City with both feet. Unfortunately, just underneath those feet is a killer on the loose that seems to be using the guise of \\"The Court of Owls\\", a scary old wives' tale about Gotham that seems to be as old as the city itself. And even more unfortunate for Batman/Bruce Wayne is that The Court of Owls is quite real, and they have sent masked assassins called Talons to kill a new mayoral candidate of Gotham as well as Bruce, who they know to be Batman. The near-invulnerability of the Talons end up taking their toll on Batman and he is brought deep underground to the lair of The Court to stand trial for his life and for control of Gotham.<br /><br />The absolute genius of Snyder and Capullo's work on this title is in just about every level. Firstly, one of the things that Snyder understands about Batman is that he is not a rich guy with  a scary suit who fights bad guys with his fists. This is something that comes about too often with writers on Batman. He is more than a force of nature; he's also considered the world's greatest  detective, and that's something that Snyder is keenly aware of. The gadgetry he uses in the issues, such as a contact lens that interfaces with his computer for facial recognition and a holographic camera that allows for a remote post-mortem examination are very inspired. The action set pieces are inspired as well, as a fight between a non-suited-up Wayne and one of the Talons on one of Gotham's tallest structures displays.<br /><br />The main focus of the book is not necessarily Batman's fighting prowess or his detective skills. The existence of the Court of Owls strike at the very nature of who Batman has seen himself to be all theseyears. He considers himself Gotham's guardian and its keeper. He knows its streets and rooftops and alleys and sewers. He knows Gotham better than anyone, but the Court proves that there are still many more secrets within Gotham and that perhaps the power to know more of those secrets removes the power that Batman believed he had over Gotham, and also further delves into the past of Gotham and its founders, much as Snyder and Kyle Higgins did in BATMAN: GATES OF GOTHAM. It's a descent into the darkest depths of Gotham's very soul, and once confronted, like Campbell's HEART OF DARKNESS or the Nietzsche-ian abyss, it changes Bruce, making this book about a psychological attack as well as a physical one.<br /><br />The supporting cast here is also very strong as we see characters that have their own book, particularly Nightwing and especially Alfred, but also the characters of Commisioner Gordon and even Bruce's son Damian has a moment that is as strong and emotionally charged as anything else in the book. What Snyder also understands is that another supporting character and one of Batman's most significant strengths (or weaknesses) is Gotham City itself. They recognize it being as vital to the character as any other of his supporting cast.<br /><br />From an art standpoint, this is one of the best-drawn books on the shelves right now. Capullo's style seems to be a strange but wonderful hybrid of the design style of Bruce Timm and the dynamics of Todd McFarlane. His attention to detail is extremely strong and he really knows how to construct a page. The most bravura storytelling the series has yet to offer is the fifth issue, contained within this trade, which tells part of the story of Batman being lost and totally disoriented in the maze of the Court of Owls, but the other storytelling comes from the way that Capullo not only frames each moment but actually requires you to rotate the pages once it gets to a certain point as the confusion and the disorientation Batman is experiencing becomes the reader's to share. It's something that you honestly wouldn't expect from a mainstream comic (especially from DC's most popular character), but it works incredibly well and is my favorite issue of the series thus far.<br /><br />During Scott Snyder's run on DETECTIVE COMICS as well as his continuing work on the great AMERICAN VAMPIRE, he shows how well he understands not only the characters he's working with, but also the surroundings they're in and the commitment to construct a brilliantly serialized story. Each issue makes you come back for more, and it's not just because of the many cliffhangers this comic provides, but because he gives you characters to care about and to learn about. This is the same sensibility he has also brought to the other New 52 series he's currently doing, SWAMP THING, and that couldn't be more highly recommended as well.<br /><br />Scott Snyder and Greg Capullo working together here is one of the few examples of a perfect marriage of writing and art on a comic, and this first volume of their run together on BATMAN is everything you want from these characters and more.years. He considers himself Gotham's guardian and its keeper. He knows its streets and rooftops and alleys and sewers.

B005LAIHSG|4.0|\\"Snow White and the Huntsman\\" is not the Walt Disney version of the popular fairy tale.  This is a dark, gritty reimagining of the legend, in which Snow White's stepmother Ravenna murders the King, usurps the throne, and locks up the young Snow White in a tower.  The new Queen (Charlize Theron) sustains herself by absorbing the youth and beauty of young women, instantly aging them, while the whole kingdom takes on a deathly pallor.<br /><br />The audience meets a now grown Snow White (Kirsten Stewart) clinging to her faith in a filthy, freezing and lonely cell in a tower.  She manages to escape when the Queen's brother attempts to molest her.  She runs for her life in a dark forest, pursued by the Queen's henchmen, and by a huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) who ends up being an uncertain ally.<br /><br />Magic is a key theme of the movie, whether the evil variety used so skillfully by the Queen, or the good magic exercised, sometimes unconsciously, by Snow White.  Snow White will survive a terrifying journey through the dark forest to an enchanted portion where she comes to understand her own powers.  Thus fortified, she will rally her father's remaining loyal subjects for a dramatic confrontation with the Queen.<br /><br />\\"Snow White\\" is a surprisingly entertaining movie.  The special effects are good to excellent, and Charlize Theron steals the movie, managing to portray a rounded character despite her necessary status as the villainess of the story.  There is some good location shooting around Britain and Ireland, and the supporting cast has lots of solid British actors behind the beards and underneath the armor.  The final duel between Snow White and the evil Queen is quite suspenseful, even though we think we know how it is supposed to turn out.  Recommended as good entertainment, but not for little kids.
B007K3JFUQ|1.0|Unfortunately... I have to add my lumps as well as the majority of other reviewers. The Motion picture industry continues to drive a wedge between themselves and the buyer by instituting things like this. Even digital copy rights are rediculous, due to the fact that you can only download one version to one type of device (either WMV for windows based players, or Quicktime for Apple). This Ultraviolet thing takes it one step further.<br /><br />In my humble opinion... When honest buyers aren't afforded the benefit of having there own personal copy to share between members of the same household, you run the risk of them just going to get it illegally. If you want pirating to stop... stop doing crap like this. The music industry seems to have gotten the point.<br /><br />Remember when they tried to make CDs \\"unripable\\" by encripting them. All it did was irritate the person buying it, because they couldn't play it on their MP3 device. Really short sited folks. DUMB!!!!
B000J103OI|5.0|Both actresses Anne Hathaway & Meryl Streep do it again yet in this awesome movie about the world of fashion. Meryl Streep plays the big head honcho Miranda Priestly of Runway Magazine in which is like an icon to women over half of the world who worship fashion unlike Andrea (Hathaway), who has no sense of fashion yet in halfway into this movie you see her change her clothes and her entire new look and she sort of breaks up with her boyfriend as well but honestly its a great movie seeing how one changing their entire outlook on life just from a glamourous job being the assistant of Miranda Priestly. Honestly i adore this movie and got it for my mother for her birthday since i own this movie yet i had my mom ask to watch it so she had to borrow it yet im glad i got it for her.

B005HJWWW8|5.0|Fiio E5 at loud volumes distorted the mids and highs while listening on my ATHM50 headphones.<br /><br />Fiio E6 on the other hand didn't distort at all. In-fact while listening to music using E6 at high volumes I can hear things in familiar songs I didn't hear before. Songs sound more active. I use the flat setting BTW.<br /><br />The E6 isn't a small improvement in sound quality over the E5 but a BIG improvement.<br /><br />I have the E6 plugged into my iMac 24/7 using the USB port and there isn't any sound coming from the amp when the music is at a low point. None at all.<br /><br />I wanted to hear my music at a slightly higher volume on my iMac while not having any distortion and the E6 allows me to do that.
0385344228|4.0|Andy, a district attorney, and wife Laurie are the parents of 14 yr old Jacob, an intelligent but somewhat unpopular kid amongst his peers.  One of his classmates is found stabbed to death, and soon after Jacob is charged with his murder.  Andy and Laurie are naturally devastated, but they love their son, and believe in his innocence (mostly), so they devote themselves to obtaining the best defense for Jacob and to trying to maintain some sense of normalcy in their home life before and during the trial.<br /><br />I found this novel to be very slow going.  It's narrated by the father, Andy, and too many words are spent detailing every family dinner, meetings with Jacob's attorney, meetings with Jacob's psychologist, trial transcripts, etc, etc.  I listened to the audiobook of this novel.  For me, that's important, because I tend to have more patience with a book that starts out slowly if I'm listening to it rather than reading it, since I'm a captive listener in my car.  Had I been reading it, I'd probably have given up after a few chapters.<br /><br />But I'm glad I didn't, because there was a big payoff in the end, with an ending I won't soon forget.<br /><br />So I'd give it 3 1/2 stars, due to the strength of the ending, which delivered a 1-2-3 punch.

B00356CO1E|4.0|This is my 4th day of level 1 of jillian michael's 30 day shred. i've never worked out in a gym before, i've only done some other on demand workouts plus walking my dog outside. i am starting at 5'9\\" and about 145 lbs. this workout is definitely a challenge and will leave you sweating if you give it your all. there are no breaks or rests which is why it claims such great results. you do 3 minutes of strength, 2 minutes of cardio and 1 minute of abs. the moves are pretty simple, such as pushups, lunges, butt kicks and crunches, but they really get the job done. almost all of the actions engage your core so you end of with more than 3 minutes of working your abs. i'm still sore after the workout, i've been doing it about every other day, and i can definitely feel myself getting stronger. i would recommend this workout to beginners looking for something to do in the home, because all you need are dumbbells and a mat. good luck!

B005LAIHXQ|1.0|I gave this film one star only because Amazon wouldn't let me post this review with a zero star rating. I am embarrassed for Ridley Scott. Either he has completely lost his touch or feels such an abiding contempt for his audience that he could not be bothered to make a good movie. Prometheus is among the worst collection of disjoint false starts, unkept promises, and unmotivated action to appear on the screen this century. I have no idea how many writers actually worked on the script, but it is clear that they never spoke to each other. I would characterize Prometheus as a multi-million dollar work of mediocre fan fiction clumsily based on the movie Alien. About twenty minutes into the film I caught myself looking for the slide bar at the bottom of the screen, only to remember that I was actually in a theater. This film may be why space is a vacuum, and anyone who likes movies should hope that no sequel of this jumble of mismatched cliches and set pieces is ever made.
B007P06DOK|1.0|The 25th Anniversary remaster is a victim of the loudness war that is killing the dynamic range of modern music. The compression of the dynamic range has made this remastered CD nearly unlistenable. The title track on the original 1986 release has a dynamic range of 13, while the same track on the 25th Anniv. remaster has been squashed to 7. The openness is gone and individual instruments are all at the same level: LOUD. This might be fine for dance music, but not for Paul Simon. Remaster engineer Greg Calbi of Sterling Sound can do incredible work, but this isn't one of them. Also, I don't own the 2004 Rhino remaster, so I can't compare it. All in all, my advice is to stick to the 1986 CD release.
B0079J28NW|5.0|This is a review of the 2012 Blu-Ray release of Yellow Submarine, not a movie review (you can find those elsewhere all over the web).  This is the complete movie, as was the 1999 release.  Just to compare; this release was visually at least as much of an improvement over the 1999 release as that release was over all of it's predecessors, if not more.  Not surprising since the entire film was cleaned and repaired manually cell by cell.<br /><br />MOVIE VIDEO: The picture is so nice it is hard to believe.  Having only seen the movie on the various home video releases over the last 25 or so years, I have never seen this movie look this good.  I know how bright the colors in various stills and even the 1968 comic book were, but I had no idea that the movie colors actually matched or even surpassed that vividness.  All of the animation looked perfect. The only flaws I could find (specifically looking for flaws, that is) were a very few occasional wobbles in some standing images and the only light pixilation on the entire disk was during the gradient fade up from black during sunrise in Liverpool leading into Eleanor Rigby.  To me, that is absolutely acceptable.  The actual Beatle footage at he end was still a bit grainy, but I consider that to be very acceptable as well.  There is only so much that can be done with poor quality filmstock of live action, at least at this time, and this portion still looks just fantastic compared to any other release of Yellow Submarine.<br /><br />MOVIE AUDIO:  The 5.1 and mono mixes themselves sound exactly the same as the 1999 release, but both are now lossless audio.  I don't know if they did any new tweaking or reworking for this release or not, but it sounds as grand as you would expect a Beatles product to sound, and both sound very clean and crisp.  I have not listened to the running movie commentary at all yet.<br /><br />BONUS FEATURES: All of the 1999 release features are here.  The interview footage looks pretty poor, having been recorded on video in the pre-HD days.  However; all of the bonus feature animation footage, including the entire original trailer and all the animation in the \\"Mod Odyssey\\" documentary, has been cleaned so the quality matches that of the movie.  As for new features; as listed on the packaging there are three storyboard sequences, two of which are alternate scenes from very early pre-production.  This is especially nice because we can finally see the story around The Beatles riding the birds dropped clip that was in the above mentioned Mod Odyssey documentary.  Sadly, that the snippet in Mod Odyssey seems to be the only existing footage of this, as no more was included here.  There are also some original pencil drawings and behind the scenes photos which are interesting to fanatics like me.<br /><br />PACKAGING: Cardboard - digipack style packaging.  I am not a fan of this style because it is so hard to keep these in good shape over time with normal handling and shelf-ware, but overall it does look very nice.  Glad to have almost the original poster design back as the cover, but in person it looks a bit dark (not as clean and bright looking as the picture here on Amazon).  Not a big deal to me, only making an observation, but it is very noticeable.  The booklet is very nice with additional photos and artwork and some international poster art shown.  There are also some reproduction cells of each of The Beatles and a small page of stickers.  Very nice little extras for a standard edition.<br /><br />OVERALL: if you are a fan of this movie, this is an unquestionable must for your collection.  Unlike most re-releases, this is worth every cent of re-purchase.en recorded on video in the pre-HD days.

1936608898|5.0|Simply put, the Whole30 program changed my life. Suffice to say, I battled food for my entire adolescence and early adulthood. In the battle of me vs. scale, food was the ultimate enemy. A few years ago I was introduced to Paleo and though I did a decent job implementing it, I still couldn't commit 100% until I found the Whole9 and did my first Whole30. So yes, I'm one of those people who has had physical ailments clear up and who finally has a sane relationship with food and my body. What's awesome about It Starts with Food is that it combines the Whole30 together with other concepts-new and old-from Melissa and Dallas's blog/seminar and caps it off with some great recipes (because in the end...it's really about the food, isn't it?!).<br /><br />So without further adieu, 5 reasons you need to read ISWF...<br /><br />#1: It's the perfect mix of science and practical application.<br /><br />I'll admit, I like to nerd out on science books. Truth. In ISWF, the Hartwigs provide enough techy goodness to satisfy the left side of anyone's brain while telling us how to put the concepts of the Whole9-foods that make us less and more healthy-into action. From a primer in the major hormones involved in digestion and energy regulation to the details of managing inflammation and gut health, this book is chock full of information and leaves no stone unturned. At the same time, Dallas and Melissa don't hang the reader out to dry feeling lost in a sea of \\"science-y\\" stuff...they devote a huge portion of the book to answering the \\"So what?\\" questions that come up like, So if dairy makes us less healthy, how do we get our calcium? and the like. I loved that they give the reader the option of, \\"If you don't care about the science and just want to know what to eat, how much to eat...skip straight to the food in Chapter 8.\\" They get it...not everyone wants the science but for those of us who do, we are indulged! There's also extensive reference section with numerous primary sources cited.<br /><br />#2: It addresses the psychological aspect of food.<br /><br />How many of us, at some point in our lives, have felt the following about eating/bodyweight/body composition: guilt, frustration, anger, hopelessness, plagued with uncontrollable habits despite wanting to change? I'm envisioning hands raising all across the globe. I have run across no other food book that addresses these concepts in as succinct a way as Melissa and Dallas have in ISWF. In fact, it's so central to the story that it appears in the fourth chapter and is interwoven throughout the rest of the book. They describe how modern processed food-appropriately termed \\"food with no brakes\\"-makes our brains addicted and shapes our habits in ways that we aren't even consciously aware of. ISWF also delves into the social aspects of food and how we treat the process of mealtime. Instead of just telling us what to eat, they challenge the reader to think about how to connect to food again instead of just shoveling it in animal-style.<br /><br />#3: It is realistic.<br /><br />The Hartwigs realize that at some point, everyone who reads ISWF/does a Whole30/cleans up their diet can't stay in perfect lock-step forever (and who would want to?). People aren't robots! How do we transition from ISWF as an awareness tool and framework to something that is sustainable for life?! Luckily, the book delves into this subject and provides the reader with strategies for determining how to continue their newfound healthy way of eating (let's all agree to stop using the word \\"diet\\" okay?!). Also, they've included a huge section devoted to special populations like diabetics, pregnant women and athletes and their individual considerations because context matters. As an athlete, I particularly appreciated the post-workout carb refueling chart and how to handle the pre-workout meal. Despite having done a couple Whole30s of my own, I feel like this book will still be a desk reference that I revisit frequently for motivation and inspiration as I go on my own journey.<br /><br />#4: It's entertaining and fun to read.<br /><br />Having been fortunate enough to hang out with Melissa and Dallas in person and interact with them via the Web, I can say that this book sounds like them and is true to their message. They're notoriously witty, and ISWF is no exception. The book blends some classic zingers and tough love lines with enough motivation and positivity to get you through. Anyone who's read about the Whole30 before no doubt remembers, \\"Please don't tell us this program is hard. Quitting heroin is hard. Beating cancer is hard. Birthing a baby is hard. Drinking your coffee black. Is. Not. Hard.\\" When you read down to the bottom of the page you see, \\"You can do this\\" in bold letters.  It's like a kick in the pants followed by a hug and then getting a belly laugh all at the same time. The Hartwigs, in typical good educator fashion, use lots of analogies to explain tricky concepts: your body as a nightclub, the immune system like firefighters, and my personal favorite...processed edibles \\"like the Las Vegas Strip of foods\\". Hilarious and relatable all at the same time.<br /><br />#5: It's got recipes for amazing food.<br /><br />ISWF has a huge appendix of positively drool-worthy eats (which is no surprise because the ever-incredible Melissa Joulwan of Well Fed and The Clothes Make the Girl is behind it all). In case you didn't know, I'm a huge Mel fan and her cookbook has permanent residency in my kitchen. The Meal Map is brilliant and contains several Master Recipes...think of them like the Mr. Potato Head of recipes: the same basic structure but a zillion variations all in neat chart form. I read through the section and literally said, \\"Why didn't I think of this?!\\" It's simple enough for someone brand spankin' new to Whole30/Paleo while also giving an old-timer like me some new kitchen inspiration. Even if you are an old pro at eating this way, I guarantee you'll find something newto try (and love)!

B005L38QK2|4.0|Its a great mouse and I love the way it feels during use. The mouse doesn't feel too cheap and is a nice fit for my hand. This mouse as a hardware piece is great and all but the software from the steelseries site has quite a few bugs that are quite bad. For starters the software can sometimes cause the computer to not fully start up and cause a lot of random glitching until a forced restart. Second the software can sometimes cause the computer to freeze when opening the main console for changing the profiles for buttons and lighting effects. While these are just some of the bugs I have come across while using this mouse I still enjoy it and know that with time software can be updated to fix these bugs. All in all a great mouse for everyday use and some gaming but beware the software bugs.
B002KS1IJC|5.0|Very good storyline wish more movies were this good but they are far and few.  So do not pass this one up.
0440219078|3.0|I'm not even sure how to rate this book honestly. I loved it....until it ended and I was left feeling like there had to have been something I missed...or pages I didn't receive during my Kindle download. If you've read the book and you're thinking I'm just someone that doesn't like to interpret things or think behind the obvious meaning then you're wrong. I love anything that gets me thinking! I just felt like I was left hanging with this book.<br /><br />The book was written beautifully and it definitely surprises you from time to time. It's a great concept, no doubt. I just felt confused and frustrated with the ending. I was convinced, when I found out that there were more books to the series, that the next book would still be about Jonas, but it's not. I'd love to read the rest of the books in the quartet but I'm worried they will all end the same way. The ending was especially surprising given it's a young adult fiction book. I felt like it didn't bring home the necessary conclusion that a book should bring for a young adult fiction. Ultimately it reminded me of the Seinfeld series...great show that ended in an unexpected and, in my opinion, disappointing fashion.

1936608898|5.0|Dallas and Melissa Hartwig of Whole9 have truly outdone themselves with this book. If you are looking for a book that covers all the basics of a healthy diet, do yourself a favor and read it. It Starts With Food also makes a perfect gift for someone in your life who wants to get their health back on track.<br /><br />It Starts With Food details the science and reasoning behind the Whole30 program, and Melissa and Dallas have mastered the science. Filled with great analogies to make these complicated processes relatable, you'll walk away knowing exactly how your body works and what foods will and will not make you healthier. As the Hartwigs say, \\"The food you eat either makes you more healthy or less healthy. Those are your options.\\" Choosing your food wisely is critical, and the Hartwigs show you exactly how to do it.<br /><br />Dallas and Melissa have developed a set of standards for which all food on the Whole30 must fit into. They call these the Good Food Standards, which state:<br /><br />The foods we eat should:<br />1. Promote a healthy psychological response.<br />2. Promote a healthy hormonal response.<br />3. Support a healthy gut.<br />4. Support immune function and minimize inflammation.<br />5. The Hartwigs nailed it on this one - good food should indeed do all these things, and by eating good food we can achieve good health. Dallas and Melissa go over each of these standards in detail and teach you exactly what foods do - and do not - fit in.<br /><br />It Starts With Food also covers meal planning (and makes it incredibly easy), teaches you how to reintroduce foods, and a includes a whole chapter devoted to achieving long-term success with their program (which offers a few much-needed pages on getting support from your friends and family, or dealing with those who don't support you). They also provide a chapter about making the program work for you if you have a condition which warrants further dietary concerns, like IBS/IBD, autoimmune conditions, and food allergies. Lastly, you'll find the Meal Map - a fantastic resource for making easy and delicious meals throughout your Whole30 program.<br /><br />It Starts With Food is a wonderful resource for anyone looking to fine-tune their health.

B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I've been waiting for this film since I read about it, a couple of years ago. Ridley Scott, Damon Lindelof, Noomi Rapace, link to the \\"Alien\\" franchise? I'm there, when does it open?<br /><br />Saw it in IMAX 3D, and that's the way it was meant to be seen. A great use of that median, especially Fassbender's scene with the interstellar map. You feel like you are in the room. It is a spectacular gorgeous film, the fly by over Iceland in the beginning is remarkable, and the action/horror scenes have an added impact, due to the sight and sound technology. Kudos to Scott for using all of it.<br /><br />Lindelof's script revisits a \\"Lost\\" theme - Science versus/and faith. Rapace's Shaw is at the center, a scientist who believes in a God, and wants to find the Creator. \\"Where did we come from\\" is her big question. Rapace is surrounded with a great cast, including Fassbender (who delivers his part excellently), Theron, Elba, Pearce and even Kate Dickie (crazy Lysa Arryns from Game of Thrones.)<br /><br />It's Ridley's ride, and he takes you from feeling whistful and optimistic to being horrified and scared in the space of 2 hours. It does have all of the elements of the original \\"Alien\\". Space jockey, face hugger, chest burster, robot, evil corporation, it's all there. Noomi Rapace as Lizbeth Shaw fulfills every expectation I had of her. She is the motor to the movie, the one to watch.<br /><br />I've read where some folks don't like the film because it doesn't answer any questions. I wouldn't see this movie in that light, since when do we ever get the answers we want with anything Lindelof writes? It is a great sci-fi film, and you should see it if you are a fan of the genre, and especially if you love the \\"Alien\\" franchise. See it on the big screen, then buy the Blu Ray. Sit back, enjoy.<br /><br />I was 18 years old when I saw the first \\"Alien\\" movie in the theater. I remember how it made me feel to this day - scared, horrified, anxious, suspenseful, and finally thrilledwhen the hero turned out to be a woman. It was the first VHS tape I bought, it was the first DVDs (box set) I bought, I even named my dog Ripley. I love this franchise, and \\"Prometheus\\" is a fine addition.<br /><br />EDIT: I was so fascinated by this movie in IMAX 3D I went and saw it again, knowing that I would probably never have that chance again. I spent the week in between reading reviews and interviews about the film.  I enjoyed it as much the second time, and believe that this is one helluva sci-fi film. I'd say it's Scott's best film in years. \\"Prometheus\\" manages to find a balance as a beautiful, thoughtful clever film, with some very visceral horror thrown in. The action snaps along at brisk pace, the music score is great,and there are some interesting techniques used to move the story along that I've never seen before.<br /><br />I eagerly wait for this Blu ray dvd to be released, I'd love to see the directors cut.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|My only regret is that I did not go to the movie theatre. I finished watching it and I would watch it again (if it wasn't almost 4 am). These real life heroes give me goosebumps. Movie is action-packed, but also emotional. So what if the Navy SEALS can't act?! That's the best part. It felt like you are let in a secret, in their lifes... Wow!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|Game is super fun. Objectives can be really hard to complete but are totally worth it. I love this game!
B005LAIGZU|5.0|Now before I start I will let everyone know that I have not yet purchased movie but I do intend to because I love good action adventure movies. Now I only saw the first ten minutes and I want to see the rest and I will be adding this to my collection when I can! I love first person shooter video games so the fact that this movie has that (not sure how much) makes me want to see it even more.

0316069353|2.0|If you've ever sat through a real criminal trial - and as an ex-reporter, I sat though many dozens - you know they are actually quite boring, for the most part, with certain exceptions during really compelling testimony. But this legal thriller subjects you almost to an actual trial transcript, with every line, question, gesture and motivation spelled out in agonizing detail. If that's your cup of tea, fine. I was bored. I yearned for those moments in the story when we finally step outside the courtroom for some action. But they are not enough. Connelly spent a lot of time in courts as an LA Times and Fort Lauderdale newspaper reporter. He heard all this dialogue countless times, no doubt. It's just not that interesting, if you've ever really been there.

B005LAIGZU|5.0|We watch movies based on the way they make us feel.  We are seeking some kind of feeling when we put it in the disc player.  Sometimes we know what to expect and we take a gamble- that is a part of the fun even if the movie is disappointing.  Professional Movie Critics often don't get this.  An action or war movie is just an action or war movie.  I go in with that minimal expectation and I am never disappointed.  Movie directors, producers  and \\"professional movie critics\\" dismiss most of the movies normal people living in the other 99 percent of the world enjoy.  This is the beauty of the online, normal John Doe Review living outside the Hollywood elitist scene in the 99 percent real world.<br /><br />Having said this, I was expecting an excellent movie because the trailers alone had already set my normal action war movie expectation. I was ready to feel good about this one.  The movie went beyond my expectations and blew me away.  Now, I am not your normal war/military movie buff.  I own a collection, thanks mostly to Amazon, of some 50 to 60 war movies- one for every week of the year and every war America has fought.  I am so intense on historical accuracy that I insist on switching back and forth through my D-day viewing cycle from Band of Brothers [[ASIN:B00129H7VS Band of Brothers [Blu-ray]]] to Saving Private Ryan  [[ASIN:B003LL3N1I Saving Private Ryan (Sapphire Series)  [Blu-ray]]] playing and pausing both on two separate DVD players.  The paratroopers are working to take out the brutal German 88's behind the lines aimed at the beaches while our boys are landing.  I start the yearly cycle with The Patriot [[ASIN:B000PAAJVA The Patriot (Extended Cut) [Blu-ray]]] and now end with Act of Valor.  I remember these guys even if the world forgets.<br /><br />So, it is fair to say I have seen my share of war movies and in particular American soldier tribute movies.  These are movies that the real 99 percent actually love.  The true 1 percent in America are the Hollywood elites, Government ruling and Union classes.  Wallstreet actually represents most of the 99 percent's retirement portfolios.  This is extremely relevant to this review based on the simple fact that in my search for the top 50 best soldier sacrifice tribute pieces the vast majority of war movies in general are America hating garbage.  Most put out by the 1 percent Hollywood elite Marxist leaning producers, writers and directors show our troops in the greatest negative light possible: unintelligent, limited vocabulary morons who kill and rape for the fun of it.  While that may be true for a handful, those of us in the real 99 percent world with family members and loved ones in harms way pay tribute to the real American soldier.  Even the out of touch elitist's freedom to be so idiotically wrong and twisted about life in general is protected by these great warriors.<br /><br />The very best of America's men and women are accurately portrayed in this movie Act of Valor and it is the exact opposite of the tripe usually produced by Hollywood.  They have spouses and families they nurture.  They take lives to protect lives in America and around the world.  We see their goodness and the evil of the terrorists in stark realistic contrast.  We see their professionalism and superb physical and mental training outwitting and punishing evil.  They are a warrior class living among us willing to give their lives for their fellow Seals and us at a moments notice without flinching or blinking.  These are rare and wonderful traits and even more rare is the opportunity for us to finally see it in action.  Along with their many portrayed virtues, we see modesty.  They do not talk, they just head down range and do their job.  We can see why they might be a little offended (just a little) when a 1 percent representing political leader possessing no understanding of this Seal Creed actually has the unmitigated gall to take full credit for their actions.  This movie really helps us relate to that perspective.<br /><br />I am a business man working for a regional financial instituition helping small businesses survive every single day in this economy.  I have seen my own share of economic casualties.  This movie is life changing.  I get up everyday and sometimes have to will myself to work in the midst of the economic devastation.  The US military inspires me to do my part.  If they can give their very lives to keep us free from fear and death, I can at the very least do what I do best and help keep the engines of our free economy moving.  In this very small way I try to honor their sacrifice.  Definitely one of the most inspiring and realistic movies of the year for the true American 99 percent.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I've been a Rush fan since 1980 when I was 12, and I was disappointed in some of their stuff from the late 80's through the 90's.  This is not to say that those albums were bad, just that that period isn't my favorite and I don't listen to those albums very frequently.  I point this out so that this 5-star review won't be dismissed as a \\"fanboy\\" review.  And as always with a review of this type, it is very subjective as there is no accounting for taste.<br /><br />The technical ability, songwriting, lyrics and production quality of this album are spectacular.  I don't know any other way to put it.  I got ahold of the mp3s about a week ago (I've subsequently purchase the CD, more on that in a bit) and I've listened start to finish over 20 times.  The music is energizing in much the same way that Signals was in 1982 and I do not tire of the album.  I cannot say the same for some of the 90's albums like Presto.<br /><br />One of the things I like most about this band, besides their music, is their work ethic and the fact that in real life they are genuinely nice people.  Most rock musicians with this kind of success at this age seem to want to milk the past for all they can, for minimal effort.  Rush on the other hand just completed a marathon, monster tour, then headed back into the studio and cranked out an album that clearly required a great deal of time and effort to create, that is original, but still clearly Rush.<br /><br />I initially had some 192kbps mp3s, but I purchased the CD and it arrived yesterday (6/11).  I have to say that comparing the CD to 192k mp3s, there really is no comparison.  I've ben listening to FLAC rips from the CD and it is a far better experience.  there is a crispness in the music that the mp3 compression obscures.  GEt the CD or get the 24-bit FLAC files from HD Tracks
0446310786|2.0|I will not be writing about the story, just the actual book.<br />I am not happy with the quality of this book. I bought a book listed Acceptable with details as gentle wear and tear.

B005LAIHXQ|4.0|Prometheus was a decent film.  It delivered in the areas of epic sci-fi and horror.  However, it did have some flaws.  Most of the characters were unlikable and, as with most Ridley Scott films, the tone was very cold.  I was a bit unclear on the motivations of the Michael Fassbender character (I won't spoil anything), also, and I felt that the spiritual vs. scientific themes of human origin and creation came across as somewhat heavy-handed.  The film works best, I think, when it is in fright mode.  The gore effects, and the contexts in which they appear, are worthy of the man who directed the first Alien movie, and are sure to please genre fans.  All in all, the film was affecting and pretty intelligent.  The script was also all over the place, which is fine as far as I'm concerned.  It made for some unpredictability in a movie market that is absolutely FULL of predictability.  Final verdict:  Not as good as Alien, but still definitely worthy the fans' time.

B000JQU1VS|5.0|Remarkably good detective fiction. Although over a century old, it still reads fresh. I expected anachronistic language and dated plots - what I got was crisp and current. In fact, I was really surprised by how modern and current the word usage and vocabulary were. Don't know what I was expecting; maybe thees and thous (?), and instead got modern language, and modern detective fiction in the Victorian world.<br /><br />All the modern treatments of Sherlock and Watson leave off the depth of feeling between the two men: respect, teamwork, and a whatever-comes-next bonhomie. These guys were poised at all times to handle whatever life (and their cases) threw at them.<br /><br />Reading these in order gave me a new respect for Arthur Conan Doyle, and his creation. Geniuses.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|UPDATE<br />It's been well over a year since I wrote this review, and did so against my usual nature (after one listen). But I was in the moment and ran with it.<br /><br />Clockwork Angels is, in fact, one of the finest works by Rush. And I can say the live experience did more than due justice to all these songs, as some simply sounded better live. That shouldn't happen, but this is, after all, Rush.<br /><br />To my specific gripes from before:<br />* Innovation: The band did innovate. It's a pretty clear contrast from Snakes and Arrows for sure, but it is tighter and clean, and in time the familiarity has set in so well that I frequently listen to the whole record. I can't say that of Snakes and Arrows or Test for Echo 18 months after their respective releases.<br />* Expectations: I had hoped this would be more inspired by their 1970s work -- not a derivative rehash mind you, but real inspiration as found in Headlong Flight and even BU2B.<br /><br />This truly is a cohesive, thoughtful effort. I think having seen it live with almost all the songs performed helped in some subconscious way. The music is rewarding, the story is engaging, and the wholeness of the record is most gratifying.<br /><br />____________________________________________<br />ORIGINAL 3-STAR REVIEW (after 1 listen)<br />I've only given it one listen (and you know I need at least three). So this is not an official review from me yet, hence the three stars.<br /><br />The problem with music is that the genuine artists (like Rush) are doing what they really want to do and that doesn't always align with what we expect. I know you know that. If we can't all get along, then we'll listen a while and move on -- or move back to the comfort zone of Moving Pictures, 2112, Permanent Waves, and (of course) the death-metal remix of Tai Shan (or, you know, not). Stepping back from the production, I appreciate that they have attacked a theme, gotten behind it and pulled it off fairly well. They have venturedwell outside of their musical comfort zone here (in contrast to say Test For Echo where they really didn't push forward; it's a very good record, but more of a melting pot of ideas and virtuosity drawn from the preceding decade or so). Snakes and Arrows pushed some boundaries, but it was overproduced and felt a bit restrained - say, in contrast to Vapor Trails which, despite the tragic audio issues, was raw, threw discretion to the wind, and took a lot of chances and prevailed (Ghost Rider, Peaceable Kingdom, Vapor Trail, Earth Shine, Nocturn, Freeze -- great songs and all atypical Rush: no solos, really, understated bass, layered vocal textures in lieu of synths, and very personal lyrics throughout). The songwriting on that record exceeds anything they've created since Grace Under Pressure (or maybe as recently as Counterparts, or maybe even further back to Moving Pictures). But that's my opinion (and I have a review of the record elsewhere on Amazon).<br /><br />The other problem for Clockwork Angels was that of too lofty expectations, that this record would be more of a throwback to the Rush of the 70s -- not to double-dip into their legacy per se but to simplify the sound and extend some of the songs a bit more (and granted, most exceed the traditional 5 to 6 minute mark). We get some of that, but we also get a lot of sonic nuances and twists that is fresh versus familiar. Headlong Flight is probably what most of us expected, but we were pleasantly caught off guard by Clockwork Angels (title track) and The Garden, among others.<br /><br />The solution is to just look at it for what it is: A very mature, dynamic record that weaves a story with tracks that can stand on their own, produced by musicians who have been touring and tiring and trying and triumphing like, well, clockwork, for decades.<br /><br />In record reviews, some speak to the Rush Fan and some speak to the record buying public. I'm just speaking so far to what it is: The 20th studio record by Rush. TWENNNN-TYYYY-ETH. My formal review is pending. But my first impression is that it is indeed impressive and worthy of many more listens and reflection.<br /><br />To think Clockwork Angels could become someone's first experience ever hearing Rush is comforting, simply because there is so much there already that inspires.<br /><br />Even after one listen.
B0086700CM|5.0|Don't buy this app...if you don't want to be glued to your screen for hours! This game is fairly simple, all you have to do is run. Then there are obstacles than you have to go over, under, and around. You can collect coins also, and use them to buy powerups, avatars, etc. The description says that there is in-app purchasing. You do NOT have to purchase anything unless you want to buy an excessive number of items in the store. I am quite addicted to this game, and I strongly recommend it.
B00004IC9G|3.0|Manowar is an amazing band, not because they're good musicians, nor great songwriters, because their true talent lies in being one of the most enduringly (and endearingly) ridiculous bands in the history of metal.  They are so self-important and bombastic that it is really kind of charming.  To see them live is the only way to get the true experience of both Manowar and their fans, the \\"Manowarriors.\\" However, \\"Battle Hymns\\" is a great introduction to the absurdity that is Manowar.  My favorite song is the eponymous fifth track which tells the story of \\"Manowar: born to live forevermore, the right to conquer every shore!\\" complete with silly octave jumps and cheesy tempo changes.<br /><br />The fact that there's not a touch of intended humor in a single note that they play or syllable they utter is what makes them pure hilarity.  If someone were to try to create something this funny, it would sound forced and contrived.  It is Manowar's pure earnest desire to create \\"true metal\\" without any trace of irony that makes so side-splittingly funny.  \\"Death to false metal!\\"
B005LAIHXQ|2.0|A disapointment.  Not without some merit, but not close to the Ridley Scott's greatest works.  No Blade Runner, or even Alien, here.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|Here's what's intended to be a quick review of \\"Prometheus\\"...on the fly. Warning ahead of time for those who have not yet seen the movie: my review will contain SPOILERS. I saw the film today at Rave Motion Pictures 18, 3-D, Xtreme Theater 18 in Columbus, Ohio, and I think it's a spectacle of a film to behold. It is truly awesome in scope and its implications. Now, I don't wish to argue about whether it's a prequel or a companion piece. The truth of the matter can be found in the DVD edition of \\"Alien\\" during the director's commentary in which Ridley Scott himself talks about his desire over the years to revist the origins of the alien creatures and their link to humanity and uncovering the mystery of the space-ship. If anyone doubts this, listen to his commentary on \\"Alien\\". But back to \\"Promethus\\". This film, I believe, is his chance to do just that. And I think he did it masterfully.<br /><br />However and unfortunately, the film is not without its flaws. I believe these flaws are mostly rooted in the writing and not the directing. The flaws are are in the lack of attempt--perhaps even imagination--to take the familiar conventions of the \\"Alien movies\\" and up-end them. I'm just going to bullet-point some ideas.<br /><br />1. Obviously, \\"Alien\\" is a masterpiece. But generally speaking this type of film that \\"Alien\\" pioneered--along with most horror films--requires that the characters do stupid things in order to put themselves in harm's way; things such as violating protocol and snooping around when it's readily apparent snooping around isn't such a good idea. Unfortunately, this happens too much in this film. But I digress. Let me revist \\"Alien.\\"<br /><br />2. About \\"Alien.\\" The thrust of the drama is the various characters violating protocol regarding contamination and setting bad things in motion. Ripley was the character who most adhered to  protocol. However, I cannot remember what \\"Mother\\"--the ship's computer--said if anything about protocol. This leads meto point #3.<br /><br />3. I believe the characters in \\"Prometheus\\" violated protocol too early, too easily, too snuggly; and it was something we've all seen before. How to get around this?<br /><br />4. I think perhaps the writers might have turned this convention on its head. What if these characters were all disciplined from the start in adhering to protocol at all times? Period. Meaning that there was no conflict between them. But, you might say, there would be no conflict if that were the case. Perhaps you are right. Yet, it might just have worked nevertheless. Here's how. What if \\"Mother\\" gives the all-clear from the get-go upon their awakening from stasis? That would have been an interesting reversal of the story convention. It gives the characters an understandable false sense of security. And since the pitch of this film is that we are going to find the origins of humanity, it creates a different scenario at the start. Yet, it offers some conflict in itself.<br /><br />5. It could be that Mother genuinely thinks the planet is safe. But Mother, as it turns out, is not as sophisticated as the alien inhabitants of this planet. This would have given the characters sufficient cover to abandon protocol in understandable ways. This also opens up other story possibilities. Is Mother being duplicitous? Is she a traitor to the cause? So, there's room for plot movement and story ambiguity. The major dramatic story questions, among other things, at the start of the movie would have been this: is the planet truly safe? Are the aliens good? Or has Mother made an innocent mistake because the aliens are too sophisticated as we come to see. Or is Mother so sophisticated herself--even beyond the sophisticatation of the aliens that she has to play many cards--both an innocent card and a guilty card--in order to affect the safest outcome for humanity, and thus the ending of the film as it happened. That is, Mother was ahead of the game from the outset, or perhaps she had to catch-up a bit. In this version, Mother trumps all in terms of knowledge.<br /><br />6. The advantage of this is that it would have elminated the scenes of otherwise smart characters doing stupid things like waving his hand and smiling at an alien tentacle which has risen from murky, alien depths. Well...I could go on about such scenes. And I'm not saying my solution solves all of these problems. But it would have been, perhaps, more disarming for the viewer to see the characters having good cause to have their guards down. It would have also been a bit fresher to see a crew who can act more professionally and not always be at odds with each other. That would have made the events even more frightening. It would have also created more comraderie among the crew intead of, well, alienation. All-for-one-one-for-all. That is to say, thematically, if humanity is to survive, it must learn to cooperate with itself...or else it is vulnerable. Ask yoursef, is humanity now more or less cooperative with itself? Will it ever learn? If so, how? Are the evil aliens in full cooperation with themselves? Yes. Thus, they have the advantage.<br /><br />7. Nevertheless, this is an awesome movie. I think it's a modern classic. And I loved the double-twist ending.<br /><br />8. \\"Prometheus\\" will stand unbound as a modern classic.<br /><br />9. Last point, I also appreciated the fact that the film clocked-in over two hours. Not everybody has the attention span of a hyper-active adolescent.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|I think people have this propensity to pick apart and complain about every minute and somewhat insignificant plot detail that doesn't spell out exactly what they are seeing, while simultaneously failing to see the overall picture and vision. This movie answered some big questions in my mind that began with Alien, if not in exact detail, they were eluded to enough to hopefully get the bigger picture if and when a sequel is filmed. I think in part that was the point, to begin to uncover some of the answers, but allow more questions to be answered in the future. Maybe some won't, who knows. Either way, I had the opposite reaction of people who didn't like it, where I was totally pulled into the fllm and from start to end tried to make connections to start to piece together the entire story. From Prometheus you realize the Alien story is more epic than you would have imagined, and I hope it will continue because it has taken the story in a new direction similar to what the new Star Trek did for that series. Alient 3 and 4 were watchable, but kind of ridiculous and disappointing at the same time. I'd rather watch A v P. People who don't like this movie might have also thought Avatar or Independence Day were great sci-fi films. Wait.. I'm getting a flashback; Will Smith punching out a huge alien and not breaking his frail hand on it's massive helmet, Bill Pullman's here comes America to save the world again speech, and Avatar's high school-like, over-emotional chosen one alien love story. Hut hut... hike! Ugh. Maybe I would have liked Avatar better if I hadn't seen it in 3d. Those glasses are terrible, and then when I took them off because I couldn't stand keeping them on my face, I realized they should probably come with a free packet of dramamine. Anyway. I'd say if you like darker, more 'realistic' sci-fi movies like Pandorum, Moon, The Thing ('82), or the original Alien/Aliens then you'll love this. I saw a comment about there being a bunch of insignificant people onthe team which created weak characters - I think this was true of Aliens, where the marine team was larger until the core 'team' went into the installation and you care that they made it or not. In another comment someone said they didn't care at all about the main characters, but in Alien there wasn't a lot of backstory given about each person either. Prometheus was a different story with different characters, some of which you weren't supposed to like. I personally thought it was a great movie that if given a chance, will ignite the imagination, and at the same time loosely tie together the Alien/Aliens movies. Its 'message', if there is one, is much deeper and more haunting than the average sci-fi charater-undeveloped effect-fest that works well for the person that searches for the true answers to understanding the universe, whatever they may be. If you are bored easily, love the new Transformers movies because they move real fast without time to agitate the ol' ADD even though the dialog completely sucks, then you'll be disappointed. If you like sci-fi and are a fan of Alien/Aliens then watch this movie, it has a brain and the effects are amazing. A director's cut that develops the plot even further would be awesome.

0312641893|5.0|I read a lot of fairytale adaptations (it's one of my favourite things to read in YA, obviously from the amount of them I review), but out of all I've read so far, Cinders is hands down the most original and unique, standing out from the rest by a mile. It is a scifi rendition of the tale, not a Dystopian Scifi, but pure, beautiful Scifi. It is the future and when someone faces a very gruesome injury they can have their lives saved by fixing themselves up with robotic parts, and Cinder is one such person who has \\"benefited\\" from one of these surgeries from when she was young.<br /><br />Of course, \\"normal humans\\" are fairly prejudiced against people with robotic parts, and since Cinder has a lot of robotic parts (including a leg and arm) she is a bit of a social pariah, and is especially so with her Step-Mother and older Step-Sister.<br /><br />The world building in this novel is awe inspiring, I had not trouble understanding the world and getting sucked into it, and though many of the main milestones of the fairytale are reached, the tale was so well done that I actually forgot that it was based off Cinderella from time to time, because it was such a great story aside from that.<br /><br />The characters are very well done as well. I loved how the younger of the two step-sisters was actually quite fond of Cinder, thus giving Cinder quite the drive later in the book. I feel like there is also a depth to many of the characters which is easy to forget about in scifi or fantasy novels as the world building takes up so much thought.<br /><br />There seems to be four more books in the series (according to the page in the front) and I have no doubt that this world can handle more books to explore it more. I also wonder if the author will borrow from other fairytales for it, but if she doesn't, I'd still be excited to read them.<br /><br />--<br /><br />If you like Science Fiction and you like Fairytales you need to pick up and read this book right this second. In my opinion, Cinder is a beautiful marriage of the two. If you also want a very unique adaptation of Cinderella to read this is it. The time I waited to read this book was well worth it.on, Cinder is a beautiful marriage of the two. If you also want a very unique adaptation of Cinderella to read this is it.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|This album is a magnificent summation of the Rush career so far. You can hear splinters and snippets of the past, but not in a cameo throwback kind of way, but rather as well used tools in the Rush toolbox. And, as this is Rush, there is huge amount of simply new territory here. It hits hard at some places, and at some points it feels like you're listening to a metal record. Then, it'll switch gears, and you travel across jazz, blues, classical orchestras, and even a bit of pop. The title track is worthy of it's place on the album, it being a mini-concept in itself.<br /><br />There are a few less than marvelous points, but these points are still solid and would have been considered strong tracks on albums like Snakes and Arrows.<br /><br />Overall, if you're a Rush fan you need this. It might be a little much to wade into from people who haven't listened to Rush, however.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I can't believe how much negative feedback this book has received. I loved everything about it. Yes, it starts out slow, but past chapter 5, it gets so good. I am not one to read these types of books. I love Jodi Picoult, but all the hype about it, made me pick it up and I am so glad I did. I am already on the 2nd book and I just go it the other day. It's definitely an A+ in my eyes!

The movie makes every scene grand in scope and style, and I absolutely love the actors and actresses, each one fits their role perfectly!  Highly recommend if you haven't see it.

B0007KS7D0|5.0|I ordered this for my advanced Canon digicams, the G12 and SX 40. Both have capacity for adding filters. The superzoom Canon SX 40 works particularly well with the Raynox DCR 150. The filter adapter is not required with this attachment on the SX 40.  I did, by the way, try it on an old 35mm zoom lens, and it worked well with that lens too. Yes there will be vignetting at wide-angle focal lengths, but the telephoto focal lenths really bring out the most of this accessory. With telephoto settings (allowing really impressive magnification), vignetting is NOT an issue. Based on reviews, I'm glad I started with the more user-friendly Raynox 150 vs. the 250. Even the 150 can be touchy with focus and shallow depth of field, and I often take photos without a tripod. I'm planning to get a compact/short tripod and/or a light & short monopod to improve stability without the hassle of a large tripod. This device adds a great deal of fun for macro photography without spending a lot of money.
B002BWP49C|5.0|I like so much this story, is fantastic the performance of Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson, very well th acting
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This book was an amazing story that I could not stop reading. I have now read the book through six times and still love it just as much as I did the first time! Everything about this book had me hooked, from Abby's dark secret to Travis' bad- boy player reputation.<br /><br />The book starts out memorable and exciting with the main character, eighteen year old college student Abby, getting splattered with blood at an underground fight club. (I hate books with slow starts, so this was a plus for me.) This is the first time Abby meets Travis. He is a tattooed, fighting, player, the exact opposite of what she is looking for in a guy. He goes to the same college as her, but Abby is determined to stay far away from him. It turns out it is easier said then done considering Abby's best friend is dating Travis' roommate. Even with Travis flirting with her she manages to ignore him pretty well, that is, until the bet.<br /><br />After loosing a bet with Travis, Abby is forced to get closer to him and is surprised by how nice he can be. Eventually he even stops hitting on her. In no time at all Abby and Travis are great friends and everything is going great, but then another boy enters the picture and chaos breaks loose.<br /><br />This book was so good I had to write a review. Anyone who is a fan of a good drama filled romance needs to read this amazing book!!!

B000ZOXDFA|1.0|The first film had many inaccuracies yet managed to hold itself together in quite an arresting way. The Golden Age is equally full of historical holes yet fails abominably. (The absence of Dudley and Essex, two key players at Elizabeth's court, did not go unnoticed.) The reason for this is, I think, less to do with factual errors in major historical events--such as details of the Armada--and more to do with inaccurate characterization. Clive Owen is decidedly charmless as Walter Raleigh, who should have been vain, captivating, and merciless. Cate Blanchett projects neither the majesty nor the flirtatiousness of Elizabeth, preferring to foghorn her lines like a novice transvestite. Laurence Fox's Christopher Hatton doesn't dance once. I know very little about Philip II, but that is ultimately unnecessary since he utters the same camp threats in every scene. The music is over-the-top and irritating. The writing is so preposterous that it's almost an afterthought. The camerawork largely consists of slow-motion close-ups or revolving shots reminiscent of fashion adverts. These techniques are used throughout the entirety of Mary Queen of Scots last segment, making it painfully melodramatic. The director also relies several times on the \\"God's-eye-view\\" shots he employed in the first film. I wished several times that God's eye would unhinge and squash Blanchett, thereby ending her strutting second-rate drag-queenery once and for all. And was I the only one that shivered when the film went chillingly jingoistic near the end?<br /><br />In other words, how could they let this happen?

B005K17RU0|5.0|This is the BEST weather app Ive found. I love it so much I have it on my phone as well.
030771652X|4.0|It starts off a little slow, so I almost put it down. And I wasn't sure I liked the narrator, so I almost put it down. But, not having a good book to read, I continued. I am so glad I did! After the first 50ish pages, the story carries you on with unexpected twists and several annoying but interesting characters. Maybe I'm slow but I didn't figure out \\"whodunit\\" until the narrator did. Planning to check out Lupton's next one.

B0085Z8F4A|5.0|No spoilers here:<br /><br />Ridley did it again but I think many people will not like this movie because it doesn't have non-stop killer alien action. Thank god for that! This movie is a grand story about OUR birth and evolution and who or what started it. I also think this movie may be to smart for most people. Another classic has arrived and they'll never know it. A crying shame.<br /><br />  Here we go: Still no spoilers<br />A small group of scientist pick-up on an ancient trail of extra terrestrial origin and get the chance of a lifetime to chase it down. They make it to a far off world where they get very close to meeting humanity's creators only to find they are all long dead under mysterious circumstances. As the crew continues to explore the alien \\"facility\\" they make a terrifying discovery but they have no idea just how utterly horrifying it really is! Some never find out. The ending is rather tragic, as with all the Alien movies, but in a bit of a different way this time around.<br /><br />This movie is for the mature viewer and we all know there are a painful few of us out there LOL! Im ever so glad Ridley refused to dumb it down. I saw this in 3D and loved every minute of it so im going back for seconds as soon as I can. I know masterful story telling when I see it and I want more!

159448385X|5.0|I read The Kite Runner a few years back. While reading \\"A Thousand Spendid Suns\\"  midway through I felt a little manipulated and very disturbed by the brutal life the author was reminding me existed in Afghanistan again. But at the end of this excellent book I felt nothing but gratitude for him, for writing such a realistic drama. Full of imagery, beauty, style and grace of a country, a culture and a faith. I was surprised at how emotional I got while reading this, it was hard to take at times for this reader. I feel this book changed me as a human being, for the better. Khaled is an amazing author!<br /><br />I like to brag to people how great books can make me cry unexpectedly. This is a great great book!<br /><br />Excellent audio book reading by Atossa Leoni!
B002T9H2ME|4.0|I have watched MOON a second time and  it is still the  great movie that it was when I first saw it.It's amazing what you can do on a small budget.Some people will be annoyed at the many references to other scifi films but that is only a small point.Yes,the acting is superb but you also need a great director to make the film a winner.It is superbly directed so it is a must see film. Warning-don't watch the trailer or  extras before seeing the film as  too much of the secret is given away.I hate it when they tell you too much in the trailer.Also avoid the  Director's interview in the extras. You cringe listening to him say 'um' every few seconds.Can't he give a talk without  continuously saying 'um' before  every sentence.He must hold  the world record for the  number of times he uses this word  in an interview.I hope he reads this review and learns from it.
B0076XIS4O|4.0|One of the best albums of 2012.  An album that I honestly did not expect to like but can't stop listening to.  A lot of funky beats, vocals over chants, and futuristic sounds.  Highlights are \\"Genesis,\\" \\"Oblivion,\\" and \\"Nightmusic.\\"  There are some songs that are under the two minute mark that add to the flow of the album but why I would give this a 4 out of 5.  Grimes follows through on her third record to provide an experimental ride into the weird- and it works.  Give this album a chance.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|Regardless of the age bracket into which you may fall, this is an entertaining and thought provoking movie.  Like any good book to movie adaptation, it is captivating and enjoyable for those who have read the book as well as those who have not.  It is an interesting examination of a dystopian post-apocolyptic society, and provides a glimpse into the depths to which our society could sink if political agendas and egos were allowed to go unchecked.  I'm sure over time, it will become a film that is used in the classroom to accompany reading the text in studying government and social studies topics.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is great I luv  it and I have a great time playing it!!! I hope you get great reviews!

1423136802|5.0|Let me start this review with a little information about myself.  I am a 30 year old male and was never a big reader.  For some reason, not really sure what, I decided I wanted to get into reading.  I searched a lot of young adult fantasy books and finally decided on the Percy Jackson series.  I always enjoyed Greek mythology in high school and thought that Percy Jackson was similar enough to most of the other popular series but had the mythology aspect of it which made it unique.<br /><br />I got through all five books in about one month, reading for a few hours a night a couple times a week.  I honestly could not put any of these books down!  There are really no slow stretches, just when you think things are slowing down, BOOM something crazy happens and before you know it minutes turn to hours.  There is a good amount of humor in this series as well, not sure everyone who reads it will understand it, since it is geared towards a much younger crowd than myself.<br /><br />The Percy Jackson series is one that I will never forget.  An excellent blend of character development, friendships, action, adventure, suspense, humor...you name it, it is there!  I am not sure which book was my favorite, I would probably lean towards \\"The Titan's Curse\\" but all five books were excellent and I was sad to finish the series!<br /><br />This series is absolutely a lot of fun for all ages and all types of readers.  I highly recommend picking up the box set because you will have a hard time putting these books down!
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|draw something is a great game. but one major problem is it takes forever to log into facebook proparly. basic logon screen but then it will ask to send emails and says facebook logon error. after several tries it works and stays logged in for a long time. thats the only thing that keeps me from giving it a five.
B007G5GYHA|4.0|I was baby sitting my nephew which is 3, and he wanted to watch this movie.  I rented it through Amazon and it streamed very well.  I only wish the rental time was longer than 24 hours.  The movie was hilarious and action packed with a little bit of romance.  It might have been a little but of an older age group movie choice for him, but it is a great family film.
1936608898|5.0|I have spent the last 10+ years searching for a food and healthy-eating guide that I could understand, enjoy and actually incorporate into my everyday life... and I have finally found it in Melissa & Dallas Hartwig's, \\"It Starts with Food.\\" Their writing is simple, clear, funny(!), and full of those forehead-smacking moments of truth where you think to yourself \\"how the heck did I not know this/notice this/recognize this sooner?!\\" Luckily, these 2 authors have found a way to tell a story about what we eat, how we eat it, WHY we eat it, and how we can modify our eating choices for better health in an incredibly approachable way, while still weaving in real, well-articulated research (they call it the \\"science-y stuff\\") that made me confident that I was getting information that was as reputable as it was interesting and entertaining.<br /><br />When I finished reading \\"It Starts with Food,\\" I felt like I had direction and information that I could immediately apply to my life, and that I also had a road map to help me walk down a new path of eating for the long term that will take me in an entirely new and entirely more healthy direction. With \\"It Starts with Food\\" as my guidebook, source of reference, and Bible for Good Food choices, I also feel well-armed and equally well-informed to spread the word to friends, family and co-workers about their message! But finally - and probably most important (to me) - is that I feel like I have cheerleaders and champions in my new \\"friends\\" Melissa and Dallas. While reading their book I felt that they were truly, genuinely, hugely rooting for me to succeed in this journey toward better health.<br /><br />I can't recommend this book enough - if you buy one for yourself I can pretty much guarantee that you'll be back on Amazon purchasing additional copies for those people in your life who you want to join the Good Food movement with you!
0345803485|1.0|I really don't understand why this book is a best seller.  There is no character development, the dialogue is tedious, no plot. I could go on but the most helpful reviews on here say it all and are much more entertaining than the book.  Save your money, this book is a waste!
B007Z9RAX4|4.0|I had to share my opinion of this movie as it is under rated by others.  This is a movie you should watch.  It has an interesting plot although is at times difficult to follow easily.  I chose it for the plot while expecting I would see mediocre \\"non realistic\\" fight scenes presented by regular actors like most films present to us.  I was pleasantly surprised!  What I found was not a high budget film but it had a solid plot, solid acting, an interesting story line with very realistic fight scenes.  As a woman in the martial arts, I could actually believe those techniques would work as presented to us by Gina.  Little did I know when I watched the movie that Gina was an MMA champion turned actress but it all made sense later when I learned this.  What a nice change and a great movie idea!
0545265355|5.0|This was a wonderful series.  They were the type of books that called to you all day begging to be read.  The characters soon became part of your family.  These book should appeal to readers of all types of genres.
1439156816|5.0|\\"I confess, I've only read ABOUT Stephen King's novels â\\" his genre isn't mine. However, I enjoyed this book and found a new respect and empathy for an author I considered too creepy for my time.<br /><br />King has three parts of the book â\\" C.V.(and why he writes) What Writing Is (The main part) and On Living - A Postscript. As others have mentioned the C.V. is a gift from an author who hasn't been a personal show off. The postscript is a moving report of courage and determination.<br /><br />I did like this book; I'm not sure I haven't read and read and read the information on writing in other books, but King puts it succinctly and reinforces those axioms we've been taught. I also learned the best thing for good writing â\\" leave out the boring stuff and than pheasants are more appetizing than peasants.<br /><br />Read at least a book a week and make this one of them.\\"

030758836X|1.0|Gone girl is like a complex chardonnay, each sip lingering on your tongue, wanting more.  Then you get to the last sip, and you find a worm in the bottom of your glass.  You just want to gag.  All those aromatic flavors that tickled your brain are overwhelmed by a grub!<br />The characters are three dimensional, the plot is tight, the style is unique, and the story is balanced with just the right amount of angst and humor and then...  Obviously, Gillian Flynn dosen't share my philosophy of ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL!

B004WR125O|2.0|I have the Onkyo TX-NR609 and wanted to use its DLNA abilities to stream music wirelessly from my computer. I assumed the best solution was to use the official WiFi adapter to do so, but that turned out not to be the case. This thing's reception is poor, regardless of the router used. Playback would frequently skip, severely disrupting the listening experience. If you're thinking about getting this, I recommend you look at the TP-Link TL-WN722N instead. It is a compatible alternative as it uses the same wireless chipset, but is far better at doing its job than this official adapter.  THE ONKYO UWF-1: EXPERIENCES AND TROUBLESHOOTING  The router I used at first was a Linksys 160N, which is quite dated and by far not the best performer.The signal was weak, averaging 40% and sometimes dropping to 30% despite being only one room away. Figuring that my router was the problem, I upgraded to the Netgear WNDR3800. My signal jumped to an average of 60%, occasionally dropping below that. Skipping was somewhat less frequent, but the problem was not resolved. The manual and other reviewers suggest using an uncrowded WiFi channel for optimal performance. The Netgear WNDR3800 has a &#34;Clear Channel Selector&#34; feature which switches to less busy 2.4 GHz channels automatically. I also live in my own house and the WiFi around my area isn't particularly crowded either. Despite these conditions, this thing demonstrated consistently poor performance.  THE TP-LINK TL-WN722N: UNOFFICIAL, BUT FAR SUPERIOR ALTERNATIVE  The TP-Link TL-WN722N uses the same chipset (Atheros AR9271) as the UWF-1 and is compatible with the Onkyo TX-NR609 as well as, I assume, any other receiver that recommends usage of a wireless adapter using said chipset. The TP-Link adapter features a detachable antenna and comes with a USB cord. When using it, my signal climbed to around 95%, occasionally hitting 100%. Suffice to say it was an incredible improvement compared to the official Onkyo adapter. That said, upgrading my router also boosted my signal with the UWF-1, so the improvement is not exclusively due to the TL-WN722N. I still get skipping, but much more rarely.When using the TP-Link adapter, playback skipping drops dramatically and streaming music becomes the (mostly) pleasant experience it ought to be.  THE BOTTOM LINE  Forget the official Onkyo UWF-1 adapter and get the TP-Link TL-WN722N instead. There is absolutely nothing the former does that the latter doesn't do significantly better.it's WPA2 with AES. Yes, both adapters worked with this setup.

B002BX4VEK|5.0|This 2-disc set is Elvis' best studio recording.  The production is lean and Elvis reaches back to the heart of what made him great.  The two-day recording session launched an avalanche of hits in 1969.  He was never better.
0345803485|2.0|Great service, pretty steamy book - I did not like this book - maybe I would like the trilogy but I thought it was kind of juvenile.  The main female character acted a little too naive for her age in the 21st century.  I will not be reading the rest of the series.
B0086700CM|3.0|This game is pretty good except that it lags quite a bit and it is really annoying.Please fix the lag!
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Clockwork Angels is a great album and essential for all Rush fans. Snakes & Arrows was a solid release but it had a couple songs that were just average. Clockwork Angels offers everything they did in the past from classics like 2112, Hemispheres, Moving Pictures and modern Rush from all the way up to Snakes & Arrows. Headlong Flight sounds like it came from Caress of Steel which they haven't followed the rawer, heavier progressive metal direction until now. However it doesn't have any of the electronic-era Rush or synthesizer which I've never been a huge fan of. It has a good variety and diversity but it sounds most like the traditional Rush (late '70s and early '80s progressive rock). Clockwork Angels has a quality and clean production, good songwriting and is a consistent album through out. It starts of great and gets better towards the end. They haven't disbanded and are still making quality music after being around for over 38 years and aren't going to quit anytime soon. The 21st Century has been a great era for Rush and Clockwork Angels is perfect for the new decade, one of the best albums to come out in the '10s yet.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Why is it that when men view net porn it's an \\"addiction,\\" but female porn lit like this is supposedly \\"literature\\"? Let's be fair now, shall we? When a gal becomes a bit \\"flushed\\" \\"down there\\" and needs a release of her \\"inner goddess\\" there is no better porn than this, but let's not pretend it's a \\"story\\" any more than vid porn, okay? Because the story, if any, is secondary to its primary purpose, i.e., making women \\"blush,\\" \\"murmur,\\" and, eventually, \\"grin.\\"
0385523394|1.0|Not everyone who goes to prison should write a book about it.  Piper Kerman lacks the sensitivity and insight that good writers possess.  Instead of giving her readers a genuinely authentic experience of being locked up, we hear about how she is such a great person. It was as if she had something to prove, such as, \\"yes, I went to prison, but I am actually quite fabulous, I'm attractive, I have a great boyfriend, wonderful interesting friends and family who think I'm wonderful and even though I'm so amazing, it never occurred to me to judge the pathetic women I'm locked up with.  We're all the same, except I'm better.\\"  I was not impressed and at times I was a little nauseated.  If you're curious, you can go to her website and watch videos of her interviews and you'll see what I mean.  Also, she got a year for a very serious crime.  Had she not been white, had family that paid for a pricey lawyer, she would have gotten a much lengthier sentence.  No, there is no justice in this world.
0486414124|4.0|Having read all of Austen's novels, and letters, and unfinished works (not to mention sequels and mashups),  I'd have to say Northanger Abbey is my favorite book, second only to Pride and Prejudice.<br /><br />I've read it twice and will probably re-visit it again at some point.<br /><br />Catherine Morland is a quirky, young, and likable character.  Some have said that her personality is closest to the Austen herself.  Scholars have pointed out similarities which I won't bore you with.<br /><br />It's the shortest of all the finished six Austen novels and as a Janeite (a lover of Austen), I advise my friends (the ones that ask) should they want to read Austen, they should start with Northanger Abbey.<br /><br />It's quick and satirical and you'll love Catherine Morland and Henry Tilney, young romantics.  And since it's short, you'll get acclimate yourself with Jane's voice and by the end will be ready to take on more.<br /><br />i won't got into the story, but basically, Catherine has a great imagination which gets her into a bit of trouble; she has a talkative day friend; but Catherine's goodness is clear and shines through.

B007V2UGPE|4.0|the game is fun and I like all the upgardes available and all the charms. it's a great game but recently my data was deleted, for no reason. other than my data being deleted, this is a very addictive game.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|It drives me NUTS that this book is so popular.<br /><br />Like others, I was interested in it because of the raves surrounding the book and those around me were enthralled.  Although the description of the story was just ok, I went a head and bought it anyway.  Paying the outrageous price of $9.99 was my my 1st mistake.  Not getting the sample as I usually do was my 2nd mistake.  Well, I managed to read a few chapters and the whole time, I kept wondering what was wrong with everyone.  How could a novel with such juvenile writing be on the best-seller's list?<br /><br />The only reason I can believe that readers would find this book exceptional is because they have never read an erotic romance and this book is their first experience moving past the vanilla in modern day romance novels.  Granted, if this was my only example of an erotic romance, I might feel the same.  However, ladies and gentlemen, let me assure you that if you had ANYTHING of substance to actually compare this drivel to, it would not have been given 4-5 star ratings and it definitely wouldn't have made the best-seller's list.  If you thought this novel was good, then do yourself a HUGE favor and continue your exploration of the erotic romance genre.

030758836X|5.0|This has got to be the best edge-of-the-beach towel read for summer 2012, but it's a masterful, memorable, brilliant, unusually clever novel for any season.<br /><br />  Gone Girl is just so far ahead of its genre, combining epic plot twists with astute psychological insight into relationship psychology, plus fine sentence-by-sentence writing that sometimes compels one to stop reading and savor the words.<br /><br />  Just a bloody brilliant theft of my life and consciousness, really.<br /><br />  I think I am not alone in finding the ending a bit disappointing, even while finding that the author has made it seem inevitable.<br /><br />  But I will recommend this to anyone I know who loves the kind of book that sweeps them off their feet but doesn't make them feel stupid afterward for succumbing.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Reviews for music are useless. This is in my opinion Rush's best release yet. Does that make it so? no. The musicianship is certainly \\"upped\\" a notch or two beyond Snakes and Arrows.. the songwriting on this record is really great as well. Some of the solos \\"shine\\" ala Bravado, Open Secrets, etc.. apparaently recorded as throw-aways (Alex's best work is done like this). I feel the guitar SHINES on this record, but the entire effort is well-done. The band was careful this time around to step up their playing and it shows (compared to Snakes and Arrows), but doesn't feel contrived or \\"Dream Theater-esque\\" (sophistication for the sake of sophistication).
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Assuming that I have at least 200 Mbs, Splashtop does a very good job streaming video from Windows Media Center.  This is an excellent way to see my video library and even over the air broadcast TV remotely on my Kindle Fire.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Despite how often we seem to get wrapped up in created universes whether it be written (books), coded (video games), or filmed (tv/movies) it isn't as often that you see one created with this much care. If only just finished this one and I already can't wait to pick up book two. It makes me want to have been involved with this world sooner (only I was eleven when this book came out).<br /><br />Martin writes in his acknowledgements that \\"the devil is in the details...a book this size has a lot of devils\\" though from reading it you would never know this fact unless you read what he had to say about it. The story is perfectly woven together and it pulls you in for all 800 pages.<br /><br />Martin's been called the American Tolkien though I feel like this does him a disservice. Martin's writing is much more fluid, easier to follow, and most of of all, more fun to read. This isn't a review to bash Tolkien but I do feel as though he is given too much credit for his complexities while Martin manages to create an equally vivid world without having to read the same paragraph over and over again to hash out all of the details.
B0088RQ4X4|4.0|I'm not a good movie reviewer and don't want to try and be one.  But I almost didn't watch this movie because of all the negative publicity.  Two hours is a very long movie for me, but I didn't squirm  once through the whole time.  I found it very enjoyable.  Glad I took a chance.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|This game is fun and will keep you entertained as long as your battery is running. As for force closes they very rarely happen in the newer version.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I must admit that I was raised on Rush, along with other intellectually challenging minds, such as Pink Floyd, Erwin Schrödinger, George Orwell, Leonardo da Vinci, Nikola Tesla, Robert Frost, Arthur C. Clarke, Friedrich Nietzsche, Sigmund Freud, Albert Einstein, John F. Kennedy and Winston Churchill, among many, many others.  You get the picture.  My intellectual upbringing, if not eclectic, was diverse as it was challenging.  It was Rush who enabled me, broadened my horizons; always leaving me for want of more, no matter how it was presented.  In the absence of Rush and their influence in my life from the moment at the age of nine I first \\"studied\\" 2112 in 1976.  It was introduced to me, quite accidentally, when I saw the vinyl album sitting on my uncle's bed that memorable year.  At first, I didn't understand the 2112 (side A) portion of it, but after weeks, its dark and hopeful narrative was more meaningful, more foreboding, than anything I had ever watched or read up two that time.  Of course, the second side proved quite entertaining to a naive, but relatively intelligent young man.  And no, I had no concept of drugs, per se.  I was quite content to listen \\"Passage to Bangkok\\" and take away an exotic train voyage through a wondrous far eastern country.  Though I did often wonder what that stuff was that I could often smell emanating from my uncle's room.  Oddly, that same smell seems to permeate whatever venue at which Rush plays when I'm in attendance.  Very strange.  Coinidence, perhaps?  How times change...<br /><br />That aside, without the epic story of 2112, such complexity may never have invigorated my mind the way it magically occured.  I may never have took it upon myself to study some of the great works of the influential people I mention at the beginning of this review.  If you are still reading this, and you 'get it', you are probably wondering why I haven't mentioned the supposed 20th Century philosopher, Ayn Rand, to whom the 2112 opus is practically dedicated.  Truth-be-told, The Fountainhead was among the first book I read after absorbing the 2112 saga.  I found that book, for lack of better terms, pretentious, overly-complex, and written with a clear social agenda (then again I could have been a wee young for such philosophical concepts).  Though Neil Peart (the band's virtuoso drummer and lyricist) may be a fan of her work, it was (and still is) clear that he extracted some admittedly pertinent and valid social commentary found in the pages of Rand's works and allowed those to not only influence 2112, but many of his later efforts (primarily the enlightenment of an individual who then \\"takes-on\\" the (typically Orwellian or Totalitarian) power-elite).  In my personal intellectual voyage, when it comes to Rush, Mr. Peart's occasional brushing with this theme throughout the years always brings a smile to my face.  I'm uncertain as to whether-or-not Rush influenced my life to the extent that this review (which has YET to mention Clockwork Angels1!) might signify, but I grew-up (a subjective term, as my wife and children say I have yet to) to become a systems engineer, serving in the United States Army as such), serve as an adjunct professor at Campbell University, earn a graduate degree, write seven volumes of poetry (one of which is still in print and available on Amazon, and one (Casting Shadows) due to be published this summer, one textbook (The Extracted MBA, still in print and on Amazon), among other interests).  This begs the question: are my published works of poetry akin to me serving as a Neil Peart lyrical cover band?  I would categorically say no.  If you have read me drone on this far, send me a note to castingshadowsbook [at] gmail.com and I will send you a free e-copy of Vapours of Promise so you may serve as judge, jury, and (gulp) executioner. :-)<br /><br />As a life-long fan of Rush, a group that defies classification into any known genre, it was with the greatest of anticipation that I awaited receipt of their latest work, Clockwork Angels.  I had the pleasure of reading much in the press regarding this forthcoming release, all almost ubiquitously positive.  The three songs Rush released, \\"Caravan\\", \\"BU2B\\", and \\"Headlong Flight\\", whetted my appetite, to say the least.  When I heard confirmation it was going to be a bona-fide concept album, I was simply floored!  After all this time, the \\"old\\" men were going to release a full-on concept album.  What struck me further was the fact they has said at one point many years ago that they would never release such an album again.  Not to belabor a point, but they also said they would never release an album like the masterful Moving Pictures again...  To them I say: there are plenty of years left in you three gentlemen...  When 'Caravan' and 'BU2B' were released in 2010, I, along with thousands of fans were thrilled.  These two songs showed us collectively that Rush was not only still firing on all cylinders, but that the \\"Rush Engine\\" was fully tuned and capable of maximum horsepower (at some parts, it seems like Clockwork Angels is on turbo!).  Thankfully, my iPod had no moving parts, for surely they would have quickly worn-down as I played these songs over and over, ad-nauseum.  I finally came to my senses and mixed the songs with their other great works, but still...  Then, just a couple of months ago, Rush released 'Headlong Flight', upping the ante over the first two songs released for this album.  And what a song 'Headlong Flight' is!  Interestingly, even armed with the knowledge that Clockwork Angels was to be a concept album, I could draw no logical correlation between the three songs lyrically.  Each was magnificent on its own.  One would assume that a song released from the latter part of the album would have little contextual meaning, but there it was.  Son number nine, Headlong Flight, standing out on its own perfectly well on all levels.  I now believe that was Rush's point...  I was, however, wary.  Granted, two years is a long time to allow us to suckle on the fruits of an upcoming album, how many of us have been a tad disappointed in the last 20 years or so when Rush releases a song or few prior to an album's release, only to find they were usually the meat-and-potatoes of the album itself?<br /><br />Friends, after a thorough several listens of Clockwork Angels, I am here to report that we have entered an entirely new phase in the nearly 40-year career of Rush.  More significant than the transition between 2112 and A Farewell to Kings.  Even more significant than the interesting (and controversial) transition between Moving Pictures and Signals.  What we have before us is like nothing else Rush (or any band I know of) has ever accomplished.  From the first clatter of the steam train on Caravan through the gentle, probing thoughts of The Garden, Clockwork Angels is, in-fact, an engrossing concept album that spends well its 66 minutes telling the tales, adventures, and misadventures of a protagonist in the Steampunk tradition where technology has advanced as an alternate history that minimizes or eliminates electric or electronic development (sorry Mr. Gordon Moore and your coveted Moore's Law that gave us the world as we know today (and a career for the likes of me, no less!)).  Neil Peart's lyrics tell this remarkable and adventurous story, while Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson craft music around them in a manner that seems almost superhuman.  Never in my three-decade-plus of listening-to and analyzing their music have Rush, in my opinion, produced such a polished, complex, profound, meaningful, and most importantly, integrated piece of work as this.  Ever.  The only song I can think of that illustrates when I mean wasn't even a full song.  It was La Villa Strangiato off the Hemispheres album, which was ironically their last true concept album.  The diversity of music and lyrical ambiguity (except BU2B2) indeed conspire to enable each and every song to standon its own, if need be.  Even more fascinating, and I don't know if this is intentional, I find the more I listen to Clockwork Angels, it gets progressively (pardon the pun) better from beginning to end.  That alone is mind-blowing to me, as I have never seen them (or anyone) do it on any of their albums (the original Rush album had elements of this, but I suppose most of us discount much pre-Peart Rush).  I have always found myself enamored with what we 'old farts' called \\"Side A\\", but Clockwork Angels gives and keeps giving, like an old steam train lurching from rest and chugging its way to cruising speed, headed for The Garden, pulling forty years and hundreds-of-thousands of us along for the ride.  I love Caravan.  But Caravan is just pulling out of the station.  If your steam train doesn't have seat belts, I suggest you grab something sturdy.<br /><br />The ride has just begun.<br /><br />-Congratulations Geddy, Alex, and Neil-
B007J4T2G8|5.0|So much more to this trilogy than the controversy about it. Very well written story line and characters. Did not want this love story to end.
B0086700CM|4.0|it lags too much on my kindle folire and it glitches. runs toooo fast in the beginning too. and every time I jump... please fix
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wow, I was really desperate for a new read one day so I started looking in different places. I downloaded the kindle app and somehow came across the star force series by B.V.Larson. I was so impressed I looked for similarly talented peers and came acroos the Wool Omnibus by Hugh Howey. I must say that I was literally blown away by how talented these little known (but not for long) authors are. Wool is a compelling story with great characters and the kind of ongoing tension that I have always associated with the best thriller and horror stories. The protagonist, Juliette is, well, wonderful. You'll fall in love with her. Great work, destined to become a classic I think. Congrats Hugh.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I am very disappointed.  Bought it because everyone is talking about these books at work, and I enjoy a good romance/erotica novel.  I myself am not the best writer, but I enjoy reading.  The overall plot was good and moved quickly, but I did find myself a little bored sometimes, wanting to skip pages and move on.  The quality of this book is just poor.  I agree with others who've said that the writer is mixing up British jargon in a conversation between American college students.  Anastasia is such a ridiculous character as well.  Not knowing how to use a computer?!? Please, the girl is supposed to be graduating with a degree in English literature.  I think that as this trilogy has gained popularity, it has come under more scrutiny, and frankly, it's awful. I was glad to see so many negative reviews here. Glad to know I'm not the only one.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I can't stop playing it, super fun, just another game I've now become hopelessly addicted to. I only wish it didn't take so long to get your energy up.
B00881VLCE|4.0|easy and fun. not enough of a variety of puzzles. could use more animals.  dogs and birds maybe some trees and flowers without the babies.
B0088P2A7A|4.0|Great app but kind of unnecessary. Googling something usually brings you to wikipedia anyway. I was hoping it would have a &quot;random&quot; button like the wikipedia homepage.
B0086700CM|4.0|luv it! mostly because this game is so fast-paced and you may never know what may happen next!  officially hooked!!! &lt;3
B0072OFM28|5.0|Spartacus Vengeance is definitely a different season than its predecessors containing new actors, new locations, and a new script.  However different isn't always better; so how does the 2nd season of Spartacus add up?  Well, the answer to that question is simply: great.  New Spartacus actor Liam McIntyre has filled the role of Whitfield with humility, grace, but as important, with ability.  The writers have maintained the same grip over the audience as they had with Arena & Blood and Sand.  The difference & progression of the season is enough to keep you enthralled, but still has that touch that fans have come to love.  I give the season a 5/5 because of my own love for the show, and acceptance for any & all argued flaws (those being story related and minimal at best).  With Spartacus having already amassed a total of three seasons and its finale slated to release 2013, there is little question that Starz has sponsored a successful show that has captured fans from the sands of the arena and to open rebellion.  I recommend the second season and wait eagerly for the War of the Damned 2013.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is possibly the most child-like book Anyone has ever read. If your a teenager and have yet to experience the wonderful joys of sex... this book is for you. But if your an adult who has experienced the... disappointment of sex and understand how realistic it is then this book is not for you. Sure if your a teenager this will seem like the perfect man:<br /><br />Rich<br />Fit<br />Charming<br />Dominating<br />And a sexual thrill<br /><br />But for an adult, All the holes in this story pop out to you. First of all. He never worked. He owned a billion-not million dollar company, yet he never once stepped foot in his company throughout the book. Never once said he had to work. He seemed to have all the time in the world to focus on the girl.<br /><br />Second, He never worked out. He talked about all the things he did all the time but he never did any of them. This book was filled with her murmur's as well. It was \\"Yes sir\\" \\"Sorry sit\\" \\"Please\\" She never really talked to him. If you put all the times she ever talked in this book you'd have a whole paragraph. The person who wrote the book, obviously never had sex or masturbated in her entire life. She literally cum's when he says her name. \\"He breathed my name on my neck and I...\\" Come on now. She obviously was a nun in her past life if she ejaculates at a drop of a hat. Yes. He's a thrill if your a teenager. But as an adult. He's just unbelievable.
B006ONOVFM|5.0|Fabulous book. I couldn't  put it down, I found it very addictive reading. Part of a fantastic series, I highly recommend it.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I was hooked from the first page as I followed a hired hit-man take out his targets.  When things go wrong, it ends up with a struggle for not only the main protag, Will Robie's life, but also for that of a teenage girl who crosses his path not far into the book.<br /><br />Baldacci skillfully weaves multiple story lines to an exciting conclusion.  A definite must read for Baldacci fans.
B006VA57CY|5.0|I, too, watched the first episode and was hooked.  I then proceeded to watch all of Season one.  I waited a day or two, then purchased all of Season two.  I've been trying to savor each one because I know Season three is not yet out.  I suppose I will have to start all over with Season one and repeat until Season three is ready.  I must, because after watching this series I am completely spoiled.  No other program seems to meet all my viewing needs in quite this way.  Perhaps I'm addicted to Dowton Abbey.  I believe I am.
B00881VLCE|2.0|It was not at all what I thought ut was going to be the professional was easy as the beginning....nit enough room on any screen...was bored and back at the apps looking for solitaire in 15 minutes.
B0088RQ4X4|4.0|I have to admit that, like many, I took a pass on the theatrical version, mostly out of apathy.  I was turned off by the Conan the Barbarian outfits and the seemingly cheesy CGI work that I saw in the trailers.  However, after watching the film on Amazon Instant Video (admittedly, I still went the cheap, non-HD route), I walked away quite impressed with the movie.<br /><br />In short, as many reviews have noted, many of the themes in JC are familiar.  In fact, folks like George Lucas clearly lifted many of their themes and action pieces from John Carter, if the movie is in fact representative of the book. (Which I intend to read at some point on my Kindle.) Unlike George's underwhelming prequels, though, the film had very entertaining characters, an extremely strong and well-motivated female lead, and even children's elements (the dog-alien) that didn't insult the viewer with lowbrow humor.  In short, this is the movie that The Phantom Menace should have been.  In a fair world, JC would have made the $700M that TPM did, while TMP languished.  Sadly, that was not to be.<br /><br />In the end, I have the feeling I'll pick up the Blu-ray in the near future.  It's a film with great action, pretty doggone good CG effects (the Tharks and the dog-alien are very enjoyable, even if they're not 100% believable), and an excellent score.  I dropped the film by one star mainly because I felt that Taylor Kitsch lacks the charisma to be a leading actor and he pulls the movie down when it should have soared.  He has the physicality, but simply not the emotional or acting depth to make John Carter more than a 2D character in a 3D film.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|best free game possibly. I love it. w ow wow wow that's what it is like. though it gets although it gets Mindanao tough at the end
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I can't recommend this highly enough - superb characters, utterly believable, well thought through and to the best of my knowledge, completely original - $6 is an absolute steal!
B0038BBA4I|5.0|What an amazing record! \\"Sigh No More\\" is an exciting collection of finely crafted, passionate folk rock songs.  The lyrics thought-provokingly (but not preachily) address the struggles of man with life, love and faith.  Totally blown away by this record, which I initially overlooked due to the excessive hype it seems to have gotten.  Believe the hype and buy this album!
1400052181|5.0|The story of the \\"establishment\\" stealing from Henrietta Lacks and her family is beyond infuriating. \\"First do no harm\\" was around long before this point in time and should have been applied across the board. The story of some lives being more valuable than others lives on in the 21st century. That said, much has been done to further human subject protection in the US for people who participate in clinical research. Often times the sickest people know they don't stand to benefit from current research, but yet they participate anyway so that people that come after them might not suffer. A poignant, well told/written story that everyone should read!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really like how they have so many games! I also like how they get special deals! it helps a lot!

B005LAIH3G|3.0|John Carter from Edgard Rice Burroughs. Tarzan and all is a movie for kids. Me, I am a senior but I am hooked on 3D movies. Plus, I like/love sci-fi. However, there is no real 3D in this sci-fi flick.  Paid big bucks to see 3D not a 2D movie.<br /><br />The movie had syntax. Lynn Collins, Porsche in The Merchant of Venice makes for a talented princes. The hero figure, Taylor Kitsch cut enough with a real good face<br />makes the grade in hero medal. My opinion is that his Martian dog, a Pit Bull Frog was the best thing in the entire movie. This pet, Pit Bull Frog was adorable. I want one.<br /><br />The studios are ripping off the public left and right with sky-high admission prices for 3D and airing 2D movies in 3D's stead.<br /><br />Since I bought two 3D TVs from amazon I have noticed just about every single 3D movie I have bought lacks in 3D photography.<br /><br />Buy porn on occasion. The porn industry is light years ahead of the main stream studios in 3D filming. The main stream movie studios are lying and swindling their patrons with this is 3D scam. I think there should be a class action lawsuit filed against the major studios for fraudulent activities.  And the educational movie makers are light years ahead of the major studios in 3D movie making too.<br /><br />If the damn film ain't in no 3D then the damn studios have no right to say it is 3D.<br /><br />The movie was entertaining. That is what counts. I would not have bought this package knowing it was not in 3D.
B0086700CM|4.0|I have to say, this is a very fun game, and i strongly suggest downloading it. Although, there are some things you should know before you make your decision. The fist ciuple of times that I played Temple Run, it was fine. But after a few days, I touched the app to open it up and play it, and it completely froze at the point where it has the temple backround and says 'Imangi Studios'. I waited for about five minutes, and it did not do anything . I had to completely shut down my kindle, and i tried the apo the next day. It has done that 3 or 4 times, but all you have to do is hold down the power bugton and shut down your device.<br />  That is the only issue i have had with this app, snd other that that, it is perfectly fine and an amazing game :).
B0054JZC6E|5.0|So many games. I love it. I wish I could play it all day :) its so fun!!! play it!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app. I began using reading plans several months ago and have found that I can set out to read my Bible daily and actually follow through! God has used my readings to show me His plans and comfort my soul recently. this app has created a great way to be in this world of technology but not of it.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|This game was kind of fun initially but got really redundant after a while. All you do is sit there and create families, with many of the latter goals requiring real money. The rate of inflation is also rediculous,  once again practically requiring the infusion of real money. Overall, not bad for a couple of days but a waste of time after that.
B004A8ZX28|4.0|This movie was very good but don't expect non stop action, this is more suspense orientated and complex. Liam was good not great but overall convincing in his role, Unknown will keep your interest through out and on the contrary to what some say I thought the ending was good. I will always tell it like I see it. Scott M
B000GL1BHO|5.0|This is a wonderful little scale model or educational toy. It has about a 9\\" wingspan & is about 2\\" head to tail - just like the product description says. I don't think I would let kids play with it until they are old enough to appreciate it.
B001TODCII|5.0|This was a highly intertaining movie with great photography. The fight scenes were excellent and taken moved at a fast pace with an interesting story, tight script, tight direction, tight acting. This IS a 5 star film if you like a good story that propells the action. I will always tell it like I see it.....Good or bad.<br />Scott M

B007JGAR6U|3.0|I got this unit from Amazon a couple of weeks ago. Looks nice, works well on and off the X10. Good basic analogous control dial. Cannot swivel or pivot. Does not have pre-flash, so Red Eye reduction does not work when used by itself, however can be set for preflash in slave mode. The On/off switch has to be held down for a few seconds to work. It goes off if the camera is not used for some time, will not be ready to use immediately, you have to press and hold the on/off button, even then it may require you to switch off the camera. It will certainly not come On if you mount it on the camera if the camera is On. You have to switch the camera off, mount the flash, put the flash On, then switch the camera On. Only then you can access the greyed out Auto position on the Flash Mode in the shooting Menu. Also, due to High ISO setting and capability of the X Pro1. It may not fire in most conditions in Auto Flash Mode, which means it can shut down and not be available if conditions demand it. So, it has fewer problems with the X10, but has more quirks like the X Pro1, when mounted on it.
0374275637|5.0|This book is a thought provoking analysis of psychology and the influence on economics. Some highlights for me include the following:<br />* We are pre-programmed to attack problems with a practical and easy approach, which is frequently wrong or misguided. To do better, we often need to engage our \\"System 2\\" which can analyze better, but is by nature lazy. We need discipline to challenge our assumptions and rally System 2 into action.<br />* Life as we remember it is what guides our attitudes and decisions. Life as it actually happens (experienced) is warped and filtered. We recall stories and nuggets of data, but we don't do well with integrating experience through time and seeing the bigger picture. The implications for politics and public policy are profound.<br /><br />The last chapter outlines the challenge ahead in educating ourselves in behavioral economics, developing a common language to facilitate dialog, and apply new techniques to real problems. Mr. Kahneman makes a convincing case that this effort will be very worthwhile.
B006RUJST6|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this book. I picked it once again because it was a recommendation and the reviews all seemed positive. Although it did take some convincing because I passed it up a number of times thinking it wouldn't float my boat. It was truly an enjoyable but sad love story. I often found myself crying. There isn't a lot of hot steamy scenes in the book, but the story moved along at such a great pace that it did not need that to keep you interested. I loved the insert of poerty and song lyrics throughout the story. The characters are great especially Eddie. Lake's mom is the mom every young girl wants and gives the best advice. All together it was an enjoyable book that I would recommend to a friend if they are looking for a light read that has a sweet love story. Now I am on to the second book in the series, I am interested to see what that brings.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so fun it took to long to put this game on for free but it was worth the wait i have the worst luck ever with the turns and what not but i like it because it is a challenge for me
B007I2BZIE|5.0|At the risk of heresy, this may be Rush's best album ever. I'm a big fan of their later work, they have transformed from a \\"prog rock\\" band to a straight-ahead \\"rock\\" band. Their musicianship is astounding. Neil Peart doesn't just keep time with the drums, he shows off at every fill. Lifeson and Lee sound like a well-oiled machine, these guys have been playing together for 40 years, and it shows (in a good way).<br /><br />The only concession to Father Timeis Geddy Lee's voice, which no longer sounds like helium man. But this is a good thing, not a bad thing. There is no way to sing in that high register for 40 years (just ask Robert Plant). Geddy's vocal register sounds perfect for the type of music Rush plays. For a band that's been around 40 years, Rush doesn't sound like a bunch of old guys, they sound energized and youthful.<br /><br />The songs on this album are both melodic, heavy, and lengthy (averaging about 5 minutes per song). The production is excellent, all the instruments are pushed well forward in the mix, giving the album a depth and warm sound not common on CDs these days.
B007SWZVBQ|5.0|Every song is well vocalized and performed. Some of the songs I had not heard before but now I<br />like them very much.<br />Not a long CD but the songs chosen are enjoyable.
0451228731|4.0|I love the premise of this series, although it does take it a bit far into geek memes, it does have a solid story to stand on.  The writing was terrific, the action pace well balanced and the characters enjoyable.  Its fine that some might call this a gamers fantasy, I agree it bleeds into that once in awhile, it does so as elegantly as possible.  Well done.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I understand completely the complaints people have about the level of literary prowess.  Yes, the writing could be more mature.  Yes, the language choices could be less repetative but in an effort to stop myself from passing judgment and dismissing the hype over this book, I tried to remember that I never even bothered reading or watching any Twilight book or movie.<br /><br />The main characters are likeable - although not immediately - Anastasia is a typical 21 year old female.  Yes - despite her level of conviction in resisting her submissive side - she is mildly submissive - how else would her own roommate be able to manipulate her so easily?  Anastasia's language and word choices - as repetative as the complainers point out - is purely typical of any 21 year old.  If you think back to listening to a college student, they do not sound like adults of 35+ would.  They use the same sentences and words to exhibit multiple reactions and situations.<br /><br />Christian is a very decent character.  Yes, at first he is a pompous jackass and a controlling psycho - but eventually you start to see that he has issues - much like many of us.  A past that is colored in more black than white.  But in the end of book one you see that there is more to like than dislike about Christian Grey.<br /><br />There are many unbelievable moments throughout the book but if you are familiar with BDSM erotica - this is a very \\"vanilla\\" intro to the lifestyle.  One of the main reasons why this book is to intriguing to so many is that the taboo lifestyle lived by those that are involved in the BDSM community has its own allure.  There is a morbid curiosity of even the most conservative of us out there to see what the heck it is that draws people into the abyss of BDSM.  These books are a very mellow and mild view into that abyss.<br /><br />Terminology is in line with what the community would say to one another in a start up sense.  And the \\"scenes\\" are atypical for a newbie.<br /><br />If readers can remember what it is that they are about to read before buying the book, they would really do themselves a favor by remembering that - If you don't like listening to young women babble and talk in limited terms then obviously this book will iritate you.<br /><br />I, on the other hand, knew better and understood that I am like this but the theme of the book and what it was based on was more intriguing that the complaints.  I do NOT regret spending the $ and enjoyed the 3 books 2 times each.<br /><br />Happy reading - and if you really want BDSM erotica - there are others out there that would really blow your minds - but honestly you will find them on your own when you are ready for that step.
B000ZNRBK4|5.0|There are cheaper hoods for the Nikon 18-55 MM VR DX Lens, but this Nikon HB-45 Replacement Lens Hood for 18-55mm VR Lens fits, works well, is designed for the lens and is eay to use.  Storage on the lens by reversing it is simple. Somehow, I view putting a cheap hood on a $200 lens as a bit silly, since the Nikon product is only $12 more than a cheap one. That's my view, anyway.
B007PAAO0Y|5.0|Soul maestro Bobby Womack was last heard on the Gorillaz \\"Plastic Beach\\" and \\"The Fall\\" albums. \\"Bravest Man In The Universe\\" is his first album of new material in 18 years and is produced by Damon Albarn and Richard Russell (the latter who also worked magic with Gil Scott-Heron on his last album \\"I'm New Here\\").<br /><br />Largely eschewing seventies-style strings, horns and Womack's guitar work for synths and electro beats, the results are never less than spectacular, from the spare booming title track (\\"The bravest man in the universe, is the one who has forgiven first\\"), to the piano-driven \\"Please Forgive My Heart\\" set to twitchy Timbaland-style beats and with a lovely Acoustic coda.<br /><br />\\"Deep River\\" is acoustic Blues/Folk/Soul, \\"Dayglo Reflection\\" features a deadpan Lana Del Ray perfectly contrasting a raspy Womack and is a dreamy song with skittery/cluttery beats, hypnotic strings, and stabs of bass.<br /><br />Every song stands out; the spare harrowing Trip Hop-ish \\"Whatever Happened To The Times\\", a spoken sample of Gil Scott-Heron appears on the interlude \\"Stupid Introlude\\" which segues into the catchy \\"Stupid\\" with twinkly piano, sketchy bass, and lyrics about false preachers.<br /><br />Womack is on stellar form vocally throughout, soulful and authoritative. \\"If There Wasn't Something There\\" is Hip Hop/Soul, the euphoric \\"Love Is Gonna Lift You Up\\" takes you to Church, the lush quivery Jazzy \\"Nothin' Can Save Ya\\" features African songstress Fatoumata Diawara\\" (she appeared on Albarn's \\"Rocket Juice & Moon\\" project), while closing is \\"Jubilee\\", a Gospel style spoken/sung/chant with electro martial beats.<br /><br />Womack sounds perfectly at home sitting atop these 21st Century grooves. Marvelous!

Why this is a must read as it profiles the technological history of the last 30 years that most younger readers would take for granted. And, whether it is the author's style or simply Steve Jobs' life what is most revealing is a study in human nature.  The highs/ lows and tragedy/ glory of a human genius are accurately portrayed.

B000FBFN1U|5.0|A Storm of Swords is the third book in the series that I have read and Martin has never disappointed me ever since. The way the events in the saga turn out always surprises me and this is one of those books that however you may dislike the outcome, you always feel that it was the way things should be.
B0081ELJ7U|5.0|This review is for the Season 4 Arc - NO SPOILERS<br /><br />I truly enjoy this show and have for the entire series. This season took some serious risks and they have paid off. I cannot wait to see the next Season premiere and I know several people who are waiting with me.<br /><br />The bombshell that was detonated in the team dynamic as well as Beckett's decision, both personal and the professional, are going to shake this series up pretty hard.<br /><br />My family have said on more than one occasion that Castle is what I would be if I had a child to raise and I accept the huge compliment both implied and inferred.<br /><br />Watch the entire series from the beginning and decide for your self.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|As you all know, this book has gotten a lot of people talking. Some people say it's the worst book they've ever read for various reasons. Other people say that it is one of the best books they've ever read. No one, so far that I've seen, has had a neutral point of view on it.<br /><br />So for that, this book gets a brownie star from me. Because to be able to shake people up so much to the level of hate or love takes a sort of skill. Maybe not literary skill, but a skill nonetheless.<br /><br />Fifty Shades of Grey by E. L. James doesn't really need a synopsis. Everyone's heard of it. It's a fanfic of Twilight whose characters were given new names Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey. And it replaces the darker side of vampirism with pretty vivid bondage and domination/submission type sex. Which to give James credit, she doesn't really do the really pain filled description until the last part of the book. Kind of like how we don't see Jaws until the end of the movie.<br /><br />I can't see how there is anything good in Christian Grey. He is absolutely the most despicable character I've come across in a while. But I've had a friend in an abusive relationship, she kind of acted like Ana does-- knowing rationally that her boyfriend's obsessive and abnormal and just plain bad, but still going back for more. She's involved in her own kind of S and M ritual with how she lets Christian just make all the rules.<br /><br />We are reminded time after time that Ana has the power. But to me, she is just a girl in a bad relationship. Period. The way he creepily infiltrates into her life, knowing always where she is, getting angry when he is not informed-- complete stalker and bad guy. Then again, I had similar issues with Twilight and the creepy 100 year old guy hitting on the 16 year old virgin.<br /><br />The writing isn't spectacular. James uses the same phrases over and over again, and the sex scenes get repetitive and overdone. She also uses \\"Holy *insert favorite expletive here\\" and I wasn't really into the inner goddess moments. At the same time, I made through the rest of the book and part of me wants to skim through the rest of the series (at the same time, that thought really depresses me) to make sure that Ana ends up okay. She's not my favorite person, but no one deserves that. I'm desperately hoping that Kate's brother will swoop in and save Ana from this horrific life that it seems like she is destined to submit to (no pun intended). Even though there's literally only one sentence about him, he already is so much better than Christian Grey could ever be.here\\" and I wasn't really into the inner goddess moments.

B002HFJ77S|4.0|This book was really fun and cute, and I enjoyed reading it. That being said, it wasn't as fantastic as her other books, and I think it is a little overpriced.<br /><br />For me to give a 5-Star Review, I need to think about the characters when I've finished the book... I need to crave a sequel. I just don't in this case.

B006RUJST6|2.0|I am so disappointed in this book, or at the very least, I feel mislead by all the reviews. I made the terrible mistake of buying the sequel when I bought this book, assuming I'd want it on the flight. Now I'm stuck with it.<br /><br />I'll start with the pros:<br />-Quick read. I read it in one airplane flight<br />-The twists in the plot were unpredictable<br />-The poetry was kinda neat for a change<br /><br />Cons:<br />-I don't feel anything between and for these characters. At least in freakin' twilight I believed Edward and Bella were in love. (I can't believe I've referenced Twilight... I've probably lost all credibility now.) I can totally buy love at first sight, but the character development is so poor that I don't buy into what the author is selling.<br />-Speaking of Twilight... is this book, Slammed, Young Adult Fiction? The plot was so fast and shallow (as in, not deep or complex), that I can't understand a grown woman reading this and thinking it was fantastic.<br /><br />To drive home my point about character development: I've started the sequel, which is told from Will's perspective, and half the time I keep getting confused as to why Layken is talking about herself in the third-person. That's right, the characters are so poorly developed and unremarkable that I can't tell whose voice is whose. I read an average of 5 books a week, and I'm not a moron. I don't blame myself for being confused, I blame the authors poorly developed characters.<br /><br />I'm so bummed I was directed to this book after finishing \\"Love Unscripted\\" and \\"Beautiful Disaster.\\" Slammed doesn't deserve to be in the same category!!! Those were fantastic. For me, to get a 5-Star Review, I need to care about the characters and continue thinking about them well after the book ends.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I found The Night Circus totally enchanting. The author has created a magical world that draws you in and won't let go. Interesting characters, imaginitive plot, and brilliant descriptions make this a wonderful read. Sure there are some flaws--at times the story moves slowly, some characters and motivations aren't as well developed as I'd like, and a few passages had to be re-read to really understand what was happening. None of that mattered because the story was so captivating. Vivid writing brought the circus to life. This is one book I never wanted to end.
0439023513|4.0|Am i alone here or did it seam like the Katniss's secret mission to assassinate President Snow was a complete failure?  What was all that exertion and loss of life for if the rebels pretty much beat them to the mansion?  I got kind of angry when Finnick Odair was killed by the lizard creatures because his character grew on me from the second book to the last.  Same with Prim.  Was her death accidental or intended?  Any thoughts?<br /><br />Overall, i agree with the critical review.  I felt depressed and agitated at the end with more questions than answers.

B00004VXF2|1.0|I literally don't know what to say about this. The title sounds pretty decent, even the artwork doesn't look too bad. But this album has a far big meaning of ear raping, and that's what I feel about this album. It's ear raping!!! Every second of this album is like a kick to my \\"happy-sack\\" every single time I listen to it!<br /><br />The editing is a mess. I would be more forgiving if the editing was great, but it's not! I felt like Lou Reed just wanted an album that'll torture people until their heads explode!! There's not much to talk about because the whole album is a big compilation of loud and obnoxious noises!!<br /><br />But the worst thing about this album is it's SOOOO BOOOOORING!!! With the album's painful length, and messy production, it feels like a very very long album!!! Every time I look at the time on my cell phone, only a few minutes go by, and the fact that there's an hour of nothing but screeches, squeals, and noises makes it even worse.<br /><br />This is the worst people!! This is literally the WORST album I've ever heard in my entire life, and that's worth saying alot because I've listened to alot of bad music!! Words can't describe how horrible this album is!!! And for those who thinks Lulu is worse, I dare you to play this album with the volume turned up really high, wear earphones, and listen to the whole album at one sitting!! I defy the day i've ever listened to it, it gets worse everytime I listen to it, and I spit at this album's grave!!! *SPIT*

B007J4T2G8|1.0|My review will work on two fronts.<br /><br />Firstly, how is it that someone who writes a Twilight fan fiction that she passes off as an original can be published while so many writers out here can write with far more originality and better language are never published?  It is a vexing position similar to when one has been working to get promoted in a company and yet some half-wit comes in and is suddenly taken up to the highest office even though they have no training and no experience whatsoever that qualifies them for that position.<br /><br />Secondly, with the subject matter that this \\"novel\\" deals with it does raise a pretty prominent point that should be addressed: do so many women out there want to be sexually taken advantage of without consent?  I bring this particular point up because that's what this book sounds a lot like in which a woman wants to have her freedom taken away by a man who is rich and handsome.  Almost seems to go into a more brutal form of a prince charming sort of fantasy.  Which does go to prove something that the comedian Bill Maher once said, \\"There are no such things as 'mutual fantasies' between men and women.  Yours bore us while ours offend you.\\"<br /><br />While I'm on the subject there are two books that go into similar themes that are far better than this.<br /><br />First is \\"The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty\\" by Anne Rice which is pretty much the Prince Charming fantasy with BDSM in it.<br /><br />Secondly is \\"Bad Behavior\\" by Mary Gaitskill<br /><br />Two stories that are wonderfully written and done by women of far greater maturity than to stoop to passing off a Twilight fan fiction as something original.

B0074MZSPO|4.0|Alabama Shakes have fired off a bold opening statement of purpose with the raw, passionate, and hook-laden 'Boys & Girls'.  It's as powerful a debut album as Ive heard in a long time.  Polished it's not, and perhaps that's part of it's considerable charm.  This band is not aiming for studio perfection or sterile tightness.  Instead, they play with a youthful passion, energy and groove that is exciting and welcome to hear.  Their comittment to the songs is undeniable, as if their lives depended on it.  Brittany Howard is a force of nature with a maturity well beyond her years.  I would hate to think she's experienced even a portion of the pain she so convincingly expresses on many of these heart wrenching tracks.  If this band is writing songs as good as 'Hold On', 'Hang Loose', and 'Be Mine' on their first album, one can only imagine what classics are yet to come.<br /><br />Reading the many reviews here, it surprises me there are detractors of the records Lo Fi sound quality.  That quality fits this record to a T.  I love the way it sounds like it was recorded in a cavernous rehearsal hall with an abundance of natural reverb and distortion, with the band just ripping away, having a blast.  The record has a vintage feel that recalls the great loud british blues records of the late 60's, while also evoking the sweet soul feel of the Stax Volt records of that era.  This is not an audiophile record to be analysed.  This is rock & roll record to be enjoyed!<br /><br />I bought the vinyl, which also comes with a bonus 7\\" single with 3 songs (Heavy Chevy rocks!) and a download code.  The pressing is clean, flat, and sounds great, especially when cranked.  Although I'm sure the CD sounds fine, Vinyl seemed like the logical way to experience this Lo Fi Gem.
1595141979|5.0|This book had more action to it than the others. The school has paired Dhampirs with Moroi as if they are in the real world. The administators are acting as the Strigoi and are randomly attacking the students to test their reflex skills. So with the mock fights there is a lot of action going on through out the book. On top of that Rose has started to see ghosts. She has no idea why she's seeing ghosts and what it means but something doesn't seem right. Add in a trip to the Royal Court, two real Strigoi attacks and two huge surprises at the end and you have got yourself one hell of a story.<br /><br />I don't know where to begin. After the way Frostbite ended I didn't know what to expect between Dimitri and Rose. He has certainly lowered his defenses a bit and he has been around her a lot more. For instance when she gets in trouble during a mock fight and is given community service at the church, Dimitri shows up to help her with it. You could see that he was opening up a little bit more to her.<br /><br />The only thing I cannot get out of my head is the ending though. Boy does Mead know how to leave you hanging. First you're like \\"OMG I cannot believe that just happened!\\" and then BAM \\"WHAT?! How did that happen?\\"... \\"Oh no, that's not good.\\".... \\"Yes kill those Strigoi!\\"... \\"No! No! No! Are you f*&'ing kidding me?! No!\\"... The end. I mean talk about emotional ending. Out of the entire book I think that the ending took the cake for me. I got goosebumps reading the highs and lows all in a matter of chapters. I cheered, I got nervous, I cheered again, then got sad, then things were looking up and then Wham Bam Thank You Ma'am I was thrown off my a** and didn't know what the hell happened.

B0083GQKQG|2.0|First, this nature vs. nurture thing is hogwash!!!  Was THAT the point of this movie?!?!  I agree with at least one of the other reviewers who wrote that MANY children have much more difficult childhoods, and NEVER end up killing another living creature.  What about parent(s) who are gone all the time for whatever reason(s)?  How can a child bond with a parent that is physically not even living with them?  I guess that means children who live in an environment like that will become psychopaths as well.  Ugh.  Whatever...<br /><br />It's a random thing, plan and simple.  The mother simply does not know how to handle the situation, and receives no support whatsoever in trying to identify and/or address her son's behaviors.<br /><br />All that being said, the most significant thought I had after the movie, during the movie, etc. was that there was just something MISSING.  I don't know what it was.  Maybe a lack of dialogue, maybe it was the HUGE jump in time from when he was about 7 or 8 to being a teenager.  Or the time jump from when the girl was born until she was, um, 5 or 6.  It just seems there were BIG gaps during those times.  Were Kevin's behaviors really supposed to be as sporadic as the movie showed them to be???<br /><br />Before watching the movie, I thought his behaviors were supposed to be more IMPULSIVE, in other words, with no thought - that his actions and behaviors just \\"happened\\" almost without his control.  (Not the best choice of words, but all I can come up with right now.)  Anyway, during and after the movie, (to me) he seemed very cold, very calculated, very PLANNED and intentional.  And with the gaps in time, it made me think that he would go years without doing anything.... almost as if he was waiting for the \\"right\\" moment to hatch and execute his next plan.<br /><br />I don't know, maybe I'm thinking about it too much...
B000Y7U98C|5.0|I''ll start with my review of the film and then talk about how over criticized it is by a lot of people. I think this movie is amazing. The visuals are fantastic, the acting is superb, and I think the plot and execution are great. It's one of my favorite sci fi (that's science FICTION) movies. It's a little confusing at the end and a little open to interpretation as to what happens but I personally like movies like that. What makes this movie fantastic is the atmosphere and the story it puts you in. It suspends any disbelief of the sciences fiction elements that aren't perfectly believable and realistic like a lot of people expect (I really don't get it. It's a movie)  Overall highly recommended movie. I recommend you see it and buy it if you want.<br /><br />Now, I've read a lot of reviews criticizing the science elements of this movie and hating on how unrealistic it is. Like I said. FICTION. This isn't a documentary which is how other people are judging it. It's a movie. Of course in a few years that Sun is not going to burn out. That doesn't make sense. Time travel doesn't make sense. Aliens don't make sense but these are the key plot elements of so many science fiction movies that people worship as perfect. The way this movie uses its world that it creates and its alternate take on what's possible is what is important. They get some facts wrong but it's a movie. I read that they mention that it is -273 C in space when actually it would be -170 or something. It's not a chemistry or astronomy class it's a movie. I understand if the (NO SPOILERS) kind of trippy ending confuses you and you don't like it but that's just how it is and I liked it. Please don't discount this movie because the science isn't classroom accurate. It's a movie. And a damn good one.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|Although you might fall in love Anna's character, the overall quality of the writing in this book is pretty predictable, and not very well written.  It reads like a 10th grade novel.  (Except for the sex, which I don't think is 10th grade appropriate, of course!)  The characters are bland, the situations are not realistic and frankly although the author is likely to find out what it is really like to be wealthy, she obviously had no clue when she wrote this book.  Here are some situations in the book that gave me a great laugh:<br /><br />A wealthy man who drinks mostly white wine.  Really?<br /><br />A wealthy man first orders a glass of wine, but has to be told he \\"has to buy the whole bottle.\\" Duh.<br /><br />A pediatrican that is *so* wealthy she knows and is part of Seattle's elite.  I don't think so.<br /><br />A self made millionaire that has no particular ties to a single industry.  How did he make his money? She's given Mr. Grey Zuckerburg money without a Facebook.  Just a bunch of \\"I own everything\\" line of crap.  Which reads like crap.<br /><br />Grey supposedly makes 100sK / minute.  Whatever.  That was especially sophomoric.  Your editor should have taken that ridiculous line out.  (Book 2)<br /><br />A divorcee married to an \\"extremely\\" wealthy man required Mr. Grey to support her financially.<br /><br />Here in America, she gets half honey.  And if she got half of millions, why is she running a hair salon?  And if she got divorced from a millionaire why is she now broke?  Crap, crap, crap.  Sadly all of this crap is essential to the story line.<br /><br />Let's throw in that said divorcee (broke) is BFF's with unrealistically rich pediatrician.  Why not borrow money from her BFF?<br /><br />Grey owns a condo in Aspen, yet agrees to raffle it off for charity. (Book 2) Really? Because he's too cheap to purchase a condo rental for $5K to raffle off?  Because millionaires like people in their personal space?  I don't think so. Try an actual HOUSE in Aspenhoney, or a LODGE.  That's what REAL millionaires have.  A CONDO in Aspen is what millionaires buy for their TEENAGERS to stay in while their mansion is being remodeled.<br /><br />The pediatrician lives in a mansion in an exclusive area of Seattle.  It would probably cost about $6-8Million.  How does someone making $300K afford that?<br /><br />Anna is a redeemable character.  We feel sorry for her.  We understand her.  She is the only saving grace in this book.  The over rated \\"sex\\" scenes are \\"mommy porn\\" but basically harmless fun.  However EL James should have spent far more time researching business, money, the rich, Aspen, everything and anything having to do with having and spending REAL money before she wrote about it and revealed her ignorance.
B005FLX1HS|5.0|This was my first purchase through Amazon and I had a feeling it wasn't going to turn out good. To be honest, I was amazed at the quality of the product I bought. The disc was in mint condition, no scratches, worker fingerprints, etc. This was the best buy I mad through Amazon and I'm proud to be an owner of a cd giving me the heart-pounding sensations of heavy bass and drops that Skrillex produces. In fact I was listening to Skrillex when I was typing this out.<br />If I could give a 10 out of 5 I would!
B007RRFUHM|3.0|Kimbra is an amazing talent with a terrific voice.  I pre-ordered Vows after previewing a music videos for two songs on the album, which were very good.  Unfortunately, except for those two songs, the rest of the album was forgettable.  Rather than buy the album, I recommend purchasing digital downloads for any songs you may like.  Previews of the songs were not available until after the album was released, so it was not an option for me.  Lesson learned.  I \\"vow\\" not to be lured in again into purchasing an album that fails to live up to its prerelease hype.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I had looked at this app before and was quickly deterred by the 15$ price. I found it on sale for 1$ and quickly grabbed it. This app has been very helpful and I have connected my school google docs account to it. I like the added connectivity to dropbox as well.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|I use it go make small changes to my google docs. The spreadsheet function  works great on the kindle fire.
B005LAIGWS|4.0|This product is full of terrible reviewers who only hate the movie because of its cast, not its quality. Nicholas Cage is annoying, yes, but he barely is himself in this. You watch the film for Ghost Rider, not outstanding acting. And that's EXACTLY what you get. A no holds barred, half evil bastard of an anti-hero who spits fire and beats people with chains. It's full of action and ridiculous stunts that make no sense. Why would you watch a film about a man whose head is on fire if you're going to complain about that? Ghost Rider is pychotic in this one...he toys with victims; almost to the point of being evil. But that's okay. He's a demon. If you're a Ghost Rider fan, you will like this. If you try to apply logic to ANY comic book film (as in the folks who judge The Dark Knight for being illogical...when it's about a man who thinks he's a bat fighting a crazy clown), then just don't watch this. If you want a film that is just pure ridiculous, over the top, adrenaline pumped entertainment, this is what you need.
B003O86FMW|3.0|I enjoyed Collins' first book in the series, The Hunger Games.  I thought it was unique, creative, and a frightening look into a culture obsessed with blood, gore and control.  The second book, however, takes so long to get going!  The first half is repetitive as Katniss sorts out her feelings about Panem, about being a victor from a pool of 22 now-dead peers, and toward the two boys she is being tugged between.  The book really doesn't get going until the second half, and by that point the plot feels rushed.  Even more than at the end of the Hunger Games, the plot is stopped dead in its tracks in anticipation of book three.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this app you make your own Ice Age Village give it a name go to higher levels AWESOME!!!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|fun game to play, although I wish there were levels you could advance through. it progressively gets harder, but the upgrades help. I don't even think you need to spend real money to play. you get enough coins through gameplay for it to still be fun.
B0088RQ4X4|2.0|I had heard this movie was bad, which made me want to see it. I thought to myself, \\"It can't be THAT bad, can it?\\" It can and it was.
B0014VQGX4|4.0|I purchased this toy purely as a model to put on my desk at work.  I'm a civil engineer, so I figured it would be nice to have a construction vehicle on my desk.  It's been a big hit.  I can't speak to the durability of the toy, but it doesn't look particularly strong.  I wouldn't give it to my child to play with in the dirt though, that's for sure.
030758836X|1.0|This book was a terrific read up until the end.  NEVER have a read such a good book with such a thoroughly unsatisfying ending.  Now I know reading it was a waste my time.  The ending is a mean trick or something; I almost felt the author laughing, thinking \\"ha ha, fooled you.\\"  I feel tricked.  Don't bother reading it....you too will be angry with the non-ending.
0345803485|2.0|I admit that I fell for all the news stories and articles about this book. I thought that if everyone (particularly middle-aged women) were reading it, then I should at least know what they are talking about. Unless you are really into those romance novels, this book won't make much of an impact on you. The story line is okay. Innocent girl is romantically linked to multi-billionare. I didn't have a problem with the hard-core sex parts because they were two consenting adults. But was definitely uncomfortable with how Anatasia put up with Christian's mood swings and secrecy, and hoped that my daughter would be smart enough to make smart decisions about who to date, and when to walk away, like Ana. I finished this book, but definitely won't be buying the next ones in the series.
0316098329|4.0|Maybe it's because I have a child about this age, but this book made me think. I'm not sure if i liked it, DIdn't like it, if it made me sad or happy or outraged...I think that's a good thing.
B005Z28M58|5.0|so far all is good, have ordered the season 8 of Desperate Housewives, the deliverys have all been on time and I am very pleased with the service and prices. this  DVD is coming in Oct so I am waiting for it, but got a good price for an early order. Hope my delivery will come as promised. otherwise service on everything else has been A - OKay
0345803485|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. Before picking it up if you didn't know what you were getting into I don't think you were ready. Even with a little of hearing co-workers talk about it I had a pretty good idea of what it was. I will admit I don't think this book is for everyone. Personally I have never been into anything close to this type of book I do more action. But this book covers a little bit of everything though-out all 3 of them. There is a romance, little dirty... alot of dirty and action. After a while I started to skip though \\"the parts\\" and wanted to know what was happening next in the story line. All and all I really enjoyed it!!
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|When I heard that Ridley Scott was doing a prequel to his original Alien, I knew that I would not be disappointed.  What a great film this was regarding the epic story which fits in very well within the Alien universe.  The actors did an amazing job with the characters they portrayed, they give off a very convincing performance which makes you care about what happens to them.  The 3-D effects were the best that I have ever seen.  Usually I don't like 3D in movies, but paying a little extra for the 3-D in Prometheus was well worth it.  Ridley Scott really knew what he was doing regarding the likable characters, epic story, and grand scale of effects which makes this film a classic.  I don't understand why some people nitpick every little detail in this movie. It's a great film/Alien prequel and I highly recommend that you see it.
B0086700CM|4.0|This game is one of the best I've ever played.The only problem I have with this is that the game lags a little and it makes it difficult to play.If this gets fixed then I'll rate it five stars.
0345803485|3.0|Whoever called this mommie porn didn't read the book.  It's explicitly sexual and for some a turn on.  It's about a man who was raised with submissiveness.  He thinks he can only relate to women as submissives in every way.  The disturbing parts were the physical punishments he gave her.  There's an interesting love story that develops.  You have to decide for yourself if you want to read this.  I'm reading book two of this trilogy.
1400069289|5.0|What's great about The Power of Habit is that it clearly states that while we are wired to continue whatever habits we have built for ourselves, we don't HAVE to.  We are not slaves to our brains, though our brains are powerful contenders.  Our brains are immensely smart and capable, but the content of our wills and character can be just as powerful and strong.  It's really a very positive picture of humanity.  Anyone can do anything, if they can learn to self-discipline and use the power of habit for good.
B007SSEU9O|3.0|I grew up in England during Margaret Thatcher's brutal tyranny and persecution of miner's and working class families and this film does not portray her brutality and insensitivity at all! She is portrayed in such flattering terms that it made me angry. So many English people suffered under her Iron rule and she was widely hated by working class and middle class citizens. I love Meryl Streep and watched the film because she was in it but I was deeply disappointed. The acting was good but don't watch this film and think that's the true Margaret Thatcher - it's the Hollywood version.

B005JE7WKI|5.0|When my husband downloaded this movie on my Kindle Fire, I was about to leave the room because it sounded and looked like it could potentially be the most boring and stupid movie on the face of the plant. I'm glad I stayed because my first impression was wrong, this movie is absolutely hilarious. We have been quoting this movie for days and laughing. This movie is so dumb, but in a good way. I hope Tucker and Dale make more movies, because I'm left wanting more!
B0086700CM|5.0|this is a really really really really... awesome game and it works Great on the kindle fire!!!! every one should get it...
B000JMLFLW|5.0|What can I say about this book that hasn't been said before? The story is so well written that it's timeless, one of those few that I will keep and read over and over again. Elizabeth Bennet is smart and sassy, Jane is good and even angelic, Mr Darcy is dashing and brooding. The cast is full of well developed characters who you can't help but embrace. The Bennets, a glass of wine, and a comfy chair. Bliss.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|For all the haters, this movie has symbolism that obviously you weren't able to pick up.  Get some background in religion, philosophy, and mythology.  You don't need much.  Just a little bit more than what The Avengers has to offer you.  This is a classy science fiction film.  If you weren't able to pick up the beautiful cinematography, mood, atmosphere, acting, imagination, story, that is not the film makers fault.  That would be your ignorance.  The movie has no plot hole, nothing contradicts.  It is one of the finest science fiction films to date.  Easily next to Alien, 2001, and Blade Runner. See it again on its own merits.  Treat it as a reboot of the Alien franchise if that helps.
B005P59ANS|5.0|Love my pink LifeProof case! Ordered it on Friday morning and received it first thing Monday!<br />Pros: *Actually is waterproof!<br />*A good warranty on the case!<br />*Stylish case! I love the look<br />*The ease of using my charger or headphones<br /><br />Cons *Only cons are that the screen is a tiny bit delayed with the touch and slightly less sensitive (not a big issue, easy to adjust/look past<br />And<br />*Make sure to completely wipe off your screen and case before closing, because I have a little piece of something just stuck on my screen and it's annoying, but not a major issue. Not with the case, but just my overlooking it!<br /><br />5 Stars!!!

0307352145|5.0|I was reading Quiet: the Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking by Susan Cain on a plane flight to Atlanta. The very extroverted guy next to me started reading over my shoulder and then started to ask me questions about the book. I explained about the book, and then he proceeded to NOT STOP TALKING the entire flight. I was internally laughing. He was a nice guy and I have nothing against extroverts, but I, as an introvert, just wanted to read my book--a book that I have found entertaining, fascinating, and enlightening. This is a stellar book about American culture and humanity at its core. I was devouring it.<br /><br />At first I wanted to read this book just to feel better about myself. I often hate my introverted \\"weaknesses\\" as I viewed them. I wanted to be extroverted. I wished I were different. And as I've read the book, I realized I have succumbed to the American culture that says an ideal way to be is to be extroverted...the \\"extrovert ideal\\" as the author says. The idea that to be successful or fruitful in life (school, work, ministry, or socially), introverts must re-create themselves into extroverts. I have felt this many times in my life. And as I continued reading (the author includes great stories, scientific studies, and research), I began to feel more peaceful about myself.<br /><br />This is not to say that Quiet is an uprising against extroverts. It demonstrates that we all have something to offer. We need balance in our world. We are complex--our make-up, our lives, our circumstances, our choices. We need the introverts and the extroverts from one end of the spectrum to the other, we all have our strengths and weaknesses. And, we also need to recognize that what our culture values does not always reflect what is wise or true. Culture will not just change overnight, but if I feel confident with who I am and how God made me, it will change how I move in the culture I live and I think that will make a difference.<br /><br />Really, Ican't say enough about this book. I had so many thoughts and insights, that this review seems to hardly touch the surface. You'll just have to read it for yourself!
B007U1FEJE|5.0|I've always been a Beach Boys fan, but I purchased this album largely out of curiosity as I was checking out at Barnes and Noble.  I expected the worst.  However, I was shocked to find that it is actually really good.  By the second time through the album I was starting to love each song, and now there are at least 5 that are really stuck in my head.  Ironically the one I like the least is the single.  I'm still utterly shocked to write this, but it is honestly the favorite album I've purchased in several years.
B00009YOQW|4.0|I bought this drum to have on hand when my two grandsons came to visit, both 17 months old at the time.  I liked the simple, natural look and feel, and really liked the mellow, pleasant sound when the drum was struck.  Depending on where you strike the drum you get one of three different tones.  A down side is that you have to strike it in the center section to get the tones; if you strike the drum less than about 1.5 inches from the outer edge, you get a flat, dull sound.  It's still \\"play-withable\\" of course, but the sound isn't as nice.  One grandchild immediately was entranced and spent a lot of time with the drum, particularly after he figured out he could get different tones.  The other grandchild was totally unimpressed and would throw away the drumstick when I tried to get him interested.  After a couple days, though, he began to play with it too - maybe through watching first grandchild.  Based on this limited experience, my affinity for simple wood toys, and a belief that they would enjoy it more in conjunction with singing or other musical instruments being played, I gave the drum four stars.
B0086QS7N2|5.0|They've really outdone themselves on this album. They're playing harder than they've ever played and the arrangements are outstanding. Neil is absolutely destroying his drums.<br /><br />I personally want to thank producer Nick Raskulinecz for working with these guys and pushing them to play to their full potential....the results speak for themselves.<br /><br />BTW, I loved BU2B but the album version is even better than the original. The title track is mind blowing and it amazes me how these guys can keep progressing and coming up with such great music.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Highly addicting! Used to love this on my Pc so I was excited to have it for my kindle. I would reccommend.
1936891026|3.0|I have read many a Steven Pressfield novel and love and appreciate his prose. This book was no different in my respect for him, a glance into the world of the artist and the daily weight we find pressing upon our shoulders - that which Pressfield dubs Resistance.<br /><br />Essentially the books tells us this: We are artists > something is keeping us from producing our art > label it Resistance > we must overcome Resistance > success will follow.<br /><br />The book is a good read if you're looking for one-liners to inspire you, but I don't see much distinct advantage to reading it, honestly. It's redundant, but I think that's intentional.<br /><br />If you're in a slump and need a pick-me-up, this is the book for you. Otherwise, keep truckin.<br /><br />\\"The counterfeit innovator is wildly self-confident. The real one is scared to death.\\"

0307279189|5.0|Fifty years from now, my hope is that Christopher McDougall will be looked upon as a prophet of a new era in running, a harbinger of (mostly) pain-free exercise and recreation, and the sole reason for every physical therapist's 50% decline in revenue.<br /><br />McDougall propels this novel forward mercilessly with a storyline full of off-the-wall, but very real, characters. And in the meantime, while the storyline carries you, he introduces the idea that our concept of running for the past 50 years has been fundamentally flawed by brand-name shoe companies looking to make a buck as they fund studies that show what we need to prevent running injuries and to help us run faster is a shoe with more padding and more stabilizing factors. The opposite, McDougall proposes, is in fact true.<br /><br />The new research he introduces from leaders in the field of what is now dubbed \\"minimalist running\\" is simply amazing. It shed new light on running for me and forever changed the way I pound the pavement - because I no longer literally pound the pavement. Now, when I run with a forefoot strike - preferably barefoot - I feel like I'm flying.<br /><br />The book's a page-turner, hands down, full of wonderful story and revealing facts that will hopefully change the face of the running world forever.<br /><br />This is also a good gateway book to other sources on minimalist and natural running, like Pete Larson's Runblogger and Danny Abshire of Newton Running.<br /><br />Read strong, carry on!
B001RIY4WE|5.0|What a blu-ray experience! the skynet touch to the menu is really awesome. it uses the internet to show your coordinates along with temperature and more. it appears that skynet has tracked you down and you are waiting for what happens next. the movie is great, sounds great and looks superb
1439156816|3.0|Stephen King is, beyond a doubt, one of the most original writers in the history of the craft. I doubt many other writers have bragging rights to 50 published novels. This book on writing seemed to me kind of a culmination of his craft.<br /><br />The first 100 pages is King saying, \\"Let me tell MY story now.\\" And, never having known anything about King's life, I was absolutely fascinated. It always amazes me the things about one's own life that stick out in people's minds as they grow older. King's anecdotes about his childhood, maturation, meeting his wife, starting a life together and having kids are simply irreplaceable. Everything he writes I can picture so vividly. King is brutally honest with us about his own trials and tribulations, including his extremely personal battle with drug addiction, and will propel you through the first 100 pages faster than you would read through the first 100 of \\"50 Shades of Grey.\\" Not that I've read that...<br /><br />The rest of the book gets down to the nitty gritty of writing and is very matter-of-fact, to-the-point advice. What I like about it is that he doesn't offer anything groundbreaking. Meaning that he simply reaffirms what burgeoning writers are getting to know for themselves. He reaffirms what we read in other writing books, like ones by Zinnser and Roy Peter Clark and Strunk & White.<br /><br />It's nothing groundbreaking, so it's an easy book to put down after the first 100, but every word on every page is sure as hell worth your time.
B007SGM084|5.0|I was not so sure if i was going to like these books that my amazing friend sent me?

B0063GORYU|5.0|Playing this app on my kindle is even more fun than playing it on my laptop because of the ease of the undo button and the ease of moving stacks of cards.
B007C4ZJ0S|1.0|I watched this movie yesterday and I want my $2 rental fee back! :/ The plot is extremely thin, the acting, especially of the lead actress, is awful, and towards the end the heroine's dad makes a mistake that should have been obvious to the bad guy but apparently nobody notices it. The lead actress runs around hiding in a very identifiable hat and has next to no morals...that's probably the only realistic part of the movie.
1401235417|4.0|Written by Scott Snyder, whom to be honest I was not familiar with and art by Greg Capullo (probably best known for his work alongside Todd McFarlane in Spawn), 'The court of owls' is volume one in a series that tells the story of an ancient organization living in Gotham city from the times of its creation. An urban legend until now.<br /><br />This volume covers the editions originally published in their single form from Batman 1-7; it is important to note that there is a subplot involving Nightwing and an assassin named Saiko that is not included here, overall, the story is not affected by this omission but it does create a plot hole near the end (involving Harper Row and Batman)<br /><br />As described above, the story brings a new group known as the court of owls to Batman's attention, without giving away any spoilers, it is up to Batman to find out if the court is real or not. The story is intriguing I will admit that and by the end of the volume you will want to read 'Night of the owls' for the conclusion.<br /><br />As with any new take on Batman when new writers and artists are brought on board, we have a shocking brief introduction that allows artists Greg Capullo to draw some of the most representative villains in Batman's gallery, it is quite interesting to see the designs Capullo made, and his Joker is specially creepy with glimpses of Heath Ledger's rendition of the character in the Nolan films. The design of Gotham is magnificent, reminiscent of the design from Spawn but quite fitting for the story being told.<br /><br />The presentation is fantastic for the hardcover edition, I wish more comic compilations were released like this. The only complaint I have is that at one point near the end of the story four pages are inverted, since **spoiler** it is a hallucination sequence I am not sure if that was on purpose or a happy coincidence **spoiler** At the end of the volume some pinups are included as well as some rough sketches by artist Greg Capullo on the villains that appear in the first number of the series.<br /><br />While not at the level of older series by Jeph Loeb for example ('Madness', 'The Long Halloween', 'Dark Victory') the story presented here does justice to the characters and manages to introduce new villains in a believable manner, they even added some back story to the court of owls related to Bruce's childhood. The importance of the story being told in this volume is that it will have repercussions in the Nightwing series.<br /><br />As a fan of the Batman comics for years I can highly recommend this, I think Snyder does a great job telling his story while at the same time  introducing new myths to the Batman legend without forcing them. Artist Greg Capullo brings a lot to the story with his renditions of the Batman family and villains, a quite enjoyable vision that surprised me as Jim Lee once did with 'Hush'.<br /><br />***EDIT 06/18***<br />After some Google searches and discussing with other people in the Amazon discussions groups I confirmed the upside down pages are intended to be that way, like I said in my review, the story being told suggests it may be like that but I had no confirmation until now. Amazon retired the product for a while as people was reporting this as a problem, well, order with confidence, it is supposed to be like that.the villains that appear in the first number of the series.<br /><br />While not at the level of older series by Jeph Loeb for example ('Madness', 'The Long Halloween', 'Dark Victory') the story presented here does justice to the characters and manages to introduce new villains in a believable manner, they even added some back story to the court of owls related to Bruce's childhood.

0887431461|5.0|This book is perfect for my Kinder.  He loves it and it is really a good preparation for school for him. We are using it for our 'summer school' at home to help prep him for entering Kindergarten. The activities are great and colorful, and he likes to sit and do them.
B00008G7UF|5.0|I just love this movie! Hilarious! Kevin Kline and Meg Ryan play well off one another! What a good price too!
0345803485|1.0|Meymoon's review is spot on. I didn't want to give this book a star at all, but I settled for \\"I hate it\\". There is nothing redeeming about it. The sex is not only unbelievable, it's nauseating. Because I spent good money on it, I read this book to chapter 16. The writing is horrible, but when the sexual violence began, I decided to be done.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I can't get through the day without it!  It is so wonderful to have the Bible at my fingertips throughout the day. even at work! !
B00846REIS|3.0|...that is not saying much. Sylvia Day is definitely a better writer, and for that I am most appreciative. What also made Bared to You bearable was the coming together of Eva and Gideon. The sex, when they had it, was good--well developed scenes that varied. Where the book lost me was with Gideon himself. For a dominant male, at least one I enjoy reading about, he was too wishy-washy for me. I found the incessant back-and-forth, the misfires and misunderstandings between the two, both tiresome and frustrating. As appealing as I'm sure Gideon is/was, the relationship just seemed too hard to endure. I failed to see the upside.<br /><br />The first person POV worked fine here, but might have worked better in the third person. Having Gideon's actions and words come from Eva's POV only may have contributed to my feeling that Gideon was not the fully fleshed out character he could have been. That we never learned what made the man tick was frustrating as well. The whole relationship felt like pulling teeth.

B007SGM084|2.0|I remember growing up with Mills & Boon romance stories.  And I would consider this the adult Mills & Boon version.  There's some shock value, for sure.  At least, for me.  And educational, too.  I mean, I don't even know half of the sex toys mentioned. Are they for real?  Anyway, If you want chick lit with all the possible combination of sex toys with their bells and whistles, then I guess you would like this.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I'm a huge sudoku fan and while the two genres are completely unrelated, if you like one its hard to imagine not liking the other. The game looks great and plays smooth. It kind of eats more battery than I'd like, but that seems like a small complaint given how often I find myself playing it these days.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|Does the book showcase behavior I don't necessarily condone? Absolutely. Fighting. Under age drinking and gambling.<br /><br />Yes, the characters (Abby and Travis) are dysfunctional to say the least. They're hot tempered, irrational, impulsive and insecure. But I could not put this book down. And even though their actions disgusted me at times, my heart cheered them on.<br /><br />Its everything to the extreme. Love. Partying. Heartache. Horrible family back-stories. The book was an addictive rollercoaster of emotions.<br /><br />Would I want my daughter to marry a guy like Travis? Hell no. But I still enjoyed the intensity of the romance, the absolute passion. I read a lot of stories that I wouldn't \\"try at home\\" - but that doesn't mean they aren't thrilling, heart-pounding books.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|It is a very good movie which shows the caste as their younger selves in a very realistic and entertaining manner.  VERY ENJOYABLE!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I LOVED book 1, this one is just as well written and just as interesting for the most part.  The sex scenes are awesome, but I must say I was disappointed in the direction the story went near the end of the book.  I read this series for the fantasy, and that bubble burst at the major turning point in the plot.  No spoilers, you will have to read it yourself.  Worth the read, but be warned!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this Bible ap.  The Bible is very User friendly.  It is very easy to go from the different books of the Bible and/or change verses.  I carry my kindle fire most everywhere I go, so I also have my Bible.  I am finding I am able to read more.  I would recommend this to anyone.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was the most enjoyable book I have read in a long time.  It is fantasy, pure and simple, and that is one of the reasons why I read.  It is well written, the reader cares about what happens to the characters from the beginning, and the sex scenes are fabulous (not to mention, educational, haha.)  I absolutely love this book.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Excellent Book, couldn't put it down.<br />Certainly had my attention on the first page... and you will need to have book 2 on hand when done with 1. The author certainly had this planned well.
B004IJZFP4|1.0|I love the original, and have it on vinyl - but I haven't listened to it since my turntable died more than a decade ago.  I saw this and thought deluxe meant improved (but I must admit - how could you improve one of the best LPs ever?) - this however is GARBAGE.  The original is so much better.  This sounds like a bunch of demos with some added riffs thrown in that they found scattered here and there - just AWFUL!  I'm glad I only wasted $5 on the MP3 download - never to be listened to again.
B0000024K1|5.0|If you want evidence that rap could be art, check this out.<br /><br />At a time when Run-DMC, Beastie Boys and LL Cool J were bringing rap to the masses, the illustrious team of Chuck D, Flavor Flav, Professor Griff and disc jockey Terminator X created an album that was a watershed in the history of rap. Released in 1988, IT TAKES A NATION OF MILLIONS TO HOLD US BACK was a much-needed tonic to anyone sickened by the pedestrian pop, fluff hair metal and posers that sang about partying, good times and scantily clad women. That very few artists have come close to creating such a highly experimental, innovative and exhilarating rap album is a testament at how great Public Enemy were at their prime.<br /><br />So what can be said about MILLIONS that hasn't been mentioned by other reviewers that gave it five-stars? It remains a fresh, vibrant album even to this day. What Public Enemy and their producers Bomb Squad did here was they took the rap formula pioneered by Run-DMC and Eric B. & Rakim and, with a combination of Chuck D's politically charged yet intelligently written lyrics and the elements of free jazz, hard funk, distorted feedback, musical concrete and even avant-garde, created a rap album that was musically and politically revolutionary. MILLIONS is part party album, part rallying call: a political record that anyone could dance or bang their heads to.<br /><br />Unlike some of the best rap records out there, there is no crap in sight; not a single filler track to be seen. Every song is either a classic or a strong album track. But taken together, they form a hugely invigorating record. MILLIONS can (and should be) listened to from beginning to end, as overlooking a song means you're missing something important. Even its brief interludes have merit and offer a much-needed respite from the intense full-fledged songs.<br /><br />\\"Countdown to Armageddon\\", with its blaring siren, sets the tone for the album. After that, two of Public Enemy's best-known songs follow: the jamming \\"Bring the Noise\\", which was covered by Anthrax, and \\"Don't Believe the Hype\\", which debunks the general conception that people preaching messages are racists, criminals and hooligans. After that, the band runs riot and, with help by the Bomb Squad, infuse each song with distorted feedback, loud horns, savage guitar and unrecognizable samples, from the hard guitar shrieking and disc scratches of \\"Terminator X to the Edge of Panic\\" to the sultry funk of \\"Caught, Can We Get a Witness?\\" and in-your-face anthem \\"Rebel Without a Pause\\", one of their best-loved songs. On the concluding track, \\"Party for Your Right to Fight\\", they turn the Beastie Boys' \\"Fight for Your Right to Party\\" inside out and create a party track of their own.<br /><br />Besides being a triumph of production, MILLIONS has amazing songwriting and rapping, courtesy of Chuck D and Flavor Flav. Chuck D has one of the most powerful voices of all time and Flavor Flav adds the comic relief that is genuinely witty. Here, those two are on top of their game, rather they're accusing the FBI of phone tapping (\\"Louder Than the Bomb\\"), comparing crack addicts to zombies (\\"Night of the Living Baseheads\\"), exclaiming how TV turns the public into a mass of morons (\\"She Watches Channel Zero?\\") or equating the prison system to slavery (\\"Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos\\"). Every song here is perfectly written, perfectly sang and perfectly produced. In short, perfect.<br /><br />Anyone who dismisses rap as a misogynistic, overly derivative form of music should listen to this album and eat their words. It's true that some of today's rappers fall under the categories that these critics peg rap as: violent, derivative and creatively bankrupt. But then you have rappers that are honest, provocative, highly original and musically rich, rappers like Ice Cube, Ice-T, Boogie Down Productions, Eric B & Rakim, Beastie Boys, Run-DMC and, of course, Public Enemy. The music they left behind is eternal proof that thereis more to rap than b----es and money. Rap could be also a protest, a rallying call and an artistic expression. No other album crystallizes that attitude more than IT TAKES A NATIONS OF MILLIONS TO HOLD US BACK, which forever rewrote hip-hop music. Not only is it the greatest rap album ever made but one of the greatest albums in rock n' roll history.<br /><br />Strongest recommendation to buy at all costs.is more to rap than b----es and money.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I heard the hype so I had to see what this book was about.  I've read erotica before but I'm thinking, who wrote this?  A 15 year old?  The writing style is on par of what I've read from young adult novels...not that I read a lot of them but I read the Twilight Saga before it became popular.  Now I'm reading posts saying that this author liked the Twilight books and I guess she got the inspiration to have the story set in Washington.  Is she British?  I read a lot of books that I buy from the UK so I am familiar with the writing style.  People in America do not say things such as, \\"I wonder how she's getting on with Elliot?\\" or \\"I need to ring her up\\".  Ana is like Bella in Twilight, only more annoying if such a thing is possible.  Her use of the word, \\"Holy\\" is annoying, even more so when she says, \\"Oh my\\".  Every page, she uses the words/phrases, \\"I'm turning crimson\\", \\"I'm turning scarlet\\", \\"biting my lip\\".  Did the author get bored and didn't know what else to write?  I am only on Chapter 9 and the reason I keep reading is because I downloaded it and feel obligated to finish it.  I haven't even gotten to the \\"Red Room of Pain\\".  Will I be shocked?  Doubtful if it's anything from what I've read up to this point.  I've read Anne Rice erotica and other erotica novels but I don't get why this book has become so popular.  I asked my coworker if this was a teen book and she laughed.  Apparently she thinks it's the greatest novel ever, and she is 56 so she doesn't read books unless her teen girls give them to her.
B007SUW24W|4.0|I happened to see Ed Sheeran performing on TV at the Brits Awards (where he won several awards, if I recall) in February, and really liked what I saw. I finally picked up the album the other day when I saw him live here in Cincinnati (more on that later). Sheeran had released a number of singles with great acclaim in the UK before this album came out last Fall in the UK.<br /><br />\\"+\\" (13 tracks; 50 min.) brings Ed Sheeran's best output from those multiple pre-album singles, and a number of new tracks. When the opening track \\"The A Team\\" comes on, the immediate reaction is that this reminds me of \\"Damien Rice meets James Blake\\", and indeed a number of tracks on here are in that very same vein. But on a number of other tracks, Sheeran expands into further territory, even rapping (\\"Grade B\\" and \\"Lego House\\" among others). Other highlights include the UK singles \\"You Need Me, I Don't Need You\\" (with more rapping) and the last official track on here, the epic \\"Give Me Love\\" (it is followed by an uncredited track to close things out). This is an enjoyable debut album for sure.<br /><br />At the Cincinnati show, Sheeran put on a blazing 35 min. solo-act (opening for Snow Patrol), where he worked with loops and creating a one-man band wall of sound, just incredible. He started with an amazing 10 min. version of \\"Give Me Love\\", inciting a crowd sing-along (mind you, this is the FIRST song of his set!), and doing it again on \\"You Need Me, I Don't Need You\\", just wow. If you have a chance to catch Ed Sheeran on tour, do not miss it! Meanwhile \\"+\\" is a promising debut album, sure to end up on my year-end list of the \\"best of\\" this year's albums.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this game period. I have nothing else to say other than you never get tired of it. Once I start a game I cant stop.
B007FOH7UU|4.0|Trying to find their way for years after starting out so successfully, culminating in the 2010's let's call it bizzare \\"Night Train\\" release, Keane finally realized that they've been drifting way too far from the sound that everyone loved on \\"Hopes and Fears\\" and \\"Under the Iron Sea\\", and so now comes the band's (now officially a foursome) new album.<br /><br />\\"Strangeland\\" (12 tracks; 46 min.) kicks off with \\"You Are Young\\", which immediately puts us back to more familiar sounds of Keane (although I couldn't help but think of how the similarly-titled Fun,'s \\"We Are Young\\" is now ruling the airwaves). Good tracks follow one after another, confirming that this indeed the \\"classic\\" Keane we've been missing for too long. Check out also the great \\"Silenced By the Night\\" and \\"Watch How You Go\\". Side 1 culminates in the romping \\"On the Road\\", the best track on the album for me. I rate the first half 4.5 stars. The second half of the album starts off with the pensive \\"The Starting Line\\", and the remaining of the second half is not bad, but it unfortunately lacks the element of any surprise, although I also like \\"Day Will Come\\" quite a bit. I rate the second half of the album 3.5 stars.<br /><br />But overall, this album is MILES better than what we have heard from Keane in the last 4-5 years or so. Welcome back, guys! I've seen Keane in concert a number of times in the heighdays of 2005-2006, but not since (their US concert touring dropped of significantly after that). Can't wait to see these guys again, in particular now that they are a foursome and presumably a \\"fuller\\" sound in concert. Meanwhile, \\"Strangeland\\" is a welcome back to the classic sound of Keane we know and love.
B0086QS7N2|4.0|Back in the nineties I was ready to write Rush off.  After \\"Counterparts\\" and \\"Test For Echo\\" not to mention 2002's \\"Vapor Trails\\" and 2004's \\"Feedback\\" EP, I figured  Rush was still a great live ticket but had run its creative course.  Then in 2007 the band released \\"Snakes & Arrows\\".  It wasn't perfect but it was a lot better than anything they had releases since their glory days of the 70's and 80's.  Part of me feared that record would be the band's last hurrah.  I am thankful to say that \\"Clockwork Angels\\" is a wonderful,  but not perfect CD.  Here's a quick breakdown.<br /><br />Classic Rush songs - \\"Caravan\\", \\"BU2B\\", \\"The Anarchist\\", \\"Halo Effect\\", \\"Seven Cities of Gold\\", \\"Headlong Flight\\", and \\"The Garden\\".  All of the songs mentioned are among some of the best material the band has released.  Usually it takes me a few listens to get into new Rush material, however, I fell in love with both \\"Caravan\\" and \\"BU2B\\" on first listen when they were released back in 2010.  \\"The Anarchist\\" has one of the best Rush rifts in years that measures up to other classic Rush rifts as \\"Freewill\\" and \\"Limelight\\". \\" Both \\"Headlong Flight\\" and \\"Seven Cities of Gold\\" start off with great bass riffs that seem to be inspired by Les Claypool of Primus.  Both songs end up being incredible rockers. Finally, \\"Halo Effect\\" and \\"The Garden\\" are two of the strongest ballads the band has ever recorded.<br /><br />Good songs - I liked the song \\"Clockwork Angels\\" until I got to the chorus.  That chorus sounds as if they came up with the title and wrote the song around it.  Not a bad song but not great either.  \\"Wreckers\\" has a good melody, but doesn't compare with some of the other songs either.  Musically, \\"Carnies\\" is a great song.  However, lyrically it's just okay.  Here is a sample, \\"A face of naked evil  / Turns the young boy's blood to ice  /Deadly confrontation  / Such a dangerous device.\\".<br /><br />Forgettable songs - \\"Wish Them Well\\" just doesn't work.  Weak chorus, weak lyrics.This is the album's weak spot.  Also, \\"BU2B2\\" is okay but really doesn't add to the overall composition of the album.<br /><br />At the rate of an album every five years this might be the last new Rush to be heard until 2017, if ever.  If this is the last Rush album, at least the band went out with a really good effort.<br /><br />Peace
B0039208QM|5.0|I recently acquired Batman Returns on Blu-Ray, having not seen the film in a very long time, but always remembering that I liked it better than the original Batman (1989).  The first thing that stands out about this movie is how visually stunning it is, and this is all done, for the most part, with sets, miniatures, costumes, and lighting, without relying on the crutch of CGI.  Regarding costumes, Keaton's Batman, in particular, looks much sleeker and elegant in this one, compared to the original, and Michele Pfeiffer's Catwoman absolutely lights up the screen in skin-tight shiny black.  Of course, Danny Devito's Penguin is made up to be absolutely repulsive and pitiful, but it is, in my opinion, an effective portrayal of Penguin as a horrible little monster.  Bo Welch's production design and the cinematography is very sleek and sharp looking, and, although still dark in its hue, the picture is much more crystalline and less murky than the original.  In 1080p Hi-Def, Batman Returns looks superb.  While the plot is not the most brilliant thing ever written, it is a good story, with lots of sharp dialogue that underscores the sadness beneath the characters.  In addition, the finale of the movie is much more dramatic and more satisfying than that of the original.  Also, the film, overall, has a much looser feel than the original, which I always thought was a little too stiff in its presentation.  Watching the film, after not seeing it for so long, makes me wish that Tim Burton and Michael Keaton had teamed up for a 3rd installment, but alas, the franchise was derailed by the neon-cheese of the people who took over.  Recalling 1992, and the bad reactions that this movie elicited, I remember actually being proud of how much some people disliked it.  Seeing it again, I regard Batman Returns as a classic, that has gotten better with time, much more so than the first Batman.  In addition to the superb visuals of this Blu-Ray, the commentary track by Burton is enjoyable, andthe special features are loaded with lots of good stuff.  I highly recommend Batman Returns as one of the best Blu-Rays to own !!
B0067RQYNW|5.0|I've seen quite a bunch of negative reviews for this app, but out of total honesty, I have to say it is the best office document editing application I've tried so far. (including some paid-for ones)<br />If we expect a full-featured office app for android, we may never see it. MS Office is a monster, while the first thing a mobile app has to be is small enough. Now, if we expect a small app that can do the job and do it right, then we have this app.<br />Kingsoft's Office is a great app, rich in basic features which will allow you to edit word, text, and log documents as well as spreadsheets easily and properly.<br />You can save your documents and share them via email for further review or more advance design or editing, allowing you to work with your documents back and forth across yor devices.<br />Kingsoft Office is fully compatible with MS Office, even the 2010 edition.<br />I seriously recommend this application, you can always download the latest version from their website.<br />Awesome little app, at the best price. FREE!
0525478817|5.0|I bought this book for my 16 year old daughter after reading a review in a magazine. She loved the book so I thought I would read it as well.  Read it in one day.  Couldn't put it down.  I loved the characters!
B007K3JFUQ|1.0|Loved the movie, couldn't wait for it to be released on Blu-Ray.  Did however make the mistake of purchasing the Blu-Ray combo pack, you think I would have learned after experiencing previous digital copy issues.  This whole digital copy scam has pushed me over the edge regarding spending anymore of my hard earned money on this crap.  What happened to the good old days when you could download a copy of a movie to ITunes or your computer, now you spend more money and have to contend with the studios and their numerous partners?  With this combo pack I was forced into setting up yet another account, this time with Flixster, and had to go through the process TWICE to then wind up with NOTHING.  I can't use the digital copy on my IPad, IPhone, Kindle Fire or laptop so I'm stuck with having to either view on my desktop or use the DVD copy to view on my laptop, not exactly what I would call a Digital Copy.<br /><br />Maybe I'm missing something but buying a digital copy should mean I can use it on any of my compatible devices.  Ultra-Violet is nothing more than a file cabinet which stores your \\"digital copies\\" but then you have to sign into another partner account (i.e., Sony, Universal, Warner Bros., Flixster) to view the movie only on your desktop.  So now I have to log into my Ultra-Violet account then get redirected to another site with a different login and then still can't download to my devices.  If that's not a scam I'm not sure what is!!!!  Some of the \\"partners\\" do allow ITunes copies but each partner is different so you aren't guaranteed you will be able to use the digital copy on any Apple products (IPad, IPhone) or an Android/Kindle Fire device. Flixster supposedly allows download to Apple and Android devices but after numerous attempts I was unable to download this movie to either my IPad or Kindle Fire.<br /><br />Also of note if you do purchase any of these Digital Copies they all have EXPIRATION DATES on them, some expire within three months of when the disc is released; I already got burnt by not noticing the expiration date on a movie.<br /><br />While I am against piracy I can certainly understand why people are driven to it; the studios are forcing people to go with illegal copies of current films because they are making it so difficult to download and use these digital copies.  They are penalizing customers who are making legal purchases!<br /><br />Also what's with Amazon, I purchase all these Blu-Ray combo packs and only one of them was available through my Amazon Instant Video Library, why when I purchase a combo pack from Amazon are those movies not immediately available in my Video Library list or worse why do I have to pay even more to get an Amazon digital copy?<br /><br />Bottom Line: These Ultra-Violet/Digital Copy movies don't work so I may be old fashioned but unless it's some extraordinary movie I'll go back to buying plain old DVD's, it'll allow me to watch on my TV, computer and laptop, which is all I'm able to do with most of these combo packs AND it'll save me money and a lot of aggravation!!!!!!<br /><br />NOTED ADDED: Seems that the specials on this Blu-Ray Combo pack on nonexistant and the ones that are included you need to download a free IPad App and you also need to have a Facebook Account to use.  Again I guess we're just old fashion but not everyone in the world uses Facebook or has an IPad so that leaves you with nothing - thanks for that Warner Brothers.
B000VSYDRM|1.0|I chose this film based on its 4 star rating. \\"Big mistake, huge.\\" It is slow, disturbing and frustrating. I had endured this film thinking it had to get better, that there would be some point or some reason for the story.  Distressingly, there was none, ever. This is just another case of making a movie because one can be made. I'm surprised that such a high quality cast would produce such a lousy film, but it wouldn't be the first time.  In addition to the pointlessness of the story/plot, it moved so slow. I fast forwarded through many scenes and didn't miss anything. My suggestion is if you're going to waste your time w/a movie or are sick in bed, there are many better movies (I'm sure) to occupy your time.

0345505387|2.0|Like most people, I fell in love with the Outlander series.  Gabaldon is a wonderful novelist.  Her descriptions, dialogue, and ability to create characters we are so invested in, is an amazing talent.<br /><br />However, I am also a big fan of graphic novels.  Neil Gaiman's Sandman series, Brian Vaughn's Y: The Last Man, and Bill Willingham's Fables series are a few of my favorites.  In this highly visual medium, Diana Gabaldon falls far short of the mark.<br /><br />One of the first rules of writing is show, don't tell.  What better chance to show how a character is feeling, through illustration, rather than thought bubble after thought bubble of exposition?<br /><br />The idea that the story is from Murtagh's perspective is false; that lasts only the first few pages.  Likewise, it is not really told from Jamie's perspective.  It seems to take for granted that the reader will have read Outlander, and is coming to the story already knowing the characters, what's going to happen, etc.<br /><br />I don't know if, due to her past experience writing Disney comics, Diana Gabaldon figured a graphic novel would work essentially the same way, or perhaps because she is so invested in these characters and \\"getting them to look right,\\" that she was unable to effectively collaborate with her illustrator, or something else entirely, but this book fell far short of the high standard the Outlander series sets.<br /><br />If there are any future graphic novels, I will not be buying them.

B001DJ7PMI|5.0|With the 50th anniversary of JFK's murder on the horizon, we anticipate being samped with a radh of \\"new\\" books with \\"old\\" information spun just a bit differently. But for the cost of most of these \\"new\\" books, one can still buy the blockbuster movie that started it all: [[ASIN:B001DJ7PMI JFK: Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition)]].<br /><br />I already have an old print of JFK, but have always wanted to get a copy of the Director's Cut, if only for the Bonus features on the second disk. I missed this on it's initial release, and was gratified that it is still available on Amazon, and it was no disappointment. On recently rewatching the Bonus disc, I was amazed at the amount of information presented in the deleted scenes and \\"extra\\" scenes rescued from the \\"cutting room floor\\". There is well over an hour of this material and I felt as if were watching the movie for the first time.<br /><br />I highly recommend this edition as well for the interesting commentary of Oliver Stone as he explains the choices that he had to make concerning which material to include and which was problematic. Be suire to listen to the commentary, especially if you are well versed in the facts surrounding the case.

B000AY74OG|5.0|\\"Sugar Honey Ice Tea!\\"<br />A Review of Madagascar<br />Jennie Stapay<br /><br />The movie \\"Madagascar\\" has no, if any historical context, other than the fact that groups, like PETA, protest animals being kept in zoos. There are two directors for this movie: Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath. Darnell is known for directing all three movies of the Madagascar series (so far): \\"Madagascar,\\" \\"Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa,\\" and \\"Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted.\\" McGarth, as well as directing \\"Madagascar\\" and \\"Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa,\\" also directed the movie \\"Megamind.\\" The studio that produced this movie is DreamWorks Animation, producers of the \\"Shrek\\" series and \\"Shark Tale,\\" as well as \\"How to Train Your Dragon.\\"<br /> The main characters in this movie are Alex the lion, Marty the zebra, Melman the giraffe, and Gloria the hippo. The setting is the Central Park Zoo, Grand Central Station, a boat, and Madagascar. The main characters mistake Madagascar for the San Diego Zoo at first, because Melman proposes that the \\"rocks are real,\\" which means they just got moved to a different zoo. The quirky quartet gets to Madagascar by following Marty.  Alex and a large group, including Melman, Gloria and a bunch of monkeys chase after Marty, ending up at Central park Station. All four are discovered there and are tranquilized, and an animal rights group wants to put them back in the wild, \\"where they belong.\\" The movie follows the adventures of the group on their journey.<br /> At the Central Park Zoo, Marty the zebra is celebrating his tenth birthday, but longs to see the rest of the world, not just the zoo, believing that he can find wide-open spaces to run around in, like Connecticut. Marty wants an adventure, needs an adventure, will have an adventure. Marty's best friend is Alex the lion, who attempts to cheer up his friend by singing Frank Sinatra's \\"New York, New York\\" with him. Still unsatisfied, Marty gets some tips from the zoo's penguins; Skipper, Kowalski, Rico and Private. Skipper is the head of the penguins; the penguins are not the head of Skipper. Similarly, the penguins, intelligent and sneaky, are also trying to escape the zoo. Marty's friends - Alex the lion, Melman the giraffe and Gloria the hippopotamus - realize Marty's folly and follow him. The four, along with the penguins and the chimpanzees, Mason and his silent friend Phil, eventually find themselves at Grand Central Station. They are quickly sedated by tranquilizer darts when Alex's attempt to communicate with humans is mistaken for aggression. The zoo (under pressure from animal-rights activists) is forced to ship the animals, by sea, to a Kenyan wildlife preserve. During their travels, the penguins escape from their enclosure and take over the ship, intent on taking it to Antarctica. Their craziness antics on the bridge cause the crates containing Alex, Marty, Melmen, and Gloria to fall off the boat and wash ashore on Madagascar, because of the rocking of the ship. The animals are soon able to regroup, initially believing themselves to be in San Diego, California. Upon exploring, however, they come across a pack of lemurs led by King Julien XIII, and quickly learn of their true location. Angry Frustrated Alex blames Marty for their predicament and attempts to signal for help to get back to civilization. Marty, on the other hand, finds the wild to be exactly what he was looking for, with Gloria and Melman soon joining him in enjoying the island. Alex eventually comes around, though his hunting instincts begin to show; he has been away from the pampered zoo life of prepacked steaks for too long. He's no predator! The group is accepted by the lemurs, though King Julien's advisor, Maurice, cautions them about Alex's predatory nature. He cautions them to be wary; to be careful; to be cautious when dealing with Alex. King Julien ignores Maurice's concerns and persuades the group to help the lemurs fend off the fossa, who hunt the lemurs as prey. Neither bad weather,nor strangers, nor fossa keeps the lemurs from liking to move it. While initially Alex scares frightens the fossa away and is worshiped by the lemurs, he later falls under his instincts and attacks Marty. Realizing that Alex is now a threat to them, King Julien banishes Alex to the far side of the island, where the fossas live. Shocked, Marty begins to regret his decision to leave the zoo, seeing what Alex has turned into. The penguins, having been to Antarctica and found that it sucks, land the boat on Madagascar. Seeing this as a chance to return Alex to New York, Marty rushes after his friend against the wishes of the others. Marty attempts to convince the now grizzled, starving Alex to return by using the \\"New York\\" song but Alex refuses in fear of attacking him again. The penguins, Gloria and Melman go to find Marty, but are trapped by the fossa. By the last minute, Alex finally overcomes his predatory nature and scares the fossa away from the lemur territory forever. The lemurs regain their respect for Alex and the penguins help him satisfy his hunger through sushi instead of steak. As the lemurs throw a bon voyage celebration for the foursome, the penguins decide not to break the news that the ship has run out of fuel and that they are still stuck on the island, setting the stage for Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa. This is the end.<br /> The theme of Madagascar is friendship and overcoming personal wants for the greater good. In the scene where Alex the lion overcomes his wanting to eat Marty, the zebra, he's demonstrating the theme of this movie. The other theme, friendship, is demonstrated by the quirky quartet when they stay together through the troubles that occur in Madagascar, as well as overcoming the fact that everyone has flaws.<br /> The director's and producer's purpose for making this film was giving the public entertainment. Another purpose is that it shows kids self-sacrifice. The theme can apply to your life, so if you're on \\"bath salts\\" and youwant to eat your friend, you won't because you watched this movie and realized that eating your friend is selfish and not for the greater good.<br /> This movie was good--it had good morals, but crude humor. There are parts that refer to things of a sexual and crude nature, but that just flies over little kids' heads. If you do find that your child can make the connection between the phrase \\"Hoover dam\\" (with an emphasis on the \\"dam\\") and the word \\"damn\\" (used in a curse-like manner), you might want to have a long talk with them. Also, there is a scene where one of the characters spells out \\"HELP,\\" but the round part of the \\"P\\" falls so that it spells, \\"HELL.\\" I recommend this movie to watch with your family, or if you're alone and want something childish to watch.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book was completely outstanding. Although it was very close to Fifty Shades of Grey, I still couldt not help but fall in love with Gideon. The passion between Gideon and Eva was remarkable, and I am counting down the days until the second book is released.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was one of the most exciting books that I have read in a long time.  I do not agree with the bondage or kinky sex, but it was exciting and a great love story.  I am sorry to see this or any book being baned from libraries or other reading places.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I have finished this book days ago, and can't seem to rid my mind of Travis Maddox and his adoring affection and love for Abby. Although their relationship is dysfunctional, the love that Travis shows for Abby is heart warming. I adore the nickname Travis has given to Abby. I hope they make this into a movie, because I believe it would sell millions. In my opinion this book is completely underpriced for $2.99. Keep up the outstanding work Jamie, and I cannot (and i assume lots of other people too) wait until you release Travis's point of view. I can't wait to dive back into his thoughts!

0385738773|2.0|** THIS IS A REVIEW FOR THE AUDIO VERSION OF THE BOOK ***<br /><br />BOOK DESCRIPTION<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT: This review assumes you have read the first two books in this trilogy. If you haven't, then I wouldn't read this review.<br /><br />With the Maze Trials and the Scorch Trials finished, WICKED (personified by The Rat Man) is ready to give Groups A and B their memories back and finish the blueprint for a cure for the Flare. Yet Thomas and his friends (most notably Newt and Minho) are so distrustful of WICKED that they opt to attempt an escape instead. With Teresa and the others ready to get their memories back and trust WICKED, Thomas, Newt and Minho find themselves on their own, accompanied by Brenda and Jorge. As they flee WICKED and head to Denver, more details about this new Flare-infested world begin to reveal themselves, and Thomas has some difficult decisions to make.<br /><br />MY THOUGHTS<br /><br />THE FOLLOWING WAS WRITTEN AFTER I READ THE BOOK BUT BEFORE I FOUND OUT SOME CRITICAL INFORMATION:<br /><br />Shame on you, James Dashner! I was disappointed with how you chose to conclude the series. I kept waiting and waiting for Thomas to get his memory back and tell us everything about his involvement with WICKED and then you copped out! Color me disappointed. Perhaps you weren't too sure yourself and decided to just skip over the nitty-gritty details, but, as a reader, I wanted to know the full back story, and it annoyed me when I didn't get it.<br /><br />About two-thirds of the way through, when I realized that I wasn't going to get what I wanted in this book, I'll admit that I kind of checked out. The format of one close call after another started to annoy me. Ending almost every single chapter with a cliffhanger began to grate on my nerves, and I realized that I didn't care all that much about Thomas or his friends anymore. And when you started dispatching characters left and right, I let them go with nary a tear. In the end, this was a trilogy that started strong and got steadily weaker. Blech.<br /><br />THE FOLLOWING WAS WRITTEN AFTER I FOUND OUT SOME CRITICAL INFORMATION:<br /><br />OK, James Dashner. Now I'm really pissed. At first when I finished your trilogy, I thought you just couldn't come up with the back story about Thomas's relationship with WICKED. You kept teasing us and teasing us but never delivered the goods. Then, Alyce at At Home With Books filled me in on WHY we didn't get the payoff promised throughout the trilogy: You're writing a prequel (The Kill Order) and doing a money grab and stretching out the \\"trilogy\\" with another book! Shame shame shame!! I really feel that you copped out and saw that, once The Maze Runner was a big hit, that you could stretch this all out and get another book out of it. That is why Thomas never chooses to get his memories back, isn't it? Well, I think that sucks. And I won't be buying The Kill Order. I'm done with this series. You owed us the full story and you held it back and gave us a mediocre, unsatisfying third book and I say \\"Boo on that.\\" Harumph.<br /><br />P.S. I don't know if you can see it, but the book cover for The Death Cure says \\"The Final Book of the Maze Runner Trilogy.\\" To which I say, \\"bulls**t!\\"<br /><br />About the Narration: Mark Deakins was the narrator and did an OK job. He did a good job giving various characters different voices (Newt with an Irish accent??) I didn't have any real problems with the narration ... just the book itself.hat started strong and got steadily weaker.

0385737955|4.0|BOOK DESCRIPTION<br /><br />Thomas, a teenager with almost no memory of his past, wakes up on day in a dark elevator that lets him out in a strange world called the Glade. Populated only by other teenage boys, the Glade is a self-sufficient community (with farming and livestock) that is enclosed within gigantic walls that close each night. During the day, the walls open to reveal what seems to be an endless maze, patrolled by deadly creatures called Grievers. Understandably, Thomas is confused and confounded by this new world he finds himself in. As he tries to find out what is happening, he discovers that some of the Gladers have been there for two years, with a new boy arriving each month. But the day after Thomas arrives, something unprecedented happens--a teenage girl who appears to be dead arrives in the elevator clutching a note in her hands that says \\"This is the last one.\\" Soon after her arrival, things begin to change, and the Gladers must fight for their lives and discover the secrets of the maze before it is too late.<br /><br />MY THOUGHTS<br /><br />In some ways, it seems like the terms \\"YA\\" and \\"Dystopia\\" are becoming synonymous. And, even though I often struggle with YA books, I keep finding myself getting sucked into dystopic trilogies. Starting with The Hunger Games and moving to the Chaos Walking trilogy, I can't seem to quit these types of books for some reason. I just find the premises so intriguing, and I have to find out what happens next.<br /><br />This series was no exception. Once again, we have our YA hero up against bizarre challenges that are often deadly. As in The Hunger Games, kids die--often in grotesque and disturbing ways. Unlike The Hunger Games, the kids don't kill each other (mostly), but must work together to survive,  figure out how to escape the maze and discover what is going on in their strange new reality. Dashner does a good job of providing enough \\"clues\\" and hints about what might be going on to keep the reader intrigued, and he keeps the chapters short and moving along. Almost every chapter ends with a mini-cliffhanger.<br /><br />As in most YA books, the language is kept relatively simple and with a focus on the action. To keep things \\"clean\\" for a younger audience, Dashner has the Gladers adopt their own slang in place of curse words, calling each other \\"shuck faces\\" and \\"klunks.\\" For the most part, it seems to work, even though I kept substituting the obvious curse word on my own. (I guess I'm a little jaded).<br /><br />Still, when I reached the end of the first book, I knew I was going to have to continue on with the second book, The Scorch Trials. Apparently, I am a dystopic-loving teen deep in my heart as I can't seem to quit these types of books. (My reviews for the second and third books will be posted over the next two days. If you keep reading them, you can see my opinions about this series deteriorate until I end up basically hating on James Dashner.)d, and he keeps the chapters short and moving along.

0385738765|3.0|BOOK DESCRIPTION<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT: This review assumes that you have read the first book of this series, The Maze Runner. If you haven't read that book yet, I recommend skipping this review.<br /><br />Now that they've escaped the maze, Thomas and the other Gladers are plunged into the \\"real\\" world and another set of trials so that WICKED can gather more data to devise a cure for the Flare. This time, they are given the task of crossing the Scorch (the dried out desert-like hot wasteland of what probably used to be Mexico) within a specific timeframe in order to reach a safe haven. If they make it across the Scorch and survive the Flare-infected Cranks that live there, they are promised a cure and an end to the trials. However, things start off strange when each Glader wakes up with a tattoo on their neck that seems to define their place in the group. In addition, Teresa goes missing and another boy takes her place. As in the first book, all is not what it seems, and Thomas and his friends are thrown into adventure that will require them to stay alive long enough to reach the end.<br /><br />MY THOUGHTS<br /><br />Throughout this book, Dashner starts giving Thomas more of his memories back, and we begin to get a clearer picture of what happened to the world after the sun flares started. But, once again, the focus is squarely on the action, with Thomas, Newt, Minho and the other Gladers facing a new set of challenges, most often in the form of the Cranks, which are people who have been severely affected by the Flare and appear as crazy, sore-infested violent people.<br /><br />The biggest mystery facing Thomas this time is how he is going to deal with the fate of Teresa and deciding whether WICKED is a force for good or bad. Dashner keeps you guessing who is \\"real\\" and who is \\"fake\\" as the book goes along, and I was never quite sure what would befall the Gladers next. The book was a decent follow-up to the first one and moves the action along to get ready for the final book, called The Death Cure.<br /><br />My only quibble is that I'm starting to get as antsy for answers as Thomas and his friends. It felt like one obstacle after another, with Thomas always getting away by the skin of his teeth. This started to feel a little repetitive.the final book, called The Death Cure.<br /><br />My only quibble is that I'm starting to get as antsy for answers as Thomas and his friends.

B004YM6JK0|5.0|Supernatural fans have had it better than most for quite some time. After a rocky first season, Supernatural season 2 set the tone for the rest of the series: a powerful force with personal ties to the Winchesters that has to be dealt with is a formula that has spawned the series most successful seasons. Unfortunately, some fans feel that this blueprint should never change and because of that feel that this season was lacking. I am here to disagree.<br /><br />I have loved every season of Supernatural, but as the seasons passed I started to miss the lighter episodes that showcase why the boys are the best in the business; namely the monster of the week cases. The boys having to overcome personal struggles and stop the apocalypse is fantastic, but sometimes it gets too heavy. Season 7 did a nearly flawless job of combining the two.<br /><br />The constant threat of the Leviathan mencace was handled well without becoming over bearing. Sam and Dean still have to save the world, but also show their versatility as hunters. They take on everything from age old witches and ancient Egyptian dieties, to killer clowns and spirits that can only be seen while drunk. There are also plenty of heavier episodes with them dealing with the nearly unstoppable leviathans, creating a satifsfying balance.<br /><br />Season 2 still ranks as my favorite season, but this set is easily my second favorite. Season 7 is an entertaining, well balnaced season that has something for all fans. There doesn't have to be an apocalypse every season for it to be good, and season 7 proves that.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book grabs you from the beginning and enthralls - a little mystery, a little bondage, a little sex, a little romance, and oh so appealing characters. You can't put it down, which is trouble when you need to get up in the morning.  Christian seems to be a composite of the type of men most women want - thoughtful, aloof, tender, masterful, humorous, sexy, good looking, tall, rather well built, and last but not least - rather wealthy!!  What a combination!  Watching the two of them do the dance for the first book simply sets the bait and reels one in..........oh for the second installment!

B007L3BMGA|5.0|I'm am not a big reader and all through school I would just go online and find reviews and other people's work when I had to read something. With that said, I find it hard to really get captivated by a book but I had all three of these books read in one week on top of maintaining a house, spending time with friends, and working 45+ hours! Given these are her first books she has written, they are not perfect. Which every other customer review has said that. There are a lot of repeated sayings that every other review has covered. I think that is what captured me into reading them non-stop. It was an easy read without all these crazy sayings. I personally fell in love with Ana and her personality. Her character was so real and understandable. Also, the suspense in this book was great. Not really knowing exactly what was going to happen next made this a real page turner! There were several moments where I wouldn't stop reading till I got through the next \\"soap opera\\" scene.<br /><br />I would suggest this book to anyone who is not offended by slightly intense sex scenes and vulgar language. Well worth the time!
0143119680|3.0|I love me a long story in any kind of paranormal/urban fantasy/sci-fi genre. When I saw a new book that had been reviewed by many as the \\"Twilight for grown-ups\\" and \\"Anne Rice for the smart people\\", I thought - Great! That sounds like my kind of a read.<br />It starts a little slow, but the writing style is fun, easy and charming, so I kept going, but, when I found myself slugging my way through pages and pages of descriptions of the heroine's dinner with the vampire and his rooms and his horses and his wardrobe... you get the picture. It started getting dull.<br />Then came the \\"action\\", if you can call it that. If you ask me, the motivation behind the character's actions and the realism of that motivation is even more important in a fantasy world then it is in the \\"non-fantasy\\" In a world full of magic, you still expect people to act like people. This being said, the heroine of this book makes one asinine decision after another. And she is supposed to be very smart! She stumbles her way from one situation in to another and is constantly acting like a 14 year old around her love interest.<br />I wanted to like it very much, but in the end, it gets 3 stars, because I still like the easy writing style and it isn't terrible, but the story just doesn't cut it. I will not be reading the sequel.

B0086QS7N2|5.0|First of all I have been a fan of Rush since the late 70's (yes I am old, and truth be told I had become a bit disappointed over several of their later albums. It seemed to me that some of the later albums just had a few good songs on them, were as albums like Permanent Waves or 2112 and yes moving pictures, I knew every song.<br /><br />As a diligent fan I have bought every album even if I didn't like every song, and I have seen the boys 13 times in concert. What I am trying to say is I am objective when it comes to Rush albums.<br /><br />When Caravan and Bu2B came out i thought they were ok, not the greatest and I stopped listening to them,but then a few weeks back Headlong flight came out and I was like holy crap thats really good. So I took another listen to Caravan and Bu2b and I was like maybe I just needed context, and all of a sudden those songs clicked in me to.<br /><br />Well today I finally got to put all the pieces together, and context is what its all about. I am a DJ for a living and I have seen the move happening from albums to just putting out single like say what Rihanna does. In fact i heard an interview where Rush was even considering not putting whole albums out any more too.But you see this is where some of the youngsters in the music industry don't get it like Rush does. There is power in the concept. This album is exactly why bands need to still put out albums, and we as consumers still need to buy the whole thing.<br /><br />with the exception of maybe, and that is only a maybe every song on this album is sold. How many rock albums from bands over the last 10 years can you say that about, looking back farther we can, AC?DC back in black / Pink Floyd did it twice with dark side and the wall. NAd rush has done it with Moving Pictures (and as a fan maybe a few others)<br /><br />Some bands just coast in there later years Rush keeps digging from more out of themselves. This in my personal opinion is Rushes best work ever, yes beating moving pictures.<br /><br />As with all Rush albums give yourself a break from reality and kick back with the house speaks set at 11 and enjoy your steam punk trip.

Make Way for Ducklings is one I recently bought for my grand-daughter and we are both enjoying it.<br />We can identify with the family crisis and how the parents sought to solve it. They moved to a new park and a new location.<br />I especially like how Mrs. Mallard taught her babies obedience which is so important in life. i also loved the policeman who ensured the family was safe in traffic.<br /><br />This book is a classic and a MUST READ for the young at heart.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|Stanton's adaptation of \\"A Princess of Mars\\" does a great job capturing the essence of the source material while also improving on it. The character of John Carter is given more depth than in the books, turning him from a borderline misogynist into a hero that struggles with a loss from his past. Deja Thoris, while never weak in the source material, is portrayed as a much stronger and more capable fighter in the film.<br /><br />The realization of Barsoom is stunning. The design is faithful in many places (the Green Martians) but it also is not afraid to take liberties (the White Apes). One design liberty that I personally love is the interpretation of \\"Red Martians\\" as a more tribal description, giving them red tattoos rather than literal red skin. Technically, the effects are flawless. When watching the creatures and characters come to life, it is very clear that this film was crafted by artists from Pixar. The nuance in the performance is heartwarming, whether it's a totally digital creature like Woola, or a performance between two actors like Tars Tarkas and John Carter.<br /><br />There are a few plot points that could be more clear (ex: the Tars Tarkas/Sola/Sarkoja relationship, Kantos Kan is underdeveloped), but that comes from adapting/simplifying an extremely convoluted and serialized story, and nothing particularly detracted from my enjoyment of the film.<br /><br />The film's biggest flaw is and has been it's marketing. The trailers made it look like the deformed love child of \\"Prince of Persia\\" and \\"Attack of the Clones.\\" They failed to sell Andrew Stanton, an Oscar winning Pixar filmmaker. And when you thought it couldn't get worse, the posters feel designed to repel viewers. Just look at the Blu-Ray cover; who would buy that movie? It's hideous and very poorly reflects the film inside.<br /><br />If you want a sense of what this film is, look up any Frank Frazetta painting and imagine the characters with more clothing. That's \\"John Carter.\\" If you wantto see a trailer the reflects the film, look up any of the fan-made legacy trailers.<br /><br />I know a lot of people that saw this movie and were pleasantly surprised. People who'd never heard of the John Carter series, and die hard fans of the books both enjoyed the film. And just looking at the favorable Amazon reviews, I'm pretty confident that this film will be a pleaser.

Better luck to me next buy I suppose.

How can the decision between a date with a `hunk' of meat instead of Taco John be so important?<br /><br />Well, you're in luck because the latest and greatest Paleo MUST READ - It Starts With Food by Dallas and Melissa Hartwig, answers these questions and so many more!  And yes, you read that right - it is \\"THE\\" Dallas and Melissa of Whole9 and Whole30 fame.  If you thought they were good before get ready to have your world rocked because It Starts With Food isn't just another book about paleo - it's a life changer - guaranteed!<br /><br />You're all probably thinking, yeah right- can it really be that much different than \\"The Paleo Solution\\" (which if you still haven't read - you NEED to!!!)?  The answer in short is `yes'.  \\"It Starts With Food\\" picks up where Robb left off - and both of these books are `required reading' for your paleo success.<br /><br />So what exactly makes It Starts With Food so great?  Well, for starters this is a book for everyone.  If you aren't sold on the idea of evolution that's totally okay because this is a book about health not history - \\"creationists welcome\\"!  Additionally, if all that insulin, leptin, cortisol, glucagon stuff is just downright confusing to you be prepared to FINALLY understand it.  Dallas and Melissa do a great job simplifying and highlighting what you need to know about how all that hormone jazz works.  Even more impressive is that they make it fun!  Another highlight of It Starts With Food is that it recognizes and addresses our complex and often dysfunctional relationships with food - it's not something we just chew and swallow. Get ready to be enlightened! You get all this goodness and you're only at Chapter 8 - the best is yet to come!<br /><br />The guts of the masterpiece:  Yep, it's time to talk about FOOD!  Dallas and Melissa explain why certain foods make us \\"less healthy\\", what they do to our bodies and how they do it.  No more questioning why grains are a no go, why dairy is suspect or why Splenda is less than splendid.  It Starts With Food has the answers!  Additionally, the practical application and meal planning pieces of the book make it a must have in and of themselves.  Seriously, this is not the USDA's \\"MyPlate\\" - this is the \\"Whole9 HealthyMePlate\\".  There's a portion guide (don't worry, you don't need measuring cups, a scale or an education in `blocks' to use it), a meal map, and recipes.  If that isn't enough there's a ton of free downloads that come with this literary gem - a shopping list, pantry-stocking guide, dining out guide and meal planning template.  This is the Whole30 Success Guide on steroids (or on Dallas' clean mass gain program)...<br />It Starts With Food has something for everyone from the novice - \\"Pay Leo(paleo)? Why do I need to do that?\\"; to the hardcore - \\"I've done 12 Whole30's, read every book with the word paleo in it, and just ate a raw steak.\\"  Yep, the Whole9 runs the Whole gamut with this one.  If you only have room on your paleo bookshelf for one more book this is it!  Reserve the spot next to \\"The Paleo Solution\\" and your library will be complete.<br /><br />What are you waiting for?  It's time to get going and \\"It Starts With Food\\"!
0345803493|5.0|I ordered this book based on a recommendation from my sister & a friend and it did not disappoint. I see why it's being compared to Twilight because it is very similar, only this movie would definitely be rated R. I definitely enjoyed reading it and I'm glad it was unavailable at the library because I'm glad to own my own copy for future reading.

0345803485|1.0|I was given the three books for my birthday.  With all the hype, I started to read.  These books are hard core porn wrapped in a tissue paper of romance.  They do not belong in the mainstream public.  I'm sure people like them, as people like porn and some do not.  The issue becomes the availability of this material to teenagers and children.  These books belong in an Adult Porn shop.  We, as a society, monitor our TVs, Internet and other forms of media to our children, but let this (in my opinion drivel...it's not even well written), onto our bookshelves for anyone young person to read. It's appalling.  Whoever decided that these books should be allowed to be read by all has been extremely irresponsible.  I assume, it's all about the money and shock value.  I'm ashamed for us all.
B00845PV16|1.0|One of the worst, pathetic, and completely stupidest movies of this year so far. Not sure how they could go from a pretty decent first movie, to a very poorly done second movie, but they did. Do not waste your time. If you want to see it that bad wait for it to come out on red box. At least then you'll only be wasting a dollar!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I love this app and it is totally worth the 99 cents because there are no adds and it's totally addictive. Can't stop playing even after I lose 27 million times. ( I kind of sick) :P! LOVE IT. THE BEST APP I HAVE!
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I had the pleasure of receiving the FanPack 4 days in advance of the release date.  In those 4 days, I have listened to this several times, and each time it gets better and better.  I have been a RUSH fan since the beginning and each one of their records provides something different for me.  This one is no exception.  I must say that I have enjoyed every song on this album and will continue to do so.  I feel that Geddy's vocals are spot on and their musicianship is second to none, period!!!
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Got this book out of curiosity, bought all three actually. Wanted to toss it but read the first and half of the second one. Lots of sex no doubt about that, some of it is even a little edgy for those who lead milk toast lives. Don't waist your money if you are really into life on the edge it will make you scream - and not in a good way.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I heard about this book (and the other two books in the series)from a very straight laced girl friend!!!! She raved about the books and after reading them I can see why. It's good to read a book that you can get lost in, not take too seriously, but can't wait to pick up again. I am constantly surprised at the women who have read these books -  aptly called \\"Mommy Porn\\", a fun read and interesting to see how the other half live (maybe not half, but you know what I mean). Highly recommend for a light weight, very entertaining read (and a little bit educational too).  Enjoy!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|From start to finish this book was an amazing roller coaster ride through the lives of Travis and Abby.<br /><br />McGuire does an amazing job with the character development, especially with the supporting characters. I liked the dynamic between Travis and Abby from the get go and while people may think it got borderline obsessive, I think it is a realistic representation of being young and in love in the 21st century. The tortured soul motif is one I will never get tired of and it builds the story for both characters. The sex scenes were hot and steamy and i think the amount in there were perfect.<br /><br />If you like a steamy love story with a great plot and believable set of characters definitely a must read!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Hard to put down. Great to kill time with while waiting.Can finish any time if you have to put it down.
1613822650|5.0|The Moonstone, a huge yellow diamond purloined from an Indian religious statue, finds its way as an inheritance in this mid-19th century mystery set in England, largely in an estate home.  Ostensibly cursed, the diamond disappears the night it is given to Rachel Verinder.  Who took it?  And why?  These are the questions of the story.  Narrated first-hand by a number of different characters, mostly in chronological order, the tellers' variety and depth vividly reveal Collins' skills with characters.  The narrators are very believable, including the obnoxious one, and their observations of the other characters are insightful and within their roles.  It meshes wonderfully, if slowly, compared to modern whodunits.  This reader docked it a half star because of the setting-appropriate class and chauvinistic issues.  The narrator who speaks the longest, Betteredge, is a septuagenarian head of the staff overseeing the manor's servants.  He contrasts well with the other men, the famed London detective called in, the house guest philanthropist and the family member who is responsible for the delivery of the stone to Rachel.  The attorney and various other lesser characters including the boy and doctor introduced late in the story and the women, the matriarch and Rachel, the religious zealot cousin who does some narrating, the possible suspect brought into the house as help after serving jail time and rehabilitating in a convent, and the relatively few other women are, like the men, fleshed out well.  There's some romance, some duplicity, some ulterior motives, loyalties which may or may not be misguided, and the enjoyable aspects of any book examining lives.  If the modest pace is worth the wonderful characters and well-created mystery for you as they were for me, you, too, will reap the pleasures of Collins' fine ways with words.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|good game but takes a while to get your family but overall a very solid game. I wish the game could progress without waiting

B004HW7JH4|4.0|Season 5 avoids most of the modern sensationalism of season 4.  It does not however reach the artistry of season 2 or 3 in either historical setting or character development.  There were some great moments. But the season 5 story arcs of the major characters go nowhere except for Pete and Joan.  Indepth character exploration of Don and Betty don't occur.  We do find out more about Lane and Meghan.  Roger is still horny.  Peggy's story inches forward, but possibly to yet another spinoff the authors may find hard to tie back into the overall storyline.  The finale is truly weak.  Disappointing considering the writers had a season of delay in which to pull together the broken shards of Don/Betty's divorce, and the dissolution/rebirth of the business.  Season 5 ends with the \\"cliffhangers\\" of the firm moving into a larger office (wow!), and Don being tempted at a bar (gasp!).  Costume design is still a royal treat though!!  Compared with most shows, I give it four stars.  Compared against itself, I give it three.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|When I heard that not only Rush would release a new album, but for the first time a new release from my favorite band of 30 plus years released on my birthday, so I really hoped that they would release a nice piece of work, AND THEY SUCCEEDED !!! I listened to this twice already and each song kicks ass, and has me on my feet nonstop, going back to a conceptional work, since Hemespheres is a nice change in the directions they always amaze us with, but this album also sounds fresh, and full of new ideas, and NO Geddy don't scream in his vocals anymore ( not that he could anymore anyways ), this album is a much heavier album, then even Vapor Trails and Counterparts, which were pretty heavy for thier time. After an almost 40 year career , RUSH still knows how to deliver the goods and know how to keep themsleves creative,which other long time bands tend to get in a rut, and a lot of new bands can't even touch the talents of this trio. Thank you RUSH for the best b-day gift I have had in such a long time,
0345803485|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.It was very erotic and descriptive. Yes I would also read the othber books in the series, hopefully they are just as good.
B002QKZLZ6|1.0|The mike boom on my last Voyager Pro headset broke in my pocket after a year or so of use, so this case seemed like a good idea.<br /><br />I had checked the Plantronics website before ordering, to make sure the Pro HD would fit. But despite the site saying it was compatible, it turned out to be an very snug fit, likely to cause wear and tear just getting it in and out. Also, the case seemed a bit flimsy, not offering a lot of protection.<br /><br />But these turned out to be minor issues compared to my next discovery.<br /><br />I wear jeans all the time with a fairly wide leather belt. The narrow clip on this case did not extend fully across the jeans belt so it was secured by friction only. On day two it popped off my belt and was lost. Luckily the headset was not in the case at the time. I thought about contacting Plantronics and asking for another case but realized this would be tantamount to throwing away the headset, and almost certainly sooner rather than later.<br /><br />For an office worker who wears a thin dress belt, the case might work. But that's not how I roll.
0307730697|5.0|This is a book is about one ultimate warrior, Adam Brown, a member of a very elite branch of our military service, a branch of service that does not get public exposure and because it is so elite it has been somewhat of a \\"secret society\\" which little was known.  The book gives you a glimmer inside this unit but the focus is on the heart and mind of one particular SEAL, Adam Brown.  The book touches on combat to highlight what Adam, as well as his brothers in arms endure during those moments, not the combat itself.  Adam's fellow SEALs, all ultimate warriors, gave Adam the highest respect as he was the exceptional ultimate warrior.  He touched many hearts and he will touch yours as well.<br /><br />Adam was a remarkable individual who hit a very rough spot in his life, but the love of a very special woman, his wife, pulled him out of that rough spot.  Adam dedicated himself to his faith in God, his family, and his job, all of which brought out the best in him, which he balanced with equal emotion, love and dedication.  At the tender age of 36 Adam gave his life for his country and left an amazing legacy.<br /><br />I won't repeat what has been stated in other reviews, but this book brought me closer to my country, learning about and reminding me of what our military will do to make the ultimate sacrifice for this country, protecting our freedoms and rights while showing a deep compassion to those who are denied those freedoms and rights.<br /><br />I know that a documentary has been made about Adam, but this book is worthy of a movie as there are so many elements to being a SEAL, which run far deeper than the average human being and would serve as a reminder to all Americans as to who protects this country, what they go through to attain that level of excellence and why they are heros.<br /><br />Introduce yourself to Adam and read this book.  His story will remain with you for a very long time.
B0018CWEYY|2.0|I guess I must be a total idiot - at least in the opinion of the ardent fans of Lost.  I'm finding the never-ending plot twists and new characters so hard to follow that I'm losing interest in the series.  The continual twists seem too over-the-top and have taken the show from enjoyable to something that's too complicated and far-fetched to be entertaining.  And yes, I bought several seasons and sat and watched them for hours and hours, back-to-back (recovering from surgery).  Season four is the first time I've found that the writers seem to be grasping at straws in order to keep the story going. I know I'm in the minority here but unless these many loose threads start knitting together and making sense soon, I'm going to forget about season five.<br /><br />Hopefully, I haven't made any spelling or grammar errors in my review or I'll be absolutely attacked by the 5-star gang for disagreeing with them.  Sigh...

B004J4WKTW|3.0|I read this book after all the hoopla about it. Okay, if you love fantasy for fantasy's sake. To me, it seemed the author wrote to amuse herself, and she indulged this amusement for far too long. The present tense got wearing after the first hundred or so pages. The 'game' the main characters played held my interest somewhat--not compelling as it dragged on and on and on. By the book's end I didn't care what happened to either of them. Also, there were way too many characters who served no real purpose to the narrative. The book was mostly narrative from the author's viewpoint.<br /><br />On the positive side, the author's phraesology was beautiful in most instances, often like poetry. Being a circus, albeit a magical circus, odd characters were expected. They were there. Several of the minor characters held my interest more than the two main characters. Especially the Murray twins, Widget and Poppet. I salute the author for the sheer task of putting down so many words.

B0060ZJ7BC|4.0|I think you have to be a baseball fan to enjoy this slow-paced adaptation of Michael Lewis' [[ASIN:0393338398 book]].  I thought Brad Pitt was very good as Billy Beane, and Jonah Hill excellent as Peter Brand, who used Bill James' [[ASIN:0879464739 methods]] to evaluate ballplayers and help Beane rebuild a team on a relatively shoe-string budget at Oakland.  The film offers flashbacks to Beane's playing time, a kid with great potential but had failed to measure up to the big leagues.  This seemed to influence Beane's decision to play the percentages rather than become overly enamored with a ball player's swing or the crack of the bat.  Beaneball, as it would come to be called, worked predominantly with on-base percentages, driving scouts and manager Art Howe up the wall.  There are a lot of nice personal touches in the film, such as Beane's relationship to his 12-year-old daughter and his attempts to reach out to his players when the A's were in a big slump.  The film captures the emotional high of the A's improbably 20-game run, and the low of their playoff defeat to the Twins.  For Beane, it was all about winning the last game.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|I like to review albums from bands who \\"the mainstream\\" radio stations dismiss after their \\"glory years\\" have faded - which in real people speak means they just don't make them the kind of money these very radio stations and corporations demand anymore. My local rock radio station plays Rush at least once a day when I'm out doing errands in the car, but it's always the same songs, as a reminder they existed once, but time has whisked them away, favoring the newer garbage that is mostly unlistenable.<br /><br />Well, here it is, album number 20 for the trio from Canada, and this album sounds just as fresh as anything out there. The album explodes out of the speakers with a rapid crystal-clear urgency and tells a wonderful story about a traveler's magical journey, and this time, it's time that is the enemy. Who isn't madly mindful of it when we're out doing what we have to do to survive?<br /><br />(This isn't your everyday Rush album, as a novelization of the album is coming out soon.)<br /><br />12 songs adding up to just over an hour:<br /><br />01. Caravan - this song is about travel, and movement, and the journey begins, steampunk style. Steam engines take our traveler as he thinks about what he setting out to do - find out more truth, find out the meaning of life,and everything in between. The pumping base and vocals of Geddy Lee, the master drumwork of Neal Peart, and the pounding urgent finger work of guitarist Alex Lifeson (along with the unofficial fourth member, producer Nick \\"Booujzhe\\" Raskulinecz), have never - and I really mean this - have never sounded fresher and more dedicated to opening an album filled with endless drums, guitar and bass, to make it sound as if ten times the music is there. This is one of the finest and more majestical openings to a Rush album since \\"Overture\\" on the album \\"2112.\\"<br /><br />02. BU2B  - \\"Brought Up To Believe\\" gives you the real groundwork and story of the album, even though Rush themselves have said that they weren't going to make another \\"concept album.\\" The vocals are almost swallowed up by the wonderful machine-gun beats and micro-solos, and Geddy tells us the Watchmaker is there watching us all, as he \\"loves us all to death.\\"<br /><br />03. Clockwork Angels - Flying through time, through life, over cities and people and the freedom to simply go and soar higher and higher. This song is the meat of the album, and takes me to a dizzying height, with time itself becoming the demons the angels fight without weapons, the very hands of the clock become swords to battle and fight the marching soldiers of time away - but we all know that game is lost, and the band has simply dazzled me with this over seven minute monster of a song. It's a masterful production.<br /><br />04. The Anarchist - this is one of the more straightforward songs off the album so far, but it also really isn't. The beat and the drumming and the vocals are there so tightly intertwined, and yet there is so much chaos in the lyrics itself - this is one angry man, so angry about his lost opportunities not to enjoy his life or to simply sing: \\"A missing part of me that grows around me like a cage...\\"<br /><br />05. Carnies - We immediately fall into the magical secretive world of the carnival, with it's deceptive lights and \\"demon music and gypsy queens.\\" To a young boy, the freedom and swirling spirits floating around him could be intoxicating, but it could also be a beautiful trap, too! Once again, the guitarwork of Lifeson lays the song on it's ear and spins the listener around and around and around with it's old-timey retro but still fresh as hell tricks. A great song.<br /><br />06. Halo Effect - this is almost a love song, and this will be the song of the album to sing along to when they play it in concert, guaranteed. Deceiving angels, illusions, and what we see may not be what we think it may really be...<br /><br />07. Seven Cities Of Gold - A fool's paradise, and a fool thinking about the past, and it's our paradise lost, too. They've got it right, \\"a man can lose himself in a country like this...\\" This is an over  seven-minute song dedicated to the folly of a lost man's failures, and the dreams he might have had once as a young man, and Geddy nails it when he says \\"that gleam in the distance could be heaven's gate, a long-awaited treasure at the end of my cruel fate.\\" Another wonderful song with a solo will destroy anyone's notions that Rush are just laying down over 35 years later. They never have, and I expect with songs like this, they never will.<br /><br />08. The Wreckers - this song almost went towards U2 territory with it's extended opening, but the story is anything but that middle-of-the-road garbage Bono spews. Lee and company explain very carefully that like the breakers at the ocean's shore, everything is deceiving, and just when you think you're at your safest, that's when you run aground and it gets really ugly really fast. The truth, brutal as it can be, can kill with just slightest flick of it's wrist. This song nails the painfulness of what happens when you weren't expecting it and it broadsides you so hard, it kinda sucks.<br /><br />09. Headlong Flight - another over seven-minute monster, and I can only equate it's importance to Rush fans as Pink Floyd fans cherish \\"Learning To Fly.\\" This song is about flight, and wonderful youthful memories, and massive regret, and the sad rigid responsibilites you MUST have now, so forget what you thought when you were a kid! You steer the ship, you punch the timeclock, and someone behind you does the same exact thing. This song reminds you that back there, somewhere in your memory, you were the king (or queen) of your whole universe, but now you just have what it is now. Neal Peart's drums dominate this song, and the bass beat and the guitar try but just barely keep up with your memories! This song is an opus, and a fantastic work.<br /><br />10. BU2B2 - \\"Brought Up To Believe Too\\" is a reprise of sorts of it's older brother, but boy oh boy this is more like a final determination by your job's management before they fire you. The carpet gets pulled out from under you, and you've just given up. This song segues right into...<br /><br />11. Wish Them Well - sometimes you have to look at the bigger picture and let it go. The band's advice? Just wish them well and walk away. there are better places to be, better people to know, better jobs to take, better places to simply live in. This song, after the last four or five that have had such a hard edge, now comes off as positive, almost like a pat on the shoulder, as if they're trying to tell you that it's okay to lose sometimes and sometimes you just gotta move on. The sound is positive, and uplifting, and almost reassuring in it's tone.<br /><br />12. The Garden - Sometimes you've got to step back, and understand that time is our friend, even though it's only purpose is to jeep going once we've been laid in the dirt. And what is our garden? It's our safe place, our slowly moving sun and cool starry nights, and not even time Itself can take those things away from our minds, and our hearts. This song is a mellow reflection and almost seven minute calm down, and it's Rush's way of saying hey! it's okay to dream, and sometimes it's okay to forget, too. Hope is there, and forever waits for the right person to take flight again. Personally, I've never encountered such an unusual ending from any of Rush's albums, but they've got it 100 percent right, time is just a measure of our lives, and what we do with it is the most important thing.<br /><br />So what can I say except that I give this new album 5 wonderful and healthy stars.<br /><br />Rush has always been one of those bands who can make you scream and shout and rock one moment, and then the next really contemplate the meaning behind the rock. I've said it before, and I'll say it again, and very proudly, too - Rush can play, and they can create, and they can make you step intoother far-off worlds you never dreamed existed, even though you don't even have to leave your room.<br /><br />I really really want you to check out this album and enjoy their story, and enjoy their fantasy, and understand that the album is only and hour of your life, but boy is it worth it - you'll be glad you did!<br /><br />p.s. - the album cover? look at the time on the clock, and look at it from a military point of view... it's 21:12, people...<br /><br />(thanks for reading and check out my other reviews here on Amazon!)'s older brother, but boy oh boy this is more like a final determination by your job's management before they fire you.

0345803485|1.0|So sorry I gave in to the hype and downloaded this book to my kindle.  I couldn't wait to be done with it and i'm soooooooo glad I didnt download the trilogy.  This book was so poorly written.  Very shallow character development and even the sex was just OK.  Not even really that much sex in it.....mostly Ana wondering, wishing, crying, fantasizing, etc.  I was so sick of Anastasia whining and whimpering about her situation.  SUCKED.
B005LAIH3G|4.0|In my opinion, this is Disney's answer to 3D Avatar. The movie is very well done, use of 3D is about average, with nothing popping out of the screen that I can recall. Pop out is what I like most in 3D, but that's just me. The Director of the movie said he sought to be true to the book(s), and he was just that to the BOOKS. By that I mean that IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THE BOOKS, you'll be lost and not able to follow the story. However if you HAVE read the books (there's 13 in total, by Edgar Rice Burroughs) then you'll understand the movie. By the way, you can get the books on your NOOK for free by searching for $0.00 in the Nook book store. It's bound to be a classic, if for no other reason that the CEO of Disney resigned over this movie, because it wasn't the box office hit they were banking on. However, this will make a good addition to your 3D Blu-Ray collection.

B0058YPG1G|5.0|Might be one of the greatest shows ever and BB Season 4 was the best season to date. Cranston, Paul and Giancarlo Esposito were all spectacular this year. Sad that they are only going to do 2 more seasons, but I guess it had to end sometime. Loads of great extras on this DVD. Commentaries on every episode and the ones with Vince Gilligan (series creator), Bryan Cranston or Dean Norris on them are particularly fun. Nice behind the scenes feature on the season finale too. If you have started watching this show yet I'd highly recommend some power watching of season 1-4 because season 5 is starting up on AMC next month.
B007JVJ3C4|1.0|Just found out this isn't a real digital copy but ultraviolet.  now i have to return cause it doesn't download to my itunes library to stream with my apple tvs!  UGH
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I couldn't put it down. I think I read all three of them in less than a week. I have to admit some of the scenes will make a girl blush!
B0086700CM|5.0|i have really been waiting for the kindle fire to get this app because i had it on the 4shared app but it didnt work very welland one day i deleted apps and got on the app store to get new ones and i saw it and got so excited so take my advice and get this app now for free before the cost rises up!!!!!!!!!
B007I2BZIE|5.0|This album is great! I'm not going to go on and on because a lot of people already said it better than I could. I'll simply state that I discovered Rush late with their album \\"Counterparts\\" and have been buying up all of their stuff over the years. So since I'm not a purist from their early days, it is very easy for me to enjoy their new albums while also enjoying their older works. These guys still rock hard. They have not let up an ounce since their youthful days, in fact; I think they might be playing even harder.<br /><br />I love concept albums and this is no exception. While it took me a few listens to really appreciate \\"Vapor Trails\\", \\"Clockwork Angels\\" hit me hard and put a smile on my face from the first listen.<br /><br />Sound quality is great! Listened on a decent stereo at work and it was very impressive. Can't wait to get home and give it a real sit-down listen on a pair of Grado headphones.<br /><br />Thanks to all the Rush fans for showing your support and rating this great album! I hope it isn't overlooked.
0345803485|5.0|This was a great deal on such an amazing book.  I payed half the price I would have in a store and it shipped really quick.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|fun with charming characters and easy gameplay for the kids. nice graphics and cool little narrative bits between levels at times.
0345803485|5.0|I bought Fifty Shades of Grey just to see what it was all about.  I read it in a day and then had to wait impatiently until the next 2 books arrived from amazon.  Read those 2 books in 4 days.  I have since re-read the books 3 times.  Loved the characters and exciting sex.  It is really a very hot love story.  All my friends have now read them and loved it too!!!
B0060ANOXY|5.0|Whether you ARE or ARE NOT familiar with Roger Waters' earlier works, it is difficult to ignore Brilliance; and with \\"Amused to Death\\", you will enjoy not simply the FANTASTIC \\"Q\\" SOUND; but Lyrics and Music that are obviously from the mind and hands of Roger Waters.<br />The time-line of a Gulf War era is expressed here most vididly and Uniquely; BUT, this Masterpiece of music is NOT for the simplistic, or the casual listener.  This is, in my opinion, Waters FINEST work; cutting and sharp and thought out by a musician who has a great talent with obsessiveness, and why not? He has created many OTHER brilliant pieces since 1967; but the completeness and complexity of \\"Amused to Death\\" is another \\"pinnacle\\" reached by Waters.  If you want more than background \\"musique\\", I most HIGHLY recommend this 2-LP set, or, if you MUST, the CD.  A Columbia \\"Gold\\" CD is also available for the discerning and well pocketed.  In any event, you will be rewarded by your choice. I don't like to use the term \\"Genius\\", (but I Will) for \\"Amused to Death\\".
0345803493|5.0|Great hot sexy love story.  Loved the writing and the characters.  Great ending although I was ready to read another book about Christian and Ana and their family.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|After seeing Hugh Laurie live with the Copper Bottom Band we knew we wanted his CD.  We were not surprised that he was good at singing, playing guitar, and piano, but we were surprised at just how at home he was singing songs from New Orleans.  You think it's wild that he speaks with an American accent so perfectly as an actor, wait until you hear him sing blues with not only the right accent but pouring the right heart into it.  Hugh Laurie is multi-talented, to say the least.  There is truly something about this man's presence that draws you in and I wish it was possible to meet with him and just talk.  Without that happening, I would guess this is probably as close to knowing Laurie as you can get.  Excellent CD.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is the best its a game for all ages and so amusing and entertaining I could play it for hours
B000P0J06U|5.0|Batman Returns (1992) is quite different than its predecessor, Batman from 1989. The first Batman movie was dark, yes, but had lots of humor, courtesy of the Joker. This time, Tim Burton creates an even darker atmosphere and depicts his main villain (Penguin) as even more menacing and darker than the Joker. Catwoman is a somewhat complex character, and was more violent than dark, in my opinion. The idea of putting Catwoman and Penguin in the same movie was a calculated risk, because it can be somewhat distracting to have two villains, but I can see why they did it. Perhaps the Penguin wasn't going to be seen as charismatic enough (like the Joker was), so they needed someone like Catwoman to offset this deficiency. I will say that there was some good chemistry there, and the two villains seem to complement one another. Tim Burton manages to masterfully create atmospheres for his movies, and I absolutely love the darkness to this movie. And of course Michael Keaton is the perfect Bruce Wayne, and he delivers another memorable performance. I thought that Danny DeVito did a great job as the Penguin as well. This movie is eye candy, but with a good plot and great acting.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I have been a Rush fan since 1980 and I have been waiting for a record to come along for a very very long time from Rush to move me the way this record does. This record is hands down the best record since 1989's \\"Presto\\" and sits comfortably amongst the ranks of \\"Power Windows\\", \\"Signals\\", \\"Grace Under Pressure\\", \\"Moving Pictures\\", \\"Hemispheres\\" and \\"Permanent Waves\\". If you took each of those records and threw \\"Presto\\" in there you would have \\"Clockwork Angels\\". Neil Peart has finally returned to playing with reckless incredible passion and has given us his best drumming performance since \\"Power Windows\\". Geddy Lee is again RUSH. Everything the guy does is just so spot on. Alex Lifeson has taken his playing to an all new level of emotion and has shown why he should be up with Eddie Van Halen in the reader's polls at the end of the year for best guitarist or best rock album...he really just takes you back on a journey through his entire career and then douses you with touching chords you have never heard from his fingers.<br /><br />Caravan - Remixed and just the ideal Rush bone chiller.<br />BU2B - New intro and re-mixed with some incredible production.<br />Clockwork Angels - This is a combo of something 1984 Rush and 2012 Rush meeting in an alley and kicking the crap out of each other sounds like. Just a flawless song.<br />The Anarchist - Brilliant. Just what heavy Rush fans have been waiting for if they didn't like the heaviness of \\"Counterparts\\" or \\"Vapor Trails\\".<br />Carnies - Alex Lifeson and Geddy's vocal melody...forget about it. Insanely great.<br />Halo Effect - Could be the greatest ballad ever written from Rush...granted they have only a handful of them but this is cinematic and just stunning...gives you chills. Running time just over 3 mins and perfect for radio.<br />Seven Cities of Gold - With an opening like this...I don't even need to tell you what the rest of the song has in store for you. More proof they can own anyone in the jam department when they want to.<br />The Wreckers - This song took a bit to grow on me at first but the chorus will stay in your head for days...addicting.<br />Headlong Flight - If \\"Hemispheres\\", \\"Caress of Steel\\", and \\"Permanent Waves\\" is your era? This is your track.<br />BU2B2 - This is technically filler in the storyline and not really a song imo..more of a segue between songs in the storyline.<br />Wish Them Well - I promise you...if you listen to this song 10 times in a row...it just might become one of your top 3 favorite songs on the record. Some of Neil's most humanizing and relate-able lyrics he has ever written. Think of Carve Away The Stone meets Entre Nous...such a gem.<br />The Garden - Easily the most moving Rush song written since The Pass. This song will touch you on so many levels you won't know what to do with yourself at the end of it.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|It makes us think about things we should appreciate but don't really think about, after all we are all worried about things that are not important for us as human beings. A lesson of how to live our lives more fully, thankful for what we have and happy.
B008AG3PK8|5.0|After the recent melodrama surrounding pandering, prostitution and suicide it was good to see Mad Men get back to its roots of contemplative, quiet desperation. The stand-out character in this episode, is of all people, Megan's mother. The writer's and the actress establish in just a few scenes a woman I would like to know with trenchant precision. She demystifies Megan's forays into acting and depression for Don and disillusions him as well. Megan it seems has the artistic temperament but not the artistic talent. Another dollbaby bites the dust for Don, though the unraveling will no doubt take up much of next season.<br /><br />Quiet Lane and his suicide continues to spread quiet ripples, all the more sad as they barely disturb the pond. It turns out that under Lane's management the company is doing quite well financially, even during the lean times Lane had to manage with prudence. It is all Joan can do not to point that out during a board meeting. Lane's wife tries to put Don in his place during his condolence call and show him where he went wrong, how successful she is remains to be seen.<br /><br />Peggy is about to get a cigarette that is as iconic as Lucky Strike was for Don and it is even more iconic in terms of what it symbolizes for the show, the times and the women of the show. I hope this storyline is pursured next season, but the idea is so brilliant and the references to it so sly I don't see how it could be dropped.<br /><br />All of our characters are facing the truth about themselves and their circumstances and all of them realize that somehow, despite success and money that they are not as happy as they envisioned. Not that they or we were happy with the poverty and the hardship that represented most lives before WWII. Mad Men concentrates on the emptiness of the pursuit of wealth and success but isn't quite so naive as to try and tell us that what America ran from was better than what America ran toward.<br /><br />An episode of contempation with no conclusions reached. The Mad Men writers must be very careful that they don't break under the weight of their own symbolism. America's fall from innocence and her headlong run into materialism are rich ground but only if the observations and conclusions aren't cliched. The most obvious cliche being that America was ever as innocent as nostalgia will portray it or that a concentration on the material always brings unhappiness. A good episode, but lacking the punch of other Mad Men Season Finales and where it ranks depends on the overall vision for Mad Men by its creator. A minus.no conclusions reached.

0345528581|5.0|I am very happy with this book.  It provides pictures, detailed directions, and over 125 different strength training exercises along with different ways to make each exercise more or less difficult.  It even has tipes for how to get around doing certain moves with random objects that would be basic to any household. Great and definitely worth the cost.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie is very well produced, the quality of acting is great, and the message is awesome. I watch very few movies more than once, but this one I bought.
0470638842|1.0|I read this book in 90 minutes. And that is not a compliment. The book is oversimplified to the point of being banal. I felt like it was written for the 65+ crowd, who have never heard of social media. If you've been paying attention over the last 5 years, or have visited Facebook or Youtube during that time, than this book is a complete waste of time. It's essentially a collection of poorly worded, over-earnest case studies that don't really serve to teach you anything you didn't already know.<br /><br />Don't bother.
B00884GR0W|5.0|fantastic game, the developers are very accomdating to fix any problems the game has had. I was wary to purchase, but then I saw that the developers addressed all the  reviews and fixed the flaws they mentioned as well as encouraging suggestions. That level of customer service is fantastic an unheard of in today's market.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Really enjoy the game.  To get out of game go to options and at the bottom. of the list click. on what looks like a book
B0086700CM|4.0|This game definitely keeps you in your toes. If you don't pat attention you will either face plant onto a tree or run off the trail. Fun. Fun. Fun.
B005J9ZE5I|5.0|One of the most crazy horror epic of all time. This Evil dead 2 version is the one to own. It have all the special features of the special edition DVD [[ASIN:6305841861 Evil Dead II]] and as I said in the title of this review the transfer is fantastic. Very clear if you have all the tools to take advantage of the Blu-ray.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is great and I recomend you get this game because it challenges you to complete a game and it is very entertaining
B00169N0BK|3.0|The ColorMunki system produced results which varied very little from using my Mac's built-in monitor calibrator and Epson's own paper profile.<br /><br />My setup includes an '08 24\\" iMac, OS 10.6.8, Photoshop CS5, and an Epson 7880 wide format printer. I actually like the whole ColorMunki approach. Calibrating the monitor, profiling the printer and paper and then scanning printer output to fine tune the profile all sounded great and I was very excited about incorporating it into my workflow. But after 3 separate calibrate/profile/print sessions I realized it simply was not going to give me the WYSIWYG results that X-Rite promised in their advertising.<br /><br />I still think this is a decent product - just not great. And since I can't afford over $400.00 for something that shows no perceptible improvement over my current setup - I'll be returning it to Amazon.
B0086700CM|5.0|I just love how the monkeys chase the guy and he gathers coins at the same time! you can even buy a different character with the coins you gather. SO AWESOME! GET IT NOWWWWWWW
B006RUJST6|5.0|4.5 stars.<br /><br />Don't make the same mistake I did, putting off reading this because you think it is about slam poetry. I could not put this book down once I started and immediately downloaded book 2.<br /><br />I would also suggest not reading any reviews that allude to the storyline. The main characters and their stories hit every emotion out there. The secondary characters are also well written. Just when you think you know what is coming, something else comes and smacks you in the face.<br /><br />This book would probably even make Chuck Norris shed a tear
B0080SZ0V8|3.0|This game was a lot of fun at the beginning with the scenes and hidden object puzzles to solve.  The mini games were fun too but once the games starting repeating over and over and you couldn't skip them they weren't fun anymore especially if you don't have orbs to get rid of them.  The robot game seems impossible to do and it keeps coming up.  I wish they had different mini games at each level.
1907563202|5.0|I just love this pattern book.  New fresh ideas for crochet.  If you love crochet this is a keeper.  Great addition to anyone's crafting library.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|I am totally addicted to Downton Abbey and anything associated with it immediately grabs my attention.  My daughter and I recently hosted a Bridal shower for a young woman who is also a fan of the series.  We used the concept of a high tea during the Edwardian Era.  It was fun, it was delicious AND we had a great resource in both the DVD's as well as the internet. Smashing!
1936608898|5.0|Review of It Starts With Food<br /><br />You know how you look forward to Christmas morning? Even as an adult, you wake up a bit early, filled with expectation? That's the way I felt waiting for It Starts With Food to arrive in the mail. I was fortunate enough to receive an advance copy to review, and as luck would have it, my copy arrived just before Memorial Day weekend. I spent three days sitting in the sun (soaking up Vitamin D!) while reading this book with a highlighter in one hand and a pen in the other.<br /><br />I recommend that you buy a few highlighters before your copy arrives! You will most definitely want to take notes in the book and mark things to refer to later. This book is filled with good information throughout. Whether you are brand new to the idea of eating real food, or a seasoned veteran, you will open this book again and again over the years to refresh your thinking on important topics such as hormonal factors which influence our brain and body (insulin, leptin, glucagon, and cortisol), the mechanism behind leaky gut syndrome (bouncers defending Club Body), inflammation and autoimmune illnesses, balancing Omega 3 and 6 consumption, and emotional factors that drive our nutrition choices.<br /><br />Along with the good science-y stuff, It Starts With Food teaches you how to plan meals, what a portion looks like, and how to create a meal focusing on delicious, healthy ingredients rather than complicated recipes. They discuss nutrition for special populations (pregnant women, kids, folks with autoimmune illnesses, active individuals and vegetarians/vegans) to help fine tune the plan for your individual needs. I have referred to this section several times in the past few weeks while consulting with my clients, as I tend to see folks who have a number of issues that they are trying to address through nutrition.<br /><br />I love Dallas and Melissa's ability to say really brilliant things in short, easy to understand one-liners. I don't want to spoil the fun for you; but, here are a few of my favorites:<br />* With regards to the myths about Paleo: \\"We are far more concerned with health than we are with history.\\"<br />* With regards to research, clinical experience, and observation: \\"Scientific research + Clinical Experience +  Self-experimentation\\" = win-win-win.<br />* Persistent biological signals lead us to overeat sweet, fatty, salty foods while keeping us malnourished.<br />* It's all about hormones.<br />* You cannot \\"out-exercise\\" poor food choices and the resulting hormonal disruption.<br />* Sugar = sugar = sugar.<br />* Gluten-free is not a get-out-of-jail-free card.<br />* This does require effort on your part.<br />* Start thinking of eating as a nourishing experience.<br />* You are not that busy, you just choose to spend your time elsewhere (in regards to sitting down to eat well prepared, nutritious, delicious foods).<br />* This. Is. Not. Hard. (when compared to birthing a baby, quitting heroin, or beating cancer).<br />* At some point, you need to start making positive, sustainable changes in other areas of your life too, so...<br />* Don't (only) look for a nutritional solution to a lifestyle problem.<br /><br />The best news is that It Starts With Food will begin shipping on June 12th, so the wait is almost over! I highly suggest that you buy this book (I recommend the hardcover so you can use your highlighter, but I tend to be old school!). You will refer to this book over and over as you continue your journey to health. I am so impressed by Whole 9's first book, and happy to call Dallas and Melissa friends.

0345803493|4.0|Purchased for my Mom-in-law for Mother's day . She finished all 3 books in 2 weeks. I borrowed them & so far find myself captivated by the subject matter. I can understand the controversy these books have caused as they borderline the obscene & taboo. Characters are intriguing from the start. I find the writing lighthearted and humorous and that keeps me wanting more. However, if you are uncomfortable with the subject of \\"Sexual Domination\\" and the details within then the \\"Shades\\" series isn't for you. Overall, I recommend this series for any \\"40-something\\" year old wife/mom who loves to read as well as spice up her OWN sex life at home! (I can't leave my husband alone when I put the book down at night!)
0345803485|5.0|The best I have read so far. I can't put this book down. I don't want it to end, I hope there will be more than 3 books??? =(
0385006896|5.0|I decided to buy the entire collection of Doyle's Sherlock Holmes book after downloading a free version of \\"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\\" on my kindle. I came to the conclusion that the book I downloaded was only one of many and not the first, and I was correct. I loved what I had, and just had to buy the entire set. Doyle is a brilliant writer, and his characters are well-defined and have a witty sense of humor. I find his stories highly entertaining. You can't beat the classics, after all.<br /><br />First, let me say that I have no problem with the size of the text. I suspect there is more than one version of this book going around, because contrary to what other reviews have claimed, the text looks perfectly fine to me. My book is 1122 pages long. Each page is slightly fringed for effect and is bound very nicely to am undamaged spine. I can see that the book has been used (I ordered the cheapest I could find, after all), but the wear is so slight that it is almost unnoticeable. The cover is in great condition, and it even came with a dust jacket, which I wasn't expecting. My version looks different from the one depicted- the paper cover is a burnt umber with a sketch of Holmes on the front, and the hardcover is dark brown with a black spine. But I actually prefer this over the one in the picture; I think the color is more fitting than teal and blue.<br /><br />That being said, I am very happy with this order. It came in on time, and I was able to track it, which is always nice. I highly suggest this book to anyone who likes to read. There's a reason it's remained this popular for so many years!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is great. I have it on my kindle an my iphone. my mother has it aswell. we get competitive over who has the bigger town.
B007Z9RS22|4.0|This modern version is easier to get than the original. Same storynline but the actors here soften the story and make it easier to empathize with. Keanu is brilliant and young lady very very real. Enjoy!
B006M7JCC2|5.0|This is one of the most inspiring and profound books I've ever read. Not only does it provide tremendous reassurance about what awaits us after death as we reunite with the great Source of all life, but it also amazed me with the healing potential we each have when we engage fully with this fundamental spirit within each of us. It also deeply addresses a view that transcends and yet unites all the diverse religions of the world, taking us beyond dogma to the essence behind them.  It's a book that is better read than described: read it!  You'll be glad you did!
B0086700CM|5.0|this is a very creepy game. u r chased by some werid monkey things. but its very addicting. i really like it but i try not to trip because then i hav to see those monkey/zombies.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|This is one of the most well-made shows I have seen.  I enjoyed the first book in Martin's series when I read it a few years ago, but I enjoyed this season of the HBO series much more.  The script, the casting, the acting, and the directing are all excellent.  My girlfriend, who does not normally enjoy science fiction or fantasy series, loves it.<br />These blu-ray disks are high quality.  The picture and sound are excellent. The menus are intuitive and consistent. The commentary is interesting and worthwhile.<br />The series depicts graphic violence and rough sex.  I would not recommend this for kids.
B007ZT2Q88|5.0|So the Ig Man has loved this kind of music since he was a boy. He's a fan of Sinatra and the Rolling Stones. On this album he sings ballads that celebrate the desire for life and love.<br /><br />He's always sung about those themes even when he did the \\"one and only\\" Raw Power. Even \\"Death Trip\\" was a cry for more life and more love.....<br /><br />Osterberg's got a great voice and he sounds relaxed and warm on this album. Maybe it's Miami or maybe it's France, it doesn't matter, he's enjoying life and good for him. He's earned his peace. When he quits,<br /><br />I believe I will too...
B0051CSIKQ|4.0|Very well shot and atmospheric. Beautiful cinematography, locations, and soundtrack. A little redundant and ultimately a bit anti-climatic, but the latter was to be expected considering the plot (i.e. vampires overran the earth, let's find shelter, this place won't hold up, let's take some people with us to the next place, repeat). The script also lacked depth at times, but overall an excellent viewing experience. A good mix of characters, many of which you actually become invested in, and solid acting all-around.<br /><br />One thing I found particularly interesting was that the film moved by as if it were adapted from a video game. I could see an adaptation of Gears of War looking something like this, for example. Gorehounds won't be impressed by any means, but there was enough in the blood/violence department to keep a splatterfreak like me satiated. (I was specifically impressed by the accuracy of the color and texture, but there were some unnecessary CGI moments.)<br /><br />FFO: Dawn of the Dead (re-make)/28 Days Later, Let the Right One In/A l'Interieur.
1936608898|5.0|Not since Paleo nutritional health stalwart Robb Wolf released his groundbreaking 2010 New York Times bestselling book [[ASIN:0982565844 The Paleo Solution: The Original Human Diet]] have I been THIS excited about a nutritional health book. And while the co-authors Dallas and Melissa Hartwig are not necessarily enthusiastic advocates of the low-carb lifestyle that I love and cherish, they are big time believers in another concept I embrace and appreciate-that is, eating real, whole foods that nourish your body so that you can be both optimally healthy and as disease-free as humanly possible. This Paleo power couple has been promoting their unique path to \\"magical\\" success with literally thousands of clients who have gone through The Whole30 program since they founded the Whole9 in 2009. And now they stand on the precipice of bringing this simple yet powerful message to a new generation of people who are desperate for answers about how to deal with their obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, hypothyroidism, Celiac disease, infertility and so much more with the release of their extraordinary book entitled It Starts With Food: Discover the Whole30 and Change Your Life in Unexpected Ways.<br /><br />The positive energy that Dallas and Melissa exude is so utterly contagious within the pages of this book that you'll become super-excited about starting your very own Whole30 journey head first right away. And whether you realize it yet or not, the fact that you are reading reviews like this one means your journey to change is already underway. No matter what your health reasons are for wanting to make a change in your life, it all really does \\"start with food.\\" We all make choices every single day about the quality of the foods we are consuming and it comes down to this-either we choose foods that nourish our bodies or we choose foods that damage our bodies. It's as simple as that. Once you realize the validity of this common sense fact, then making the necessary changes that Dallas and Melissa recommend in their book will be a snap. I'm gonna warn you now though: get ready to see some of the most significant physical and mental changes that you've ever experienced in your entire life. That's not sensationalized hyperbole-it's the truth! You'll just have to try it for yourself to join the ever-growing list of people who have restored their health and never looked back again.<br /><br />If you've never heard of Dallas and Melissa Hartwig before, then they provide their unique story of how they got to this point of writing a book about their work at the beginning. You'll notice that they, like many in the Paleo community, were heavily influenced by their fellow Victory Belt author Robb Wolf who gave them the idea for doing a 30-day elimination diet that has become the basis for The Whole30. And yet they've modernized Paleo to the point of removing the caveman imagery that tends to be associated with this way of eating. As they so succinctly put it, \\"we are far more concerned with health than we are on history.\\" It's not so much about mimicking the Paleolithic man as it is learning from the lessons that our hunter-gather ancestors taught us to make the best choices in the 21st Century.<br /><br />And lest you think there's no science behind this nutritional plan, you'd be sorely mistaken. Not only that, Dallas and Melissa also have a wealth of personal experience helping clients seeing them make improvements in their health that defy conventional medical wisdom. And they know that the best way to find out what works for you is by conducting your own experiments on yourself to see what happens. They also recognize that we are all different with a wide variety of physical, emotional and psychological issues to work through that aren't resolved with a cookie-cutter approach. But as the title of their book suggests, food can and should be a powerful starting point for bringing about the positive changes you are looking for no matter who you are and what your personal situation looks like.<br /><br />It's sad when you have to include a chapter in a book on nutrition defining what \\"food\\" is, but in a world where modern pseudo-food-like products such as Twinkies, Doritos and Coca-Cola are the most ubiquitous forms of edible products sold on supermarket shelves it's probably a very good idea. Dallas and Melissa explain the purpose of the various macronutrients found in good food and what role they play in being consumed. As a low-carber, I appreciated the blurb in there acknowledging that there is no dietary requirement for carbohydrates since the body can make them from the protein you consume (through a process in the liver known as gluconeogenesis). WOO HOO! Also, when they refer to fruit they make an excellent point that it \\"may promote an unhealthy psychological response\\" for people who haven't yet beaten their sugar addiction and thus should be avoided. When it comes to choosing between a Snickers bar or dried fruit and a nut bar, \\"your brain doesn't know the difference.\\" YES! They also give credence to the mistaken notion that weight management is a simple math equation of reducing your calories and fat by concluding \\"if only it were that easy.\\" AMEN!<br /><br />Major themes covered in It Starts With Food include controlling cravings, learning to recognize satiation, why we eat for pleasure, how stress negatively impacts the body, why eating for you hormones is most important (with some pretty remarkable examples of what a typical good and bad hormonal day actually looks like), the role your gut plays in being healthy, why it is critical to reduce systemic silent inflammation in the body, beating your genetic tendencies towards poor health outcomes, why eliminating sweeteners will make life so much sweeter for you, how alcohol is a worthless substance to your body, reducing the megadoses of omega-6 fats in your body by dropping the seed oils, chunking the grains (even the whole grains!) and legumes because of their woeful nutritional value, doing your due diligence about whether dairy is a problematic food category for you or not, being aware of the symptoms associated with autoimmune diseases, and navigating through the maze of food choices out there to find the best possible foods to feed yourself well with the right meats, veggies, fats (yes, the right kind of fats like animal-based and tropical ones are VERY good for you!), and creating homemade meals your whole family will love and enjoy! This book is quite dense with information, but it's written in an engaging and oftentimes hilarious manner that you'll forget how much you're learning in the midst of all the fun!<br /><br />Of course, what would the book be without getting into the nitty gritty of The Whole30 program which is what Dallas and Melissa provide towards the end of the book. Once they've laid the groundwork for why you should be following the edicts of their nutritional teachings, it's on to the plan itself. And lest you're wondering if you'll try this for a few days and decide to give up on it like every other health plan you've ever tried before, don't even think about it. This is hard-core, life-changing stuff that demands your full attention for 30 full days without even a smidge of cheating, fudging with the details or making up excuses for why you didn't do it. This is your welcome-to-the-real-world reality check and time to see just how serious you are about your health. When you realize \\"it's just 30 days\\" and give it a real go, then you can see just how much The Whole30 can help you overcome a chronic health issue that has perhaps plagued you for far too many years. You won't know unless you try and the plan is outlined for you clearly in black and white with full details on exactly what to do, how to do it, what to expect during the various phases of the 30 days, and evaluating whether you should make it a Whole45 or Whole60 to experience the best results for you(remember that self-experimentation stuff they discuss earlier in the book?). Dallas and Melissa don't coddle you through this because they assume you are all grown adults who can make choices for yourself and dig deep to make this happen. The payoff at the end of this process will make any pain along the way totally worth it!<br /><br />Once you've completed your Whole30, instructions on how to reintroduce foods one at a time are included along with some strategies about trying to maintain the progress you have made over the long-term. They acknowledge the difficulty it can be trying to live this way in everyday life and that the goal of the program isn't perfection but a compass for making the best choices about how you eat. Building sustainable habits that will stick with you for life is what it's all about. There will be meals or even whole days when you get off of your Whole30 plan but that doesn't mean you've failed. You pick yourself up and get right back at it again confidently knowing what you need to do to continue the success you've already accomplish. Be the example for your friends and family to follow by doing your part to stay true to the principles you've learned in this book.<br /><br />Towards the back of the book you'll find some critical information for \\"special populations\\" such as people with diabetes, autoimmune disease, IBS and IBD, food allergies, vegetarians and vegans, active individuals, pregnant and breastfeeding women, and even your kids. There's also specific information about some supplements that could help you along the way in this journey. Dallas and Melissa Hartwig are a compassionate couple who wish you nothing but the best in your own personal health journey. They believe the concepts they share in It Starts With Food will provide massive improvements in health for the vast majority of people, but they also realize that others will have a more difficult time despite the fact they are 100% compliant with the plan. Looking at every area of your life beyond food like sleep, exercise, stress and more will put you one step closer to finding the answers for yourself. It's a journey to the finish line no matter where you are in this race to health and Dallas and Melissa Hartwig have given you all the tools you need to make it happy. Now it's up to you.

B00634GHJA|5.0|Works as advertised. Saves looking for a cable to connect it. I have recommended it to several friends as a needed app for there phone.
0345803485|5.0|I would like to say, I started reading this book because of friends reviews. I began and was a little intimidated by the sexual parts, but the story line is so good and it keeps you reading it. I found myself in the middle of the book and getting more addicted to reading it. Rooting for Ana and Christian to make it, for her to somehow help Christian out of his past, so that they can make a future together. I am almost done with book one and praying the other two books come in the mail today!!!!<br />Its worth reading, very entertaining and addictive. Just make sure you have the other two, because you will want to keep reading.......... wow!
B005LAIHY0|5.0|I myself found the story and visuals to be breath taking. Ridley Scott's return to the franchise he started was a very much needed boost and he finally delivered a proper prequel to the series. Hopefully the planned sequel will be just as elegant.

B007Z9RAX4|2.0|Ms. UFC needs to stick to UFC. She's a HORRIBLE actress from the first 5 minutes and throughout the movie.  The action sequences are simple, and the movie overall has a low-budget appearance.<br /><br />I love action movies, sometimes I love cheap cheesy action movies, but this one was a drag through and through. The plot is easily guessed, and barely moves you along from one mediocre action sequence to the next.<br /><br />Save your time and effort and go for something else. Actually, almost anything else : /
B0086700CM|5.0|I think that temple run is a wonderful game.I also think that the graphics aren't that bad but overall its an awesome game
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|lots of fun. lots of detail. cool and cartoony with funky western music. don't care for the social aspect and it really pushes you to share you're achievements on fb. kind of annoying and wonder what I'm missing when not spending any real money.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|I have 3 girls 4, 7, 25 and a son 21.  I purchased the Blu-ray for a family movie night.  Everyone enjoyed the featured film.  It may not be exactly like to comic book but movies seldom are.  The bottom line is it was a good film that the whole family could sit down and watch together which is rare in today's market.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I have to say I absolutely loved this book. The plot was very unique and intriguing. The use of real vintage photography throughout the book was so neat and I loved it to pieces. It may have had a few flaws, it almost seemed like it took a while to get started but it covered information that was crucial to the rest of the book. The end was sort of a cliff hanger, the book could have ended there without a sequel and still be okay. I really hope that there is another book, I will jump right into it.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is so addicting!!!!! you cant stop playing it!!the game could use an end buy other than that i have no critisisms.

B007PVHBHC|5.0|As one of the few true artists of our time, Patti Smith stands tall for the purity of art as a form, as<br />  an expression of the inner self that has digested, interpreted, and then shared the character of<br />  surrounding world.  On her eleventh studio album since 1975, Smith soldiers on in her usual<br />  unassuming style as rock `n' roll poet extraordinaire.  Her lyrics, as always, are gripping &<br />  insightful; her delivery poignant & affective, carrying the wisdom of age and experience.  The<br />  music is smooth and professional, but not without its experimental moments.  The feel is less<br />  raw, but no less passionate than her early years.  \\"Banga\\" is another quietly powerful gift of<br />  earthly magic from a woman who has lived & performed with a talent & honesty that many of us<br />  spend our lives searching for.  Includes guest spots from Tom Verlaine & Johnny Depp, plus a<br />  Neil Young cover.  This is time well spent.
B000001GQP|1.0|The performance might be wonderful, but the recording seems sonically challenged.  The dynamics and range just seems thin.  I was just expecting such a huge spectacle to produce a huge rich sound.  But maybe I'm too corrupted by rock music.
B007R6X9IK|5.0|4th release from U.K. duo who have paired themselves with a number of outstanding vocalists<br />  (Mark Lanegan, Will Oldham, Jason Pierce, Richard Hawley, Mike Patton, Gibby Haynes) over<br />  the first three albums.  This time it's Depeche Mode singer Dave Gahan taking the lead.  These<br />  are big, epic, sweeping stadium ballads that soar to the heart of the sky; riding on bluesy,<br />  cinematic keyboards, orchestral strings, gospel choruses, and the depth & power of Gahan's<br />  voice.  Reminds of the Dears, Shearwater, Mark Lanegan Band, Spiritualized.

B005LAIH3G|5.0|I liked it.  There, I said it. I grew up with ERB's Tarzan and the John Carter series.  With today's special effects finally ERB's Mars can come to life.  And come to life it did.  All the characters were there.  The storyline hewed closely to the books.  It isn't the cinematic equivalent of War andPeace, but I honestly don't know why it was so poorly received.  My wife found it better than Avatar if that means anything.

It doesn't get much better than this story that is told by Nick and Amy. I had a love-hate relationship with them both! I never knew what was going to happen next and had a hard time putting it down. I hated to see it end! The writing is superb! I think this would make a fantastic movie and loved this book! Don't let GONE GIRL pass you by, believe the hype!

B007I2BZIE|4.0|Dig on this album if you're super excited about the fact that Rush has given us a proper concept album 40 years into their career and are back to recording 7+ minute songs, but for my money, all that stuff is really just  \\"buzz\\" that's been attached to this album's release.  If the concept and songs are weak, what does it really matter?  The good news is - _Clockwork Angels_ is another tremendous album from Rush since they \\"returned\\" in 2002 with [[ASIN:B000065DTE Vapor Trails]].  More so than that album and it's more-than-worthy follow up ([[ASIN:B000NVIXFK Snakes & Arrows]]), _Clockwork Angels_ is a sprawling, ambitious, challenging work of a band that has truly continued to learn how to improve their craft.  Impossible to fully digest after one or two listens, the chunky riff rock of \\"Caravan,\\" \\"BU2B\\" and \\"Headlong Flight\\" will certainly have longtime fans pleased that Rush is still at the top of their game, but it's the more subtle things about this album that really stick out in my mind as being its biggest achievements.<br /><br />With _Vapor Trails_ and _Snakes & Arrows_, Rush seemed to be on an unflappable mission to simply rock as hard as they could--and they certainly delivered.  As a big fan of both of those albums, the one consistent critique I had was that because of this, there weren't a lot of dynamics to the proceedings.  With ¬_Clockwork Angels_ being a concept album (no real groundbreaking story to this tale of a loner yearning for a larger life, but interesting nonetheless), the production is very well thought out and the flow of the album is pretty much impeccable.  Strings, keyboards, and synthesizers are really put to good use fleshing out the songs and taking the lead when appropriate.  It's a more dynamic album than _VT_ and _S&A_, with the group finally giving some breathing room to songs which has been missing for a while.  The group references their past on songs like \\"Headlong Flight\\" (\\"Bastille Day\\") and \\"The Anarchist\\" (late 70s/early80s Rush with Lifeson's flanged guitar leads around the one minute mark), yet there's a lot of new territory being explored including middle-eastern flourishes (\\"The Anarchist\\"), the almost REM-like feel of the pre-choruses to \\"Wish Them Well,\\" and the beautiful album closer \\"The Garden,\\" which I think even the most passionate Rush hater would find hard not to praise.  A critique of Rush over the past ten years has often been about Geddy Lee's vocals - that they were being doubled too often, were coming off over processed, and that he had run out of memorable melodies.  I can respect that opinion because it's somewhat valid as Rush on their last couple of albums were definitely sticking to a hard rock, riff-heavy approach which didn't necessarily lend itself to being combined with interesting melodies.  And there's still some of that on _Clockwork Angels_, but at the same time, this is probably their most melodic group of songs since the early 90s, and they seem to have reigned in the doubling of vocals for the most part to give a more earthy, natural feel to things.  \\"The Garden\\" in particular features a pretty breathtaking vocal performance from Lee.  I'm glad that there are songs like \\"Halo Effect\\" and \\"The Garden\\" on this album, as it seems that lately, Rush didn't want to slow/quiet down for one minute - everything was very in-your-face riff-heavy rock.  That is all still here--and in spades--but it's nice that they've done some songs that those fans of late 80s/early 90s Rush have probably missed for quite some time.  At the same time, there's more jamming and musical interplay in these songs than in maybe any other Rush album, certainly more than any in the last 30 years.  The opening of \\"Seven Cities of Gold\\" makes you think it's perhaps \\"Cyngus X-1...Part III\\" - just really powerful, heavy stuff before a really cool shift takes place and it transforms into a 70s bluesy hard rock song that wouldn't have been out of place with the songs they chose to cover on[[ASIN:B00028HBIY Feedback]].  As far as the musical performances go - this is Rush - at this point, you're not going to be disappointed in the drum, guitar, or bass playing.  Lifeson in particular is ferocious throughout, and Geddy's bass playing is smack dab in the forefront.<br /><br />I've been a fan of Rush since [[ASIN:B0002NRQTS Presto]] and love all of their albums for the most part (except the slight fumble of [[ASIN:B0002NRQUW Test for Echo]]), and I think the overall feeling I take away from this album is how confident and commanding Rush sounds even as they step outside of their comfort zone in many respects.  It really is a remarkable sign of a still-evolving creative unit.
B007I2BZIE|4.0|Good news and bad news. First the good news: The music is great. Absolutely astounding at times and is a lot to take in with just one listen. Rush does a lot of new and innovative playing on this album. Now the Bad news: The melodies of the vocals gets monotonous. Almost as if Geddy's singing the same song over and over again. Nothing very memorable here. I also get the feeling that I heard a lot of these vocal melodies before over the last 5 Rush albums. Additional good news: Some of the best guitar soloing I ever heard Alex play. Certainly worth a listen.

0525423656|4.0|What would you do for someone you love? Cassia Reyes is about to find out in Crossed, the sequel to Matched, by Ally Condie. The first book left off with Cassia being sent to a work field on the outskirts of her province. She's hoping to hear word of Ky's whereabouts and if he's still alive. No matter the risk - her family, Xander, or her own well-being - she is determined to find him. Her quest begins as the work camp she's in is taking some of the girls from her camp to another assignment. Cassia can only assume that it's a dangerous job in the outer provinces since they're only calling up Aberrations. In an act of desperation to find Ky, she sneaks into the transport and masquerades as an Aberration herself. Cassia finds herself in an abandoned village of boys and girls, posing as fake citizens, and drawing the fire of the enemy. It's a death sentence, and Cassia need to escape, not only to find Ky, but to save herself.    Unlike Matched which is written exclusively from Cassia's point of view, in Crossed we get alternating chapters between Cassia and Ky. As the two are separated, I can see how it was a necessity in order for the reader to keep up with both characters simultaneously. But out of that necessity came a great insight in to Ky's character. I really enjoyed experiencing the story from his point of view and having access to his thoughts really gave great insight into his character. Ky's memories of growing up in the outer provinces, the memories of his parents and how they died, and his knowledge of the rebellion gives the reader a great insight into what it's really like to be part of the rebellion movement - such a great contrast to Cassia's idealistic and somewhat naive idea of what the rebellion embodies.    While I viewed Matched as a story of falling in love, finding out, and realizing the power of your own ability to create, I felt Crossed was more about growing up, losing some innocence, and finding out how the world and the people in it aren'treally divided up into all good and all bad. Along with this transition into maturity, I thought the author did a great job of making the relationships within the book more and more complex. I really enjoyed the relationship that evolved between Cassia and a friend that she makes in the work camp named Indie. Indie is such a great character that simultaneously embodies strength and fragility, and she also manages to balance on a fine line of moral ambiguity. I loved the dynamic she brought to the story. Even without having much of a physical presence in either this novel or in Matched, Xander has a way of staying very much in the forefront of most of the characters' thoughts. It's a well crafted character that can carve out such a role without actually being included in many of the scenes of the book.    I highly recommend Crossed. I had a hard time putting it down at night as it seemed every chapter left me with some kind of cliff hanger, and I was absolutely dying to know what happened next. Just as in Matched, the language is lyrical (the descriptions often times poetry themselves), the author's writing style is intriguing, the plot is gripping and voices of the novel are very compelling. A must read for dystopian fiction lovers.    For more book reviews, check out my blog at [...]
030758836X|5.0|Gillian Flynn is maturing as a writer, and this book is proof. I would have been happy had she kept going with the nauseatingly violent mysteries, but this novel is so much more sophisticated and is by far her best! There is much to discuss here, from gender imbalances and assumptions about relationships, especially marriage, to self-mythologizing. I noticed one 1-star reviewer complaining that this was \\"poor writing\\" -- I'd love to see a single example?? Yes, there is swearing and sexual language -- but this writing is finely, carefully crafted. She doesn't make a single misstep, not in plot, nor style, nor grammar. Most of the low reviews also say that the ending is abrupt and/or disappointing. Again, I have to disagree.  Without giving anything away, the resolution reminded me of the films \\"Secretary\\" and \\"May\\".  In a Frankenstein-esque fashion, Flynn plays with the idea that in our relationships, we create (or re-create) each other as much as we do ourselves - some people's demented is other people's delight (apparently this applies not just to relationships but to the book itself).
B007IXWKUK|3.0|The ending of the previous book begs the reader to continue with this series.  After breaking up with Christian, I wondered how the next book would progress.  And, even without the major BDSM, it was still rather steamy.<br /><br />My issues with the book involve Ana's constant issues with her self-esteem and self-worth.  It is already enough to deal with Christian's self-loathing and hatred, adding her issues to the mix make almost turns the book into a huge pity party.  Further, Ana continuing to push the issue of Christian's 15 and Mrs. Robinson got on my nerves.  Isn't it enough that he was willing to give up his lifestyle in order to keep her?<br /><br />I wish the author would have drawn the issues with Lela out a little longer.  I felt she really could have went somewhere with it, but just ended it because she wanted more sex.  Since she broke into Ana's apartment with a gun, I wanted the author to push further into the whole situation.  Also, it was wrapped up too nicely for my liking.  However, I did find it rather interesting the little things she dropped that Lela probably did in order to further disrupt the budding relationship: leaving the pictures out, the jacket hanging in Ana's room at her apartment, etc.  I do have to wonder, how did Lela get the combination to Christian's safe?  That made little to no sense to me.<br /><br />Ana's promotion was more proof that this series is written by a 16 year-old!  Having no previous experience with publication--aside from her disastrous interview with Christian in the first book--it made absolutely no sense that she would end up the damn editor of the publishing company!  I graduated with an a B.A. in English with an amazing GPA, worked several years in the publications, etc., and I couldn't even HOPE to land that kind of position!  In addition, the author mentions that one of the reasons for her promotion was due to her contact with Jack's authors.  Well, duh, she was his personal assistant!  Even though she had only been with the company for 1.5 weeks, it stands to reason that she would have contact with his authors.  Also, it was extremely unbelievable that, having NO EXPERIENCE, she was able to push the company to pick up a couple of books for possible publication in ONE DAY!<br /><br />The explanation behind Charlie-Tango's malfunctions was also another sign that certain plot elements were not thought out.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|2012's Clockwork Angels is the new concept album from the legendary Canadian band Rush. It is the band's nineteenth studio album of original material (twentieth if you count the covers album Feedback) and follows up their last two albums in bringing out the more Hard Rock/Metal aspects of their sound. It takes Snakes And Arrows' variety and Vapor Trails' power and combines them into a very strong album indeed, one that isn't ever dull or plodding. The story that it tells is also available separately as a novel.<br /><br />If you have already heard `Caravan' and `BU2B,' which were released a full two years earlier than the record was, then you should have some idea of this album's musical direction already. The songs have since been re-recorded to fit in better with the rest of the album though, so even if you've played them to death already, you won't feel cheated that they are part of the album.<br /><br />Despite concentrating on the band's heavier side, the album is still very dynamic and varied. Sometimes things will be melodic and sweet, sometimes there are synths and keys in there, sometimes you'll hear little touches that remind you of Hemispheres and A Farewell To Kings and then of course sometimes you'll hear more of the direction from Snakes And Arrows' and Vapor Trails' heavier moments. The opening to `Carnies' even has a big fat riff that could almost fit on a Monster Magnet or Down album.<br /><br />Each song on Clockwork Angels contains a lot of different parts; you could hear a funk-like break down in one track, an acoustic intro in another, some proggy feedback scrapes in another and straight rock beats in yet another, or you could hear all of that and more within one single track.<br /><br />Highlights include the closing track `The Garden' which opens with acoustic guitars and has a grand orchestral feel in places, as well as the amazing single `Headlong Flight', which mixes variety with focused hard rocking (similar in a way to `Far Cry' off the last album but with more parts packed into it) and the fun track `The Anarchist' that really takes off in a neat passage that revolves around tom-rolling.<br /><br />As a general rule, I always find that the best Rush songs are the ones where a lot of time has passed without you knowing it, for example a five-minute track that feels like it is only two-and-a-half minutes long; and the worst ones were the ones where a lot of time passes without enough ideas used to justify the song lasting as long as it actually does, for example a six-minute track that could have worked a lot better as a three minute song.<br /><br />The best thing about the whole Clockwork Angels album for me personally, is that every song justifies its own length. When this plus is added to the superb musical direction (I prefer the band's heavier side personally), the superb production and the as-always superb musical and vocal talent on display, it makes for an absolutely captivating record that hits hard on first listen and has a lot more to offer on subsequent spins as well.<br /><br />Then on top of that, you have the interesting steam-punk story to get to grips with across each early listen, which just adds yet further intrigue and replay value. It would be tempting to say that this is almost guaranteed to be loved by any Rush fan, but then you have to consider that their audience is so wide and diverse and their catalogue is so varied that pleasing any one type of fan may cost another type of fan to loose interest.<br /><br />If you are an early-prog or synth-pop fan first, and a Rush fan second however, if you hated Vapor Trails and the heavier parts of Snakes And Arrows and are generally the type of person who hates all Metal, then Clockwork Angels may not be for you. I can see how it may be leaning a little heavily on one aspect of their sound and that maybe that's the one part of Rush's style that you don't personally enjoy. Maybe even the conceptual nature of the record or the variety within each track isn't enough to save it for you, if you simply don't like Rush when they get all loud and distorted. If this describes you, then my advice would be that maybe you ought to give this one a miss.<br /><br />Otherwise however, this is a pretty essential album and no matter the size of your Rush collection, this should probably be a part of it.<br /><br />In summary; Clockwork Angels is a strong and fresh album, it is energetic, entertaining and focused, it is heavy rather often and has enough ideas per song to justify each song's length. It just sounds vital and has enough depth to reward repeat listens. Overall, its a pretty top-notch release and it's definitely something you should consider getting if you like Rush, especially if you like their heavier side.ithin each track isn't enough to save it for you, if you simply don't like Rush when they get all loud and distorted.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|A new Rush release. It's like christmas morning. It has been 5 years since we have been able to sink our teeth into some new material. The band basically teased us two years ago in releasing Caravan and BU2B in time for their epic Time Machine tour. Those two songs were immediate rockers, filled with great riffs, cool lyrics and a taste of what was to come in Rush's first \\"true\\" start to finish concept record.<br /><br />I had no idea what to expect to be honest. What was this story of steam punk and alchemy going to be about?<br /><br />Headlong Flight is then released and things start to come into focus. A daring journey, piracy, adventures in the air and on the high seas. A life filled with adventure, peril and as we find out with the rest of the album romance and reflection.<br /><br />Opening my fan pack last week was truly special. A great package that included a fact filled magazine dedicated to the new release, back stories on the making of the record, and a neat look back at every Rush album with commentary from current musicians (like Steve Wilson and Taylor Hawkins), friends, authors and former producers. The introduction in the magazine (or shall I say fanzine) was penned by Taylor Hawkins and it is a very heartwarming way to start it all off.<br /><br />Then of course the CD itself is packaged in a wonderful, classy album like jacket complete with visual treats (lot's of great pictures) and the narration of this journey of a boy turning into adventurer, into a wise old man.<br /><br />Sitting and reading the narration before each song took me back to age 14 when I first experienced 2112. Opening that gatefold jacket and reading the story of the priests etc. I had a huge smile on my face as I read through Clockwork Angels before each song.<br /><br />Neil is letting his imagination run wild again. After going through the tragedy he went through (which you never truly get over) it is so wonderful and refreshing seeing an artist at work again, writing about living, and having grand adventures. I have missed this so much in Rush's music for a long time.<br /><br />So on to the album.<br /><br />Caravan - \\"I can't stop thinking big\\" - The newly mixed version has some surprises. A more up front keyboard flourish, some phased guitars and bass. I like it. I prefer Neil's drums in the \\"single mix\\" however. But again a great Rush song to kick off this journey to Crown City.<br /><br />BU2B - \\" The Price of what we're wining is the same as what we've lost\\" - I love the new intro. It totally changes up the feel of how the song kicks in and gives it some drama. We find out all about the Watchmaker, and how people in this futuristic world of streamliners, flint and steel are programed what to believe and how to live. I love this song, always have since it was released. A straight ahead rocker with a great turn at the bridge.<br /><br />Clockwork Angels - \\"Goddesses of Light, of sea and sky and land\\" - I was blown away on the first listen and it has only become better and better with each listen. Rush has written an epic song again. The song has a beautiful intro of grandiose quality. A wall of Alex with Geddy holding down the bottom end and then....glass hitting water for the verse. Gorgeous. Lot's of changes, twists and turns that all come together after repeated listens. The song is daring. The bridge after the fantastic Alex solo is really something. I visualize walking through Chronos Square hearing loudspeakers blaring propaganda \\"Everything will turn out for the best\\" A brilliant passage in the song that give the sense of living in a controlled world. A Blade Runner moment if you will.<br /><br />The Anarchist - \\"A missing part of me that grows around me like a cage\\" - Here we go....another Rush rocker and our introduction to the boy becoming a man and going off on his adventures in this twisted world Neil has written for us to explore. The chorus of this song is fantastic. Alex growls everywhere on this song. We find theprotagonist wandering the streets of Chronos Square observing the masses conforming and he refusing to believe that this is the way to live. I love the 80's Grace Under pressure like feel of this song. Alex's solo is straight out of 1984! Also their is a middle eastern flavor on one section of this tune that is undeniable and really dramatic.<br /><br />Carnies - \\"The Glint of Iron Wheels\\" \\"The Smell of flint and steel\\" - Our hero joins the circus, falls in love, and is called out as a outsider not conforming to this order. The song is a full on rocker with again Rush taking us in a totally different direction after the first verse. He latches on to this group of carnies to get away and begin his journey but is driven out. I love this song. Lot's of Vaportrail like musings in the verses, but sonically much better.<br /><br />Halo Effect - \\"A Goddess with wings on her heals\\" - Crushed, his heart stomped on by what he tries to envision as his soul mate. A nice breather from the onslaught we have heard up to this point. Halo effect is placed perfectly in the flow of this album. I like it. A very easy song to get into. Accessible and clean. Short and to the point. Wonderful guitar work and a great vocal performance from Geddy.<br /><br />Seven Cities of Gold - \\" A Man can lose his past in a country like this\\" - This is another bombastic riff driven Rush epic. I feel this is one of the highlights of the album. A visual feast of our hero's journey into a snow filled desert. The jamming in this song harkens back to the 70's style of Rush big time. One of the albums most organic songs. A true power trio rocker and Alex again shines on his solo section, half stepping into space as well. The main riff here is destined to become a classic Rush jam.<br /><br />The Wreckers - All I know is that sometimes you have to be wary\\" - The Wreckers brings us what may be one of Rush's finest songs ever. That's right. I can't tell you how much I love this song. Not only is the chorus oneof the most melodic ones the band has ever written, the verse music is just delicious! Tell me you can't smell the salty air and feel the wind blowing through the sails as this ship our hero boarded at the port of Poseidon plunges into certain death. A unique gem among many diamonds. This is a song for the ages.<br /><br />Headlong Flight - \\"Oh I wish I can live it all again!\\" - I already really liked this tune, but as I expected once I heard it in the context of the complete concept.....I now love this song. A Rush tour de force in every way. Riffage everywhere, a rousing chorus, a amazing bridge and solo section takes the song into the stratosphere! The entire journey we have been through all comes to a head sort of speak. It feels the like a finale but only for the adventure....the growth and wisdom of our hero will be later reveled.<br /><br />BU2B2 - A little passage, connecting us to the last part of the album. His optimism fading, he keeps moving forward, living and learning to.......<br /><br />Wish Them Well - \\"Just keep on going let the demons dwell\\" - This was a song that took me 4 listens to really get into....but now I appreciate it for the rocker it is. It reminds me of Carve Way The Stone a lot. I love it's premise and that is what got me to \\"get it\\" over repeated listens. It is a lesson I also apply to my own life. Any relationship that becomes toxic...I just wish them well and walk away.<br /><br />The Garden - \\"The Measure of a life is a measure of love and respect\\" - The Garden is such a wonderful piece. Rush always manages to put a tune on every album that just shocks you. A song that you would never expect from them. The Garden is that song. Just brilliant, heartfelt, and real. This may be one of Neil's finest compositions. It is a song of hope, love and understanding of what life really is about. Tend to your garden.<br /><br />I am floored by Clockwork Angels. Really. Much more profound than Snakes and Arrows which IMO is a strong album as well. But this new record we see Rush taking chances again. Throwing out the standard song writing structure and going for it again. Jams are all over this album, visual beauty, thought provoking fantasy.<br /><br />Rush has me geeked up all over again. Something that has not happened since Grace Under Pressure. Power Windows and Hold Your Fire were amazing albums but dealt with real world issues, and adult topics and so it would stay that course for the next decade or so. Gone were songs about androids and fear. Gone were tunes about racing a car on the weekend, or marching with the mob to hang witches, or seeing the sun rays break through the clouds as the thunder head roared in the distance.<br /><br />Rush had moved forward. And I moved with them as well. I have enjoyed that ride oh so much the past 25 plus years.<br /><br />But here we find the band reaching back. Finding that reckless abandon in the song writing, the lyrics, the playing and letting your imagination run wild with them as they take you on a true journey through a world of mystery, piracy, and adventure.<br /><br />Thank you again for making me feel 14 years old again if only for a fleeting moment in time.

034580404X|4.0|I didn't read any of the reviews before reading this series (recommended by my son's wife). A friend told me she read some of the reviews and that the book was written by a fan of the Twilight series (which I liked) and that the author of 50 wrote her book based on Stephenie Meyer's books. Forewarned, I watched for similarities and saw a few, but the events in 50 were so different from the Twilight's that they didn't distract from the story.<br />I have heard there is a review listing all the similarities; some so obscure that unless you actually scanned both novels you would not find them (who all knows the birthdays of Bella and Edward? Not me and I've read all the books and seen the movies multiple times). Also pointed out was the use of the word murmur, which is reported to be over 100 times. Maybe so, but it didn't stand out since I was reading the story for pleasure, not as a research project. It was also reported to be written in an immature fashion; I found it an easy read, not immature.<br />All in all, I found the novels interesting enough that I finished them in less than a week. I did notice a few things I found annoying: Ana always comes on demand; she calls her adoptive father her step-father (not true, two totally different references); the author throws in pretentious words where they're not necessary; plus, the ending felt rushed.<br />I'd recommend this book to both women and men; although, men beware, it is a romance.

B007KCG7MQ|4.0|I always look back to that gem of a gem of an album, ROCKPILE, that Lynne co-produced around 1979. Somebody..either at the control panel or on the studio floor (when there *was* studio floors) and said, y'know, let's use a steady 4/4 beat.<br /><br />And that's what we hear on \\"But I Try\\", a 13 minute jam cut down to about 6.5, most likely improvized on the spot by Little Richard, on top of his game, in his Comeback Era (1971). (Joe, thank for keeping that decaying banker's box o' tapes away from sunlight).<br /><br />A little-known, though current, Chuck Berry song made it onto that vaunted album way back when...these guys know how to bring the eras all together..now.<br /><br />But let's jump 22 years..and find another icon in the new mix. Check out Ringo on a great Walsh composition, herein. (Jeff got Richard and Ringo together for the best \\"Good Golly, Miss Molly\\" recut, ever, in 1991).<br /><br />What a meeting of the minds! Two of the greatest musical-era integrationists, Walsh and Lynne, delivering the best of the Rock and Roll to Rock era. In a solid Joe Walsh effort. The title tune itself should bring enough creative counterpoint to the current digital standstill.<br /><br />Would have liked to have the lead vocals a taste more upfront...but, baby, that is Rock and Roll.<br /><br />Accompanying media...mahvalous.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|I had seen the previews and trailers a long time ago and decided when it came out I would add it to my collection. It came in and I watched it with great interest and found it to be a stirring memorial to all of the young lives lost protecting our country. What a responsibility we have to not let their memory down by failing to fulfill our duties as citizens of the country so many made the ultimate sacrifice to protect and defend.<br /><br />Let each of us stand up and be counted as we are able in the defense of this country and in support of the principles for which it stands and for which so many have died.<br /><br />The movie is powerful and has some graphic moments; I recommend it for mature audiences.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|Beyond a shadow of a doubt, certain Beatles songs do sound better in mono. All songs on \\"Please Please Me\\" and \\"With The Beatles\\" are infinitely better in mono as well as all other non-album material released in 1962 and 1963 on the \\"Masters\\" sets. The arguments for mono vs. stereo really start with material recorded from 1964 to 1967. It starts with the 4 tracks that were originally released on the British EP \\"Long Tall Sally\\". The song \\"Slowdown\\" is mixed very poorly on the stereo release. It lacks any bass sound whatsoever. The mono version is far more powerful and really rocks. On the \\"Hard Day's Night\\" album, the mono apparently received the minor repairs and edits to correct notable flaws; the harmonica intro on \\"I Should Have Known Better\\" and McCartney's vocal breakdown, on \\"If I Fell\\". The stereo versions of these are unrepaired which shows that mono was given priority. With respect to \\"Beatles For Sale\\", according to Mark Lewisohn's book about the Beatles recording sessions, the stereo mixes for several of the 14 songs were completed in about 30 minutes! Despite this, they still sound very good. The mono mixes were given much more time, attention, and care. As for \\"Help!\\" and \\"Rubber Soul\\", the original 1965 stereo mixes, in many cases were very \\"ping-pong\\". This was especially true for \\"Rubber Soul\\" with the vocals mixed to the far right in the stereo picture. When \\"Help!\\" and \\"Rubber Soul\\" were first released on CD in 1987, Beatles producer George Martin remixed these two albums. \\"Help!\\" sounds awesome in stereo. \\"Rubber Soul is marginally better but the vocals still pan somewhat to the right of center in the stereo picture, which still leaves me unsettled. Mono gets the thumbs up on this one. With \\"Revolver\\" and \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" come the biggest debates. On \\"Revolver\\" the recording technique which came to be known as artificial double tracking, known commonly as ADT, was invented and the Beatles used it liberally when they recorded the vocals for this album. The stereo mix shows these off beautifully. The mono mix however does benefit from longer fades for a few songs and a few flaws present on the stereo mix are not present. The Beatles themselves have all said that the only true \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" release is the mono version. They were present for all mono mixes and they were completely absent when it came time to mix the album for stereo. For \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" and \\"The Beatles\\" aka \\"The White Album\\", the stereo mixes do get the nod as sounding more pleasing to the ear, but it is fun to find the differences between the mixes. One exception in this period is the single version of \\"Revolution\\" on the \\"Masters\\". John Lennon was quoted as saying in an interview that the stereo version was 'turned into a piece of ice cream'. The mono version does have more punch, for sure. If you are forced to choose between the two, get the mono and buy \\"Abbey Road\\", and \\"Let It Be\\" separately since they are not included in the Mono box since they only exist in stereo.
B007TBCTRK|5.0|OK, it's not Alien or Aliens, but that aside I actually really like this soundtrack. One of the first things I listen for in evaluating a soundtrack is whether there's a memorable theme. I found the beginning theme in Prometheus quite memorable. I apologize as I'm not an expert in music so I can't describe the notes, but you'll recognize a distinctive theme pretty early on.<br /><br /> The theme used throughout the soundtrack and is rearranged slightly to convey different moods. Personally, having just seen the movie, I thought it adds a lot to the film. There aren't as many dark or scary themes, but then again Promtheus isn't really a horror movie like Alien. Rather, the music is haunting and conveys a sense of discovery gone wrong.<br /><br />While Prometheus the movie IS kind of a prequel to Alien (despite what Ridley Scott says), the music IS NOT. The soundtrack doesn't even have the same DNA as the Alien or Aliens music. However, as I said, I love it and think in terms of quality it's one of the better new movie soundtracks I've heard in recent years. I'd recommend watching the movie first to see if you like the soundtrack.
B007BVOF8E|3.0|The four low rating reviews remark that this is a slow and boring film.  I must say that they clearly have never read the book or seen the original BBC miniseries.  John le Carre does not write spy fiction with a view to action, but only fiction that reflects the reality of the spy world.<br /><br />With that being said, this movie does suffer a pretty big flaw.  While the acting and directing was good, the storytelling this movie employed left something to be desired.  I'm not complaining about any changes made.  They fit what filled a 6 hour miniseries into a movie just over 2 hours long.  What I did not like was the pacing and the failure of proper application of showing and telling plot details.<br /><br />With regards to the pacing, the film keeps an even pace throughout.  It fails to actually build tension and drama by not making clear what is at stake.  The setup at the beginning of the movie and the ordering of some scenes reduces the overall building of tension.  Likewise, with such an ensemble cast, few characters are effectively established.  This results in a film which just fails to draw the viewers interest.<br /><br />When to show and when to tell is very important in storytelling.  It is even more important when moving a book into a film while trying to keep the source material intact.  This movie does not do a particularly good job of that, particularly in the first half to two-thirds.  Time is spent showing one character die in bed and another in retirement when this could be exposition.  One whole scene is spent on a fly in a car and another showing a character killing an owl that flew out of the chimney.  A party which is only mentioned in passing in the novel is given three scenes.  All of this time is wasted instead of building up Ricky Tarr's story and more clearly establishing continuity.<br /><br />In the end, this film is ok.  With great performances from Gary Oldman and Benedict Cumberbatch and good cinematography, the storytelling reallydrags down the film.  It picks up towards the end, but it is too little too late, unfortunately.<br /><br />I do highly recommend the book or the BBC miniseries for your viewing pleasure instead.

0307951529|4.0|Many entrepreneurship books are filled with the hype of success stories, when in fact, there are probably 10 business failures for every success, most or none of which receive any meaningful coverage.  According to the Small Business Administration, 50% of new businesses fail within the first 5 years, and over 2/3rd fail over 10 years.  Economic historian John V.C. Nye wrote in a 1991 article \\"Lucky Fools and Cautious Businessmen,\\" self-delusion is essential to maintaining an entrepreneurial culture.  Countries become economically stagnant when rationale and reason triumph over delusion.  The U.S. and Germany surpassed Victorian Britain because British businessmen stopped investing unwisely, despite access to efficient capital markets.<br /><br />In [[ASIN:0374275637 Thinking, Fast and Slow]] Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman cites chance as one of the key ingredients in new venture success, whereas most entrepreneurs believe their success is largely due to their effort and ingenuity.<br /><br />So it was with all of this background bias that I picked up an unpublished copy of \\"The $100 Startup\\", not expecting to see anything different than the plethora of other books on the subject.  But here's what makes Mr. Guillebeau's book different:  \\"The $100 Startup\\" is about starting a micro business to gain independence \\"that is based on something you love to do - in other words, something intrinsically related to the owner's skill or passion.\\"  If you're after the kind of money that will get you a Lamborghini Gallardo like Akon, this is not the book for you.  Temper your self-indulgence and start a business that will net you $50K-$60K a year.  Mr. Guillebeau's blueprint may set you on the path of a reasonable work-life balance, but some luck and delusion is still necessary to get the job done.

B002L4QP0M|4.0|Slow start, but when it got going, it was a classic page turner, and I couldn't put it down from about half-way through.<br /><br />However, the end left me with too many unanswered questions.  At times it was challenging to follow, so a another 4 of 5 pages of dialogue at the end to tie things up would have been much more satisfying.
B005LAIGNC|5.0|One of the most outstanding you can buy on blu-ray or DVD, Excellent movie to watch. Great acting, special effects, awesome cast.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|Make no mistake, this new Rush album is for Rush fans. Like the band itself, there is very little middle ground, listeners will either love or hate this record.<br /><br />Clockwork Angels is a modern day concept album. Like concept albums from The Who or Pink Floyd, each song is a chapter in the Clockwork Angels story, but each track stands on its own.<br /><br />Musically, the guys are playing as tight as ever. And there is a lot of playing on this album. Lyrically, Clockwork Angels is some of Neil's best writing ever, filled with steampunk imagery and emotion.<br /><br />This is highly subjective, but it is safe to say this record is as good as any Rush album since Moving Pictures. Yep.<br /><br />Track-by-Track Review<br /><br />Caravan - Released two years ago, this track has been re-mixed by co-producer Nick Rasculinecz. The re-mix is subtly different, with more bass guitar are some more sound effects.<br /><br />BU2B (Brought Up To Believe) - Already released, but with a new intro with guitar that sounds like late-era Pink Floyd. In a recent interview, Alex admitted the new intro was a last-minute add-on recorded in his hotel room during mixing. The rest of the song is as good as ever.<br /><br />Clockwork Angels - Finally, brand new material. A musically dynamic song shifting between driving rock, soft melodics and even some blues. It is reminiscent of The Way The Wind Blows from Snakes and Arrows. While it doesn't have an obvious hook, this song really grows on you after a few listens. Best song ending on the record too...<br /><br />The Anarchist - The first 1.5 minutes are a jam, with some great guitar riffs and Neil pounding away on the low toms. In fact, song initially seems like an instrumental, but finally the lyrics come in. \\"The lenses inside of me that paint the world black.\\" Alex does a very cool middle-eastern guitar solo.<br /><br />Carnies - This song begins with a killer riff that's a like demented version of \\"Working Man.\\" Some great lyricalhooks: \\"The smell of flint and steel\\" and \\"sometimes the angels punish us by answering our prayers.\\" I can hear some arpeggios that sound quite like the patented \\"Hemispheres\\" chord.<br /><br />Halo Effect - This is one for the wives and girlfriends of Rush fans. After 5 heavy songs, track 6 is a short melodic breather. And its a rare Rush relationship song with poignant lyrics everyone will be able to relate too. \\"What did I see? / Fool that I was.\\"<br /><br />Seven Cities of Gold - My favorite song after the first listen. This song is funky, heavy, and grooving. \\"A man can lose his past in a country like this.\\" It's like Rush's \\"Territories\\" mixed with Zeppelin's \\"Black Dog.\\"<br /><br />The Wreckers - This tune has the best chorus lines on the album: \\"All I know is sometimes you have to be wary of a miracle too good to be true.\\" It is accompanied by a nice string arrangement. My vote for the next single.<br /><br />Headlong Flight - Already released to radio, this is a quintessential Rush song. Geddy's opening bass riffs and Neil's drum break are real highlights. \\"I wish that I could live it all again.\\" Indeed.<br /><br />BU2B2 - This is a really brief string and guitar piece. The lyrics fit into the Clockwork story, but this is more like a connector piece than an actual song.<br /><br />Wish Them Well - If BU2B is an angst-filled faith basher, Wish Them Well is the more stoic approach of a more mature man: \\"Thank your stars you're not that way / turn your back and walk away.\\" The liner notes indicate this song was tedious to write, despite its relatively straight-ahead sound. I'm glad they didn't scrap this one.<br /><br />The Garden - Simply one of the best Rush songs ever. It opens with strings and a melodic bass part and then some acoustic guitar. This is the song that every Rush fan will want played at their funeral.  \\"The measure of a life is a measure of love and respect.\\" Alex's solo is right up there with \\"Limelight\\" and \\"Kid Gloves.\\"<br /><br />In conclusion, the listener gets the feeling these songs were made to be played live. I wouldn't be disappointed to Clockwork Angels in its entirety on forthcoming tour.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Hands down, this is the best Rush album since Moving Pictures.  I have had the album for several days prior to release and it took hold of me from the very first listen.  The musicianship and mixing is stellar as well.  Simply remarkable.

034580404X|1.0|IMO, the books are horrendous: poorly written, sophomoric, and terribly redundant. Complete waste of time and money, and way over-hyped by the media! A 13-year-old junior high school student could have done a better job writing about their \\"sex-capades\\" in their diary! This author should NEVER be allowed to publish again; she probably can't even write a decent grocery list!

1936608898|5.0|I bought Dallas & Melissa's \\"whole 9\\" starter guide online, so I was debating whether or not to get this book. I'm glad I did! The arguments for the Whole9 style of eating are well laid out and supported and the book is written in a clear and engaging manner that is very pleasant to read. Dallas and Melissa manage to present a \\"tough love\\" attitude that informs without being pushy or judgmental. As a bonus, they have a bunch of helpful recipes and menu planning ideas and a nice color section describing different recipes. I got the book two days ago and so far the one recipe that I have tried was easy to prepare and delicious.<br /><br />  This book is a must read for anyone who is interested in nutrition and how food affects the body and your life. I highly recommend it!
B006NXIDMU|4.0|I started reading the trilogy because of all the media coverage and the release of the movie. Then a friend (who never reads) said she had read the first book in one night. I had to get it. Even though its a young adult novel, at the age of 49 I found it compelling and hard to put down.Like Lord Of The Rings I found myself totally memsmerized by the world and loved the depth and bredth of characters. A must read

1936608898|5.0|Over the past couple years I've gradually changed my nutrition from a primarily grain-based diet, which was keeping me fat and sick, towards the Paleo diet. It has easily been one of the best decisions I have ever made. In the past year, I've read nearly every major Paleo book on the market (the Perfect Health Diet, Primal Blueprint, Paleo Solution, Paleo Answer, etc.) All of those books are quite good, and each has its own unique perspective. However, after reading a pre-release copy of \\"It Starts with Food\\" in just a few days (it's a real page-turner!) I realized that this is by far the best introduction to nutrition that I have ever read from both a scientific and a practical perspective. My mom recently asked me for one book she could read to describe the new nutrition plan I've been following, and I told her that \\"It Starts with Food\\" was by far the best. After she asked me that I immediately ordered a copy for her, my dad, and my brother. There are four main reasons why I think this is by far the best introduction to healthy nutrition I've ever seen:<br /><br />1) Dallas and Melissa explain how food can have a number of extremely important effects on your body that are not limited to your weight. You may be fairly skinny, but the food you eat affects far more than your weight. The food we eat directly affects our psychology, our hormones, and the way our body reacts to the outside world. For example, scientists are starting to realize that certain foods may be the cause of certain auto-immune diseases (e.g., alopecia, rheumatoid arthritis, type 2 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, etc.), and Dallas and Melissa do a great job of explaining how certain foods can cause these auto-immune diseases, which can wreak havoc on your body. Even if you're happy with your weight, food has a profound affect on a number of aspects of our health, and doing Dallas and Melissa's 30 day nutritional reset may help alleviate cravings, auto-immune symptoms, psychological issues, or evencertain hormonal imbalances. How many diets can boast those results? Most other diets are merely concerned with weight loss, without caring at all about cultivating a healthy hormonal and psychological relationship with food.<br />2) Dallas and Melissa do a fantastic job of explaining the science behind the nutrition plan. They explain exactly why grains, sugars, vegetable oils, legumes, and dairy are not healthy for us and what problems each one of those foods has. They also have fantastic analogies to explain complex scientific concepts about nutrition.<br />3) Dallas and Melissa provide the best and most practical 30 day nutrition plan for Paleo that I've ever seen. I've done their 30 day reset a couple of times myself, and I always feel fantastic after 30 days of clean eating. I'm also a coach at Crossfit South Bend (Indiana), and a number of members of our gym have done the program with fantastic results. We recently did a nutrition challenge in January. The vast majority of our members doing the program lost weight. However, a number of them said that they experienced positive benefits that went far beyond mere weight loss. A number of people said that they stopped randomly waking up in the middle of the night when they were sleeping while others said that nagging aches, pains, and allergies went away after changing their nutrition. A number of others dramatically improved their physical performance in the gym as a result of changing their nutrition. Probably the most profound result for a number of members was the realization of how addicted they had been to sugar, wheat, and dairy before changing their nutrition. The awareness of these addictions is one of the most profound effects of the Whole30.<br />4) Lastly, Dallas and Melissa's program is NOT a diet. A diet is a short term extreme restriction of calories to achieve weight loss without any concern for overall health. The nutritional plan provided in this book is a sustainable nutrition plan that does not involve caloric restriction, and it is far more concerned with your overall health and well-being rather than some number on a scale.<br /><br />If you have any interest in increasing longevity, restoring health, or improving physical performance I highly recommend this book.

B0060AY6FO|2.0|P.d. James must have realised that there would be many Austen fans eagerly awaiting this book.  It is a shame she did not choose to respect the characters Austen created.  This book is not worth the money if you are an avid jane Austen fan.  There are many many others that are worth taking the time to read.

The chemistry between Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law is the best and Jared Harris was an excellent Moriarty.<br /><br />Now, for those who've had trouble with the download thing, here's the deal...<br /><br />Step 1: Go to Flixster. Click \\"Redeem Now\\" under the 'Redeem Your UltraViolet Digital Copy' title.<br />Step 2: Scroll down and click on \\"Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows.\\"<br />Step 3: Click \\"Get Started.\\" It'll take you through setting up an account and linking it with UltraViolet.<br />Step 4: After linking the two accounts, make sure you go back to the FLIXSTER homepage (I got stuck on the UltraViolet webpages which is what threw me).<br />Step 5: Repeat Steps 1 and 2 if need be to get back to where you enter the code.<br />Step 6: You'll be directed to enter the code and download Flixster. Do so (enter the code that's on the insert), and install the Flixter program. (It can take awhile to install.)<br />Step 7: With the Flixster program installed and the code entered (through the Flixter webpage), open up the Flixster program on your computer. Your video library should have the movie listed. Click download if you want it saved on your computer.<br /><br />TA DA! Hope everyone can follow what I wrote okay. If you don't want to use the memory, you can just stream it from the Flixster library, but that requires an internet connection to watch it. Once you download it, you can watch it without internet. (I know because I tried it with my connection off and it worked, it just took a few seconds to load.)<br /><br />REMEMBER: the digital download is through FLIXSTER, the streaming to devices is through UltraViolet.

0345803485|4.0|I approached this book with trepidation. I'm really not keen on books that are surrounded by hype, where they seemingly appear from nowhere and EVERYONE is reading, as I ultimately end up disappointed. (I notoriously hated the first Harry Potter book, but I'm glad I continued reading them now.) So after reading a couple of reviews, and getting a couple of people telling me \\"You HAVE to read it\\", I bought a copy.<br /><br />Do you remember in school when people used to pass around certain books (ahem Jackie Collins!) for the certain passages those contained? Those were nothing compared to this book. Those were tame, innocent, timid compared to this book.<br /><br />I can genuinely say I was sucked straight into this book. Wow. Definitely my favourite read of 2012 so far. I loved the characters, and the mysteriousness of Christian's character. He actually strongly reminded me of guys I've known (apart from the whole BDSM bit obviously) and I could see a lot of myself in Anastasia's character. Which is probably a major reason why I loved this book.<br /><br />Yes there are issues with the writing and editing. It could have been cut down a little. But I have to be one of the few people who actually liked Ana's subconscious and inner goddess. I definitely need to give my inner goddess a good kick up of the backside. Mine certainly doesn't do cartwheels and sexy dances. The subconscious I felt was very well paired up against her inner goddess. All she needed to do was give them names!<br /><br />I loved the chemistry between Ana and Christian. Wow. Each word he spoke (wrote?) was literally dripping with innuendo. This is a really good couple with a really good story just springing from this page.<br /><br />If you haven't got an open mind, and are the slightest bit intimidated by the thought of spanking, then this isn't the book for you. Put it down, and go back to something more tame, like Catherine Cookson. This is the kind of book that will make you blush when reading on the bus (tube, whatever), partly because of the content, but also because you know everyone's looking at you, KNOWING what you're reading. You will come off the bus fanning yourself with the book. This book tells you every single detail you could possibly want to know about certain sexual acts and then some!<br /><br />I ended up finishing this book on the bus, and I was almost crying, the ending was so amazing. I had to go and buy the next two straight away, and started on Fifty Shades Darker immediately while having something to eat.<br /><br />Each to their own, this book is a bit of a hit and miss. You're either going to love it or you hate it. I really did expect myself to end up on the hating side of things, but I'm really impressed that I liked it so much. Yes, the book is not going to win any awards, but I think this is going to be a little guilty pleasure of mine, and definitely will be re-read. Every girl needs a little bit of Christian Grey in their lives.on the bus (tube, whatever), partly because of the content, but also because you know everyone's looking at you, KNOWING what you're reading.

B0086QS7N2|5.0|I'm only giving this a five star review because that's as high as the scale goes.<br /><br />It deserves more. It really does.<br /><br />I'd write a longer review, but others have already covered the detail better than I could.  What's harder to review is how this album made me feel. In terms exhilirated, delighted, moved, inspired, amused, saddened ... and ROCKED!<br /><br />Laughter. Tears. Sweat.<br /><br />It's all there. An incredible achievement.<br /><br />I paid £600 for three seats three rows back centre stage in Birmingham. I want them to play the whole thing as the first half of the show. It might even be worth it.

B00000JMOF|5.0|I watched Frankenstein and City Lights back to back as part of my quest to watch all top 100 AFI movies. It is fascinating that these two movies are both from 1931 and that they represent, in a way, a beginning and end point for two different styles of film. City Lights was a humorous Charlie Chaplin silent, and Frankenstein was a full-sound, visceral dark drama.<br /><br />Frankenstein is based on the classic Mary Shelley novel which combines a number of powerful themes. This is not simply a \\"mindless monster\\" smashing a town for no reason. Instead, there are a wealth of fairly complex threads weaving through this. Dr. Frankenstein strives to play God with a brand new person literally of his own creation. He almost had what he wanted, too, but his hapless assistant somehow managed to get a criminal brain instead of a healthy one. The result is that the created-man becomes a \\"monster\\" - barely able to walk and unable to talk. But clearly the poor thing can feel. He does his best to lumber around and follow commands, but is tormented by the assistant. He shows kindness and pleasure with a little girl, but inadvertently drowns her. There is a great deal of power and pathos in the acting, in how he tries his best and life just does not treat him well.<br /><br />And how about Dr. Frankenstein? He was a promising student but nobody understood his lofty goals. He feels exiled from society and misunderstood. He can't even confide in his bride-to-be. And after all of that, when he finally is about to prove how right he was, his assistant makes a mess of everything.<br /><br />Many movies from the late 20s / early 30s feel dated now, when watched, but Frankenstein still holds its own, earning its #87 spot on the AFI top 100 list. The scenery is dark and moody. So many lines of dialogue here are now classics, embedded into our modern culture. Even scenes from the movie are now \\"stereotypes\\" that so many other films have used.<br /><br />It's funny how cultural expectations can change over time, though. Every time I see the scene of the father leaving his tiny child all alone at the house - by a pond!! - I cringe. I could not imagine doing that with my own child. Maybe for people in 1931 that was a quite normal thing to do.<br /><br />Interestingly, although written by a woman, the movie is definitely a story that focuses on men. We have the brilliant single-minded Doctor. His best friend who thinks it is OK to try to seduce away his wife-to-be. The wise professor who worries about his student. The non-understanding father who immediately assumes his son is having an affair. And then of course the innocent, maligned monster. Yes, there's Elizabeth, the one woman, but her role seems to be to be worried or to scream. Still, this seems to be a pattern for movies made around this time period - that it's pretty much an all-male main cast with one female in there to provide the soft, nurturing voice.<br /><br />I definitely put this into the must-watch category, to see where strong drama movies came from, right as talking films were bursting onto the scene. And to think that The Jazz Singer was only four years earlier, which was the ground-breaking first partial-talking-film. This must have been a quite exciting time period to live in!<br /><br />Highly recommended.an change over time, though.

0345803507|2.0|If you're reading reviews for book three it probably means you've read the first two and are now wondering if it's worth it to throw away yet more of your time on this series or if you should just cut your losses and move on with your life and spend your time on something else. I opted to go ahead and read the drivel because, heck, it's summer time, I'm on vacation and so what if I'm wasting a few hours of my time on mindless nonsense. Do I regret it. Not really, considering I'd already wasted hours of my time on the first two. I can honestly say that I'm not a better person for having read this series (in fact I think my IQ dropped a few points), but at least I'll be able to understand the conversation when this topic comes up while hanging out with my friends -- which it always does lately.<br /><br />I hate these characters, all of them except Kate, the roommate, who's the only one who recognizes what a sleazeball Christian is. If you're looking for lots of sex, like three or four times a day sex, then book three won't disappoint you. If you're looking for some meaningful relationship building, you'll be disappointed. Once again, Ana only reacts to situations, bites her lip, fists her man's hair and pouts ad nauseum. Once again we hear how hot Christian is, how his pants hang on his hips in just that way. Once again he orders her around, once again she disobeys only to be sorry afterwards because he makes her see the error in her ways and how he really does know better than she does. Once again forcing her to apologize for her disobeying -- much like she apologized for not safe-wording him that time in the first book when he beat the crap out of her -- hello? Sounds like your basic dysfunctional abused girlfriend/wife syndrome if you ask me. We hear all about how smart Ana is because the author tells us that she is, yet she never shows us how smart she is. She shows us how irrational and dull she is.<br /><br />So, in short, if you really feel the need to see howthis series ends and you have $10 and a few hours to spare, go for it. If you have other options and would rather spend your time on something more worthwhile, just ask your girlfriends how the series ends and they'd be happy to tell you saving you the torment of reading it yourself.

B0086HJW76|5.0|This is an album that seems to be a continuance in Joe's music and life timeline.  Everything you love about Joe Walsh is here. The pithy, the reality, the tender, the introspection, the style, the musicality.<br /><br />It's songwriting that's matured in time and is exactly like you would expect in an old friend that you haven't seen in 20 years - you know him, but he's 20 years on. The views (lyrics) are 20 years on, but the music - like you know him - is the same in style. It's an old friend that is joyful to be with, even though a lot of time has passed. Seems like just yesterday, but it's like no time has passed.<br /><br />This point in life resonates, and the title is in perfect sync with where this should be. Analog in a digital world - we are living in the modern and continually progressing world, yet we know where we really are in the reality of it all. It's got Joe's tongue-in-cheek playfulness, but also has great messages (\\"finally learned to live my life one day at a time\\") that resonate with where we fans find ourselves also at this stage of life.<br /><br />Having said all the above, it's all fresh and new and a joy to listen to. To me, it's the ideal statement through music of where we Boomer rockers find ourselves today.<br /><br />I wish I could describe it better! Magnificent!
0307949508|5.0|After having enjoyed the first book in the series so much, I looked forward to reading this second one and I wasn't disappointed. The story was gripping, fast-paced, and even more engaging than the first. While the style and many of the characters are the same as \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\", this is by no means a repeat. Blomkvist felt more like the lead in \\"...Tattoo\\", but here the focus is clearly on Salander. Much of the book is from her point of view and a lot of the story revolves around her past. Those who have read the first book will know what an interesting character she is and it was even better to find out more of her past - her family, the incidents that led officials to label her crazy, and more.<br /><br />Like the first book, this one is part mystery, part thriller. Here there are 3 murders committed and the police quickly identify Salander as the prime suspect. After the fallout from their parting, Blomkvist and Salander aren't exactly on speaking terms, but he still does his best to prove her innocence. Three very different investigations are under way, with the police, Milton Security, and the team at \\"Millennium\\" each trying to determine what happened but each with their own take on it. Salander meanwhile has her own questions and does everything as much on her own as possible. The case involves an expose on the sex trafficking business as well as government secrets.<br /><br />The story quickly roped me in and I wanted to read more and more as I went on. My one complaint is with the ending. While the first book had a satisfying ending where a sequel could be done but the book still felt like a whole, this one finishes with too many loose ends. It's clear that the next book needs to more or less pick up where this one left off, whereas there was some elapsed time between the first and second. There aren't too many unanswered questions, but there are things left unresolved.

B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I loved this app, I was addicted. I had almost all the colors and lots of coins, etc. One day, I went on it and it just led me to the app store everytime, so I thought I will just uninstall it and log back in!<br /><br />Bad Idea! Don't uninstall it, unless you want to start all over again! They sent me a verification email and I typed in the password, I had to completly reset it with a new name and everything! Not cool, OmgPop!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|If you picked this book up looking for the next great American novel and were disappointed then you are the one to blame. Fifty shades is, in many ways, to adults what Twilight is to teens. Is Christian Grey unbelievable? Yes! Is Anastasia annoyingly naive? Yes? Sounds similar to Edward and Bella: right? But, comparisons aside, this book (and trilogy) is incredibly entertaining and absorbing. I'm an English major and I know and appreciate good lit but I never once from page one thought I'd find it here.  I did, however find an interesting story that kept me up at night, a story like nothing I'd read before. Pick this up and enjoy the ride, unless you are looking for something that is great literature in which case I recommend browsing the free kindle books for a classic.
1594202842|2.0|Tiger Mother has some serious issues that are not rooted in Chinese customs<br />but her personality flaws.  I imagine all the men that she has dated (probaly 1 or 2 at the most) were submissive weak minded wimps.  She basically doesnt allow her childeren to be \\"childeren\\".  She is strict displanarian, resembling a angry Catholic school nun. She gloats how smart and talented her child is. What no one told her is IVY League schools are filled thousands of kids more intelligent and better adjusted then her daughter. She didnt create master artist, world renoun pianist, or genius mathmetician.<br /><br />What kind of tyrant mother doesnt allow their kids to have playdates or go to parties. Tiger Mom your lame.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|This book is quite addictive.  I would highly recommend it.  While the writing is at times a little on the amateur side, it pulls together into an entertaining and quick read.  Be warned that you will want to read the whole initial trilogy at least.  The story doesn't end at the first book.
6305546789|5.0|My grandmother is to blame for introducing me to the Halloween franchise when I was a kid. She had the first three movies recorded off of television, in which I borrowed the VHS tape dozens of times. Halloween had a simple plot about a masked killer stalking a teenage babysitter on Halloween night. It could have easily been a dud, but thanks to John Carpenter and Debra Hill's intriguing screenplay and John's visual directing style, the move showed what true horror is. Unlike, the sequels and countless rip-offs, Halloween didn't need to rely on gore, nudity, and graphic language, but instead focused on the character study of Dr. Sam Loomis, played by the late Donald Pleasence, Laurie Strode, played by Jamie Lee Curtis, and the killer himself, Michael Myers. Here, in the original, Michael is just a killer with no motivation, as the idea of Laurie being his sister wasn't introduced until the first sequel.<br /><br />I try to watch Halloween and the The Midnight Hour on Halloween night every year. John's creepy theme throughout the movie always gives me the creeps. Halloween is the best in the franchise, and one of the best slasher movies ever made.<br /><br />My DVD is the 25th Anniversary Edition (aka DiviMaX series) consisting of two discs.<br /><br />Disc One:<br /><br />Widescreen Presentation (2:35:1)<br />Audio Commentary with Writer/Director John Carpenter; Jamie Lee Curtis, and Producer Debra Hill<br /><br />Disc Two:<br /><br />Halloween - A Cut Above the Rest (87 minute documentary)<br />On Location - 25 Years Later<br />Theatrical Trailer<br />TV Spots<br />Radio Spots<br />Poster and Still Gallery<br />Talent Bios<br />DVD-ROM Original Screenplay<br />DVD-ROM Screen Savers
B005LAIHY0|1.0|'Prometheus' SUCKED; no pun intended. I've always been a huge Ridley Scott fan since first witnessing the excitably horrible vision he created with 'Alien;' then the amazingly rendered world of 'Blade Runner' set the tone for the standard of cinematic quality I came to expect from Hollywood throughout the years. But sadly, the Talented Mr. Scott has performed grossly under-par; so far from his own professional standard and what fans who have followed his career throughout the years have come to expect. I do give him credit for taking a huge career risk by attempting to tackle the quandry of questions so expertly divuldged in 'Alien' some 30-odd years ago; but alas, and sadly, it was a dissapointingly failed effort. I've come to the solid conclusion that Mr. Scott is no longer 'hungry' in the way that ambitiously drove him to create the aformentioned efforts mentioned at the beginning of this regrettable review. It seems that after watching the over-hyped half-effort that is 'Prometheus,' he has even lost some respect for the process of giving proper attention to his craft; as if he knows it better than it knows itself. A seeming bit of arrogance and short-sightedness in thinking he is vastly more 'enlightened' than the rest of us dolts seems apperent in his lack of detail to filmmaking basics. Here is where the entire problem with this film lies with me. The most frustrating thing about this film for me to have sat for more than two hours through and witness, was the many technical, behind-the-camera, post-production errors throughout the it (yes, I'm calling it that, sadly in this case). I won't say here what they are, as there are many who have not yet seen it; but the flaws, as well as the uninspired, incoherent, and inconsistant script (or what suffices to pass as a plot). Everything was just so uneven; such a truly sad thing to witness considering the acting talent that was comprised to help pull this effort off (for Guy Pierce in particular; he endured the kind of effort movie magic would've presented over 20 years ago; nothing anyone would expect to see on the silver screen in 2012). To help recover from the gross taste left in my mouth by the wasted two hours of my life watching this movie that I'll never get back, I went home and watched 'Underworld: Awakening' (yes, I did; at least it managed to follow it's plot points better than Mr. Scotts' 'Promethus'), and that very much did the trick. I hope, as time goes on, that people realize the 'Willow' that this film is, nad that Hollywood puts the 'Alien' franchise (if they never intend to do it right) to rest for quite some time to come. Though it hurts me to do so, I htink there will be some out there who will understand the 'one star' I'm this film, as based on the sad, real, dissapointment this experience was for me to have to endure. As a result of witnessing the mish-mash that is 'Prometheus,' I will in no way remotely consider the thouhgt of daring to experience the potential mess that will be his Blade Runner reimagining.

1936608898|5.0|I bought the book last week at a book signing, and I've really been enjoying it.<br /><br />The Hartwigs have done a great job of laying out the info that you need to take control of your health, weight, and cravings. I was happy that the book pretty much led off with the cravings/emotional eating/food/brain connection, but without getting all touchy-feely on us (so guys can use this book, too.)<br /><br />I like that I now have a book that goes into good detail on many of the foods that we should be avoiding in our diets and give us a good idea why, without resorting to the old myths and outdated standbys of things like Glycemic Index.<br /><br />My only beef with the book and others in the modern nutrition genre is the huge amount of references in the back, without any way to know which reference is for which point. If you want to see where someone came up with evidence for something in Chapter 5, there are almost three full pages of references just for Chapter 5 that you would have to research, find, and read.<br /><br />Their Whole30 program, which is 30 days of eating right, is probably the healthiest \\"cleanse\\" one could ever wish for. You will come out the other side healthier, leaner, and knowing a lot more about yourself!<br /><br />Roland
0671027344|5.0|At times Charlie is a little too vulnerable for my taste but he is an amazing character.  The book reminds me a great deal of Catcher In The Rye- so fans of that book will likely be satisfied with this book also. I enjoyed it. :o)
B007J4T2G8|1.0|While thoroughly enjoying the creative review from DS of LA (and all of the related commments), I felt I needed to chalk up another one-star review of Fifty Shades of Grey in order to bring the numbers into the sphere of reality.<br /><br />Honestly, Fifty Shades of Grey is the worst piece of tripe (and I took a literary fiction writing course, so trust me, I know tripe) I have ever read. Ok, partially read... well, mostly gagged over.<br /><br />The characters in Fifty Shades of Grey, if they can be called that, are cardboard cut-outs stood up in God knows where cuz it sure ain't Portland or Seattle. Pike Market??? geez.. There is nothing about Ana that makes me want to care about her. She is beautiful and thinks she is a skinny gutter snipe? Not buying it. She TRIPS into the office of the all-powerful Christian Grey and he thinks \\"endearing\\"? Nut uh. She bites her lip like an overwrought 12-year old and he wants to bite it too? Come onnnnn....<br /><br />I thankfully have never read the Twilight series which apparently this book is modeled after but I sure hope it's better. What do teen porn fans have against the Pacific Northwest anyway?<br /><br />The \\"plot\\" is completely unbelievable at best and cartoon ridiculous at worst. Can we say cliche? Geez... Cinderalla is a more believable plot than this trash. I loved all of the counting of phrases that my fellow Kindle owners have done. I am sure that was far more entertaining than the book itself. For an updated count, see DS of LA's review update.<br /><br />Has our tender young author never heard of the concept of \\"show, don't tell\\"? Tolstoy was a master at creating whole chunks of plot merely by describing what could be seen around the characters with a density and richness that made the story almost quite literally jump off the page. James is a master of repetitive phrases that are absolutely meaningless and in no way give us a sense of her characters.<br /><br />Sadly, I succumbed to the hype and actually downloaded Fifty Shades of Grey onto my Kindle Fire. I know better and am disappointed in myself. So, all of you one-stars, let's go out there and help others avoid this mind numbing, ridiculous piece of triple crap. Write your own review and restore the Best Seller List to its former glory!oaded Fifty Shades of Grey onto my Kindle Fire. I know better and am disappointed in myself.

B0088RQ4X4|3.0|The dog was great. He gave the movie an extra star. The jumping back and fourth between locations/times wasn't really needed. Would have been much cleaner to just have a simple story. I wasn't crazy about the \\"Q\\" like characters that could do anything and chose to meddle in the lives of lesser beings. Sometimes these types of fun entertainment flicks try to hard to be something they're not.

Written by the men who created the language...it doesn't get any better than this!<br /><br />This is a rather small book compared to other programming language's books, but it's written in a concise, straight-forward style that honors the C language itself. Quit thinking about it....just order the book...it deserves a space on your book shelf.
B000001GXC|3.0|These are fully committed performances and unlike one or two others I cannot fault the recording quality.  My major problem with it is perhaps a matter of taste; I am accustomed to the Adagio in no. 3 being solemn but flowing; at the slow speed Karajan takes it sounds somewhat ponderous and a little too Tuetonic to me.  This may simply be my problem for having grown up with a pacier slow movement but I can't help it. Those who don't have a problem with this should love the disc.
B0009S2T0M|3.0|A Korean action-suspense flick that, like many far-east thrillers, doesn't hesitate to take things well into the realm of the taboo. In a lot of ways that's a blast of fresh air, as no doubt an American version wouldn't have been half as biting, daring or dark, and its dedication to probing the unacceptable makes up a large part of Oldboy's character. It's not those stabs outside the boundaries that bothered me about this one, though, so much as it was the refusal to bask in them for more than a few instants before jolting off in search of new depths. The establishing story is almost perfect, setting the stage with an everyman who's been transformed by fifteen years of unexplained imprisonment, then following his violent, dedicated search for both suspect and reason. It's an act the tangled, overstretched follow-through can't hope to match, even when its mysteries and motivations are finally, confusingly, lain bare. Oldboy deserves recognition for its style, demeanor and intense action scenes, but the plot often veers into weirdness and depravity for unclear reasons that don't always benefit the bigger picture.

B0079XPUOW|4.0|I enjoyed Redshirts quite a bit, and think other fans of Trek will find it funny as well.  Just like all other Scalzi books, it is fast paced, well written, and makes you keep turning pages.<br /><br />(sidenote: Mr. Scalzi was in Milwaukee last night at the Boswell Book Company for a book discussion and signing.  If you ever get the chance to see him in person run to the event and take your friends as he's a very engaging speaker and shows so much passion for his writing that you feel energized just being there!)

B004HKJDMU|3.0|Has all notes, formulas. Other than that this is a book essentially for professional economists, a very good rendition.<br /><br />Found out that the popular understanding of Keynes, that all gov't spending to get out of a recession/depression is good, is false! Keynes' famous quote about burying the money and letting people dig it up, is given as an example of something the gov't could do that was better than what they were doing in the context of the time. He makes it clear that to make gov't spending work requires serious economic thinking and effort to design programs that engage the market to get the acceptable return on the dollars spent.<br /><br />I don't recommend this book unless you are a real economist, or you are prepared to wade through tons of economic jargon with little to no elaboration on the technical terms.

B007V4LKRU|5.0|It is a fun journey through a lifelong tale in the fashion of The Fountain of Lamneth. The music is definitely superior to their last few studio releases (not that I would ever bash a Rush release) but songs like BU2B and Headlong Flight really kick it up a notch. It IS a completely different style from Caress of Steel and 2112, which is what a lot of people compare it to because it is modern heavy progressive and has none of the classic shrill vocal and gutteral crunch. I am also all for less MIDI crap and more just playing the 3 instruments :)

0451228375|4.0|After over 800 reviews, there is little more to say. If you liked \\"Pillars\\" yu will like \\"World\\".<br />I rated this as a 4 for the following reasons:<br />1) I don't like to read about war and battles - they are boring to me. Fortunately the section on the war between the English and the French did not go on for long. Some parts of it were actually interesting such as the effect of the long-bow.<br />2) A little too predictable and in some cases a little far-fetched. Example - a nun renouncing her vows after many, many years in the cloister.<br />3) A little too much sex and rape. I think it was put in because it was expected, though the author doesn't take time with too much detail. I certainly am not a prude, but too many novels of this type fill up pages with sex just because they think they need sex.<br /><br />I was very fond of it for the following reasons.<br />1) I love reading about the plague and what happened to society.<br />2) I love reading about conflicts between and within the clergy and the abuses of the clergy.<br />3) I love reading about the attempts improve ancient and rather stupid medical practices.<br />4) The details of the rebuilding of sections of the church and the problems of building a bridge were written so that even I (whose does not have any engineering background) could understand them.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I have played with this for several days now on my Kindle Fire.  The pieces are a bit small on the tougher settings, my favorite of course, but still workable.

1936608898|5.0|Perspective is the most valuable thing an author can impart. You can teach facts, you can spew data, you can quote studies... but it takes mastery to transport a reader to a completely different level of understanding of a subject. Facts are quickly forgotten, but perspective is like wisdom; once you have it, the world looks different. And that's what Melissa and Dallas have captured here. It's perspective on paper, and it has the ability to change the way you approach your food, your lifestyle, and your health.<br /><br />Think quickly to your bookshelf: how many cookbooks do you have? How many diet books have you bought? And how many of them are just re-shufflings of the same-old, same-old? Do any of them really transform your mind? Do any of them really have enough impact to change not just what you're going to eat this Thursday, but how you understand food, and will for the rest of your days? It Starts With Food is one of those transformational reads that teaches, and not just informs. And, it's funny. And entertaining. And it's got style, substance, and sophisticated simplicity in spades.<br /><br />One of the problems we've all had with books is that the information is either too general to apply to us, or so specific that it excludes major chunks of the population. It Starts With Food, however, is great at giving you the low-down on a subject--be it dietary fat, omega-3's, or guidance on dealing with the emotions that arise when you start changing your diet--both from a here's-the-big-picture level, and from a here's-how-you-individualize-it-to-your-situation level. It's genius, really, and not something I've seen in too many books before this.<br /><br />Einstein's famous quote, \\"We can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them,\\" is supremely applicable here, because most nutrition/diet books out there these days are written at the level of the Technician. Meaning, most books are all about recipes, combinations, and how to mash your macronutrients together. It's as if all the pieces of the puzzle just get shuffled into a different picture, depending on the educational history of the author. But It Starts With Food is different. It's written on a whole 'nother level (from Technician to Professor, or something).<br /><br />In short, it's a genius read. It'll help you make sense of nutrition in a way you probably never have before (unless you've been to a Whole9 workshop before), and it'll help you get oriented to how to get healthy. Really healthy. Healthy in a way you may have never experienced before, even if you've already read a bunch of other paleo-esque nutrition books.to mash your macronutrients together.

B006GHA9QQ|5.0|Look, I won't go into what this beautiful musical is about since others have already said plenty . My biggest issue with some other reviewers, NOT all, is that too many are stuck on the original \\"Phantom of the Opera\\". POTO is wonderful but I don't consider any one musical to be a masterpiece. As a matter of fact, I judge them each on its own merits and some I like more than others. Personally, I like \\"Love Never Dies\\" better than \\"Phantom of the Opera\\". It would profit others to be more open-minded to the musical.<br /><br />  Furthermore, I am thoroughly impatient with snobs who are very nit picky and demand that events more closely resemble the original Gaston Leroux book. Grow up,already! So the sequel has nothing to do with Leroux's book but is based on \\"Phantom of Manhattan\\" which I never did read just the original. Just for your information, a sequel DOES NOT mean it should be a continuation of the same plot line. Sequels are meant to move the story along. So, LND takes place in America on Coney Island which is a place with which I am familiar. In the early 1900s it would be a perfect place to hide anonymously among people whom society deemed misfits and not fit to socialize among the rest of the population. Besides, Andrew LLoyd Webber mentioned in an interview that he always considered POTO to be a cliffhanger and he always wanted to do a follow-up musical for the past 20 years.<br /><br />  Also, some have issues with how the characters have changed from the original. Well, if anyone went through a traumatic experience such as the fire at the Opera Populaire then people<br />do change for the better or the worse. Some become weaker, some stronger depending how deeply those individuals are affected. Christine, Erik, Raoul, Madame Giry, and Meg Giry would not be the same people as before the fire. As for the continuation of the date line and other minor points not making sense to others I say: yada, yada, yada! The Australian version was reworked and for those who DO possess an imagination pretend that there is no continuation flow. I did and it works great! Again, that falls under nit picky, nit picky, nit picky! Please DO grow up!<br /><br />  Lastly, to each his own. If you've given this musical piece a chance and still don't like it, well, that's that. Nobody will like everything someone else does.<br /><br />  Ewa
B0036EH3U2|5.0|A friend of mine had been pushing me to start watching this for some time, and I had resisted.  I finally watched an episode from early season 2 on BBC America, a horribly low-def experience, but was hooked on the story line.  After recording it for a couple of weeks, I was so hooked that I couldn't wait for the entire series to be broadcast, so I purchased this blu-ray set, and it doesn't disappoint.  The images are spectacular, and it only enhances the overall experience of what is arguably the best sci-fi series ever.  Far, far better than the original series, with some very intriguing sub plots, great fx, and dramatic storyline.

0345803485|4.0|It appears the negative reviewers fall into two categories - those who criticized the book based on the cost (and in most cases commented before reading any of the three) and those who are annoyed with themselves for purchasing a product without doing their research (either anticipating more of a \\"literary\\" experience or not expecting the degree of sexual references, etc).<br /><br />Those who actually read the books and appreciated the intent, seem to have truly enjoyed them.  Anyone who can write/publish material that receives this much attention is entitled to recognition and frankly, respect.  It was a few hours of my life well spent - I have wasted much more on much less.  As another reader commented - \\"lighten up\\"!!
B0070Z4M4I|3.0|I just watched this 2011 version of The Thing and please understand that I have watched and thoroughly enjoyed John Carpenter's version, and I must admit it is my favorite horror movie of all time.<br /><br />On the plus side, there still is the tension of who is \\"The Thing\\" that was in JC's version. Also the amount of dumb horror moments is at a minimum. I really only counted 1 \\"Why would you do that!?\\" that moment that makes some horror movies pointless to watch in my opinion.<br /><br />Now for some negatives. I am going to call it a HD release. If you have seen the 1982 version you know when all of the key parts are going to happen. It's great that the writers didn't stray to far from the path, but they could have at least gone site seeing in terms of the bulk of the movie. While it is fun for nostalgic's sake, it loses points for being predictable. Also, a lot of the human tension seems to have been replaced by action. It is not to much action to be unbearable, but what make the 1982 version fun was you were coming up with your own ideas on who the Thing was. Not to mention you only saw the thing in a full shot for a handful of times, while in this version seeing the Thing happens more frequently and longer. In The 1982 version I would say 70-30 Tension to action, this made it feel almost 50-50 (-2).<br /><br />Although it is predictable it is a lot of fun when you see items from The 1982 version make an appearance, such as the Ax stuck in the wooden door.<br /><br />While I am happy to see that they didn't turn The Thing into an action shooter, I wish they would have at least tried something different. They didn't have much source material other then an ax in a wall but they could have at least gave it a college try to mix it up.<br /><br />Overall if you are a fan of the 1982 version it deserves a rent. It's fun to see all of the nods that are in this movie.

1936608898|5.0|I highly recommend this book for anyone looking to learn how to implement a paleo/anti-inflammatory nutritional lifestyle and why. It ties together the science with the practical in a clean, concise way that is easy to implement. Having been following Dallas and Melissa's work for some time, I was really impressed with how much new information and insight I picked up from the book.<br /><br />Don't want the why? The authors give clear shortcut points in the book where you can skip ahead and just get to the how-to.

B0083J8DR2|3.0|yet another appearance of the elusive nigel holmes, brother of sherlock.  but never described in any of the stories i read.  seemed like a curious introduction and a more curious ommission later.  and sherlock seems to do little except lose to moriarty throughout this thing, the professor himself being disappointingly lustreless in person.  only in one story is any allusion made to holmes' physical power (bends a poker straight),and only in one to his \\"jiu jitsu\\" skills  (grapples with moriarty at reichnbach falls).  emphasis unpon both of these is sustained in these very physical renditions.  but it seems i have not read all of doyles' stories (my \\"complete\\" anthology wasn't).  sherlock II does show modest imagination.  chess players above 2000 rating are certain to analyse their game of \\"blitz\\".  give it a 3 plus.
B007PAAO0Y|5.0|Every now and then, an album will come out that leaves people scratching their heads wondering how it even got made:  Bobby Womack's THE BRAVEST MAN IN THE UNIVERSE is such an album.  Produced by Richard Russell and Damon Albarn (of Gorillaz and Blur fame), this release is laden with electronic rhythms, synthesizers, and keyboards.  The ingredients should sound strange: a 68-year old 70's R&B legend, creating a new album (his first in over a decade), produced by one of the guys behind Blur's Britpop.  The result however, is just as puzzling as its ingredients: it's fantastic.<br /><br />In the middle of the album, the track \\"Dayglo Reflection\\" starts with a quote by Sam Cooke: \\"as a singer grows older, his conception grows a little deeper, because he lives life and he understands what he is trying to say a little more.\\"  This singular sentence sums up everything THE BRAVEST MAN IN THE UNIVERSE represents.  Bobby Womack sounds just as comfortable here as he does in any of his previous releases.  The juxtaposition of Womack's soulful croon and the album's electronic vibe works well and is rarely distracting.  Rather than sounding anachronistic or dated, Womack sounds fresh and comfortable; if Tricky (circa Maxinquaye) grew up listening to gospel records, the results would be this.<br /><br />The album begins with Womack nearly shouting \\"The bravest man in the universe is the one who has forgiven first.\\"  This introduction quickly slides into pounding, dark electronic synthesizers; it quickly pulls the listener in.  This title track is followed by \\"Please Forgive My Heart,\\" and by this point, it becomes obvious that this album isn't just a gimmick - it's earnest and sincere.  \\"Dayglo Reflection\\" offers a thoughtful duet between Womack and Lana Del Ray.  \\"Love is Gonna Lift You Up\\" is an infectious gospel-influenced track that can't help but radiate its optimism.  The album ends on the stomping \\"Jubilee,\\" which is a stark contrast from the mellow and dark opening track.  It works well though, and it ends the album on an optimistic view of the future.<br /><br />Fans of Massive Attack, Marvin Gaye, Portishead, and Gorillaz's THE FALL will find a lot to love here.  THE BRAVEST MAN IN THE UNIVERSE is satisfying for longtime fans and for new listeners alike.  Standout tracks include: \\"If There Wasn't Something There,\\" \\"Bravest Man in the Universe,\\" and \\"Love is Gonna to Life You Up.\\"It works well though, and it ends the album on an optimistic view of the future.<br /><br />Fans of Massive Attack, Marvin Gaye, Portishead, and Gorillaz's THE FALL will find a lot to love here.

B0086700CM|3.0|I like this game, but on my Razr, it keeps quitting on me in the middle of the game. Not sure why.

B005LAIHIQ|3.0|I didn't see the original TV series, so I'm not going to bitch about the movie like so many people have. Rather, I'm going to review it as it standing alone.<br /><br />Burton, as usual, combines visual imagery with a Gothic story suffused with humor. Barnabas is a resurrected vampire that got screwed over centuries ago by a witch he spurned and he now goes to his family's estate, where his down on their luck descendants dwell. There are countless jokes having to do with his being a stranger in a strange land and his anachronistic attire and speech. The witch, incidentally, is still around and still wants to rekindle the love and, if that fails, do away with him all over again. It's a silly plot, sure, but what the hell, it was still enjoyable.

B003Y5H5EW|4.0|I have seen all of the Underworld movies.  This one, by far, unfortunately did not live up to my expectations.  Maybe the next movie, if any, will be better.  If so perhaps it should be the last Underworld installment.

1936608898|5.0|I was introduced to Dallas and Melissa two years ago as they carried their well researched and daily applied \\"Whole 30\\" message around the country.  Ever since, every one of the hundreds of athletes I have trained are given \\"The Whole 30\\" material.  This is not a program, diet or method; this is being armed with knowledge and a common sense emotionally balanced approach to food so that we can all make are own decisions about what goes into our body.  Their writing is concise and quick, this is definitely a \\"users\\" manual, not a graduate thesis.  The book contains too many to count \\"AH HA\\" moments, when you read experiences and symptoms and realize they are talking about you or someone you know.  This is not a diet book, this is taking back control over your own body and will book.  If you scoured the Internet and library for months you might be able to find all this info, but you would never put it together in such a well thought out easy to understand format.  If you have figured out that what everyone else is doing is going to get you the same results as everyone else, THEN GET THIS BOOK, I WATCH IT CHANGE LIVES FOR THE BETTER EVERY DAY.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|i have only had the watch for a couple of months and i bought it for a life time or more. the cloth band was not bad but i know i wanted to replace it with a metal bracelet as before i ordered it so i did it looks great, i set the watch by my phone that updates all the time for perfect time and in two months it is still in perfect time has not lost a second in two months. not too bulky, not too flashy a perfect every day watch that never needs batteries.<br /><br />the only thing i would have wanted is to be able to self wind the watch, and it would be nice if it had a power bar so you know how wound it is.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I adore the characters... Toby and Ruth do a great job...perfect chemistry...this version makes the new one horrible! I have watched this one again and again. My husband even likes this version.
0345803485|1.0|My husband is sweet and bought this book for me due to the \\"sexy buzz\\".  It is so poorly written. Has it even been properly edited?  Impressively bad. I started to realize it wasn't even original work a few chapters in, and was shocked to find that page 72 was lifted straight out of the poorly written (but creative- the movie is enjoyable) first Twilight book. I actually stopped reading at this point, put the book down and started rattling off to my sweet husband that this was bad plagiarism - I could site the same characters, their mannerisms, their backgrounds, the location, the exact scene and dialogue from Twilight on page 72!  You know= Edward is treating Bella to a meal and is stressed because he has warned her to stay away, but says he \\"doesn't have the strength to stay away from her anymore\\" and she says.... \\"then don't\\". Very sexy, yes. Very stolen, yes!! I find it appalling that this person doesn't site Twilight as the basis for this book.  I did look online and found that this was a fan fiction that appeared first on the Twilight site- so that is clearly evidence that this is not completely original work. Was she and her editor too lazy or untalented to change a few details to  mask her very clear story and character copying? Or were some lazy, greedy publishers too eager too have another poorly written re-write of Twilight with some sex in it this time to re-sell. There are some bad choices here.
0345803493|5.0|These books are not just about sex for anyone who might be wondering. But man is the sex good! This is a love story that is very captivating and interesting to say the least. You don't have to worry about Christian being absent in the second book like you did with Edward in Twilight. When I finished the first book, I was worried that Christian would be absent some what in the second book but I was wrong, it picks right back up and keeps going just where you want it too!
B000ZBPQEO|5.0|I'm not going to review this product itself, others have done an excellent job.<br />I would like to put in a positive word for EMI.<br />I purchased the Callas Studio Recordings and the Karajan Complete Recordings a couple of months ago.<br />Both sets were missing 1 CD each and each had another duplicated.<br />After contacting EMI by email, I was given the run around.<br />On the third attempt I received this reply:\\"I've just taken over this role from my predecessor and it would seem that your order has been lost somewhere in the transition process.

B001MCOXIK|5.0|One thing to note- I am HUGE fan of Black Sabbath's first 5 or 6 albums with Ozzy. After Technical Ecstasy- I was a little disappointed. I grew up on most of Ozzy's sabbath. That is until I heard Ronnie James Dio's Sabbath- who is something of a different Sabbath all together. Iommi's riffs still sound like him- with perhaps more melodious touches and flourishes. Butler plays more with the kit instead of just doubling Iommi's parts. Vinny Appice's drumming is precise & often I feel is so under rated as a musician in general. (Obviously he's got a reputation to live up to with his older brother Carmine- a legend in his own right) It can't be stated how great Ronnie's voice was. The older he got- his voice was always in great shape...<br />I remember being blown away by this whole record - to me this is a great \\"comeback\\" record by Sabbath. Sorry, I don't call this band heaven and hell. Just Sabbath 2.0. You will always have the original Sabbath, but to me the other great version of Sabbath was Dio's era. And this is certainly a testament to Sabbath's amazing legacy. \\"Computer God\\"- amazing opener. Kicks your ass with bombastic hits and master riffery. Rarely does this album let up - lulling you sometimes into false senses of sercurity before launching another bombardment on the senses. (Forgive the trite cliche's) \\"After All (the dead)\\" to me is classic Black Sabbath- creepy riffs, minor keys, tempo's that any \\"doomster\\" can nod their head to. And why not? Iommi and co- helped invent the f'n musical genre known as metal, and all it's sub genre's (doom metal, stoner, blah blah blah)...One other thing to note is Dehumanizer's production values. Not exactly THE heaviest Sabbath's ever sounded, but overall, it's a good sounding record, that has just enough low-end to satisfy my cravings. The pacing is perfect, a faster track , then a slow creepy number. Dehumanizer, you are without a doubt the underated gem for me. I know people think of Dio's Sabbath and think Heaven and Hell and or The Mob Rules, which are good albums- but to me, I'm an underdog guy- I like this album perhaps more. It epitomizes what I think of from Black Sabbbath. 5 STARS!d Hell and or The Mob Rules, which are good albums- but to me, I'm an underdog guy- I like this album perhaps more. It epitomizes what I think of from Black Sabbbath. 5 STARS!
0345803493|5.0|I am so glad to have ordered the trilogy. Far fetched? Yes! But a very easy read. I would recommend to my girlfriends. It's spicy, sassy, and sexy. A great escape from everyday life. I would definetely recommend purchasing the trilogy. Happy reading, Ladies..... :- )
0982743726|5.0|I love a good medieval fantasy novel, and this book didn't disappoint! As other reviewers have said, it's a page-turner. The non-stop action kept me glued to the pages, and I loved the fact that I didn't want to stop reading! That's exactly what I hope for when I pick up an adventure story.<br /><br />Even though there was more violence than what I usually go for, it felt very true to the world, and I've definitely read more graphic/violent books, especially when it comes to medieval-set novels (THE JESTER comes to mind). I'd definitely recommend THE BONE SWORD to any fantasy/adventure lover! It's a LOT of fun and the story will keep you hooked!

This is a great book series. The love story is astounding and I will read them all again. Don't hesitate buying these books.
0345472322|4.0|I loved this book.  Starting out I was convinced that I was of the growth mindset.  However, I became less and less sure as I continued to read.  When I reached the section on wanting to be special, I had the wind knocked out of me.  This was me!  This section had my name all over it.  It was clear, I had been living with a fixed mindset.  Yet, this was great news.  I could now see how I had been limiting myself and this gave me huge access to anything I wanted.<br /><br />I grew up with the idea, firm belief really, that I was not smart and that I was shy.  This was me and there was nothing I could do about it.  What a relief to really get at a core level that there is something I can do about it.  Adopting a growth mindset, I can see that I can do whatever it is I want if I want it bad enough.<br /><br />This book has hugely helped me and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it to parents.

B003V1WTMM|5.0|There is a large body of fiction concerning the revelation of deep, dark family secrets, but Kate Morton's stand out from the rest. The plotlines are not so terribly different, but the quality of writing, her artistry with words, makes all the difference. Her characters are less predictable than many, and likable without being overwhelming. Often I find myself liking books simply because I've fallen in love with the characters that populate them, but in the case of Morton's three (so far) books, her wordcraft carries the story and the characters, turning both into something very special.
B0042RJWTC|1.0|I received Tudors as a present from my daughter.  The first set had issues with a lot of scratched up disks making it impossible to properly hear or see what was going on.  My daughter complained and a second set reached my home.  This set was actually worse than the first set.  The first disc was tremendously scratched up and could not be used.  It seems to me that there is something wrong with DVD's sold as new that are so defective.  Where did David Pereira get them from???  Perhaps he should get his money back. Also the discs seem to be numbered incorrectly.

0439023513|4.0|I felt like Mockingjay was interesting throughout, and from the early pages of the book I could tell it was going to be more exciting than Catching Fire.  My overall analysis of the book is that it is not quite as thrilling cover-to-cover as The Hunger Games, but Collins ends the trilogy well.<br /><br />What really excited me about Mockingjay was that in my head I was able to design the exact plot of the whole book after reading the introductory chapters.  As chapter after chapter went by, the story largely went along with what I had expected, and satisfyingly so.  The last hundred pages or so were filled with surprises and left me glued to the book until there was no more to read.  I can understand why some people were not pleased with the way the trilogy ended, but I thought it was excellent.<br /><br />One last thing--I don't think I mentioned it in my other reviews, but the way that Collins describes the functions of the media and of propaganda in determining political power and leading to revolutions is marvelous.  Reading the books highlights what an important social tool the television really is.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|I will not go on at great length since some reviewers have done so eloquently, sometimes well beyond what is necessary for a rock album(!). Let me just say this. I've been a fan of Rush since discovering them as a teenager in the mid-1980s. I have every studio and live album they have ever put out, and I've seen them in concert eight times and have tickets for one of their upcoming fall shows. This album is AMAZING. Not since \\"Moving Pictures\\" have I enjoyed a Rush album like this one.  The band's resurgence in the 2000s with the \\"Vapor Trails\\" and \\"Snakes and Arrows\\" albums put them on a trajectory that blended their old styles with a modern rock sensibility.  This album does this even better than those two did.  What I like is that they continue to demonstrate what can be good and powerful about progressive hard rock, not only in instrumentation but in lyrical content. The \\"album\\" has been a dying art in the music world, but Rush has helped to keep it alive. I just hope they continue this trend (while their aging bodies can still pump out hard-driving rock!) and give the fans another album, harkening back to the 1970s, with not only album concept but epic songs. \\"Clockwork Angels\\" hints at that potential, with some songs clocking in over 7 minutes. It has the feel of a \\"2112\\" for 2012. Personally, if a song is too long for the radio, then it is probably just right for me.... This album will be heralded as one of this Canadian power trio's all-time best.
B007L6VR12|5.0|Please also check out Roger Ebert's review--he gets it:  [...]    I especially like what he says of the underlying wistfulness of life--the transcience of even a happy moment, because of life moving ever forward--I thought, how rare for a director to touch down on such a subject that is rarely spoken of.

B0006GAOBI|2.0|In my opinion, this movie is pretty terrible. I bought it about a year ago, after reading that my favorite celeb likes it and seeing the high IMDB rating. I finally watched it several months back and could not understand why on earth so many people enjoyed it. Then a couple weeks ago, my brother, two cousins and I (mixture of males and females, ages ranging from 24 to 40+) were searching through my collection for a movie to watch. I warned them that I found \\"Donnie Darko\\" terrible, but they still wanted to check it out because of the buzz. I gave in, hoping I might form a different opinion after watching it again. At various points during the movie, my family members commented about the slow pace and/or the bizarre dialogue and occurrences. By the end of the movie, all three of them had come to the same conclusion as I had: this is quite a bad movie. So perplexed by the ratings and reviews, we watched the bonus material. Even with a few things we didn't pick up on explained, still a bad movie.    When I think about \\"Donnie Darko\\" and the positive reception it gets, I almost feel like this has to be a joke. Today I randomly Googled the movie to see if there was still something I was missing. I read this entire article: [...]. It didn't change my opinion. I can't believe the creators went so far as to make an elaborate website: [...]. I can't believe both the IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes pages for the movie have such high numbers. I can't believe there are all these positive reviews here. The problem is not that I don't understand the theories about how everything ties together and the overall meaning. The problem is not that I can't suspend reality. Or that I judge movies harshly (I rarely consider a movie \\"terrible\\"). I argue it's that, no matter how you slice it, \\"Donnie Darko\\" is sucky. I am giving it two stars because at least it makes you think about relatively interesting things and because the awfulness of it is a little entertaining, as is the fact that so many people think it's great. I probably wouldn't be leaving this review if it weren't for the deficiency of similarly poor ones. I almost feel a duty to write this.

B004SBQAN8|2.0|\\"I Am Number Four\\" is nominally about aliens from outer space hunting other aliens who've been here for a while. The action begins in media res as we watch alien Number Three (Greg Townley) and his Guardian (euben Langdon) fall to the Mogadorians, led by the Commander (Kevin Durand). It's not easy being a number.<br /><br />Our hero hiding under the pseudonym John Smith (Alex Pettyfer) is a good-looking, buff outcast who just can't fit in. He's Number Four, an alien from the planet Lorien, on the run from the aforementioned Mogadorians that destroyed their home planet. Why? No clue, and director D.J. Caruso isn't in the mood to explain. Number Four is unhappy because he has to keep moving from place to place to hide from the hunters at the insistence of his Guardian Henri (Timothy Olyphant). Number Four's super power, known as legacies, are coming to the fore as he matures, including telekinesis and glowing hands. And you thought hairy palms were bad!<br /><br />Moving to Paradise, OH, Number Four tries to blend in but does anything but as he makes friends with conspiracy geek Sam Goode (Callan McAuliffe), romances photographer Sarah Hart (Dianna Agron), and crosses paths with her ex-boyfriend and current bully Mark James (Jake Abel). Throw in a hot Australian chick (Teresa Palmer) who can walk away from an explosion in slow-motion, a cute puppy that's not a cute puppy, and two giant flying lizards and it's easy to see the fingerprints of producer Michael Bay all over this film.<br /><br />The acting in \\"I Am Number Four\\" is bad. Pettyfer mumbles. Agron shoots pouty glances. Abel sneers. In fact, the most charismatic is Olyphant beneath layers of makeup, with his off-kilter cadence and his delightfully sarcastic tone as he gloats about taking over the planet. Even the dog is a bad actor.<br /><br />\\"I Am Number Four\\" is shamelessly vapid, playing to stereotypes, ripping off better movies, and covering it up with lots of action. Why do the Loriens need to be killed in a particular order? What's up with Number Six's legacy that seems to make her nigh unstoppable? Why are these ridiculous aliens trying to blow up the Earth? And why do they bring giant pterodactyl monsters with them to do it?<br /><br />You're not going to get any answers. But then, you shouldn't expect any. The original book upon which this movie was based was written by James Frey author of the fraudulent memoir¸ A Million Little Pieces.n a particular order?
