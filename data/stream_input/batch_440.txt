B0001LJC2K|5.0|Wow... this is amazing!! I really love this cd & this band... I had first heard of them from a friend & then i felt like buying a cd so i saw this & was like... ok i'll buy it. here's a track-by-track review <br /> <br />1-Intro- It's like a 30 second intro & there's nothing you can really say about it but it's kind of scary the first time you listen to it. <br /> <br />2-Apocalypse Please-(8/10)-Kind of annoying the first time you listen to it but it is a great song & i love it now!! It has a really cool piano part! <br /> <br />3-Time Is Running Out-(9/10)-This is a really good song but not as good as the others on the cd. <br /> <br />4-Sing For Absolution-(8/10)-I didn't really like this song that much until like a week ago. But it's great. <br /> <br />5-Stockholm Syndrome-(10/10)-This is a great song too!! It is really jammin'!! lol - - It's hard not to dance to it <br /> <br />6-Falling Away With You-(7/10)-Kind of cliche - - could be mistaken for some kind of emo band - - but still a great song <br /> <br />7-Interlude-What was the point of this? - - It's just kind of a bunch of random chords... oh well it doesn't really matter <br /> <br />8-Hysteria-(9/10)- A good song... i don't think it would do really that good on it's own though... but i don't know <br /> <br />9-Blackout-(10/10)-Great!! It's kind of boring when it's the first time you listen to it! But it's different & that's great! <br /> <br />10-Butterflies & Hurricanes- (10/10)-I love this song!! It has the kickinest piano part when it switches to its 'classical moment' The leas singer actually plays that piano... lol & i play the piano too so that's inspirational to me. <br /> <br />11-The Small Print - (10/10) - This is a great song musically with really clever lyrics - it's kind of funny. It's perfect. <br /> <br />12-Endlessly - (6/10) - Kind of catchy but pretty boring when you listen to the whole thing - - i never skip it though <br /> <br />13-Thoughts Of A Dying Atheist - (9/10) - Anotherreally clever song - - It gets stuck in my head all the time. <br /> <br />14-Ruled By Secrecy - (7/10) - Pretty boring at the beginning but listen to the whole thing - - about halfway through the piano comes in with another kickin' part!! It's pretty cool but then it gets boring again. <br /> <br />& the verdict is... BUY THIS CD NOW!!! It is perfect! & if you're a dork like me then you can get the sheet music to some of these songs & other songs by muse at [...] - - i don't think it's the 'official site' but it's a pretty good one. <br /> <br />But yeah muse is such a great band & this is such a great cd!!
B00005JKGO|2.0|This film is a mess. It doesn't even come close to his other films. It has a few moments but the overall tone of this film is very simular to that of a fart. I hate to bash Fellini because I do love his films. I have heard people say he's overrated. I could never understand why someone would say such a thing. Now I know why. Because they watched La Docle Vita and never bothered to watch any of his earlier films. <br />La Dolce Vita is an attempt at delivering the same message that Michelangelo Antonioni's L'Avventura did. I also despise L'Avventura. Antonioni was the worst thing that ever happend to Italian Cinema. I understand that later on in his career Fellini admired Antonioni's films. I think La Dolce Vita was the result of Fellini's admiration for Antonioni. I really wish Fellini spent more time admiring Pier Paulo Pasolini. Pasolini's flims blew Antonioni's pretentious crap away.

1400032717|5.0|This book is a strange one. It is not entirely traditional as it experiments somewhat with layout and typography, even going so far as to number the chapters in prime numbers, but it is entirely accessible unlike many experimental books. This is because all the idiosyncrasies of form are driven by the content, and it is not just the author trying to be avant garde. <br /> <br />The story is told in the first-person from the perspective of a teenager with some form of autism, and stays in character completely so that in much of the book the reader actually knows more about what is going on around the character Christopher than he does himself. <br /> <br />I would normally hesitate to call a book life-changing, but have very personal reasons to do so in this case. I am a parent of a boy with learning difficulties and although he is very different to Christopher in the book, I did find myself thinking a lot about what life must be like from his point of view, and how I should modify my behaviour to take that into account. There is obviously a lesson to be learned about how we deal with any other people and whether we properly understand their point of view, but it is especially valid with children, and even more so if they have learning difficulties. <br /> <br />So the fact that I am now thinking differently and acting differently does not make it an exaggerated claim that this book changed my life, and on top of that it is well-written and keeps you wanting to know what happens next. I really do not see how, in those circumstances, I could give it any less than 5 stars. It's a wonderful book. Another enjoyable novel I would like to recommend is The Losers' Club by Richard Perez -- all I can say is that it moved me. <br /> <br />
B00005JMEW|3.0|Quentin Tarentino is One of those Directors you either feel is very Creative or you feel He is very Over-Indulgent&this Film is a combination of both. Uma THruman is His Modern Day Pam Grier getting down. I dug the fight scenes&the Music worked,but some things sorta made the film lag in spots.interesting but some things could have been trimmed out. still Tarentino will have you talking one way or the other.
B00005JMX6|3.0|A geriatric woman with a horrible cough brought on by decades of smoking. A couple with four noisy dogs and four kids who like matches. These are the people who live next door to me. Not one of them looks like Elisha Cuthbert. But one can dream. This is yet another member of the teen sex comedy canon and it's a bit better than most others recently in that genre. It might be a downright monstrosity to some, and it just may be a breezy surprise for others. Granted, it's fluff thru and thru, but it was better than I had expected. Emile Hirsch stars as Matthew Kidman, an ordinary kid with the nice boy next door demeanor. The do gooder striving to graduate high school and become the next president. In walks his beautiful new neighbor Danielle(Elisha Cuthbert)from Los Angeles,who is housesitting next door for her aunt. After an eyeful of a first meeting, the two become inseperable and Matthew can't believe his good luck. That a gorgeous, hot, and sexy blonde is with him, and rubbing it in the faces of the brainless jocks. But all is not merry when he finds out, through his sleazoid friend Eli(Chris Marquette), that Danielle is actually a porn star. Things get worse when her producer Kelly(the solid Timothy Olyphant), gets into the mix, and Matthew's perfect world starts to collapse. The film is a hodgepode of teen sex farce, romantic comedy, and parts where it tries to be serious and poignant. It's an odd mix, and they don't all gel. The direction and style, courtesy of Luke Greenfield, comes off like a new version of \\"Risky Business\\" for the new generation. It's a style that is sets it apart from some of it's kin, and is kind of refrshing. The leads are pretty good too. Emile Hirsch has a strong likeability factor, and you really do like him and want him to win. Elisha is a vision, and she is perfectly cast because she exudes the perfect fantasy girl you wished lived next door. Olyphant is equally engaging and funny to watch. Matthew's friends are funny comic reliefs aswell. The premise is obviously silly to the nth degree and is beyond plausible. But in movies like these, plausibility probably isn't the first thing on everyone's minds. While the decent acting and stylish direction is most welcome, it still can't hide the fact that the movie is raunchy, and is indeed a teen sex fiasco with some fancier coating. If it's not your thing, this won't grab you. If you are open to anything, or to this type of film, you might be surprised.
B00003CXCT|4.0|Well, well, well. The Lucas Merchandising Machine finally released all three \\"original\\" Star Wars films out on DVD. How does it look? Pretty darned good, Lucas' crew cleaned up the film quite a bit and the sound has been digitally remastered. Looks great and sounds great. <br /> <br />Star Wars purists may be unhappy since these are the \\"new\\" versions of the trilogy, not the original theatrical releases. I am just glad to have a version on DVD since my old VHS copy is barely viewable. If you \\"must have\\" these movies on DVD, then this collection is for you. <br /> <br />If you don't buy this collection now, don't worry. Another version will most likely come out after the 3rd \\"new\\" Star Wars film is out in theatres.
B00003CXCT|1.0|Man George WTF man why would to Frell up your own work like that  <br />Ok the added Jaba's seen in episode 4 I could deal with but the added dance seen in Jedi and changing the ending showing party's on other planets realy they did now hear of the news that fast and there still under empire control they were not boogieing and shooting off fire works its not like Ewok's  had long-range communication the only thing worse you could have done is put Walkie talkies  in the hands of the storm troupers like in the re-release of ET some one take this mans camera and send him a copy of sassier or anti CG script please  <br /> <br /> <br />
B0001YRVN4|1.0|Im rating this DVD set a 1, not the Star Wars movies, which obviously, rate a 5. Lucas thought it'd be fun to go back and see how much more he could ruin in the movies that he didnt already mess up in the special edition. I bought these thinking I was going to get the original, or at the worst, the special edition. In fact, it got even WORSE than that. He edited MORE things, totally messing up the movie. The longer I watched, the more I wanted to take out the dvd and snap it in two. I hope someday he realizes that we just want to see the original movies, not the abominations he has turned them into.
0062502182|1.0|I find trash like \\"The Alchemist\\" to be guilty as the impetus of social decreptitude in the modern world. I do not find it difficult to malign a book that advocates utter greed and contempt for life and that does so with a 100 page heap of cliched crap. A novel that lauds the choice to leave loved ones in search of personal, monetary gain, \\"The Alchemist\\" left with me with a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach.
B00003CXCT|4.0|Okay, I will say this up front to all devoted Star Wars fans like me who anxiously waited for this release on DVD, you will probably be disappointed with the changes that were made to movies. Even though the changes did not affect the main story line, they take away the sense of nostalgia that one might have for the original version. George Lucas said he wanted viewers to see the trilogy the way he intended it to be seen. To a certain extent I can understand where he's coming from, but many fans (like T.M.)wanted to see this movie in it's original form, with  only enhancements to the picture and sound quality.   Let's start off with the first noticeable  but necessary change.  The change was made in Empire Strikes Back, to the scene when Darth Vader communicates to his Master Darth Sidious. This is the scene where viewers get to see Darth Sidious for the first time in the trilogy. The original Sidious looked nothing like the Sidious we all know in Return of the Jedi. Lucas replaced the original Sidious with the Sidious in Return of The Jedi without changing the dialogue much.   The second noticeable and unwelcomed change for me is in Return of The Jedi, the scene where Princess Leia and Lando go to rescue Hans Solo from Jabba the Hutt. The original puppet that sings in Jabba's Palace was replaced by a computer generated image of the puppet and the original song was replaced with a diferent song that is sung as a duet. This change took away the feel of the original movie in a big way for me (Try to picture computer generated Muppets on Sesame Street and you'll understand what I'm trying to say).  The third obvious change was made to ending of Return of The Jedi.  The celebration song was replaced with another song, and the scene where Luke sees the Ghost Images of Yoda, Obi Wan, and Anakin was changed. In the original, they show Anakin as he may have looked had he not been consumed by the dark side, and in the DVD, they show Anakin's ghost as he looked before he turned to the dark side. I guess Lucas wanted the audience to remember Anakin as he was before he turned to the dark side. I personally would rather have the audience remember Anakin as the good guy turned bad, then turn good again.  There were other changes made to the Trilogy, but the ones mentioned here were the most noticable ones.    As far as the Technical Specifications are concerned, here's where the wait was worth it! The sound is presented in English Dolby 5.1 Surround EX, English Dolby 2.0 Surround, Spanish Dolby 2.0 Surround, French Dolby 2.0 Surround. Subtitles are in English.   I have the Enhanced Widescreen version for 16:9 TVs.    I watched all three movies with the sound set on Dolby 5.1 Surround Ex. George Lucas, I must thank you for doing the sound portion of the Trilogy justice. The sound quality is awsome. The 5.1 surround really did add a needed dimension to the Trilogy. It seemed kind of awkward watching and listening to Episode I and II with all the digital quality and then watching the VHS versions of Episodes IV, V, and VI with the original picture and sound.    Finally, this set is sold with a Bonus Material Disc with lots of special features. The most interesting being a behind the scene look at Episode III  in The Return of Darth Vader. This segment gives a little sneak peek at what Anakin will look like after he turns and it hints at a long Lightsaber Duel between Obi Wan and Anakin.  The Birth of the Lightsaber is also an intersting segment that talks about the lightsaber and some of the special effects used in the movies. The disc also gives a little sneak peek of a new X Box game for Episode III.  There is also Playable Demo of the game Battlefront.  In all, the bonus disc has over 4 hours of special features.     In conclusion, even with the changes that Lucas has made for the DVD, I recommend this Box set to all, old fans and new. The story remains the same with a few tolerable differences.  The big plus to the release is the Picture quality and surround sound quality.
B00003CXCT|5.0|There seems to be alot of whinning about the Special Edition versions and I just can't figure out why??? These versions are so much better. It just seems like a NO-BRAINER to me. Look, I was one of the biggest Star Wars fans in the world, I was 11 years old when A New Hope came out, and I stood in line to see it several times, I had all the toys, I had model kits(still do), collected bubble-gum cards and spent countless hours drawing every character known to the public. My point is...don't give me this traditionalist perspective, it just doesn't hold water. My kids love these movies and so do I! It's going to be even more of a tradition in 20 years. I say...GET A LIFE and enjoy the few blessings you have in this world!<br /><br />I thank the maker George decided to release it to DVD with the Special Edition versions.
0375507256|5.0|Ghostwritten and number9dream both offer an interesting story style I think is unqiue to David Mitchell. It all starts with an 1850s journey by boat to California then jumps to other times and characters including 1931 and 1970. The thread connecting all the times and charactres was the only element that didn't work for me. Otherwise a spectactular book.
B0002S94OS|5.0|This band straight up sucks. I just heard Laid to rest on headbangers ball. And so after listening to the entire cd i was even more disapointed Ive heard nothing but people rant and rave about this band and this is what they sound like?...They suck and obiviously so does anybody else that listens to this sh*t
B00000AFGM|3.0|Even though it's my least favorite Manson CD, this is still pretty good.  The messages behind the music and its lyrics are still great and still Manson, but it has a few problems.     1.) Under no circumstances buy this album if the only song you have heard off it is Rock is Dead. (As it is the only really heavy song here)    2.) I don't listen to a handful of songs given here.  There's too much filler.    3.) I was never a big fan of glam rock-ish music.  As a result it's hard for me to listen the whole way through.      In Antichrist Superstar era he had the role as the Worm transforming into the ACS.  Here Manson takes on two roles; a substance addicted glam rocker and an Alien without a true gender.  (I believe it is divided like that in the CD sleeve) They are the Alpha and the Omega.  Lyric-wise it revolves around bashing the entertainment/ magazine/ model industry, drugs, conformity, popularity, fame, etc. He makes great points in all of the songs and even though the lyrics are some of his best, it still doesn't beat Antichrist Superstar, Portrait of an American Family or Holy Wood (I have a hard time deciding which is my favorite).  Yet at the same time this is the record with the best music videos.  Check out the video for I Don't like the Drugs (But the Drugs Like Me).  That's actually a music video that actually works, tells a story and makes a point. (Same thing goes for the Dope Show)  The songs I like on Mechanical Animals are tracks 1-4, 9-11, 13 and 14.  Which leaves Disassociative, The Speed of Pain, Posthuman, I want to Disappear, and Fundamentally Loathsome as songs that make me have the urge to press the skip button from time to time.  It's hard for me to listen the whole way through without becoming bored or feeling the urge to play something else.  Like I said, I don't like Glam Rock-ish music, most of what I listen to is stuff like Slayer.   So, Just keep in mind that this is different then the average Manson, it isn't a surprise of how fans reacted to this when it first came out.  But then again no Manson album is the same and I doubt it ever will be.  It's what keeps Manson and friends Fresh.      Even If you don't agree with my Review so far, You should find this interesting.  There is an obsession with the number 15 throughout Mechanical Animals.  Like for instance if you look at the cover, Manson has 6 fingers on his left hand, thus we have 6=1+5.  (The left hand is also thought of as the Inferior/devil hand in Catholicism) The number also appears several times throughout the lyrics booklet, there is the song New Model No. 15.  There is a secret audio track that you can access through your computer; thus we have 15.  In I Don't Like the Drugs (But the drugs Like Me) there's the line \\"Ready for our 15 minutes of shame\\".  The record was released on September 15th 1998.  On the album Cover Marilyn Manson is spelled MAR1LYN MAN5ON.  Manson's birthday is January 5th (1-5).  15 is the Devil Tarot card.  On the Omega Symbol there are 15 squares on Manson's head.  the number 15 also means a conflict of opposites.  There is a lot more about it through various sites on the internet.  Also if your take the blue CD case and place it over the sleeve, you can read secret messages (lyrics to the 15th track) that are printed in yellow.  Well I Hoped this helped, and while it is my least favorite Marilyn Manson record, It still is a great one.      On an Additional Note: Zim Zum, the Live guitarist for Antichrist Superstar, was kicked out of/left the band because either A) he wanted to leave and go on his own or B) they kicked him out because he had trouble remembering how to play the songs and he never showed up for practice.  Or it was both.  As a result 8 of these songs are written By Zim Zum and 6 are written by Twiggy (the Bass Player), Zim Zum's replacement was John 5.
B0002VC924|5.0|I fear the importance of this film will be dismissed by many as joke. It is a courageous work. Buy it.
B0001BKAEY|2.0|**1/2 \\"The Matrix Revolutions\\" is the much-anticipated conclusion to the Wachowski Brothers' cultic sci-fi trilogy, whose previous entries were \\"The Matrix\\" and \\"The Matrix Reloaded.\\"  In the series' final installment, the messiah figure, Neo, does battle with the diabolical forces that have imprisoned most of humanity in a world of cyber unreality via a massive computer program known as The Matrix.<br /><br />Of the three films, \\"Revolutions\\" is definitely the least imaginative and the least interesting.  What separated the first two episodes in the series from most other action films was the willingness on the part of the filmmakers to bring some thematic depth and narrative complexity to a genre that, all too often, finds no room for such qualities.  The previous two films didn't always succeed in their endeavor - often emerging as more hollow and pretentious than meaningful and profound - but they managed to remain intriguing even in their moments of failure.  Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for \\"Revolutions,\\" which spends so much time on repetitive action scenes and special effects that there is little time left over for storyline and theme.  In a strange way, Neo himself ends up getting lost in this film, dropping off the radar screen for astonishingly long stretches of time, only to re-emerge periodically to remind us that there really is supposed to be a purpose buried somewhere beneath all this ear-splitting commotion (this could be re-titled \\"Finding Neo\\").  The sad fact, though, is that, once we arrive at the climactic scene to which all three films have been building, the resolution turns out to be a ham-handed muddle, utterly lacking in clarity and coherence  After an almost six-hour-long buildup over the course of the three films, the audience is left scratching its collective head wondering just what it was that happened before the closing credits started rolling by.  Perhaps smarter people than I can figure all this out for, frankly, after the overall disappointment occasioned by this film, I couldn't muster either the desire or the effort to probe very deeply into the matter.<br /><br />It goes without saying that the special effects in this film are spectacular - we would expect nothing less - but what we don't get from \\"Revolutions\\" - which we did from the two previous \\"Matrix\\" films - is that little something extra in the form of intelligence and sophistication that made them more than just the bland, over-produced, assembly-line products they easily could have become - and which \\"Revolutions\\" very nearly is.  Even the stolid earnestness of Keanu Reeves can't convince us this time around that there is anything hidden under all those cool gadgets and explosions worth our looking into.<br /><br />Thus endeth the Matrix series, not with a bang but with a whimper - intellectually speaking that is.he overall disappointment occasioned by this film, I couldn't muster either the desire or the effort to probe very deeply into the matter. <br /> <br />It goes without saying that the special effects in this film are spectacular - we would expect nothing less - but what we don't get from \\"Revolutions\\" - which we did from the two previous \\"Matrix\\" films - is that little something extra in the form of intelligence and sophistication that made them more than just the bland, over-produced, assembly-line products they easily could have become - and which \\"Revolutions\\" very nearly is.

0062502182|4.0|Sometimes it takes the most simplest of things to make us open our eyes to images and truths that are already present in our lives.  I started reading this book, got half way through it and put it down.  I didn't pick it up again for a week and a half.  I wasn't bored with the book or even disinterested in it, I simply left it to marinate in my head for a while. Once I picked it up again, I was unable to put it down.  I took it everywhere with me until I finished it.  The last couple of pages made me smile and reflect on my own life.   <br /> <br />Yes, the book is short and may be simple to some, but if you are stuck in a rut trying to search for answers to where your journey in life will lead you, this book is for you.  The story and the mission will stay with you for a long time....maktub.
0393035158|5.0|Mr. Sam Harris has beautifully articulated what I have known in a visceral, gut-level way since I was 15 years old (I'm now 50). I hope his book encourages people to start talking rationally about this utterly devisive thing called \\"faith\\". <br /> <br />Mr. Harris even targets me. I'm one of those \\"moderates\\" or \\"liberals\\" who has thought it best to be tolerant about everybody's diverse views on religion -- or what it's really about, our fear of death. In the modern age with WMDs so readily available and a reason-based dialog about faith so unacceptable, I truly fear there may be no future for my 5 year old son.  <br /> <br />To that end, I agree with Mr. Harris completely that it's time to get off the sidelines and speak honestly about the lunacy and irrationality of religions. I don't claim to know \\"truth\\"; but that's just the point, none of the rest of you do either. Let's start talking civilly and deliberatively about what we do know so that, just maybe, we can build a sustainable human society of the future. <br /> <br />Thank you to anyone who took the time to read these comments. <br /> <br />Paul Tucker <br /> <br />McAllen, TX <br />
B0002J4X1Q|4.0|So yeah, this movie basically has very little to do with the Resident Evil game series we all know and love. Granted, there are zombies. Lots of zombies. And zombie dogs. And there is *a* licker. No tyrants. Boo. But, we can't have everything jammed into one movie, can we? <br /> <br />Basic plot is that the Umbrella underground lab known as \\"The Hive\\" has had an outbreak of the T-virus, and everyone was killed. Milla Jovovich 's character awakes with no memory of what has happened, and is forced by Umbrella-sent commandos into the Hive to see what went on down there. Chaos ensues. <br /> <br />Milla did a decent bit of acting in this movie. Granted, the outfit was an obvious ploy to get fanboy response, but oh well. Eric Mabius did an excellent job as supporting lead, especially towards the end. (god bless those candid muscle shots) Michelle Rodriguez was also very believable in her performance. <br /> <br />So, if you've got a free afternoon and need some decent entertainment in terms of action, suspense, and zombie-popping fun, go for this flick. It's not like the games, but I guess we'll have to gag and bind Paul Anderson for him to do a *real* Resident Evil film.
B0002OERI0|5.0|To whom it may concern: <br />If you can't write a coherent review, don't write a review.  <br /> <br />To everyone that gave this record less than two stars: <br />Do us all a favor and stop writing reviews. <br />  <br />I give this record five stars. <br /> <br />P.S. It's suburbia not seburbia.
B00005JLEU|5.0|\\"Spirited Away\\" is the only Miyazaki film I've had the good fortune to see in the theaters. After winning an Academy Award, the movie enjoyed a re-run. I hadn't heard much about it, other than the occasional television ad, where even the briefest snippet of the film convinced me this was something I had to see.     Sitting in the theater, I felt like a child. The animation is superlative. Every bit of color and texture jumps out at one. The care which which this film was made is absolutely astounding!    Miyazaki's dream-like story follows a young girl, Chihiro, moving to a new town with her parents. Her father, on the way to their new home, mis-directs them, and the family finds themselves at a failed amusement park, where the parents decide to explore, much to Chihiro's dismay.    After wandering a bit, the parents find a food stall filled to overflowing with freshly cooked delicacies. They tuck in immediately, but Chihiro won't have anything to do with it. As the sun sets, a startling thing happens, and Chihiro finds herself in a world populated by spirits. She alone can save her parents and return them - along with herself - to the world she is used to.    Miyazaki's movies tend to have a dream-like quality to them, with the possible exception of \\"Princess Mononoke\\" (at least, the Miyazaki films I have seen so far). \\"Spirited Away\\" is definitely no exception, being the most dream-like of them all. While all the occurrences in the story don't always make sense in an everyday sort of way, Chihiro's experiences in the spirit world are easy enough to relate to.    There is just so much going on in this film: Chihiro's sense of loneliness, the unpredictable nature of the spirits she meets, the different laws that apply to the spirit world. \\"Spirited Away\\" is an assault on the senses from start to finish.    I highly recommend watching the film both in the dubbed English and then in the subtitled Japanese. The differences that the characters' tone of voice convey aredelightful. This is most notable in the character of Yubaba, voiced beautifully in the English by Suzanne Pleshette (and by Nina Hagen in the German version....her daughter, Cosma Shiva, plays Lin, Chihiro's boss at the bathhouse).    A must see for all fans of Miyazaki's work.
B00005JNEI|5.0|The real point of Michael Moore's documentary is that the mainstream media missed 90% of the story about 911.  They showed Bush hugging a fireman and refused to ask the tough questions.  Whether you are conservative or liberal, Democrat or Republican, this is a must see.  In the feel good atmosphere of the post-911 days, when everyone was an American it was the responsibility of the media to go beyond the ribbons, flags, pomp, and circumstance, and report the news.  They failed miserably.  The media has willingly handed over their \\"watchdog\\" role and it is up to those like Moore to get behind the scenes and ask the questions.  The fact that it is hilarious only adds to the film's appeal.
0553213105|5.0|Jane Austen obviously chose the titles to her novels with care, for this book truly is about pride and prejudice, explored through the eyes of the book's main character: Elizabeth Bennett, as well as the rest of the Bennett family, Elizabeth's best friend Charlotte and the upper crust families with which they rub shoulders.<br /><br />Set in the England of King George III, \\"Pride\\" details Elizabeth's coming of age and her exploration of her own romantic nature. As the second eldest of five daughters, and most beloved of her father, Elizabeth is used to being the quickest wit around, and fancies herself an expert of human nature. When Elizabeth finds herself sought after by several men, consecutively, she finds perhaps she isn't quite the expert she'd believed herself to be.<br /><br />Austen is a master of character study, and \\"Pride\\" is certainly no exception, being the finest example of her work. While a romance novel in earnest, Austen never hesitates to ruffles feathers with her quick wit.<br /><br />Characters such as Lady Catherine de Bourgh, Mr. Collins, and Lucas family and, of course, all the Bingleys, provide an excellent assortment of personalities and conflict that Elizabeth must navigate in order to remain true to her nature and find her position in English society of the time.<br /><br />Herself the daughter of a clergyman, Austen was no stranger to the lifestyle of which she wrote, and \\"Pride\\" provides excellent insight into her time.
B00005ASGG|4.0|In my opinion, this is one of the first non-traditional westerns. It is dark and complex.  The death of an outlaw goes far from making everything right in the town of Shinbone.  Life is rarely simple and TMWSLV is more legitimate than your average Hollywood fantasy due to its realistic mood.<br /><br />John Wayne outshines all of the other stars onscreen.  Every time he's on camera viewers will be appreciative.  Yes, he is/was a man's man, but in this film he's far more man than legend.  One cannot help but identify with him which is not the case when the heros of film have more steel than blood in their veins.<br /><br />Lee Marvin plays a creative and intriguing vilain but the James Stewart character was a letdown.  This is some serious overacting indeed.  Stewart has to be one of the most annoying \\"heroes\\" in the history of filmmaking.  He is a self-righteous characture of a good man and his portrayal is the only reason I can think of as to why this movie will strike some as being dated.  We no longer, the general population that is, think of lawyers as being a bastion of truth, goodness or justice. Nevermind though, the rest of the cast and plot shine.
B00004ZD69|5.0|After giving up my search for some good music that could be described as \\"progressive rock\\" and done by a band that still tours and doesn't have to worry about \\"reissues\\" for another 20 years, I came across these guys and gals that make up Godspeed You Black Emperor!. I've regared most prog rock as taking what was popular at the time and taking it one step further, past the boundaries of pretentiousness and making music that sounded good (for the most part) and could last for 20 minutes, and didn't sound like anything one has heard before.  Well I think that this band passes this criteria.  They combine shreds of popular noise-rock and dare I say it.....a hint of \\"emo\\" and graph it onto a mourning mass of lush orchestral strings that wail, moan, and hum beautifully along with the multiple guitars, basses, and drums.  Did I say that they also use tape loops of insane preachers and nostalgic old men? Their interesting viewpoints really add to the mood of the song, and convey the state of the world today.   <br />Sure, this band is pretentious. I like pretentious! If it sounds good, they can be as pretentious as they like, and this is awesome! Sure, they have strong and radical political beliefs.  Well guess what? You don't have to believe in them!  I also listen to Frank Zappa, but just because I do doesn't mean that I totally agree with what he's saying. He just rocks, just like this band!  Don't waste time trying to listen to the half-hour ramblings of Transatlantic and the wimped-up Yes ripoffs of Spock's Beard, just get this CD and hear how well raw emotion can be relayed to you through a small hunk of plastic.  Don't succumb to the plastic pseudo-emotion of Story of the Year and Taking Back Sunday!  Just because Yellowcard has a violin doesn't mean that they utilize it well!  Hear classical music and rock and roll blended like they're supposed to!  Also leave Mogwai and Sigur Ros at the door before listening to this. This is the epitome of Post-Rock, and the Tales From Topographic Oceans of the 21st century!

B00006BTCA|4.0|The Joy Division influence is apparent but I think that it is a sound that was never fully explored before.  I always liked the general feeling of Joy Division but was bored by their music.  Interpol picks up that ball and runs with it.  The songs can be a little monotonous with the guitars often chugging along in a similar manner but there is enough variety to keep me interested.  Obstacle 1 and PDA are excellent pop with gritty guitars and stops and starts that surprise.  NYC and Stella have a more airy atmospheric feeling.  A great album; I look forward to the next.
0440180295|4.0|The cynicism and dark humor that runs rampant in this book is extrememly fitting for an antiwar novel. Vonnegut does a wonderful job in showing how detrimental the effects of war are on not only the people directly involved, but also on those around. His portrayl of Billy Pilgrim is fitting for those veteran who have been emotionally affected by war.  <br />Vonnegut's technique for writing the novel is different but not necessarily hard to follow. At times it may be confusing, but it mirrors Billy's new outlook on life as the Tralfamadorians view it: as a group of events that one can see all at once, like a mountain range. As the reader learns about Billy, his past, and his future, sympathy is envoked and the reader pities him for the horrific things that he has experienced.  <br />Overall, this book is a great narrative of the effects of war and how it can alter the mindset of those involved so closely. Vonnegut speaks from his own experiences so the account is semi-autobiographical and believable.
B00005JNEI|1.0|I will not go into what wrong with this movie slate.com did a much better piece on it that I could ever do, i saying that you should not trust Moore just like you should not trust ann coulter, both or insane people who dare not move outside the party-line , and sadly you got enough morons who just cause someone says something bad  about people with R next to their name that believe them immediately, the same goes with people who believe  immediately someone who says something bad about people with D next the name. People, ignore these idiots (moore, coulter, hannity, colbms rush, etc))
B000059QYB|4.0|When the mid-eighties needed a picture perfect rock star to help them keep an edge, the photogenic Billy Idol was exactly what they had in mind. Having slowly drifted from punk rock to pop punk, the Elvis lip curl and spiky hair suddenly transformed Billy from Generation-X footnote to International Stardom. It goes without saying that most of Idol's albums (save for \\"Rebel Yell\\") were typically average affairs, what really mattered were the hook laden singles. As soon as Idol and secret weapon super guitarist Steve Stevens figured out that lightning guitar licks and bubblegum catchy songs were their strongest suit, they were unstoppable.<br /><br />To that end, it's no surprise that Billy's first number one was the dancey remake of Tommy James' \\"Mony Mony,\\" or that his first Top 40 solo hit, \\"Hot In The City,\\" owes a considerable debt to the Loving Spoonful's \\"Summer In The City.\\" Billy was smart enough to match charm with his menace, and that meant \\"Dancing With Myself\\" and \\"White Wedding\\" were equal parts comic book dangerous to dance floor catchy. Idol and Stevens didn't limit themselves to the dance floor, either. \\"Rebel Yell\\" and \\"Cradle Of Love\\" kick serious butt, and the neo-balladry of \\"Flesh For Fantasy\\" and \\"Sweet Sixteen\\" showed a sensible and sensitive side.<br /><br />This \\"Greatest Hits\\" CD pretty much puts everything onto one disc (I prefer the studio version of \\"Mony Mony,\\" even if the live version was the American hit). The interesting inclusion of \\"LA Woman\\" (Billy had a small part in Oliver Stone's \\"The Doors\\" movie) and a remake of Simple Minds' \\"Don't You Forget About Me\\" are just gravy to the package. The price is right, as well! As a document of 80's hitmakers, \\"Billy Idol's Greatest Hits\\" is well above average.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Green Day is smart and I am glad that they are standing up against the idiots in this country.  I hate Bush and I hate all of his supporters.  I just don't see how anyone can support that jerk.  If he is re-elected he will turn it into a dictatorship.  I am tired of people saying they hate when someone makes Bush look like an idiot.  It isn't too hard to make Bush look like an idiot because he does a pretty good job himself!  Why doesn't he go back to Texas where he came from?  I can't stand the mainstream media with their lies and propaganda.  Also I hate the way the military uses manipulation and subliminal messages to try to get us to join.  I have been listening to alot of Green Day's music lately.  I think this album is an important album because it deals with important times for this country.  I am 19 so I can vote but i'm not because I believe voting is a currupt proccess.  Any alcoholics can go vote and it's ok so it's a waste of time.
0316286850|2.0|Kevyn aucoin was definately an artist, but I didn't like this book. The makeup he presents is too obvious and fake. The pictures are excellent but he offers little step by step advice. The makeovers are great, in pictures. I would be scared to find someone with that much makeup in the street. This book is certainly missing the real-life/real-makeup element. If he was the master behind so many great looks on celebrities (i.e. Gwyneth Paltrow), why didn't he show us how to achieve their natural but polished style? Maybe he didn't want to give his secrets away!!!
B0001BKAEY|3.0|This movie is a more satisfying experience to Matrix Reloaded. It has a sort of closure, even though it still feels ambiguous and vague.    The bulk of the action takes place in the &#34;real world&#34;. Much of it centres on the siege on Zion by the machines. Anyone searching for a quick &#34;bullet time&#34; fix will be sorely disappointed because as far as I can recall, there is only one.    &#60;Spoiler alert!&#62;    I have always thought that the explanation of how Neo and Smith came about to be so powerful and its &#34;inevitable&#34; resolution to have originate from the popular computer RPG series &#34;Ultima&#34;. In the last installment of this series, the hero, the virtuous &#34;Avatar&#34; found out that his mortal enemy of the last 3 games, The Guardian, was actually his evil twin after he had cast out his &#34;unclean&#34; personality after being proclaimed the Avatar back in the 4th installment of the game. For readers not being familiar with the game, do a little google search on this, and read the sypnosis of the whole series, you will find that the Matrix trilogy and the Ultima game series share plenty of similarities, with only the context being different. What an utter rip-off, I was so disappointed that the Wachowski brothers could come up with such a hackeyned plot that a teenage computer nerd could dream up.    &#60;end spoliers&#62;    All that's being said, the 2 disc edition is adequate. In terms of extras, there are plenty of featurettes to mull over and the picture quality is surprisingly clean and free from grains. For a mere $12 a pop, I would say it's a good buy, unless of course you are saving up for the ultimate edition.
0312932081|5.0|This is another one of those books that I've always meant to read but never found the right time.  When I finally got around to it (years later) my only regret is that I waited so long to enjoy this terrific book.  I'll admit to having a certain affinity for sci-fi and thus found the entire premise of \\"Ender's Game\\" to be entertaining.  Ender Wiggin is one of many child geniuses genetically bred to command the world's military armada against alien invaders.  In Battle School these children are trained through an arduous series of stimulated mock battle games where only the best and ablest can succeed.  But Ender Wiggin is no ordinary trainee.  He is thought to be the one who may become the ultimate commander who will bring final victory over the aliens.  And, of course, all the while Ender is going through his training sinister and benevolent forces work relentlessly behind the scenes to thwart and support his efforts.    In addition to this engaging storyline, author Orson Scott Card touches upon several thought-provoking themes: the yearning for a childhood lost; the psychological fear and loneliness of command; the morality of exterminating an alien race; and, ultimately, how the inability to communicate led to catastrophic consequences.  I especially liked the ending where Ender and the readers are left to contemplate the morality and humanity of this war.  Not a heavy read but a thoroughly enjoyable one.
B00005N7Z1|3.0|This is the R-rated theatrical cut that is being sold everywhere since its release on home video format. From VHS to LD and now to DVD! <br /> <br />MGM had the cojones to release this truncated version knowing full well that consumers are still going to buy it anyway because it's the first and best robocop movie. If you don't mind spending a little more, get the whole robocop trilogy boxset, that's where the unrated version resides. If you just want the unrated version of this movie, I suggest you either: <br /> <br />1. Wait for another MGM reissue (MGM sure loves doing this! Look at Raging Bull and Fargo) <br /> <br />2. Get the Criterion Collection title from eBay or Amazon marketplace. It may be a little pricey, but it's a good buy, just from its cover. <br /> <br />3. Get the UK region 2 DVD from Amazon UK. Before doing that, make sure your DVD player is region free. (Come on, why restrict yourself to a certain region? Enjoy the best of both worlds!)
B00003CXCT|5.0|When the STAR WARS \\"Special Editions\\" were released theatrically back in 1997, it was a given that they would be released in DVD a few months later.  Instead, they were released in VHS only and rumors were that Lucas was going to release the original trilogy in DVD format only after the second trilogy (Episodes 1-3) was completed. There were grumblings from the fan base that Lucas was being greedy in which it forces people to buy the trilogy twice or three times. Also, many from the fan base do not like Lucas \\"tweaking\\" the films. To paraphrase Lucas in the \\"Special Edition\\" interviews (VHS versions) \\"A director never completes a film, a director merely abandons it.\\" That's how he felt about STAR WARS and Lucas wanted to complete the films to his vision. When one thinks about it, he's not changing any story plotlines, but just adding a few things visually because of time and money constraints back when the movies were being filmed and to take advantage of the CGI age. Also, as it is shown on those VHS-Special Edition Interviews, the negative of the original film was all ready deteriorating in such a short period of time, and part of the tweaking was to save the film for future generations. Lastly, the further tweaking in the DVD releases are to enhance the bridge between the first trilogy and the next trilogy. Whatever Lucas' intent, it's his films, and he should be able to do what he wants to do with them. Now that the original trilogy is on DVD.  The DVD's have no indication of being the \\"Special Edition\\" versions from the 1997 re-release, but these are the versions with the changes (and there are even a few more surprises included).  Therefore, this is the definitive Lucas versions (at least for now). However, grumblings should subside because the films look great and Lucas didn't wait until the second trilogy was completed --or at least the final/3rd installment was released (it's probably completed but in post production and editing--also it is a marketing ploy to promote the film being released in May 2005). Overall, just watch and have fun.  Don't let the minor additives be a distraction, because the overall dynamics and spirit of the films are left intact. Note: A highlight that still thrills this reviewer...When Han Solo/Chewbacca unexpectedly come back (with a great shot of the Milennium Falcon flying in) to help Luke during the Death Star battle scene in \\"A NEW HOPE\\".to promote the film being released in May 2005).

B0002OERI0|5.0|This cd is definitely one of the best punk cds out this year, and most likely THE best. This, in my opinion, is Green Day's best work so far. There are some hard rocking songs on this cd (American Idiot, St. Jimmy, Holiday,...) and there are some softer, more mellow Time of your Life type songs (Wake Me uP When September ends, Boulevard of Broken Dreams). But definitely my new favorite cd. I think anyone who likes Green Day, or even just punk in general should buy this cd without a second thought. Oh and just a note, there aren't 21 songs on the cd, #2 and #12 are broken into different parts (it's hard to explain until you've heard it for yourself.) SO GO BUY IT AND HEAR FOR YOURSELF!!!!!!!!!

B0002Z9HT8|2.0|I was really excited to learn that Live Aid would finally be released comercially. Musically, it was one of the defining events of our lifetime. But when I heard it was going to be released on four DVDs I was suspicious that we would not get the entire concert - that songs would be deleted. A review of the track list shows that lots of stuff has been cut - and not just from the performances of lesser acts. Madonna (noted above), Sting (Driven to Tears), Duran Duran (View to a Kill). There's no Power Station, no Santana (performing with Pat Metheny)...  Phil Collins played longer sets in both London and Philly but here we get only one song per location... <br /> <br />Then there's the issue of timing. Why is Judas Priest on Disc 4 (after the UK finale) when they played in London in the morning after Bryan Ferry? Kenny Loggins played in Philly after Tom Petty, but here he appears about four hours earlier in the set... And so on <br /> <br />Guess I'll need to hold on to my aging video tapes after all!
0393057658|5.0|I'm not a sports book reader generally, but a friend recommended this one and it is truly outstanding.  It's more of a business book than a sports book, focusing on the market inefficiency in baseball created by old-timers using intuition about how to draft and trade players.   <br /> <br />It follows a great story line about the Oakland A's, who with 1/3 of the budget of the top spenders routinely finish up near the top, by taking a more statistically based approach to selecting players and spending their budget.  It reads like a novel though, in part because Lewis is a good writer, and in part because of the material (Billy Beane, Oakland's GM, in particular is a character). <br /> <br />I enjoyed it thoroughly -- it heightened my interest in baseball, and it made me look at markets in general with an eye towards seeking inefficiencies and opportunities in a new light. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00003CXCT|5.0|I already have 3 other Star Wars VHS sets and was thinking of passing on the DVDs. After seeing the quality of these movies at a friend's I went out and bought them. I am a huge Empire Strikes Back fan and the price is worth it just for this movie. Lucas did an incredible job restoring ESB and ROTJ (but not Star Wars) to the point where it looks like these two films were shot yesterday. There is a HUGE difference in sound/picture quality between VHS and DVD, I felt like I was 6 years old again watching Empire for the first time. I'm actually happy with the changes as it will make older trilogy fit in better with the new trilogy. I give Lucas two thumbs up for the amount of work he put into improving these movies. Thank you for making me a Star Wars fan again!!
B0002IQAN6|5.0|The Fillmore Concerts that came out in the 90's was actually \\"corrected\\" from the spliced versions of the original, to include the full, uncut versions. It pretty much is a different album altogether from the first. Both are great, but many would consider the first release to be the definitive and \\"best\\" version. There is no grave rolling or shame in releasing this greatest live album of all time in SACD.

Also the soul reason for this movie is to make us ASK QUESTIONS, of our leaders, who by the way have not answered.

0618001905|4.0|Near the end of the 1800's much of Europe was discovering the untapped natural resources of Africa, and expanding their colonial reach into the Dark Continent.  King Leopold of Belgium, unhappy with his small kingdom and dimished role as king, sought to create a colony anywhere he could.  He used the famed explorer Stanley to claim the area known as the Congo as his own personal colony.  He initially exploited it for ivory, and later for rubber, using forced labor (slavery) among the native peoples to build his own personal wealth.  Although he never set foot there himself, he profited immensely while brutally suppressing the natives and forcing them to work for him, causing the deaths of an estimated 10 million people over about 25 years.  At the same time he portrayed himself as a great humanitarian to the rest of the world.  Eventually, however, word began to come out of the atrocities committed in the Congo.  Leopold waged public relations campaigns to discredit his detractors, but eventually several mistakes led to a great public outcry and he eventually sold the Congo to Belgium.<br /><br />The author does a very good job of pulling all available sources together, a difficult task since much of the documentation was destroyed.  The brutality and cruelness employed by the Europeans is discussed at length and in appropriate detail.  He discusses the attitudes and hypocricy prevalent at the time, but doesn't ignore the fact that slavery was a long-standing practice among Africans.  He also examines the successes and failings of the movement to free the Congo, the first sustained human-rights campaign in history.  This book is very enlightening about an area and period of history that has long been ignored and covered up, to the point where few remember what happened.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Groundbreaking documentary that is a real eye opener for anyone who believes in the truth and in what this country should stand for. Michel Moore's film is a masterpiece and it would go down as the most groundbreaking and truthful eye of what this country has turn into under the Bush government.

B00003CXCT|5.0|Star wars will forever be a classic for any generation and a blueprint for films to follow. George Lucas'  <br />Original Trilogy is a breathtaking joyride that is memorable from beginning to end.  The second installment in the series (the Empire Shrikes Back) is widely considered to be the greatest sequel of all times and it does deserve that praise. It took the series to new heights and established the series as more than popcorn films and put in into cinematic legend. The Dvd collection is nothing short of brilliant and the extras are spectacular. I can't recommend it more than I already did. <br /> <br />Get it.  <br />
B0002QXAD6|5.0|I bought Nightwish's Once cd from their site when it came out a couple months ago, and I still love it. Nightwish really brings alive their songs. There is just so much energy on this cd. My personal favourites off this cd will have to be, 'Wish I Had An Angel', 'Ghost Love Score', 'Nemo', 'Creek Mary's Blood', and 'Planet Hell'... Actually I love the whole cd. And all I have to say to those who say that Nightwish isn't metal anymore, Nightwish can be whatever they wanna be. They are Nightwish and always will be Nightwish. After listening to this cd over and over again I can tell that Nightwish really put alot of hard work on this cd. And if people don't like the new Nightwish cd, oh well, it's their loss. Because Nightwish isn't really losing any fans, they are gaining fans. So yeah, this cd pretty much owns.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Brilliant, superb, overwhelming, exceeding all expectations - that is how I would describe GD's new album, \\"Americn Idiot\\". Realeased at the most appropriate time, with all-appropriate lyrics to go with it, it's got the punch like no other! Forget about Dookie, Insomniac and Warning - American Idiot will take you to the heights you've never knew existed! Billie Joe is mature, grown up and phenominal! This album is clearly many, many, many levels above the rest. Kind of makes you think it would be very hard for them to top it off in the future.
B00005JMJG|4.0|Eternal Sunshine is an impossible film to try to surmise, because it is an incredibly complex story that, when you try to relate it to someone, makes perfect sense to you but probably comes out sounding like you have absolutely NO idea what you are talking about.   <br /> <br />I will try to do it justice in this very short recap.  Joel is recovering from a breakup from his girlfriend Clementine.  The pain is mounting, when he runs into his former love and is further jarred by her inability to show him the slightest recognition.  She isn't just giving him the cold shoulder:  she has no concept who he is.  Through a mixup, Joel discovers Clementine has had him 'erased' from her memory, and he figures this to be a terrific remedy for his heartbreak.  He discovers, during the erasing process, that some memories should stay, and he and the Clementine of his mind work desperately to hide her by incorporating her into other memories of his. The way the story weaves past and present is complicated but engaging. <br /> <br /> <br />What this movie does BRILLIANTLY examine is what happens to the good memories if we throw out the bad, and how intricately both are woven together.  It also questions how important are experiences we live through in terms of our destiny?  Can we really 'erase' those who fate has put in our paths?  Are the bad memories worth erasing if it means the good go with it?  These are very interesting questions 'Eternal' poses.   <br /> <br />And I doubt any other actor could have served 'Eternal' well as Joel.  Carrey gives a career best performance as the heartbroken Joel, and it's a performance filled with perfectly nuanced pain.  It's just captivating how Carrey gives Joel a desperation that is never whiney or pathetic.  He's just a man broken by love and looking for the quickest way out of it. <br /> <br />Winslet proves she is one of the most talented actresses of her generation in a performance that makes a fairly annoying character palatable and easy to relate to.  Her Clementine would be far less easy to like in the hands of a less skilled actress, but Winslet brings a relatable bond to Clem that is not simple for such a harsh character. <br /> <br />
B0000CFW87|5.0|Gosh, I can't say enough about Josh Groban.  What a classy, talented, and quite handsome human being.  When so many other young musicians stoop as low as they can go, Groban keeps the bar high.  This CD has a great variety of styles (and languages!).  Although I love them all, \\"Remember When It Rained\\" is probably my favorite.  And guess what?  His voice is as beautiful in real life as it is on the CD!
B0001I55OC|1.0|It's not often that a movie comes out that has good costumes and sets, and a fun idea and then is totally ruined by the worst acting you have ever seen.  Not one... Not two... But ALL the actors were horrible.  They even forget their accents often.  Richard Donner should be ashamed.  Don't waste your Timeline on this stinker.
B00003CXCT|3.0|agree on the edit with anakin at the end of Episode 6.  It actually screws up the point of Luke \\"saving\\" his father.  I guess George was attempting to link the old and new movies, but young anakin with old ben and old yoda makes no sense.  For a new viewer, it may imply that darth vadar's history is erased and that anakin lives on in the force as a young man.  having aged and re-joining the light side was the importance.  plus, i always thought the actor who played old anakin got the shaft. <br /> <br />more bothersome to me was the re-do of the emperor/vadar conference on the star destroyer.  the image of the empereor is redone with the actor who plays him in 1-3, 6 but the dialogue changed again.  George again changed the context of the scene and makes it look like Vadar is not aware of Luke, which he should have been.   <br /> <br />And what is with vadar's dialogue after the episode 5 duel with Luke?  \\"Bring my shuttle\\" was fine.  \\"Alert my SD...\\" doesnt even sound like James Earl Jones.  Why was that necessary? <br /> <br />What reallly bothers me about the edits and redos is that Lucas is changing the story.  CGI is fine to ENHANCE it but dont rewrite history, George.
0893815187|1.0|This is the second time I have to put a review into this page (the first one got lost or removed). <br /> <br />This book is nothing more than some snapshot in a family album.  The photographs, sometimes blurred, not well taken; and on top of that, printed in small format.  I imagine anyone with a $200 camera should be able to snap shots as artistic as those in here.  Overall, I am very disappointed with this book.  I just don't know how others could write a positive review of this book. <br />
B00005JMJ4|3.0|If you want to capture my outlook on this movie, here's what you have to do.  First, have everybody tell you it is the cinematic achievement of the century.  Second, have everybody tell you it is a stirring encapsulation of the contemporary human condition.  Third, watch \\"Rabbit Proof Fence\\".  Then, after you've come to terms with what legitimate hardships forced upon people look like, it will be time to reflect on \\"Lost in Translation\\".  Hmmm.  How much do you care that rich, white people feel lonely and misunderstood?  Are you riveted by their boredom, self-obsession, and deep yearning for novelty?  Perfect.  Give it five stars.  Personally, I found it ironic that this movie might have been the very cure for insomnia that they were looking for. <br /> <br />I give it three stars for visual originality, length, and the subtle ending - defying formulaic convention until the very end.
0783240503|5.0|I rented this movie through the library.  I wanted to see what it was like.  I fell in love with Donny Osmond as Joseph.  I also really liked Maria Freidman as the Narator.  She had a very strong voice for the role, and sounded better than anyone else that I have heard.  I love the music, and I love the costumes, and the stage sets.  I give this movie a five star rating and can't wait for Andrew Lloyd Weber to make a movie of Phantom. If he does, It better have Michael Crawford as the Phantom, cause otherwise I will not be buying it.
B00005JLD4|5.0|An excellent movie: well-paced, well-acted, well-told.  A disturbing story that will leave you morose and contemplative on issues of injustice.  The DVD documentary tells you that the main characters are portrayed by three young aboriginal girls with no previous acting experience.  The performances are riveting.  It gives pause to think that they were able to pull it off without commanding $20M salaries! <br /> <br />In all, a film I heartily recommend.  You will definitely be touched.
B000001FOL|5.0|With a tremble in her gorgeously stoic voice, and a heart both heavy and whimsically searching, Nico burst onto the scene fully solo, yet somehow beneath the radar. <br />Though her later works would prove the true breadth of her special talents, there is something eerie, lovable, and unforgettable about these songs both passionate and subdued, in their smoothe flute/guitar/string arrangements, drumless, and utterly haunting. <br />Covering, as she would not often do again, the songs of others ranging from Loud Reed and John Cale, to Bob Dylan, to Jackson Browne, she intones visions of hesitation, hope, embracing of death, effortlessly, and as though each subject holds something within, just as sweet, uptempo, or downtrodden. <br />The longest tracks, the stark \\"It Was A Pleasure Then\\" and the sarcastic rendering of life among \\"superstars\\" in Andy Warhol's circle, \\"Chelsea Girls\\", are the first, sonically experimental, and somehow midevally beautiful and resonant both. <br />The last solemn track \\"Eulogy To Lenny Bruce\\" is a chilling and mournfully pensive look upon one of those whom Nico admired most for honesty. <br /> <br />And honest this record is. <br /> <br />So honestly, buy it. And then proceed to delve further into her magnificent vision.
B00005JMAH|4.0|The first two books were short and the movie makers has no problem making film versions that included most of the books plot lines. As this book series goes along, they get quite long. The next two books are even longer.  There is no way the film makers will be able to include all the plot/scenes that are in the books. If they made The Prisoner of Azkaban, \\"by the book\\", it would have been a 4 hour + plus movie.  The movie studios will not permit that.  Expect the next film, \\"The Goblet of Fire\\" to be chopped even more than this one.  Movies are seldom as good as the books, so be prepared.   <br />If you watch \\"The Prisoner of Azkaban\\" and not compare it to the book, it really is a good film. I knew going in that they were going to have to change stuff and delete many plot lines, so I was happy it was a good as it was.
B00005JMJG|5.0|Notice how the reviews for this film are either 5 stars or 1 star.  That tells you a lot.  For people like me, movies are supposed to be an experience that you remember and relive and think about for a long time.  Movies like Lost in Translation, Brazil, the Swimmer, and now ESOTSM.  Yes, a Weekend at Bernie's once in a while, but movies like ESOTSM are what the art form is about in the first place.  For the people that gave this movie 1 star, movies are supposed to be like chewing gum, comic strips that you read and forget and other mindless pleasures.  So your opinion about this film really depends on what you are looking for in movies.   <br /> <br />The acting is great, the screenplay is imaginative and unpredictable, and if you think the plot is silly, ask yourself how many people would probably want to erase you from their memory if they could... <br />
B00003CXCT|5.0|Seven years after the Star Wars: Special Edition came out on VHS, the original trilogy finally arrives on DVD! I can say that the transfer from the original negatives into the DVD format is nothing short of amazing! The quality of the film is practically perfect, with none of the dust, grit, and other particles you'd see from most transfers into DVD. You could almost swear the trilogy was filmed digitally, because the colors you see looks amazingly vibrant, even in scenes where there's little color. The sound quality is amazing as well, though as with what some people noticed, the only quibbles I have (mainly in ANH), is some instances the sound channeling are positioned oddly, in one instance some dialogue sounds muffled (Tarkin's line: \\"You would prefer another target, a military target? Then name the system.\\", you'll see what I mean). Beyond that, those are my only quibbles sound-wise.<br /><br />As for the movies themselves, again, some changes were made to improve on what was added in when the Special Edition was released. In ANH, as Luke's landspeeder was entering Mos Eisley, more detail was made to the speeder and the occupants (ie: C-3P0) to make it more realistic. The Han/Greedo scene was changed somewhat to make it a much closer in shots and Han's reaction was more believable. Jabba was redone to look more like the Jabba in Episode I. The tractor beam display that Obi-Wan Kenobi shuts down was changed to \\"Imperial\\" writing, and finally the lightsaber blades were \\"rerotoscoped\\" in the Darth Vader/Obi Wan duel to be more consistent with the rest of the Star Wars movies. In ESB, the two I noticed the most was the Emperor was changed to Ian McDiarmid's portrayal, and the dialouge was changed a little. The other part was Temuera Morrison voice was put in for the small amount of dialogue (4 lines of it) that Boba Fett speaks...to be more consistent with the prequels. In ROTJ, the majority of the changes was near the end, as Sebastian Shaw (who played Anakin) doesn't have his eyebrows anymore when the mask was removed (which makes sense). Naboo is added in the celebrations, and the \\"Jedi ghost\\" of Hayden Christensen's Anakin replaces Sebastian Shaw's version. That last one might offend some diehard fans, but after thinking about it for a bit, it would make sense as far as continuity between the prequels and the originals are concerned.<br /><br />The bonus disk is a treat to see. My glaring complaint is that they didn't include deleted scenes that most fans like myself always wanted to see. In my case, I always wanted to see that Wampa attack scene in ESB (you see a smidgen of that deleted scene in the ESB trailer), but sadly, it isn't here. Despite that, I especially enjoyed seeing the \\"Empire of Dreams\\". I never knew how close to disaster A New Hope was from never even making the screen, and how much of an impact that movie (and the subsequent two) had made to the genre, the style of moviemaking, and visual effects for years to come. If none of the groundbreaking things never happened, hard to say if other movies that made an impact decades later (Lord of the Rings trilogy, Terminator 2, Titanic, etc.) would've turned out the way they did if it wasn't for what Skywalker Ranch, LucasArts, ILM, Pixar (yes, the same Pixar that brought about Toy Story and so on...), and THX have done to move the industry forward. And in addition, made a difference to those aspiring filmmakers that wanted to be independent from movie studios...as George Lucas is arguably the most successful independent movie filmmaker of our generation.<br /><br />After seeing the originals when I was a kid, it is amazing (I know, I use this line alot ;)) after nearly 30 years how much the movies look as good as they do today, and after the additions put in, how much better they now fit together with the prequels. Like or hate Lucas, he is and always will be a good storyteller. I hope that when Episode III comes out, that it will tie everything together and have that little bit of that \\"character\\" that the originals have, which the prequels are sorely lacking...well, Attack of the Clones was on the right track, but it still has a long way to go. At any rate, I will be looking forward to that series-tying arc May 2005. :)and have that little bit of that \\"character\\" that the originals have, which the prequels are sorely lacking...well, Attack of the Clones was on the right track, but it still has a long way to go. At any rate, I will be looking forward to that series-tying arc May 2005. :)
B0002OERI0|5.0|I've been a lukewarm Green Day for several years because albums were mainly collections of hard-driving singles - fun, but the same level of noise never changed. <br /> <br />This weekend, I listened to nothing but American Idiot, straight through and over and over, during an 8-hour car trip; there are few albums that can withstand this kind of treatment from me.  I'm so impressed with the musical transitions inserted at just the right intervals and the diversity that keeps almost every minute absolutely fresh.  Lots of reminders of past revolutionaries, yes, but I love discovering that these guys were moved by bands like The Alarm possibly way back when I was.  Happily for me, this album is equally refreshing and exhausting.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I just finished watching Return of the Jedi from the boxed set.  All of the films are great!  I believe the changes George Lucas made to the films not only make them better, they help tie them into the first three visually and helps with continuity.  I was really worried as there was a different feel from the original films to the prequel films.  With the additions to episodes IV, V and VI, the transition will be much smoother.  The changes to the films were minimal and did nothing to change the ultimate story line.  The picture and sound quality are 100% better, especially in A New Hope. <br /> <br />For those of you that can't handle change, I suggest you select another genre.  SciFi is about change and progress.  These are George Lucas's films, he is an artist.  No artist creates to please others, they create to please themselves.  If others are pleased and enjoy it, so much the better.  It is not why you create.  He can do with these films as he sees fit.  The many problems he encountered in the making of the films did not limit his vision, just his ability to express his vision.  This was corrected in the DVD set.  I wouldn't be a bit surprised if he doesn't tweek them further after the release of Episode III. <br /> <br />So once again I say, Thank You George Lucas, you did a great job, and I really hope everyone with vision will buy this set of DVD's.  They are a BLAST!!!!!
B000002UJQ|5.0|Ok, seriously, this is one of THE most definitive albums of the 20th century.  Radiohead is perhaps the most brilliant and influential rock band making music today.  This album, released in 1997, is an absolute tour de force of musical talent; there are simply not enough superlatives to describe the genius Thom unleashes on OK Computer.  IF YOU DO NOT OWN THIS ALBUM YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND MODERN ROCK MUSIC!!!!  <br /> <br />The later stuff (Kid A and Amnesiac) is good as well, albeit a little more challenging, you really have to stick with it to get rewarded. The latest album (Hail to the Thief) is a little more restrained than the earlier stuff, although you can tell it comes from a fully matured artist. If you enjoy OK Computer go back to the bends and get a good feeling for their sound and then move on.  It actually might even be better to start with The Bends just to prep yourself for OK Computer.
B0001EKZOQ|5.0|Who would have ever thought that two such distinct disciplines could create such a sublime effect. I bought this album 2 months ago and have played it nearly 100 times! Not since I was a kid has a recording had such an effect on me. My wife loves it too. We saw Bebo and Diego live in Spain (twice) and it was an incredibly moving experience. If you can understand the words (in Spanish) so much the better, if not the music is still fantastic and the emotion that Diego conveys in his voice makes the hair stand up on your arms. Do yourself a favour and give it a try. I never liked jazz nor flamenco before this Cd - Now I am hooked.  <br />p.s  There is also a live DVD on sale from flamenco.com called Blanco Y Negro. This is excellent too! <br />
B00004Z459|3.0|Linkin Park used to be my favorite band until I started listening to SOAD more extensivley.  I never really noticed how plain and simple LP's lyrics are.  Basically:  \\"I'm paranoid!\\"  \\"No one listens to me!\\"  \\"I'm depressed!\\".  The lyrics are all about themselves.  It's a simple CD with some good tunes, but the lyrics are very plain.
B000002UQJ|5.0|The problem that Macca has which also plagues artists like Elton John is that they've been around so long, people just want to hear their favorites and usually aren't interested in anything new. Their catalogs are vast and with varying degrees of success, and let's face it, when you are one of these guys, when at their apex, were unparalleled, its hard to keep that standard going. They are competing with themselves, in essence. Macca's output has been sketchy over the years, he either hits a home run or puts out a so-so product. This album is a classic. \\"I Owe It All To You\\" is up there with some of his greatest songs. No small achievement. \\"Biker Like an Icon\\" is a 4 in the bar thumper that rocks. I saw someone criticize the song for its obscure lyrics, that's nothing new for Paul. Listen to \\"Junior's Farm\\" sometime and try to decipher that, and that song still kicks ass. The two aformentioned tracks from this album represent, ultimately, what the disc consists of: Solid rockers, and excellent ballads, and the musicianship and production is flawless throughout. Like anything new from an artist that you have heard for decades, it may take a little getting used to, but with quality like this, it doesn't take long. Highly recommended.
B000001FS3|5.0|This is the album that took my interest in U2 into darn near obsession. This album is absolutely flawless.  The music was at peak form here, Bono's voice was at peak form, and of course his lyrics will never be touched.  More than anything, Joshua Tree showed that there is no substitute for great songwriting.  \\"Streets\\" is the best song the band has ever produced, a song yearning for a better place to go to to escape the defiencies of this world, backed up by the classic fade-in and fade-out.  \\"Haven't Found\\" is perfectly representative of the theme of this album--trying to find yourself, but never quite there.  Great song.  \\"With or Without You,\\" is, of course, a masterpiece from start to finish.  You couldn't go wrong merely replaying those big 3 over and over again, but if you want to go past those, \\"Running to Stand Still\\"--about a woman fighting a drug addiction--and \\"One Tree Hill\\"--in honor of a band friend who died (the song was played at the funeral) are the other standouts. <br /> <br />U2 would never reach a higher plateau than this, although with All That You Can't Leave Behind, they came very close.  \\"All\\" proves that the band is not ready to quit making great music.
B0001DI0FI|1.0|What is it? <br />It's \\"Moby Dick\\" without the whale. And captain Ahab's drugged. <br />It's \\"Bounty\\" without the rebellion. <br />It's \\"Treasure Island\\" without Long John Silver. <br />It's horrible. There's this ship following another ship. In pauses between \\"turn that way, Mr...\\", there are feeble attempts of characterisation, unless they're busy painting the ship. Whatever worked in the three aforementioned movies, fails miserably. The worst thing is, it's obviously there. I can buy that a great white whale is a demon from Hell, but a demon taking a form of a technically more advanced French ship? Meh. <br />It's surgicaly devoid of charm, humour and anything resembling amusement. A few gross scenes that are potentially captvating, but by the time you get there, you don't care. A few scenes that should be moving fail 'cause you can't quite remember whi IS that guy who just died, really... <br />Actors? Horrible. Absolutely horrible. Then again they have nothing to do, they can't DO any better. If they cast Anthony Hopkins, Sean Connery, Brad Pitt and Alan Rickman, they'd look just as bad.  <br />Special effects and stuff? OK, that's well done. And the claustrophobics of the ship on the huge ocean is captured marvellously. Then again, after ages of chasing around, you expect at LEAST a spectacular finale. Unfortunatly, there IS none.  <br />It's a horrible movie. Don't buy it. Don't even rent it. Don't bother. If you MUST see a movie about the sea and the old ships and stuff, get the movies I mentioned above.
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|This is just awesome, BB and Ray recorded a song togheter back in the 80's, on one of rays albums. But BB only played guitar, he didnt sing. Here on Ray's final album, they join togheter on one of ray's old classics \\"Sinners Prayer\\". The voices has changed a bit over the years, but they play better than ever!Just listen to b's sweet sound on lucille. and ray on piano. mamma mia! it doesn't get any better than this, people! It was so great that they finaly did a real duet togheter. According to me, these are the greatest musicians ever, along with John Lee Hooker! So its so good that they did this before it got too late. sure, the other songs are good too. but when i put this album in my cd player, i just click repeat on \\"Sinners Prayer\\". Ray and BB. togheter. Wow. anyway, I miss Ray alote. Great last album.
B00005JGAF|5.0|Next to their debut album, this is my pick of The Ramones' best work ever. With the losses of Joey, Dee Dee, and Johnny, it's sad to think The Ramones are a band of the past, but when you listen to works like \\"Rocket To Russia,\\" you can say \\"they left an  enduring legacy\\" without sounding contrived and melodramatic. <br /> <br />I love the opening songs on Rocket to Russia because you hear such energetic merriment packed with lyrics of the celebrated misfists: the proud declaration that \\"cretins wanna hop,\\" followed by the seemingly innocent enthusiasm over hitching a ride to Rockaway Beach on a sunny day---without mentioning that Rockaway Beach is actually one of the grittiest, toughest, meanest beach towns in the country! <br /> <br />I love that we get a solid dose of unmistakable Ramones' lyrics in songs like \\"Sheena is a Punk Rocker\\" and \\"Teenage Lobotomy,\\" and then receive the greatest cover of \\"Do You Want To Dance\\" ever recorded. No revamped punk lyrics, just the most powerful homage to oldies rock & roll you will ever hear, done in that high-octane Ramones' spirit. This song is the prime example of punk rock & classic rock meeting, morphing, and totally emerging into one another. Sounds corny, hmm? True, though. <br /> <br />In my opinion, there are no bad Ramones albums out there, but this is one of their greatest works. If you have never listened to The Ramones before, this is a good place to start. If you are one of those folks who are just now discovering The Ramones, get happy, because you've got a lot of great music to listen to up the road. These cats were the greatest! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000067DNC|5.0|This show is one of the best SiFi series I have ever seen!  The actors are great!  The plot and story line are imaginative.  It is a great show! Oh, I said that already.
0800138015|5.0|Brilliant send-up of paranoid style in American politics. Cold War may have ended, but power-hungry residues endure, as evidenced in the Neo-con's Project for a New American Century with its fresh cast of Defense Department Strangeloves. Moreover, Peter Sellar's feckless Merkin Muffley remains a dead-on portrait of liberalism's incapacity to contain aggressive instincts of bomb-happy Pentagon planners. Small wonder Kubrick felt he had to leave the US to film this  iconoclastic take-down, his thanks being a spate of mixed mainstream reviews despite the movie's obvious brilliance. Over the years, I've puzzled about the sudden use of a cinema-verite style in the airbase combat scenes, which amounts to a dose of unexpected realism amidst the expressionistic style and gallows humor pervading the rest of the film. Perhaps Kubrick had too much respect for close-in killing (Paths of Glory) to play fast and loose with these otherwise atypical scenes. Anyway, they're about as stunningly realistic as any combat simulation from that era. All in all, the film anticipates rebellious spirit of approaching Vietnam era in richly sardonic fashion, and remains as relevant today as forty years ago as headline readers should recognize. Still and all, were the film remade today, war-profiteering corporations, such as Bechtel, Halliburton, and DynCorp would certainly merit front row seats before the Big Board, with a money-grubbing additional role for the great Peter Sellars that might make the demented Strangelove look positively sane.
0744583233|3.0|Very slow at times and not as action packed as the first four.
B0001FR3IQ|2.0|This is not THAT bad a movie.  Having seen the previews and having read the panning from critics I was expecting a movie so bad that it's laughable. <br /> <br />However this is not as bad as it has been painted. The idea and story is far fetched but it is a ghost story so why should there be rules? There are more holes in this film than on a golf course but the same can be said for many films of this genre. <br /> <br />Whilst there would never be any Academy Awards given out for this one the movie is at times very suspenseful and the cinematography is good.  <br /> <br />At times it feels a bit \\"Sixth Sense\\" ish - but of course it is in a completely different laegue. <br /> <br />Don't write this one off without giving it a go.
0345360338|4.0|There's an awful spoiler by one \\"seangator\\" that gives away the ending in these reviews, so be warned not to read them if you don't want the ending ruined.  I emailed Amazon that they should pull it.<br /><br />  Excellently realized history; my only problem is so many players, many with similar names.<br /><br />  The clash of wills between Henry III and Simon is interesting throughout.
B0000AUHPG|3.0|Enough people here had written that this was/is Leone's masterpiece so I had to see what I was missing. I've always considered the Good The Bad & The Ugly to be the best western I had ever seen and so there was good reason to check this out. Having read it is somewhat slow I wasn't expecting an action thriller but honestly the flick left me a bit (just a bit) disappointed. Maybe there's something more to this movie that's going over my head but to me the entire production seemed a little too grandiose to be offered to the public with so many big holes in it.     The soundtrack is what first comes to mind. Lots of people here have remarked about what an amazing work Ennio Morricone did with the score and I was really looking forward to it. Honestly it comes off as very uneven to me. I recall reading somewhere that Morricone had written the soundtrack before Leone had actually filmed the scenes and that might explain why it just doesn't fit very well. It seems to be disjointed and doesn't paint a background for the picture that helps to hold it all together. It's missing a genuine ambiance to it which is something you can get away with on an album or audio CD but a movie, especially one with the expectations this had, should have something subtly holding the whole thing together. That's not to say the music is bad but it is lacking. The harmonica bit played for the Bronson character is a good concept but it falls short of inspiring any particular message or feeling. The banjo plays far too much and is both out of place, lame and a little annoying.     The Frank character played by Henry Fonda isn't particularly believable. His voice conveys too much human emotion for someone who is supposedly truly evil. I think Eastwood's character being next to expressionless both visually and vocally would have been more in keeping with this plot. That is unless Leone intentionally wanted this character to show more emotion in order to portray him as a psychopath but if that's thecase Fonda was still badly cast. He just doesn't come across as being deep enough or twisted enough to really inspire that sort of terror.     Claudia Cardinale is a real piece of eye candy but I somehow doubt that a woman who looked like that would have survived thirty seconds in the old west. Bronson's character smiles too much and I just get the impression the entire production was intent on playing to American audiences. Too many big names that didn't particularly suit their part. I also got the impression that Leone didn't have total creative control over the production or it's subtleties. Something about the entire thing comes across as too many chefs in the kitchen. Too much compromising and the film suffers from lack of a unified/single vision.    The cinematography is fantastic but everything about the scenes seem sterile and phony. It's all too clean and everything (the saloons, the kitchens, train cars...) are almost sterile and missing the sort of filth that makes his previous westerns seem real and personal.     This isn't a bad movie but all things considered I think it could have been a lot better.
B0002OERI0|5.0|First of all, I've been listening to Green Day since the time before Dookie and didn't like the last couple of albums... <br /> <br />American Idiot is one of the worst songs on this album and it's a pretty good song.  If you're basing your decision on whether or not to buy this album based on that song, you're making a big mistake. <br /> <br />Jesus of Suburbia, Holiday, and Boulevard of Broken Dreams are all completely different songs and take a different approach from their previous albums.  Is this album less \\"punk\\" than their older stuff?  Yes, it is.  But, if you want to hear songs like Dookie, listen to Dookie.  Get upset with a band when they take a step backward, not when they take a huge step forward and put out an album like this. <br /> <br />Call it maturing, artistic growth, whatever else you want to call it.  This band has changed and it's a change for the better.  I was a little hesitant to buy it but it was on sale so I picked it up 6 days ago with some other albums.  I decided to listen to it first and I haven't listened to anything else since then.  I haven't even listened to the other stuff I bought last week.  This album is that good and everyone I know that has listened to it agrees with me.
B0002S94BG|5.0|This is a  fantastic album.  It is hard for me to explain what a great listen this is.  The added recordings are a bonus.  Like the Live at Sin-e leagacy edtion the material is great and being able  to hear some new material is good since we will not be getting any in the future.  I highly recommend grace as it is really a cd everyone should have in thier collection.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Ok some of you so called Green Day fans are saying that this album isnt a work of art, but you are very much mistaken. Sure, its not Dookie, but nothing will ever beat that. The first time I listened to the cd, I WAS dissapointed, but then as I listen to the cd again and read the lyrics I realized that this IS a materpiece, Blvd of Broken Dreams and Holiday have EXCELLENT lyrics are and excellent songs.  If you have listened to this CD just once listen to it again and give it another shot.
B000000HHE|5.0|Play this for your friends who think they don't like \\"rap\\". Infectious and original, these guys are having fun in the studio laying down killer beats, riffs and dubs. Enjoyed identifying the classic tracks they sampled, never heard a Hall & Oates tune sound so good! Great party CD, totally danceable, and you'll have 'em asking you for its name.
B00005JMX6|3.0|Mildly entertaining but entirely forgettable unless you are a teenage boy.
B00004TA41|5.0|\\"Interstellar Space\\" is one of John Coltrane's final masterworks recorded in February 1967, just five months before his untimely death. This was a time when Coltrane's music was at its most innovative, full of creative free-form intensity and experimental musical ideas. Depending on who you talk to, this final era of Coltrane's life could very well have been his best.<br /><br />With \\"Interstellar Space\\", we find John Coltrane accompanied only by drummer Rashied Ali in a series of six explosive sax/drum duets (two of which are bonus tracks not included on the original LP). Each of the six pieces are similar and feature some of Coltrane's best saxophone work - full of emotion and pure expression. His playing alternates between soaring melodicism and harsh atonality with neither style overshadowing the other. Rashied Ali's drumming is a perfect match for Coltrane's rapid fire performances. At times, his drumming is smooth and unintruding. Then, there are other moments when he attacks the drumkit like a meteor using rapid dynamics and complex time signatures. As mentioned before, Ali's drum style and Coltrane's sax compliment each other beautifully.<br /><br />The remastered CD includes all six tracks recorded during the February 1967 session and presents the album in superb sound quality revealing every nuance of the recordings. The CD booklet includes a detailed essay on the album and its creative process. As a special hidden bonus, the remastered CD also includes two minutes worth of false starts and studio chatter before track 1 begins. In order to hear these outtakes, hit your play button on your CD player and when track 1 begins, hit your rewind button. The disc should scan back into negative numbers revealing the hidden material.<br /><br />After 37 years, \\"Interstellar Space\\" is still one of John Coltrane's monumental works. The album shows off his sax playing in an unadorned style that remains unsurpassed. Because Coltrane passed away just months after its recording, the album sparks a question of \\"What might have been?\\" One can only wonder but without a doubt, he definitely stepped out of this world on top with this. \\"Interstellar Space\\", one of the final masterworks from an unprecidented master of timeless music.lbum sparks a question of \\"What might have been?\\" One can only wonder but without a doubt, he definitely stepped out of this world on top with this. \\"Interstellar Space\\", one of the final masterworks from an unprecidented master of timeless music.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This movie is bizarre. The question as to wether Donnie is insane runs through the whole piece. From his first encounter with the giant bunny rabbit Frank, we see the kind of almost random twists in this movie. Unlike most movies, the entire plot of the movie stays hidden until the very end. <br /> <br />I would recommend this movie to anyone who want something more than the usual crap coming out of Holywood.
B000003TAN|5.0|Sonic Youth was busy making their grandest masterpiece, Daydream Nation, while working with Mike Watt on the side project Ciccone Youth for The Whitey Album, and though the two couldn't be more different, the conceptual focus of Daydream clearly spilled over into Whitey.  It's moments range from complete jokes (Mike Watt's only-occasionally-emphatic vocals for Madonna's \\"Burnin Up\\"), to avant garde (\\"Me and Jill\\"), to both at once (Kim's brilliant karaoke take on \\"Addicted to Love\\"), resulting in an album of cathartic weirdness.  It's a relevant, fascinating throw-away ringing with as much artistic savvy as it does humor, all in an attempt to make something like a white hip hop record, and something like the deconstruction of a white hip hop record.
B0002ZMIU8|2.0|Ali G is, in my opinion, one of the best icons of British comedy to come out in the past 10 years. Taking the Mickey out of wannabe ghetto kids, white guys who pretend to be black and ignorant meatheaded idiots all at once whilst winding people up who think his politically incorrect and often stupid comments are serious, he has often reduced me to a fit of laughter on the living room floor. However, this full length film severely misses the mark.<br /><br />First off, the humour lacks any subtlty. We didn't need it spelt out that he wasn't really a gangster. We didn't need it spelt out that he wasn't well-endowed and that he didn't really get loads of girls. We didn't need to know that he lived with his mum. We knew he was stupid. Having it all spelt out ruins the image.<br /><br />Secondly, due to the lack of real life situations, there is no opportunity for Sacha Baron Cohen to utilise his quick wit and annoy people. Every joke is pre-planned for the film and rather than being an extension of the hilarious TV show, the film simply takes his character and puts it into a ridiculously unrealistic situation that, although may raise a smile, certainly won't make you laugh out loud.<br /><br />If this is all you've seen of Ali G then do yourself a favour and find some episodes of The 11 O'Clock Show or Da Ali G Show (the latter can be found on his Ali G Aiiiiii video). This film could be worth a watch if you like Ali G, but be warned: the quick wit and comedy genius is replaced with purile humour not much better than The Bloodhound Gang. And that's saying something.
B0002OERI0|4.0|Green Day is my favorite band, so pretty much anything they create is like gold for me, however I do realize that they are probably not capable of a 5 star album.  I think this is as good as they can do, and they have done it this good every other time as far as I'm concerned.  American Idiot is a great concept album that flows from beginning to end, the songs are as catchy as they are on any other album, and the lyrics fit well with with the (election)time.   <br />Buy it because it's Green Day, but this is not up there with The White Album(Beatles), Blood on the Tracks(Dylan), or Wish You Were Here(Floyd) so don't give it five stars please.
B00004Y6Q5|2.0|Well, I suppose this isn't the only film soundtrack to have disappointed me, but it is the only one to have disappointed me this much. Before I go any further - if you haven't seen the film (which I highly recommend you do) don't bother with this. Really, don't.<br /><br />Essentially, much of what you find here could have been really good, but rather than taking the time to make the music into some decent, epic lengthy songs or constructing the music in a way that is genuinely listenable, the music is simply put on the CD as it occured on the film. The result is a choppy album that rarely manages to maintain a dark or intense mood because of the constant changes. A cool upbeat riff for a minute, a quiet atmospheric track for a minute (literally). Only 9 of these 33 songs are above 2 minutes (and only one hits the 4 minute mark) while 11 are under a minute. Far too many of these tracks could have worked well as moody introductions to something longer, but are useless by themselves. Also, there are musical themes that repeat themselves during the film, and hence on here too, which in my mind makes an even stronger case for making separate tracks for separate themes (rather than simply running through the film), and all the more frustrating that they're not.<br /><br />To be fair, the longer tracks (which are still too short to get lost in) are decent and very listenable. Nonetheless though, its still frustrating to hear all this potentially wondorful music squandered by this lazy attempt at cashing in on the film when it could have been much more.
0141301155|5.0|It is so amazing reading the first chapters of this book. Knowing about the poor Charlie Bucket and his family. About Charlie who has to wait for a year to eat his most favorite food in the world, CHOCOLATE. The description about Chocolate in this book is so wonderful, making my feet walk to nearest store to buy five bars of chocolate as if I am a chocolate manic or something. The chocolate becomes more delicious, really. Then, I get know with this Mr. Wonka. The most unique imagination, crazy and hyperactive creature that I ever know, he's the maker of the Chocolate anyway. Reading the next chapters of this book is really making me out of mind, don't know why, maybe because I am just an adult who's too boring to understand the fantasy of this book. Especially during the trip along Mr. Wonka's factory, meeting the Oompa-Loompas, Augustus Gloop, the boy who only knows eating, who trapped in pipe of chocolate river. I just mention one incredible accident, for the rest you must read by your self. Still, I was forced to give five stars for this story, as a story that I'll never forget in my whole life and eager to tell it to my son and daughter, even maybe my grandson and my granddaughter, and see the expressions on their face. And maybe I have to buy them bars of chocolate after that. Welcome to Mr. Wonka's, enjoy the chococraziness.
B00007LTIC|5.0|Progressive Rock had been senescing exponentially since 1974/1975, so it is amazing that a full-blown progressive work like Going for the One (1977) ever saw the light of day. Going for the One is my favorite recording by Yes for any number of reasons: it is uplifting; it boasts tremendous musicianship; and finally, it is generally positive in outlook.  Although I can't effectively describe stuff like \\"uplifting\\" and \\"positive in outlook\\" I can certainly describe the music, which, as far as I see it, is possibly the best music Yes created following Close to the Edge.  On Going for the One there are two rocking pieces (Going for the One and Parallels), two quieter pieces (Turn of the Century and Wondrous Stories); and finally the 15+ minute epic Awaken, which is a very spacey piece of music and my favorite Yes composition. The playing on Awaken is beyond belief. Steve Howe plays lead parts on a 12-string with such incredible speed and precision that it does not seem humanly possible; Rick Wakeman returns to Yes on Going for the One with newly found energy and enthusiasm, which is mirrored in his sweeping and dramatic pipe organ parts and unchecked virtuosity. Chris Squire of course is the best bass player in rock, and Alan White holds it all together. Overall, there is a very dreamy and soft feel (or vibe) to the album. The cosmic lyrics contribute greatly to this vibe and the fact that Jon's vocals are awash on a vast ocean of echo certainly heighten the effect. Going for the One is great stuff, and is a recording I return to again and again. The Rhino remaster is extraordinary (in fact all of the Rhino Yes remasters are highly recommended) and the enhanced booklet features restored album art, copious liner notes, and photos of the band scattered throughout. Tracks that turn up on the Yesyears box set have been included on the expanded version of Going for the One (Montreux's theme, Vevey, and Amazing Grace) along with studio runs of all of the original tracks (including an early version of Awaken). Very highly recommended.uding an early version of Awaken). Very highly recommended.
B00005JN7O|4.0|Uhhh... Can you say Lois Lane meets Leni Riefenstahl in Laputa? Sky Captain is Joe Sullivan (Jude Law), who flies a vintage Annie Chenault Flying Tiger P-38 modified for aquabatics. His plane's number is h11-od, which makes more sense upside down, as does his girlfriend, Ace reporter Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow), and his other girlfriend with the eyepatch, British dreadnaught Frankie Cook (Angelina Jolie). He's also attracted to a mysterious female assassin (Ling Bai), the swine.  <br /> <br />Dr. Totenkopf, translateable equally well as either Dr. Skull or Dr. Deadhead (Larry Olivier), is the archvillain whose army of giant flying robots (slightly ahead of their time in 1939 New York) is out to \\"save\\" the world from itself, in his own (you guessed it!) dastardly and inimitably twisted way unless you've seen Moonraker.  <br /> <br />Maybe the only surprise in all this tongue in chic is the sheer mass of compacted cliches, but what makes it interesting to me, at least, is the undeniable fact that this movie is American anime, minus any and all actual animation except for what you see on the screen. The visuals could have been penned by Hayao Miyazaki, but the live action plot is some kind of metaphorically impure Marvel Comics bermensch fantasy. It's also the first movie I've seen since Der Blaue Engel in which German is spoken without a sneer.  <br /> <br />The gumsnapping sass is vintage Thirties Hollywood. There's also a Julie Garland walk-on in full Technicolor, as seen on a tiny square screen in one of those enormous Art Deco movie palaces from the period. The rest of this flick is sepia-toned.  <br /> <br />Four stars for fun, out of five. This is the best B movie since Milky Way went poppable, but you may need an elastic attention span. And grease your suspension of disbelief.
B00009NHC5|5.0|You can't miss with this movie!  I showed it my daughter's  Halloween party last year.  Seven 12-year olds were delighted with the suspense and terror!  No gore, no overly intense scenes, just enough creepiness and suspense to thrill the h--- out of them.  This is one of my all time favorite movies, and Audrey is excellent as the sweet, vulnerable blind woman.  I'm so excited that this is finally on DVD!
0062502182|5.0|I was told by someone very close to me (Lauren Mara Freiman) that this was one of her favorite books of all time.  I finally read it and completely understand why she was so captured by the book.  It's a book that belongs in every persons personal library.  It's meant to be read and re-read over various times in ones life.  It reminds one to stay the course and live life happily, going for what you really want out of life.  I really loved the way the author took a simple story into something that has truly been explained in so many complex ways.  My grandfather, Jose Antonio Armijo, was a sheepherder--and so, I took the story to heart.
B0000024K1|4.0|Anybody who would omit Public Enemy Or \\"Nation of Millions\\" from any serious discussion of the last quarter-century in American popular music - never mind rap - is an idiot.  The most important hip-hop album in history and the most radical political statement ever to go platinum, Public Enemy's sophomore effort set the stage for the two-pronged expansion of rap, which split into mutually antagonistic factions not long after the album's release, the most notable being the Afrocentric, bohemian Native Tongues posse (De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest, Queen Latifah, Jungle Brothers) and the hardcore Gangsta rap of the West Coast, spearheaded by Ice-T and NWA.  Both owe loads to P.E., who sparked a political consciousness in the music that has been all but marginalized by white bizzers convinced that bling, bitches and bubbly are the only thing mass audiences can understand.  Just as radical was P.E.'s sonic approach, an avant-garde, atonal barrage of sirens, squealing saxophones, hiccuping vocal samples and guitar feedback undercut by a rhythmic foundation copped from James Brown. <br />      That said, \\"Nation of Millions\\" is neither as focused nor as musically consistent as the two PE records that followed it.  With \\"Fear of a Black Planet\\" the group toughened up the beats and sharpened the lyrics, while the controversy over Professor Griff's remarks about Jews and the schism that it caused within the group lent the record a thematic unity and cohesion that \\"Nation\\" didn't have.  I know \\"Nation\\" is widely and rightfully perceived as a classic, but a few tracks, most notably the Flavor Flav and Terminator X showcases (check out \\"911 is a Joke\\" on \\"Planet\\" for Flav at his best) fall short of perfection, and some tracks sound rather thin and dated nearly two decades later, especially up against the heavier onslaught of \\"Planet\\" and \\"Apocalypse 91\\".  Highly recommended still - count my grade as 4.5 stars - and \\"Rebel Without A Pause\\" may be the best thing they ever recorded.  But PE got even better after this album, and if you want a comprehensive overview of hip-hop or of popular music in general, you're cheating yourself if you don't go out and purchase \\"Planet\\" and \\"Apocalypse 91\\" as well.
B0002OERI0|3.0|This album has really desappointed me.  I'm a real Green Day fan for over 10 years now, and as years go by, Green Day lose its intensity.  Dookie was a pure work of art in the punk rock style, but now with this album, it seems that they are really depressed about our whole society... and I am too... but I'm listening music to escape reality and I want something that really hits and has some punch.  If the whole album would sound like American Idiot, maybe it could be great, but most of the songs of this album are balads or really slow and sad songs... Green Day isn't that for me.  If you love Dookie, Kerplunk and Insomniac as I do, save your money and go buy a ticket for their show where they really return to Green Day's best time. (Montreal - nov.4 - I'll be there!! =)
B00000FC5H|5.0|Besides being an excellent-sounding compilation, this hit package will have you dancing from track one on through.  This band is one of the best ever at writing and performing songs that uplift as well as dazzle.  The horns are bright and the vocals are seamless all the way through.  If you are having a bad day this is the one to slap into the changer and groove your way out of the blues.  If only R&B was still this invigorating!
B0000VCZKM|5.0|You cannot beat the cast in this movie.  It has some of the greats, like Carol Burnett, Bernadette Peters and Tim Curry.  That is part of the reason why the Disney version could never compare to this one.  Also, Aileen Quinn makes such a great Annie.  She really looks spunky.  She can look really sweet, but also tomboyish.  She can look threatening, like all the times she raises her fists.  The girl in the Disney \\"Annie\\" looks too sweet.  She isn't as convincing when she tries to fight.  If you want to watch Annie, this is the version to get.
0671027387|5.0|My teeny weenie sore points on Deception Point (mind you, I loved this novel anyway) are the following...<br /><br />* Weak final twist in the plot. More intended for unexpected twist. But there is not much logical justification for the character to have the intentions he had or we are not shown much conclusive reason/justification/motive for the character to have acted the way he did.<br /><br />* We are informed that the faking of the meteorite requires use of state of the art expander cycle equipment which creates such a hot blast of heat which when subjected to a piece of terrestrial rock, will cause the rock to exhibit space burn characteristics to identify it with a falling meteorite. In the book, it is purported that NASA is an innocent bystander. Can this be considered plausible even in a fictional scenario that the use of such high profile state of the art equipment sitting in the NASA labs could have been used for this purpose without the explicit knowledge of at least a few NASA personnel. To not link any kind of NASA's involvement leading up to an all too neat political end, Dan has taken the easiest way out.<br /><br />* The very comic black and white character of Senator Sedwig Sexton. Everyday real life human beings even as power hungry and unscrupulous as the senator are not as totally evil as is portrayed in the book. It's like the author made the senator into the villain of the comic book. I would have preferred if the senator's character had been painted with a little more shade of gray. No one is an intrinsically evil person, it's just that every one has a reason, an experience and history to act the way they do. May be Dan could have brought a little more real world balance, maybe showing a glint of the good side of the senator. That would have felt more real.<br /><br />Everything else is superb. I don't know about the plausibility of the science, and whether the speculative science in the novel can stand up to hardcore scientific scrutiny. The amazing escape of the Rachael Sexton, Mike Tolland and Corky Marlinson throughout the book from certain death at the hands of the delta team is made pretty believable and is nicely action packed. After reading a few of Dan's books, you would be aware of the author's tendency  of revealing the villain as the most unexpected character for the killer-punch-climax factor. After having read Da-Vinci, Angels and Demons, guessing the evil master mind villain was easy as I had to just go for the guy who seemed to have the least possible motive (as per evidenece provided to us in form of narrative from the author in the pages leading up to the revelation) for being the villain. I think Mr. Dan needs to reverse this trend. His desire to provide the unexpected twist is getting all too predictable.<br /><br />That said everyone of Dan's Novel is made for the movies. The reason - they are fast paced, have a not too complicated plot structure, has a lot of intrigue and suspense, is totally action packed and has quite a bit of high-tech thrown in for good measure. I have already bought the copy of \\"Digital fortress\\" and I can't wait to read it. With Every novel I am impressed at the quality that he is able to sustain. Dan's approach is like Michael Crichton, but extends Michael Crichton. And just like Michael Crichton, he puts in a hell of a lot of research into the subject matter, which makes everything all too credible. He is versatile and very accomplished at every sub-style of writing. Once again, you'll learn quite a few facts which you will be surprised to hear. But all the same, the ride will be fun, entertaining, and illuminating. Also Dan has the ability to write these really neat pages where the characters will get a flashback and recall something in the past. The way these pages are written and also the way Dan provides passages where the characters exhibit introspection are a hallmark of a great writer. Dan Brown is able to successfully synthesize a thrilling cloak-and-dagger atmosphere, a credible plot idea involving genuine and very real institutions/cults, hardcore facts (borne out of hard research) intermeshed with good sound hi-tech backgrounds. In almost every one of his novels, you'll learn a thing or two about which you were never aware It's odd that we all learned of him through Da-Vinci, but as I pick up his earlier novels, he seems to get better and better. Dan exhibits versatility in terms of his areas of writing. He is as much at home with codes and ciphers as with religion and history as he with high-tech action packed stories with political overtones. Although all his books including this one are great, Dan should have reached bestseller status the day he completed Angels and Demons, but off course Da -Vince turned out to be the jackpot (Mind you I love DV too but A&D should have got to the bestseller's list first). Dan is here to stay and I am going to read every damn book he puts up through out his life. \\"Deception Point\\" is a more solid novel, it takes a bit of time to build, but once that's through you cannot put the book down. Pick up this book and enjoy the wild ride. You will not regret it.<br /><br />PS: look out for the great epic one-on-one high octane cat-and-mouse battle between Mike + Racheal VS The delta team. This scene conjures  up epic hollywood blockbuster movie images. You have a crashing helicopter, underwater volcanic whirlpool storms, blood thristy sharks, explosive heavy detonation missiles, a whole rig like ship going down, humans being chewed by sharks, etc. This accounts for the last 30 odd pages and is highly cinematic. This scene will be the energizing last 15 minutes of the movie version, if made.d-dagger atmosphere, a credible plot idea involving genuine and very real institutions/cults, hardcore facts (borne out of hard research) intermeshed with good sound hi-tech backgrounds.

B0002V7OI8|5.0|Although \\"Deep Impact\\" invariably gets compared to \\"Armageddon\\", I think it's more appropriate to compare it against all other disaster movies. Viewed in that light, it not only surpasses \\"Armageddon\\", but every other film in the genre. <br /> <br />Unlike most disaster epics, \\"Deep Impact\\" is character driven. I think this is a direct effect of its having been directed by a woman rather than a man. While the special effects are there and are impressive, what drives this film are the emotions of the excellent ensemble cast. All of them ring true, from the occasional duplicitousness of the government bureaucrats, to the real tear jerking moments of those facing tough life and death decisions, to the small intimate moments. It's powerful enough stuff that I have to believe that a lot of the negative reaction the film elicited vis-a-vis \\"Armageddon\\" came from guys who don't like their action movies to move them to the verge of tears in public. <br /> <br />All disaster films depend on a hook to set them up. In this respect, most fall far short of realism and believability. Of ones that come immediately to mind, only the cosmic collision movies and \\"The Towering Inferno\\" had realistic setups. <br /> <br />All disaster films depend on the heros to come up with some way to save the day. Of the ones with a believable setup, many still fall short of believable and/or technically accurate resolutions. This is where \\"Armageddon\\" failed miserably. Mimi Leder had expert advice from NASA and it shows. \\"Armageddon\\" has some impressive training facilities shots from NASA, but ignored the actual technology. Very early in \\"Armageddon\\", when I saw the two shuttles docking with the space station by coming in from opposite directions, performing clearly aerodynamic banking maneuvers, I was ready to start pelting the screen with rotten tomatoes! <br /> <br />Giving the devil his due, both films glossed over the full impact of operations in the microgravity environment of the comet's surface. <br /> <br />Still, it's the raw emotions that elevate \\"Deep Impact\\" above its genre, not just the technical stuff. It's actually best in its quiet moments. Among the ones that clearly stand out: <br /> <br />The president (Morgan Freeman) tries to continue to maintain an upbeat message as each plan successively fails. His press conferences and the dialog around them rings true. <br /> <br />The dialog between the reporter (the usually annoying Tea Leoni) and her mother (Vanessa Redgrave) also rings with truth. <br /> <br />The ultimate reconciliation between the reporter and her father (Maximilian Schell) just before the end reflects the bitterness of choices each has made in getting to that point. <br /> <br />The reunion of the kid who helped discover the comet (Elijah Wood) and his girlfriend (Leelee Sobieski), oblivious for the moment to what was going on around them - again, this simply rings true. <br /> <br />The astronaut observing wryly, \\"Well, the good news is that we'll all have high schools named after us.\\" No melodramatics, no macho heroism, just someone injecting a sense of humor into a shared fate she has accepted as necessary to save the people they love. My favorite line in the film. <br /> <br />From start to finish, this film is a class act. A realistic film that carries an emotional impact to be expected of its serious subject matter. Part of this impact is that you can't always guess in advance which characters will and will not survive. Of the ones who don't survive, not all face their fate gracefully, but all are believable. <br /> <br />This movie began my fandom of Mimi Leder, who I consider to be one of the best directors working today - not always commercial, but always excellent. This is on my short list of my top ten favorite movies of all time. Highly recommended!
B00003W8NM|5.0|This 2-disc set is what DVD is all about. Exceptional 2.40:1 picture quality, awesome Dolby Digital 5.1 sound, and a wealth of extra features to satisfy even the most demanding movie buff. <br /> <br />The stand out feature on this DVD is definitely the multiple audio commentary tracks. These tracks are highly entertaining and informative, especially the track from Edward Norton and Brad Pitt (listen for the classic 'streets will be safer' line from Norton). I just finished reading the 'Fight Club' novel by Chuck Palahniuk, and listened to the commentary track he does with screenwriter Jim Uhls, another winner. <br /> <br />The commentary tracks only scratch the surface of the extras here, but for me are the most worthwhile - meaning that if you can only get the single-disc edition, it's still good value. Still, I can't stress enough how excellent the 2-disc set is, the deluxe packaging is brilliant and the content exhaustive. Fans of 'Fight Club' will not regret this purchase.
1400032717|5.0|This is a wonderful book and one that can be read in a day or two.  It gives anyone who works in a school setting so much information about how an autistic child perceives the world around them.  So often we see students just like Christopher....students who when their schedule changes just a bit or when they are faced with too much stimuli just crawl under a chair or table or begin screaming.  This book is very captivating and touching as well.  As soon as I finished it, I passed it along to our Director of Special Services and she will be giving it to our Resource/SDC Teacher who will pass it along to the principal.  I don't think I will ever forget this book and it will always help me deal with people who are \\"different\\" and to appreciate their strengths which are many.
B0002DB52M|5.0|The 3-hours go by fast, the movie will make you feel sad, happy with joy (15 rings of the bell), ANGRY (rape), sad then Relief. The movie is not anti-American it could have been a story from Russia or Mexico, it just deals with man kind at it's best then show us it's worst, the story is told in a simple format, there is no blood or black bruises, the film lets the viewer's mind fill in the blanks of the scenes. I could go on, but if you would like more info, all you have to do is read a few of the other reviews, overall a very interesting film, it will keep you thinking long after the DVD has stopped.
078681859X|5.0|Well, I have to be honest but at first I think I picked it up numberous of times at the book store but was not sure I'd really like it.  I was not a person who read books with a first person's point of view but I gave in finally and bought it in paperback, only to find out that it was in a first person point of view and a third person's point of view.  I also got a kick out of the cliff notes.  I mean who uses cliff notes in books.  That was pretty cool.  Well, Once I got to Chapter 7, I was lost.  I could not put the book down.  It was very well written and boy do you end up liking the good characters (Though there really was no particular good person in it if you ask me.)  Everyone has their own personality but you grow to like them.  The Djinni is very cool.  I look forward to reading book two and hope it is just as good.   <br />I am a 37 year old mother so don't think this book is just for children.  I have been reading a lot of young adults fiction and fantasy books lately. They are just fun to read and fresh.  I get so tired of the adult novels with so much crime etc. or so much romance.  These books are very fresh and imaginative.  I may keep up with this for a long time, as long as there are authors out there like Stroud, Rowling, you name it.
B00003CXCT|5.0|lol seriously you guys seem to have some underground conspiracy or something that when George Lucas makes one minor alteration you claim that the world is ending and litteraly crap yourselves. If you really care so much about the originals than \\"use the force\\" to transport yourselves back to the 70's before you became obsessed with the movie and ruined any hopes of having a life in the future. For regular movie buffs like me, however, this is a great addition, besides what the 40 year olds living in their mom's basements and teaching Special Ed Kindergarten classes say. Peace.
B0001XAPX8|4.0|I came away with mixed feelings about the film on multiple levels, which speaks to its complexity. Previous reviewers have articulated many of the same thoughts as mine. Ed Harris was flawless playing an angry ex-Vietnam vet, one of his finest performances.  Nicole Kidman's acting was excellent, but her efforts to sound American also made her sound stilted and every word took twice as long to be articulated.  Mr. Miller who plays the young Silk and Ms. Smith who plays his mother were so compelling together, they stole the show.  The talented performances by a fine cast, strangely did not work well as an ensemble.  <br /> <br />The political correctness theme superimposed on the Clinton/Monica Lewinsky scandal was an annoying distraction.  Yes, political correctness has been used and turned around such that its good intentions became its own destruction.  Here, the word \\"spook\\" is used to illustrate how it can be manipulated to make its usage seem ill-intentioned.  That is the argument against political correctness, that we attach moral connotations to words and judge people not by their actions or intentions, but their verbal diarrhea.  But, the deeper issue is the way society creates these moral dilemmas in the first place, which challenges detractors of political correctness.  What ultimately bothered me about this film was the over-moralization of young Silk's choice, which undermined society's role in his choice.  The young Silk was not a sympathetic character, which is reflected in the undercurrent of accusation that all his losses stemmed from his dishonesty.  The irony is that racial prejudice created this conflict for him, and in this instance society bears the bulk of the responsibility.   <br /> <br />The interactions of young Silk and his family were so moving, it is a shame that they were given homage only in flashbacks.  The poignant dialogue will be remembered for a long time.  It could have been a great film, but too much time devoted to the older Silk brought it down a notch. The older Silk's relationship with Nicole Kidman's character was overplayed, where it should have just been an interesting sidebar.  The strength of the movie relies on the past so much, it should have stayed there.  But, well worth seeing and an excellent movie overall. <br />
B00005JKJA|5.0|Mulholland Drive is undoubtedly the best David Lynch film to come out since Blue Velvet and one of the best films ever to come out of independent cinema. I ended up watching this film five times in the theater because it was that addicting. The story was so intriguing and the casting was just perfect. I'm amazed at how well the two unknown actresses had acted in this. They gave amazing oscar-like performances, very much like the acting seen in hollywood films during their heyday. You can find everything in this film including suspense, horror, mystery, drama, comedy, art and erotica.     The whole 1950's vibe in this film really brought back a sense of nostalgia back into Hollywood cinema. It makes movies feel alive again. The setting makes you feel like the movie takes place during the 50's when it actually takes place during the present day. We actually don't know that for sure, Lynch doesn't tell us, it could have taken place during the 50's, who knows? The entire film is actually this freakin twisted. Anyways, the film in itself is great. The film is beautifully shot and the cinematography, especially the lighting and color, is extraordinary. David Lynch's unconventional way of shooting things and telling stories is very much like that of Orsen Welles and Alfred Hitchcock. Like their films, Mulholland Drive is a very visual film with a lot of vivid imagery. This is best displayed during the climactic scene of the story when the whole story changes after a mysterious blue box is unlocked. We find that the main character, Betty, has disappeared and her friend Rita has become unconscious. After the pandoras box is opened, we are brought back to reality and we are introduced to two new characters, Diane and Camilla. The whole dream sequence ends when Diane is awaken by a mysterious cowboy and starts rolling out of bed. We come to realize that Betty/Diane's reality is not as happy as we depicted it to be. We learn that Diane is an actress who exploits Camilla by using Camilla's fame and fortune for her own purposes of breaking into hollywood, but instead she only finds herself falling in love with Camilla along the way. During their affair, Camilla unexpectedly dumps Diane for the director, Adam Kesher, and takes the role that's supposed to be Diane's big break. This leads to Diane's jealousy and frustration in a gut-wrenching masturbating scene. Feeling that she lost everything, she seeks revenge and hires a hitman to kill Camilla. When she finds out that the hit has been made with the presence of a blue key, she kills herself.     The acting in this film is superb especially by Naomi Watts. Naomi Watts' true life story of struggling to get roles and finding her big break in films helped her a lot in portraying this character. This ended up being her big break and she has thrived ever since with 'The Ring,' '21 Grams' and other upcoming films. She shines onscreen especially during a lesbian love scene with actress Laura Harring. It's one of the most erotic love scenes I have ever seen captured on film. Laura Harring and Naomi Watts are stunningly beautiful and the reason alone to watch this. Surprisingly, Lynch's music composer Angelo Badalementi, even makes a rare cameo appearance in this. He is the man who drinks the coffee and spits it out in the scene where Adam Kesher and the casting agents argue about which girl to cast in their film. Other cameo appearances include the great Ann Miller, Robert Forster, Dan Hedaya and Billy Ray Cyrus.     The only flaws I can possibly think of this film having is in the DVD itself. There is no chapter search and no special features other than the theatrical trailer and the cast bio's. David Lynch intended it to be only one long chapter which was a mistake on his part. Another flaw I noticed was an edit in a nude scene. It's the scene where Rita takes off her robe. A part of her body is blurred for about a second. A terrible decision to make since it was unedited on the big screen. DavidLynch fans will be disappointed about all this. Hopefully, a new special edition DVD will come out to replace this one with deleted scenes, commentary, interviews and most importantly a chapter search. It's unfair that about ten other countries have already released this as a special edition and the U.S. and Canada has not. Two foreign editions even have double discs full of special features. Why is this? Where is our special edition? Well, someday it will be released. If you want more info go to davidlynch.de, you could probably be lucky and find it on import.
B0002OERI0|4.0|I would love to give this 4 1/2 stars, but alas they do not allow that. This album is amazing. It is right up there with Dookie and the rest of the early albums(Slappy Hours, and Ker Plunk!), and is just simply amazing. From the great single/title/opening track it just keeps rolling onward. There is no song that is bad, some are definately better than others(which every album is that way, including greatest hits albums), but they are all great tracks. this shows a more grown up band, but still angry enough and this will sell great. If you have ever liked Green Day before, this is a no-brainer to pick up and enjoy, and if you are new, go ahead pick it up, then pick up Dookie, and the rest. All are good in there own respective ways.
B00003CXCT|3.0|Why?  These movies are just movies, but then again they're not.  You've got all these Matrix-generation goofnuts saying that it doesn't matter if changes are made.  But they don't get it.  It's like having part of your childhood re-written.  If your dad didn't take you to see these, or you were a baby or unborn at the time, then of course it doesn't matter.  But for those of us 32 and older, these movies are a moment in time.  Changing them does matter.  Some changes are good, like cleaning up the picture quality, fooling with backgrounds and things of that nature.  The new wampa scene is lame, and it throws off the timing of the sound when the lightsaber cuts through the ice.  And that's another thing.  What did they do to the sound on these dvds?  The snowstorm on Hoth sounds metallic like it was recorded in a trash can, Boba Fett's voice is changed, and all the sound throughout every film is different.  Just feels weird.  The cleaned up rancor scene is good, but all CGI creatures added to these films only serve to goof them up.  I can even live with Greedo shoots first (though it doesn't make sense), and a few other scenes that were added or altered.  But the ultimate slap in the face was putting Darth Vader as a kid at the end.  He looks younger than Luke, and that's supposed to be his father, and that's not the age at which he died.  Why isn't Obi-Wan 15 years old too?  It's dumb, and it absolutely ruins the whole trilogy.  His father should have remained the same as before.  That scene used to send chills up my spine every time.  Now it makes me want to puke.  Sad.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|You don't have to be a Buffy or Angel fan to love this.  I truly thought that this was THE ABSOLUT BEST TV I have ever seen!!!<br /><br />I could write a book about how good it is and why...but just trust me - The Best TV even filmed and here it is for you to buy, for just a few dollars, so do just do it and enjoy.<br /><br />I'm on my 4th watching of the series and I usually never watch stuff more then once or twice.<br /><br />Again - THE ABSOLUT BEST TV EVER FILMED.
B00003CXCT|5.0|First things first, I am not I repeat NOT!! One of those incredibly nerdy star wars obsessed virgins.  I'm a fan of these epic movies and I always have been.  I am not a scrutinizer of details like whether this laser gun was issued to this galaxy or if it was supposed to look this or like that.  The movies have always been legendary and the few additions to these three, have only made the movies more memorable for our high tech generation.  If these parts weren't encorporated into the DVDs the movies would be less realistic to the CGI buffs that are the new generation.  People can complain all they want about making the movies more beautiful, and enjoyable but I'm in love with this set, and I think anyone that loves the originals, but isn't totally obsessed with it, would love this set.
B00004W4UB|5.0|I absolutely loooove this movie!  Julia Roberts' BEST performance is right here folks!  And John Malkovich just makes it so insanely amazing!  Trust me when I say that if you liked From Hell or Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, you will LOVE this movie!
0783225792|5.0|Scorsece made 3 masterpieces in his career so far, Gangs of New York (his best), Goodfellas (second best), and this (his third).  GONY and this share the same flaw, too much smut, but GONY is overall a better film.  Goodfellas as no smut, but still i like GONY better.  They are all great films, very close, each one is a true masterpiece.  They are all very entertaining crime dramas, and all are shocking, dramatic, well performned, very well crafted, very great films.  All his other movies, well, are just bad, what the hell was Mean Streets, TERRIBLE, thats what, and taxi driver is just weird.  But the GONY, Goodfellas, and this are great, of course Godfather is still the best in this genre, but those three are very close.  I give each one a 9 out of a 10, its hard to say which is the best, but if you asked my previous order is what i would tell you.
B0002OERI0|5.0|this election year.  This album is exactly what the country needs during these trying times.  It stirs my blood to read some of these reviews that accuse the members of Green Day of being unpatriotic.  Of course, they support the troops, there are very few people in this country who are anti-military.  I applaud them for releasing an album that is so blatantly against the president during an election year.   <br /> <br />I was a fair weather fan of Green Day ( I loved \\"Good Riddance\\" and \\"Nice Guys Finish Last\\", but I never considered myself a true blue fan) until I heard \\"American Idiot\\".  I listened to it about three times through this weekend and I found it to be a really wonderful example of what an independent thinking musician can accomplish when he has the guts to speak his mind.  The album paints a rather dismaying portrait of suburban life in America.  It doesn't blame the president for these conditions, but it doesn't condone him either, at times it's pretty harsh.  If you're a fan of our president or the republican party, you might choose to ignore or you might miss entirely GD's subtle attacks and jabs.  In this case, not so subtle attacks at the media and the administration: \\"can you hear the sound of hysteria?  The subliminal mind-f*@# America.\\"  <br /> <br />In my humble opinion, there is no choice in this election.  This isn't a vote for who you'd rather drink beer with at the local pub, it's about who you want to get us out of this quagmire that we've made for ourselves.  Four more years of ineffective, improvident, and poorly planned foreign policies or a new start.  The choice is yours to make.   <br /> <br />Buy this album and then take a moment to ask yourself are you better off now then you were four years ago?  I don't mean to turn this into a political speech, but try to remember a time when fear didn't govern your life.  When WMD's were only talked about at presidential debates, when Iraq was an \\"ally\\", then try to imagine a future where we're not sitting around waiting for the sky to fall.  America's best years are ahead, vote Kerry-Edwards in 2004!
0385508417|1.0|Either Grisham's satire, parody and ironic wit went over my head...or this book was as insipid and screamingly obvious as it appeared.  Duh!  Stick to thrillers, John.  This would have been more appropriate for the yearly Christmas letter sent to your family and friends.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I read a lot of these reviews out here prior to purchasing my Widescreen DVD's.  I was a little worried about what I was going to get as far as the quality goes. There was so much talk about bad picture quality,  bad sound quality. <br /> <br />After getting my DVD's,  slapping them into my progressive scan DVD player, playing through my HDTV hooked up to a 5.1 surround system..  I can tell everyone out there that everything WAS PERFECT!!!  The people writing these reviews stating that the video and audio translations to DVD are poor,  are flat out lying or have system problems.  These movies look and sound like they were made yesterday,  absolutely fantastic!! <br /> <br />I'm not going to get into the debate about old or new versions..  it doesn't matter to me.  I just wanted to tell everyone how visually stunning they are on DVD,  and how great the sound was.
B00005JNEI|1.0|Issues that are true, but presented out of context no longer can be considered true.  To see this movie from an unbiased perspective you must research the facts.  Too many people just accept it as the gospel according to Moore.  There is a rebuttal film to this, which chronicles the facts called Fahrenhype 9/11.  If you are really interested in knowing the facts, you must see both and then use your brain to think critically.  Don't just take one man's view (politics has never been know for honesty)
B0002YCVXI|5.0|Cello sound reminds me a human voice. When I hear a cello, I feel something inside my chest. I cannot explain this, but I feel very deeply the cello voice. It's a very emotional experience for me. That's why I love it very much!<br /><br />Recently, I discovered, that Yo-Yo Ma plays Morricone. I am sure you know the music of the famous Italian composer Ennio Morricone. Now, imagine all his famous titles are re-arranged for cello and orchestra. CD includes the most relaxing themes from such movies as The Mission, Cinema Paradiso, Once Upon a Time in America, The Untouchables and many others.<br /><br />I recommend this CD to fans of classical crossover, soundtrack lovers and those who just need to relax with an excellent music.
1591840562|5.0|The Art of the Start is the best book that I have ever read about business - and I have read most of them.  I used to think it was How to Drive Your Competition Crazy (also Guy Kawasaki) but I have changed my mind.  Not to take anything away from Jim Collins' (Good to Great) or Tom Peters' (all of them) books but the Art of the Start is great for several reasons:  It is an entertaining read; It is simple; It is real world; It is applicable; and there isn't a business on the planet that won't find some of this book appropriate for where they are today.  I don't recommend it - it is a MUST READ.
0553565915|4.0|I consider myself an ordinary, logical and self-confident individual at my forty. I live in the US, but I was born and raised in far East. I do not belong to any churches nor religious groups, but I do believe in God (or higher supeior power). I picked this book up to kill my time when I was visiting my in-laws on our vacation. I always had a question about life after death, so I have been reading books, articles or anything that touches the topic here in America and back in Japan. My conclusion and answer to my question is that there is another life after death without our bodies, and that death is nothing to fear. No matter how alone we must feel in this life, our souls are closer to our friends and family in the way we don't even realize. I cannot explain or have no ability to prove my answer. Spirit world does exist according to all those people who experienced near death or came back from their deaths. What I most got out of this book was for us to really live everyday life with appreciations for things we have--both tangible and intangible, love one another, help ones who's in need, and learn and grow together while we are here. That is the message I received from her book as well as all other readings I've done. I feel that this kind of book is not there to be reviewed or analyzed the intentions of being published, but there to be available for those who are seeking an answer to thier questions about lives at thier own level. Easy to read book.

B00005N7Z1|5.0|In 1987 ROBOCOP was something of a problematic film. The studio had commissioned the European art house director, Paul Verhoeven, to direct an action-packed sci-fi in B-Movie tradition only he ended up giving them something that was more than a few years ahead of its time and something which the film censors would certainly take apart piece by piece. Knowing that they had a great unplayable film the studio was left with a decision - how much they should cut and what they should cut in order to get it a rating. Thus a number of versions of the film were cut - The Original Director's Cut, a cut R-rated version for the US, another less violent R-rated cut version for abroad and a special cut without any violence and bad language for afternoon kid's viewing.<br /><br />In the cinemas we watched the cut R-rated version. So we have never really seen the FULL unedited version of Robocop... until now. When a film censor cuts a film, they can actually imply certain things, instead of showing them, which can change the tone of a scene considerably. For some reason the uncut version is a lot funnier than the cut version. This is because the uncut version usually has some extended violent scenes that almost look comical. When reduced, they look at bit harder. For this reason the more sinister version of Robocop seems to be the cut version and the bloodier more violent uncut version a little lighter but certainly bloodier.... got that?<br /><br />The two versions on this disc are the (1) The uncut, originally unrated, now the new R-rated version of the Director's Cut and (2) The original cut R-rated version. Let's talk about the cuts.<br /><br />When ED-209 goes on the rampage, killing a businessman during a meeting, the scene is extended to show the young exec being hit several more times while lying on top of the Delta City model. Although this scene is certainly a lot bloodier, with body parts flying everywhere and visible holes appearing in the body, it is more funny than shocking.<br /><br />When Murphy and Lewis are chasing the gang in the van there is an extended scene of the shootout involving a villain's leg being shot to pieces in close-up.<br /><br />However the real cream of the crop is getting to see Rob Bottin's (special effects guru on The Thing) uncut version of Murphy's murder. The hand blasting scene is extended to show Murphy holding his stump out for longer with more blood squirting out. There is a scene then of the remainder of his arm being shot off. These extended sequences are quite violent. However the piece we all want to see is the infamous realistic head shot that Bottin masterfully created, but was cut from all the released editions of the film. Bottin built a full version of Murphy from the waste up for this scene. You can see Murphy's face contorted, screaming and the camera pans and you see a hole being blown in the back of his head.... all in one take. This was 1987 remember folks and that effect is as good as anything you will see today! Claps all round to Bottin ... nearly 15 years too late.<br /><br />The final scene is extended to give the bad guy a more violent death as he staggers around the place with two meter arterial spray for a few seconds more.<br /><br />Anyway the bottom line is to get this version to see Bottin's effects in all their glory without being cut. It is all A++ SFX work.is more funny than shocking. <br /> <br />When Murphy and Lewis are chasing the gang in the van there is an extended scene of the shootout involving a villain's leg being shot to pieces in close-up.  <br /> <br />However the real cream of the crop is getting to see Rob Bottin's (special effects guru on The Thing) uncut version of Murphy's murder.

B0002J4X1Q|5.0|I must say that the Resident Evil movie is one of my personal favourites. Not only for the fact that it is spawned from such a great game series, but also for the acting and the realism it contains. Not many people would agree with me when I say this is a good movie, but different people have different tastes, I guess. <br /> <br />Resident Evil takes place before the events of Resident Evil the game, and explains why the game's mansion is infested with zombies. The story follows Alice (Milla Jovovich), who is a woman that has forgotten her past and must travel with an Umbrella S.W.A.T team to discover who she is. Her path crosses with Matt (Eric Mabius) who is a delegate for a faction that opposes Umbrella, going under cover to discover what is really going on in The Hive. The tale unravels as they move deeper into the complex, and are picked off, one by one, by the ravenous zombies. <br /> <br />A must get for those who love the games! Buy it, or die!
B0002OERI0|5.0|I'll admit that I was afraid to get this album after I heard the first single, American Idiot, on the radio.  I mean, it's an ok song, not bad, but certainly not great.  I was afraid the whole album would sound the same way.  Thank goodness I was wrong.  The album is beautiful, a little sappy and melodramatic at times, yes, but still, very artistic.  I love how the entire album flows together and develops a theme.  I love Pink Floyd and this album reminds me a lot of their albums, particularly Dark Side of the Moon, because of the way it moves and grows.   <br /> <br />I've read most of the reviews on Amazon, and for the most part, the reviewers are spot on.  It seems like a lot of people on here like the song Wake Me Up When September Ends.  Hmmmm....I consider it to be the low point of the album.  Did you people listen to it?  It has no energy, and the guitar riff, if you can call it that, is simplistic and stupid, like something a beginning guitarist would write.  Anyway, besides that, the album is great.  <br /> <br />The standout tracks are Holiday (easily the best song on the CD, did you listen to the chorus, wow! great harmony), St. Jimmy (which is classic, frenzied Green Day) and Jesus of Suburbia (great blend, a bit of everything).  The album as a whole has a long listening life. It doesn't ever seem to get old, because it covers a refreshing breadth of styles/genres.  This album is different from older Green Day stuff.  If you're stuck in 1993, then don't buy it.  If you want something new, slightly sophisticated, and enjoyable, pick it up.  I heard that during their next tour, Green Day will only be playing this album, straight through.  Hmmmm...not a bad idea on paper, but it will be hard to fork over good money to see them knowing they won't be playing old stuff.  I guess no one's perfect.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Wow...I am utterly and completely blown away by the Firefly series! It is one of the greatest TV productions ever made, and my level of respect for Joss Whedon has risen to astronomic proportions. Having never seen any episodes from \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" or the \\"Angel\\" series (also written by Joss), I was initially extremely skeptical, especially after hearing about the science-fiction Western theme. Like many others, I totally missed it on TV in 2002 (it aired on Fox from September 02 to December 02, when it got canceled), and the first time I had even heard of the series was when I was surfing Amazon reading reviews for new movies. The DVD box set, launched in December 03, looked interesting enough and was priced inexpensively, and with several hundred positive reviews, I figured there was no harm giving it a go. Little did I expect that I would get such immense enjoyment from a brilliantly crafted story filled with rich character development... <br /> <br />I was under whelmed with the first 15 minutes of the 2-hour pilot episode, \\"Serenity\\". I was still skeptical and thinking to myself, \\"What's the big deal?\\" Then, as each minute passed, I was gradually hooked in and by the end of the episode, the only thing I could think about was playing the next episode! \\"Serenity\\" provides a great introduction into a world that resides in Whedon's wonderful imagination, and the characters are all intriguing and three-dimensional. Rather than describe the story, which you can find out for yourself by watching the DVD and reading other reviews, I will instead detail my own personal experiences with the series and some of the circumstances surrounding its production. <br /> <br />Once you get to the end of the fourteen episodes, which still represents an incomplete first season, you are literally begging for more. Your heart is filled with sorrow as you realize that there is no more to come. Although modern day DVD's are usually packed with special features, I am typicallynot a person who utilizes these features. But not in this case - I proceeded to watch all the extras on the DVD. In the interview with Joss on the making of the movie, it was painful to see how he talks about his passion and inspiration behind Firefly, only to have it canceled prematurely by impatient Fox executives. Every TV series needs a grace period to ramp up and attract viewers, and it is a tragedy that Firefly was never allowed a chance to do so. Otherwise, it would have surely been one of TV's greatest series, and would probably be up to Season 4 or 5 by now!!! <br /> <br />During the interview with Joss, it is evident he frequently struggled with the self-absorbed Fox executives. In their bid for high ratings and their self-assured knowledge that action sells, they even forced Joss to air the episodes out of order, showing ones that had more action first, and not allowing the proper introduction that the first episode \\"Serenity\\" would have provided. When will they learn? Those executives should stop tinkering with a brilliant man such as Joss' vision and imagination, and simply let him get on with what he does best. <br /> <br />Another thing that emerges from the interviews is how tightly-knitted the whole cast were. The casting was done extraordinarily well, and you can really see the individuals displaying a huge amount of camaraderie, caring for one another immensely, both on-screen as well as off-screen. The chemistry between all the various characters is subtle yet noticeable, and that is pure brilliance at work. In the interview, Ron Glass (Shepherd Book) talks about how everyone bursted into tears at the end of the final episode they filmed, and your heart totally goes out to them. <br /> <br />After watching all 14 episodes (three of which were never aired on TV) and all the extras on the DVD (including an Easter egg of Jayne singing!), I was relentless in my quest to resurrect this series. Upon surfing the web, I realized I wasn't alone - there were legions of fans out there, all wanting to keep the magic alive. In fact, it was so touching to witness their dedication - after the show was canceled, they even took out a full page ad in Daily Variety, proclaiming, \\"You keep flying. We'll keep watching.\\" Truly inspiring, and obvious proof that if this series was anything less than extraordinary, you wouldn't get this sort of outstanding reaction. <br /> <br />Well, the good news is that after the DVD was released last December, sales rocketed through the roof and Universal sat up and took notice. They have since bought the rights and Joss has just finished filming a movie titled \\"Serenity\\" (incidentally, this is the name of the ship, also known as the tenth character), scheduled to hit theatres on April 22, 2005. While the movie won't make up for the continuity of the series, it is great to see a positive step in the right direction and I will keep supporting this series in hopes of a revival on TV. I have already gone round spreading the word, and to date, I have bought over 10 copies of the DVD from Amazon just to give away to friends and family. It is amazing how under-publicized the series was - none of my friends have even heard of it. The challenge to broaden awareness is steep, but I won't rest till the word is out - that Joss has truly created something special, a series worthy of residing in the halls of TV legacy. Now, go purchase a copy and spread the word too...! <br />
B0002OERI0|5.0|I'm not going to pretend to be a big Green Day fan.  I haven't really been too impressed with anything since Insomniac.  This cd blew me away.  Lyrically alone, it's one of the most powerful rock cds that I have heard in years.  I had given up on rock music, with only hearing 2 really good rock cds in the last year or so (that being The Trews and Franz Ferdinand).  I moved on to rap (a genre that is actually progressing).  This Green Day cd is the best rock album that I have heard since Coldplay's 'A Rush of Blood to the Head'.  I'm sure many people disagree with me that the rock scene was in trouble.  That's fine.  But for me, this cd means a lot to me.  1. It made me re-fall in love with a band that I loved 10 years ago, and 2. gave me a reason to buy a rock album.<BR>As I stated earlier, I can't say enough about the lyrics (10/10)<BR>Cd flow is great - I'm sure that was the point of this 'Rock Opera'<BR>For me, this cd doesn't get any better than - Jesus of Suburbia, Holiday, Give Me Novacaine, Wake Me Up When September Ends, and best of all Boulevard of Broken Dreams.  This last song is gonna do big things.<BR>So buy the cd.  Thanks<BR>Mark
B0002OERI0|4.0|It's been 4 years since Green Day released the (for me) disappointing \\"Warning\\", and since then a LOT has happened in the world, 9/11 foremost, which appears to have been a source of inspiration for Green Day, as the band comes back with a vengance, and with a rock opera no less! Ahhh, the forgotten art of the rock opera!<br /><br />\\"American Idiot\\" (13 tracks but really 22 songs; 57 min.) is Green Day's version of The Who's Tommy or Genesis' The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway. I'm not entirely sure what the story line exactly is, but there is plenty of anger, frustration, lost loves, confusion, and redemption (which of course are themes expored in every Green Day album). But musically Green Day hasn't sound this good in YEARS. The title track is Green Day at its best. There's much to do about the two 9+ min. tracks, but in reality both of them are simply 5 songs cramped together without the 1 or 2 seconds of silence between regular tracks. Other standout tracks include \\"Are We the Waiting\\", \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\", \\"She's a Rebel\\" and \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\".<br /><br />If there is one setback to the album, it's that it simply runs too long (almost twice as long as other non-compilation Green Day albums). After about 40-45 min., it feels like you keep hearing the same thing again, which is unfortunate as there is a lot of great music on \\"American Idiot\\". But for this, I probably would've rated this higher than 4 stars. Nevertheless, this album is highly recommended!
B00005JMEW|4.0|I've never been a big Tarantino fan (nor an Uma Thurmon fan), and I waited for this movie to come out on video before watching it.  I had low expectations.  Man! this movie blew me away!!!  I would have given it 5 stars if it weren't for the filthy language (that's a hurdle that's hard for me to get over).  But, aside from that, it was a great action-packed movie with excellent music and great acting.  Uma will never do better than she did in this movie.   <br /> <br />One may be tempted to think this movie a little cheesy, but that's if one tries too hard to fit this movie into the scope of reality.  It's not supposed to be realistic, it's supposed to be entertaining and humorous.  When the guy gets his head chopped off, don't analyze the way the blood squirts out and think it's unrealistic, just laugh at it!  You've got to have a good sense of humor while viewing this.  If you don't mind blood and violence, and enjoy seeing a good revenge movie, this is the movie for you.
B000002LPD|3.0|This is the only post David Lee Roth album by VH that I can listen to without cringing.The music is again rockin' & at times jazzy instead of sounding like 80's bubblegum.Hagar's voice is more powerful and has more feeling on this one than the previous two van hagar releases.Don't bother with any other V H albums released after 1984.
B000000OSE|3.0|This is not that great of an album, especially if you compare it to the greatest eighties album 'Appetite for Destruction'...but then again the eighties werent great at all. This is a good album, just nothing special. The only true masterpiece is the power ballad 'Live and Let Die' which is among my top five favorite ballads of all time. 'Coma' is also a great song and deserves to be recognized as well, its a very underrated song and always overlooked. The rest of the songs are okay, but I think that 'Use Your Illusion II' is better (Why couldn't Amazon provide a double album?). Slash still deserves a throne on legendary lead guitarists while Gilby Clarke, the Izzy replacement shows that he is more talented than Izzy (I never liked that b@$t@rd) and that he was a good choice to take over. Duffman, I mean Duff McKagen still manages to hold the bands rhythem together to provide a great foundation. Matt Sorum is okay, I wish they still had Steve Adler but I guess he's the next best thing. Axl Rose is what brought the rating down though. The only time his voice is good is on the songs mentioned above. His lyrics are cheesy and stupid, but I must admit that on 'Live and Let Die' he really proves that he is worthy of a G N' R frontman. Overall this album is good, but I recommend 'Use Your Illusion II' instead.

B00003CXC7|5.0|Why is Rear Window one of my favorite movies? Every time I see it I wonder and I come up with new things. One thing is outstanding and that is Jimmy Stewart. He is a photographer who broke his leg while on the job at a racing track. Strangely enough photos of the crash are in the opening scenes. Because he cannot move he is in his chair for the entire movie. The dialogue between him and his nurse is superb, especially the nurse has some great lines. <br />He is dating the beautiful Grace Kelly who he thinks is just to perfect for him but she doesn't seem to mind. The dialogue between them sounds like that between two people who have known each other for a while. Words that bystanders might find horrible but they are perfectly happy with. <br /> <br />While sitting in his chair Stewart has a chance to look outside his rear window at what is going on outside. There is a dancing lady, a composer, a sunbathing woman, a single woman and a just-married couple. This by the way for a long time was the biggest inside set ever built for a movie.  The thing he notices most however is a married couple and the story will be about them, since he thinks the man has killed the woman and is trying to get rid of the body everywhere. At first no one believes him, especially his friend a police officer. But the evidence gets more and more certain and more people start believing him, leading to a very tense end scene of the movie. This is of course, still a Hitchcock film. <br /> <br />The great thing is that even as a viewer you are convinced that Stewart is wrong, he just seems to be a sad wheelchair bound man that can't wait for another week before the cast can come off. He scratches himself with a backscratcher while making crazy assumptions based on the scarce things he sees at the other side.  <br /> <br />It's a very funny movie too and that is especially in the dialogues between the people. An example: Gunderson: It's about time you got married, before you turn into a lonesome and bitter old man. Jeff : Yeah, can't you just see me, rushing home to a hot apartment to listen to the automatic laundry and the electric dishwasher and the garbage disposal and the nagging wife...  Gunderson: Jeff, wives don't nag anymore. They discuss.  Jeff : Oh, is that so, is that so? Well, maybe in the high-rent district they discuss. In my neighborhood they still nag. <br /> <br />Rear Window is, together with North by Northwest, my favorite Hitchcock movie. It is well-acted, incredibly funny and of course has a great and unexpected ending.  <br /> <br />
B000002IVF|1.0|Have you ever wanted to hear a male vocalist attempt to rip off Joni Mitchell while using songs with no substance and terrible production?  Well this could be the album for you.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It seems, even to me, to call a t.v show, a work of art. But let's face it, that's what it is.  <br /> <br />I'll go back a couple of months. I knew nothing of Whedon's wit and wisdom, i was under the impression, BtVS sucked--i kinda liked the movie you see and learning years ago, that it was made into a t.v show, kinda freaked me. I would laugh in your face, if you told me, BtVS can stand in comparison with Citizen Kane. <br />Now, a devotee in the Whedonverse, i worship every little bit of whedon's work. Having watched Buffy, Angel on DVD--actually i have yet to see season 5, but i bet it rocks-- and Firefly (for which i had my doubts, but you must excuse me for that, 'cause i was only halfway into the Buffyverse) i can say for sure that Kubrick, Leone and Gilliam have found their match!  <br /> <br />So, that brings us to Firefly, a DVD totally worth its (amazon) price. Excellent dvd features--i still have to listen to a bunch of commentaries, but lemme tell you, Joss Whedon rocks, if you have listened to his Buffy commentaries and loved them... well let's say, you haven't HEARD nothin' yet(this being his commentary in Objects in Space)! Funny little gag-reel, although i'd love a huge gag-reel since i am sure there is one, Joss always has some rib tickling anecdotes to mention in his commentaries. And several other clips and documentaries, i don't really have much to say about those--NAthan Fillion's video is fun to watch etc--.  <br /> <br />The main feature: I suppose if you have come all the way to amazon, in order to buy the DVD, you must know or have seen the episodes. But anyways, a quick summary: Captain Reynolds and co-fighter Zoe Warren, are on the opposite side of the law, having lost some kind of intergalactic civil war, they become thiefs. They shape up their crew and battle for freedom and... cash! Moral ambiguity ensues(unlike Buffy's mission statement and morality, firefly moves to another level) , even the priest, of the ship, says at some point,that even if the bible is clear about killing people, it's fuzzy around the area of kneecaps...  <br />And to top all things, comes one of the single greatest episodes in the history of T.V, Objects in Space, for which you should really listen to the commentary(which i mentioned above) to completely comprehend its depth. And ofcourse great performances all the way round. I shall say nothing about how genius the writing is or how cool the visuals are, you already know that! <br /> <br />Plus, there are a lot of sex jokes, you know for the kids! ;)
B00008EY65|3.0|The only thing that kept me from really liking Hellboy, was the movie Hellboy.<br /><br />I've never read the actual comic that it's based on (I've heard it's quite good), but the movie is a dismal failure filled with lame dialogue, a confusing-at-best plot, and more wooden acting than a Pinocchio film festival!<br /><br />Hellboy could've been a fun character, but he just gets tiresome about a half hour after he comes on screen. Apparently he's got a thing for this woman who can summon fire bursts (convenient for all involved since he's fireproof), but their relationship is never really explained or explored in any real way. A sign a la silent movies reading \\"Our hero pines for his lady fair\\" would've been more effective than the approach taken by the script. One particularly tiresome scene involves Helloby taking love advice from a 9-year old boy while spying on the girl and another man from a rooftop and then pelting the man with a rock.<br /><br />My favoire character was the C3PO-ish Abe Sapian who was apparently some sort of merman with psychic abilities, but he gets hurt about two-thirds of the way through the movie and is never heard from again.<br /><br />The villians, Rasputin, some gas-masked nazi Wolverine knockoff (made of sand we find out later), and some woman hatch a plot to get Hellboy to open the gates of hell. At least that's what I was able to piece together after discussing the movie with my wife for almost a day afterwards. Some scraps of paper are involved and Hellboy's father figure is killed for some reason, but I never really understood what was going on.<br /><br />Most confusing was some creature that apparently spawned two more of itself after being killed being entirely wiped out at the end of the movie. How does that work anyway?! Shoudln't it have just created more as a result?! Again, it's never explained.<br /><br />Here's the thing - I love comic book movies! Spiderman? Great! Spiderman 2? Awesome! X-men 1 & 2? Oh baby! I even played hookie from work to see the Hulk when it came out. (A decision I later regretted, but that's another blog.) I was ready to really enjoy this! But in the end it's just two lame hours I can never get back. Damn you Hellboy! (Oh wait, too late!)! I even played hookie from work to see the Hulk when it came out.

0451169514|5.0|The epic King classic, It, is among his greatest works, surpassed only by The Dark Tower and The Stand.  It seamlessly chronicles the events in the lives of seven children who faced down a great evil in their youths, only to be called back to face it again to It's final death 27 years later.  But this is a condensed summary of a plot so intricate that it would require at least a 2 page essay to really explain, in terms of its underlying messages and themes, as well as its complex plot structure (for instance, there are often flashbacks of flashbacks).  The monster is really only a part of what this story entails.  If it was the main idea, the 1100 pages of the book wouldn't have been justified.  The theme that seems to strike most home with me is the magic that is possible in the eyes of children, and how that changes so much as we age.  I came away from this book feeling so wistful and nostalgic, that I was tempted to go riding full speed on my bike, never afraid of the consequences that I might fall and break something.  It made me stop and think about how much more complex our fears become as we become \\"grownups\\".   <br /> <br />In terms of the book's lengthy content, I will say that I was initially put-off.  King tends to take a character so far back into his past events that one sometimes begins to question the relavence of such an action.  But I realize that without such intricate weaving of character and plot, we would not have been given such richness.  We would not as closely identify the characters, care for them, or even think about them when the book is closed.  But every time I close It or any other King novel, I find that this is what I do.  I can't wait to pick the book back up again, to make sure everyone is okay.  King carries this off so well in this novel that I was almost afraid to keep reading because I dreaded anything bad happening to the people I'd invested so much time into caring about. <br /> <br />That being said, in terms of King's epicnovels, It still doesn't rank as #1 for me.  It took me a lot of time to warm up to this book.  I was about 300 pages into it before I really started to feel attached to it.  The Dark Tower and The Stand had me roped long before that, and it was only because of my intense appreciation for King's work that kept me reading beyond my cut-off limit.  I held on and had faith that all of it would come together and make sense.   <br /> <br />If there is any evidence people need to prove that Stephen King deserves to have an indellibe impression in the literary world- not just as a mainstream horror peddler, but a true literary talent- one need only pick up this book.  I can only think of a good handful of authors who are so good at pulling the reader into the story, and they all happen to be classic literary authors- Steinback, Twain, Dickens. Nuff said.
068987474X|2.0|While I think this book is witty, and perhaps even helpful to women with unusually low self esteem, Greg's so-called wisdom is simplistic to a fault. If Sex & The City taught one thing it's  that relationships are complex and take time. By urging women to keep up their defenses so high, this book kills love before it even has a chance to start.
B00009RAJH|4.0|I'll give her credit,  Christine Mcvie did whatever she could to try and make the Mac suck.  Sugar Daddy was probably her most ambitious attempt at that. <br />Other than that, you have a beautiful album that had very adventurous moments. <br />The bonus tracks however are extremely dissapointing.  Most of them are the single version of the big hits.  Give us demos, live performances, maybe an unreleased song, anything but single versions.
0448060191|5.0|I first read this book when I was 29 years old, and I was really quite amazed.  I was inspired to pick it up after seeing the opera \\"Little Women\\" by Mark Adamo, and I have to say that the book is really quite a lot better (and different, to my way of thinking) than the opera.   <br /> <br />Rather than being a ponderous, dull book, this was actually quite a good read.  It's straightforward, making it accessible to kids, but it held my interest as well.  There's not really a single well-defined plot, but rather a series of episodes in the characters' lives over several years, with a few common threads running through them. <br /> <br />This is the type of book I would like my children to read someday (boys or girls!).  Besides the obvious emphasis on family life, a very important underlying theme is an emphasis on virtue.  In each \\"episode\\", the girls (and the boys too) learn something, \\"build character\\", or increase in virtue in some way, and the lessons they learn carry through the rest of the book.  I found that incredibly refreshing in our post-modern age!  (Contrast with the common notion today that \\"personality\\" is a rather privileged, self-defined thing, and challenges or obstacles must be negotiated so that the character can basically maintain his or her own unique identity, warts and all).  Also an important theme in the book is finding our role in service to others - that we do not live simply according to our own whims and fancies.  Sometimes we have duties in life that may seem unpleasant, but it is in the performance of said duties that we find fulfillment. <br /> <br />*spoiler warning* <br />Another common theme that I see running through this is that, through their marriages, each of the characters is given the opportunity to become a better person.  So while we might wonder wistfully at what may have been with Laurie that Jo, in the end it is Amy that allows Laurie to grow into a virtuous and responsible man, and the Professor that allows Jo to movebeyond her own self-interest.  Similarly, Meg and John have a positive effect on each other, despite various trials. <br /> <br />Perhaps this all sounds very old fashioned.  The book is very clearly grounded in 19th Century Christian values.  But a look at this book suggests that such notions are still very relevant today!
038551123X|5.0|Darkly Dreaming Dexter, Delightful and Daring as he turned out to be, is another Wacko from the land of Wacko's...South Florida.  The novel is light for a serial killer work, and quite amusing as well.  Aside from the lame, soap opera ending, I enjoyed the story, the characters, and especially the accurate portrayal of South Floridians, especially the Miami Media.  Hiaasen fans will enjoy Dexter's dark humor as well as the references to Miami, however, Dexter can't quite capture the majic of Hiaasen's great character known as \\"Skink\\" or \\"Captain\\".  So buy both novels and compare!

B0002IQNAG|5.0|Anchor Bay's original releases of \\"Dawn Of The Dead\\" in the past were in the ratio of 1.66:1 and the new Ultimate Edition release showcases the aspect ratio in 1.85:1. <br /> <br />So, my question is this: <br /> <br />ARE WE GETTING MORE PICTURE THAN BEFORE, OR HAVE I BEEN SWINDLED ONCE AGAIN BY ANCHOR BAY IN, YET AGAIN, ANOTHER IMPROPER RATIO RELEASE?! <br /> <br />I'd appreciate the feedback from loyal fans.   :-)
B00005JNEI|1.0|Ever since my first magical viewing of Canadian Bacon, I knew Hollywood had something very special in Michael Moore...It's no surprise, therefore, that his latest motion picture experience is nothing less than sublime. Capturing the best elements of Reefer Madness, Birth of a Nation, and the works of Heinrich Himmler, Fahrenheit 9/11 has undoubtedly staked out its place in the annals of great documentary. <br />Prepare to have your presuppositions and values put to the fire in the cinematic pyromania that only Mr. Moore can supply. In addition to deconstructing the \\"lies\\" and \\"half-truths\\" that the proletariat have been brainwashed into accepting (via journalism, the Internet, rap music, personal experience, anecdotes), the true \\"people's champion\\" provides some startling revelations...For instance: <br /> <br />*There are TWO President Bushes!* <br />*During Saddam's reign, the Iraqi people lived in peace, flying kites* <br />*Most U.S. Congressmen cannot read* :( <br /> <br />Upon first hearing the title Fahrenheit 9/11, I have to admit I was a little skeptical. After all, Bradbury's book/film (trite account of utopian society where all books/independent thought are incinerated) of a similar name was a complete drag. But in true heroic fashion, Moore charges headlong into scandal, armed with nothing more than his girth, camcorder, legions of high-priced lawyers, and an ice cream truck. It's little wonder that some obscure British journalist called Mike \\"the most important living American.\\" Such valor would normally warrant a Congressional Medal of Honor or an induction into the Justice League...But alas, a right wing conspiracy is in effect...Maybe in a better time...a better place...Moore will receive his just desserts. Until then, we can count on our furry filmmaker pal to preserve truth, justice, and the Canadian way.
B000002MT0|4.0|Come sold poorly when it was released - in fact, it was probably his worst-selling album since his pre-superstardom days. I think only one single charted (Letitgo), and, if memory serves, it barely scraped the bottom of the top forty. Critics generally didn't think highly of it either. Prince had announced his retirement/name change prior to its release, so the assumption seemed to be that this was a throwaway, a contractual-obligation and no more. It may well have been given to Warners for that purpose, but to my ears Come is to date the most enjoyable record Prince has released since Sign O' The Times.<br />The strongest asset Come has is that it is relatively brief - the previous three Prince releases (Graffiti Bridge, Diamonds and Pearls and Symbol) were all very lengthy and bloated. The decent material on those records got lost in a sea of mediocrity. (To be fair, Prince was not unique in this regard - at the dawning of the CD era, most artists seemed to feel it was necessary to fill almost every minute available on a CD, and the end result was a lot of overly long, dreary records.) Come has ten songs and can be easily digested in one listening session.<br />Best of all, the core of the album is made up of concise, well-written songs - I think Space, Pheromone, Loose, Race, Dark and Letitgo are as worthy as anything Prince had committed to record since 1987. The Symbol album had as much quality material (if not more), but it got lost in the frustration of slogging through all the segues and duff tracks . Here, the strong material is not diluted.<br />Of the remaining tracks, Come is an overly long sex anthem (worth a listen if you need a laugh), Papa is perhaps the strangest and most disturbing Prince lyric yet, and Solo and Orgasm are dreadful. If you've passed by this release because you thought it was a bottom-tier Prince album, I'd strongly suggest giving it a try. I'll bet you'll be pleasantly surprised.
B0002I831S|2.0|I'm a Srek fan for as for back as I can remember and when Paramount issued Star Trek TOS entire first season, well I was overwhelmed. WhenIt finally came in the mail I had it opend before I made it through the door asd as I stood there in horror my heart sank faster than a starship in a decaying orbit. THEY DIDN\\"T PUT THE EPISODES IN AIRDATE ORDER!!! I almost fell out. I thought to myself how could they mess that up (not the word I want to use)I have to give this DVD 2 stars for that (FU) aside from that I love TOS and all the other series
B00030590I|3.0|A few other reviewers have touched on this, but I felt that, whatever its artistic merits might otherwise have been, the film was really tainted by its propagandistic message.  That message could hardly have been more obvious with respect to the Peoples' Republic of China's aims to re-absorb breakaway provinces like Hong Kong and Taiwan.  I thought it was particularly telling that the movie featured big Hong Kong movie stars like Jet Li, Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung, as if it were a direct message to the Hong Kong people to give up their dreams of autonomy for the \\"heroic\\" cause of unifying China, aka \\"Our Country.\\"  As such, the film is all about submitting to paternalistic political authority.  The emperor, a brutally ambitious historical figure, is depicted here as a wise, sensitive, but misunderstood idealist who sheds a tear at the thought that one of the assassins spared his life for the noble cause of unification (gosh, all he really wanted was to bring people together . . . how sweet!) <br /> <br />Artistically, too, I thought that the film wasn't up to the best efforts of Yang Zhimou, such as \\"Raise the Red Lantern.\\"  To me, it seemed a little unoriginal, as if it were a self-conscious blend of \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,\\" Kurosawa's \\"Rashomon\\" and even a colorful dash of \\"The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover\\" thrown in.  For all of its stunning visual beauty -- and it was truly spectacular in this regard -- it seemed a little soulless, as if grabbing the mantle from \\"Crouching Tiger\\" and setting a new standard for artistic martial arts movies were perhaps its main aim. <br /> <br />But all that aside, it was still a worthwhile effort, and a beautiful film to watch.  The acting was terrific, and in my opinion, Maggie Cheung and Zhang Ziyi are two of the most ravishingly beautiful and affecting actresses in the world.  It would be worth it alone to see their jealous fight scene with swirling golden leaves, swooshing and clanging swords, and a stunning hue shift to blood red as the loser dies at the climax.  Wow!  Too bad so much of the overall effect was spoiled by the shameless political pandering.
B00003CXCT|4.0|Yes, Lucas has fiddled with his movie once again. But we must remember, it is his movie. Lucas just wants to update the film so it is a more coheasive whole when the third one is finished. It is wierd seeing Hayden Christensen in the spot of the old Darth Vader in ROTJ but Lucas apparently had a reason for it. I don't think we should take offence of the changes in this version because we already know Lucas likes to change things. If we don't like this version the true fans still have the ORIGINAL (pre-Special Edition) Widescreen VHS versions of the trilogy...although it would be nice to see that version in DVD quality. I think most of the changes are for the better in this DVD version. The colors are more vibrant and the CG Jabba in \\"A New Hope\\" looks more textured...although I still don't really care for that scene. The only thing that is a little disappointing are the commentaries. I would have liked more actors to give their opinions and insights into the movie instead of Lucas rambling on about why he did this and justifying why he did that. I would have also liked to have had Lucas point out all the new stuff in this DVD version and why he did it. All in all, its a good DVD set, I just hope Lucas appeases all the old school Star Wars fans and releases his original movie trilogy on DVD. We can only hope.
B00007FOMP|5.0|I beleive Stevie Wonder is one of the greatest musicians/artist to ever live. And I love a lot of the greats. The Beatles, The Stones, Pink Floyd, Zeppilin, Elton, EWF, Clapton, Prince. And to tell the God's honest truth, I am not a huge fan of Marvin Gaye. But I'm not stupid and I know greatest when I hear it. AND THIS ALBUM IS GREAT! It is so great that it is the only album out of all of the albums from my list of favorite artist that I wish Stevie would have done! It is the only album that I would put side by side with Innervisions or Songs In The Key Of Life. Some people say that the similarity of the music/vibe of What's Goin' On makes it sound monotonous and sometimes boring. Well they are wrong. The vibe of the album is exactly what makes it as great as it is. It's an exquisite suite of songs all linked together by that certain vibe. And it's a great vibe at that. Jazzy yet spiritual at the same time, the music gives it an almost otherworldly feeling. Because of the \\"vibe linkage\\" of the album, separating it song by song doesn't really work. It's almost like the album is a long form art song. Some \\"songs\\" only last 1 or 2 minutes as if they are passages to the next segment. You do have the standouts that were actually able to be released as singles. The title song plus \\"Inner City Blues\\" and \\"Mercy Mercy Me\\" were all songs that from the first fews notes, you could tell that they all came from the same album. \\"What's Goin' On\\" is the main theme with \\"Mercy\\" sitting in the middle as a thoughtful prayer and then finally \\"Inner\\" closing it out with some final thoughts. Three great similar sounding songs with similar messages. Yet the music, melody and lyrics are so haunting that you can't help but love them. Other \\"thoughts/links\\" as I call them like \\"What's Happenin' Brother\\" and \\"God Is Love\\" are standouts in their own right and should not be overlooked. The beautiful \\"Save The Children\\" is heartwrenching as is \\"Wholly Holy\\". No resolution you say? Wrong. The resolution is given to us in the middle of the disc in \\"God Is Love\\" and \\"Save the Children\\". If we realize and Do what's mentioned in these little 1 to 2 minute snippets the world would be a MUCH better place. All in all, this is an album you must experience. Words can only try to desribe it. So, is it BETTER than Songs In The Key Of Life? Probably not. On Songs Stevie goes around the world when you talk about musical themes. Not one song sounds like the other. Is it BETTER than Innervisions? Probably not again. Musically speaking and performance wise, \\"Living For The City\\" alone blows away anything and everything on What's Goin' On. So why is this album so honored and praised? As I said before, you have to experience it to understand it. This is an album that gets to your bones and into your heart and mind. You have to love it and appreciate it. It is spirituality and pure love coming together to give birth to this, a child named What's Goin' On.
0553381709|5.0|Caution:  Spoilers ahead. I have been eagerly awaiting the fourth installment of this series.  1, 2 and 3 have been the most refreshing sci-fi fantasy that I have read in a long time.  Killing Robb and Lady Stark, as well as, the head of the Stark clan, was brilliant.  I couldn't believe they were dead.  Suddenly, your series left the beaten path of sci-fi writers and trekked off to blaze it's own trail.  No one was safe.  Oh, and I liked the sex.  Nice work.  However, a word of caution.  Please do not think to wander off into the 12-14 book series arena (think Robert Jordan).  I would hate to see this promising series end up like The Wheel of Time series.
B0002F6AYS|4.0|I thought the opening climax of this movie was the scarest part.The Diner scene.Could this movie happen?I say not.Think about it.The kids kill off all the adults in the town.5 years passed,how come some of the kids did'nt age in that time?And I think Credit Card companies would be wondering why no one in Gatlin is paying there Credit Card Bills?And how about TAX Bills!The IRS would be coming to town!You just cant wipe a town off the face of the earth with out any one noticing.Well this was a good movie and a lot better then those terrible sequels this movie spawned.Who was \\"He who walks behind the rows\\"? The Devil a demon?They never did say who it was.If you ask me,I think they should de a Children of the Corn prequel about \\"He Who Walks Behind the Row\\"?
B00029NMRM|3.0|This movie is the sequel to a really funny comedy (The Whole Nine Yards) that was full of intrigue and had a cast that worked extremely well together!  While most of the same cast is in The Whole Ten Yards, I had significant trouble following the story and was very disappointed in the characters.  The lovable former hitman 'Jimmy the Tulip' played by Bruce Willis - was just awful - he wasn't funny or likable - which is just not Bruce Willis.  Matthew Perry as the bumbling dentist is stilted and unbelievable and even Jill (Amanda Peet) who was a really cool hitman wannabe in the first movie - became a total incompetent.<br /><br />I really hate to say it, but this film is almost embarrassing to watch - at a minimum it has a very hard-to-follow story line.  While there are some good parts, they are few and far between.<br /><br />If you want to watch it just because you really enjoyed the first one - I say, \\"go for it\\"!  But, if you haven't seen the Whole Nine Yards yet - definitely go watch that one instead!
B0000CNY27|5.0|Kurt Russel and John Carpenter make a great team, and if anybody didn't know they have done four movies with each other, and all of them are great except the sequel to this movie.  Anyway this movie is extremely unusual and I think ahead of its time.  I think the idea of using New York city as one big prison was a pretty cool idea.  And they could have picked no other awesome actor than one of my favorites, Kurt Russel, who fit the bill perfect.  As snake who is a pretty cool anti hero which I think the best kind of hero.  This movie has some pretty cool characters and some pretty weird ones too, but all around this movie has good action and some really good visuals.  Check it out.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I don't want to write a book because so many others have already pointed out all the damages to this \\"once upon a time\\" masterpiece. Ok I will anyway, computer erased actors for the sake of continuity with three new and inferior films. RE-RECORDED sound effects/audio everything from monster roars to new dubbed in dialogue for C3PO, Darth Vader etc etc etc... Even the original music seems remixed under the action. It's completely lost its charm... I absoloutely HATE them and have been complaining to anyone around me who'll listen. Actually audio wise \\"A New Hope\\" is almost unwatchable I had to switch off the 5.1 it doesn't work. It sounds like old audio jumping back and forth between new over dubbed audio or something really awful and distracting!!  <br /> <br />There is an old old saying, \\"IF ISN'T BROKEN, DON'T FIX IT!!!!\\"  <br /> <br />Well George its time to give your old fans, the ones who made your career, a break and re-release the original UNTAMPERED versions of these films. Even as a limited edition box set seperate from all this CGI garbage (hell its even more money for you anyway!). We don't want this. You changed our lives with breath taking films 20 odd years ago you can't go back. Its territory you already conquered so what's the point??
B00005JNBQ|5.0|One of the earlier reviewers did an excellent job of critiquing the frequently clueless Roger Ebert for his complete misunderstanding of this character and this movie.  Napoleon is a rural supernerd who doesn't want or need the acceptance of those around him.  He doesn't long to be popular, he doesn't really care what people think of him, he just wants the space to be himself.  <br /> <br />What's great about the character is that Naploen doesn't really change at all through the course of the movie.  Sure, he helps a friend win a student election and manages to find a girl; but these are the result of Napoleon being who he is, not because he changed or grew into something else.  He starts the movie as an almost monotonal, oblivious, strangely dressed little boy - and that's exactly how he is at the end of the movie.  He doesn't even seem to realize it, but he's changed a lot of the people around him.  Pedro gets some self confidence, Deb finds a guy who accepts her, Kip is happy, and even uncle Rico manages to stumble into a good deal. <br /> <br />Not that I care one way or the other, but the movie manages to be enormously entertaining without resorting to potty humor or wholesale swearing even once.  An impressive feat considering the status quo of \\"comedies\\" these days. <br /> <br />My only gripe would be with the \\"extra\\" scene that was added in after the credits when the movie started earning some bucks.  It really just seems tacked on and kind of pointless.  I would have rather seen a few more minutes at the chicken farm, or some time spent showing how Rico met his girlfriend, or even some more of Napoleon as the biggest kid on the school bus. The tetherball game was the perfect ending for this movie, and nothing was gained by the addition of the new post-credits scene. <br />  <br />If you want something to compare it to, it carries a lot of the same pleasantly deluded loser vibe that \\"Bottle Rocket\\" had, along with a similarly great soundtrack.  It's a greatdate movie, and a superior original low-budget comedy. <br /> <br />Now if I can only get my hands on a D-Qwon's Dance-grooves VHS, I'll be OK.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Well, the long anticipated DVD release of the Star Wars Trilogy has arrived. George has altered the films more than he already did with the Special Edition, but the changes aren't so bad.<br /><br />For starters, the now infamous Cantina scene with Greedo and Han has been changed again. Now, rather than Greedo shooting first (as it was in the Special Edition), or Han shooting first (as it was in the original), they fire at the same time.<br /><br />Also, the fugly emperor in Empire Strikes Back was replaced with Ian MacDirmid, who played Palpatine in RotJ and the Prequals. Some unnecessary dialog has been added, and lessens a little of the suprise with Vader's Revelation in ESB, but otherwise, the addition isn't quite so bad. Boba Fett's dialogue has been re-recorded,, but it's barely noticible.<br /><br />In RotJ, the changes are once again negligible. The actor who played Anakin at the end of ROTJ is replaced with Heydin Christiansen. Otherwise, I didn't notice any changes.<br /><br />The fourth DVD contains a feature documentary about the making of the Star Wars Trilogy - no, not a Featurette, like you're used to, but a full feature that's about the length of a film. The documentary \\"The Empire of Dreams\\" plots out the full story of the making of the Star Wars films. The documentary is very insightful and entertaning, as are the other feature documentaries on the DVD.<br /><br />In conclusion, I firmly reccomend a purchase of these DVDs. They are worth every penny of your purchase.
B000002MU3|2.0|For all the talk about how this album pushed the envelope of alternative rock (or at least redefined R.E.M.'s place in the genre), this CD is pretty pedestrian.  It contains none of the charm of R.E.M.'s other recordings, and it is notably lacking in depth.<br /><br />Beyond that, it's just not enjoyable, and that has very little to do with R.E.M.'s genre-spanning style.  This is a band that has always refused to coast on previous successes; they have always challenged their listener's expectations and explored different instrumentations; but they've also always managed to produce great-sounding music. That's why it worked; the bottom line is, if you don't want to listen to it, music loses its impact.  Hence the problem here.  If you set iTunes to play all of R.E.M.'s songs, you'll pretty much never hear the same thing twice--unless Monster's on that list.  With a few exceptions (Crush with Eyeliner, Strange Currencies, Bang and Blame), there is a lot of sameness on this album.<br /><br />Whether you're new to the band, or you're a fan of one of R.E.M.'s other periods and are looking to get into their \\"transition\\" phase, do yourself a favor: pass this one by and pick up New Adventures in Hi-Fi. While not the band's best, it offers a sampling of what R.E.M. may have been trying to do with Monster; their efforts are much more successful the second time around.  Hi-Fi is far superior to Monster... the only R.E.M. album (out of all 17) I simply cannot listen to.
0393035158|5.0|It has always amazed me that around 99% of the human race goes about their daily lives believing things about the world that don't stand up to one minute's serious anlaysis. Yet the vast majority of people never question these beliefs, out of fear, cowardice or plain stupidity. <br /> <br />Thank you Sam Harris for a brave and vital work, that at long last puts into words what the other 1% understands. I have to admit that I am as pessimitic as Harris about whether amyone is listening, but it still has to be said.  <br /> <br />A fabulous book that everyone should read - and if you don't agree with the central argument, then please come up with a better argument for why you believe what you do. The human race simply has to move on from these ancient mythologies if we are to survive. It won't be long before 'an eye for an eye' can be executed on a global scale, at the touch of a button, by any crazed zealot, drunk on the prospect of reward by some imagined supernatural power. (And, yes, I include George Bush in that category - what's the difference?)
B00003CXCT|5.0|I've heard alot of negative reviews and comments about the recent release of the Star Wars Trilogy on DVD, but Star Wars fans rejoice, the original Star Wars, in their theatrical version will be released seperately on DVD shortly after the release of Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, to coinside with the release of the new Star Wars film.  The DVD releases will offer the original versions (untouched by current special effects) and the special edition versions on 2 DVD sets for each film.  Email me for web address info.  Don't worry Star Wars fans, the original Star Wars is in our galaxy not to far into the future!!!!
B00003CXCT|2.0|Sure, it looks fantastic on DVD, but that's about as far as it goes. The biggest disappointment was that I actually thought I was buying the \\"Star Wars\\" Trilogy. Silly Me... <br />Instead I end up buying \\"CGI for the sake of having CGI\\" and irrelevant and irritating changes that only serve for continuity with over-hyped inferior byproduct revenue-raising films. <br />I'm sorry, but they didn't even use Hayden Christensen in the end of \\"Jedi\\", they used some guy that had a vague resemblance to him instead. Pathetic really... <br />George, get your head out that place that the sun don't shine, and give the fans what they actually want, cleaned up ORIGINAL Star Wars.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This has got to be one of the best movies I have ever seen.  I was laughing the entire time.  <br /> <br />If you have not seen this movie (limited theater release initially) you definitely should buy this DVD!!! <br /> <br />
B00019PDKC|5.0|I can't understand how something can be so beatiful yet you can't touch it, that's how i feel about Anathema's music in this album and in A Fine Day to Exit, whenever i listen to Are you there?, Flying or Electricity i get this feeling that i can't explain it also brings so many memories, how can such a slow song bring this ruch of feeling to one's mind?
B0002V7ODI|5.0|Hellboy is a great movie.  It follows the story of a unique hero, played extraordinarily well by Ron Perlman, in his attempts to not only save the world, but in his quest to become as human as possible.  The movie starts off great, never stales and ends with a great scence, where Hellboy kisses his love interest while engulfed in flame.  This movie is filled with great characters, villians, humor and action.  Unlike Spiderman 2, Hellboy does not try to outdo itself.  Instead its efforts focus on developing and fully appreciating its characters.  Hellboy would rather make a joke than swing through the streets of New York and somehow it acheives more than the latter.  I would very much like to recommend this flick.
B000003Z6I|5.0|A number of people have been discussing the cover track \\"In the Ghetto.\\"  Keep in mind that that track is a bonus track included for the CD re-release.  The original album from 1984 just included seven songs: Avalanche, Cabin Fever!, Well Of Misery, From Her To Eternity, Saint Huck, Wings Of Flies, and A Box For Black Paul.  Several years later, the CD came out and added three bonus tracks:  \\"In the Ghetto\\" (a 1984 single), its b-side \\"The Moon is in the Gutter,\\" and the 1987 version of \\"From her to Eternity\\" which is from the soundtrack to the movie \\"Wings of Desire.\\" <br />
B0002KPIQY|5.0|The best film yet, Angelina jolie really shows the story of the model Gia Marie Carangi. Its very tragic and sad, and she had it all. She had money, fame, any guy or girl, but she didn't had love from whom she wanted. If you want more info e-mail me at JJ_025@lycos.com
B00024I2Z4|4.0|Being a Chinese, I really appreciate the efforts put into this movie. Most of the movie is accurate to the old tale that my mother told me when I was a young girl. Especially Mulan's strive to prove that she could be more than just a helpless girl waiting to be married into a wealthy family. This story has been staged in many Chinese operas. Mom's version has it that nobody discovered Mulan's true identity until the captain decided to visit Mulan after the war. <br /> <br />Naturally mom's version did not include a wisecracking dragon, but it was a welcome addition. The up-to-date jokes made it an easier story to comprehend. <br />
B00003CXZ1|5.0|This film has everything, drama, love, action, betrayal and more. It's the best film. Angelina jolie was born to be Lara Croft. If you want more info on the film or if you are interested in the Angelina Jolie Newsletter or tomb raider Newsletter e-mail me at jj_025@lycos.com
0671027344|5.0|After reading through some of the reviews, it seems like you'll either love or hate this book. <br />Personally, I loved this book.  There was something about it that captured me from the moment I picked it up till the moment I put it down (I read it all in one sitting too). <br />There are so many lines in this book that were just wonderful.  The songs that he talks about are also pretty amazing.  I downloaded all of the songs he mentioned and created my own \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" soundtrack. <br />I'm planning on giving the book to a friend of mine and highlighting one line in particular... it sums up everything I've been wanting to say to him in just one line.  =) <br />It's a beautiful book, and I think anyone can enjoy it (even if it is directed towards a younger audience).
B00005JMCW|5.0|Great film about a mother and daughter who don't understand each other. If you are a disney fan you will love this movie. If you want more info e-mail me at JJ_025@lycos.com
0064407667|3.0|The premise is certainly attractive: three siblings, cast adrift in the world, surrounded by malevolent forces. And the grown-ups won't listen.<br /><br />The style just never engaged me, though. The little asides to explain what words meant - they just looked patronizing. There was lots more, like what's with the eyes? I hoped the author would at least give us a clue, but no. They're weird, they appear around that one individual, then he runs off.<br /><br />Harry Potter set the bar pretty high. I can't expect every writer to reach that level, but I can still be disappointed when they don't. The series has become so popular that there must be something in there that I'm just not getting. After reading this book, though, I'm just not tempted to hunt it down.<br /><br />//wiredweird
0471463396|2.0|Half of the book is a history of several value investors.  But this section is quite superficial in how these individuals screened/found the opportunities they did.  Little is told of how they valued the companies and how a wanna-be investor should procede in doing this themselves.  The first half of the book is ok, but again could use more help in terms of how to find prospective value companies.  Chapter 6 is about the only good chapter. It analyses WD-40 (the company).  I recommend instead \\"The Intelligent Investor\\" (2003 ed.) by the late Ben Graham and Jason Zweig.  It lives up to Buffett's praise of \\"...by far the best book about investing ever written.\\"
B00005JNEI|5.0|What the heck is everyone's problem with this film? I hear some people saying that it's lies and that it doesn't show the facts. Even though, most of the people haven't seen the film. Let me tell you something this film will you give more facts than Bush and his adminstration will give you. That man has been giving us lies from the very beginning. This film is very less funny and moore like than any of his films. This is much darker, disturbing, and truthful. And he has whole bunch of lawyers and fact checkers to prove it. It may seem too simple to believe that Bush would ever go to war for oil in Iraq. But really what else could it be, WMDS, nope. Iraq-al-quauda connection. Yeah whatever. The only connection the al-quada has is with the saudi arabia. And the Bush family have connections with the saudi's. So really...what else could it be? All I have to say is this film is probably the most important film ever. GO see it. Trust me it's not propaganda. See it and decide for yourself.
0060555661|5.0|Zweig takes the classic book by Ben Graham (Intelligent investor, 1949 -- updated and rewritten several times) and adds lots and lots of commentary.  Every other chapter is Zweig.  Almost every page has a Zweig comment on something Graham says.  If you are a Graham fan and CAN read his work easily (very tough for me, as he reads like Winston Churchill) you will find Zweig annoying ... but if you are moderately versed in value investing terminology but not an expert, you'll find his \\"translation\\"/commentary very helpful.  Zweig also gives lots of modern examples of how with value investing, the Graham way, investors could have avoided the recent bubble burst.
B00000JQFM|5.0|I am writing this review from the persepctive of someone who does not play any instruments or has any talent in that field. If you are a guitarist and do not have this yet, get it! For those of you who are like me, I am a fan of hard rock and enjoy an amazing guitar solo. Yet this album is different than anything from Yngwie Malmsteen because Satriani does not use his solos to just show off his talents, he actually uses them to improve and add to the song as well. And there is none of that eccentric crap that is synonomous with Steve Vai's great works. <br />The album is set up like a normal rock album and starts out with the title track, which grows on you fast but gets old fast too. The rest of the album has slower rockers \\"Ice 9,\\" ballads like \\"Always with Me, Always with You\\" and more heavy rockers like \\"Crushing Day.\\" The highlight is probably the song, \\"Circles\\" which stars out quiet and then has a heavy 1:25 long guitar solo, then quiets down again; great stuff. <br />This album is for anyone who enjoys hard rock or amazing guitar playing. Highly recommended.
B00006BTCA|3.0|Turn On The Bright Lights is a debut album which displays glimpses of promise yet falls short of a tour de force. <br /> <br />The last track \\"Leif Erikson\\" is a perfect example of this. They are really onto something here with its gorgeous melody and affecting vocals on the first two-thirds of the track, and then it disappointingly slips into an anticlimactic finale. <br /> <br />Interpol sounds to me like they are a band trying (too hard?) to find their way. I get the impression that the chemistry within the group is being painstakingly manufactured rather than occurring naturally. <br /> <br />If the usual things which destroy bands that taste success doesn't eat away at Interpol then I am hopeful that they will deliver on the potential of \\"Turn On The Bright Lights.\\" <br /> <br />I'm intrigued enough to go for the ride. <br />
B0002IU988|5.0|This is a high tribute to the lead guitarist art.If you play guitar you will know what I mean, Find the Real,May be one of the best Cuts I have ever heard. The vocals are amazing,The Guitar wheels and soars on the wings of the Song The heavy bass, Is just right, The Lead it flys, and weeps to the music. <br /> There is not a bad cut on this CD,fast or slow, all I can say , is More....I want more. <br /> No matter what Genre you like.Hard Rock, Rock,This is a must,I can see numerous Single releases from this CD.
0679731725|5.0|The Japanese always has an objective and incisive view of his conditions and the particular issues realating his life. Clearly Ishiguro has inherited this and has acquired such a mastery over the language of his adopted country that the product of the confluence is of a rare breed in every sense. The butler analyses his job, the criteria that evolve to define excellence, his relationships and the scopes therein and definitely the limitations one inevitably faces in oneself in resolving these issues. But then justification of one's effort and purest intent comes in the form of DIGNITY, the ultimate and only mark of acknowledgement whether from inside or from outside. Ishiguro explores the aspects of its perception, evolution and its role in the context of different individuals and societies. The helpless limitations of life, human communicability at the end gives way to the acceptance of bantering as something legitimate even to an orthodox traditionalist like the butler. That comedy necessarily has its root in tragedy is possibly being uttered once again in this book, but in what a delectably novel manner! This is literature, an endless source of renewal!
B00003CXCT|4.0|Why do people get so carried away about how good or bad Star Wars is?  Or as to what George Lucas does to change the movies?  These movies are good because they tell a good story, not because they make some kind of monumental political or ethical statement.  If you want politics or ethics, I highly suggest reading and watching DUNE.  If you want sheer entertainment with a good sci/fi gleen, then go with Star Wars.  The only reason why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars was that I just didn't like the packaging.  They should have just packaged it as a straight box set like the Indiana Jones movies instead of having all of that excessive paper around the edge of the box.  The set does redeem itself with the individual DVDs as the art on the boxes and the discs are very vivid and colorful.  The sound of the DVDs is really good.  I really like the remastering in THX.  Also, the picture didn't look too fuzzy or sharp, and the color was very crisp, even for movies which are over twenty years old.  <br />These movies have become modern classics, and have to be included in any serious DVD collection.  May the force be with you!
B00005UWBQ|3.0|Once again we have a visit to the island of the dinosaurs by a scientific team who expects to exploit their discoveries. They know what they're doing, they assure us (ironically?). The computer generated images have been improved. But a larger expedition arrives to capture the wild lizards and create a zoo in San Diego (remind you of 'King Kong'?). There seems to be an anti-hunting message in some of these scenes, Its OK for reptiles, but not for mammals? <br /> <br />Of course, another wonderful plan goes awry due to unforeseen events. The small group sabotages the efforts of the larger group (professional rivalry?). As if they don't have enough problems, a small wounded lizard is brought inside for treatment. But there wouldn't be any drama without these missteps. This story seems incredible in spots, but I'm not a biologist. The action is a true cliff-hanger! This climb for life is the most riveting scene. <br /> <br />The destruction of the camp forces the survivors to a long day's journey to the old settlement. One straggler gets lost to create an episode of horror. More problems occur crossing the grassy meadow at night; do the lights attract predators? The refuge at the settlement becomes a trap. But they escape, and are rescued by a helicopter! The military arrive, like the Cavalry in bygone Westerns, to rescue the remaining survivors.  <br /> <br />A ship arrives in San Diego, with no live humans. (Does this recall a scene from 'Dracula'?) And so the captured Tyrannosaurus arrives without a visa, another immigrant in Southern California. This one won't disappear easily! The scenes with the dinosaur running wild in the streets is technically impressive. In the end the financier is used to teach the young dinosaur to hunt for its food, another ironic ending. The final interview warns against interfering with nature. Is this an argument against cloning and stem cell research? <br /> <br />
B00005JN7O|4.0|\\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\" is essentially a comic book in a movie format with a stupendous array of computer graphics but a somewhat thin plot.<br /><br />The movie begins with an awesome graphic of the dirigible Hindenburg docking atop the Empire State Building in a snowstorm in the 1930's.  A German scientist and sole survivor of a group of scientists involved in secret experiment after WW I in Berlin is a passenger.  He has some information to divulge and calls to meet with New York Chronicle reporter Polly Perkins, played nicely by the deco garbed Gwyneth Paltrow.  Soon after they meet the city is attacked by gigantic flying robots apparently searching for some generators located there.  Sky Captain Joe Sullivan played dashingly by Jude Law is summoned to save the day and damsel in distress Paltrow.<br /><br />Law is the leader of a mercenary air force and is aided by his second in command, mechanical genius Dex Dearborn played by the talented, entertaining and flaky Giovanni Ribisi.  Soon Law and Paltrow collaborate to solve the plot which involves the usual goal of world destruction.  They had learned that a brilliant German scientist Dr. Totenkopf, played by a computer generated Laurence Olivier, the creator of the secret experiment is behind the annihilation of the Earth with his army of robots.  Their investigation leads them to far reaching exotic worldwide locations.<br /><br />\\"Sky Captain\\" is an entertaining romp but it's never fully explained as to the motivation of Totenkopf to destroy the world.  The acting was decent with Paltrow and Ribisi leading the way.  Angelina Jolie playing Captain Franky Cook was ridiculous with her phony English accent and eye patch and added little to the plot.
0553571338|3.0|This book is definitely worth your time to stop and read.  Lois Lowry has created this brilliant novel about a young boy in a world where order rules everything.  As the plot unravels, you start to realize some of the things that you have taken for granted in our world of imperfection.  You are introduced to a community where your life is planned out and free-will is no longer existent.  As you finish this novel, you will be questioning whether or not you could thrive in a world like that.  If you value your individuality, then you will more than likely enjoy reading this book.
1565114582|1.0|I wish I read negative reviews on this book more careful before buying it.   <br />I might have got couple of useful ideas from it, I still need to see if they prove to be useful, other than that it is been waste of time and money.   <br />The tone of the book is annoyingly condescending.  The author seems to be not very well educated but irritatingly opinionated on all matters.  When you should feed your baby, how much, how long.  Her division of babies by temperament into four groups is very primitive and not helpful to anything.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Star Wars in it's first debut on DVD is great, but there are somethings that have ruined it for me. <br /> <br />Star Wars IV A New Hope: It look great restored, but that scenes that have been added don't belong. The Empieral Troopers investigating the pod riding on those creatures...it doesn't look good. You can tell they were just thrown in here because they don't look like they were made in 1977. Also the scene with Jabba the Hut, I think it kinda ruined the look of Jabba. You can tell he is compeltely computer generated.  I rate this DVD 4 1/2 stars <br /> <br />Star Wars V The Empire Strikes Back: There is nothing in this one of that bothers me, it looks great on DVD.  I rate this DVD 5 stars <br /> <br />Star Wars VI Return of the Jedi: This is my favorite of the three Star Wars films. Like Empire it looks great on DVD and I thought there wasn't going to be hardly any changes, but at the end,...whoa!...the kid from Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones was there instead of the original guy for Darth Vader. Completely caught me off guard. The added parts in this DVD, I couldn't tell there was any, until my sister pointed them out. They work great. I rate this DVD 5 stars,...because I forgive them about the end, because it makes sense, because of the new trilogy. <br /> <br />Bonus DVD: This is great! It has a huge documentary \\"Empire of Dreams\\" that explains how George Lucas came up with the idea and the making of the rest of the original Star Wars Trilogy. It also gives you the trailers and tv spots of the three films...and it also gives you a sneek peak into EPISODE III <br /> <br />Over all, I think George Lucas did a good job with the Star Wars Trilogy's DVD debut. Even though there was a few minor changes some more noticable than others. I THINK THEY ARE A GREAT BUY.
0451205146|4.0|This book truly proves that war is no game. Where fear is always on the move.<BR> The book was a powerful aspect of the men who died in Somalia, carfully scripted and studied that it proved WHY the Somali's attacked the Americans.<BR> This book earned my respect and I reccommend to ANYONE. <BR> Even if you are the romantic person, this book will move you deeply.
B00004LN16|4.0|Three things you can count on in life...death, taxes and AC/DC. They never change, never experiment, never grow, yet they do this without becoming boring. Neat trick! The quality is consistent as well...somewhere between good to excellent. This album falls under 'very good'. Standout tracks are \\"I Feel Safe in NYC\\" and the single \\"Stiff Upper Lip\\". Long live Angus!
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|i bought this cd on a whim because i had heard their single \\"take me out\\" and it intrigued me. i put it in my cd player and it blew me away. even the flow of the cd, the order of the tracks, is perfect. there is no song on this cd that i don't throroughly enjoy. their sound is refreshing and new and they have already made it to the top ranks of my favorite cds. i think everyone should give this cd a good listen and i promise you'll be hooked.
B000000WIG|3.0|This is Moore's 1992 follow-up to \\"Still Got the Blues\\". Very similar. Best track is the simply amazing \\"Story of the Blues\\" with some outstanding guitar work. Another standout number is a Little Milton song called \\"The Blues is Alright\\" with Albert Collins sharing vocals and guitar. B.B. King also appears on one song.
B000002JKA|4.0|This is a very good album but it still seems a little overrated <br />to me, or at least some tracks are over rated. 6:00 is an ok song but I think it is the most overrated song on this album by far, it does sort of set the mood for the rest of the disc nicely but that is about it. But for every \\"average\\" song there is a good one, like caught in a web, voices, erotomania, space-dye vest, and more. Overall I liked about half of the songs on this album and the rest are still decent songs so this a good buy.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This show is amazing. It has so much detail that you can watch it many times without catching everything. It has the same kinds of great relationships Joss Whedon did so well in Buffy and Angel but it's more realistic. The dialog is zippy, but because the series is set 500 years in the future, it doesn't have the overdose of pop culture references those shows had. But it doesn't need them. Firefly is an incredibly well thought-out universe. If you like sci-fi at all, you will love this show. And, as will all Joss shows, the DVD commentaries are hilarious.  And be sure to catch the upcoming movie Serenity based on this show,(...)
B00005QJDG|5.0|Seriously, everybody, just think about what's on this.  You get Dream Theater's best album, Metropolis Part II: Scenes From a Memory in it's entirety, and getting it played perfectly.  You also get the only live version of the masterpiece that is A Change of Seasons ever released, and getting A Change of Seasons live is worth 20 bucks alone, and same goes for getting Scenes From a Memory live.  Together is phenomenal already.  Wait a minute, there's more?  That's right.  There are 11 more songs that I haven't mentioned.  Included is (in my opinion) the best version of Metropolis Part I: The Miracle And The Sleeper, live or recorded.  Also, you get all three parts to A Mind Behind Itself, the musical trilogy from Awake, and I believe all three parts live are also not found anywhere else.  Best of all, they only play one song from Falling Into Infinity (New Millennium), and it is one of the two good songs from that album (the other being of course Lines in the Sand).   <br /> <br />Let me sum this up for you: You get two albums in their entirety (A Change of Seasons is the only original song on that album), the best version of Metropolis Part I ever released, and probably the most fan-based setlist to be found on a DT live album (If you talked to a DT fan, they'd say that Awake is one of the best albums, and Falling Into Infinity is one of the worst.  You get tons of songs from Awake and one from FII).  And, yes, a keyboard solo from Jordan Rudess, who I think is the best out of the three keyboardists in DT's history (though Kevin Moore and Derek Sherinian are of course both very good). Sacrifice 20 bucks and check this out.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I don't really know much about Green Day except for its earlier hits from Dookie. I just heard so much about this album I HAD to check it out. I was not disappointed. The tracks move smoothly from one to another. It really does feel like the whole CD is taking you on a journey. I'm so glad that there are still albums out there that care about the format of a CD as a whole (rather than just a few singles thrown together with filler tracks). <br /> <br />Favorite tracks would have to be, \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams,\\" \\"American Idiot,\\" \\"Jesus of Suburbia (the whole set),\\" \\"Wake Me Up When Semptember Ends.\\" But the whole CD is good overall.
B000268QB2|5.0|I know, Van Morrison is not dead but is Tom Chaplin and early reincarnation of him.  Could be but this time he gave him a voice from heaven.  I have read a lot of Keane's reviews.  Where does the anger come from?  Did Coldplay, Travis or whoever invent music.  Everyone gets there influence from someone else unless you were the first person to ever write music or you hear music never heard before from your inner voices.  It is nice to relate them to someone else but have you heard anything this good in the last 5 years?  Last 10 years?  Good Luck with that.  Lets just say that this is the best stuff that I have heard in a long, long, long time.  Here is my top three of just good music since year 2000.  3. Evanescence 2. The Thorns  1. Keane .  GO ahead and debate me on this but Keane is going to be up there pretty high.  I hear a lot of other bands in Keane.  I see the references that you wrote and I hear them too but you reference awesome bands.  I don't see references to bad music like New Kids, the Ramones or Skid Row.  You wrote the Beatles and ELO.  Hey, how about The Raspberries.  Get off the my band Travis or my band Coldplay or whatever came first.  Copycat.  What are you 5 years old.  Maybe YOUR band had that sound first but it didn't sound this good.  When is the last time you picked up a CD and you just HAD to listen to it over and over.  That is how I feel about this CD.  Some of these songs made the hair on my neck stand up.  It gave me chills and made me feel like I was 20 all over again.  Some of the songs made me feel isolated and alone which scared me.  The music and lyrics are moving in many way.  It makes sense to call it hopes and fears.  I usually put a new cd in the rotation in my car.  This cd by Keane is not in a rotation with anything.  It is the only thing that is playing in my vehicle right now.  I don't need that 6 disc player for now.  Keane is spinning by itself these days.  I bought this CD three days ago and I am already anticipating the next by them.
B00006RINF|4.0|I was originally going to title this review, \\"The predecessor to Evanescence?\\" but then I looked at the other reviews (as well as Our Customers' Advice) and realized that that has been said several times before. Basically, I remember catching the video for \\"Swamped\\" earlier this year on an episode of All Things Rock on MTV2. But since I don't get to watch as many videos as I used to, I thought that all they showed were new videos, thus I figured it was a new song (which in turn prompted me to put it on one of my recent rock albums -- oops!). Anyway, I checked out this album and it's great.<br /><br />This album from Italy's own Lacuna Coil isn't one of those hard rock albums full of screaming, loud guitars and not much else. There are very introspective storytellings to be found, like \\"The Prophet Said\\", \\"Angel's Punishment\\" and especially \\"The Ghost Woman and the Hunter\\". And the good musical craftsmanship will keep you wanting more, as evidenced by listening to \\"Humane\\". Although that song is close to four minutes long, after it was done I said, \\"Aw, is it over already?\\" But \\"Swamped\\" is still my favorite song on the album.<br /><br />I gave the album four stars because a few of the songs sound the same (\\"Swamped\\", \\"Heaven's a Lie\\" and \\"Entwined\\"). Oh well, that doesn't stop the album from being great. While it took me two years to discover Comalies (and Lacuna Coil), I'm still glad I did because as they say, better late than never.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
1593080050|3.0|Before reading this book, I thought I had a fairly good understanding of what it was about (which is primarily why I was hesitant to actually read it).  A mad scientist somehow created a monster in his lab.  The monster, commonly (however, incorrectly) referrred to as Frankenstein, had green skin, was about seven feet tall, had bolts in his neck etc.  And I recalled something about him being pursued through the streets by an angry fire-wielding mob.<br /><br />What surprised me most about this book is how little of what I had always heard about it was actually true.  The monster that most people refer to as Frankenstein actually has no name.  He was created by a man whose last name is Frankenstein.  There is a brief description of him, but no mentioning of neck bolts or green skin.  Furthermore, there is no scene where a mob of people chases after him with fire.  This was not, as I had previously been lead to believe, a horror novel.  It is, rather, a book dealing with the themes of love, desire, acceptance, ignorance, resentment and revenge.<br /><br />The following is a brief summary of the plot, so if you don't want to know what this is about I would advise you to not read this portion of my review:  Frankenstein (the scientist, not monster) is a man deeply interested in science.  One day he discovers how to give life to inanimate objects, and decides to assemble a being from various body parts.  When he imparts this creature with life he is horrified at what he has created and flees.  It isn't long before the \\"monster\\" learns that all people are horrified and appalled by his existence, and is driven to live in the woods.  He ends up living outside of a family's home where he is able to observe them through a window.  Through his observation, he is able to learn to speak and read perfect English.  He feels a love for this family who are completely oblivious to his existence and feels a deep desire to establish a relationship with them.  When he finally gets up the courage to meet them, they are of course terrified of him and drive him away.  Sometime after this, the monster, devastated by humanity's unwillinglness to accept him and filled with resentment towards his maker who has forsaken him, decides to lash otu in revenge toward Frankenstein.  He systematically kills off Frankenstein's family one by one.  It then becomes Frankenstein's only goal in life to eradicate the menace he created.<br /><br />This book is surprising in that it didn't really seem like a horror novel at all.  Sure, the monster is composed of the body parts of corpses, but he is very much a human character, complete with a full spectrum of emotions.  He desires love and companionship from human beings just like we all do, but he is denied this.  This is a sad story, but not at all scary.  The writing style is very unique in that it is extremely non-descriptive.  In a way, I think that is a good thing.  I've read far too many books that are too long-winded.  This book is concise and to the point.  The author did not use twenty pages to describe the look of the monster's left toenail.  With so little detail, this book does require a little imagination but there's nothing wrong with that.  Overall, it's a decent read but doesn't seem to have held up too well over time.  I imagine that when this book was released it actually was considered scary, but in 2004 it really isn't.  So if it's a horror novel you're looking for, I suggest looking elsewhere.  But if you're interested in a book that explores the desire/need for acceptance and companionship and what happens when it is denied, this is a pretty good choice.  Score: 7/10up the courage to meet them, they are of course terrified of him and drive him away.

B00000099Y|5.0|I first heard this not long after it's release and really couldn't get into it all as it seemed to be dischordant and unusually loud. I grew up as a teenager in the 70's and that era's hard rock seemed more structured and easier to listen to. <br /> <br />I visited Canada in 1997 and my cousin's son had a copy that he would play a lot. It grew on me and I ended up buying it. This is a album that shows that hard rock can have melody and interesting lyrics and playing. <br /> <br />This album is a real grower, and I still listen to it now. \\"Stinkfist\\" came second in the 1996 Hot 100 on Triple J in Australia and it is not the only excellent track. Nearly every track is worth listening to and this album, for me, is about the pinnacle of modern hard rock. This, I reckon, is Tool's best, but the \\"Undertow\\" and \\"Lateralus\\" albums are also pretty darn good as well.
0393035158|5.0|Thank you, Sam Harris, for stating what I've believed but couldn't say for years: people who believe in God are deluding themselves and others. It's time we stopped pretending any religion is \\"beautiful\\", especially one that is as backward, woman-hating, and hell-bent on destruction as the world has ever seen. Hope this book zooms to the top of the best seller list and gets people thinking. Political correctness be damned.
B00005JNEI|1.0|I've seen some great movies and I've seen some bad movies.  This is one of the worst I've ever seen.  I wonder if Amazon will sell FARENHYPE 911, a DVD also coming out October 5 that will expose all of the lies and half-truths in Mr. Moore's movie?
B0002OERI0|5.0|Yes, Green Day has lost some of its punk roots and slight elitism. But why is that to say that they couldn't have gotten perhaps better because of this? Billie Joe and the crew have matured a lot since their nimrod days, and have gained more musical ability because of this. Simply said, American Idiot is far superior musically than their previous albums. <br /> <br />Now don't get me wrong, I absolutely loved Green Day's previous works. In fact, Kerplunk is one of my favorite albums. By paying attention, one could plainly see that Green Day's music was gradually becoming more melodic and mature. They may have gone a bit too far with Warning, but aside of that. The gang has become more experienced and has in turn become a better group, which has enabled them to produce an album of this calibur. <br /> <br />What I'm trying to say is... buy this album. I don't care if it is your last fifteen dollars. Buy this album for your own sake.
B00006F7S4|5.0|Because it certainly has layers!  After listening to this album for two years, I can say without hesitation that it's a masterpiece.  It has revealed itself to me gradually over time, like much great art does.  When I first heard it, I thought many of the songs sounded the same (as others have mentioned in previous reviews).  Over time, each track has revealed its hooks and charms.  Beck's dad's string arrangements are absolutely essential (especially on \\"Round the Bend\\") and the use of electronics only enhances the tracks.  I haven't had any tragedies in my life to make me reach for this album, but if that time should come, the antidote is already in my CD player!
B0002S65W2|2.0|Gothika is the latest from Dark Castle Entertainment, specializing in horror movies with updated special effects, including House on Haunted Hill and Thir13en Ghosts, two of my favorites. So I wasn't expecting much, but I figured a movie like Gothika would be, well, gothic.  I was not disappointed.<br /><br />Miranda Grey (Halle Berry) is a monotone-voiced psychiatrist consulting with a patient (apparently, she only ever talks to one), Chloe Sava (Penelope Cruz), in a sanitarium. Chloe believes she is being raped by the devil in prison.  Miranda is the wife of Dr. Douglas Grey (Charles Dutton), a blubbery man that you can't believe is married to such a delicious package.  Doug is also the mental hospital's chief psychiatrist. When the two kiss, it's squeamishly unnerving-kudos to the director (Mathieu Kassovitz) for telegraphing the awful while filming something as mundane as a spousal embrace.<br /><br />Miranda works with another psychiatrist, Pete Graham (Robert Downey Jr.), a mumbly, ferret-like character who lusts for her from afar.  The three characters casually discuss psychological problems as if they were discussing the weather.  There's no warmth in any of the relationships, even though a storm rages in the background, crackling with thunder at appropriate moments.<br /><br />Then weird stuff happens. Miranda crashes her car in an effort to avoid running over a woman (Kathleen Mackey) she sees standing in the road.  The woman touches Miranda's face and the two burst into flames...<br /><br />Miranda wakes up in the same mental hospital she once worked at.  She's now a patient, accused of hacking her husband to death with an axe.  Pete is her psychiatrist.  And just like that, Miranda's world falls apart.<br /><br />The movie strains credibility with the absurd notion that Miranda would be placed in the very same mental facility that she worked at.  No effort is made to explain this particular plot point, so integral to the horror Miranda experiences.  Similarly, Miranda doesn't act particularly professional or even argue her case very well.  She collapses into a shrieking mess and pretty much stays that way throughout the film.<br /><br />Complicating matters is the ghost that haunts the facility.  In a refreshing horror movie turn, this is no Capser the Friendly Ghost.  She possesses people, she uses said possessed people to do awful things, and beats the crap out of anyone who doesn't do what she wants them to do.  In fact, she's so powerful and intrusive that you can't help but wonder why the ghost just doesn't do everything herself.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there are lots of problems with Gothika.  Halle Berry is too pretty for the role and lacks sufficient warmth to bring any real emotion to the screen but shrill hysteria.  Pete is so mush-mouthed, so wandering in his conversations, that he seems more like a patient than a doctor at the hospital.  But the real villain is the writer (Sebastian Gutierrez), who filled the plot with holes (security guards hand over their car keys to Miranda for WHAT reason exactly?), ridiculous punch lines (think Trinity from the Matrix's maxim \\"Dodge this\\" thrown into a movie that's supposed to be all about psychological horror), and awful dialogue.<br /><br />Gothika is one of those movies that is defined primarily by its lensing; everything is a bluish gray.  This is obviously intentional to set the mood of a dreary psychological horror. The relentless blue is punctuated by are occasional flashes of red-red lights, a red nametag, red outfits.  But unlike Sixth Sense, the red doesn't have any real symbolism behind it (except, perhaps, \\"DANGER!\\").  It's as if Kassovitz liked the idea of putting a blue lens over the film but didn't know what to do with the technique.<br /><br />And yet, Gothika has genuinely creepy moments that caused my various family members to jump out of their seats.  The horror, both of role reversal (the psychologist becomes the patient) and of the capacity of normal people to commit acts if horrible violence, is striking.  The insane asylum is its own character, a gaping series of hallways with wide-open spaces and cold glass walls.<br /><br />Gothika is no Sixth Sense or Stir of Echoes, and a little too slickly produced for its own good.  It's hampered by high-minded goals, burdened with a patchwork plot, and really, really blue.  But it's just scary enough, just freaky enough, and just interesting enough to make it worth watching.and of the capacity of normal people to commit acts if horrible violence, is striking.

B00008CQS0|4.0|My order arrived today and I'm just listening to the soundtrack for the first time... it's absolutely gorgeous - just like the film.<br />I was very excited to hear that there was a new Yann Tiersen disc out on the market - I have previously bought &quot;Tout est Calme&quot;, &quot;La Rupture&quot;, &quot;L'absente&quot;, &quot;C'etait ici&quot; (his double live disc - PHENOMENAL), and of course &quot;Le Fabuleux destin d'Amelie poulain&quot;.  What a master of music this guy is.  To boot I've also seen him perform in Marseilles and Montreal - Yann is worth whatever the ticket price is... great concerts!<br />To sum up - buy the disc!!! And like the OP said up above, make sure to get the one that's the right length, eh?  The one with 23 tracks.<br />A Yann Superfan,<BR>Ryan.
B00009V7T2|5.0|i had heard rumblings about the mars volta and at the drive-in but had never heard any of their albums. i read a lot of positive reviews so i decided to pick it up, only cost 10 bucks. wow. best 10 bucks i have ever spent! i admit it took a lot of spins for me to really start appreciating the music, but once you get it you're hooked. its the most mind-bending album ive ever heard. cedric is amazing. the mars volta is amazing. do yourself a favor and buy this cd! satisfaction guaranteed.
B000000W5N|5.0|All five stars:    1. Wild Horses - one of the Stones all time best.  2. Can't You Hear Me Knocking - listen to this one closely. It has a wonderful instrumental in the middle of it.  3. Dead Flowers - one of the Stones best songs.  4. Moonlight Mile - fantastic finisher.    The rest are four stars.
B0002K73EO|5.0|A satisfying album. The mood on every Cave album differs, however, this one follows in the steps of Nocturama where it is more upbeat, yet mellow and a bit restrained. The mellow songs are excellent, perfect tunes to relax or chill-out to on a beautiful day.  <br /> <br />Breathless has got to be my favorite, a very melodic, happy, acoustic tune...if only more of those were present (even though I believe this song has been lying around in some format or another for years, a [gloomy] version of it was performed with Kylie a few years back).  <br /> <br />Although the heavier tunes are solid (Get Ready For Love, There She Goes..), it sometimes seems as if the band is just banging away mindlessly on their instruments. The [heavier] melodies aren't as sweet as they used to be. Nevertheless, you cannot go wrong with purchasing this album. Mr. Cave has still got it (praise the Lord!).
B00005JY1B|4.0|One of the prior reviews stated that the ending was obvious in the first ten minutes; must have written the script.<br /><br />There are very few romantic drama/comedies where the two characters part in anything like this way, nor does the illness of the Theron character get revealed until the middle of the film. Certainly, the approach of the Theron character to her life is very unusual.<br /><br />Several of the reviewers noted that SF is beautifully photographed, almost perfectly photographed, to match the moods of the film. I agree.<br /><br />I've watched it about four times, and probably will watch it several more times. The film's mix just works!
B0002Y4TZG|5.0|After reading a few of the reviews here I must point out that what you are in essence buying is the Vanilla tapes. To any die hard Clash fan these are the lost demo tapes of London Calling and have taken on mythic proportions over the years. <br />If you are a casual fan and already have London Calling,perhaps you should leave alone. From my perspective, a new copy of the original album,a DVD and a copy of the Vanilla tapes represent huge VFM. Having said that someone listening to a bunch of demo songs could well be dissapointed, but they are what they are, demo's. <br />The interesting thing for me is that they show how the songs evolved into the album versions.  <br /> <br />Like I said probably for serious Clash fans and not Joe Public <br />
B00003CXCT|4.0|I think George Lucas has every right to tweak his films, but it has the effect of fans looking for what's been changed.  This leads to paying very close attention to the films and the remaining visual effect errors just pop out at me in Episode IV. I know in 1977 it was the best they could do, but today, it should be quite simple to fix the shots of TIE fighters with boxes around them. <br /> <br />The other scene that jumps out at me is Luke practicing with his light saber on the Falcon.  When he shuts it off while on-camera, it just doesn't flow right.  It never has, and after watching the documentary on the Light Sabers, I can see why it may be nearly impossible to ever fix this shot.   But I can see no excuse for the TIE fighters not being re-done.   <br /> <br />I don't know how it is that I can see these visual effects errors but Lucas hasn't noticed them.    <br /> <br />As for the changes made since the '97 Special Edition:   <br /> <br />Episode IV: Didn't really notice any.  I've heard the Solo-Greedo shootout was tweaked, but it's not that obvious to me. <br /> <br />In Episode V:   <br /> <br />1. Re-dubbing Bobba Fett's dialog using the actor who played Jango Fett in Episode II:  I liked this change.  It makes sense that since Bobba is an exact duplicate, he should grow up to sound just like Jango.   <br /> <br />2. Replacing the Emperor:  I like the idea of having the actor we've seen in Episodes I and II doing this bit, but the dialog just doesn't sound quite right.   Maybe I'll get used to the new lines, but the old way flowed much better.   The Emperor telling vader to \\"search your feelings\\" just doesn't sound right to me, I don't know why. <br /> <br />In Episode VI: <br /> <br />1. Having Hayden's image come up at the end is a very good change.   Since the character's apperance prior to donning the Darth Vader mask has been established now, where when the movies were made, we didn't know what he really looked like before he fell to the dark side.
B00003CXCT|5.0|At last, the greatest space saga of all time is finally on DVD. I was not alive to experience the phenomenon that the first entry in the series caused, nor do I know what it was like to experience the brand new feeling that Star Wars brought to moviegoers. What I do know is this: that these films are film Holy Grails which I believe to be some of the greatest films of all time. The first time I watched these movies was in the theatre, was at the re-releasing of Star Wars as new \\"Special Editions\\". It was in 1997, and I distinctly remember the sheer magic that the first Star Wars-\\"A New Hope\\", brought to me. I was instantly captivated. From there on I became a Star Wars fan, not the faux-lightsaber wielding, Star Wars cult fanatics, but a simple fan of a trilogy that changed a generation. Now here I am, reviewing the DVD version of a cultural phenomenon.  <br /> <br />Star Wars: Episode IV-A New Hope <br />Overall I was very pleased with this DVD. The picture and sound quality are beyond perfect, and most of the changes here are subtle. There is, however, another unwelcome change to the Han Solo/Greedo confrontation. Now, not only does Greedo shoot first, but Han now dodges Greedo's blast and then fires. I think that Lucas should change it back to the way it was. Come on Lucas, Han Solo was a space pirate. Space pirates, even if they are protagonists, still do whatever they can to survive in the galaxy. But otherwise this DVD is great. What I love about \\"A New Hope\\" is its open, space-opera cheerfulness. After all, this is the one that started it all, making more than $460 Million. Other changes include the lengthening of the detention block, the changing of English font to Auberesh font, and the alteration of the Jabba scene. <br /> <br />Star Wars: Episode V-The Empire Strikes Back <br />This is the most unaltered movie of this DVD set, and by far the best. This film is much darker than the first one, and much more dramatic. Part of the reason is that Irvin Kirshner is the director. He brought his cinematic vision to Lucas' already dazzling vision of the films. This perfect marriage of story and effects created \\"Empire\\". Another factor which made this film was so good was Mark Hamill's performance and his connection with Yoda, whose puppeteer was Frank Oz.  The most prominent change is the addition of Ian McDiarmid as the Emperor in his transmission. This is good for the sake of continuity, and Ian McDiarmid is much more sinister in this scene than the old woman being voiced by Clive Revill. The other change I could spot is the re-dubbing of Temuera Morrison's voice for Boba Fett. Again, this is the best of the series, and the best space movie ever made.  <br /> <br />Star Wars: Episode VI-The Return of the Jedi <br />Ah! Sigh. Jedi, jedi, jedi, jedi. Well, this is the least of the Star Wars films by far, and I really can't blame it all on Richard Marquand, the director. So I blame it on Lucas. It was the story which was flawed, not the directing. In fact, Marquand did not have much experience with special effects, and thus, if given a better script, would have done a much better job. And those dreaded Ewoks! I was in total disbelief when Wicket, the films central Ewok, was first introduced to Leia and the audience. The single bright light is the real introduction of Ian McDiarmid's Emperor, who provides an excellent villain to the movie. As for the changes, the most distinct and blasphemous one is Hayden Christensen supplanting Sebastian Shaw as the ghost of Anakin. Another alteration is the insertion of Naboo as one of the areas celebrating at the end.  <br />
B000002H33|1.0|You know you're a poser when you think Metallica sold out sometime AFTER Master of Puppets.    This is the Metallica sell-out album.  Unless Garbage Days came out before??    I forgot when I moved on to bands like Nuclear Death, A.C. Meat S**ts, Nasty Savage, etc.    A lot of bands have self-destructed selling out but Metallica is a true sellout success story.  I can't blame them.  They are wealthy beyond belief now.    I am not going to waste my money listening to this pop garbage though.
B0000062FJ|5.0|Thirty-five years later, this is still one of my favorite albums.  It was revolutionary when it was released.  Rock-n-Roll still lived, and Rock was just being born.  Critics had no idea what to make of it.  Like much of the music comming out of San Francisco at the time (e.g., the Greatful Dead and Big Brother and the Holding Company), much of the album has the live feel and sound of some very talented musicians jamming. <br /> <br />The music is an absolutely fabulous fusion of latin/caribbean rythms, blues and rock -- and no one can get into the meaning of a note the way Carlos Santana can.  Santana's music is very dense, with tons of percussion and Santana's incredible guitar work. The bass anchors and gives the music a sensual, pulsating, passionate, primal feel. <br /> <br />With this re-release, they add three live songs from Woodstock, two of which were previously unreleased.  This is a good thing -- the original album was shy of 40 minutes - the more the better.
B00028HBKM|1.0|For all those who think that this film \\"really really\\" shows the suffering this Jesus guy went through -- all I can say is they must not be reading their own Bible very carefully.<br /><br />Gibson's film is based on a particularly bloody variant of the \\"Passion\\" story that was last in major vogue during the Crusades --  and is nowadays espoused by the same group of religious kooks who opposed Vatican II, as well as objecting to the Catholic Church's apology for the Inquisition.<br /><br />Essentially, this film is entirely about the craven worship of violence.  It sucks your soul dry and fills you with despair.  It says that we humans are worthless, despicable creatures who delight more in the suffering of one historical figure -- than in paying attention to this man's message.<br /><br />In other words, it's entirely about Jesus torture and nothing at all about his best message:  Love each other.<br /><br />A real shame, this is.  The even bigger shame, I think, were all the parents I saw exposing their children to this pure, distilled nightmare fuel.
B00003CXCT|1.0|Future generations will now be unable to see the original versions. The changes made for these versions are NOT for the better.  Fx.: In the famous scene in the bar Greedo get's the first shot against Han Solo (and misses at a distance of one yard!!) so that Han Solo political correctly doesn't shoot before being shot at himself! George Lucas must have lost his marbels changing a great scene like that!
B00002E224|1.0|Having heard of this movie for a long time, I have waited to see it after my trip to Vienna. I was so happy I did. The movie was extremely boring and pretentious about two self-absorbed people. The simple rule for a romantic movie to work is that the characters have to be likable and hopefully they have great chemistry. This movie lacks both. I watched the entire boring thing because of Vienna. But even Vienna cannot save this dreadful film. For a great romantic movie in a beautiful European city, why not try David Lean's \\"Summertime\\".  Yes, it is about a chance encounter between two strangers. Yes, it has a lot of talking. Yes, the last scene is also in a train station. But boy, what a difference!
B0002OERI0|5.0|I give this cd my HIGHEST recommendation.  Its definitely a mixed bag for Green Day, but I think there is something here for everyone..old and new. It really exceeded my expectations.  Well worth the wait. Enjoyable from begininng to end.  Definitely add this one to your collection...you won't be disappointed.
B00005JMUA|1.0|What a piece of crap. And that goes for both volumes. Had it not been for the wonderful music clip on vol2, the whole thing would've just plain pissed me off. Stop wasting the world's time with mindless crap, Tarantino. Go get a real job.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Billie Joe has always impressed me, but I was seriously wondering if he could churn out another gem. American Idiot indicates not only the fact that Billy Joe's energy is still fierce, but that he has continued to grow as a songwriter unafraid to take risks and try new things. The album is textured, and rocks hard! Its melodically and rhythmically rich, and works so well as an entire album. Possibly the most impressive work by Green Day ever. The production value will make you happy with your stereo! Get it.
B000008LOV|5.0|I absolutly love this CD and all Traveling Wilburys albumbs but they all fail to capture te feel of the first one.I have always been facinated by the wilburys they where around for so little time and made such great songs.My favorites are End of the line and not alone anymore.I respect all the guys in here but Roy Orbison is the best of the bunch.I am confused why someone said Dylan was missing from end of the line he's there singing backup and on a sad note for anyone lucky enoguh to see the video for end of the line you will notice one major thing missing.Roy Orbison passed away before the video was filmed.and although he did write the song and sang in it his time was up I guess.The video was kind of a tribue to him.You will notice his guitar sitting in a rocking chair and a photo of him on the wall.Anyway for anyone interested in this kind of classic rockabilly/country/blues/pop/ whatever just buy it its the best thing to come out of th 80's Truly
B000268QB2|5.0|If you're even doubting about getting out and getting this album, DON'T. This is one of the greatest album I've even bought. The music and lyrics go perfectly in sync with each other. The band does a perfect job staying true to their songs. In a world filled with tampered pop music, this is so untouched, raw. It's exquisite. Go out and get it, you will defnitely not regret it.
0440237688|4.0|I loved The Giver. I thought it was one of the most insightful and thought-provoking books that I have ever read. What intrigued me the most was the society that Lois Lowry created in this book; a society where everyone and everything is the same. It seems like it would be completely impossible, but is it? Could our government, in the hopes of making life easier for us, slowly turn our society into this one? I don't know the answer, but it's something to think about. <br /> I also liked the way she explained the importance of memories. It's true that memories can often be painful, as both the Giver and Jonas experience, but they can also bring joy. In the Elders attempt at making life painless, they also took away that joy. No one in this society really lives, they just go through the motions of life contently, but they aren't really happy. It is memories and the ability to choose that make life worth living. <br />
B00003CXCT|4.0|I am a huge star wars geek (but I do have hygene skills and relationships mr stereotype). My parents brought me to see star wars in the theater when I was 3 years old. It was the first thing I remembered in my life.<br /><br />I must admit I was apprehensive when I heard the even more things had been changed in this release and that the original theatrical release (or even the 1995 thx remaster) was not included. However, the changes added here were not as bad as I feared. The extra dialogue in the emperor hologram scene will take some getting used to. All in all, these changes did enhance the movie rather than feel like the intrusions of SOME of the 1997 SE additions. I say SOME, because not everything added in the SE versions was bad.<br /><br />Bad SE stuff:<br /><br />-Greedo shooting first. The scene looks horrible. Anyone can tell that it was spliced. Had they been able to make it more fluid and natural looking I would not complain. It looks like the videocamera \\"magic\\" tricks that I did on my own vhs camera as a kid where I would stand in front of the camera wave my hands, pause the camera and then put my little sister next to me, unpause and say she magically appeared.<br /><br />-The extra Vader dialoque in ESB just sounded not like his voice anymore.<br /><br />-The awful musical scene in Jabba's palace in ROTJ.<br /><br />Most people tend not to mention the many good \\"additions\\" made in the SE films:<br /><br />-Cloud City looks much better with the subtraction of some walls and digital buildings added in. Much more lively.<br /><br />-All of the matte fixes (see through cockpits in ESB hoth battle).<br /><br />-The Biggs scene finally explained what Luke said in ANH. All my life I was trying to figure out what he said after he put down his toy ship and said \\"Biggs is right I'm never gonna get off this rock\\". It never made sense before.<br /><br />All in all this is a good release. Everyone else badmouthing the color changing and sounds being wrong... check your tvs and dvd players you have a technical problem, NOT this dvd release. Others complaining of boxes around the TIEs in space... yes these were there in the original VHS release of the theatrical versions. They are due to the matte filming process. Lucas must not have been able to fix these like some of the other matte corrections, otherwise he would have.<br /><br />I give 4 stars because I still believe that the originals could have been included as a bonus even if they were not \\"fixed up\\". Lucas talks about the millions that would have cost... come on buddy, you've made billions off people like me already. It won't hurt to dig into that pocket... They could have transferred the 1995 thx release to DVD and I would've been happy to at least have a copy of the originals that would not degrade like the 5 copies of the trilogy that I wore out as a kid. I have kept my thx remaster with only 2 or 3 viewings and I plan to burn it to dvd myself since Lucas has shunned us.sounds being wrong... check your tvs and dvd players you have a technical problem, NOT this dvd release.

B0002MPU1K|5.0|Great CD. I'm 23 years old, and I just recently heard about Peter. He has really made an awesome CD which I highly recommend. Great singing, piano playing, great grooves, great arrangements, and great production. Check it out.
B000089CJI|5.0|Postal Service is everything you want or need it to be.  It can energize or calm.  It can keep you awake or help you fall asleep.  It can keep you motivated or remind you to step back for a minute.   <br />The music has the wonderful ability to fade into the background or lay prominant in the listener's mind and still be good either way.    Few musicians create true ALBUMS anymore, most \\"albums\\" are just a bunch of songs.  Postal Service has created an ALBUM.  To listen to just one or two tracks does the work injustice. <br />With interesting, unusual instumentals and enchanting vocals, as well as lyrics with MEANING, \\"Give Up\\" is a work that many other contemporary artists should aspire to.
B0002L592Q|5.0|I was disgusted to see this idiot's review for this movie-giving it one star truly shows your cold heart. This from someone who has a wishlist full of \\"Angel\\" and \\"buffy the vampire slayer\\" DVDs. Oh yeah-you're such an example to rate this great movie as unbelievable, your believing in vampires and all. Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things-THERE'S NO HOPE FOR YOU!!!!!
B0002OERI0|3.0|everyone who sees this album as such a great break through for this band, does not listen to enough music. if this is the gab that will bridge your musical tastes, then thats a good thing, but thats all this album can be. its just not that great, the lyrics are pretty good, but its also just Green Day. they are the reason i play music. the first song i learned was Good Riddance. ive listened to so much music since then, that they are only just a platform for memories for me. they are still catchy as hell though. if you're a long time fan and have a lot of respect for this band, get the album, but dont expect a masterpeice. its not the best music ever written, but for Green Day, its pretty damn good, its just not the sound they're best at. i am going to listen to this more and maybe my opinion will change, but ive liked every other green day record from the first or second listen. this just isnt cutting it so far.
B000021YQV|3.0|I was greatly impressed and surprised by System of a Down's first album. It was something different (VERY different) and was extremely entertaining. With this album, however, I was somewhat disappointed. While there are many good things about it (which you can read about in the great number of other reviews), I found it to be purposely more catchy, not to mention repetitive (especially in the lyrics department). So while it is an enjoyable album, I do not find it to be the masterpiece that others claim it to be. But if you like what you've heard from System in the form of singles, you'll likely like this album and it may very well be worth checking out.
B00006GFAB|1.0|C'mon and KISS MY ASS!!! (If there's no other way to finally open your eyes) Money, money, money - this isn't for the fans! How naive do people get?
006109594X|3.0|While I enjoyed the story, the author gets really long-winded at times, and sometimes talks for pages and pages about things that really have nothing to do with the story. <br /> <br />I enjoyed this storyline enough that I have started \\"Kilo Class\\", the second story in the series.  I'm only 50 pages in, and it's great so far.  There hasn't been the same droning on and on about things that don't concern the story(yet).  <br /> <br />This book is worth reading, but just skip ahead 10 pages when the author starts to wander. <br /> <br />
B0002S94OS|5.0|For any of us out there that were searching for the Real Heavy Metal band of the future, then we found them in Lamb of God.  Forget what is called nu-metal, that is not metal at all. Lamb of God is metal and this album is one of the best Metal albums to come out in the 21st century.  You're not going to find bands like Slayer anymore, but I think this album brings us as close as we're going to get to anything like that.  Can't wait to see them on tour with Fear Factory.
B0002OERI0|4.0|Intrigued as I was after listening to the first track off this CD, I was absolutely sold when I heard random tracks aired on a local station. I could hardly believe this was the Green Day we have come to know over the years. The last few albums were anything but mediocre, and this move was very welcome in the middle of that boredom. Although the \\"rockopera\\" concept is no longer original (many bands, from Beatles to Muse have tried it), it is a challenge Billy Joe and co. pulled off with great success. Everything has gotten richer: lyrics, ideas, music. \\"Jesus of suburbia\\" sounds so tight as any two-minute punk anthem, and the four individual parts could be singled out as standout tracks. \\"We are the waiting\\", on the other hand, falls into the stereotype of the bland stadium hymn, and it does not really contribute to anything but the continuity of the story. But the pace is quickly recovered with \\"St. Jimmy\\" and what I consider the best song of the record, \\"Wake me up when september ends\\". It almost seems like the new direction taken in \\"American idiot\\" will not last, and gladly we accept the facts. Even when Green Day have proved they can make a record beyond the usual silly, fun, get-on-your-feet-and-mosh stuff, we are still waiting for that great collection of songs that will finally give them the place they deserve in punk history. In the meantime, enjoy what's served and expand the horizons past the spiked hair.
B00005B36H|5.0|Normally, I would run a song order for each and every track on the record, but this time, considering that half the tracks are sounds and noises rather than music, I will instead write about everything longer than a few minutes, or, anything involving musical stylings.  These tracks include the following: <br /> <br />The Grudge <br />This song has astonishing melodic tempos hidden in each other.  If you try singing the vocal part when the vocal part isn't going, you will be lost.  But when the actual vocals come in, it is so natural.  The drumming in this song creates more focus, away from the slight repetitiveness in the guitar and bass parts (this is the case in a few Tool songs i.e. Forty Six and Two).  The scream in this song is face-melting.   <br />9/10 <br /> <br />Eon Blue Apocalypse <br />A simple guitar solo.  One and one half minutes long; goes by fast; builds into the Patient very well. <br />5/10 <br /> <br />The Patient <br />A couple of my friends swear on this song.  I'm fond of it, but it sounds different in a slightly bad way.  The chorus is kind of original in a crazy sense and it seems like the band tried too hard to create an odd tempo.  The singing is too high, creating bad (and sometimes good) sounds.  The guitar part is less tedious than others but still lacks something.   <br />8/10 <br /> <br />Schism <br />Believe it or not, this song is about marriage.  A Schism is a seperation, and Cripli Communicadio is latin for \\"crippled communication\\" which enstates a poor marital union.  I don't know if Maynard was ever married, but I know that he is a single parent.  This song may have something to do with his union with his ex-partner.  The first half of the song )excluding the bass solo) is somewhat drawling, but the second half is amazing.  The song seems a bit too short though. <br />8/10 <br /> <br />Parabol <br />Wonderful build-up.  If you just listened to this song and not Parabola, the next track, you would wonder what kind of drug the band was doing then.  But the creation of transition between the two is incredible. <br />6/10 <br /> <br />Parabola <br />This is the best drumbeat in the song.  It has a fast tempo and a greatly harmonically overtoned guitar progression that leads to weird bass parts.  It is so fast and so cool.  It will honestly just make your heart explode.   <br />9/10 <br /> <br />Ticks and Leeches <br />There's a funny story behing this song.  Tool's record company, Volcano, asked them to put a heavier song on this CD.  The outcome was Ticks and Leeches with lyrics like, \\"you little blood-sucking tick and parasite,\\" or \\"is this what you wanted?  Is this what you had in mind?  Is this what you wanted?  Cause this is what you're getting.\\"  Talk about a paradigm for hatred.  The song is sort of nu-metal like, except it's in 7/8 time and it's about eight and a half minutes long.  It's still a pretty musically inclined tune. <br />8/10 <br /> <br />Lateralus <br />My favorite song on the CD.  Once again, the first half of the song lacks a little bit, but creates a great build up for the rest.  It's like a spaceship taking off, only it has bass, guitar, and drums.  The vocals are strangely scratchy, but allow for a much better atmosphere than any cleanly sang song.   <br />10/10 <br /> <br />Disposition <br />This is very soft and very short.  The lyrics change once, the guitar never does, neither to the drums (which aren't really drums, but more hand toms).  Not one of my favorites. <br />7/10 <br /> <br />Reflection <br />Just a big build up to nothing really.  Tool could've used these extra few minutes to make some songs better (Schism; Parabola).  The vocals are once again too high. <br />7/10 <br /> <br />Triad <br />This is a crazy weird/good song that makes you want to immediately shoot people.  The guitar sounds created before the drumset comes in are amazing.  The drum part, when it comes in, is absolutely excellent.  I don't fully understand the two minutes silence at the end, but who does anyway.   <br />9/10 <br /> <br />So this is a must have.  Don't buy it if you're new to Tool.  Buy Aenima or Undertow or something.
B00005MP58|5.0|I have to say right off the bat that I am prejudiced towards this DVD and thank the BBC/A&E home videos for bringing out such an amazing adaptation of the classic Pride and Prejudice. If you havent already watched the DVD then do so RIGHT NOW, especially if you are into historical stuff! I did not read the book before watching this mini-movie(I had read an abridged version in school many,many years back) and I feel that not reading the book does not in any way make the movie less understandable and enjoyable. I would in fact recommend that one watch the movie first and then read the book. That is what I did! The person who said that it is impossible to not watch all 6 hours in one go is correct. You have to sit down and watch the whole series so get set with some good food and drinks as well as a nice comfy blanket. Personally the second part/DVD is my favourite because that is when things really begin to change for Lizzy and Jane and how all the pieces begin to fit together. You are missing out on something if you havent watched this DVD.
B000002WNP|5.0|This 5 CD Box Set together with the Boxes \\"The Complete 50's Masters\\", \\"The Essential 70's Masters\\" and the sountracks recordings are the best comprehensive treat of Elvis' extremely rich back catalog that the label ever did. Before them (and also after them) there were uncountable collections of greatest hits, best of's, ballads collections, love songs, etc, as well as the re-issues of some of his albums, containing many overlapped material while some great songs were always absent. <br />The sountracks recordings are not included in this set, at this point I agree with critics that nearly all those recordings are the most poor songs that Elvis did. I don't agree with them when they say that the best of Elvis were his 50's recordings, because in the 60's he sounded more sedate and calm.  Maybe his 50's songs were the most influential in  the 20th century music, but I also like very much the ballads, he recorded many beautiful ballads during the 60's and 70's, some of them became classics as well as his earlier rockabilly songs; besides the rock'n'roll was always present in all the decades. <br />
0739309013|5.0|Last week I finished listening to John Grisham's The Last Juror during my daily commute. I was very impressed. The first notable thing about this story is that while there is some courtroom time, it is NOT about a court case or a lawyer, etc, like many of Grisham's books. Grisham is a fine writer, but in this story about a small southern town and it's very young, very green newspaper editor/writer, he outdid himself. I'll warn that it doesn't have quite as much \\"excitement\\" and \\"suspense\\" as you occasionally find in his courtroom thrillers. It's more laidback than those, although there is some suspense and a touch of blood and gore. This story is about people. It's about a town that changes over time and the townsfolk who change with it - some with relish and some kicking and screaming. It's about Willie Trainer, the newspaper owner who comes to town, an outsider, buys the newspaper, and over time gains the respect, loyalty and love of the town he serves. The true beauty of this book, though, is the incredible way that Mr. Grisham introduces you to the characters and the townspeople. Each character in this book is a story finely woven. You're not reading/hearing that Joe Blow eats eggs for breakfast and is wearing black pants and a blue shirt. You learn about these people: their past, their present, and you look forward to their future. The writing is masterful in the creation of characters that we care about, are interested in and who shape this story. When I finished the story, I actually left the radio off for the rest of my ride home just so I could think about what a wonderful story it was and how much I enjoyed it.<br /><br />Following Grisham's other non-courtroom drama's, specifically A Painted House, I see his talent is truly in character development. But, while A Painted House was good, it wasn't like this story. This had a much more satisfying plot, filled with wonderful characters, and an end that was somewhat expected, but that provided an end to a tale and to an era. I recommend this story. The narration was wonderful. Don't go into it expecting the same old Grisham, though. Go into it expecting a good story about people who touch you.<br /><br />This review is in reference to the unabridged audio version and the narration was excellent on this version.  This is definitely a book for the commute.le and to an era. I recommend this story. The narration was wonderful. Don't go into it expecting the same old Grisham, though. Go into it expecting a good story about people who touch you.  <br /> <br />This review is in reference to the unabridged audio version and the narration was excellent on this version.  This is definitely a book for the commute.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I think the appearence of the DVD version is very Good. The CGI has added a enhanced atmosphere and has added greatly to the visuals of this trilogy. What I can't understand nor want to, is the fact that Lucas has changed parts of these movies for the WORSE ! There are at least five or six addtions/changes made from the original versions that make this trilogy embarrissing to watch. The one change I really do not understand is the end of ROTJ. Why did Lucas remove the fun and triumphant Ewok victory song for the lame and cold feeling classical peice. To me the end of the series is ruined by that change. When I have children that are old enough to watch these movies I am going to have to dig out the old VHS versions for them to watch. This trilogy IS NOT the Star Wars movies you know and love. This trilogy is a edited version of the orginal story and it is painfull to watch. Avoid this collection at all costs.....
B00005JMXX|1.0|Well, the first half of the movie was quite well done, I thought. It managed to be exciting, had a bit of interesting fluid physics in there, and was building up to be a good \\"environmental\\" sci-fi movie. <br /> <br />And then the second half of the movie happened. <br /> <br />Suddenly the script shifted gears. We had leftist political statements pounding us in the face before we could move! Americans crossing the Mexican border was a good example. I guess I might add, I'm not American (I'm Australian. Apparently our country did well in the climate shift) but I felt that the scriptwriter was only interested in engaging in political point scoring. More power to him, I suppose, but this bugged me. It wasn't entertaining. And say what you will about politics and movies, but I just don't care. When I want to do some political thinking, I'll read a book and/or look at news sources. I don't go to the movies to become an informed voter.
068987474X|5.0|I saw Greg Behrendt on Oprah talking about his book and was so intrigued I bought it right away.  Oprah was right,ladies it could save you 20 years of therapy.  It's nothing you don't  know already but it drives it all home.  Avoid and/or end all those dead end relationships with the tips Greg gives.  Learn to be in the driver's seat when it comes to your own happiness with love and relationships.  It's a great book and it'll make you laugh too.
B00005JL9B|5.0|Like some of the other reviewers here, I had read the more-easily-obtained book before seeing the movie - enjoying it very much - and went in knowing the premise. To begin with, Battle Royale, in all its forms, is an exceptional work of creative fiction, and I think that of its three forms (movie, book and manga), the movie may well be the best. <br /> <br />In praise of Battle Royale in general, it is first of all a very engaging and moving story, with a simple yet carefully thought-out premise, an intricate plot and compelling human dynamics. I knew that much when I read the book. But the movie has increased the entire product in my estimation, and deserves a good deal of praise seperate from and above the book. <br /> <br />For one thing, I think the film is more moving. It really brings home how horrible and tragic the premise is; which is sometimes lost in the pulpy exuberance with which the plot of the book unfolds. The actors convey the situation of utterly doomed children so perfectly, conveying all the shadings of paranoia, hatred and outright psychosis; it really must have been a feat to find so many young, good actors. The film's biggest surprise, though, is the change that was made to the 'villain,' played here by the legendary Beat Takeshi. What was a stock evil character in the novel becomes a richer, more striking, although perhaps not entirely consistent personality in the film, giving it an emotional dimension even beyond the game itself. <br /> <br />I think the movie handles the violence about right. It doesn't cut away from the gore, but there's no excessive spurting of blood. The fight scenes aren't immaculately choreographed, but that may be for the best, considering what the film is really about.  <br /> <br />There are two other touches in the film which I think are absolutley brilliant - which won't mean anything to people who haven't seen it, but to those who have, and are in the habit of reading reviews of products they've already bought in order to contrast their own opinions - weren't the instructional video and the 'radio exercises' pure genius? <br /> <br />There are a couple of totally minor points on which I thought the movie stumbled. For one thing, although of course they had to cut out a lot of substance to fit the running time, they cut out some of the best characters and interactions, such as Sho Tsukioka and Mitsuko's elaborately treacherous dispatching of the pair of boys.  I also thought Kazuo was a more interesting character in the book - by far _the_ most interesting character in the book - but it might have been neccesary to simplify him in this way for the film, so that it could focus on more important dynamics. <br /> <br />I now actually think that BR, more than an enjoyable, higher-than-average quality pop culture artifact, may be an important and defining statement in this day and age. It shows us, for one thing, that stories still have the power to shock and arouse sympathy, even from BR's most likely audience, the very jaded youth who feature in the story. Also, I think it accurately reflects, in a very abstracted and metaphorical way, the plight of a young generation in an uncertain and perilous world. I could be reaching with this, but I will at least say that BR is an amazing overall _product_ which should be examined by anyone with any interest in the humanities.
B00003CXCT|3.0|I am writing about what appear to be defects in Episode IV: A New Hope.  The defects are video and audio glitches in chapter 26 and 27.  This is the scene where Governor Tarkin is about to blow up Alderaan.  It continues after the planet is destroyed when Obi Wan feels the disturbance in the force.  The video seems to pause and skip about 4 times over about 10 minutes during the two chapters above.  I returned my first copy, got a second one and the exact same glitches appeared at the exact same spots as the first one I returned.  I was wondering if anybody else noticed this, if it's a widespread defect.  I tried playing the disc on my other DVD player and the same defects were present.  Also, the audio is not very good.  Some of the dialouge is almost impossible to hear and if you raise the volume, the music is too loud.  I haven't played the other movies yet. <br /> <br />Overall, it looks like the collection is great, but until I see the other movies, I can't say for sure.  I was going to return my second copy, but I am starting to think that the defects are widespread.  Anybody have any info on these defects?
B0000AQS0F|5.0|While overlooked by many when aired, everyone I know who has seen it falls in love with it. A refreshing departure from blueprint TV. Lots of action, a great cast and character interaction and development not seen in a long time. There's a real story here, as well. Nothing like the usual Stuff. Borrow it. Watch it. Buy it.
B00003CXCT|2.0|I've been a huge star wars fan for like ever. So without a doubt, I threw down the 40-50 dollars required to pre-order these movies. It was like a no-brainer for me.. <br /> <br />Boy, Did I get burned (kinda). Ya see, you purchase these movies, you're getting three DVD's of movies that have been messed with. This may seem horrible but its George Lucas's choice. You don't tell the storyteller how to tell a story. Enjoy the movies for what they are. (And that seems to be it) <br /> <br />In addition to these three, you get bonus special materials DVD. <br /> <br />And thats where it ends. Thats all you get. Don't be fooled into thinking there is anything beyond that. Movies like LOTR may have spoiled us to what we can expect from a DVD \\"collection\\", but thank you 20th Century Fox, for reminding me how cheaply you can make a DVD. Did I mention your DVD's may not even work? Oh yeah.. about that.. Apparently, Episode 4 and Episode 5 seem to be returned way too much. (Don't believe me? Ask your local video store clerk, he'll probably know about it) <br /> <br />So to end it all, If you love these movies.. unfortunately, you have no choice but to buy these DVD's. But don't expect anything to be proud of, especially the disc's themselves.. I could have printed out better stickers then these jokers used. And don't use Amazon.. go to the store.. buy the trilogy, save the receipt.. and make sure your DVD's don't skip.
B0002CX4RM|3.0|The star of this production is Jimmy Levine and his outstanding Metropolitan Orchestra.  He turns this oratorio into a sizzling opera.  Too bad the singers acting doesn't ignite as well. Domingo and Borodina are in excellent voice, but seem totally uninvolved in their characters.  Borodina especially is not the temptress and sex goddess that Dalila ia supposed to be.  She stands and sings note perfect, but there is no interaction between her and Domingo - sparks don't fly even though the lighting director seemed to be in love with the color red. And where does this thing take place, a volcano? There are the mandatory bumps and grinds in the \\"bring down the temple\\" sequence, but the real action is all in the orchestra.  I'm not sorry I bought this DVD, but when I want a more total production, I'll go back to the San Francisco version.
B000009MF7|5.0|I have adored the 2 Ravel Piano Concerti since high school and I have heard every existing recording of these masterpieces.  Nothing compares to the interepretations of Zimmerman, especially in the Left Hand Concerto.  The opening solo cadenza is truly breathtaking and accomplishes what Ravel intended--that the absence of the right hand would not diminish in the least, the virtuosity of the piano part.  Zimmerman has an uncanny ability to bring rhythmic flexibility and freshness in every measure and the concluding cadenza has never been played with such power and moving commitment to Ravel's score.  I adore Alicia de Larrocha's recording but Zimmerman easily takes the first prize.  Pierre Boulez' conducting is always impassioned and thrilling.  A must for any lover or Ravel and the piano.
B00003CXCT|3.0|I knew that this version would be the dreaded &quot;Special Edition&quot; Star Wars Trilogy, but I figured that I could tolerate the added scenes and such, so I bought this DVD set. After watching them, I feel so violated! It wasn't the original release, it wasn't even the special edition, IT IS A COMPLETELY BUTCHERED VERSION OF THE STAR WARS TRILOGY! The special edition was bad enough, but now on this DVD release, they have edited and changed even MORE scenes!<BR>The straw that broke the camel's back for me was at the end of the Return of the Jedi movie, where Luke looks off and sees the ghosts of Obi-Wan, Yoda, and his father. THEY REPLACED HIS FATHER WITH THE ACTOR THAT PLAYED ANAKIN IN EPISODE II. So now Luke looks off and sees two OLD Jedi's, and one young teeny-bopper! LUKE LOOKED OLDER THAN HIS DAD! Seeing that felt so wrong! All the new scenes felt wrong, and out of place! They all stick out like a sore thumb! I didn't even wait for the credits. I had to take the disk out! That was just too much for me.<br />Yes, this was George Lucas's creation, and he can do what ever he wants to it but this is just wrong. Star Wars was a classic! I am sure that I am not the only person who liked it the way it was.<BR>Re-storing and Re-mastering a movie is one thing, but adding and changing scenes to this degree is a crime. I really think that Mr. Lucas is going through some sort of mid-life crisis. He must have woke up one morning thinking that anything old is bad!<BR>A lot of people compare this DVD set to Michael Jackson's face, and I have to agree. We should be able to see and buy the versions of Star Wars we want. He should have released both versions, &quot;original&quot; and &quot;special&quot; editions. If he wants to change stuff, change episode 1,2, and 3. They're not classics, there not even well liked by fans.<br />The comercial advertised this DVD set like it was going to be the Star Wars that we all remembered. It's still Star Wars, but it's not the version that a lot of people wanted to preserve on DVD. I bought it and I am not happy with it. I am out a few dollars, but at least I can hope that my review will save a few people from having to see there favorite movie and childhood memories butchered like this. Buy at your own risk!
B000000WJZ|5.0|I first heard this CD by borrowing it from a friend 3 years ago. I never really gave it a chance until I was bored one day and realized I had to give it back to him sooner or later. I had already seen numerous, random clips of the live compilation \\"Vieuphoria\\". Once I sat down and actually listened to it, I truly realized it's beauty. This album, in my opinion, is the most emotional and truly powerful and innovating of any of the other Smashing Pumpkins albums. Period. Like many others, I too heard the emotional beauty of \\"Mayonaise\\" and the driving anger of \\"Soma\\" and I realized that at that fragile point in my life, I had a turnaround or a break-through, and decided that Smashing Pumpkins are my favorite band. They have been ever since, thanks to this album.
B0000584V3|5.0|Let me start off by saying that anyone who likes Good Charlotte shouldn't be reviewing cd's that they are pre-disposed to hating. This music is far to complex and intelligent for any GC fan to even come close to understanding. If you like Opeth, then you'll like this. If you're new to Opeth, then pick this one up or start out with Still Life or My Arms Your Hearse and you will not be disappointed. If you like GC or anything the Evil Empire (a.k.a. MTV) brings to the public you will not like Opeth, but if you like melodies and intricacies with your metal, you better prep your cd player for hell.
B00003CX5P|3.0|When I first saw Star Wars Episode I- The Phantom Menace at the 12:01 AM showing on opening day, all the familiar elements were intact.The 20th Century Fox logo,the tag line \\"A Long Time Ago...\\", then the title Star Wars with John Williams classic score playing behind it, then the familiar scroll this time detailing the beginning of the movie.Then we begin to see that this is an entirely new Star Wars.   Coming sixteen years after Return of the Jedi,TPM looks and feels different from the first trilogy.The special effects are amazing as a majority of the movie is filmed against CGI.Unfortunately the CGI curses the movie as the storytelling factor is diluted.   This is George Lucas's first directing job since the first SW movie 22 years ago.Being a bit rusty, as well gearing the movie towards kids(which plagued ROTJ)left a bad taste in most fans mouth.Most barbs are pointed at the character of Jar Jar Binks(Ahmad Best), an annoying yet endearing Gungan who's main funtion was comic relief,but comes off as obnoxious.The other is the weak script that talks down to fans, and dialogue which talented actors (Liam Neeson,Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman,Samual L. Jackson) has to struggle with.Jake Lloyd, who plays Anakin Skywalker suffers the most in a role that may ruin any chance of a further acting career.   The saving grace of the movie is the villianous Darth Maul who wields a double edge lightsaber in a fabulous lightsaber fight that blows away the previous films climactic battles, as well as the podrace on Tatooine.Unfortunatly the validity of a young Anakin saving the day stretches credibility very thin.   As far as older fans are concerned,this is an entirly different SW from the previously trilogy.Despite the state of the art effects and exciting scenes, TPM stands as the weakest SW movie as Lucas loses sight of what made the previous trilogy so loved by the fans.Beloved characters and strong storytelling.
0553208845|5.0|A great book that had me completely subjective to the storyline, into the journey of Siddhartha and the many other characters: his childhood friend - Govinda, his father, his later lover - Kamala, his son, his acquaintance with the Buddha, his friend and teacher - Vasudeva the ferryman and others.<br /><br />It's a very interesting story of a spiritual seeker who at the very end of the novel manifests his enlightenment, as his childhood friend, Govinda, experiences. The journey of spiritual seeking, of learning and taking in knowledge, of asceticism, of sexuality and love, of power seeking and money making, of both poor homelessness and luxuriant living and its eventual culmination, the outcome of the spiritual enlightenment: the subjective experience beyond all knowledge and teachings, transcending all the relative and transitory existence into a unity of Being.<br /><br />Now it's the way Hesse writes and his descriptive and artistic style that weigh his story of the enlightened soul and I found it outstanding. Similar to his other book, Journey to the East, the story leads up to the final outcome, the ending of the novel, the last chapter, explains what can not be explained culminating from the entire story line.<br /><br />The story itself depends on the readers individual experiential spiritual seeking and both external and internal search. The external eventually leads to the internal where all lies in mystical experience and the internal and personal spiritual development.<br /><br />I can't help but continue visualizing the last scene of the book with the sudden flash of Siddhartha's translucent smiling face overseeing the realm of multifaceted relativity in its complete unity under the mystical kiss of Govinda on Siddhartha's farhead and his perceived subjectivity of consciousness and marvel at Hesse's attempted descriptive undertaking of the Nirvana and subjective experience. What an awesome attempt to convey such a non-thing and Hesse is a great and unique writer.
6302862949|4.0|I saw this movie again (after 16 years) with my Russian girl friend. Amazing that only a very few actually could speak Russian. Several so called Russians in this movie had such a bad foreign accent that she could hardly understand anything what they were saying... I guess back in those days in the cold war (1985) it was hard finding really good Russian actors. <br /> <br />In any case, I have always liked the tension in this movie, the struggle to be free and the dancing as a way to demonstrate all the forbidden thoughts and feelings. Baryshnikov and Hines were great dancing partners. Actually, just the dancing alone is worth watching this movie. <br /> <br />As a curiosity, I can add that the end scene (will not go into details here) seems to have been more or less copied in the latest James Bond movie.

B000089RV6|5.0|My first taste of AC/DC was a cassette (High Voltage) I lifted from a friend's mother when I was 15.  Tracks like The Jack, TNT, and of course High Voltage are classic early AC/DC.  Bon's voice was unique with a range that peaked with a great rock n' roll scream.  But he didn't make it to the studio for Back in Black.  I recommend the band's early catalog, every album has music worthy of any true rock fan.  But with the release of Back in Black the band picked up a mass of new fans.  I miss Bon Scott's presence in the band, but Brian Johnson's vocals match the band's brand of music.  Though I don't think Brian has the range of Bon, he doesn't need it.  I won't get into the details of each track because they are all good.  Hell, the worst track on this masterpiece isn't bad.  Guaranteed to give the consumer their money's worth.
B000059LGC|5.0|In 1978, theater audiences were treated to another wonderful film adaptation of the novel \\"Death on the Nile\\", which was written by famed murder-mystery author Agatha Christie (1890-1976) and was first published in 1937.  In the story, Agatha Christie's famous Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot (played by the brilliant actor Peter Ustinov, 1921-2004), is vacationing in Egypt.  As part of his vacation, Poirot rides a steamer named the Karnak down the Nile River and visits a number of ancient Egyptian sites along with an assortment of other guests on board.  Played by an all-star cast, the other guests include the elderly & wealthy Marie Van Schuyler (the incomparable Bette Davis, 1908-1989), her nurse/assistant Miss Bowers (Maggie Smith), the very wealthy Linnet Ridgeway Doyle (Lois Chiles), her newly-wedded husband Simon Doyle (Simon MacCorkindale), her maid Louise Bourget (Jane Birkin), Simon's ex-girlfriend Jacqueline De Bellefort (Mia Farrow), the noted romance author Salome Otterbourne (Angela Lansbury, who has often played one of Agatha Christie's other memorable detectives Miss Jane Marple in the 1980 film \\"The Mirror Crack'd\\"), her daughter Rosalie Otterbourne (Olivia Hussey), boyfriend James Ferguson (Jon Finch), businessman Andrew Pennington (George Kennedy), Colonel Johnny Race (David Niven, 1910-1983), Doctor Ludwig Bessner (Jack Warden) and the Manager of The Karnak (I.S. Johar, 1920-1984).  The mysterious murder of Linnet on board the steamer begins an investigation by Poirot, who is assisted by Colonel Race, and leads to many interesting possible motives by many of the guests.  Can Poirot solve the mystery before anyone else might be murdered?  You'll just have to watch this compelling film to find out. <br /> <br />Filmed in Egypt, the views of Egypt along the Nile are breathtakingly beautiful as the mysterious story in the film unfolds.  The film won its only Oscar nomination for Best Costume Design (Anthony Powell).  It was also nominated for severalBAFTA awards, including Best Actor (for Peter Ustinov) and two separate nominations for Best Supporting Actress (Angela Lansbury and Maggie Smith).  Anthony Powell again won the BAFTA for Best Costume Design.  Memorable scenes in the film include the visit to Temple of Karnak, the visit to the four statues of Ramses II, the discovery of the murder, Poirot's questioning of various guests and the final scenes of the film. <br /> <br />Overall, I rate \\"Death on the Nile\\" with 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it to any mystery film aficionado.  Peter Ustinov was always brilliant in any role he played and is sorely missed. It is also probably the best film that John Guillermin ever directed.
0385507755|5.0|Before i bought this book i was told that i need to devote my full attention to it. No magazines and no other books that i am reading on the side, just the one book. I made sure i wrapped up everything i was doing, even the morning Metro, before i opened the book. Nothing was missed after the first page. Now after completing it, the only thing i can do is look for someone else to pass the book along to. You find yourself feeling everything and even things you couldn't relate to you understand. The fury, the fight, the family. Something just made this book connect and i only hope that when i pass this book on to the next person, it will do the same.

B0000029DD|5.0|There is no real way to categorize Jeff Buckley. Perhaps this is because of his amazing array of musical interests including artists from Edith Piaf to Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan to Led Zepplin on.<br /><br />However, one can simply state that this CD is wonderful. Small moments of perfection abound from the way Jeff's voice breaks when he is being pensive and subtly emotional to the way it soars with an accomplished range. The covers are made his own, especially with the beautiful \\"Hallelujah.\\" This CD is truly one of a kind.<br /><br />My favorite song on the album is the thoughtfully sweet \\"Lover, You Should've Come Over.\\" Other standout songs (although all of them stand out) are \\"Mojo Pin\\" and \\"Grace.\\"
068987474X|4.0|This book is funny, candid, and insightful. It's so engaging I read it in one sitting.  Even though it offers what some might call common sense advice, we all need to be reminded of how relationships are supposed to work (and that doesn't mean what one person alone should do to make them work!).  I'm tired of \\"wasting the pretty,\\" and I'm glad Greg and Liz have encouraged me not to settle for anything less than what I deserve.
0064407667|1.0|In fact I'd be very careful giving this to anyone under 13 or anyone who was molested. I looked over these books a few years ago when my daughter was still in her mid-teens. I decided these weren't for her no matter how bizarre her sense of humor is. It's very hard to find books for preteens and teens that have NO mention of sex at all in them. When the trailor for the movie came out she decided to look at the book and see(at 19) if she'd enjoy it. She read most of the book except for the last 20 pages hoping it would get better. She hated it, and said if she were younger she would have been traumatized by it. Spoilers ahead...<br /><br />She was horrified and disgusted that a grown man who is supposed to be their surrogate father decides to marry his newly adopted daughter-who is 14. Plus took the baby, tied and gagged her and hung her from the rafters because she was crying. The dark humor is lost on children, I urge you to be careful giving this to young ones. This is more for the children inside of adult readers.
B00005JKG7|5.0|Drifting at a slow and leisurely pace from start to finish, much like the titular weather phenomenon, \\"The Fog\\" is a sleepy, creepy, and highly effective thriller, sporting some familiar faces to the world of horror (specifically, the mother/daughter team of Janet Leigh and Jamie Lee Curtis, who are not, by the way, playing a mother and daughter in the film, with virtually no screen time together at all), and effective direction from the man who a year before gave to the world \\"Halloween\\", John Carpenter.  The two Carpenter films I am the most familiar with, both \\"The Fog\\" and 1995's \\"In the Mouth of Madness\\", are very similar in that they both take place in small, isolated rural towns located just on the edge of something mysterious and unexplainable, and a similar feeling of unease therefore permeates either one.  Being from a very small town myself, out in the boondocks of Nebraska, this feeling evoked by both films strikes a particular chord with me, and probably explains why the two of them appeal to me so much.    Over the course of two terrifying nights, a mysterious fog is creeping out from the ocean and moving against the wind into the little town of Antonio Bay, shrouding everything in its path with a blanket of darkness and a succession of supernatural occurrences.  Poltergeist-style activity gives way to mysterious murders, while the town's local priest, Father Malone (Hal Holbrook), makes a shocking discovery which explains everything ... but will his knowledge stop the inevitable and bring an end to the horror before it's too late?    Though it possesses a very simple story and a surprisingly short running time, \\"The Fog\\" is a great movie thanks to the effective style which it uses to tell its story to us.  The sight of the glowing fog, moving silently out form over the water and into the streets of Antonio Bay is a very eerie one, made even worse (and by that I really mean better) by the sight of the shadowy figures lurking among its gloom (take a look at the cover to get an idea of what I'm talking about).  A few odd things which are never explained (the undead shipman and the piece fo the wooden sign, for example), do not distract from the fact that they don't impact the story that much, for they work so well on their own that they only make viewing the movie a richer and more mysterious experience.  Attention should also be given to the quiet but excellent musical score, composed by Carpenter himself and played simply and effectively on nothing more than a piano and synthesizer.  Though highly reminiscent of the \\"Halloween\\" piano melody, I was particularly taken by the music which plays and repeats as the closing credits roll ... I often enjoy putting the disc in just to bring up the end credits just so I can hear the music play.  Very well done, indeed.    MGM has released \\"The Fog\\" in a very nice special edition, with a couple of highly interesting extras, among many others which I admit I wasn't so interested in.  First of the two is a brand-new documentary on the film, approximately thirty minutes in length, with retrospective comments with most everyone involved in the movie, with the notable exceptions of Holbrook and Curtis.  Second is a nice commentary track with director Carpenter and producer Debra Hill.  Also included, but of less importance to me, is an older documentary, produced about the same time as the movie, which relies too much on clips from the film for my liking, plus a number of other bonuses.  In addition to all of this, there's a nice Easter Egg on the special features menu.  See if you can find it!    I will conclude all these remarks by saying that \\"The Fog\\" is a short but well-made film which glides through from start to finish at a slow but never dull pace and will most certainly be enjoyed by anyone who's a fan of horror films, ghost stories, or any of the members of the cast.  There's plenty of bonus material for the movie fan with little else to do, and if you buy it today you'll have another film to add to your collection that you can revisit again anytime you like (and I'm sure you'll want to often).  Go ahead and go for it!    Carry on Carry on,    MN
B000002J6F|4.0|Even at its digitally-remastered best, \\"Manassas,\\" released by one of many ostensive supergroups that emerged in the early 1970s, sounds somewhat subdued and bass-heavy.  Because of this idiosyncracy, younger listeners might be put off by the sound without understanding that, like everything else in popular music, sounds and recording styles go through eras.  That said, it should be noted that this somewhat flat, but always intimate sound, was intentional, part of the roots rock tradition that began in the mid- and- late-1960s.   <br /> <br />In fact, the legend that is Manassas probably wouldn't be what it is today had it not been for the group's overall sound.  A number of contemporary performers--most noteworthly, Pete Yorn--have tried to replicate Stills & Co.'s exquisite musical balance, but all have failed, their attempts flailing all over the ultra-modern recording tricks they think are going to update a classic mix.  <br /> <br />In 1972, in the aftermath of the breakup of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young the previous year, Stephen Stills teamed up with old friends: Chris Hillman, Dallas Taylor, Joe Lala and others--to create what Stills himself believed would be the group CSN&Y should have been.  It had been evident to listeners already that Stills was either experimenting or had found Jesus.  Particularly with multi-part harmony, his first solo album played with gospel choirs and particularly with blues sounds his old compadres were loath to touch.  With Manassas, Stills, a musician who once tried out for \\"The Monkees\\" TV show but was rejected on grounds of his non-image-worthiness, discovered the perfect vehicle for experimentation--and for a number of fine songs that are really too Stephen Stills for anything other than a Stephen Stills album.  Stills always had a strong sound as it was, and it probably lent tinder to his many musical misunderstandings and big group breakups.  With Manassas, Stills was finally financially able to control the scene.   <br /><br />What we hear now are the powerful and sometimes almost overwhelming four- and- five-part harmonies of \\"Both of us (Bound To Lose),\\" \\"Colorado\\" and \\"Jesus Gave Love Away For Free.\\"  The harmonic blending is often beautiful.  Today, it's especially refreshing to hear five different voices in finely-arranged harmony when the typical fare amounts to a studio-bred hothouse tomato: four part harmonies, every voice belonging to the soloist, whether it's Britney or Cher or Alanis Morrissette or whomever. You'd think the big producers of popular music would have more sense than chiming four versions of the same tinny voice into a harmony.  Apparently not.  Stephen Stills did have the sense not to make that mistake on Manassas.  <br /> <br />However, in some respects, experimentation was merely another word for excess.  Take, for example, some of the muddier acoustic cuts, songs in which Stills and friends combine two, three and sometimes even four acoustic guitars: \\"Bound To Fall\\" presents a muddy shimmer that verges on a whirlpool of twanging 12-strings banging up against 6-string solos and rhythm parts--to the point that the jam ends up sounding a little more tangled than probably intended.  Was Stills merely responding to his fans who wanted more and more of the accoustic blending found on CSN albums?  Who really knows?  It's still a great song that more than likely sounded even better live than in studio.   <br /> <br />Not too surprisingly, Manassas was a vehicle for Stephen Stills.  While the influence of Chris Hillman is evident in many places, you get the impression that many of the musicians merely went along for the ride because Stephen Stills was a big name in the music business at the time.  After all, Stills here always gets the first billing, and even his name is in larger print on the recording's cover art.   <br /> <br />Manassas, moreover, was only one in a long series of cross-pollenations between groups as widely divergent as the Byrds, The Flying Burrito Brothers, CSN, and later reincarnations of old names such as The Souther, Hillman, Fury Band and Firefall.  All in all, the overall mingling of musicians created a seminal sound in American roots rock, a sound that remains relatively underground to this day.  Songs like \\"So Begins The Task,\\" \\"It Doesn't Matter,\\" and \\"Johnny's Garden\\" are classics most classic rock stations ignore in favor of familiar old chestnuts that were more widely embraced.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I've been waiting a long time for this to be released on DVD and could not wait to get mine. As said before, the sound and screen are incredible - it's hard to believe the movie is that old, yet looks so crisp on DVD. As for the added stuff, I think it add to the movie, some would say that Mr Lucas ruined it by doing it, but those people need to go back in their parents basement and go back to jerking off to pictures of Carrie Fischer. I don't need to tell you to buy this DVD, because who wouldn't want to own them. It reminds me of how me and my boyfriend play with our light sabers and wear our star wars gear. I once whacked him in the face with mine and procedded to tea bag with such force that he blacked out and awoke to find that he couldn't sit for a week.

It raises some serious moral questions about what it means to be human, what is real and what is not. With a plot so detailed it could make your head spin, Ghost In The Shell is a must-have for the serious anime collector.  Many have drawn parallels between Ghost In The Shell and The Matrix.  Having seen them both, that conclusion is justifiable.  Mere words do not do justice to what is arguably the best anime in the past two decades.  Go get Ghost In The Shell and find out what you've been missing.
B0002Y69NQ|5.0|I thought that when Revolutions came out in theaters that my life had been completed in every aspect.  But then I heard about this 10-disc bad boy a couple of months ago.  My life has gained a new-found purpose for the next couple of months.  That purpose is to get this boxed set and watch it all.  I have been waiting for December 7th, 2004 since March 31st, 1999.  The day that I complete this I can die happy.
B00003CXCT|5.0|At the risk of sounding hopelessly naive, or far<br />too brusque for those millions who sweat blood<br />over which STAR WARS edition is best, I'll simply<br />say this: the original film trilogy from the late<br />1970s and early 1980s is finally available on DVD.<br />Between the digital remastering (even sharper than<br />what creator George Lucas did in 1997), and the<br />necessary retooling that Lucas did with each film<br />as technology grew to match his imagination<br />(particularly where the climax of RETURN OF THE<br />JEDI is concerned), this 4-DVD set is worth the<br />long wait.<br /><br />While I prefer the deeper speculation and greater<br />sophistication of the current STAR WARS films, the<br />priceless value of the original trilogy cannot be<br />denied. Tapping into the heart of Samurai ethic,<br />Zen contemplation, Saturday matinee thrills, and<br />the wildness of the times from which they came,<br />A NEW HOPE, THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, and RETURN<br />OF THE JEDI struck deep into viewer attitudes<br />and corporate beliefs with a straightforward<br />tale holding an array of subtle twists within<br />its outwardly simple storyline.<br /><br />\\"Fractured fairy tale\\" might be one way of<br />discerning the heart of this STAR WARS saga.<br />Consider the basics. The Damsel runs off<br />with the Charming Rogue, while the Adversary<br />in Black has more in common with the Blonde<br />Hero than either realize. The Good Guys are<br />as much from the savage and the bizarre as<br />they are from the highly cultivated and the<br />purportedly enlightened; each facing extinction<br />unless they overcome their prejudices, and<br />work together to defeat the true enemy.<br /><br />There are no absolutes here. The Adversary<br />in Black is compelled to redeem himself,<br />while the triumphant Blonde Hero feels<br />that he must stand apart from all.<br /><br />Whatever else had to be fought for since,<br />STAR WARS has proven that a tale of SF<br />and Fantasy could hold mass audiences,<br />and reap financial fortunes while<br />weaving a story of considerable<br />ethical value and narrative<br />delight.<br />With his imagination, his discipline,<br />and his drive, Lucas has influenced<br />a cavalcade of talespinners, from<br />Ridley Scott (BLADE RUNNER, LEGEND)<br />to J.

0201633612|3.0|In reading this book I felt as though I were on a see-saw. Some concepts are described so clearly and succinctly (often an isolated paragraph or even just a sentence) that I felt I was really learning from the book. At other times, the examples were so academic and so far from useful in my day-to-day work, that I felt I was wasting my time.  <br /> <br />I bought this book because you if you're serious about using patterns, you have to be able to say you've read and understood it, but ultimately there was much less practical information than I had expected.
B00003CXB4|5.0|I remember watching this back in the 90's. It kicked ass then and it kicks ass now. It sure as hell beats the living hell out of The Lion King 1.5. Hell, The Lion King 2 beats the living hell out of TLK 1.5, and that is a sad thing considering TLK2 sucked.    Animation 10/10 - Back in the days, this was some of the best. The way the camera moves, the way expressions were made, and the little details most of us fail to catch was drawn. This was an indication of high quality back then and an indication of a lot of money now.    Story 10/10 - The story is nothing new, of course, but the presentation is unbelievable. The story had class. It did not rush things, but it did not draw things out either. Things were done just right. It knew when to speed things up and when to slow things down. An ability rarely seen nowadays. I believe everybody knows the story, and if not, then you should be ashamed of yourself. I've met homeless hobos who haven't watch TV for ten years who knows the story to this movie.    Music 10/10 - I loved EVERY piece in this movie. There was not a single song I did not like. In the beginning, the songs were snappy, happy, and represented a carefree childhood. Later on, the songs become darker, but hopeful to represent a new life for the pride. Either way, each song was composed masterfully.    DVD extras 8/10 - The extras are not bad, but I was hoping more for the new song \\"Morning Report\\". Instead, it was crappy.    Value 10/10 - This is a timeless classic no one should miss. Of course, if you rather watch Lilo & Stitch, I'd understand.......that you have crappy taste. This movie is one of the best of its era and it shines through.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|.......and it seems in everyone elses as well.  This record a consistent modern day masterpiece of moody indie rock.  They're also Canadian, which seems to be a big plus nowadays in indie rock.  From bands like Broken Social Scene to more little known acts like Raising the Fawn, Canada just keeps producing great band after great band.  But getting back to the record, \\"Funeral\\" is simply stunning from start to finish.  There are obvious standouts like the majestic opener in \\"Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels)\\", and the pulsating \\"Neighborhood #3 (Power Out)\\", but really every track on here will blow you away sooner or later.  When people say it is the best record released on Merge since \\"In the Aeroplane Over the Sea,\\" I have a hard time arguing against it.  Really worth checking out.
B000002UVX|4.0|This is a tough one for me, as I LOVE what Jimi was doing on here playing-wise, his usual brilliance and bluesiness in full bloom. Yet something wasn't completely right.  <br /> <br />For me, the fault lay in the rhythm section or at least 1/2 of it, namely Buddy Miles. Between his mediocre vocals and even more mediocre hamfisted and extremely limited drumming, it kept this set from being the masterpiece I think Jimi wanted it to be. If only the fluid and far more talented Mitch Mitchell was on hand for this, it would've rated 5-stars for me no problem. <br /> <br />But,, the Buddy Miles problem aside, there is still plenty of brilliance and fireworks to be enjoyed from Jimi as he coaxes all manner of sounds from his Stratocaster and musically lays his heartt out in full view. No matter what, he sang and played with so much heart and adventure.
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|Yes,his voice was ragged.He was terribly ill when he recorded this,but with his last breath,he put more feeling into a song than any of the so-called superstars of today,who think screaming is singing.His singing has always evoked a lot of emotion in me,whether joy or sadness,but I felt so lucky to be able to hear the voice of the Genius my whole life.The duets on this CD are good,but honestly,I bought it because I knew there would never be another new album.I cried like a child when he died,and I still get a lump in my throat when I hear him sing on any of the many CD's of his I own.This album was his last,and if you love him,you will accept the fact that he was a 73 year old man who was dying,but who gave his all to the recording of this last album.There will never,ever be another Ray Charles.
0385512104|3.0|Haddon's novel is a complex look through a simple lens at life and relationships.   <br /> <br />While most of us get mired down in the emotion and details of life, Christopher (the protagonist) instead is more concerned about -- through no choice of his own -- what color food he eats and how many red cars he sees on the way to school.  He is not immune, however, from the complexities of life around him, and he is drawn into the messy relationships of his parents and others as he attempts to solve the mystery of who killed the neighbor's poodle. <br /> <br />While poignant, funny, and a quick read, this novel was in no way ground-breaking or new.  Authors have been looking at the world through \\"alternative lenses\\" for a long time, perhaps most notably William Faulkner with The Sound and the Fury.  But that doesn't mean you shouldn't pick up this book and give it a read, it's worth the time.
B00003CXCT|4.0|Like most \\"children of the 70's and 80's\\", I've been waiting for this boxed set for a long time.  <br /> <br />Lucas has once again adjusted the films a bit, although this time strictly for continuity (despite what other reviewers have said, there WAS a change in \\"EMPIRE\\" as to who played the Emperor...I hope it's not a spoiler to also state that a major change in the related dialog was that the Emperor here simply begins to SUSPECT that Luke is a Skywalker, whereas in the original and 97 versions, both he and Vader seem to already know this).   <br /> <br />The picture looked great on all of my gear...very solid and sharp.  I detected no unecessary darkness or brightness.  The sound was also noticeably improved with most dialog being exceptionally crisp.  I would have liked to have had an isolated music track, though, although I suppose I can always just buy the soundtracks. <br /> <br />Most annoying was probably the length of animation in the menus before it lets you do anything.  Luckily, you can hit the Chapter Forward button on your remote to skip most of these sequences...a bit of an oddity as most DVDs won't let you do that.  After watching the bonus disc and then Episode IV, I was already tired of the menus and ready to be able to just pop in a disc and watch the movies without a lot of thumb twiddling. <br /> <br />The inclusion of so many TV spots and trailers was welcome...I LOVE trailers.  I could have done without the video game content...better in my mind to have included a disc of related spin-off material.  A couple of the better DROIDS cartoon episodes...or an Ewoks TV movie or two (hehe)?  Or actually, any of the specials that ran on TV shortly after Episode IV was released!  Entertainment Tonight spots.  MTV News.  There are dozens of historically interesting clips that fans might like to have had.  Toy commercials could have been a neat addition as well (surprised that there was no stand-alone documentary on the licensed toy phenomenon that StarWars helped launch). <br /> <br />As far as the movies go, they were transferred well, look and sound great, and one can see how well this first trilogy dovetails with the second.  But if you expect gobs and gobs of bonus features, they aren't here.   <br /> <br />Assuming that there will at some point be a \\"complete\\" boxed set of all 6 movies, this set is a very good \\"meantime\\" collection to satisfy Star Wars fans until that happens.
0634022296|4.0|I wished it had songs that they did not write like \\"Words of love\\" and some others they recorded.But if you are a Beatles buff and play the guitar this book is a must.Simple to understand.There is a glitch, it seems that some of the songs page listings are wrong so you have to hunt for them.But very pleased with this book and the price you can not beat....
0425173755|5.0|Having never read any Agatha Christie, I wasn't sure exactly what to expect.  Being the most, or at least one of the most, revered of Christie's works, I chose to give Murder on the Orient Express a look-see.  It did not, suffice to say, disappoint.<br /><br />As the Orient Express train travels from Istanbul to Paris, there occurs(get this) a murder.  Big shocker for Agatha Christie, right? Well, that's where the banality ends and the intricate guessing game begins.  With 12 passengers from seemingly very diverse backgrounds traveling in the same railroad car, our intrepid protagonist, Belgian sleuth Hercule Poirot, finds the mystery a most baffling and perplexing conundrum worth investigating.  Undoubtedly an easy and fun read that is an absolute must for any fan of mystery works.  Aussi, si vous pouvez parler un peu de francais, il est tres utile pour ce livre.
B0002234LS|4.0|Johnny Depp. To speak these two words would bring virtually any woman aged 15-35 to her knees. Right now, Depp has a monopoly on the male heartthrob market not seen since four Liverpool gents first toured the States. I don't know what it is about Seor Depp, but I do know what I saw.  <br /> <br />After purchasing my ticket for \\"Secret Window,\\" I was spellbound to see almost a 3-to-1 female-to-male ratio in attendance. Anyone who has seen the trailer for \\"Secret Window\\" could tell you this film doesn't exactly belong in the chick-flick category.  <br /> <br />Jeepers, and I thought Marlon Brando still grasped the flame of desire in the hearts of women at home and abroad. I mean, sure, the innovator of method acting has plumped a little around the midsection since his \\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" days, but c'mon.  <br /> <br />With that aside, \\"Secret Window\\" tells the story of Mort Rainey (Depp), a recently divorced writer who simply cannot shake the mental image of his former wife (Maria Bello) sleeping in bed with another man (Timothy Hutton). He caught the two red-handed at a seedy motel while he and his wife were still married.  <br /> <br />At any rate, a Mississippi man, John Shooter, pays the beleaguered Rainey a visit. Shooter insists Rainey robbed him of one of his stories.  <br /> <br />John Turturro plays the enigmatic Shooter to perfection. In truth, Turturro is a much under-appreciated actor. Whether the part calls for a bug-eyed Hollywood screenwriter in \\"Barton Fink,\\" or a smug beneficiary to his father's pizza shop in \\"Do the Right Thing,\\" Turturro consistently delivers.  <br /> <br />On the second visit by this un-stately stranger with a fully brimmed black cap, Rainey inquires as to when Shooter typed up his identical story. Shooter, without hesitation, says 1997. Rainey seemingly puts an end to the argument when he claims that he, in fact, wrote the story in fall of 1994 and had it published in a magazine in early 1995. \\"Not so easy,\\" says Shooter in a starkly Southern drawl. \\"I wanna see this magazine, if it does exist.\\"  <br /> <br />Meanwhile, as Rainey desperately tries to get a copy of the publication, strange things begin to happen. He discovers his dog dead with a screwdriver through its skull. Then he and his ex-wife's house burns to the ground as the target of arson.  <br /> <br />Here is where I will halt my procession. All I can tell the reader is nothing in this film is what it seems. Personally, I made the mistake of assuming too much. It backfired like Quin Snyder's technical foul with his team trailing by 16 to a blue-and-red-dyed dodo bird.  <br /> <br />The film is an adaptation of Stephen King's novella \\"Secret Window, Secret Garden\\" and is definitely mainstream King, the modern-day master of literary horror. So sit tight, buckle your seat belts and clutch the theater armrests, because you're in for one death-rattle of a ride.  <br />
B000002JQ6|5.0|It goes without saying that AC/DC remains one of the top Hard Rock bands of the 20th century.  After all these years I still feel that they are in the top 25, residing somewhere around the top ten, maybe even number one.  If you dispute that, oh well, we all have opinions and you know what opinions are like.  <br />The songs on this album are their best and remain as always songs that we can all relate to when it comes to AC/DC.  If you are an AC/DC fan then you must add this album to your collection.  As always they rock and this album definitely kicks ass.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Francis Ford Coppola was a directorial gold mine in the '70s, fashioning such landmark cinema as \\"The Conversation,\\" the first two episodes of \\"The Godfather\\" and what I roundly consider a bonafide cinematic gem, \\"Apocalypse Now,\\" only to fade from memory with the onrush of the '80s.  <br /> <br />These days, Coppola is semiretired from filmmaking in lieu of garnering up the reins to producing. As executive producer to such cracks at, as my faithful film companion puts it, crap - he raked in the greenback for \\"Jeepers Creepers\\" along with \\"Jeepers Creepers 2\\" - it makes one ponder whether Coppola's mind is gradually withering not unlike Colonel Kurtz's.  <br /> <br />On the contrary, as one Coppola mind dissolves into non-being, another has sprung from the smoldering familial ember. This individual is none other than his tremendously gifted daughter, Sophia Coppola.  <br /> <br />In her most recent film, \\"Lost in Translation,\\" the Coppola progeny has engineered an aesthetic marvel of a motion picture. In a medium bungled by editing and cinematic relapse, Sophia Coppola has flung at the silver screen a movie that trounces convention. Thematically, \\"Lost in Translation\\" reads like a Saul Bellow novel; although effervescent with comedic spunk, therein lies a spiritual configurative that is the true heartbeat to the film.  <br /> <br />Bill Murray portrays Bob Harris, a MacGyver-esque has-been who, due to his overriding celebrity status overseas, is offered a sum in the seven-digit range to endorse a whiskey product with a Japanese label. He accepts the proposal and sees the month-long engagement in Tokyo as an opportunity to slip away from the day-to-day obligation of a father/husband.  <br /> <br />In spite of being treated as a demigod by the East Asian peoples, Harris can't slow the onset of midlife crisis. Sure, he adores his children and still feels a sliver of compassion for his wife, but the pruning effect of age is taking its toll physically and emotionally.  <br /> <br />The luster of yesteryear has blended into the horizon for Harris, who extracts whatever grain of esteem he can while crouched over on a barstool slurping the very booze upon which he glosses his signature.  <br /> <br />Fortunately for Harris, a magnum opus of beauty and charm is around the bend. The feminine masterwork is a soul-searching Yale graduate, Charlotte, expertly depicted by cinematic newbie Scarlett Johansson.  <br /> <br />She, like Harris, is dejected by the insipidness that steadily encompasses her. For instance, her fashion photographer of a husband has neither the time nor the ardor to suit her needs. He cares more about the coloration of a studio backdrop than her yearnings for attention.  <br /> <br />Eventually, Harris and Charlotte strike up casual conversation to the tune of a tangy rendition of \\"Scarborough Fair,\\" and what unfolds from there is a romantic escapade that would flutter the pulse of even your most loveless dope. It is a platonic courtship that truly tweets like a Beethoven symphony. What a brilliant, brilliant motion picture.  <br />
0767817486|5.0|Look guys. I definitely recommend this movie. It's one of the best ones I've ever seen. No kiddin though I'm from Turkey.Surprised?You should be because as a movie this one deserves 5 out of 5. Well flip side of the coin is of course about my country. Don't take the junkies at the movie serious.Watch this as you watch Shawshank Redemption.This isn't and wasn't Turkey.I didn't even understand what those Turks(?) in the movie was sayin' Ah yeah this was Armenians who tried to speak Turkish.Somethings may have happened 30 years ago in that prison but this is not different than what happened in Robert Redford's Brubaker.And what about the court scene in this one. \\"You Turks don't eat pig but you are all pigs, your food suck, let me .... all your people women bla bla bla\\" Nobody blamed American culture in prison movies. Nobody made any generalizations about any culture in any prison movie but this one. So, from a cultural standpoint this movie is nothing but a manipulation, provocation, scandal, illusion and a total lie.Mentioned earlier, watch this so-called true story as you watch Shawshank. You will simply love it. Do you know more than half of what was said it happened didn't really happen? Well, anyways, enjoy the ride!
B00005JMJG|5.0|The screenwriting brainchild of such inventive cinema as \\"Being John Malkovich,\\" \\"Confessions of a Dangerous Mind\\" and \\"Adaptation\\" has done it again.  <br /> <br />Yes, Charlie Kaufman is, hands down, the most brilliantly clever screenwriter in Hollywood. Yes, \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\" is every bit as fantastic as the theatrical trailer made it appear to be. Yes, believe it or not, Jim Carrey's performance is a tour de force in humorous subtlety surpassed only by his characterization of true-to-life sitcom bait in \\"The Truman Show.\\"  <br /> <br />Director Michel Gondry has fashioned a psychedelic masterwork that will likely rattle the impatient moviegoer like a wooden roller coaster. For those of you who don't like your noggin to be tickled and gouged during a journey to the theater, I definitely don't recommend this one.  <br /> <br />Joel Barish (Carrey) is a melancholic loner who has grown weary of his girlfriend, Naomi. It is while Barish is sitting on a set of steps overlooking a beach party she has presumably thrown that his pupils become lustfully fixated. Splashing in the tide is a big-lipped, blue-jeaned beauty with her hair dyed an inexplicable shade of red. Eventually, this woman visits Barish, and after the initial jitters, the two hit it off. He learns her name is Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet).  <br /> <br />Kruczynski's attitude tends to fluctuate with the hue that coats her locks. When she awakens in political furor at the start of a week perhaps she'll slather her curls with the color Green Revolution. But if she feels especially threatening to societal values, maybe a dime-sized deposit of Red Menace on the scalp will suffice.  <br /> <br />In spite of their differences, the two share a romantic courtship that, for the most part, is functional though some of the abrasive inner workings.  <br /> <br />One evening, Barish says the wrong thing and Kruczynski trots out of his life for what he thinks is a temporary leave. He couldn't have been more mistaken. The always-impulsive Clementine immediately opts for an experimental procedure that permanently erases unshakable memories. She wants to forget Barish for all of time and move on with her life.  <br /> <br />The problem is no one told poor Joel the news. Cluelessly, he attempts to apologize to her at her workplace. He becomes frustrated when she looks him in the eye without the faintest recollection as to who he is.  <br /> <br />Ultimately, Barish gets to the bottom of the madness via the slip-up of a friend named Rob (David Cross), and so he too decides to undergo the operation. But in the midst of the process, he realizes his experiences with Clementine, regardless of the definitive falling out, are among the most golden of the currency in his memory bank.  <br /> <br />Can Joel manage to hoodwink the rapid-fire erasure by tucking away treasured memories of his dear Clementine in his private past? Or is Dr. Howard Mierzwiak's (Tom Wilkinson) method too fine-tuned?  <br />
B000286RKW|5.0|I am not a fan of Martin Scorsese . He is a very talented film maker but with his last works he seems to be in a zero atmosphere . From Cape fear to his last work ; something 's wrong seems happen .<br /><br />But fortunately before this strange path happened , he made his last giant work .<br /><br />Warning that 1990 was a battlefield in the mob movies ; this one ; Godfather III (the worst of all the saga) ; State of grace and the best of that group (Miller's crossing) .<br /><br />Goodfellas is an extraordinary organic piece . Filmed with artistic commitment but also with a superb flowness and naturality that it lets you astonished .<br /><br />Scorsese adds a high dosis of black humor in all his characters . They are all involved in such kind of divine madness , that you copnsider the sucesive murders as something completely natural .<br /><br />What can we say of De Niro in this role . When De Niro works with Scorsese , there is something inside the soul of Robert which seemed the happy result of that &ntilde;ong chemistry among them through the time . De Niro is not the same poweful and natural actor under other director . This rapport is so clear (Casino , Mean streets , Taxi driver ; Ragging bull ; New York , new York)that it looks like more than evident to conclude this overwhelming phenomen is just casuality .<br /><br />Pesci is so great , so cynical and Ray Liotta in his finest role to date .<br /><br />The film is artistic a real jewel . They are good kids , good sons , they are excellent gourmets and unique husbands , and they do their job as you or me ; they kill and you can refy}use this behavior ; but for them is a matter of living . That is their job . So what's the point with that ?<br /><br />If I had to take two films of Scorses to the desert island ; I would take this and his masterpiece : Taxi driver .
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Another artistic and commercial failure such as \\"Mars Attacks!\\" or \\"Planet of the Apes,\\" and Tim Burton might have seceded into non-being.  <br /> <br />However, let it be known that in Burton's latest film \\"Big Fish,\\" he has fashioned perhaps his ultimate achievement. In this, his 11th major motion picture, Burton has deftly interspooled fantasy with reality as never before, creating a film that sparkles with mythological glamour.  <br /> <br />Whether it's the supposed halting of time when true love is stumbled upon, landing that slippery belle with a band of gold in the river of fortune or assisting 14-foot giants in their quest for realizing their equally-as-giant ambitions, \\"Big Fish\\" is a work of utter resplendence.  <br /> <br />Are the improbable events that roll off of Edward Bloom's graying tongue simply tall-tale rubbish of a life that might have been, or is there something more? Who was this man behind the inventive veil? The theme of the film revolves around this riddle, as dad-to-be Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) sits bedside with his dying father, Edward Bloom (Albert Finney), in order to sift fact from fiction before it is too late.  <br /> <br />In flashback, Will Bloom recalls the stories his father told him, trying to relay them just as he remembers. We hear of a shriveled witch with a black patch covering up her right eye that, when stared into, will reveal one's means of death and the heaven-like town of Spectre, an isolated township that, when accessed by a major road and big business, wisps into a state of dilapidation.  <br /> <br />Not to mention Karl, the aforementioned giant, played wonderfully by Matthew McGrory, who gobbles up entire cornfields overnight and has driven the townsfolk to talk of murdering the behemoth.  <br /> <br />If not for the helping hand of Edward Bloom, Karl very well could have wound up a fictional afterthought, a spooky subject of campfire make-believe. Further still, there is the tale of a once-great poet whose creative reservoirs go dry all of a sudden, only to find his calling in the least likely of professions - thanks to Edward, and so many others.  <br /> <br />By the conclusion of the film, the viewer cannot help but come to the realization that although a lot of what Edward says is not completely true, a great deal of his farfetched stories are closer to the truth than one can ever know.  <br /> <br />The bottom line is the people within his tales are indeed flesh and blood, and their lives were undoubtedly touched by Edward's selflessness. No, Edward's fib of the factual was not a reflection of his need for attention. Rather, its purpose lies in breathing imaginative vigor into those individuals he had the honor of befriending along his life journey.  <br />
B00003CXCT|4.0|The Star Wars trilogy has finally come to DVD and it looks GOOD.  It sounds GOOD.  My primary complaint though, is that things have been changed.  I don't mind adding something here or there, though there was nothing wrong with the original.  It's just that some things don't match.  While most of the movies got a complete digital makeover, the faces of the people remain relatively unchanged.  This makes the film seem without a time period.  Overall though, it looks great especially the second two films.  However, the ending to Jedi has been changed, and in my opinion ruined. SPOILER:  Rather than have a quick ending with a little celebration and a catchy YUB YUB song, its replaced with a bunch of different planets celebrating, Anakin is changed to the new anakin, and an extended Ewok celebration of CG graphics.  Ewoks doing flips and cartwheels to new music is not my kind of an ending.  You can't fight Lucas, and who knows when he will release the originals as they were, so go buy it, and maybe if you watch the film enough you'll forget how it once was, and enjoy it for what it is.
B0002F6BRE|4.0|\\"Elf\\" is one of those films that is guaranteed to change the viewer in one way or another. For instance, I awoke the morning after feeling a little strange, and instead of my regular routine of showering and such, I found myself tapping on my roommate's door still donning nothing but a pair of boxers.  <br /> <br />As soon as he answered, I burst into melodious song and dance. With me patting my feet like an imbecilic Michael Flatley and tweeting like a vocally warped Chiefs fanatic, my roommate must have thought I was out of my mind.  <br /> <br />For the remainder of the morning, all was branded in normalcy - that is, up until I realized the Bran Flakes I was chomping contained every semi-sugary morsel in the house - including bits of a stale Kit Kat bar.  <br /> <br />In \\"Elf,\\" Will Ferrell plays Buddy Elf, a 30-something human raised by elves at the North Pole. One day Buddy is scolded for missing the quota for Etch-a-Sketch production by nearly 900. It is at this time that Papa Elf and Santa decide to sit Buddy down and tell him his true identity and the whereabouts of his biological father, a \\"naughty\\" executive in the children's book business.  <br /> <br />As a matter of fact, his pops (James Caan) is such a Scrooge that I was expecting a barrage of whizzing bullets to rip him to shreds at any instant; luckily, for his sake, Francis Ford Coppola wasn't on the production team, and no tollbooths were in view.  <br /> <br />So anyway, Buddy is given a snow globe featuring the building of his old man's workplace in New York City - the Empire State Building - and is sent on his way with best luck from all of Santa's helpers. Tromping through Candycane Lane and Sugarplum Grove en route, Buddy indeed locates the Big Apple without a problem. But, the question remains, will his father accept him as his own or treat him as some chemically imbalanced mistake?  <br /> <br />Go figure that if Ferrell would commit such humiliating acts as stripping down to his bare buttocks in \\"Old School\\" or literally pissing his drawers on MTV, there exists no exploit this man would turn down. Whether it's consuming a sweet-tooth concoction of maple syrup and noodles, spinning dizzy rounds in a revolving door or sporting tights with cramped elf footwear, one can't help but chuckle at Ferrell's immaturity.  <br /> <br />In all honesty, when I originally heard of Ferrell's latest project, I thought to myself, \\"Oh, no, could he be selling out like Roberto Benigni did in the positively wretched \\"Pinocchio?\\"  <br /> <br />Be it Ferrell's kooky merriment or the omni-presence of old-time Christmas claymation creatures, this film glows with the same holiday cheer as \\"The Santa Clause.\\"  <br /> <br />Furthermore, what I found thoroughly appetizing was camera manipulations that give Ferrell a larger-than-life contrast to the elf world - the same effect used in the \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" series. Witnessing Ferrell bumble and tumble about in a diminutive milieu was quite a tummy chortle.  <br /> <br />Obviously, I was not fully aware of Ferrell's comedic acting range or of director Jon Favreau's filmmaking competence. \\"Elf\\" is, as standardized a phrase as this may be, the feel-good comedy of the year.  <br />
B00005JN2X|5.0|Since the very start, Mann takes his time to develop depth in this movie's characters.   Spending valuable plenty \\"Hollywood minutes\\" from the onset, to allow Jada - THE hyper sexy professional prototype and Max -the hero cabdriver of this flick-, to show their chemistry surfacing through sharp dialogs, gives you the feeling you're not for the conventional thriller plotline/ride.    And this movie is a about that.  The adrenaline rush, the violence, the cool steely demeanor, hired killer - philosophy, are props -aside from highly entertaining.  The peek into the murderer's killings & mind, the steely aesthetics, the beautiful \\"smelly\\" portrait of a rough L.A., are just supportive of the central human theme.  This movie is about a very common & contemporary human struggle.  Some may say the  most important issue.  Max is a blue collar worker with a dream.  That dream keeps his child spirit alive, and that of most of us striving in the middle.  There is a twist in his perspective: He's not selling his blood for a company.  He's sacrificing his current life to fulfill a dream, of owning a limo service with a unique vision.  He also dreams of island far away, that he keeps a picture of on the cab of.    But conflicting with that is a man with basic needs and fears thereof.   He has bills to pay and people depending on him (his mother).  In twelve years driving a cab he has not been capable of \\"taking the dive\\", risking his security to pursue his dream.  That dysfunctional fear that naturally lingers in all of us, extends to other areas of his personal life.  He is incapable of risking emotionally, either.  Doing things in which he cannot control the outcome, and pain is at stake.  And he knows it.  Especially evident in the intro segment with Jada, when he's pain and shame are reflected in his face, when he's unable to ask the lady for a second contact, after he knew clearly they hit it off.  He sees her walking away from him, and aches.  He's inertia is leading him tosuffering, anyway.  Fox, conveys all that with a few expressions.  Masterful performance, all the way.    Cruise (Vincent) is the devil and also bizarre angel, in his shoulder.  When Vincent's identity is settled for Max, is clear his life is the antithesis of Vincent's.  Vincent lives a life of danger and risks.  No chance to hesitate or blunder.  His payoff is much about for  those risks he takes.  Here Cruise doesn't stick to your head, a much underplayed solid work, where you don't feel as watching someone act.    During the \\"ride\\" with the devil, Vincent taunts Max's with his evident self- deceit.  Vincent confronts him with a painful outlook.  The future we all dread. A future in which we find ourselves old one day burying the young illusions, with no chance of changing our lives, and dying with remorse for the dead dreams.  That becomes the salt in the wound he needs to awake from his stupor.    Vincent and Max, as in other good guy - bad guy centered screenplays, are similar guys.  Vincent's cool, roll with the punches- improvise on the spot-high level mercenary behavior seem appropriate with his taste of music. One with the appropriate tone: Jazz.  A beautiful, masterfully written and directed piece at a Jazz club, lets us know a side of a cultured Vincent, who knows about Jazz history and understands the craft.  He praises the improvisation quality.  You can sense his love for it.    By the same token, and complemented with Vincent's depiction of his sad childhood, you can suppose that a man with such sensitivity could have a different life. Just as Max.   And deep inside, he knows it.  He despises what he does. Although full of  satisfying (for him) rationalizations for his actions, that he blurts to -of all people- the cab driver, that entertains us fully during the film.  Ethically shallow, but sufficient to appease superficially a man whose life is also shallow.    Both characters seem oppressed by their circumstances, fears and past.  But at the end are paying the price for not exercising their possibility to choose a different path.  Both are escaping reality in very different ways.      Beyond his urgency for someone to take blame of the crimes and his need to focus on the jobs to perform, there are other reasons to stick with Max.   Besides, not showing his face, he shows reasons beyond that for keeping Max, especially when Max starts to show as a liability for the \\"project\\".  Furthermore, Max's life been a pseudo-living, breathing justification for Vincent's exhilarating line of work, there is a connection that Vincent wants to keep.  One of those, the fact that those hourly connections are the only relations he has with other people.    The movie is the awakening of a man.  That change hints the promise of a new life.  In this ride, not taking risks is not an option. Not, if wants to protect the same security he cherishes.  It's a change or die deal. That awakening is also catalyzed by pride.  He won't sink lower. He won't betray another value, especially not his romantic values.  On top of that he had a night's example of another male, who does whatever is needed to get what he wants.   And finally he acts in 360 degree angle from his regular life.    The ending, which is the only \\"traditional Hollywood\\" segment that indulges the audience with a happy closure, has been criticized a lot.      I believe that although it insinuates Max's life is going to dramatically improve, you're not left with the certainty.  And it surely reminds us, the flavor of irony we extract from our own life's events.  Arranged like a puzzle only by the protagonist of each life.  With logic that resembles that in Jazz.  And Mann, as a great composer, leaves you with a feeling that this ending had the beautiful consistency of that logic.    Not everything in the plot original: Yes.  Much better played than many other films: Yes
B0001DI0FI|4.0|I am beginning to believe Russell Crowe is currently the most consistent working actor in terms of starring in quality productions. Of his last nine feature-length films, four were nominated for Best Picture, with \\"Master and Commander\\" a likely candidate at next year's. Of those four nominations, two - \\"Gladiator\\" and \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" - went on to win the grand statuette.  <br /> <br />Crowe's recent work is so popular it is no wonder he has been spotted sipping booze with the likes of the Weinstein brothers. In other words, moviegoers haven't seen an act such as Crowe since prime-time Jack - as in Jack Nicholson circa 1969 through 1989.  <br /> <br />What's more is that Hollywood's leading man is despised by the cinematic powers that be. In an industry now ankle-deep in mediocrity, banking on a successful opening weekend rather than long-term commitment, studios can afford to drop a rank egg and still pocket some sort of profit. Quantity over quality is the mindset. Even though most big-name actors occasionally subscribe to this method, Crowe outwardly stands against such deceptive ploys.  <br /> <br />To be sure, the day I witness Crowe making a cameo in some Hugh Grant/Sandra Bullock chick flick is the day Marlon Brando reveals he is in fact an otherworldly humanoid.  <br /> <br />In director Peter Weir's latest triumph, \\"Master and Commander,\\" Crowe plays Capt. Jack Aubrey, an Englishman so fierce that the year's other Capt. Jack - Johnny Depp's Capt. Jack Sparrow - pales in comparison. In fact, if Jack Sparrow can be considered a loose caricature of Keith Richards, then Jack Aubrey is a rigid depiction of Ted Nugent.  <br /> <br />With 197 souls under his thumb, Lucky Jack - as he is affectionately known - is the commander of the HMS Surprise and has orders to intercept the Acheron, a revolutionary French privateer headed by a man just as intelligent and gritty as Aubrey himself.  <br /> <br />Shot to appear phantom-like in the foggy waters off the Braziliancoastline, it is the Acheron that deals the first blow after somehow gaining insight to the Surprise's position. With a mighty barrage of firepower, the Acheron handily whips the Surprise in their first encounter, but through uncanny leadership Aubrey is able to slip away behind the blanket of fog and avert total disaster.  <br /> <br />However, as sung through the vocals of Vera Lynn, \\"We'll meet again/ Don't know where/ Don't know when.\\"  <br /> <br />Weir takes the opportunity to acquaint the spectator with the crew. Each on-screen construct, no matter how miniscule the role, is true to life. This sets \\"Master and Commander\\" apart from the \\"Pearl Harbors\\" and \\"Wind Talkers\\" of the world. Granted, \\"Master and Commander\\" is an action film. However, where most contemporary films of the genre resort to such lows as gushy love triangles to complement the medley of special effects, this film relies on faultless acting, a superb script and exceptional camera work. Three irrefutable fail-safes, if I may say.  <br />
B0002OERI0|5.0|ive been a green day fan since i was 14 and ill listen to anything theyll play, but i still find the songs from the 94 album dookie are my favorites. american idiot has blown me away, its just as well written and as well played and you find yourself at the last track without having to skip any of the others. the great factor with american idiot is its reference and response to just whats goin on in this country. i think this album couldnt have come at a better time and is without a doubt just as good if not better than dookie. older and newer fans should be able to find even ground with this one.
B00005JMEW|4.0|For those of you who wish to see Quentin Tarantino's wiry hide thrown overboard and be made mincemeat of by barracudas, well, better luck next cinematic go-around. In his first feature-length film since \\"Jackie Brown,\\" Tarantino has shuffled the cards and somehow produced a remarkable hand once more.  <br /> <br />\\"Kill Bill Volume I\\" - the second and final volume is due out in February - relays the redemptive mission of The Bride, aka Black Mamba (Uma Thurman).  <br /> <br />The reason for her deathly disgruntlement lies in a botched slaughterfest at her countryside wedding some four years earlier. Five homicidal professionals, formally known as \\"The Deadly Assassination Viper Squad,\\" ended The Bride's matrimony with a cloud of firearm discharge.  <br /> <br />Splattering the innards and brains of all those present, including the groom and the chaplain, the lethal fivesome then turned its attention to The Bride, who was a couple of weeks shy of childbirth. The clan opened its barrage with a coarse rendition of \\"Ring Around the Rosy,\\" in which The Bride was flung from person to person, each member imprinting a mark of ache on her chin. To finish her off, the head honcho, Bill, launched a point-blank bullet into the right side of her skull.  <br /> <br />Seemingly, this makes her the 10th victim of the execution; however, it is soon discovered that the projectile merely dislodged a cranial plate, preserving her brain, but leaving life in coma. Four years pass, and, thanks to the blood-famished proboscis of a mosquito, the Black Mamba rises from the dreariness, childless and hardly able to move.  <br /> <br />Bent on payback, The Bride first must manage to make operable her appendages. She is eventually able to rehabilitate herself.  <br /> <br />Once physically capable, The Bride composes a hit list she calls \\"Death List Five.\\" The list is as follows: 1. O-Ren Ishi, code name Cottonmouth (Lucy Liu); 2. Vernita Green, code name Copperhead (Vivica A. Fox); 3. Elle Driver, code name California Mountain Snake (Daryl Hannah); 4. Budd, aka Sidewinder (Michael Madsen); 5. Bill (David Carradine).  <br /> <br />For starters, The Bride sets off to eliminate Green in her suburban bungalow. As soon as Green answers the call of the doorbell chime, she is embattled in a rowdy till-death-do-us-part knife scuffle with The Bride, only to be interrupted by the arrival of her daughter's school bus.  <br /> <br />However, as soon as the munchkin climbs the stairwell, the skirmish rages on, and the blood-stained Bride waltzes away victorious.  <br /> <br />But it remains an uphill hike for The Bride. She must fly to Tokyo and quarrel with Ishi and her henchmen known as the \\"Crazy 88.\\"  <br /> <br />\\"Kill Bill Volume I\\" is an eye-popping bloodbath made complete by flawless dialogue, a scintillating musical score and stylized camera movements. Hell, there's even an homage to Japanese anime, used splendidly to show the youthful disturbances that led to Ishi's ascent to the position of Tokyo crime boss and assassin.  <br />
0515123447|4.0|This was an excellent, suspenseful, action-packed book. I really enjoyed it.<br /><br />Reacher, an ex-military cop, is passing thru a small Georgia town and is falsely accused of murder.  He eventually is set free but he finds himself in the middle of a corrupt, organized group of thugs which includes the mayor and the largest business owner in the town.  Coincidently, this group of thugs has killed his brother.<br /><br />Reacher sticks around to seek revenge on the killers and figure out what led him to this strange place to begin with.<br /><br />Lee Child does a great job on this premier.  He has you at the end of your seat from the start.<br /><br />I am really looking forward to the next one of this series.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|Director Errol Morris' latest triumph, \\"The Fog of War,\\" is a retrospective glance at some of America's toughest times, including World War II, the Cold War and the Vietnam War. These haunting moments are revisited through the view of Robert McNamara, secretary of defense under John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson.  <br /> <br />McNamara stares right into the eyes of the viewer as he recounts his past, from his time as an Army Air Force lieutenant colonel to his stint as Ford Motor Company president to his work as defense secretary. We see McNamara as a faultless chap at the University of California at Berkeley in 1937. We discover McNamara's part in the development of seat belts, an invention that would reduce the incalculable number of injuries caused by automobile collisions.  <br /> <br />We also learn of a botched firebombing over Japan that resulted in about 100,000 civilian casualties, a raid for which McNamara was partly responsible. Making this scene even more mortifying is McNamara's unflinching expression as he relays the event with hardly a grain of remorse. McNamara speaks of the avoidance of total nuclear war as sheer luck.  <br /> <br />\\"Take it from me, we were literally this close to mutually allied destruction,\\" McNamara barks, as he narrows the gap between his thumb and index finger to nearly a pinch.  <br /> <br />During a recorded telephone conversation in 1965 with President Johnson, we hear McNamara's voice wither into nonexistence in protest to the commander-in-chief's vow to escalate the conflict in Vietnam.  <br /> <br />In the film, McNamara outlines 11 lessons he has learned during his turbulent life. Below are three that come to mind:  <br /> <br />Empathize with your enemy: McNamara said that had the United States attempted to empathize with North Vietnam, the conflict may have subsided with little loss of life. McNamara said that while the United States' purpose in southeast Asia was to prevent the further spread of communism, North Vietnam saw the conflict as a civil war between two radically different governing factions.  <br /> <br />Seeing and believing can both be wrong: McNamara places emphasis on the incident at the Gulf of Tonkin. Was there or wasn't there a second attack? Was President Johnson's full-fledged bombing strike premature?  <br /> <br />Proportionality should be a guideline in war: It's shocking how many Japanese civilians were killed or wounded during World War II before the United States dropped the atomic bombs.  <br /> <br />Overall, the viewer gains a humanistic understanding of McNamara through this film. But even at 85, McNamara still won't elaborate on the more scintillating pieces of information, such as whether he thinks LBJ was mistaken in his efforts to accelerate the \\"crusade\\" in Vietnam.  <br />
068987474X|5.0|I don't think this book is telling us to sit back and wait and do nothing. I think it's important to be an independent woman. I DO think that we over-analyze situations; I am 35 and have come to believe that if a man is interested, he will call you. It's that simple!! I don't believe the \\"hunter-gatherer\\" thing either - I just know that if a man likes you, he will call and pursue you. If he's too busy, too scared, too freaked-out, etc, would you really want him in your life?
B0000024YL|5.0|this is the CD to own if you want to only own one CD of this type (or, for that matter only one Simon and Garfunkel CD). <br />Sure, you can get \\"Bridge over troubled waters\\" by about 25 other people (including, Elvis Presley, Jim Naybors, the Jackson 5, etc...) but this is the one that everyone knows and loves. If you haven't heard the catchy rhythm of \\"Cecilia\\", you really really need to get this CD. It is great as background music and also works cranked up to clean the house, or pay bills to. (Depending on your mood!)
B00005JMFQ|1.0|Not only is this movie trashy, it's boring.  I was amazed to find Hugh Grant & Liam Neeson in a movie without wit or energy.  The promo people found the best in the movie & made it look appealing.  The clips in their actual setting were the highlights of the movie.  We fianlly decided we had wasted enough of our time & turned it off.
B00004U8H4|4.0|This movie along with the book shows off the worst of a man in a \\"master of the universe\\" context in Wall Street. Basically, it's purgatory in Yuppie hell, with only guilt complex and knowledge about his psychosis tormenting Bateman (Christian Bale).  <br /> <br />Bateman represents the embodiment of what a successful young, single, white yuppie living in the 80's in upper class New York would do in any given day. Eating gourmet food, drinking hard liquor, doing coke, working out extensively, clubbing insanely and of course, goofing off work by watching television or listening to your favourite walkman. He's a walking, talking perfection of what a greedy, materialistic and ultimately insecure creature of the 80's. He's the product that Michael Douglas in \\"Wall Street\\" would love. <br /> <br />This DVD edition is the unrated NC-17 cut. Highly recommended, even though you just get a few more seconds of simulated sex. However, the extras are quite disappointing. Would love to see a fully loaded 2 disc special edition in the near future.
B000001DTM|5.0|I don't know about other people's tastes, but I have a weakness for edgy passionate semi-dark atmospheric & gritty music with melancholy tinges, which is why I worshipped this album on a daily basis.     The songs' textures are really much richer and experimental than anything they've ever done (zooropa & pop are debatable). The guitar solos & chord progressions- omFg!, really make this album a classic, unlike crap you hear on radio nowadays, they're not boring chords repeating over and over, there are actual melodies in the background, and they morph and mutate over time, some patterns are very similar to classical music in my opinion even though apparently it's rock, and the orchestra effects are icing on the cake. The intros (UV Light my Way, Acrobat - my 2 favs, e.g.) are enticing and suspenseful, like song intros should be. Also what I love about them are the bridges/climaxes, it's like ascending up & down on the rollercoaster hill before going down the steepest slope.    I don't know why so many ppl are praising 'all that you can't leave behind' as one of their best, musically i think it's their worst and most boring. For music listeners who want to experience journeys and stories instead of being fed boring formulas, get this album.
B00005JNEI|5.0|All I can say is, whether you're liberal or conservative, Democrat or Republican, you should see this movie. Granted, Moore does occasionally go overboard, particularly with his assertions concerning 2000. Nevertheless, Moore hits home on a number of facts and does not mince any words (or images for that matter). He shows the aftermath of the bombing raids on Baghdad and displays the discontent felt by more than a few of our troops in Iraq. In addition to the serious and occasionally disturbing, Moore also injects a bit of humor, particularly with his statement about Bush spending so much time on vacation; his interviews with House members (especially Porter Goss, our new CIA chief); his quest to inform Congress about the Patriot Act via an ice cream truck; and humorous looks at John Ashcroft, Paul wolfowitz (so that's why he's so slick), and of course Dubya himself. Some people may criticize Moore for depicting Bush as in idiot, they forget that Dubya provides most of the ammunition. In total, this is probably the most provocative and important film of the year, but don't take my word for it. See it for yourself.
B00003CXCT|3.0|I have been a Star Wars fan (not fanatic) since I was 6 years old. I can't believe the total disregard that George Lucas has for his actors, especially Sebastian Shaw (last seen on ROTJ). <br /> <br />I think that if we are unhappy with the changes on this trilogy, we should return the copy back to George Lucas and write him a letter to tell him (as someone said) \\"Lay down the mouse and step away from the computer.\\" <br /> <br />PD: Hayden Christensen is as bad an actor as Keanu Reeves. :D <br /> <br />The only good thing about this revised film, is the picture and sound quality.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I for one enjoy the changes. I love Episodes 1 and 2 and making the connections to the last three episodes is awesome. Remember the last three episodes weren't actually finished in 1983 (when ROTJ came out). George never intended for the movies to look that way. Sure nothing was wrong in them except for the, what we call now even though it was not back then, poor graphics. Remember Hayden is not only the Anakin from episode 2 he is now the Anakin. Yeah sure I understand that some people take offence to the changes who grew up watching the last three episodes as kids. I would really hate it if someone changed LOTR by having a different actor play Frodo or something, but it makes sense for Episodes 4 through 6. I like the final scene change with Hayden as Anakin. It reminds you of how he used to look like when he was good before he turned to evil. And Ian (the emperor) did play in ROTJ so it makes sense for him to overtake that puppet in ESB. I dont believe that the voice was changed though. In the ending credits it still had that actor's name (not Ian) as the voice of the Emperor. If people do not like these versions then well that is too bad. You would not have complained if these are the versions you first saw (I have seen the originals) back in 1977. See these are the versions of the movies that were in George's mind back in 1974 (or maybe before that) when he started on this saga (minus Anakin at the end though and Boba's voice). It would have been better if Padme Amidala was put in to persuade Luke that there is still some good in Anakin and then persuading Anakin to help Luke when he was getting ... well electricuted ... at the end. Then it would have made more sense when Hayden turned up in the end probably with Padme in his arms. But unfortunatly there was no way to do that and it would have looked too awkward if attempted. Get serious though ... these are George's movies ... what he did was not a crime and people should take the prequels into consideration and be open minded that the 1980 films were not the ones supposed to be shown. Maybe he should have waited until the first three were completed to release the final three, but he did change movies forever, you cant forget that. All I have left to say is too bad we will not see Ep. 7 through 9 ... that would have been something eh? Oh well. Just wait until Ep. 3 ... I think it might just change people's mind. Or I can at least hope.
B000022TSW|5.0|South Park is incredibly underrated. People see it only for the swearing and the political incorrectness. They pay no attention to the real comedy. This movie was a true work of art. I was stunned when I first saw this movie. I expected it to be funny, but I didn't know I'd be laughing my ass off and sitting at the edge of my seat for 81 whole minutes! After seeing this film, I became a devoted fan of the South Park series.    But enough about how I felt about the film; every opinion needs backing! (And I find that a lot of reviews here lack that sort of thing.) When this film started, I was greeted with a musical number. It was entertaining at best; it kept my attention. Then the boys entered the theatre. I felt like such an idiot for laughing at all the fart jokes of Terrance and Phillip, but I never was the type who pretended to have such a superior and highly intellectual sense of humor that I couldn't enjoy senseless comedy. As the film continued, even when I didn't laugh at the jokes, I still found myself smiling at the empty spots; the movie had drawn me in. But then things got more interesting--the kids got busted for swearing, Kenny set himself on fire, the mothers started a protest against Canada, and eventually the United States was thrown into war with its neighbor to the north. From there, the movie got even more hilarious and crude. Not only that, but it had something special to it--a special gleem that made this film a special place in my heart. It has its touching moments, its exciting moments, its musical moments, and of course, its moments of senseless comedy. All-in-all, it was pure genius. It had the magical feel of a Disney movie, but was much less child friendly. To wrap it all up, it had a moral to it (like just about any episode of the show), something a lot of critics and censor freaks don't even seem to notice. The moral made sense and made you feel for the characters. This kind of depth and development in the characters surprised me--I never expected to feel this way about South Park.    I don't want to ramble on and spoil the movie for anyone who hasn't seen it, so in conclusion, this film was brilliant. It was honestly one of the best films I've ever seen. Several of the best recent films have had moments that simply made me think twice about praising them. This film, on the other hand, gets 5 stars, pure and simple. I don't even have to think twice about it; there was never a dull moment. It wasn't just a great comedy--it was a great movie altogether. It had all the elements that make a movie great. I'm rambling again... I don't have much more to say except buy this movie! If you find yourself disappointed, do yourself a favor and lose the holier-than-thou attitude and get a sense of humor!
0140177396|5.0|I read this at the recommendation of my girlfriend.  I was surprised I hadn't ever had to read it in school.  The one thing that I really liked about this book was the characterization and dialogue.  Maybe I'm reading the wrong authors, but it seems like a lot of dialogue in fiction is too uniform between the characters.  Meaning they all pretty much speak in the same way...use the same word choices.  In other words, it's like all the characters are really just speaking the way the author would.  This book is great because Steinbeck includes all the vocal and character nuances in the dialogue.  It really helps the character development and helps make the story feel more \\"alive\\".  this book is pretty short, but remarkably fleshed-out for such a small book.  It gives just enough background info on George and Lennie and other characters that you feel you know them, but it doesn't drag on and over-do it.
B000067J1H|5.0|I had been avoiding this film for ages, for reasons unknown to myself, or those who had recommended it. All of a sudden, quite recently, 'Fight Club' became rather annoyingly ubiquitous, by chance, and I saw the film everywhere, and everyone was all of a sudden telling me how I needed to see it. <br /> <br />I finally saw it, and I am so very glad that I did. <br /> <br />I can't give away too much for those who haven't had the pleasure, but it's the story of the sprouting of an underground terrorist group, in the form of secret meetings of 'Fight Clubs' around the country. The first rule of Fight Club is to not talk about Fight Club. The second rule of Fight CLub is to not talk about Fight Club... But when more and more people become acquainted with the group, Norton's 'unnamed' character becomes more and more suspicious of 'friend' Tyler. <br /> <br />The Fight Clubs intensify, and eventually evolve into soap selling, explosive creating, doers of mayhem working together to defeat capitalism and the unnecessaries of life. Ironically, their common quest for difference drives the army to becoming more and more the same. <br /> <br />The film's ending was unquestioningly impressive. Although one could argue it's cliche-ness, I found it rather inobtrusive, and unpredictable, giving the film very satisfying closure. <br /> <br />Overall, I found the performances by Norton, Pitt, and Bonham-Carter to be incredibly sublime, and the cinematography to have a real gritty feel to it. 'Fight Club' is unquestionably a five-star film in my book!
B000025RX4|5.0|If you love Johnny Winter and love guitar jams you will love this--the sound,however, is not as great as the LP-this should be remastered--hopefully the domestic version will be remastered when it is released. Rick Derringer and Winter go thru some nice guitar battles on this CD--the tunes are great-well written--Funky Music is a 6 minute guitar battle that fades out at the end  (why is this? Should have kept going)I saw Johnny Winter And at the Fillmore when this LP came out-it was great-2 hr set -2 sets-my ears were wrecked-could hardly hear for two days after---so loud---GET THIS CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005JNEI|4.0|I saw this movie in the theater and have read 200 of the reviews already posted on this site before posting my own.  I soon noticed that people who gave poor reviews to the film stated how much the film lied and how biased it was. You can make those statements but you have to support them. It's not enough to say the film tells lies, you need to tell us what the lies are and support your claim with evidence. Few reviews do this. Also, many of the people who gave the film one or two stars admit to not watching the entire film, some admit to not watching it at all.   <br /> <br />This documentary does a good job, if anything, of raising questions. It explores the connections of our current government to big oil companies currently at work in Iraq and Afghanistan, it explores connections between the Bush family and Saudi Arabia, it explores the social and economical makeup of the kids surving in our military, and it explores our efforts on the homefront to keep our country safe post 9/11.  <br /> <br />Was there some fancy editing? Of course. Every good movie has good editing. Were there some lies told? Of course there was. The decision to pull the Bin Laden family out of The U.S. after the attacks was not Bush's. One of the great things about our system of government is that through checks and balances, Bush, or any president, does not have that power. Be smart enough to realize you're being lied to, but then ask yourself why you hadn't heard of any of this before the movie came out. Who's hiding what? <br /> <br />Also, anyone blaming George W. for the 2001 attack on the World Trade Center wasn't paying attention in 1993. Remember, the car bomb in the basement that injured a few hundred people? Bin Laden had an obsession with the WTC and wanted it gone, and would stop at nothing to get it done. In my own mind, I assume that Bin Laden attacked on 9/11 not because he hated George W., but because he failed to level the buildings in 1993 and it took him almost nine yearsto come up with a plan that would work. If Gore had been in office on 9/11, the buildings still would have been attacked and we would have tapes of Gore sitting in a classroom instead of Bush. Michael Moore draws some of his own conclusions in this film and I did notice how careful he was to point out his own opinions when he wasn't presenting fact. I encourage anyone watching this film to draw their own conclusions as well. <br /> <br />This film does do a good job of raising questions about our current government. At times it gets long and drawn-out. At times it gets confusing. The plot at times jumps around like a Quentin Tarantino piece and doesn't always make it back to home base.  <br /> <br />Once again, unlike most who reviewed this, I'm not making a political statement. I have no left or right wing. I don't know who I'm going to vote for yet. I'll wait until after the debates to do that, as any American should. If Bush is as dumb as this film makes him out to be, it will show in the debates. Keep in mind that even if you come away from this movie hating George W., you have to ask yourself if Kerry can do a better job, this movie doesn't do that for you. If you walk away from this movie and don't have some serious discussions with your friends about it - whether you agree with it or not, I think you've missed the point.
B00005O5CM|5.0|I LIKE THIS MOVIE. AT FIRST, I THOUGHT THIS MOVIE WAS GOING TO BE LIKE CLUELESS. I LIKED CLUELESS A WHOLE LOT. BUT, ELLE SHOWS WARREN SHE DOESNT'T NEED HIM. I WAS SO GLAD WHEN SHE HAD TURNED HIM DOWN. SHE WON THAT CASE. I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT HIS FIANCE HAD BROKEN UP WITH HIM. THE VANDERBILT. WARREN WAS STUPID FROM THE BEGINNING ANYWAY; WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO MARRY SOMEONE BECAUSE OF THEIR LAST NAME. SHE SHOWED HER BEAUTY INSIDE AND OUTSIDE WAY TO GO!!!!
B0002Y4TZG|5.0|You'd have to have a hard heart to deny Joe's ex and Mick and Paul one last payday.  I remember buying this record in September of 1980; two records for a list price of $7.98, a year later they'd release Sandinista (three LPs!) and list it at $9.98.  This at the same time that Columbia was asking $11.98 for Bruce Springsteen's two-LP The River and $14.98 for The Wall.  Joe always had a keen sense of the thin wallets in the pockets of his fan base. <br /> <br />I remember bringing this record back to my dorm (fall of my freshman year) and dropping the needle on Side 1.   It didn't matter who you played it for -- skinny-tie new wavers, heavy metal freaks (this was the year of AC/DC), Jefferson Starship fans, CSN fans -- no one could deny the genius of it.  I wore out all four sides in this order -- Side 1, Side 3 (Elevator!  Goin up!), Side 4, Side 2.  These days you can have all 4 sides (no flipping, no wear!) for $10.98.  It's still the best bargain in rock history. <br /> <br />Or you can have this thing for $26.98 (hey! down to $24.98!).  There's nothing essential on the Vanilla Tapes, though I'm still glad to own it.   The DVD, like all such \\"making-of\\" endeavors, is best avoided.  The full-size fold-out lyric sheet is welcome.  Whoever decided to illustrate the broadside interior and several pages of the booklet with generic 50s \\"sock-hop\\" clip-art should meet the same fate as the Card Cheat.  But all in all, it's a generous tribute to a band that was once \\"the only band that matters.\\"
B0001NBMEE|4.0|There is such a sense of childlike wonder and fun in Henry Hathaway's 1954 Camelot tale, PRINCE VALIANT, that it's easy to forgive the obvious incongruities in accents (Robert Wagner's broad American tones...hard to believe he plays Donald Crisp's son...Sterling Hayden, looking and sounding more like Wild Bill Hickok than Sir Gawain...Victor McLaglen as the most Irish Viking you'll ever see!), and concentrate, instead, on the energy, pageantry, and sweep of Hathaway's adaptation of Hal Foster's classic comic strip.<br /><br />Certainly, one would be hard-pressed to assemble a finer cast; in addition to Wagner, Hayden, McLaglen, and Crisp, you have James Mason as the villain, Sir Brack, dazzling, and far more believable than he had been as Rupert of Hentzau in MGM's remake of THE PRISONER OF ZENDA; Janet Leigh and Debra Paget, both ethereally beautiful as the sisters, Aleta and Ilene; and Brian Aherne, as King Arthur, so perfect in the role that you wish his part had been larger.<br /><br />In the early 1950s, there was a resurgence of swashbuckling films in Hollywood, and a new sub-category appeared, 'Knights in Training', with Fox's PRINCE VALIANT, and Universal's THE BLACK SHIELD OF FALWORTH (starring Tony Curtis) both devoting ample screen time to the education of squires in the knightly skills of jousting and sword fighting. These scenes are great fun to watch, particularly for children (knights had to go to school, too!), and paint a far more accurate picture of the difficult work involved in mastering the required talents than did the recent film, A KNIGHT's TALE.<br /><br />As we follow the adventures of the Viking Prince as he restores his kingdom, finds love, and wins a place at the Round Table, special credit must be given to Franz Waxman's spectacular music. One of the most memorable scores ever produced for a film, the theme has become a staple at the Hollywood Bowl, and for the Boston Pops. Once heard, it is not forgotten!<br /><br />While the magical elements of the story are downplayed (the mystical powers of the 'Singing Sword' are more implied than actually shown), the story itself has such a sense of wonder that it isn't missed. The heroes of Camelot are all present (Arthur, Lancelot, Guinevere, Gawain, and Galahad), and the Round Table scenes are as majestic as any film has ever accomplished.<br /><br />PRINCE VALIANT may not be in a league with EXCALIBUR, but it certainly holds it's own against KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND TABLE, CAMELOT, and FIRST KNIGHT, and as a family film it can't be beat!yed (the mystical powers of the 'Singing Sword' are more implied than actually shown), the story itself has such a sense of wonder that it isn't missed.

B0002S943O|3.0|i was frustrated on the video quality, like on the other review it truly is \\"grainy\\", i even own the VHS devotional and watched like 20 times and i never complain on the video quality <br /> <br />audio is the best part of the DVD (PCM & 5.1) <br />i'd rather turn-off the TV and just listen to the tracks (that's how bad the video is)  <br /> <br />
B0002VKZL6|5.0|I find this album to be another mature step in Mark's career. Great project! The album moves at a perfect mellow tempo and sports new gems I'll be listening to for a while. I feel there will always be guaranteed satisfaction with the group of guys Mark plays with, namely Bennett and Fletcher.   <br /> <br />I get pretty disappointed in people when they feel they automatically need to compare latest efforts with earlier efforts, etc...Take it as another step, another project, and stop trying to find the Dire Straits in his material. His signature guitar/voice will always be present in most of the projects he undertakes.  <br /> <br />I will thoroughly enjoy this new gift of music...
B00008H2LB|5.0|Ill admit HT is probably more creative, but I found this CD to be more solid and have better hooks/more catchiness. The songs are mostly more slow and \\"epic\\" like \\"Numb.\\" The best song Is \\"Breaking The Habit,\\" Im sure uve heard it, its great. The coolest hard rockin songs are \\"Figure .09\\" and \\"Faint.\\"  \\"From the Inside\\" is also cool, its slower and kinda Emo-ish. The only song I skip is \\"Session\\" b/c its just instruments. <br /> <br /> Bottom line, you've heard the radio songs, they rock just like the rest of the CD.
B0002VKZL6|4.0|When I first sampled the tracks on this disc, I was left a bit cold. Then, immediately upon the second (and complete) listen, I was once again sucked back into the Knopfler vortex. Although he never seems to really wail (had he EVER, upon reflection?), the subtle licks between phrases had me listening closer and more intently. There's a maturity which comes through on this one. There's also some elusive Earthiness I find difficult to pinpoint. If I had to guess, the tracks were recorded live rather than multiple over-dubs... which would explain the human flavor coming through. I got the definite vibe that the whole band was in a room just digging each other's presence-a garage band of mature musicians, reacting gracefully to one another's head bobs and side glances as they played. So, at this point, having listened about a dozen times, I find this collection of clever lyrics and subtle musical adjustments on an established style an amalgam of all that Mark's learned and felt over his entire career. His music continues to be a warm blanket on an arctic night and an old friend over for a beer. I don't just listen to Mark Knopler's music-I let it gently wash over me. Shangri-La is evidence of having come full circle in a career of honest music.
B00005JNEI|5.0|A must see for anyone interested in saving this country from another four years of Bush.  Sadly, Mr. Moore would not have to make films like this if our national media would do its job.  A lot of these things should have been reported in our newspapers and on our nightly newscasts.
B00003CXBK|5.0|The thing about Japanese animation is that it isn't always for kids.  We as Americans associate animation with cartoons and therefore assume they are for children.  Movies like Akira and Cowboy Bebop have a certian level of maturity and violence that is not suitable for children.  Now, though Princess Mononoke is not as violent as some others, it does have a few scenes that are questionable in terms of children's viewing.         I believe that this film is amazing not only in terms of the animation, but also in the message it gives.  It is sad but also makes you feel good in the end.         To better understand other films like this one, it is important and nearly vital to understand the culture of Japan.  I hate to burst anyone's bubble, but not every culture is like America in its values and customs. Before passing judgement on this and other animations form Japan, it may be helpful to take a class on Japanese Culture and/or popular culture.  I do, however, recomend it highly.
B0002NRRAG|5.0|Madeline Peyroux is a jazz vocalist, who on this first rate mostly acoustic disc covers Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen, and others, while sounding like a soulful Billie Holliday. The BH comparison is a bit obvious, perhaps, but Peyroux shares Holliday's wonderful vocal warmth and the modern recording techniques of course only improve things. Peyroux makes all of these songs sound like standards, which is a feat....The musicians who play on the disc are brilliantly offhand, I'll mention Dean Parks (guitar), Larry Goldings (keys), and Jay Bellerose (drums) ....perfect for a summer afternoon <br /> <br />It's an incredibly strong disc top to bottom, my favorite tracks are \\"You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome\\" , \\"Between the Bars\\", and \\"Careless Love\\"....highly recommended
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|I think Alexander will probably win the best pic oscar this year, but this is definetly a very close second.  Its really one of the best films ever made, and definetly one of the best this year.  Its alittle better then The Last Samurai but not much.  Gladiator is alittle better but again not much, this is very close to Gladiator but Alexander looks like it could be better then Gladiator.  Anyway back to this.  It has a great story, sure its different but its more interesting that way, why would you pay 10 bucks to see a movie about something youve heard a million times before.  Its got great very well choreographed fights (esspecially the one between Pitt and Bana, the climatic fight and the best part of the movie) and grand scale battles.  Its got an oscar caliber performance from Bana, and great performances by everyone else.  Its got great cinematography and visuals, a great score, and powerful drama.  Definetly a 10 out of a 10.  If you liked Gladiator then you should like this basically just as much, they are very close in terms of how great they are.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Ok honestly, I have always been a Britney fan but I was getting sick of the pop thing.  Britney obviously knows what her fans want.  If people would just give this CD a listen and even forget the bubble gum name, Britney Spears, they would see there is really good music on this CD.   It has every type of music from reggae to hip hop to techno.  It's amazing, Britney is just an amazing artist, whether she lyp syncs or not.  Here's my ratings: <br /> <br />Me Against the Music- 9/10 - Great song, popular, just a little sick of it ...great song to dance to tho <br /> <br />Boom Boom- 10/10- really hot song with the ying yang twins, really fun, catchy , great sexy lyrics. <br /> <br />Showdown- 8/10- ALthough most people don't like this song, i think it's slick.  It sounds like she is talking to Justin in this song. It's a nice song to relax too. <br /> <br />Early Mornin- 10/10- Fun song, sort of a club song, it has a catchy chorus, it was produced by moby. <br /> <br />Toxic- 9/10-  Great song, everyone knows it...not my favorite on the album or choice of single, but hey everyone loved it. <br /> <br />Outrageous- 10/10- Great HipHop Vibe from this song produced by R Kelly.  Too bad britney hurt her leg, it wuold have done a lot better. <br /> <br />Touch of My Hand- 8/10- Very intimate song, interesting , and its catchy but it has to grow on you. <br /> <br />The Hook Up- 12/10- My favorite song on the album , I really wish Britney would have released this as a single.  It's a reggae type song, and she sounds so great on it.   <br /> <br />Brave New Girl- 6/10- I'll admit, this song can be quite motivating at times, but it's beat is too poppish. <br /> <br />Everytime- 11/10 <br /> <br />Bottome Line: GET THIS ALBUM U WONT BE DISAPPOINTED!
B00005JN2F|1.0|It's incredible how sometimes a movie sometimes has the \\"blessing\\" of all the media... IT seems all of the critics are getting bribbed....<br /><br />It's absurd. They hailed this movie as a \\"smart action flick\\", \\"one that has brains\\", \\"better than the original\\". Don't believe all these lies. Whatever merits this movie may have, they are ruined by one single fact: THE EDITING OF THIS MOVIE SUC..S!! It's the worst I've seen in a long time. It's video clip / MTV edition all the way, you can not follow the car chase or the fights. It's annoying, really annoying. The camera don't star  \\"firm\\" in position for more than one half of a second<br /><br />The lack of quality of the story is another point. It's much less, I mean MUCH LESS, suspenseful than the first one. Youc an see miles away waht happened.<br /><br />I don't recommend this movie wven for rental.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I got introduced to Green Day last year when I caught a glimpse of the \\"When I Come Around\\" video on MTV one night. I liked it, so when I found out about their \\"International Superhits\\" album, I go it. What better way to get a compilation of their best songs? When I started listening to it, I absolutely loved it, but I was kind of sad that I got into them kind of late. When I heard they were coming out with another album, I was ecstatic! I pre-ordered it on Amazon.com (and trust me, I don't usually buy CDs, so me buying this CD was a big deal) and waited for its arrival.  <br /> <br />When I received it in the mail and started listening to it, I thought it was REALLY good (I consider a CD good when I like most of the songs and not just 2/20 or something). It's really a work of genius! One point about this CD that caught my attention was the bridges, how it flows between most of the songs. It's almost like one big song. This makes it really unique and interesting. I love everything about this album and I recommend everyone to go out and buy it! <br />
B0002234LS|2.0|My first big problem with this movie was that the story is simply stupid.  A guy approaches Johnny Depp, short story writer, and accuses him of stealing his story.  He threatens to start hurting Depp's loved ones if he doesn't rewrite the story properly.  I had a hard time caring.  It seemed to be so much revolving around so little, and the movie was so poorly written and predictable that I didn't care about any of it.  Finally, when the big twist was revealed, it didn't make sense with everything that had happened in the movie.      When the movie was over, I felt dumber for having watched it.  I give it two stars for Johnny Depp's performance, which made the movie at least somewhat enjoyable.  However, I still would not recommend watching it.
0440237688|4.0|I really enjoyed reading The Giver.  At first I thought the book was a little strange and I didn't understand it much, but as I got further and further into it it became more interesting.  I felt myself being pulled into the society in which Jonas and his family live.  This society is so very different than our own and it is interesting to see what the world would be like if we were all the same.  The book really stresses the importance of individuality, emotions, and memories.  As you read through the story you find that the \\"perfect\\" society isn't so perfect.  There are many flaws and things that people can no longer enjoy.  I've always wondered what it would be like if everyone was the same and now I have my answer.  I think The Giver is well worth reading.  It's not hard to understand yet it brings up many questions and really makes you think.  It's a nice book that you can sit down and easily enjoy in one day.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Being a die-hard fan as I am,  I was surprised how much I loved the changes and the DVD's.   <br />A.  The menus are incredibly well done. <br />B.  \\"The Return of Darth Vader\\" has me so excited about the new movie (not such a huge fan of I & II) <br />C.  At 35,  it's nice to turn 13 again. <br />D.  Seeing the challenges GL had to bring this to the screen was incredible. <br />I am so happy that \\"Star Wars\\" is in this world.
B00005O3VC|5.0|I am a Python fan, this has to be my favorite movie of all time. It's a shame not many people know about it. I end up watching this movie at least 4 times a month. It's that great. I could probably repeat word for word every line of the movie. I love the shakespheare subtitle thing. I wish they would make more Python. The genious of it only lasts so long. They need more french taunter stuff.
B0001YRVN4|5.0|First I'd like to say that I've been waiting years for these DVD's and bought it the day it came out. First I checked out the special features, which were great. There is a preview for Episode III, which looks good, and there is \\" Empire of Dreams\\", the most comprehensive documentary about the making of Star Wars. Next I looked at \\" The Force is with them\\", which interviews filmmakers that were influenced by Star Wars, such as Peter Jackson, Ridley Scott, James Cameron, and more. <br /> <br />In Episode IV there are a few more changes, most notably There is a new Jabba which actually looks better than it did in the Special Edition. Jabba has been changed to look more like the original puppet. Everything about him is improved and makes him seem more real. There are other various changes that are fun to look for. <br /> <br />In Empire Strikes back, there is new dialogue between the Emperor and Vader. And the emperor is Ian McDiarmid, who plays him in the prequels and Return of the Jedi. That is the biggest change, aside from other little ones like a new Boba Fett voice. <br /> <br />Return of the Jedi has the most notable change, where Hayden Christensen is the ghost of Vader at the end. They did this change because Lucas said he was the last form of Anakin before he became Darth Vader. Also there are more smaller changes. <br /> <br />These films, though changed are still as wonderful and magical as they were 25 years ago. Don't complain about changes, embrace them as Lucas does. This is his vision of how the Star Wars saga was meant to be ( if you watch Empire of Dreams you can see the struggles he faced ) and if he wants to see his dream fulfilled that is his right. He is sharing his vision with the viewers and people shouldn't give him crap over it. If you are a true Star Wars fan you will buy this and if you love great movies this is a great edition to your DVD collection. May the Force be With You! <br /> <br /> <br />

B000003TA9|5.0|And EASILY THE BEST ONE FOR INITIATES!!!!<br /><br />Sonic Youth, along with the Pixies, were one of the formative influences on everyone's faves- wunderkind- Nirvana. They were both touring together around the time this was coming out. Wow. SY even borrowed the producer (a little history: Butch Vig produced most of the sound-sculpted seminally influencial ((like it or not)) albums of the early 90's- he was the co-inventor of the Kevin Shields Sound\\"- that furious wall of distortion you hear on Nevermind, Siamese Dream, Loveless...) for this classic.<br /><br />This was their 2nd release for DGC, and boy did they take advantage of that. You can hear the advancement of production values. Now- whether you want to hear sound qulaity on an SY album is totally up for debate. Whether you think that their brand of noise-rock should go for accessibility is also a debatable argument. I stand by this release, all of it a gorgeous, furious, precision-tuned masterpiece. I remember being 13, hearing 100% and thinking- I want an album that sounds like THAT- THE WHOLE THING!!! Lurchingly sanguine and Demented fuzzed out bassline and two gnomic guitars just wailing- keening with scraps of noise, fire, a maelstrom of sonic brutality pouring out of the desperate amps... Wow. That one track (which concerns the death of their friend, Joe Cole (see Hank Rollins book, \\"Now watch Him Die,\\" his best easily) makes thIs worth picking up.<br /><br />You may be bewildered by their approach- but what sounds like utter hell is truly a very finely crafted sculpture of sound. One that they are able to reproduce with fairly meticulous and faithful renderings- live. Each song sounds utterly different, conjures a variety of images and scenes for the mind's perusal. No sleeper tracks, save for the cover of 'Nic Fit,' which is les than 2 minutes long anyway...<br /><br />(I wonder why this magic kinda subsided on subsequent releases like \\"Washing Machine\\" and \\"Jet set, Trash... their more recent releases also seem- not as magical. meybe it was just me- maybe it was the time. Who knows.)<br /><br />The brooding, sumptuous tempest that is JC- another ineluctable reason to pick this up. You can't hate that song. It is one of the most amazing pieces i have ever heard and totally stands on its own.

These songs seem like children to me. Never grow up. I put this on and sink back into my headphones and BOOM! It's 1992 again and I'm 13 and pining for my best friend, hating her boyfriend, reading Salvatore's Dark Elf trilogy, messing around with a guitar (thought I invented the e minor chord), up late at night writing bad psuedo Bryonic poetry... this Cd brings back to me the SMELL of my old room.

B0001CCXY8|1.0|This seriously is the worst thing ever not just in music but everything in general i cant believe there are five star reviews for this album and this band there album cover is disgusting and the song titles are stupid <br /> <br />Now read my lips no more cannibal corpse there awful anyone who likes them thinks they are so hard core but really your just an idiot
B0002OERI0|3.0|The artist may say Green Day, but this is not a Green Day Album.  Sounds more to me like Good charlotte or one of those new 12 year old girl type punk bands.  I saw some people say this is \\"old school\\" Green Day.  They are wrong.  That is not opinion, it is fact.  This is not old school Green Day.  I gave it 3 stars because its still decent, but I wouldnt even consider it a Green Day album.  Green Day died after Insomniac.  We can call this... Green Day II
B00006879E|5.0|Yes they are a little overplayed, but when you are in the mainstream you always have that problem. Well I usually find mainstream music to be boring and untalented garbage, but Maroon 5 showed me that there is still some talent in the mainstream. Fusing rock with R&B is nothing knew, but they are probably the most convincing at it. My fav. tracks are This Love and She Will Be Loved. Every track is pretty good, but my all time fav. track is She Will Be Loved. It is amazingly sweet and stir many emotions for me. Almost brings a tear to my eye, and that is hard to do. I say that if you like Alternative Rock or just have good taste in music, then get this CD. It's worth the price.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Thank god for DVD. I somehow missed this show when it was first aired. The show has a huge cult following, and now I see why. Joss Whedon is a master of the drama-action-comedy genre. As with the fantasy element in Buffy and Angel, the sci-fi part of the show is great fun, but it's not the heart of the show. The characters and the relationships between them are great and complex. The dialog is zippy. And each scene has incredible detail in language, costuming, sets, and plot, so you can find something new each time you watch it. It's a masterpiece, and I can't wait for the spinoff movie Serenity to arrive (...)
B0002EXH5E|4.0|Its hard to get excited about an album when even the frontman of the band releasing the album isnt excited about it. This is the case with Risk. Megadeth frontman Dave Mustaine has said publicly and in interviews that Risk isnt Megadeth's proudest moment, and that the producer of the album took it in a direction that Mustaine wasnt comfortable with. <br />That being said, its not a suprise that Risk isnt what Megadeth fans have come to expect. The album is more \\"pop\\" centered and its a far cry from the metal Megadeth pioneered. If that wasnt enough to anger fans, a majority of this album seems to be filler. <br />There are some highlights to this album however. \\"Crush 'Em\\" is a great song to listen to on your way to or from a sporting event. Its infectious beat is perfect for getting you pumped up before the big game. \\"Breadline\\" is blatant pop music, obviously aimed at getting radio time, but that doesnt mean its a bad song. A serious message about the dangers of drug addiction is hidden under the catchy tune. \\"Insomnia\\" is my favorite on the album, and the only song I can really claim is pure Megadeth on the album. <br />The bonus tracks added to this remastered version dont really add much to the album, but they are interesting to listen to a few times through. The main reason I would recommend this album is that Dave Mustaine went back and salvaged what he could of this album by remastering it. Gone are the techno effects that were slapped on top of numerous tracks. Mustaine strips the songs too their roots and rebuilds them to the best of his ability, making them listenable to most Megadeth fans. <br />If you didnt like the original release of Risk, give this one a shot. It is better than the original and Dave's comments inside the CD booklet are interesting, and shed some light on why Risk turned out the way it did. Just dont expect to find a metal masterpiece.
B00026YO36|4.0|Mark Lanegan invented grunge. He left it behind. The 1980s passed and he had passed the torch. Lanegan was influential on the band Queens of The Stone Age. As a solo artist, he has done work inspired by Tom Waits and Nick Cave. You might expect something like The Valentine Six or Firewater. Early on Lanegan is much like that. But once he gets to songs like \\"Methamphetamine Blues\\" and \\"One Hundred Days\\" he shows his own style and true colors. Members of The Queens, Greg Dulli, and PJ Harvey show up on this record. They are mostly in the background. This record really gets better with every listen. \\"Death Valley Blues\\" is really wonderful. It's good to see a real originator do quality work.
B00003CXCT|1.0|This isn't what I was expecting. This isn't the Star Wars I kept long memories of. I don't like the changes or any of the CGI. Why tamper with a piece of art? To me Star Wars was fine as it was back in 77'. This isn't what I wanted.  <br /> <br />I'm just making this short. I don't want to make a big deal, but I mean come on! What's next? Maybe 10 years from now Lucas is going to make changes again to Episode IV? What could possible he do to make it wrong? How about a scene in which Han and Luke are walking out of the Millenium Falcon and encounter that unfunny stupid clown of Jar-Jar....Sheesh!!!! <br /> <br />Lucas gone mad someone STOP HIM!!!!
B0001I561Y|5.0|The first time I saw Aladdin, I was in 10th grade. Well, I was hooked and then I saw it 25 more times, I even wore out my VHS. I had Aladdin everything and still do, so I am sooo very happy they are re-releasing it on DVD. I believe this is one of the best Disney movies ever.
B00005JN2F|1.0|Paul Greengrass, mark this name.... How can the studio approve such a lame picture? This movie is a swindle from beginning to end. Why? Let me explain. <br /> <br />We had a previously decent, intriguing, sometimes exciting spy action thriller with THe Bourne Identity. What do we hav in this sequence? Let me answer: <br /> <br />1) ZERO suspense. You can miles ahead who is (are) the bad guys. Absolutely nothing like the first movie. <br /> <br />2) How can a director, ON PURPOSE, decide to shoot a film in such an obnoxious way, using a hand camera all along the way, and ordering his cameramen to shake it, shake it,  and shake it once more, and then goes into the editor's room and orders the editor to cut from frame to frame in less than a second, along THE WHOLE MOVIE. It's not only in the action scenes. It's in the WHOLE MOVIE! It's something to wonder when a director shows such contempt for his audience, not showing ONE SINGLE fight sequence in a way that we could follow! And, even doing so, he receives a lot of reviews like \\"Oh, except for that shaky camera work, the movie is very good...\\" How can a movie be good, no matter the quality of its plot, if we CAN'T WATCH IT?? <br /> <br /> <br />The same way that Greengrass showed contempt for me (as a member of the audience paying nine bucks for watching this mess), I show contempt for him, and I do not intend to watch any more movies directed by him. I'd also like to know if Damon has been bitten by the famous \\"Affleck's Virus\\", and began to choose his roles only for the paycheck, because I refuse to believe that he got satisfied with the final editing result of this mess. <br /> <br />THE BOURNE SUPREMACY is a mess of a movei, COMPLETELY ruined by the director's choices. It's a shame that no one above him put a halt to it. Anyway, the movie is making money, so they must be proud of making audiences sick while watching it. <br />
B00000I8NC|4.0|I love Moya. It's very beautiful and emotional. BBF3, on the other hand, is kind of off. The guy talking made such an absolute fool of himself that I was almost certain that the song was a satire on anti-american people. <br />My solution? Put the record on the turntable moya-side up (this is a vinyl-only release, by the way), play it, and then never flip it over.
B000005RFQ|2.0|Yeah, I love Sabbath, and also listened to their albums with great will to like them, even when theyre nothing more than \\"Tony Iommi Project\\". <br /> <br />To rate BORN AGAIN as a five or four stars album must be a joke. The album has the dubious merit of possessing one of the worst album covers ever, and also the worst production for a Black Sabbath album. It's muddy, plain and simple. It has only seven songs, and I agree that they are heavy as hell, really, really dark.  <br /> <br />TRASHED opens it with a bang, and I just love the song. Gillan is singing all the album with the top of his lungs, his voice sounding strong and clear. But the songs simply don't take off. Sometimes they are painfully dragged (\\"Zero The Hero\\", \\"Disturbing The Priest\\") sometimes downward silly (\\"Hot Line\\", \\"Digital Bitch\\") Given a better production, this album had potential. The way it came out, it's just a black mark in Sabbath's career.
B000089RVX|5.0|I just recently discovered Evanescence by mistake after visiting a friend's web site and clicking a link for Evanescence - Hello. I absolutely LOVED the track and, having friends who were obsessed with the album and the band, naturally decided to borrow/buy the album. A friend lent it to me, and here I am, listening, several days after becoming obsessed with it myself. I just cannot stop listening to it... Amy Lee's voice is so much more polished and mature than anyone else in her age group of singers, such as Avril Lavigne, Brittany Spears, etc. It's like an angel from heaven has come down to bless us with her talent, and it's no wonder why the song &amp;amp;amp;quot;Bring Me To Life&amp;amp;amp;quot; attracted so many fans to this small Arkansas band and singer! And, without further ado, onto the ratings...    Going Under - This song is not my favorite, but nonetheless, it is a great song. The rock beat really strikes my fancy, and the lyrics are well-polished. 9.5/10    Bring Me To Life - The song that inspired Evanescence's fan base, and it's really easy to see why! The lyrics are great, the tune is wonderful, and it's really easy to pick up. It's haunting and rocking at the same time, and overall a great song. It has its shortcomings, however, as it will become really repetetive after a while of listening to it because it is so awesome! 9.5/10    Everybody's Fool - A great song, but it's basically repeating the same thing, merely in different words, through the entire song. 9.5/10    My Immortal - After listening to all of the album and Hello before it, this was my new favorite song. As another reviewer put it, it may be what heaven really sounds like. This is one of the band's songs that you hear everywhere, like Avril Lavigne's Sk8er Boi, and you just instantly love it, but you just never know who the artist is... then you find out, get the album, listen to the song and the rest of it, and become obsessesed instantaneously! Its haunting lyrics and beautiful piano make this an instant classic, not to be missed. 10/10 Haunted - Amy Lee sang the heck out of this one, and because of it, it's great. It's not quite at bloody as Tourniquet, but creepy all the same, and in this reviewer's eyes, creepy = good. 10/10    Touniquet- This song really makes you brood over death. Amy really convinces you that she's in serious pain when she sings so soulfully, and it makes you so sorry for her, that you just can't help but like the song. However, I'm not really one for the morbid-type, so marks down for the gruesome details. Don't get me wrong though; this song is still great. 9/10    Imaginary - Amy describes how she retreats into her own world to escape the horrors of this one, but she can't decide which one she likes better. Very soulful, just like all of the other songs on the album, and one of my personal favorites. 10/10    Taking Over Me - It seems like Amy is willing to drop everything and find her true love, who has taken over her soul and now is morunful for him because he left. The lyrics are great, and the entire song has a very catchy beat. 9.5/10 Hello - This is the song that got me hooked on Evanescence. Haunting and beautiful lyrics, Amy's beautiful voice that will keep you awake (and slightly insane because of sadness and other factors) for weeks to come, and absolutely haunting melody on the piano, this is my personal favorite song on this album. It maintains the sad note of Haunted and Tourniquet, but with much less violence. She doesn't know if she's sleeping or not, and then she realizes that death really does exist, and that nothing will ever be the same. Let me scream for a moment: I LOVE THIS SONG!! 10/10    My Last Breath - When I listened to this, the first time, I got the lyrics stuck in my head because Amy sung them so beautifully! The beat is catchy and fun, and the lyrics are great. Overall, a great song. 9.5/10    Whisper - This song is probably the worst one on the CD, though don't get me wrong; I stilllove it, but it just isn't up to par with the others. I do, however, love the Latin at the end; Amy translated it roughly to &amp;amp;amp;quot;Save us from danger, save us from evil,&amp;amp;amp;quot; and it really fits the mood of the song. It gets pretty slow at the end, so that turned me off of it a little bit. Still a good song nonetheless. 8.5/10    Overall, this album is one of the most polished I've ever heard in years, and it really got me hooked on the goth/rocky genre. I simply can't wait for the next one! Keep up the good work guys!
B0002VKZL6|5.0|I get a real positive vibe from this album.  It makes you feel good to be alive and free.  The artwork on the inside of the cd case features a beautiful beach scene with dolphins, seagulls, and happy people.  And that's just how the music makes you feel - like you are sitting on a chair at the beach with an ice cold Corona.  The lyrics are unbelievably well-developed and thoughtful.  It is yet another work of genius from the legendary Mark Knopfler.
B000268QB2|5.0|First off, This is a great debut, from some very talented artists. If there are comparisons to be made, (and by the other reviews I have read we all have an opinion) I would say that the songwriting on this album reminds me a lot of \\"Queen.\\" <br />However to compare this band to any other band would be a terrible injustice to this great new album (CD?). I purchased this recording based on the opening track and I was not dissapointed. Great melodies ! (unheard of these days) and fine vocal & musical talent, set this band apart from many others. <br />I hope they don't tinker with thier sound and continue to produce a lasting body of work that pleases the music lovers of the world for many years to come. Cheers!
0385336810|5.0|I loved, loved, loved this book! Sophie Kinsella first captivated me with her Shopaholic series, and \\"Can You Keep A Secret\\" has done it again! I read it in two evenings flat, just couldn't put it down last night.<br /><br />Emma is your average 20-something, trying to make it in marketing. She has an evil cousin who always makes fun of her for not being as successful as she has been. Then something changes. Emma has a \\"near death experience\\" when flying on a business trip. She spills all her deepest, darkest secrets to the mystery man next to her--intimate things including the fact that her boyfriend doesn't satisfy her (even though all her friends seem to think they are the perfect couple). All is fine until Emma walks into work, hearing whispers that Jack, the President of the company will be visiting...you guessed it--Jack is the mystery man from the plane!!!<br /><br />I absolutely loved the charisma between the Jack and Emma. From all that she told him, he knows EXACTLY how to get to her, to rile her up. The book gave me quite a few laughs! A wonderful read, definitely don't pass this one up!
B00003CXC7|5.0|I know, it's a much over-used term, but in this case it's the truth. I first saw this film in a Cinema class as an undergraduate, and a good half-dozen times since, and it still holds up well. <br /> <br />It is one of the purest pieces of cinema ever created- Hitchcock is  amaster at telling the story through the camera lense (something directors often don't do!)  <br /> <br />It works as a mysterey, it works as cinemographic art, it works because Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly are fine people to have in your living room- if only on the TV screen.
0345457684|4.0|This probably is the first cyberpunk novel that is actually entertaining.  In this future world, human conscious is digitized and stored in a small tubular device called a cortical stack, implanted under a brain stem.  Thus when one is dead, one's conscious, together with the memory can be downloaded to other available human body called a sleeve.  Takeshi Kovacs, the main character of this book, is an ex-Envoy, a trained super soldier, sort of a Jedi with emphasis on the dark side.  He is downloaded to the Earth as a private detective to solve a murder case.  The client is the victim himself, who has revived by being resleeved to a clone body.  The plot itself is not very complicated.  In fact, it follows a typical violent B-movie formula; stereotypical characters - an ex-cop turned detective, a bored wife of a rich man, a stereotypical storyline - an ex-cop turned detective falls for a bored wife of a rich man, and an erratic plot with a lot of unnecessary twists.  There are bits and pieces of Gibson, \\"Matrix\\"and \\"Ghost in the Shell\\"  Not many original ideas, but no over-detailed bore typical in cyberpunk novels either.  How can this be not entertaining!
0451191153|3.0|I've hesitated to write a review about this book - when I first read it I was enamoured and thought it was one of the greatest fiction works ever. Since then I read it five more times, and the first few times I enjoyed it nearly as much, but after that the veneer wore off.     This is not because it is shallow as some claim, (i can read Wodehouse over and over) or because it is bad writing, but I think because her premises are just wrong.    I still think this is a good book about a creative person's struggle, and a refreshing counter to socialism, but as I have gotten older, better read, I find her ideas as destrucitve as the collectivism she purports to have hated.     And you really can't discuss this book without discussing her ideas, as the philosophy plays a central role to the plot.  In reading her further, I found her radical atheism and indifferance to nature disturbing and as destructive as collectivism (as her discples are proving to be)     There are some interesting, exciting parts- and her descriptions of how bad art becomes popular are probably uncannily correct.     If there is one thing to take away from this book it is the determination of an architect (howard roark)  to not comprimise his principles and creative vision. Those who would believe such a character unrealistic only need to read Ayn Rand's real life story of getting this book published.
B00005JNEI|5.0|I have been a fan of Michael Moore for a few years now and let me tell you...this country needs more people out there doing as he does so that we are not taken advantage of by those at the top, including our dear beloved president. Moore does nothing but make us question people that we would not normally think we need to. I am not a supporter of Bush, but even if I was I would have seen this movie. It is directed and put together beautifully. Do your country a favor, watch this, vote, and remember not to always believe that those on top are on your side, because chances are they're not. It sucks that I live in a country run by him, and a state controlled by his brother.
0887306101|5.0|\\"Market Wizards\\" is a book that I think traders ought to read and reread. The interviews offer a window into the way great traders think and act. To me, reading top trader interviews from \\"Market Wizards\\" over and over (and I do) is like a basketball player visualizing making free throws before the game starts. It reminds me of the proper mindset and discipline needed to trade successfully.  <br /> <br />Plus, the stories are fantastic. Almost every trader interviewed has a \\"here's the trade that almost put me out of business\\" story. They're terrific for me to read because they teach me two things: first, that the market is utterly unforgiving and ever-changing, and even great traders can get their lights put out if they aren't disciplined; and, second, that life (and trading) is about persistence and learning from misteaks (get it?).  <br /> <br />Buy it and enjoy it  -  be sure not to miss the story Paul Tudor Jones tells about getting caught on the wrong side of a cotton trade, and realizing it the very instant he entered into the trade. Terrific.
B000002KD9|3.0|My feeling on Neil Young is that he is quite an accomplished songwriter.  Tunes like Only Love Can Break Your Heart, Cripple Creek Ferry, Don't Let It Bring You Down, and a few others are quite captivating both musically and lyrically.  There are some good guitar and piano passages throughout the record as well.<br /><br />However, the bringdown is Neil's voice.  The title track is quite beautiful...that is except for the off tone vocals of Mr. Young.  Southern Man and When You Dance are captivating rockers.  However, Neil's harsh whinny vocals do annoy me rather than please me.  The harmonies by Crazy horse and any guest musicians help somewhat.  However, when the lead voice is a liability, the entire project suffers as a whole.<br /><br />Therefore a three star rating seems fair.  I would seek out Harvest instead of this as Neil's vocals on that CD are a bit more listenable.
B00005V1B2|5.0|This 1975 release is a fantastic album of synth heavy and soft instrumental music that saw Camel moving on from the harder rocking Mirage (1974) to create a more contemplative album.  In fact, I personally feel that Camel reached an artistic and creative peak with The Snow Goose suite.<br /><br />The musicians on this album comprise the \\"classic\\" Camel lineup and include Andrew Latimer (electric, acoustic, and slide guitars, flute, and (wordless) vocals); Pete Bardens (Hammond organ, electric piano, acoustic piano, pipe organ, mini-moog, ARP Odyssey, and (wordless) vocals); Doug Ferguson (electric bass); and Andy Ward (drums, vibes, and percussion).  All of the musicians are very good but I feel compelled to single Andy Latimer out as an excellent guitar player - he has a very colorful style and utilizes a number of different tones and timbres on a range of instruments.  With respect to the vocal department, The Snow Goose suite is largely instrumental although there are a few short passages that feature vocal harmonies (no lyrics).  According to the liner notes, the decision to produce an instrumental album caused the record company some concern.<br /><br />In addition to the core musicians an orchestra is used on The Snow Goose, which was directed by David Bedford.  If I am not mistaken, I think this is the same David Bedford that released albums such as Star's End (1974) and worked with rock musicians including Mike Oldfield and Kevin Ayers etc.<br /><br />Overall, the sound on this album is very soft and at times haunting and deeply reflective.  In general, the Snow Goose suite alternates slightly heavier sections with delicate passages that feature acoustic instruments, clean-sounding guitar, and warm-toned synthesizers.  I guess it's worth noting that the heavier sections are really not heavy at all, but just feature the full band.  Stylistically, this album is classic progressive rock although there are subtle undertones of jazz-rock too.  The brief orchestral passages are also very nice and add yet another textural property to the recording.<br /><br />This remastered CD is pretty good and features restored artwork, a ton of band photos, and extensive liner notes.  There are five bonus tracks including a series of singles and live versions of Rhayader Goes to Town and The Snow Goose/Freefall (from the Mirage album).  Both of the live tracks were taken from an October 30, 1974 concert and feature decent sound quality.  The performances are also quite good too.<br /><br />The Snow Goose is highly recommended along with the excellent Rain Dances (1977), which features Richard Sinclair on bass and lead vocals.orchestral passages are also very nice and add yet another textural property to the recording.   <br /> <br />This remastered CD is pretty good and features restored artwork, a ton of band photos, and extensive liner notes.

B00003CXCT|2.0|I've wanted these films since I first bought a DVD player, and now that they're here on DVD, it's as if I've reached a highly anticipated anti-climax. For these films are not the films I wanted, they aren't even the 'special' editions.    I'm not going to launch into a tirade against Lucas, there's enough of that to go around - I just want people to know what they're buying. Several changes have been made to the films, including re-recording the dialog of Boba Fett, and to add insult to injury, the spirit line-up at the end of 'Return of the Jedi' has been altered with Hayden Christensen replacing the original Sebastian Shaw (RIP) Anakin apparition. This on top of the already atrocious revised ending.    To their credit, the picture quality is marvellous, and the extra features many. The commentary from Lucas is worth a listen, and the `Empire of Dreams' documentary well produced. But where are the fabled deleted scenes? I know they exist, I've seen one of them. I'm saving my money for the original trilogy.    Sorry Mr Lucas, no sale.
1401301010|5.0|Red Hot Chili Pepper front man and rock & Roll bad boy Anthony Kiedis shows that he's not just a pretty face in his recent biography, Scar Tissue.  Get yourself fully loaded with snacks and supplies and prepare to sit for quite a while, because you won't want to stop turning pages.  It is a well written, detailed account of his ascent into stardom paralleled with his descent into drug addiction.    Mr. Kiedis paints a picture of loneliness and self destruction on almost every page. Tales of living homeless and scrounging for \\"the 800 pound gorilla\\" make the reader aware that his own lot in life just ain't so bad after all.  Reflections of his sexual exploits are documented with honor and grace.  All of the women he has been with are described as \\"the most beautiful woman in the world\\" and as having \\"the best sex ever\\". One gets the feeling that the Red Hot Man can truly love every woman on the planet.     The lesson learned here is not the old battle cry, \\"sex drugs `n' rock & roll\\" but Love (for his fans), Peace (between his band mates) and of course,  Rock and Roll...because in the end it's just about the music.  One of my favorites to be read again...
B000001EXR|3.0|Carnival of Souls isn't bad, but the album moves at such a plodding pace that it feels like it's 3 hours long. No one's gonna mistake it for light fare ala Dynasty or Crazy Nights...in fact, it's probably Kiss' heaviest studio album to date. Which in theory I suppose is a good thing, but most songs feel like they're either idling or stuck in first gear. For an album so heavy, it sure is laid-back sounding at the same time. Even the quick-tempoed songs move kinda...slow. But there ARE some good tunes on here, most notably the hypnotic \\"Jungle\\"...Kiss comes dangerously close to sounding psychedelic (gasp!) on this song, but there's no denying its catchy groove. Bruce Kulick & Eric Singer pretty much carry the album musically, and it woulda been interesting to have heard Kulick with this much input & reign on his other Kiss efforts. He definitely makes the most of the situation, and without him this album coulda suffered greatly...and this is coming from an Ace Frehley fan, but hey, you gotta give credit where it's due. All in all, Carnival of Souls is a pretty good album, but honestly there's probably few (if any) toe-tapping tracks on here that'd make it onto a Kiss party-mix compilation.
0375432302|5.0|This is a very enjoyable book.  I agree with the other reviewer that this is not a history lesson - but a story that is very entertaining with a great plot.  It does make you think far outside the the book - which is what reading is supposed to do.  Robert Langdon may be too perfect - but this is fiction ;)  I have already purchased \\"Angels and Demons\\" and am reading through it furiously.
B00003CXBH|5.0|I love this movie. I'm sure Roger Ebert has his points, even he liked the cinematography though. He should, maybe it's second only to Lawrence of Arabia. There's a scene of clergymen canoeing into a village on a sun sparkling river to a lively joyous music in the background that just lifts you out of yourself with it's exhilaration. <br />  Jeremy Irons is so good as the Jesuit priest explaining to Deniro they don't kill because Christ is love and mercy... <br /> I thought he did that beautifully, and then the scene where Deniro dies as he's seeing Irons walking onto the battlefield holding the cross and leading the villagers to martyrdom and massacre... I mean, these scenes stay with you all your life and change you. <br />  Deniro laughing and crying at the same time because he's finally found peace in the hands of the Jesuits is the sweetest most tender thing I think I've ever seen. This is art. This is why people make and watch movies my friend.  <br />  I will never forget this movie. I always tell people to check it out. Check this out!
B00003CXUM|1.0|I'm generally a fan of art-house films... But honestly, this movie was just really boring. Many of the scenes are like 10 minutes long where the camera just pans back and forth with little dialogue.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Fortunate enough to have grown up going to the CBGB's harcore matinee every Sunday throughout the eighties (when the punk music scene was thriving), I've always rejected \\"corporate punk\\" bands like Green Day... thinking that they lacked conviction, depth, sincerity etc.  After all, why not just listen to The Ramones when you feel like rocking without thinking too much?    Anyway, I read the Rolling Stone review of this *album* on CD (I'm choosing my words carefully here)in which they compared it to The Who's Tommy and Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon and decided to give it a chance... how glad I am that I did.  To put it plainly, this album is the greatest recording since Wilco's Yankee Hotel Foxtrot (another great album on CD)  The songwriting is stellar (except for maybe \\"Are we the waiting\\" and \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\")... and the music does everything from breathlessly rocking-out on \\"St. Jimmy\\" to evoking a sad sigh and bringing a tear to the eye when listening to the haunting \\"Wake me up when September ends\\" (incidentally track #11, just in case you don't get the reference).  The sampling and tempo changes are eclectic and the layering is sophisticated- definitely the furthest you could push punk rock without losing the ferocity and the sincerity.  Great album.  So great, in fact, that it inspired me to write my first review...
6304539258|5.0|I saw the original \\"Star Wars\\" (you can keep calling it \\"Episode IV: A New Hope\\" all you want, I do not have to go along with it) in a theater far and away more times than any other movie (low double figures).  I saw \\"Star Wars\\" as much as the films I saw the second and third most often in a movie theater, which would be, of course, \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" and \\"The Return of the Jedi.\\"  I even sat through the movie twice in a row, the first time so I could pay attention to everything that happened in the lower left quadrant of the film and the second time so I could watch the lower right quadrant.<br /><br />Watch the film again for the first time in several years three things stuck out in my mind as to why this film got us so excited way back when.  The first, as noted above, was how there was so to look at in this film.  Nobody ever laughed at the alien in the sunglasses trailing after the good guys at Mois Eisley, but in addition to the all the weird looking aliens in the Cantina and throughout the film there was the way this galaxy far, far away looked like it had been lived in.  The idea that the Millenium Falcon is not only the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy but actually looks like a hunk of junk mattered.  Even the wacky white armor of the Storm Troopers meant something to us, even if we questioned its functionality.  You could reduce Han Solo to his grin, Princess Leia to her hairdo, and Luke Skywalker to his light saber, because the costumes and art design were things we had never seen before.  Of course, Darth Vader being able to think people to death was pretty impressive.<br /><br />The second is that if there is any one thing that made \\"Star Wars\\" move than a \\"B\\" movie made with an \\"A\\" budget it is the musical score by John Williams.  The composer had won his first Oscar two years earlier for \\"Jaws\\" and was also nominated for \\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\\" when he won again for \\"Star Wars.\\"  One of the things we did because we could not go and sit in the theater watching \\"Star Wars\\" all day was to listen to the double-album for the movie's soundtrack (yes, I probably listened to this soundtrack more than any other in history than did not require singing \\"The Time Warp\\" or any other song).  I do not know how much of the movie is scored to music, but it has to be an extremely high percentage, albeit short of what you would get with a silent film.  The only movie score that I find comparable is the one Ennio Morricone did for \\"Once Upon a Time in the West,\\" especially in terms of have motifs associated with characters.<br /><br />The final thing that made this movie great was the entire final sequence where the Rebels attack the Death Star.  The X-Wing fighters are still the coolest I have ever seen, despite what we have seen from \\"Battlestar Galactica\\" to \\"Farscape\\" and everything in between.  I would really love to see the complete original template George Lucas put together for the special effects crew spliced together from World War II movies.  Not only do we have the drama of the \\"Dam Busters\\" runs on the Death Star, but the sequences provides a number of memorable characters, most of whose names we never learn: Red Leader (Drewe Henley), Red Two (Dennis Lawson), Red Four (Jack Klaff), Red Six (William Hootkins), Gold Leader (Angus Mcinnis), Gold Two (Jeremy Sinden), and Gold Five (Graham Ashley).  Everything that happened was so vivid that when listening to the lengthy \\"Battle of Yavin\\" cut on the soundtrack I swear we could recreate every shot in our minds.<br /><br />Perhaps the best way of describing the impact of \\"Star Wars\\" is to say that it must have been similar to what happened a generation or two earlier when Dorothy opened the door to Oz and the screen went from sepia tones to Technicolor.  It was an introduction to a whole new world.  Even if we never saw a Saturday morning serial we could appreciate the idea of a roller coaster type of ride where Sand People attack, the Millenium Falconhas to escape the Death Star, and the Rebel base is almost within range.<br /><br />In terms of the controversy over the way George Lucas has tinkered with his 1977 film, I have already bought into the idea of the director's cut, so it is hard to fault the director for having a slightly different definition of that from others.  I remember how outdated the special effects looked three years later when \\"Empire\\" came out, so updating them makes sense to me.  The scene with Jabba sets up what happens in the rest of the original trilogy and I think the scene with Biggs before the attack is important simply because I think the idea that the last person killed is Luke's best friend.  Besides, I have the film we saw in 1977 preserved in a letterboxed edition on laser disc and can still watch it whenever I want.<br /><br />Actually, what surprised me the most with this \\"final\\" version of the original \\"Star Wars\\" movie was how tacky the attempts by Lucas to retroactively fix his character's flaws.  To be clear that Han Solo is not a cold blooded killer Greedo now shoots first, although he is an incredible bad shot, especially from four feet away.  Then there was the shock that Leia no long kisses Luke on the lips \\"For luck\\" before they swing across that chasm.  Now it is a chaste little peck on the cheek.  It will be interesting to see what Lucas does with that early scene in \\"The Empire Strikes Back,\\" but I wlll find out about that tomorrow.nium Falcon has to escape the Death Star, and the Rebel base is almost within range. <br /> <br />In terms of the controversy over the way George Lucas has tinkered with his 1977 film, I have already bought into the idea of the director's cut, so it is hard to fault the director for having a slightly different definition of that from others.

B000002KP3|5.0|I had been listening to The Beatles and Led Zep as a ten year old due to my older brothers record collection,but this is the album that got me hooked on music.The combination of cool rock and mysticism just blew my young mind away!This record made me feel sexy before I even new what sex was! I dont bellieve that there is another album that sounds quite like this one, and it probably ranks as the bands best.No other act has quite been able to capture the T.Rex/Marc Bolan sound and listening to this album, it is easy to see why.It deserves to be ranked with the best classic rock releases of the early 70s and has stood the test of time, thanks to Bolans amazing songs and Tony Viscontis production skills.An album to indulge your senses!
1400031362|5.0|The books in this wonderful series just keep getting better and better, and this latest, which finds the formidable secretary Mma Makutsi promoted to assistant manager of Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni's auto repair shop, often had me laughing aloud.<br /><br />In a tale whose loose ends wind up in the most unexpected and delightful of ways, our heroine and owner of the Ladies Number One Detective Agency, Mma Ramotswe, has her hands full. Her fiance, the above-mentioned Mr. Matekoni, is suffering from a mysterious malaise, and has started to neglect his thriving business. Her own detective agency, while still getting customers, is showing no profit and may have to move into different premises. Put that together with the lazy, girl-chasing auto-repair apprentices, the earnest and ambitious Mma Makutsi, and a case for the detective agency that just might save the business, and there are plot twists aplenty.<br /><br />Of course, Mma Ramotswe faces all her problems unscathed, after many cups of bush tea. And of course Mma Makutsi proves herself to be invaluable--as usual.<br /><br />A delightful tale in this utterly delightful series!
B0000AGQ6Z|5.0|It was called the first \\"thinking man's epic\\" and to this day, can probably still hold that claim.  Probably because, it wasn't afraid to be nearly 4hrs long (before miniseries or BBC serials), because Robert Bolt (of \\"Man for All Seasons\\" fame) did a literate script adaptation, and of course, because of the glorious cinematography, editing, soundtrack, and competent acting.  I saw a gorgeous restored print (the grain was like silk) with full soundtrack,and if I can't do that again, this DVD will do.  But to understand Lawrence, and his motivation, DON'T trust the film completely. It is VERY close, but not completely accurate.  Read \\"Seven Pillars...\\" to know how he really felt about rescuing Gazim, or having to shoot someone to end a fued before it started, or the final scenes in the Damascus hospital.  Lawrence was not a meglomaniac or even an egomaniac.  He was a masochist, extremely intelligent, and made sure he had great physical endurance.  And as Lowell Thomas so perfectly noted, [he] also had \\"a genuius for backing into the limelight.\\"  But he used publicity to help others (the Heshemite Arabs, British authors, Churchill, the future RAF) and only sometimes himself. Or why did he avoid it so obsessively the rest of his life? And for all those who don't believe Deraa, read the chapter in \\"The Mint\\" where he gets a physical.  If the actual records agree with that, then I do not think there is a reason to disbelieve...as Lean himself noted, Lawrence 's descriptions were so accurate, the filmmakers found the exact places he had been in Wadi Ruumm 60 years before.  This despite, shifting sands and politics in the intervening years! <br />So definately view and keep this film.  But also read Lawrence's letters, Seven Pillars..., and The Mint.  Wilson's bio is probably the best.  Peck is good for a psychoanalysis.  And Cave also did good documentary work. But the original is best.
B000092ZYX|5.0|radiohead is by far the best band since the beatles. others have tried to be as good as Radiohead, but they dont come close,Coldplay is pretty close tho. But Hail To The Thief broke some barriers to make it their real sound, im just anxious of what their 7th CD will sound like. this is kinda of a mix of all of their cds combined. Electronic Rock and Roll at the best.  <br />2+2=5--Sit Down Stand Up--Sail To The Moon--Go To Sleep--Where I End And You Begin--The Gloaming--There There are my favorites on it even though all of them really stand out as amazing art from Radiohead. Jonny Greenwood's guitar is amazing as usual and his beats are crazzzy.Thom Yorke's voice is amazing as always, great spooky lyrics on this disc. Overall this CD is a must have!! I WILL EAT YOU ALIVE
B0002OERI0|5.0|I Have been a Die Hard Green fan of Green Day since my sister (when i was at the tender age of 8), introduced me to Green Day in 1992. I might be the only Green Day Fan who thinks this, but every album they ever released, out did the other. Dookie was Great, Insominac was Awesome, Nimrod Had some of my Favorite songs ever Written on there, Warning was by far, up to that point, there best \\"Album\\". I felt they started to experiemnt and was working. When i actually heard that this album was getting Rave reviews, i knew it had to be something special. I was wrong, It might be the best album i have ever owned. And Green Day, being my second favorite band ever (behind Pearl Jam), proved that they can mature and excel even beoynd my Expectations. As most Fans Agree, American idiot might be there worst Song of the album, and its a Great song! I Can't even single out a individule song becuase the whole Album Compliments itself. If i had to break it apart, i would say, \\"Boulvard of Broken Dreams\\", \\"St. Jimmy\\" and \\"Wake Me Up When September ends\\" will be reguarded as the Classics and most memorable songs on the album. However, just about every song can easily replace those three. i give this Album its highest recomantation, and save, \\"London Calling\\" by The Class, this might be the best, \\"Punk\\" Album ever made. Even though there are parts of it that are not very punk at all. 5 out of 5
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|As a teacher of Classical Greek and Roman Mythology I was looking forward to \\"Troy.\\"  In the past I have put together a unit on the Trojan War that included not only Homer's epic poem the \\"Iliad,\\" but also the plays of Euripides and Aeschylus and other ancient works on the stories of these characters. In other words I am familiar with this story to the extent that when Briseis showed up wearing a garment with long sleeves I was upset that we did not get to see the lovely arms that were part  of her usual epithet. So, suffice it to say, that when characters who survived the Trojan War started dying in this film, I was not exactly happy. Consequently, the truth is that the less you know about the Trojan War of classical mythology, the more you will enjoy Wolfgang Petersen's \\"Troy.\\"<br /><br />I have no problem with the idea that Homer and the other ancients have to be adapted in making a modern motion picture about the Trojan War. The decision to eliminate the gods is appropriate, getting away from the idea that this was a ten year war makes sense, and if the alliance of the Greeks is now political rather than as part of an oath sworn by the princes who were suitors for Helen's hand, I consider that to be legitimate. I do not understand why Iphigenia, Cassandra, and Hecuba are all eliminated but there are not fatal omissions. But when you start rewriting who gets killed that is going a bit too far, especially when one premature death starts a chain effect that means Athens will never develop the jury system, which means we probably lose out on it too. David Benioff's screenplay was \\"inspired\\" by Homer's \\"Iliad,\\" which at least is an honest way to characterize what he did in this script, but I still do not have to like it or endorse it.<br /><br />The big selling point for this film was not Homer but rather Brad Pitt as Achilles. Stories abound about how Pitt worked six months to get in shape for this film, gave up smoking, and ended up hurting his Achilles tendon in one of those profound ironies that indicates that maybe the gods were not pleased with what was happening in this film. Pitt certainly looks good, not just in terms of taking several opportunities to display the line of his nude body, but in how he carries himself as Achilles. The whole idea is that this guy is the greatest warrior on the face of the planet and Pitt exudes that with the way he strides across the sands of Troy. Even more impressive is the choreography for the fights, because Pitt's movements are so smooth and powerful, especially compared with that of Eric Bana's Hector, that you do not doubt that this guy is in a league by himself as a warrior. I also like the way he uses the distinctive form of his shield when fighting.  They thought this part out quite a bit.<br /><br />The fight choreography was worked out by Simon Crane, the film's stunt coordinator and second unit director, who describes Achilles as fighting with a boxing style but with the velocity of a speed skater and the agility of a panther. They also come up with a nice touch in that Achilles looks slightly to the side at his opponent until he is ready to come in for the kill. The best fight sequences of \\"Troy\\" are when Achilles is fighting. The giant battle sequences of computerized soldiers are not as impressive, mainly because the camera is always in motion and the cutting is so fast that we are left with an impression of the battle rather than always being able to tell what is going on (which has become my constant complaint with most movies with large battle sequences).<br /><br />Bana does a good job of capturing Hector's nobility without turning him into a marble statue, while Peter O'Toole fills the role of Priam naturally. On the Trojan side the problematic character is Paris (Orlando Bloom), again because of the writing more than the performance. Priam has negotiated peace between Troy and the Sparta of King Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson), but that is destroyed when Paris persuades Helen (Diane Kruger) to run away with him. Both Hector and Priam know that Paris is wrong and their reasons for supporting him and thereby dooming Troy ring hollow (the less than stellar \\"Helen of Troy\\" television miniseries did a nice job of providing a solid motivation for the Trojans to protect Helen).<br /><br />It you want to draw a clear distinction between Homer's story of Achilles and that of Benioff it is that the former is about the rage of Achilles (see the first line of the \\"Iliad\\") and the latter adds an equally strong love element. The one character whose role is most inflated in this version is that of Briseis (Rose Byrne), the Trojan slave girl who comes between Achilles and Agamemnon (Brian Cox), the king of kings for the Greeks. This change becomes the reasoning behind how the film rewrites the end game of the Trojan War, although I still do not understand why some of the key characters get to live happily ever after. But since Pitt's performance dominates the film and he is clearly the horse that director Wolfgang Petersen is riding to make the whole thing work, it makes sense that he has to be around until the very end.<br /><br />The good news is that when I teach mythology after this DVD comes out my students will probably enjoy attacking Benioff's changes in the original stories of Greek mythology in their papers. I think this will definitely help them understand why the writings of Homer and the other ancients are considered classics.rsuades Helen (Diane Kruger) to run away with him.

B000002H97|3.0|IMO, there are two areas where this album falters compared to their masterpieces like MOP and Ride the Lightning: <br />a. Attitude/power. Only a few songs here have the punch of songs like For Whom the Bell Tolls or Disposable Heroes. I know attitude and edge aren't everything, but they were a key part of all previous releases. I'm all for maturation as long as it doesn't make the music dull; unfortunately, dull is the word to describe many songs on this album. <br />b. Overall feel. Every prior album had a distinct feel/mood to it: Kill had a raw aggression, Ride had a joyous grandeur, Master had an angry edge, and Justice was dark and gloomy. The black album has none of this, as crazy aggressive songs like Holier than Thou are followed by slow, moody ones like My Friend of Misery in a nearly random fashion. While the older ones had differently paced songs, they always fit the album's general mood, which is not the case here. Even the hated Loads and St. Anger do a better job creating a general mood than this album does, if you ask me; this scattershot feel hurts the album even more than the lack of power and aggression. <br /> In spite of these glaring problems, the s/t does have some very good moments. Sad but True has a monstrous, unforgettable riff that combines with excellent lyrics and a great solo to create a vintage Metallica song. Through the Never and Wherever I May Roam sound more mature without losing the classic feel, with calmer lyrics backed up by good riffs and great solo. The Unforgiven's entrapment lyrics are cheesy compared with the similarly themed Dyers Eve from Justice, but the riff and melodies are excellent and the song is good overall. And although the solo and orchestral stuff in Nothing Else Matters feel very silly to me, the melody is strong and it does have alot of heart and feeling. However, the songs besides these ones have little emotional content and/or good hooks to latch on to, and the riffs aren't strong enough to overcome thisproblem except for Enter Sandman, which is a fun song despite the goofy lyrics. The God That Failed is decent, with ok lyrics/riff and a cool solo. However, Don't Tread on Me is flat-out terrible, Struggle Within and Of Wolf and Man is similarly bland, Holier than Thou is fast and aggressive but still isn't really good, and My Friend of Misery has a great bass intro but dissolves with a bad riff and bland lyrics. Good as half of the album is, the other half is so lousy at times that 3 stars is all I can justify.
B00008WG3U|4.0|As the title conveys, NOFX takes a stab at politically fueled lyrics, speaking out on the media, George W's policies and a variety of post 9/11 topics. NOFX seems to be speaking to the punk rock community here, suggesting that we form our own community in a stance against our governments actions, and the media's lies and propaganda, creating consciousness in the young punk rock world. Fat Mike doesn't push his practices on America's youth as much as he just lays out the facts as he sees them to be. Fat Mike attacks the media several times, pointing out the fear they inject into America on a daily basis. Fat Mike makes his views clear, concise and easy to understand in a world that makes these issues so hard to swallow, let alone understand. Some first rate politically inspired tracks include \\"The Irrationality of Rationality\\", \\"Franco Un-American\\", \\"Idiots Are Taking Over\\", and \\"American Errorist (I Hate Hate Haters)\\".<br /><br />NOFX does tackle other subjects on the album besides politics. \\"She's Nubs\\" is a hilarious song about a handicapped fan. \\"Medio-core\\" rips on rock & roll's ongoing regurgitation. Some of the tracks don't fit in the theme of \\"The War On Errorism\\", but they are a welcomed break in action from the seriousness on the politically fueled lyrics.<br /><br />For the most part, this is NOFX at their best. Fans should not be disappointed with this one. Bush lovers may, but not the true fans.
B00003CXCT|4.0|I thought maybe I just had a bad copy of the Star Wars movies, but I have been reading on other web sites other people are seeing the same problems.  <br /> <br />There are a few battle scenes where fighter ships are shot at and blown up, but the explosion sounds are missing. There are places in the movies where the speakers sounds are reversed. Overall they are still great movies, but I suspect there are enough noticeable problems that there is going to be a recall of the DVDs.
B00003CXCT|1.0|My complaint regarding this boxed set has nothing to do with the picture quality, sound, or remastered special effects in the films. It has to do with the harsh reality that the Star Wars films that I loved growing up have been forever changed, and I am afraid that most of these changes are not for the better. To begin, the 1997 special edition scene in A New Hope where Han Solo steps on Jabba's tail is out of place and it does not belong in the film. Perhaps a 3-year old would find a scene like this to be funny, but it does not play well for mature audiences.The scene in the Empire Strikes Back with the new Palpatine is rather strange because the pacing of the acting seems to be off (why does the Emperor pause in between his lines?) It appears that Mr. Lucas has sacrificed the charm of his Star Wars movies for special effects. As a purist who likes to see movies PRESERVED for future generations instead of tampered with, I feel that Mr. Lucas has done a disservice to Star Wars fans and movie fans alike. As the buffoon Jar Jar Binks would say...Mesa thinks these changes bombad!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Joss Whedon's shows are normally very good but Firefly is a standout even among Buffy and Angel. The show is fast paced, witty, and emotionally touching. It's a shame it's off the air, to watch this series is to understand that there was so much left to explain.
B0002JJBZE|5.0|I have to disagree with M. Montanez review below...  The casing is awesome.  It's thick and durable and well designed.  It opens from the top with a hinge on the bottom.  The DVD's are in a separate plastic cd holder inside in book format that lets you flip through them easily and quickly to select the discs you want to watch.  The video quality on these is crisp and clear and the sound is awesome... Dolby 5.1 folks!!!  The bass booms, the red alert comes out of the back speakers, echoes and aliens are thrown to various speakers.  Explosions and ship combat is like you've never heard before. :)  If you love the old series, you will come to love it more with the remastered video, sound, and music.  Why is the casing yellow for the first season?  Because the Star Trek titles were yellow during season one.  The season two casing is blue because the star trek titles were blue in season two. Not sure about red yet for season three, but just a pick since season three was in blue titles also.  The set comes with a pamphlet outlining each episode and some other paragraphs containing history and encyclopedic information about the Star Trek universe.  The extras are great too!   <br /> <br />I consider this to be an exceptional and quality set! Very, very pleased. It was far superior than I expected.  And I shopped around for the lowest price.  Amazon.com had it! <br /> <br />
B00000DGUY|5.0|Well im not a big fan of Dire Straits... Just wanted to know the real score about the band.When I was still in the elementary grades, if im not mistaken.. Grade Three.

So I asked him... what on earth are u singin...told me its a Dire Straits song...Well ok.. But i didnt buy \\"Brothers In Arms\\"..So the years went by and I heard another single, this time its my boss who is playing it..\\"So Far Away\\" was the title.. <br />told him that its a boring song...

B000002J09|5.0|Well what can anyone say about Zeppelin? it's the toughest thing anyone can possibly be made to answer.  Maybe it's wise to start with the other great human endeavours, the Ancient Greeks,  the Pyramids, The European Rennaisance, Beethoven, Einstein. Put these in a melting pot and the end result would stll be vastly inferior to the worst song by Zeppelin. In fact it's false to think of Zeppelin as having a worst song. How dare I. HOW DARE I. Every Zeppelin song is the azimuth of human genius.The human mind is simply unable to comprehend the dizzying magnitude of Zeppelins genius. It's like trying to comprehend the vastness of the Cosmos. It can't be done. Just trying to comprehend the tiniest fragment of Zeppelins talent would drive the strongest man mad. In all truth I feel dirty when listening to Zeppelin. These three (RIP John Bonham) wonderful, wonderful men are humble enough to share the same planet with us, and do so without complaining. Every single man woman and child on the planet must do 60 years of penance for failing to be in  the same league as the four members of Led Zeppelin. We are but sinful WORMS in thy prescence O Zeppelin.I saw Zeppelin on stage in 1973 and the entire audinece was disappointed that Our Lord did not appear behind John Bonhams drum kit. It should have happened, but Our Lord in His wisdom obviously chose his Second Coming for later Zeppelin reunion tours. Jimmy Page  is someone whom I've always personally admired, perhaps more deeply, more strongly, more abjectly than ever before. A man, well more than a man, a god , a great god, whose personality is so totally and utterly wonderful my feeble words of welcome sound wretchedly and pathetically inadequate. Someone whose boots I would gladly lick clean until holes wore through my tongue, a man who is so totally and utterly wonderful, that I would rather be sealed in a pit of my own filth, than dare be in on the same room with him. Buy this album.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|It depresses me when people are unable to take a film for what it truly is, when people want to pervert it into the crap that is modern film. By far, the most common complaint about this film is that it is \\"too slow\\" or it \\"has no plot.\\" Grow up. Go watch Fellini's La Strada and tell people that \\"it sucks because it has no plot.\\" Film is not about plot. It is not about special effects or the thrill that shoots up your spine when Darth Vader cuts off the hand of his own son. It is about capturing the beauty and reality of life through a medium. The same is true with literature. Authors and Film-makers are attempting to tell us something, to show us something about the value inherent in daily life. But sadly, we have deviated very far from this vision. It seems that all contemporary audiences desire is a cheap thrill. Lost in Translation does not even make an attempt at elliciting that thrill. Instead, it attempts to give us an unbiased look into the lives of two ordinary human beings and the beauty that they can create, even if just for a moment.
B00003CXCT|3.0|I am surprised that no one else is noticing how dark ROTJ looks. ANH looks great, Empire looks good except for a few shots, but ROTJ is very dark and I find it very distracting. The dessert scenes just aren't sunny and vibrant. The endor scenes look even worse. I try to adjust my TV but it just doesn't help. I love this set but I feel that they rushed them a bit. I hope this gets addressed in the future.  I would have waited another year to make sure that I got this set right. Now I guess that I am stuck with it this way.

The writing is brilliant--simple and plain and the stories ran through my head, placing me in San Francisco and in China and introducing me to a world I previous knew nothing about. It has given me a much greater respect and understanding for Chinese people. <br /> <br />I recommend this book with five stars.

Hayden Christensen appears instead of the actor used in the 80's, also Naboo appears in the celebration. THAT'S ALL. <br /> <br />If you own the software of Star Wars , \\"Behind the Magic\\", you'll find images that George Lucas, made of Planet Tatooine and he never incluided. Except in this software. <br /> <br />In DVD 4 it's just the story of mister Lucas and his problems, to take Star Wars to the cinemas, a story we all know. And who cares about the trailers and the making of a videogame?  <br /> <br />It could be a 5 stars pack.

Whether you admit it or not, I'd Do Anything is a catchy tune.  God Must Hate Me is definitely a relatable song as well.  Perfect is atleast a rather refreshing meaningful emoish of song afloat in the meaningless anger of bands like Taking Back Sunday.   <br /> <br />If you buy this CD, you know what you're expecting.  Pop hooks and lyrics that are directed at kids.  I will say they are atleast much more talented than the majority of the crop of the recent pop plague.   <br /> <br />For those who probably wont buy this album, but are curious to the band, I reccommend God Must Hate Me, Worst Day Ever, Perfect and I Won't Be There.   <br /> <br />For kids into this stuff, its a 5-star CD.  However, my interests lye in older stuff, so from me, it's a 3 star.  But hey, like my title says, its better than GC.
B000088NSY|5.0|I used to have this on CD.  When I found out it was being re-released on SACD, I had to have it in that format.  And I can't say that I was dissappointed.  It's stereo but it still sounds better than the CD I used to have.  I love the richness of sound that you get on SACD.
B0001XAPX8|4.0|Phillip Roth's final tale in his trilogy, \\"The Human Stain\\" is set in the summer of The Year Of Our Lord, 1998. Otherwise known as \\"Impeachment Summer\\", during which the Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky accusations took place, The Starr Report was released, and the whole sordid story of the infamous stained dress was on the lips of everyone, so to speak.<br /><br />The film is told in flashback sequences with the narrator of the tale, writer and friend of main character, Coleman Silk's. His name is Nathan Zuckerman (a fabulous Gary Sinese). Incidentally, the character of Nathan Zuckerman is the author, Phillip Roth's alter-ego and is throughout the trilogy of novels.<br /><br />Coleman Silk, played adeptly by Sir Anthony Hopkins, is a 71 year-old college professor at small New England Athena College. Coleman is wrongfully accused of racial slurs against a couple of absent pupils and loses his tenured position. This shocking news sends his beloved wife into sickness and before long, she succumbs...<br /><br />If only his family, friends and all the people that Coleman Silk has touched throughout  their lives knew the REAL story, such charges would have never been brought about in the first place.<br /><br />Silk gets lonely and depressed quite quickly, finds the wonderful drug just produced by the name of Viagra and meets the illiterate but beautiful school janitor, Faunia Farley, played by Nicole Kidman. Faunia might be illiterate but she has graduated with honors from \\"The School Of Hard Knocks\\", both figuratively and literally by her Vietnam vet abusive husband Lester, played excellently by Ed Harris. Coleman and Faunia have a torrid affair with the whole New England town buzzing about the goings on. As they get closer and share with one another, Faunia's past is almost as shocking as Coleman's. In the final scenes of the film, all secrets are exposed...<br /><br />Many critics said that the movie script itself was a masterpiece but it was grossly miscast with Hopkins and Kidman in the main roles. I disagree only because there are very few actors that could genuinely and convincingly portray the characters, let alone, carry a heavy drama such as this. The only actor that I could come up with for a recast on Coleman would be Frank Langella, in part because the physical characteristics of Coleman could have been a bit more believable to the viewer.<br /><br />I must also mention the two actors who play an integral role in the flashback sequences of Coleman's youth. A terrific Wentworth Miller as Young Coleman Silk and an adequate Jacinda Barrett (from MTV's Real World London Cast) in a nice turn as young Coleman's college days lover, Steena Paulsson.<br /><br />Once watching the movie, you will understand the many significant meanings of the title, \\"The Human Stain\\". Not only the stain of the original sin into which all of us are born, but the stain of hate, hurt, pain, racism, pacifism and yes, even love and death.<br /><br />I highly recommend \\"The Human Stain\\" despite it's theatrical release mixed reviews and unfortunate lackluster box office draw.<br /><br />Happy Watching!disagree only because there are very few actors that could genuinely and convincingly portray the characters, let alone, carry a heavy drama such as this.

THIS MOVIE HAD GREAT ACTION AND I NEVER GOT BORED AT ANY SECOND OF THIS MOVIE. RELOADED I DID. WITH RELOADED I JUST WATCHED THE ACTION SCENES, BECAUSE THE IN BETWEEN PARTS WERE SO BORING.<br /><br />THE ENDING TO THIS MOVIE REALLY MADE ME MAD! I WANTED A MORE HAPPY ENDING.

068987474X|5.0|My friend bought me this book for my birthday being that I had just gotten out of a relationship that should have been over months ago. Reading this book, I felt relieved, knowing that it wasn't my fault.  Our relationship was long distance and I gave my all, but he never stayed true on his side.  It's a great book showing us woman that we can move on strong and look positively into the future. And last, I know I will find a guy who will be INTO ME!   Thanks for creating and writing a wonderful book I will share with all my girlfriends!
1577312082|3.0|As the other reviews have said, this book has a lot of outstanding teaching.  However, I have one significant problem with the CD version: it is poorly indexed.  The book is written in a question-and-answer format.  The CD indexes only occur at the start of each chapter, rather than at the start of each question.  Consequently, each disk typically has only two index places to punch to.  If you're listening in the car and are hearing it in bits and pieces, or just want to review the answer to a specific question, you can't just hit the button to go back a track if you're 20 or 25 minutes into a given audio portion.  It possibly works on a home audio system (or a cassette version), but very few car CD players have the capability of a rewind button to allow you to return to a portion of an audio chapter.   <br /> <br />I listened first to Steven King's \\"On Writing\\", and then to these disks, while driving cross country.  At first I wondered why the King disks were indexed approximately every two to three minutes at point that did not necessarily feel like logical breaks.  After listening to a portion of the Tolle disks, and wanting to re-listen to certain segments/questions of the book, I understood why the King disks had been formatted as they were.  It would be helpful if this lesson was carried across all audio books.
B0001DI0FI|4.0|An essential movie for the collection of any fan of things nautical, Peter Weir and the cast deliver an unforgettable sea-faring saga, fraught with danger, and brim full of human interest.<br /><br />The sound effects are spectacular, especially with the benefit of surround sound.  My living room reverberated to the hammering of the nine and eighteen pounders, and every creak of the masts, every flap of the sail, every sour note from Captain Aubrey's violin could be clearly heard. I could almost smell the salty air, as my other senses awakened to smell, taste and touch what my eyes and ears were already experiencing.  Even my sixth sense perked up for a few hours.<br /><br />The battle scenes are vividly enacted, and the cinematography is excellent.  The scene where the ship is becalmed is hauntingly beautiful, making any further explanation superfluous.<br /><br />Russell Crowe portrays Capt. Jack Aubrey as a fearless, intelligent and compassionate man, stubbornly loyal and prepared to risk everything to carry out his orders.  He knows every member of his crew, takes the time to teach young midshipmen naval procedure, and enjoys musical interludes with his friend Dr. Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany).  However, when the opportunity arises to combat the elusive French warship \\"Acheron\\", he almost loses both his ship and his friendship, and pays a bitter price for his ambition.<br /><br />The captain of the \\"Acheron\\" plagues him incessantly, outwitting, outplaying and outlasting him in battle, and Capt. Aubrey has to resort to cunning and disguise to narrow the odds and turn the tide of the battle.<br /><br />A well told story, but drawn out with a few overly dramatic scenes that could have been more comfortable on the cutting room floor.  It also helps to know your nautical terms, which Capt. Aubrey rattles off at top speed, so if you don't know your port from your starboard or your Nautica from your Sperry, you may need an interpreter if you want to fully absorb the movie.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, September 28, 2004sorb the movie. <br /> <br />Amanda Richards, September 28, 2004 <br />
1401301010|4.0|An inspirational story of the many trials and triumphs of a poignantly truthful man.  This book will open doors for some and shed light on others. It's no longer hard to imagine what it's like to be in Mr. Kiedis's shoes as he has left no stone unturned. The magic that comes together to form the band he is the singer for known as Red Hot Chili Peppers is glimpsed through this memoir. I recommend this to anyone who wants to know compassion in it's deepest sense.  <br /> <br />
B000007638|5.0|Though Paul is still great and rocking at age 62, it's no comparison to his voice at age 33. This mix of musicians calling themselves \\"Wings\\" was also his finest version. Joe English, in particular, is a fine drummer, and Denny Laine is forever un-appreciated as a Macca collaberator. <br /> <br /> <br />Great music. Great performances. <br />
B0002OERI0|5.0|this is probally greendays best ccd since kelrplunk almost 10 years ago and its a great cd, get it
B000000OA6|5.0|A tremendous album with incredible variety of music. Innuendo opening track is simply epic, reminds me of Bohemian Rhopsody. This is one of those albums that just flows so well, the tracks are arranged in great order and ofcourse the ending track, The show must go on is a farewell statement by Freddie. Amazing how well and proffessianly Freddie worked despite having AIDS at the time. But ofcourse, we all now Freddie Mercury was one of the classiest people to live in the first place.
B000002KDX|4.0|This has to be the best America album or at least there abouts. I find that with this album that although \\"Horse with no name\\" is the big hit, almost all of the songs are equally as good. All the songs have simple, instantly memorable melodies, the band sounds more unified here and they were able to write extremely accomplished material that was catchy, folky but somewhat sophisticated. The only song I don't like is the album closer, Pigeon Song.    I think it's worthy to note that Dewey Bunnell lead the way here writing six of the twelve songs. His songs tended to be more folk/rock oriented. When Gerry Beckley became more prominent he stated taking the group in a more piano-pop direction.     What I love about this album is the mysterious spin on Acoustic rock that the band employ. This album really puts you in the deserts and plains the band had in mind when recording the material. I like the eerie qualities of Clarice but my favourite song is Three Horses, a nice little groovy folk song about sitting by a fireside with your loved one. America's music captures the simple things in life.
B000089RVX|5.0|I have to say that being a big fan of female soul music, I'm not expected to listen to rock music. People seem so surprised when I play this cd (as loudly as possible), but it's time to stop relying on expectations right? Music is Music and  Amy Lee's voice is just amazing. This band and the front woman are the best blend I've heard in a long time. With CD prices going up and up every day it seems like, This disc is definitely worth the money, even if it may be over priced.
B00005JMUA|5.0|I'm a huge Tarrantino fan, and I consider these volumes to be his best work yet (second going to the classic Pulp Fiction). I highly recommend you pick these up, it's really great moviemaking.
B000099T2L|3.0|With the instant radio hits like \\"Crazy In Love\\", \\"Baby Boy\\", \\"Naughty Girl\\", and \\"Me, Myself, and I\\" out of the way. Beyonce's \\"Dangerously in love\\" takes you on a bus ride of peaks and valleys. With the above mentioned songs giving you an uncontrolable bob in the head for the shy people and for the out-going they just make you get up and dance like nobody's watching. Songs like \\"Hip-Hop Star\\" and \\"That's How You Like It\\" feature big time names Jay-Z and supergroup OutKast, but were even bigger disappointments, fillers at thier worst. The old \\"Dangerously In Love\\" which was featured on Destiny's Child's album \\"Survivor\\" doesn't help being that most of DC3's fans crossed over to Beyonce' for her solo effort. The Immature lyrics of \\"Yes\\" that reminds you of song that could have been on Destiny's Child's earlier release \\"The Writing's On The Wall\\" should've been scrapped. The thoughtful song \\"Daddy\\" while sweet and heartfelt, should have been recorded on a blank CD and given to her father as a gift and not to the fans. \\"Be with You\\" may sound like a song done over and over by other female Soul singers, but some how it works. Beyonce's saves herself with good ones like, \\"Signs\\", \\"Speechless\\", and the great duet with Luther Vandross, whom both deliver great vocals. Beyonce' shows great potential as a solo act with this release. If Beyonce releases another solo record, I would bet that she will up her ante.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Well, what can I say about the Star Wars Trilogy that hasn't already been said? True, George Lucas screwed with it again. True, it may be advertising Episode III a lot. But not only is this the most anticipated DVD box set ever, it is a collection of movies that are a cultural phenomenon. These movies changed history, not just movie history, but cultural history as well. And I have to say, I think they are damn fine movies. The newer ones excluded. Enjoy them for what they are because they are finally on DVD with excellent special features and can now be seen on the excellent quality of DVD format. Enjoy them for their excellent storytelling techniques and the vision and creativness that went into making them. Enjoy them for the sadness and happiness they make millions around the world feel. But do not dislike them simply because Lucas changed a little bit and it is advertising his next movie. That would be silly and narrow-sighted to the big picture.
B0002VKZL6|5.0|Nothing to say except the title, knopfler is a musical genius and this one is his best solo work. A MUST HAVE!!!!! <br />Dont expect large solos of acrobatic licks, because knopfler has nothing to prove to the world about his playing, he is the best and now is trying to bring us his own experinces from a new point of view.  <br />It is really difficult to an artist with such succes as a band to reinvent himself as a solo artist, and Mark has did it once and again.
B000001E18|1.0|Judging from the other reviews that are represented here, many of those reviewers might be from the Official U2 Fanclub. How else to explain such favorable reviews? Right from the start this CD is a snoozer. The first track takes about 1 1/2 minutes to actually get started, (I didn't time it exactly). Usually a band will put something to get you into the mood of the album for the first track. Apparently the purpose of the album is to be a non-prescription sleep-aid. From here the CD doesn't get any better. I expect A LOT MORE from the band that released such classics as Joshua Tree, and Achtung Baby. There was nothing on this release that is memorable, or worth shelling out more than a buck to experience. Listen to you friends copy, and I dare you to stay awake. U2 should be ashamed.
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|This is one of the few movies where the movie is just about as good as the book.  If it's not as good, it's at least close.  This was Henry Fonda's first starring role, and he does an incredbile job as Tom Joad.  Since seeing the movie, I can't read the book without hearing his voice when Tom speaks. <br /> <br />If you aren't familiar with the story, it's the story of the Joad family.  During the Great Depression, these people were forced off their farm in Oklahoma by a combination of dust storms and bankers.  They travel west, hoping for a better life in California, but run into more trouble when they get out to California.  Tom Joad fights injustices against the little guy trying to earn an honest living. <br /> <br />Watch the movie, or read the book.  You can't go wrong either way.
B000268QB2|5.0|I was instantly hooked from the first time I ever heard \\"Somewhere Only We Know\\" absolutely beautiful song. I love the vocals, the melodies......I can listen to this CD over and over and never tire of listening to it......As for all the comparisons to Cold Play, Travis etc.....I don't get it. I think this CD has a completely different feel....Keane is more whimsical, light pop, good feeling with a twist of melancholy through out the whole CD. The songs may sound some what similar but take another look and listen and you will come to appreciate each and every song. They defiantly have their own sound!
B0002UXBD6|5.0|Yes, that's right.  I think this CD is actually better than Dookie.  And not by a hair, or a smidge.  I genuinely think this is Green Day's greatest.  I mean, there are thirteen solid tracks, 21 songs, of some of the best if not THE best songs Green Day has ever written, and they've been arranged into a full on three act opera, making them that much better.  Also, given the times, this CD may also have more social significance than Dookie did.  Dookie brought Punk into the mainstream, but this CD may do so much more.  Yes, this CD attacks our president (and rightfully so), but it is also an attack on the apathetic suburbia that let him rise to power, not to mention stand by as people like Jesus of Suburbia live harsh daily realities that they can only run away from but are doomed to return to.  The story itself starts on President's Day and ends some twenty years later where, after finding his confidence in and ultimately destroying his alter ego St. Jimmy and surviving (probably not by choice) his relationship with the rebellious and insightful Whatsername, Jesus of Suburbia is left alone and looking back on what could have been.  Musically, this is also Green Day's most, diverse and ambitious record ever.  \\"Holiday\\" recalls the mid tempo roll of The Clash.  My personal favorite \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" channels all that is good and melodic (which, I realize, isn't always much) about emo music.  Songs like \\"St. Jimmy\\" and \\"She's a Rebel\\" recall the fast power chords that made Green Day famous.  \\"Wake Me Up...\\" may be the most melodic, sombre, beautiful song they've ever penned, save \\"Good Riddance.\\"  The nine minute songs are also sheer brilliance as each new part just seems to build on the one before it, with \\"Homecoming\\" bursting in the end with the (by this point in the record) anthemic \\"Nobody Likes You/Everyone Left You/They're All out without you/Having fun!\\"  Whatsername is the falling action of a third act, being the perfect closer to this album.  Thereare just no weak points on this album.  There is no filler.  When the energy is high, it is really high.  When this record is mellow, it is really mellow.  This record is dynamic.  It is meaningful.  It is flawless.  It is Green Day's masterwork.
B00005JO5L|4.0|Despite all the bad press and bad reviews this movie received, I actually mostly liked it. Granted, it's not going to go down in history amongst Pacino's finest films or characters. But it really is not that bad of a film, and certainly worth seeing at least once. If nothing else it has rather inadvertently become a glimpse into a lost world; the heavy leather / S&M gay subculture that flourished on both coasts in the era shortly before the onset of AIDS decimated these communities. Many if not nearly all of the men seen in the leather clubs and cruising scenes were extras who were actually into this lifestyle themselves and frequented the very places being filmed or portrayed.<br /><br />The main leather bar scenes were shot in a now-defunct NYC underground sex club in the below street-level basement of the triangle building in the Meat Packing District. But Friedkin was really trying to portray the infamous Mineshaft(which they only could shoot outside of; no cameras were allowed inside). That place was one of the more notorious underground gay sex clubs catering to \\"extreme\\" tastes from about 1976 until the city shuttered it in 1985 due to public health hazards after AIDS began. What a far cry that old late-70's Meat Packing District was from the MPD today; in fact the Mineshaft building itself later sat vacant for nearly 20 yrs, and today it is a pretty chic (straight) club and restaurant, right on that corner where Pacino was filmed walking in by the black door that said \\"Private Club\\". People who would know have said that the place they filmed in was successfully made to look basically just like the Mineshaft used to look on the inside, leather slings, American flag display and all.  Friedkin supposedly also filmed about 40 minutes of essentially hardcore gay porn inside the club where they shot, although this ended up on the cutting room floor.  It was apparently never recovered, or possibly destroyed.  Recently actor James Franco co-produced an indie film called \\"Interior: Leather Bar\\" based on this lost 40 minutes of footage.  It does not however aim to be a \\"remake\\" of Cruising.<br /><br />In any case, Cruising does have something of an eerie dark creepy air to it. I'm not sure why exactly. Granted the subject matter (a killer on the loose) is dark material, but something about those places on those dark streets, in the club, and outside in the trees in Central Park seems truly vaguely menacing in this film. Though it is based on an actual series of murders which occurred in the gay S&M community in the late 70's, called the \\"bag murders\\" (body parts were floating up inside plastic bags), a real and much more potent invisible killer stalked all those places at that very time. In hindsight, that could perhaps lead to the sense of foreboding or darkness there.<br /><br />An interesting aside: in Friedkin's earlier film, The Exorcist, a man had played a very brief role as an X-ray tech, and that extra's name was Paul Bateson. This Bateson was later convicted of the brutal stabbing murder of a gay film critic whom he had met at one of these clubs and lured out, just like the killer in the film, and Bateson remains the primary suspect in these \\"bag murders\\". So Friedkin essentially based the story on this series of murders. Bateson was sentenced to 20 yrs to life although today he may in fact be a free man due to having possibly been paroled, I am not certain. Anyway, if you ever had any interest in the more extreme fringes of the gay community as it had been in the years shortly before AIDS, this movie is like a window into that past. Also, if you're an Al Pacino fan, I think you will enjoy it. He plays his part wonderfully, as always, and interestingly there is also a small part played by Ed O'Neill (\\"Al Bundy\\", and today \\"Jay\\" on 'Modern Family') as one of the police officers investigating the murders. The soundtrack is also pretty unique and consists of a lot of underground rock and funk-type music that was actually popular in the relatively \\"anti-disco\\" type of \\"macho man\\" / \\"clone\\" environment back then.opular in the relatively \\"anti-disco\\" type of \\"macho man\\" / \\"clone\\" environment back then.

B00003CXCT|3.0|I've always wanted to own the Star Wars Trilogy on DVD. I have the original VHS versions, both Original and Special Edition. Both sets of tapes are so old, the quality has become poor. Finally, it's here.  <br />What's great about this DVD release is simply the fact it's on DVD now. There's nothing more than that except for an extra bonus feature type of DVD, which is, in reality, just another documentary (nothing impressive). Over the past 20+ years, any Star Wars fan has seen so many different documentaries of the Star Wars Trilogy that this one added to the DVD set would just bring out the comment, \\"Oh...not again.\\"  <br />I was really disappointed when I found out that each DVD did not have the choice to play the original, unedited version. If you look at all other DVD sets, they usually offer that, and the fact that this Star Wars Trilogy did not offer it upset me and probably millions of other fans. But who knows? Maybe they will release a special, special, special, ...special edition of Star Wars some day with this feature in it. You never know.  <br />It's obvious that some day there will be an 'Episode 1, 2, 3' DVD release along with an 'Episode 1-6' with all the Collector's Editions and Director's Cuts... but I'm not going to wait until then. I want to watch the Trilogy now. So my recommendation would be that if you are seeking those Collector's / Director's Editions or extra special features, don't buy this set...just wait until then. If you're impatient and want to see the old trilogy now on DVD with the THX sound hooked up to your home theatre, go ahead and get this now.
B0000024TQ|5.0|This is definately one of the great pop albums of all time.  To compare this album (a concept album) to \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" is a joke.  \\"Bookends\\" defines Simon & Garfunkel's career.  \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" was a great song, arguably their best, but the album falls short of \\"Bookends\\".  This album has been hailed by some as the greatest pop album of all time.  It's definately in the Top 10 - SOLID.
0064407667|3.0|I hadn't heard anything about this book. In fact, I had read Lemony Snicket's website ages before I ever eventually bought this book and read it. I heard rants and raves about it, but not about the actual story itself. <br /> <br />Honestly, my life would have still been complete if I had never bothered, however, I can see how some would find this book simply wonderful. It has merit, and for those who find it lacked, just remember, this is for kids, not adults. <br /> <br />I enjoyed the book, but found it predictable and wondered as I read if I would have figured it all out when I was younger and the conclusion I came up with was yes. Not a real \\"surprise\\" ending. <br /> <br />I really just read the book because the movie that is coming out this winter season. I see now that I could have simply watched the movie when it comes out and feel totally fine with having never read the book. <br /> <br />In its defense, it is a well-written book and I enjoyed its lack of \\"dumbing-down\\" itself for kids. Many of today's books cater to kids like school textbooks, assuming that they are a few grades below where they really are.  <br /> <br />Would I let my kids read this series? Undoubtedly. <br />
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Okay, so its cliche.  But this album gets pulled out for a singalong more often than almost any other album.  Good to hear some piano based arrangements, Gavins vocals wail and cut through thick accompaniment.  The writing is great, although it doesn't carry huge literary weight, it's light, catchy, and singable.<br />I bought this off a whim - a &quot;staff recommendations&quot; rack at a CD store - and I haven't been sorry since my CD player first walzted through the lead track.
0689859368|3.0|Considering it's a kid's book, I was disappointed, but considering it is a kid's book I shouldn't expect some real heavy writing here, but this...Well..There should have been alot more...    For all the presentation to it and the way it is packaged, I can definitely say do not judge this book by it's cover. While the age recommendation says 9 yrs or older, I'm fairly certain my 6 year old could read this book with minimal trouble. It's simplistically written, and not necessarily in a charming way. Minimal at best, this book left me feeling like I needed to flesh it out by completely re-writing myself with more adjectives, flourishes of the English language and get the idea I had just read an English primer out of my system. I seriously wanted to re-write this book. Make it more and make it better.    It took me an hour to read this book, so I definitely recommend this for the person who does not have patience for long books, not much time on their hands, or has a hard time finishing what they have started. I remember telling my husband after reading this that I was going to start a series of books that only took an hour to read, since this series seemed to be popular and highly simple to read.    A cute story, not much in the way of detail, creativity or whimsy. More of a \\"Dick and Jane\\" book with faeries. Okay, maybe that's a bit harsh, but not something that I would have felt accomplished for having read at the age of 9. Details and descriptions would have been desired.    I am undecided if I will buy the series or not. I like the idea, just wish they had made the books either not so darn short, or at least not so costly. [The offered price]was a steep price for this very short and unfulfilling story.
B000089RVR|5.0|When I was reviewing No Angel a couple of years back, I remembered that I was looking forward what Dido was going to do next. To be hounest is Life For Rent not a great departure but she has matured so much. The songwriting and lyrics are much more consistent and while it still sounds a bit plain in the beginning, all the songs have grown so much on me. This cd is really good to chill with and a couple of songs are about traveling (bought this while traveling in Australia) and bring back some awesome memories.
B00007AJF8|5.0|Charlie Kaufman, the most creative screenwriter currently working today, writes his first theatrical screenplay (Which he was nominated for the Academy Award of Best Original Screenplay). Kaufman's written some TV screenplay but this is his first major one. He is the genius behind not only Being John Malkovich but also two other brilliant and twisted mind-benders: Adaptation (second Oscar nod) and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (a hopeful win). These three films would rank of being the most original comedies ever made. Being John Malkovich is an ingenious dark comedy about three oddball characters who discover a hidden portal which sucks you into the mind of John Malkovich (played by himself). After your 10 minutes of being stuck inside his mind, you're automatically sucked out and dumped near the New Jersey turnpike. Wow! Bizare, huh?  <br /> <br />John Cusack plays Craig, a frusterated and very talented puppeteer in New York who lives in a tiny apartment that's crowded by a bunch of numerous animals (Apes, dogs, birds etc), courtesy from his weirdo, animal-loving  wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz, nearly unrecognizable with that frizzy head of hair. She's never looked this bad). Craig soon finds a job as a filing clerk in a large building in Manhattan in floor 7 1/2 (Yes, literally 7 1/2), which seems to be quite a hassle when using the elevator to get in and walking in a position that would have scoliosis examiners wanting to schedule appointments with these employees. Craig's meets and falls unrequitedly for co-worker Maxine (Oscar nominated Catherine Keener), a sardonic and cold-hearted woman which leaves you with the question of asking; Why would anyone have lovey feeling for such a cold-fish woman? Another question pops in mind too; Why would any woman return the favor of loving Craig back (Since he's such a boring loser-dork)? She wants nothing to do with him but she teases him occassionally. After Craig soon discovers the portal to John Malkovich, he tells Lotte and Maxine.  <br /> <br />It increasingly becomes an obsession for these characters and everything escalates from bad to worse. Craig becomes increasingly psychotic and obsessed with Maxine, Lotte and Maxine have a lesbian relationship (But only when Maxine is in Malkovich's mind), Maxine soon ends up having affairs with Malkovih every now and then, New York residents end up knowing of the portal which is a $200 dollar fee that Craig and Maxine decide to advertise, Malkovich soon begins to realize that something is wrong, etc. I can't possibly go any further since I'd be giving too much away.  <br /> <br />Being John Malkovich is not for everyone since many viewers will find it frusterating and and it's not a real laugh-out-loud kind of comedy. Sure, it has amusing moments, but it's the film's original screenplay and terrific performances that leave you hooked. But if you're really into film, I definitely recommend.
B00003CXCT|3.0|I really enjoyed this trilogy on dvd last week, with my nephews and they really had a good time watching the picture( for thier very first time), the picture and sound quality  are amazing, but those changes made by lucas irritates me too much, but to the kids really liked it, and even they thought that is a continuity of the whole series, well.    but for the old fans there's nothing to ask for, you know why?    Because Lucas is never going to realese the original versions on DVD anymore!!!!    here is an extract of an interview with cnn:      _______________________________________  Question: Why not release both the originals and special editions on DVD?    LUCAS: The special edition, that's the one I wanted out there. The other movie, it's on VHS, if anybody wants it. ...    I'm not going to spend the, we're talking millions of dollars here, the money and the time to refurbish that, because to me, it doesn't really exist anymore. It's like this is the movie I wanted it to be, and I'm sorry you saw half a completed film and fell in love with it. But I want it to be the way I want it to be.      Question: Why did you change your mind and decide to put the original three movies out on DVD now?    GEORGE LUCAS: Just because the market has shifted so dramatically. A lot of people are getting very worried about piracy. That has really eaten dramatically into the sales. It really just came down to, there may not be a market when I wanted to bring it out, which was like, three years from now. So rather than just sit by and watch the whole thing fall apart, better to bring it out early and get it over with.      Question: Do you pay much attention to fan reactions to your choices?    LUCAS: Not really. The movies are what the movies are. ... The thing about science-fiction fans and \\"Star Wars\\" fans is they're very independent-thinking people. They all think outside the box, but they all have very strong ideas about what should happen, and they think it should be their way. Which is fine, except I'm making the movies, so I should have it my way.  __________________________________________        (...)    so what we have to do now is just rent it or buy a pirate copy (the package is even cheap,why did they not copy the design package of the LOTR extended edition?) When you watch the series, and when those changes comes, cover your eyes and go on!    the only good thing is that the canges is only 5% of the whole trilogy, so 95% is the original version so it's worth to watch it, even if it's rented o piracy...    star wars series were a good mopvie and one of the best trilogy of all time, but those changes lucas made, and watching the prequels, the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy is far, far away the best trilogy of all time...  and return of the king the best picture of all time, only behind the God Father part 1...    Thanks GEORGE LUCAS for spoiled one of the most exciting experience i ever lived, and Gollumn really kick lucas ass for that stupid jar jar binks..........
B00003CXCT|5.0|I bought the trilogy the day it came out simply because it belongs in my movie library. As everyone knows this is Star Wars so there isn't really a whole lot to say other than Star Wars has NEVER looked or sounded so extremely wonderful. I absolutely love listening to it on my surround sound stereo. I have already recieved one complaint from an old bitty down the way from my house. I also have to add before I forget, the fourth disc with the bonus footage is wonderful. I love to see documentaries when it comes to Star Wars. Superb Job again George Lucus!
B0002OERI0|5.0|Firstly, i consider myself a fan of most genres of music, so this is not a biased review. I own or have heard many of what are generally considered the best albums ever made, however after hearing \\"American Idiot\\" i feel this should be included on these lists in the future. This album is without a doubt one of the finest ever to be released in recent years. The level of songwriting and performance are truely stand out among a sea of mediocre music that we've been subjected to recently. This cd requires you to listen to it straight through so you can appriciate the story the album tells. however, in case you're interested, i feel the best songs (although they're all good) would be jesus of suburbia and Boulevard of Broken Dreams. Congrats Green Day, on making one of the finest albums ever released.
B00003CXCT|5.0|When i first watch these DVD of EP 4 -EP 6.  It feels like the first time !! The clarity of the picture and the surroud sound is amazing !!  Now you can feel the connection between the prequel and the trilogy in more sense.  Needless to say, some changes in these versions is perfect and make Star wars movies much more value.  The main changes that i could notice are. <br /> <br />EP4 - The new jabba the hut (the best Jabba in SW movies) <br />EP5 - Ian replaced the emperor scene (both act and voices !!!) <br />EP6 - The victory scence, Naboo is added in the ceremony scence   and the most fantastic change and it made Star wars movies completed is Hayden act as Anakin !! (stand beside Yoda and Alec guinness !!).  Even i am the hardcore SW fan since 1977 but i could accept these changes. You have to accept the truth that these are George's movies, it is his intention to let the movies change and i respect that.  Forget the original version (or even 1997's versions) of trilogy if you foreseer the future that the people will continue to watch Star wars again and again in the next 100 years !! 5 stars is not enough !! (Can i give 10 stars ??) GO AND BUY THIS LEGEND DVD BOX SET NOW !!
0553571338|4.0|I love \\"The Giver\\" more and more each time I read it. It is an absolutely unique story that forces the reader to ask many questions concerning life and society. Reading \\"The Giver\\" means stepping into a world where expectations are that everyone is the same. Slight differences are frowned upon and everyone in the community is assigned a specific role. Jonas is a character that displays a vast range of human emotions which makes him easier to relate to. Watching Jonas' life change throughout the novel is painful and thrilling. This book will leave you wanting more and yet questioning what you've just read. I highly recommend \\"The Giver\\". It is a great read and I guarantee you won't soon forget it.
0441003257|4.0|Good Omens is a comedy about, among other things, Judgement Day and the events leading up to it. In typical Pratchett style, things get pretty silly as the Four Bikers of the Apocolypse ride forth while being opposed by and angel, a demon, a prophetess and a prostitute, among others. I don't want to spoil the end for you, but I will say that Gaiman has his fingerprints all over this book.<br /><br />The Good: Well, the book is pretty damn funny. I will warn you ahead of time that if you aren't a fan of either author, then this isn't the book for you. That may seem obvious to you, but you never really know.<br /><br />Pratchett is himself, which is a big plus. The way the man can crack me up with a simple comment from a character such as \\"...\\" or \\"Urg\\", or from a description of a bank of computers can have me rolling is amazing. I really look forward to reading his books, as he never fails to amuse me.<br /><br />As for Gaiman, I only have experience with him from Neverwhere, which I enjoyed, but I could see his flavor coming through the characters. It was a little strange, seeing his introspections mixed with Pratchett's crazy humor, but most of the time I enjoyed the mix. I can say that this book wouldn't have probably been as good if either were not part of it.<br /><br />The Bad: Maybe it was just me, but I was expecting a little more laugh out loud moments. This may not be fair, as the book was published over 14 years ago, and as mentioned before I love Pratchett, so it's possible that I am overcritical, but that's the beauty of book reviews. This takes it down a few notches.<br /><br />Also, some of the purely English jokes lost me, which isn't really a knock, it's just a note.<br /><br />Conclusion: I enjoyed this book, but as I noted above I was probably expecting more then is fair. The book probably wouldn't have been as fun if not for the collaboration, though. Each author has his influence on the book, and it can clearly be seen. If you are a fan of silly things, and/or either of these authors, I would recommend this book.s, and/or either of these authors, I would recommend this book. <br />

0440180295|4.0|Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five is a fantastic, mind grabbing story about life, war, and death.  Vonnegut writes with simple words that carry powerful ideas in this classic anti-war novel.  In the book, Vonnegut's protagonist, Billy Pilgrim essentially becomes \\"unstuck\\" in time.  Throughout the novel, Billy travels back and forth through time describing his service for the American military during WWII, his witnessing of the infamous bombing of Dresden, and his later life in the 50's and 60's.  This novel would be easy for anyone to enjoy, but I would recommend it only to teenage or adult readers strictly because the book's jumpy plot does require the reader to put together ideas for themselves.  Despite the randomness of the plot, Vonnegut's use of incredible imagery makes the story easier to follow.  Over all, this book is definitely worth reading!
B0002NIAZW|4.0|OK, this is not a truely great movie, but it is not just another Hollywood production. A well written script doesn't need great dialogue, just look at The Beachcombers.  The theme is a well used one: unbelievably, son waits for Poppa to save the day.  The acting is reasonably good for the genre, the suspense builds up appropriately, there are a few surprises in the plot and the political figures are pretty close to reality.  Deep Impact had science that was more believable, had better character development and more ominous foreshadowing.  Independance Day had science that was far sillier, unbelievable characters and a very predictable plot line, though it was fun and meant to be an action/comedy.   <br />I wonder about Mr Shannon's credentials as he dismisses the science behind the Day After Tomorrow disaster.  As the father in the movie said, it is highly unlikely for an ice age to descend upon the world as fast it did in this movie, but how many has humanity witnessed?  I recommend this for boys night at the movies or as cautionary tale for the family. Humanity's effect on the world just might spell our own demise. Earth will go on...we may not.
B00005JN7O|5.0|I like this movie a lot, It's a great film and the story too. They don't make movies like this anymore. It's exiting, drama, adventure and sci fi too.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Having stumbeled over Green Day a year ago, I quickly became absorbed by their punk-alternative style and rebellious attitude. \\"American Idiot\\" blends hard punk and alternative with stick-in-your-head beats throughout the album. Different attitude come with each song, from the almost emo \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" to the political protest \\"American Idiot\\" this album is sure to please every taste in the punk genre.
0142004235|4.0|There were times, in the middle of the book, when I was so bored by the writing style and I wanted to stop reading it. But I was patient and it paid off. At times I wanted to give the novel two stars, then three stars, then four stars, and it probably deserves a full mark. But I'm keeping it at four stars to tell some readers, especially those who haven't read classics before, that it's not an easy read. <br /> <br />I've read \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" and \\"Angels and Demons\\" by Dan Brown before reading this. They were entertaining throughout, but you forget them the moment you finish them. East of Eden, although boring at times, had an impact on me and changed the way I look at life. It just gives you wisdom and a new perspective. And that's what makes a book a great book. I may revisit this epic again. <br />
B00005JNEI|5.0|I found this interesting.  Sure its biased, but so is most, if not all of what the media tells us on a daily basis.  <br /> <br />I find it interesting that most of the critics here say it is \\"full of lies\\" but fail to provide enumerate a single one much less prove it. <br /> <br />It is also sad that people here and elsewhere have to comment on Moore's weight.  If the worst thing you can say about a movie is that the filmmaker is overweight, I guess it can't be all that bad.  It just seems like a cheep shot to me and totally without merrit as an argument for or against the film.  To those people, I say, \\"grow up\\" <br /> <br />As to the politics, watch the film and maybe others.  Read the propaganda from both sides.  Ultimately, its your decision but I really am sick of people panning this film because they disagree with the viewpoint.  The fact that he can express his viewpoint freely is what makes this country great.
0790737973|4.0|Academy award winner Dustin Hoffman (Dr. Norman Johnson), Sharon Stone (Dr. Beth Halperin), and Samuel L. Jackson (Dr. Harry Adams) star as an underwater team with the task of discovering the secrets of an alien spacecraft that crashed to earth 300 years ago. <br /> <br />A ship laying fiberoptic cable accidentally hit an obstruction on the bottom of the sea.  This obstruction turned out to be the spacecraft, which crashed in the year 1709.  An unknown lifeform is presumed to be on board.  The fuselage of the craft is over 1/2 mile long and signs are being detected from the craft. <br /> <br />The team is sent to an underwater habitat 1,000 feet below the ocean surface to learn underwater techniques and begin their study of the spacecraft.  Soon, the crew leaves the habitat and and makes their first journey to the spacecraft.  After exploring for a time, doors begin to open mysteriously and strange footprints are discovered. <br /> <br />The scientists theorize that the ship flew into a black hole, travelled backward through time and crashed into the ocean.  Meanwhile, a huge golden sphere is discovered on the spacecraft. <br />Harry decides to enter the sphere to see if he can find out what it does.  Norman decides to investigate and finds Harry lying outside of the sphere.  Unconscious but alive, Harry is taken back for observation.  In the meantime, the crew discovers that they have become seperated from the submarine, leaving them isolated in the habitat. <br /> <br />The crew discovers a code within their computer system.  This code turns out to be the aliens trying to communicate.  They communicate in very basic language such as an adult would use with a child, but what happens if the aliens get mad? <br /> <br />Outside the habitat, Beth and Norman barely escape from the aliens.  Back inside, the aliens are getting angry and sending messages saying \\"I will kill you all\\".  Will the crew survive or will the aliens succeed in killing everyone?  And what secretsdoes the sphere hold? <br /> <br />I thought this was a very good film.  Dustin Hoffman, Sharon Stone, and Samuel L. Jackson are excellent in their roles, and the visual and special effects are superb.  Watch this movie and experience some good underwater terror and suspense.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|Hey Kyle, you are CLUELESS !  This is a great movie.  After looking at your list of movies, its pretty clear that you are not credible.
B00005V9IL|1.0|The one star is for the single disk edition of the abyss. The back of the box claims it has 5.1 audio when in fact it does not! I returned the first one I bought thinking it may be an isolated incident, but much to my surprise it was the same!! I have e-mailed fox video several time's but they do not answer, I guess they don't care about their costomers. If you enjoy 5.1 surround as I do then dont buy this movie ,it is defective!!
B000000W5L|5.0|EXILE ON MAIN STREET is the best Rolling Stones album ever made. The songs are expressions of the tensions the band members were feeling at the time, and it shows how the band used blues, R&B, and soul influences to create their own expressions of dread and fear. If you only have room for one Rolling Stones album, this should be it.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|Being the dork that I am, i read Pitchfork Media constantly, five days of the week in fact. They have been pretty good to me so far, they introduced me to the beauty of M83, and countless other wonderful albums. Their point/rating system is absolutely wretchid (who gives a ten point scale, and then gives albums fractions of the 10? It's quite absurd) and to be quite honest, some of their reviews are wretchid. They have panned many albums which i thought were wonderful. So, upon reading the 'fork one morning, they had 'funeral' up for reading. They gave it a 9.7, and wrote a great review of the album. I picked it up as soon as I could, put it on, listened and was enthralled. The songs grabbed me as soon as i heard them. Great strings, extremely catchy melodies, that differ on every song, a wonderful vocalist (think conor oberst) made this one of the best things i have hear in a long while. I must say, that after listening to this many times now, i think it is my album of the year, and i beleive it will be many peoples, and many indie magazines album of the year, or at least damn close to it. Buy this album, and enjoy the ride it throws you.
B000000W5N|5.0|STICKY FINGERS is a great Rolling Stones album. The band was starting to feel the affects of aging (a 28-year-old rocker was considered old in 1971), and a sense of desperation infuses even the prettiest song here, \\"Wild Horses.\\" If you can only get one other Rolling Stones album besides EXILE ON MAIN STREET, make it this one.
B0002VKZL6|3.0|Hearing Mark's voice and signature guitar is always a pleasure, like greeting an old friend. That said, the tunes here have a laid-back feel which make for easy listening. They all have a lazy synchopated pace reminiscent of JJ Cale although Mark's guitar never really blazes. I put on this disc for the first and waited for the songs to take flight although none of them really did. In the long run, this release is unlikely to be Mark's most memorable and certainly pales to anything he ever did with Dire Straits. If you're a completist like myself and Must Have everything Mr Knopfler has released, then pick it up. Otherwise, the more inspired \\"Sailing To Philadelphia\\" recording which was released in '2000 is a much better choice.
B000003BF1|5.0|LET IT BLEED, STICKY FINGERS, and EXILE ON MAIN STREET are the greatest Rolling Stones albums ever. All three have a sense of desperation that even Nirvana and Pearl Jam can't match, and they do it by using traditional blues and soul influences. If you get those three albums as your first Rolling Stones purchases, you can't go wrong.
B000002J03|5.0|I dont know where to begin....every song on this cd is amazing. From the thunderous drumming of John Bonham to the amazing guitar work via Jimmy Page, this cd is amazing. A song review.... <br /> <br />Whole Lotta Love: 10/10. Probably Led Zeppelin's most famous song next to Stairway. A classic. <br /> <br />What is and What Should Never Be: 9.5/10 A great song...not my favorite. Has some very good vocal performances by Mr. Plant. <br /> <br />The Lemon Song: 10/10 A bluesy number....very creative metaphor...ahem....great song. <br /> <br />Thank You: 10/10 A slower more balladesque tune with great lyrics. My favorite Zeppelin ballad next to the Rain Song. <br /> <br />Heartbreaker: 10/10 A great song with the album's best guitar work. A groundbreaking solo for the time, which later influenenced Eddie Van Halen to develop his two hand tapping method.  <br /> <br />Living Loving Maid: 9/10: Probably my least favorite song on the album....but still a good song. <br /> <br />Ramble On: 10/10 A great song with an excellent acoustic intro and great lyrics. This song quickly picks up speed and turns into a rocker. <br /> <br />Moby Dick: 10/10 An excellent instrumental with Bonham's best drumming on the album.  <br /> <br />Bring it On Home: 10/10 Starts off kinda bluesy but then unleashes with one of my favorite Zep riffs. Great guitar work by Page brings an excellent end to an excellent album. <br /> <br />The Verdict: A truely revolutionary album for the time, (1969!!!) one of Zep's best if not their best, every song on this album is excellent. Bring this baby on home.
0380002930|5.0|I first became familiar with the world of \\"Watership Down\\" when I saw the movie as a child - it was one of my favourite movies when I was about 5 years old. So, you can imagine my delight when I came across the book in a bookstore many years later! Ah, to re-connect with the \\"bright-eyed\\" (the movie features the Art Garfunkel song, \\"Bright Eyes\\") innocence of my inner child! I read this book in a matter of days, so engrossed was I in this magical tale! <br /> <br />I won't bother with a synopsis of the book, as many previous readers have posted eloquent reviews detailing the characters, plot, etc. I will, however, emphasize that this fabulous book may be read on many levels: to some, it is simply a tale about the adventures of a group of rabbits trying to find a new home; to others, it is an allegorical tale depicting a very human society and its conflicts. <br /> <br />(As an aside, I would also like to add that I was pleasantly surprised by the realistic behaviour of the characters in this book: anyone who has ever owned a rabbit knows that they are not always the sweet little balls of fluff everyone makes them out to be!) <br /> <br />Sadly, I think there are many adults out there that will pass over this book because they see it as a children's story about talking rabbits. And, on the superficial level, that is exactly what it is. But, to truly grasp the brilliance of this book, you must delve deeper than just the words printed on the page - this is a story that you actually --GASP!-- have to use your brain to truly understand! Unfortunately, many of the readers who gave this book a low rating were forced to read it at school - a tragedy, since not all youths will be mature enough in the literary-sense to understand that the book is an allegory. <br /> <br />This book is not for everyone. If you can't get past the idea of \\"talking rabbits\\", you probably won't enjoy this book; if you cannot stand verbose descriptions (a la J.R.R. Tolkien), you probably won't enjoy this book; if you don't enjoy having to read between the lines to \\"get\\" what a book is truly trying to say, you probably won't enjoy this book... But to everyone else: EXPAND YOUR MIND & READ THIS BOOK!
B0001CCXZW|5.0|In Ireland we don't get the Gilmore Girls that often and they tend to mess up the order and leave out episodes. I travelled to the US during the summer and bought this box set. Obviously enough it doesn't work on the European DVD players -so i went out and bought a region free DVD player especially! That is how good this DVD is. The Gilmore Girls is hilarious quick-witted and sweet all at the same time. To be honest there isn't enough of a fuss made about the program over here which is a little annoying. If you like comedy and great story lines then this DVD is the way to go. There is no way you could possibly be disappointed! Personally I just can't wait for the next season to come out on DVD!
B00000273M|5.0|I have had this CD since basically it came out in 1990 ... and it is still one that I will pop in fairly often.  Some of the other reviewers have mentioned about how impressed they were with the band's ability to play as a BAND!  I saw them live around 1986 and had fourth row seats dead in the middle.  The songs that night sounded even better than they did on the records and they really had the crowd going.  Susanna Hoffs looked even better in person...ahhh...to be 18 again and watching the Bangles in concert...good memories....buy the disc, it is definitely worth the money.
1401301010|4.0|I am reading this book now and it is fantastic, If you are a Red Hot Chili Peppers fan you got to read it, It tells you the history of the band and him. You really see how his childhood is filled with drugs and sexual things. We see how his life is scared such as the title of the book refers.  We see how it effects him. We see how women play a big role in his life because he talks about that most of the book, it is basically him in a band and life with girls. Excellent biography, very intresting, not for teens under 13 a lot of swaering and refers a lot to sex. Go out and buy this book. Has amazing pictures also. Also tells you how some songs came to be.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I laughed even harder the second time I saw this movie. An instant cult classic.
0060012218|5.0|Brent Hartinger has something to say, & does it well. Teens, both gay & straight, will find GEOGRAPHY CLUB intriguing & familiar territory. It is fast paced, funny, & a telling portrait of contemporary teenagers as they maneuver through the treacherous social terrain of a typical American high school & the even more rocky landscape of the human heart. <br /> <br />These young adults, testing their maturity, are all likable & flawed, like everyone, & totally believable. <br /> <br />Rebeccasreads highly recommends GEOGRAPHY CLUB as a \\"can't put it down\\" read. Who do you think should be in the movie?
B00000269G|5.0|This is a five star album without question and one of my favorite jazz albums of all time. I've heard \\"C by the Sea\\" on both record and compact disc and concluded that the old LP sounds significantly better than this 1990 CD. It's about time Sony remasters this seminal jazz classic properly for the CD format. Until then, I'm sticking with my vinyl copy. Incidentally, if you're wondering how good this music really is, just listen to the opening 20 seconds of \\"Red Top,\\" available for your sampling pleasure right here on Amazon. This should tell you all you need to know. Man, could this guy play. If only he had lived longer, I might have gotten a chance to see him perform live.
B00003CXCT|5.0|For everyone who thinks this trilogy stinks your wrong ive grown up with Star Wars and i love every singal movie even the new ones so for everyone who loves Star Wars get this movie and for all the bad reviews they can just crawl into a little hole and live their insigneficant little lives in infamy!!!
B000002AS3|5.0|Wow. 10 years is a long time. 10 long years it's been since Definitely Maybe was released. This is an album that, for millions of people in the UK atleast, defined a generation. <br /> <br />When this album came out i thought it was the most amazing thing i'd heard. It got me into music, i stopped being embarrassed about liking a particular type of music 'just in-case' it wasn't popular. <br /> <br />Fortunately for me, it just happened to be one of the most important bands to emerge from England for many a moon. Oasis led an assualt on the british music scene like no other band had done for years, catching the mood of a nation perfectly. It is fair to say that if you listened to this album for the first time in this day in age, you would probably notice it's age. For me, this is it's beauty. It encapusulates everything that the music scene in the mid 90's needed. <br /> <br />I can understand why the general American populace didn't embrace Oasis as the British public did. Too much arrogance and angst whilst touring wouldn't wouldn't encourage any new listeners. Trust me when i say that all the BS that surrounds the gallagher brothers feuding, fighting and bitching just clouds the fact that Oasis just do really good songs. <br /> <br />I've never given an album such a glowing report in my life, but when i really think of all the good times i've had listening to this album, no album i know of deserves such praise. <br /> <br />I hope i haven't rattled on for too long... <br /> <br />Buy It, an essential to anyone's CD collection. <br /> <br />Cheers!
B000007492|4.0|While I don't really like most of the songs all that much,(In fact I can't remember their names) the several that I love give me a feeling of euphoria. This hits collection is worth its weight in gold just to have great songs like Take The Long Way Home and Give A Little Bit.(The Logical Song is cool, too) I guess what really turns me on about these kinds of songs is that they get you high. They just seem to have such a positive vibe. Driving home from work is one wild experience when you crank those tunes. I can't can't keep the speedometer under 80mph and I can't keep the volume under 120 decibels. <br /> <br />The sound is similar to perhaps a band like YES and if you are interested at all in that kind of 70s rocking sound then this is way more than a worthy purchase.
B0002VKZL6|5.0|I think this is by far Knopler's best solo effort.  He's tuneful, professional, and a great song writer.  I was really struck by how many of the songs are political in one way or another: \\"5:15\\" about the coal miners, \\"Boom, Like That,\\" a critique of Ray Kroc, founder of McDonalds, \\"Sucker Row,\\" a song about a kind-of pimp, but really an indictment of cowboy capitalism, \\"Song for Sonny Liston,\\" about how he was crushed by the system, and the finale, \\"Don't Crash the Ambulance,\\" all about the lusty cynicism at the core of American foreign policy.  (This last one: is it my imagination, or could this be George Bush Senior talking to George W. Bush?)  In all of these songs except \\"Sonny Liston,\\" Knopfler very effectively employs the first-person approach to reprehensible characters that was so effective in \\"Money for Nothing.\\"  The topical songs are effectively balanced by some beautiful ballads, my favorite being \\"All That Matters.\\"  It's like a reminder that as screwed up as the world is, all that matters is the relationships you have with those you love. <br /> <br />Haven't listened to an album over and over again like I'm doing this one in a long time.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|Whatever happened to the hard core Slipknot I loved? This album totally blows. I'll break this album down by song. <br /> <br />1. Prelude - Sucks.        <br />2. Blister Exists - Sucks.       <br />3. Three Nil - Sucks.     <br />4. Duality - Sucks.        <br />5. Opium of the People -Sucks.        <br />6. Circle - Sucks.        <br />7. Welcome - Sucks.        <br />8. Vermilion - Sucks.         <br />9. Pulse of the Maggots - Sucks.         <br />10. Before I Forget - Sucks.       <br />11. Vermilion, Pt. 2 - Sucks.        <br />12. Nameless - Sucks.        <br />13. Virus of Life - Sucks.        <br />14. Danger - Keep Away - Sucks. <br /> <br />Slipknot used to be the most hardcore band around, now they write these pop tunes. I would highly reccomend this album to any fan of Kenny G, Avril Lavigne, Limp Bizkit, Backstreet Boys, and the like.  <br />
0385336810|5.0|Finished this book in one weekend.  My husband was amused to find me turning pages and laughing outloud.  The story is at once engaging, amusing, and charming.
B00003CXCT|3.0|The one good thing about this trilogy is the picture quality. Even you hardcore fans that hate the added features must admit that. I remember back in the 80's when I was watching Star Wars on VHS how grainy it all seemed at some parts. For the most part I hated the added special effects, well I hated them all except one. Let's face it, the added scene in Jabba's palace with the aliens singing Tina Turner type songs was not only unnecessary, but downright retarded. That one, more than any other really p*ssed me off. But the one scene that I really didn't mind was at the end of Return of the Jedi, when they showed the celebration carrying on through the rest of the galaxy as opposed to just on Endor. However, I didn't approve of the addition of Hayden Christenson as the image of Anakin next to Obi Wan and Yoda. Bottom Line, buy it only if you've given up all hope that the \\"real\\" originals will ever be released.
068987474X|1.0|Lady Cascadia, you were DEAD ON in your review of this book.  I was nodding my head and giggling in agreement to everything you said in your review.  I am also a very powerful woman, like you, very aggressive in my normal life.  For me to sit back and wait for a man is hogwash - since I never sat back and waited for a good career, etc. - I took the bull by the horns.  I feel that while this book gives some good advice - please people, give the women a little more credit.  Women definitely DO know in their hearts if a man is not into them - we call it FEMALE INTUITION!  Ever heard of it?!  And life is also not black and white.  There are different situations in every relationship that might not cause it to go the way this book says it should.  To make a blanket statement on every relationship is ridiculous and an insult to all the intelligent women out there who have their lives under control WITHOUT a man, thank you very much!  And yes why can't I talk to a man, call him, or ask him out?  I'm not talking STALKING here!  GEEZZZZ!  This book was pretty much an insult to my intelligence and innate power as a woman - and an insult to the great feminine power inherent in all women.  The bottom line is this - if you are meant to be with a certain guy, it will happen - whether you call him or not, whether you ask him out first or not, or whether he takes years to \\"make up his mind\\" or not!!!  Ladies there is such a thing as destiny so let's seek OUR OWN happiness in the ways that make US happy - and THE MEN THAT MAKE US HAPPY and not take the advice of supposed \\"well meaning\\" (attached or married) friends or garbage books like this.
B00005JLKB|4.0|Everyone knows or at least is somewhat familiar with the story of Superman.  However, no one really knows the story of Clark Kent, especially his teenage years when his powers began to develop.  That's where Smallville comes in.    By the time you read this review you will no doubt have read countless others telling you the main plot of the series, so I won't waste my time on that.  I will tell you that if you are a fan of Superman or are somewhat intrigued with the concept of Superman and would like to learn where he got his powers and what shaped him into the hero we all know, then Smallville is the series for you.    The first season of the series was for the most part strong in it's presentation, there were some weak moments and the freak of the week thing kind of got old, especially since both Angel and Buffy had done it to death already.  However annoying the freak of the week was, it was a necessary annoyance to propel the first season along.  Here's a kid that's to become Superman, he starts out the season with super-strength, super-speed, and is mostly invulnerable, he needs someone to fight that will pose somewhat of a challenge, therefore freaks are needed.    The episodes for the most part were formulaic this first season, with this basic premise:  introduce freak, explain freak, have freak cause some form of trouble, Clark overcomes freak and learns some kind of lesson to apply to his future heroic life.  There were some episodes that broke this formula, the episode \\"Stray\\" was one, where the freak of the week is not a villain but rather becomes somewhat of a younger brother to Clark.  Another focuses on a rogue Metropolis cop that tries to use Clark and his abilities for his own gain, under the guise of trying to rid the world of evil.  The last episode that broke these rules was \\"Vortex\\" which also served as the cliffhanger/season finale.  This episode was an intense episode that presented Clark with the challenge of facing a non-human enemy, tornadoes.    The acting in the series was great and has advanced in every season.  Tom Welling seems shy at first but becomes comfortable with his role as Clark Kent and is totally believable after a few episodes.  Michael Rosenbaum and John Glover as the Luthor's are awesome together on screen as they go round-and-round with each other.  The special effects are great, and also have improved with each season.    Overall an excellent beginning to a saga we all know and to a top-notch series.  Highly recommend.
B00008OLYN|5.0|This is quite simply one of the best progressive rock CDs I have heard in the past few years, even though I am not normally a fan of Opeth's music.  Opeth's usual sound consists of very heavy death-metal sections (complete with growling vocals, which I personally am not fond of) alternating with lighter retro-prog-rock passages.  However Damnation is unique among Opeth's catalog in that it is composed entirely of the lighter portion of their sound, with no death-metal elements whatsoever.  The music on Damnation is quiet and somber throughout, with mournful, haunting vocals that sound nothing like the heavy passages on their other discs.  The songs are fairly simple and stripped-down by progressive rock standards, though the instrumental performances are all top-notch.  Yet in spite of its relative simplicity, or perhaps because of it, the music on Damnation is very powerful.  I can't quite find a way to put into words exactly what it is that makes Damnation so great; all I can say is that in my opinion it is a masterpiece and a future classic.  I would recommend it for any fans of the progressive rock genre, though I would not recommend Opeth's other works unless you also happen to be a fan of death-metal.
B0002J4X1Q|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. There was plenty of action,blood,and zombies. I was most pleased with the dogs,they are my favirote. I was a little disappointed with the Licker. I thought it looked really fake. I liked this movie very much because it keeps you guessing and your not sure what is going to happen. I liked Michelle Rodriguez, she had a few lines that I thought where funny. I also thought Milla Jovovich kicked ass in this movie! The movie is even better with the commentary on! Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriuez have alot of funnt things to say about the movie.
B000005RT8|4.0|After over ten years of releasing single after glossy smash single, Paul McCartney lets fly this wonderfully eclectic collection of songs.  The studio version of 'Coming Up' is helium-induced white robot funk.  'Temporary Secretary' is a brain-hurting synthesizer sequence with crowed vocals.  If you can't handle early DEVO or Suicide, this one may run you out of the room.  It ranks with Alice Cooper's 'Clones' and ELO's 'Yours Truly, 2095' as one of the best New Wave songs done by an outsider to the scene.  Amazing!  On the rest of the album McCartney goes on to lay down some blues, (silly) love songs, Casio-driven instrumentals, and whatever other styles strike his fancy.  The hymnal 'Summer's Day Song' reminds me of Eno's 'Spider and I' off Before and After Science.  Yes, I just said that.  The joyously neverending bonus track 'Secret Friend' (originally the B-Side to 'Temporary Secretary') has an exotic/tropical feel and may remind electronic music lovers of Yellow Magic Orchestra.  So you're asking, \\"how can one ex-winged-beatle sound like so many other musical pioneers?\\".  Well, McCartney II quite possibly proves that it was McCartney all along who wore the shiny pants in the family.
0226039331|5.0|Don't listen to one reviewer's suggestion to save some money and buy a used second edition.  Gordon D. Fee in his masterful introduction to exegetical method, says very strongly: <br /> <br />\\"This third edition of Bauer is a considerable improvement over the first two editions--so much so that if you have not yet purchased a lexicon, THIS ONE IS A MUST (rather than a secondhand second edition, for example).\\" <br /> <br />There simply isn't anything that beats this one, and so if digging into the bible is what you want, you have to get the right tools.  This is the shovel for you.  Save up and accept no alternatives.  You will be happy you got this work.
B00013F38K|4.0|I remeber my father turning off the TV while we were watching \\"KITT\\" and telling us about this \\"Kung Fu\\" series... <br /> <br />So when he saw this first season on DVD package we both went back to our childhood...  <br /> <br />After watching this series I surely would turned off the TV while KITT hour...  <br /> <br />I hope they (somebody at Warner Brothers) decide offer us the second and third seasons AS SOON AS POSIBLE! <br /> <br />I give it only 4 stars because of the \\"special features\\", they would put another chapter instead of this, i hope they give us the 62 chapters instead of \\"special features\\" on 2 sides.
B00003CXCT|3.0|Obviously, the DVD version has been long awaited, and now sadly, quite lamented. While the picture quality is spectacular, and the sound is top notch, a few glaring errors on the part of a crazy George Lucas ruin the entire package. Now I was never one of the super-purists, though I am the biggest Star Wars fan. The Special Edition didn't bother me too much when it came out, besides the Return of the Jedi musical number. But some of the changes to the DVDs are inexcusable. I'm not talking about the little changes; clean ups and the like are actually great looking. Obviously, George Lucas has become so rich and prosperous that he is surrounded only with yes men. If he had come up to me and asked me to make the lightsabers look so lame and put Hayden \\"I can't act my way out of a paper sack\\" Christensen in the final shot of the trilogy, I would have told him what a jerk he was. But alas, no such creature exists on Skywalker Ranch. Luke's lightsaber in ROTJ is terrible. In the desert scene, the lightsaber is so bright you can't see anything else in the shots. Also, the length changes drastically from shot to shot, and the thing is way too green. Also, Darth Vader having a bright neon pink lightsaber is just wrong. Alas, the shame. Maybe when George Lucas kicks the bucket, his kids will release the actual movies. Here's to hoping.
B0002OERI0|4.0|Powerfull and as usual fun always fun as the main ingredient that Green Day add in their music , you have to listen \\"give me novacaine\\" wow !!! wow !!! wow !!! I love this kind of bizarre passionate songs , the band have also reached certain level of maturity and thats ok , they cant continue forever on the same careless mood and simplicity in their lyrics, that simply had to come soon or later if this kids want to continue in showbussiness, \\"wake me up when september ends\\" is a beautifull piece, for obvious reasons that song will make remove your fibers, the rest of the songs are very good and that kind of epic songs are excellent , Green Day has offered a great album once again, nobody expected less <br />HM
B00000251N|5.0|I've always been a huge fan of the book Jonathan Livingston Seagull, so initially I was skeptical of this soundtrack, worrying that it may get in the way of the message of the book.  Although I've never seen the movie which the music was designed for, this album keeps pace with the \\"Endless Human Potential\\" message of the book. <br /> <br />Neil Diamond should be very proud of this work, because as other reviewers have stated, it really has the ability to withstand the test of time and even gain new listeners from the my cynical \\"generation Y\\".  I go to sleep with it playing almost every night at college, and even during the day when I'm trying to work on stuff.  It seems to be catching on, because I always have people ask me questions like, \\"who sings that?\\", \\"what's it called?\\", \\"where's it from?\\", and now I have managed to make most in my dorm a believer in \\"the gull\\" if you will.   <br /> <br />Overall, its perfect music that curtails itself to any atmosphere, and that's hard to find.  (as of right now, I believe the lowest rating on the reviews here was a 4 star, and that too is a testament to the greatness of the album)
B00005JNEI|5.0|...but it definitely deserves Best Picture! It is poetic, beautiful and poignant. It allows its subject all the rope it needs to hang itself and then, without invective, allows us to pull the noose tight ourselves. It's Mike's best movie because he stays to the side allowing the events to speak for themselves. Anyone who says this movie is a bunch of lies has not seen it. It is mostly a collage of images that have been woefully absent in the major media since day one. There is very little commentary from Moore, there doesn't need to be. And everything is well documented and vindicated by the 911 commissions own report...
B000066NW0|5.0|I was totally blown away when I heard how this young woman can sing. My husband's a musician and he agrees that she really phenominal. Avril also wrote most of the songs on this CD, which equals a powerhouse of talent for someone who's only 20 years old. You will love this CD... her voice is mezmerizing.
B00005JN7O|2.0|Every so often a movie comes out which nearly the whole world seems to love, and I seem to be the only one out there who just doesn't think it's all that great.  Such is the case with SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW.  The previews to this movie made it look like it was going to be one of the best movies to come out this year.  But I found this film to be quite forgettable (in spite of the fact that it does have several genuinely enjoyable parts). <br /> <br />The fact of the matter is that SKY CAPTAIN runs away with a plot and does not bother to invite the viewer along.  The storyline is set en media res - a Latin phrase which means \\"in the middle of things\\" - implying that there was a lot of previous goings on between the main characters, but these things are told in such a contrived and unoriginal way that I thought I was watching Indiana Jones and Marion Ravenwood duke it out over their bitter affair from yesteryear (reference from RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK). <br /> <br />My primary problem with this film is not the unemotional dialogue or the overwhelming amount of CGI (which almost never makes a movie look good) but the fact that the filmmakers could not decide what they wanted this film to be.  It almost works as a vintage throwback to the old classic serials of the 1930s.  It almost works as a comic book come to life.  It almost works as a marvelous special effects show.  It almost works as an Indiana Jones-type thriller (I personally think they were overdoing that one just a tad.)  And it almost works as an artistic cinematic experiment.  But the people who made this film decided to throw all of these ingredients into the same bowl, hoping for the best.  Sometimes a movie can be all of those things, but it's a rarity.  SKY CAPTAIN makes a valiant effort but runs out fuel just short of the landing strip.  Got kids?  Take them to see this movie for some good clean fun.  But don't expect too much substance.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I never saw this on tv, and I'm not even sure if it was broadcast in Britain, but I picked it up anyway simply based on what everyone on the IMDb and Amazon were saying about it, and that it was a Joss Whedon show and I liked his other series Buffy and Angel.  Firefly has the same high quality of writing as these shows, but due to Fox's foolish decision to cancel the series the story arc never had a chance to really get going, though there are enough indications of where it was heading to make it extremely frustrating that the network never gave it a chance. <br /> <br />The firefly universe is a very original one, owing little to any previous Sci-fi series I can remember with no alien races mentioned.  Basically in this universe there are a number of hi-tech and economically rich core worlds, where the flying cars, laser weaponry, futuristic cityscapes and the other things familiar from other Sci-fi series live.  However in the course of the series these are hardly ever visited.  Instead the stories take place in the terra-formed outer worlds, where everything is very low-tech; conventional firearms, horses to get around, a frontier, often rather lawless, Wild West aspect to many of the places, where survival is very much a struggle but things are still kept together by visiting space traders, such as the Firefly class ship Serenity on which our heroes live and work.  If the core worlds are the equivalent of modern day First World USA and Western Europe, these outer worlds are the equivalent of our more poverty stricken Third World.   <br /> <br />Earth is never mentioned much, except when people refer to \\"Earth that was\\", which hints something rather drastic happened here in this universe's past, and when we first see it, it's in the aftermath of a civil war, between a centralised Alliance and a number of other worlds who want independence (the brownshirts), and in which the Alliance has won.  The captain of Serenity, Capt. Malcolm Reynolds (Nathan Fillion, who played the evil expriest Caleb in Buffy Season 7), and his friend and second in command Zoe Warren (Gina Torres, who played the evil Jasmin in Angel Season 4), both fought in this war on the losing brownshirt side.  Other crew members are Wash (Zoe's husband and the pilot), Jayne a mercenary employed as the ships muscle, and Kaylee the ship's engineer, as well as the 'companion' Inara, a very high class prostitute who rents on of the ship's shuttles (in this world this class of 'companion' is an honorable profession, more like a courtesan, and Inara was initially taken on board the ship to give them openings to high society). <br /> <br />The series starts as the ship takes on board some passengers including Shepard (sort of a priest) Book and a doctor called Simon Tam, to raise some money to keep the ship going (they are always rather hard up for money).  I won't spoil anything by going into what happens, (you'll just have to get hold of the DVD's), though Simon's sister River (Summer Glau, who played the balerina in an episode of Season 3 Angel) plays an increasingly important part Anyway the first episode is a great introductory story, and all in all I recommend Firefly to anyone who likes Sci-fi, westerns or just a good story.  On this basis I can't wait for the film Serenity, when it comes out in 2005. <br /> <br />5 / 5
B00005JKNC|4.0|This film is entertaining and harmless; simple feel-good stuff. Its best features are the soundtrack (awesome boogie-woogie piano and big-band clarinet!) and the cameo appearance of B-movie demi-god Bruce Campbell in the movie-within-a-movie role of an \\"Intrepid Explorer\\".  Worth a rental; buy the soundtrack.
B0002VKZL6|4.0|This album really grows on you!  Excellent musicianship and  <br />songwriting at its best.  I am fully convinced that Mark is one of the best songwriters out there and can really connect with an audience.... Yes, the best songs are the ones with the heavier edge.  Maybe Mark will rock out more on the next album.  <br /> <br />Tracks of note:  Boom like that (should do well on the radio), trawlerman, postcards from paraguay.
0380789019|5.0|I am an avid reader of everything I can get my hands on and of all things that I have read in the past few years Neil Gaiman's Neverwhere has been one of the greatest. The story is rich in detail and story maintaining a great literary presence throughout. This is a book that like the character Richard Mayhew makes you fall through the cracks and never want to put the book down until you have read to the point where you catch every tiny detail within the book. i highly recommend this book to anybody who has lost faith in the publishing world and is looking to rekindle that fire.
B0002XVQNU|4.0|I too really love the original theatrical release and bought the 2-disc edition awhile back.  I do generally have an aversion to Hollywood marketing ploys, but from what I heard Mark Steven Johnson on his commentary from the previous release, they were really crunched on time during the production, especially with some of the CG stuff.  They also battled quite a bit with the MPAA to keep their PG-13 rating.  (It's difficult to be true to the darkness in the comic book series while marketing it for the most optimum revenue returns.)  Hopefully, they've taken the time to sensically incorporate the extra fight footage into the story and brush up on a few of the painful CG shots (amidst many good ones).  Marketing ploys aside, I think there's added pressure for directors these days to \\"get the product out the door\\" that they have to make various artistic compromises ( la LOTR).  I really do hope that this DVD was made for Johnson to \\"complete his original vision\\" for an already good film!
B0002OERI0|5.0|Green Day has been one of my favorite band of all time. I have loved them since Kerplunk came out. If it wasn't for Billie Joe, Tre Cool, and Mike Dirnt, I wouldn't like the music that I like today. Every album after Dookie was good, just not as good as the Dookie itself.. Warning wasn't bad, but didn't give me the Green Day vibe that I like ever so much. American Idiot was a concept album that I heard  they were coming out with, and had a feeling they were going to do something different this time. Following the typical pattern of other rock operas, they have songs flowing right through one another. With all these songs together, it's like a collaboration between all their previous album. I am a diehard Green Day fan and can honestly tell you this is their best thus far.
B0002XDOBC|3.0|\\"Disraeli Gears\\" is one of the best rock albums.  However, this two-disc \\"expanded edition\\" offers very little in the way of previously unreleased material.<br /><br />What's on it?  First, naturally, is the original album.  Disc one is filled out with a take of \\"Lawdy Mama\\" (previously issued on \\"Live Cream\\" and the \\"Those Were the Days\\" boxed set); a previously unreleased take of \\"Blue Condition\\" with Clapton singing lead, and five demo songs, all of which appear on the box set.  Disc Two features the mono version of the original album, along with mono versions of \\"Lawdy Mama\\" and the alternate version of \\"Blue Condition\\", and adds nine selections from the BBC Recordings (in mono), all of which appear on the \\"BBC Sessions\\" disc.<br /><br />If you own the box set and the \\"BBC Sessions\\", all you'll get by purchasing this edition is the mono mix of \\"Disraeli Gears\\", and mono and stereo versions of the alternate \\"Blue Condition.\\"  Oh, and you get a nice booklet along with some snazzy new photos.  Hard-core fans probably have the previously issued material, making this a rather pricey investment.  Casual fans will be satisfied with the far less spendy original album.<br /><br />OK, so I bought it.  Yes, I'm one of those hard-core Cream fans who has to have every note they played.  I'm actually interested in listening to the mono mix.  But most people don't need to go that far.  The most recent remaster of the single-disc original is all you really need.
B00005JMUA|2.0|Wha' Happened?!? <br /> <br />Kill Bill Vol. 1 was SUCH a great film; action-packed, thrilling, inventive, sexy and funny. <br /> <br />Kill Bill Vol. 2, on the other hand, is a bore. Tedious and childish. From the first few seconds, when Uma overacts a monologue rehashing of Vol. 1, through two dull but bloody hours right up until David Carradine's half-asleep pseudo-philosophical ramblings, there is nothing of real interest here. <br /> <br />What a let down.
B0002OERI0|4.0|But this one hooked me! <br /> <br />I don't know what it is, but this is one kick ass album that I can't stop playing over and over again, and all of the tunes are so f'n catchy. <br /> <br />I say, buy it, it's aiming to please, and it does, there's something on it for just about everyone.
B00020HEL6|5.0|This is an incredible album and Renee has an amazing voice. I've shared this CD with countless friends and family and everyone loves it.  I of course don't tell them the singer is 14 until after they've heard a song or two.  Then they're always totally floored.  I'm a Norah Jones fan and I've listened to Diana Krall and Jane Monheit and although Renee isn't writing her own music, so she can't claim the artistic credit of the aforementioned, I do find her voice to be my favorite. There's a sweetness and openess to it that I really like. Being a self prescribed audiophile and home theater enthusiast, I love music that has great dynamic range and detail. Renee's voice comes through with so much detail, range and clarity on this CD that she sounds like she's singing right before me. And the band sounds just as incredible, from the deep bass guitar notes to the crisp trumpets, this CD is perfect demo material to show off your audio system. Tracks 2,4,6 are my favorites.<br /><br />1. Summertime - A nice opener, shows off some of her range right off the bat. The song changes tempo drastically midway, from a slow, quiet song, into a peppy, swing type song and her singing goes from sultry to playfully energetic.<br /><br />2. Taking a Chance On Love - This is my favorite song on the CD. Great vocals, great lyrics, very smooth, just sounds awesome.<br /><br />3. Is You Is or Is You Ain't My Baby - This is a pretty good song, has an older sound to it.<br /><br />4. Someone to Watch Over Me - Another one of my favorites. This is probably the softest and slowest song on the CD. The focus is entirely on her singing and it spotlights the wonderful sound and detail in her voice. Doesn't push her vocal range much, but it does show her voice's flexibility.<br /><br />5. Breaking Up Is Hard To Do - Sure it's a little sappy, but it's a nice duet. The male singer's voice and Renee's compliment each other well while also highlighting the sweetness of her voice in contrast to the guy's.<br /><br />6. A Love That Will Last - I think this is the one original song on this album, written by David Foster. Excellent song, smooth and easy, though it doesn't stretch Renee's vocal range as much, the lyrics are really creative and romantic.<br /><br />7. Meet Me, Midnight - A nice big band sound, very soulful.<br /><br />8. Sunday Kind of Love - A simple song, good but not stellar.<br /><br />9. On a Slow Boat to China - The shortest song on the CD. Smooth and simple beat. Nothing that dramatic though.<br /><br />10. What a Difference a Day Makes - A nice reprise, felt a little too slow and drawn out though. But still, her singing is beautiful.<br /><br />11. Midnight At the Oasis - Decent song, found the tempo and singing to be a bit flat though, not very rousing.<br /><br />12. Sentimental Journey - An OK song, but probably my least fave on the album. Just nothing that special about it, though there's decent vocal highs and lows.<br /><br />I highly recommend this CD and look forward to Renee's continued success.he guy's. <br /> <br />6. A Love That Will Last - I think this is the one original song on this album, written by David Foster. Excellent song, smooth and easy, though it doesn't stretch Renee's vocal range as much, the lyrics are really creative and romantic. <br /> <br />7. Meet Me, Midnight - A nice big band sound, very soulful. <br /> <br />8. Sunday Kind of Love - A simple song, good but not stellar. <br /> <br />9. On a Slow Boat to China - The shortest song on the CD. Smooth and simple beat. Nothing that dramatic though. <br /> <br />10. What a Difference a Day Makes - A nice reprise, felt a little too slow and drawn out though. But still, her singing is beautiful. <br /> <br />11. Midnight At the Oasis - Decent song, found the tempo and singing to be a bit flat though, not very rousing. <br /> <br />12. Sentimental Journey - An OK song, but probably my least fave on the album. Just nothing that special about it, though there's decent vocal highs and lows. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this CD and look forward to Renee's continued success.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I love Star Wars.  I *love* Star Wars.  But this isn't the Star Wars I remember.  Hayden Christensen is *not* supposed to be standing next to Alec Guiness at the end of Return of the Jedi.  And the horribly intrusive and distracting additions made in the 90's feel even more glaring in this release.<br /><br />I bought my videos before the release of the remastered (with extra scenes) videos, and that's what I'll be watching.  *Not* these DVDs.
B00005JMUA|5.0|I thought Vol. 2 was a lot more developed than the first release. Vol. 1 was very fast paced and action packed, and definitely Tarantino Style. Vol. 2 slowed things down a bit, it gave you more than just action sequence filler. I like where the story went, the questions that were answered and it still included action sequences that meshed well with Vol. 1. If you weren't into the 'gore' of the first Volume, this provides a mellower approach.  <br /> <br />And I though it was pretty slick when The Bride took Elle Driver's eye out.  <br />
B00005JMU2|5.0|This is a great movie, dealing with a girl who is trying to be her own person. It stays on topic. It doesn't get lost in the sub-plots. I hope there is a First Daughter 2!
B000002UW1|5.0|Document is REM's finest. Regardless of the politics in some of the songs, they are of the highest accolades that all the songs gell together. Two songs I enjoyed the most were The One I love and It's the end of the world as we know it.<br /><br />Can't wait till REM come to sydney, I will for sure see them in concert if they ever do. For any serious REM fan.
B00006CXSS|5.0|What can you say about one of the most definitive depictions of World War II's European theater to be found anywhere?<br /><br />Drop $90, soldier, and buy it!<br /><br />Band of Brothers is a must-own set of DVDs that is eminently watchable and re-watchable. In a brilliant adaptation of Stephen Ambrose's book, we follow the exploits of the 101st Airborne Division's Easy Company from training, through D-Day and until the end of the war. The writing, direction, special effects and acting are all first rate, giving the viewer a battalion-full of real characters to identify with.<br /><br />The series honors the ordinary heroics of the soldiers it depicts without romanticizing them. It honestly depicts the horror, terror, suffering and randomness of war. The camera work puts you right in the action, and the dialog is realistic and unromantic. You can practically smell the sweat, terror and resignation.<br /><br />Critics who complain that we don't get to know the men of the company miss the point; in war (unlike the movies) you don't get to keep your favorite buddies until a propitious pause in the action. The DVD shows how even these minor characters were well-limned and authentic.<br /><br />The special feature of the making of the series was also fascinating, showing how some of the film's special effects were accomplished. There's also a pretty cool look at the actor 'Boot Camp' narrated by Ron Livingston, who played Lt. Nixon.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B000002MU3|4.0|In this album release, REM distanced themselves from the pop/jangle sounds and concentrated on a more rock feel and sound. The experimentation was successful and REM re-emerged as a serious rock band in this CD.<br /><br />I for one, enjoyed this style of REM over previous albums because I am more of a rock band. Some great songs, not hits, but well worth spinning this CD in the player.
0440180295|5.0|At times, people may focus too strongly on this book being Anti-War. As I see it and taken with regard to other Vonnegut books - as well as anti-war, this book uses the far-fetched aliens and becoming \\"unstuck\\" in time for perspective, allegory and a position to critize society. The themes behind the book are deeper than just anti-war, but extend to the themes that dominate mankind. Do we shape our futures and our lives or are they shaped for us? Can we prevent the atrocities we place on one another (like Dresden) or is it inevitable? As when a Tralfamadorian (alien) tells Billy that, \\"I've visited thirty one inhabited planets in the Universe... and only on Earth is there any talk of free will.\\"<br /><br />This book explorers more than just the pain of a war surviror and the tragedy of those that didn't survive. It is comment on life (fatalism, free will, cosmic purpose or the big empty?), people (and our tendencies toward self-interest and self-destruction) and thereby god and the universe. Sometimes we miss the forest for the trees... but don't miss reading Vonnegut. If not this book, then Cat's Cradle or Sirens of Titan - all are exceptional and worth your time and money.
B000001FDK|5.0|Let's just say that Summer nights, Hopelessly devoted to you, You're the one that I want, Sandy, Greased Lightnin', Look at me I'm Sandra Dee, Blue Moon and We go together are on this CD... :)
038533348X|5.0|\\"All of the true things I am about to tell you are shameless lies..\\"<br /><br />As with other Vonnegut books (like the Sirens of Titan), a far-fetched plot takes the reader through what may, at a first and distanced glance, be a fun science fiction story. But the use of a surreal and fanciful story is for the purpose of perspective and comment on what we as people tend toward in life. Through satire, we can see man's self-destructive tendencies and our desire for purpose to the extent that we are happier believing in lies than accepting what may be a truth of meaninglessness. Thus, the cat's cradle - a meaningless game with no cat and no cradle - just a bunch of X's in string. The characters and story line are entertaining, even if you wish to ignore the social, religious and political comment. Though to me, the message laced in the story is what makes this book outstanding. For those unfamiliar with Vonnegut, the Cat's Cradle and Sirens of Titans are were I recommend you begin...
B00004ZB9D|5.0|Greatest Hits CDs don't always reunite the artists' best songs. Lenny Kravitz's does actually contain quite a good selection of his songs. From his upbeat rock tunes ( \\"Are you gonna go my way\\", \\"American woman\\" ) to some his ballads ( \\"Can't get you off my mind\\" or the beautiful \\"Stand by my woman\\" ), these songs showcase Lenny's artistry quite well. Of course, nothing replaces the full \\"Let love rule\\", \\"Mama said\\" or \\"5\\" albums, but to a Lenny-newcomer, this can give you a good idea of his work. Other great tracks on this : \\"Fly away\\", \\"Again\\", \\"Let love rule\\" and \\"It ain't over 'til it's over\\"
0142004235|4.0|Personally, I consider it to be the best work of Steinbeck. It is well-written, moves along well (with the exception of a few passages) and builds up characters (for the most part). It's not a perfect read, not a horrible one - but a good book. I can't say that about a vast majority of books.<br /><br />The themes behind the book are far reaching and as old as any story's. Good verus evil, free will, and what truth is or can be. The use of Cain, Abel, and Timshell are laced in the idea of sin. There are characters and ideas that are quite good in nature and being, and those that are nearly pure evil. The outcome is a bit predictable and smacks of popular religion. The contrasts may be overdone and the characters a little too foreseeable, but it makes for a good read - and isn't that the point afterall...
B00005JNEI|1.0|THIS MOVIE SUCKS!! it only points out the downfalls of a tried and trouble four year term.  Not only that, but it lies!!! all of what it communicates is not proven AT ALL and is not truth.  this movie is a ATTACK made on the President of the United States of America.  support the U.S., support democracy, support your chosen leader!!!! don't buy this, it wastes your valuable money. thank you for your time. god's blessings.
B00003RQNJ|4.0|This film, even though it's script by William Goldman won an Oscar, is more dialogue driven than story driven.  It doesn't even feel like a conventional western, just like a couple of guys joking their way through the remnants of the old west.  What elevates this film is the chemistry between Newman and Redford.  Butch(Newman), as one character describes him, is an affable fellow.  This is a good contrast to the moodier Sundance(Redford).  At this point in time Newman had already cemented his legend.  Redford had more to gain from this partnership than Newman did.  Redford, who is something of a stiff as an actor, gained alot from the influence of Newman.  This partnership was put to better use in \\"The Sting\\" where the characters and story were better developed and was also directed by George Roy Hill.  Katherine Ross gives a passable performance as Etta Place, Sundance's girlfriend.  Strother Martin, one of the greatest character actors of all time, appears here in a funny bit as a mine boss.  The cinematography by Conrad Hall is excellent.  On the minus side, some of Hill's artistic devices are annoying(i.e. the opening sepia shots, the still photo montage for the trip to Bolivia, even the closing freeze frame).  I cannot emphasize how abysmal the score and songs by Burt Bacharach and Hal David are.  You do not so much retain them to memory but struggle to forget them.  The commentary track on this DVD can be passed on.  Generally I like it when the original artists participate on a commentary but in this case director Hill, Hall, etc. don't seem to be adding anything relevant to the action on screen.  Unfortunately, these gentlemen were getting up in years and their commentary just seemed doddering.
B0002O7XW2|4.0|I am soooo happy to see this finally released on DVD the right way.It is currently available on DVD and has been for some time now but that dvd was obviously rushed into production as there was one big thing missing.Special Features.This is one movie I want as much special fetures as possible and you'll get them with this new realese they are <br /> <br />Featurette's <br /> <br />Christine,Fast and Furious <br />Christine,Finish Line <br />Christine,Ignition <br /> <br />there will also be a photo galery and deleted scenes.The only thing I am disspaointed about is they still have not released the trailer wich has kept his from being a 5 star rating
B0001YRVN4|5.0|Just received an viewed this trilogy plus bonus disc.  Are there flaws in the transfer - yes.  Are there some significant changes to the original and special edition - yes.  Does it matter - NO!!!  This set makes me want to go out an spend about $5000 on a new widescreen hi def tv and surroud sound.  Never have the triolgies looked more beautiful or sounded so magestic.  You can wax poetic about all the minutia regarding aspect ratios, sound artifacts, transfer rates, etc...  The plain truth is, if you love these movies, you'll love seeing them in DVD format.  Just like the commercial says - see it again, for the first time. <br /> <br />
020530902X|5.0|Attitude? The only attitude found in this book is an undying sympathy for the poor reader. In an age when books are pumped out faster than one can read them, THE ELEMENTS OF STYLE is needed more than ever. ELEMENTS is not a grammar book? Hmm. I must've missed part 1, \\"The Elementary Rules of Usage.\\" The fact is, you'll be hard pressed to find a publisher or a professional writer anywhere who does not give this book a whole-hearted endorsement. I've been a writer for 27 years and in all that time THE ELEMENTS OF STYLE has been at the top of every \\"must have\\" list of books for writers. Buy it. Read it. And read it often!
B00004TDTO|5.0|It's interesting to watch how the career of Steven Spielberg, arguably the greatest director working today, has evolved.  In his second feature film, Spielberg seems to have taken his cues from the master, Alfred Hitchcock, most notably \\"The Birds\\".  On what was probably a limited budget and limited technology of the time, Spielberg elicits enough scares to put today's CGI driven film-makers to shame.  Spielberg utilizes cinematography, film-editing, and most effectively a great John Williams score to maximum effect.  Spielberg was also blessed with the perfect cast in Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfus.  Murray Hamilton even gives a good performance as the mayor who would sacrifice vacationers for the all-mighty dollar.  One of the more effective scenes in the film is the one where Robert Shaw as Quint, the shark-hunter, relates the story of the crew of the U.S.S. Indianapolis.  I never read the book on which this was based but it was my understanding that it was kind of trashy.  If that's the case then Spielberg has elevated trash into gold.
0060925000|4.0|The only complaint I have about this book was Seth's frequent use of incorrect pronoun case, particualrly in the comparative (i.e., \\"older than me\\"); that's something that just grates on my nerves and (at least temporarily) spoils my enjoyment of his writing. I constantly find that sort of thing in translations, for some reason, but I presume that Seth wrote this book in English, so I'm at a loss as to why he would commit such blatant errors. I've read a few of his other books, namely \\"From Heaven Lake\\" and \\"The Golden Gate\\", both of which I loved; however, it's been many years since I read them and I honestly don't remember if he made such errors in those books. As a matter of fact, it's been about 10 years since I read \\"A Suitable Boy\\", so obviously the grammatical errors were enough to create a lasting impression on me. Apart from that, I think it's a wonderful book.
B00003CXB7|4.0|Though I do not agree with the politics of director Robert Altman, I am a great admirer of his artistry and most of all the independence of his from the cookie-cutter style of film-making that is prevalent in Hollywood.  Though he's hit more singles than homeruns, his films are rarely un-interesting.  One of the few times that he tackled a studio product, \\"Popeye\\", he made it seem like an independent film.  Those not familiar with the theme of this film or the long-running TV series based on this film, it involves the hi-jinks of a group of army surgeons during the Korean War trying to cope with the horrors that surround them.  This film does not so much have a story but a series of comic vignettes (the shower scene, the football game, etc.)  These comic episodes are effectively juxtaposed with the operating room scenes that illustrate why these surgeons have to engage in such outrageous behaviour; if they weren't laughing, they'd be crying.  Altman gathers an impressive cast here, many making their film debuts.  Donald Sutherland as Hawkeye, Elliott Gould as Trapper John, and Sally Kellerman as Hotlips are effectively funny in the leading roles.  Altman gives an excellent commentary here as he has done on other DVDs.  Altman states in his comments his distaste for the TV series that spun-off from this film.  I echo the same sentiment because I found that show pompous and sanctimonious.  I would have granted this film 5 stars but I dock it one because I find the suicide scene that parodies the last supper to be extremely offensive to my sensibilities.
0380713802|4.0|Bryson might be the funniest travel writer around. He is also very informative. This is one of his early books, he has not yet really found his style. <br />Mr. Bryson travels through continental Europe. His journey has two purposes: he wants to write about Europe, and he wants to relieve a journey he made in his youth with, the by now infamous, Katz. His inner journey is a middle-aged man trying to remember his youth, even if you sometimes wonder if he has really grown out of it! His outer journey lets him experience the feel of all the places he visits. That is by far the best aspect of the book! Here he is no-holds barred funny! He can pinpoint the national bad habits of every country he visits. Since he also lets us know about his own bad habits it is not insulting. There is a love and a respect hidden among all his writings. He loves travelling, and he loves all places he visits. He seems to have a nack for capturing the soul of the places he visits. His books can almost be used as travel guides.
B00004X0ER|5.0|Many rock bands nowadays are so self-absorbed and whiny that a nice slap in the face to the world of popular music has been long overdue.  The Hives do just that except they do it continuously.  Only once in the 28 minutes of Veni Vidi Vicious do they slow their thrashing onslaught of guitars.  Their everything-in-the-red sound hearkens back to the glory days of bands like Iggy and The Stooges and in a most glorious fashion.  The screach of Howlin' Pele Almqvist makes all the difference on a release like this because without a great frontman it wouldn't be as easy to love this band.  As it is, The Hives have given the world something new by introducing the masses to a sound that should have received more exposure than it did.  Every song on this album grabs you and never lets you go with hooks so relentless it seems near impossible.  The only misstep on the whole thing is the mediocre \\"Find Another Girl\\" but even that can't ruin the whole experience.  Veni Vidi Vicious is a great CD that came out at just the right time so all parties involved could benefit from its greatness.
B000002LOE|5.0|REM discovered their true selves with this album. REM left the experimentation behind and fused themselves into the rock culture that they'd soon be famed for. Losing my Religion, Shiny Happy People, Country Feedback and Half a World Away are the best songs from this album and have become some of my favourites all time from all of REM's collections.<br /><br />For any REM fan, they will find this album so much fun to listen too and enjoy its smooth rock sounds and great riffs.
B00002ND77|5.0|In my opinion - and I know many may disagree - 'Malcolm X' depicts the best acting Denzel Washington has ever given in any movie. Starring as the late Afro-American leader, Denzel almost perfectly embodies the early thuggish ways of Malcolm Little during his life of crime, and his born-again, revolution-poised personality that grew out of his embracing Islam and reading while in prison. Scenes such as the 'Plymouth Rock landed on us' and the 'American right-wing' speeches, the 'chicken comin' home to roost' press conference after Kennedy's assassination, and the pilgrimage to Mecca shows how well Denzel played his part.  <br />  In general, the movie features an excellent cast of characters, such as Spike Lee (director) as shorty, Malcolm's partner in crime,  Angela Basset (superb acting, by the way) as Betty Shabbaz, Malcolm's wife, and Al Freeman, who does a terrific job emulating the clipped, choppy speech of the real Elijah Muhammed.   <br />          <br />There were, however, some factual holes in the movie that either Spike Lee weeded out for ethical reasons or were a bit distorted for the sake of sticking to Hollywood-thriller standards. For example, the character of brother Baines (Albert Hall), who first introduces Malcolm to Islam and later turns against him, is ficticious. However, the person most closely associated with Baines in real life would be reverend Louis Farrakkan, who had been a rival to Malcolm X and nowadays leads the Nation of Islam. So to allude directly to Farrakkan would be somehow indicting or at least especulating as to identify the person behind Malcolm's demise. For this one I can understand why Lee chose a more subtle approach.      <br />Another example is Malcolm's upbringing to radical, Black nationalist politics. Lee's sort of gives a hint to Malcolm's influences from Marcus Garvey, only after the movie makes a short mention of it when Malcolm recalls his childhood and narrates passages of his father's preachings and defiance ofthe Ku Klux Klan. However, Lee does not focus on other literature and people, besides the Koran and Elijah Muhammed, from where Malcolm drew most of his political beliefs. <br /> <br />But that aside, the movie is good enough to educate the audience  about the life of this great revolutionary. The plot is very well-crafted, the acting is outstanding, and the short narrative with real takes of Malcolm X that ends with Nelson Mandela's   reflection at a elementary school classroom is just terrific for a golden finale. <br /> <br />I recommend this movie to get you started on Malcolm  X  and his ideas, but after you see it, get the autobiography, his definite, ever-lasting legacy as told by the man himself.          <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000VAFO0|4.0|I am fan of vampire movies, well done of course. I found the plot to be interesting and the characters well fleshed out. It must the year of strong female characters, Kill Bill movies, Underworld, and Resident Evil: Apocalypse. I know not all will love the film, in fact some may hate it. It is subjective like all forms of entertainment. You won't know until you see it.  I say it is worth a look, who knows you might love the movie as much as some us did or you might hate it like some of the others, but see it for yourself and decide. It's worth a rental.
B00008G9JM|5.0|This is hands down, the most progressive album by Jethro Tull and was certainly very controversial upon its release.  Ian took the criticism of A Passion Play fairly hard, which may have resulted in the release of the much simpler material on Warchild (1974).  At any rate, this is my favorite album by the band and nearly wore the album out.<br /><br />The lineup on A Passion Play included Ian Anderson (flute, acoustic guitar, saxophone, vocals); the amazing Barriemore Barlow (drums and percussion); Martin Barre (electric guitar); Jeffrey Hammond (bass guitar and vocals); and John Evan (piano, Hammond organ, synthesizers, speech on \\"The Hare who lost his Spectacles\\").<br /><br />Although musically similar to Thick as a Brick (yet thematically distinct), the hard-rock guitar lines are absent on A Passion Play, having been replaced by acoustic guitar and warmer-toned electric guitar, arrangements are more intricate, melodies more developed, and the rhythmic complexity is just unbelievable. With regard to synthesizers (which are abundant throughout), the middle section of A Passion Play is particularly outstanding, where just muted acoustic guitars and softly pulsing synthesizers can be heard. It is also the heightened level of contrast on \\"A Passion Play\\" that makes this music so incredibly interesting. From the intricate introduction, through the children's tale \\"The Hare who lost his Spectacles\\" (narrated by the keyboard player), and back into the main themes, A Passion Play is a study in dynamics, and both emotional and textural variation.<br /><br />The remastering on this is excellent and features loads of liner notes, lyrics and photos.  The sound quality is excellent.<br /><br />This album is very highly recommended along with Stand Up (1969), Thick as a Brick (1972); Minstrel in the Gallery (1973), and Songs From the Wood (1977).
B0002KVUKM|1.0|After seeing Kate Beckinsdale in Underworld, and Hugh Jackman as Wolverine in the X-Men movies, I went to this film with bright optimism.  I even enjoyed the Mummy movies, so I thought this movie with it's stars and budget couldn't fail, but boy was I wrong. <br /> <br />The movies started out inspiringly with Van Helsing chasing after Hyde.  The movie has so many plot holes.  If the only thing that can kill Dracula is a werewolf, why keep one around. I mean he's invicible, so why does he need an overgrown german shepard.  Also, what's with the eggs.  I mean talk about taking liberties with a legendary figure such as Dracula.  Vampires don't have children, by definition once you become a vampire, you stop aging. So what's the point of having little baby vampires.  Although these things didn't look remotely human at all. They had to pay Jackman and Beckinsdale so much money that they couldn't afford a decent actor for Dracula.  I mean the guy was absolutely terrible.  A good villain is almost more important to a movie than the hero, for example, The Mummy had a good villain, Die Hard had a good villain, Kill Bill had good villains, you get the idea. The movie really lost me when Van Helsing pulls out his automatic crossbow with an infinite amount of bolts.  The movie takes place during a time when people are still using swords.  That weapon doesn't even exist today. <br /> <br />I could go on and on about the shortcomings about this movie but I think I am wasting my time. I went with my friends niece who is 14 and she loved this film and hated Spiderman 2. There in lies the difference between those who love this movie and those who hate this movie. Spiderman 2 had a good story, character development, emotional depth, and good acting to go along with the action sequences.  Van Halsing had just the latter, action, action, action, action and more action without any substance. If you are young and just want some mindless fun, than you might enjoy this movie.  If you likeyour action movies with some substance, rent X-men 2, or wait for Spiderman 2. <br /> <br />Also, they might show this movie at film school on how not to waste 150 million dollars.
B000077VR3|5.0|An English writer sets out for Paris to write, and to find love.  When he arrives, he goes to a night club, and gets both.  First, he find the love of his life... Satine; the head courtesan and entertainer.  Then, from his love and experiences with her, Christian gets the story of a lifetime.  That story, is called Moulin Rouge, named after the night club where he and Satine met. <br />I don't think a movie could be better.  Moulin Rouge would get three thumbs up... if any of us had three thumbs...  First, the cast is made up of a long list of great actors, such as Ewan McGregor (Christian), Nicole Kidman (Satine), Jim Broadbent (Zidler), Richard Roxbourgh (Duke), and so many more.  Aside from the great acting, there is also great music.  (See soundtracks 1 & 2).  There are many remakes and compilations of old songs in the movie, such as Lady Marmalade, Your Song, and Roxanne.  Other spectacular things about Moulin Rouge are the staging, the costuming, and all the work that was put into making the movie, because it shows. <br />Some people think this movie was a bust, and that they walked out of the theatre 15 minutes after the movie started. THAT'S a problem.  The movie gets off to a slightly rough start, and if you don't give up right away, the movie picks up, and picks up really well. <br />The romantic, musical love story, Moulin Rouge is at the top of my list and will be on yours as well.  Go rent the movie.  Then buy it.  And the CD.  You won't regret it.
B0000X61XM|5.0|The alien saga is perhaps the best sci-fi horror saga ever made i love all 4 movies and the alternate cuts of the movies are good the extended version of Aliens is specifically brilliant. This box set is well worth the price as it is packed full of excellent bonus material apart from 2 different cuts of each movie.
0451191153|4.0|I read The Fountainhead last year for a high school English class. I wasn't really expecting to like it going in, mainly because it was a pretty long book, and I had heard it was boring. I'm glad that the class required me to read it, because I think it is one of the best books I've ever read in my life. I'm not really one of those people who reads for fun, but this is the kind of book that I would recommend reading, even if it's not for a class. Normally I look at reading as a chore, but this book was different. It held my attention, which many books can't do.  I was very impressed by this book, and I would highly recommend it to other readers.  <br /> Ayn Rand, the author of this book, did an outstanding job. Her characters are amazing, and the plot that goes along with them is equally as good. She has all the necessary aspects that make a great book, in my opinion. The story is great, the characters are great, and the book is great. It takes the reader through twists and turns through the lives of the characters. I never found it to be boring or dull in any way. I'm not a \\"book person\\", but I really did enjoy reading this book. It had a big impact on me and most definitely changed the way that I thought. As I was reading it I remember thinking about how it related to me, and to today's society. I think that there is a lot that can be learned from this book. We shouldn't just believe what we are told, or believe everything we see. After reading this book I didn't want to be just another follower and do what I was told. It made me want to be more of individual and break free of society's \\"rules\\". I think that there is a lot to be learned from this book.  <br /> The Fountainhead is set back in the 1920's and 30's in New York City. It's a book about a man, Howard Roark, who is an architect. Roark is an idealistic, almost free spirit who goes against the norm. On the other hand, Peter Keating, another big character in the story, is pretty much the opposite of Roark. Keating goes by the rules, and does what society dictates. The book focuses on Roark's struggles on making it as an architect, more or less. It also deals with Keating and Roark's lives, and how their paths cross in and out of each other.  <br />The book starts out with Roark and Keating while they are attending the Stanton Institute of Technology. Keating's mother runs a boardinghouse, where Roark lives. Roark is kicked out of Stanton, mainly because he refuses to design how others want him to. Keating on the other hand dishes out exactly what is wanted. They are pretty much opposite ends of the spectrum. Roark's work is creative and controversial, and not accepted. The book shows the differences between these two characters, and their ideals. <br /> This book also contains a philosophy of life. Her philosophy is known as objectivism. Two of the major characters, Peter Keating and Howard Roark, represent two different ideals of life. Peter Keating is the follower, who just goes along with society. He seems to be a good guy in the beginning, but you'll have to decide for yourself in the end. Roark is the individualistic, free spirit who rebels against society.  Roark is the basis for objectivism, in my opinion. The book isn't anywhere near as simple as I've explained it. Buy the book and figure it all out. In my opinion we have way too many \\"Peter Keating's\\" in the world today, and this book open my eyes to that. After reading this I no longer wanted to be a \\"Peter Keating\\", and I've tried not to be since. This is a great book with a great outlook on life. I don't think you'll be disappointed by it at all.  <br />

BY THE TIME THIS ALBUM CAME AROUND, VAN HALEN WAS STILL SELLING ALBUMS, BUT THE QUALITY OF VAN HALEN'S MUSIC HAD WENT DOWN. AND TO THIS DAY, THIS BAND IS STILL DOING SUB-PAR MUSIC. THE ALBUM, LIKE EVERY OTHER VAN HALEN ALBUM THAT DIDN'T FEATURE DAVID LEE ROTH AS THE SINGER, SUFFERS FROM SAMMY HAGAR'S AWFUL SINGING. BUT, ''FINISH WHAT YA STARTED'' AND ''SOURCE OF INFECTION'' ARE EASILY THE BEST SONGS ON THIS ALBUM AND THEY'RE QUITE CATCHY. BUT, MUCH OF THE REST OF THIS ALBUM IS BORING. THE MORE VAN HALEN WENT ON WITHOUT DAVID LEE ROTH, THE WORSE THEIR MUSIC GOT. IF THIS BAND WERE SMART, THEY WOULD GET RID OF HAGAR AND PERSUADE DAVID LEE ROTH TO SING FOR THEM AGAIN. SAD TO SAY, BUT VAN HALEN'S BEST DAYS ARE WAY BEHIND THEM. GO PICK UP A VAN HALEN ALBUM THAT HAS DAVID LEE ROTH OR PICK UP ONE OF DAVID LEE ROTH'S SOLO ALBUMS FROM THE 80S. THIS ALBUM ISN'T WORTH THE MONEY.

B0002UXBD6|5.0|Ah Green Day.  Never do they fail to amaze me.  They had a span of great albums in the 90's starting with Dookie and continuing to Nimrod.  Then the new millenium comes and Green Day seemingly sell out with the pop album Warning.  After that album, any fan with sanity lost faith in them.  They disappeared for a few years, sporatically toured and then in the summer of 04, bam.  They came back from the dead.  I was driving in my car one day and American Idiot comes on the radio.  Not only did I have renewed faith in Green Day but I was willing to now buy anythin they put out.  And so comes American Idiot (the album) <br /> <br />To do a track by track listing would be blasphemy so I'll give you all the rundown of the highlights.  American Idiot starts it off strong with politically charged lyrics but for some reasson sounds out of place on this album.  Every other song fits into the story if you read the lyrics but this song jsut doesnt.  It's irrelevant though because the song rocks the house.  This is followed by the best song rather song(s) on the album.  Jesus of Suburbia is a nine minute barn burner that showcases the bands best strengths from introspective soft moments such as Section V Tales of a Broken Home to scathing ass kicking punk liek essentially every other part of the song.  The song has a brief guitar solo as well as a cookass drumming showoff to bridge the gap between the first two parts.  There's also the coolest bass playing on the album on this song.  This leads into the cool funky Holiday which too rocks the house and essentially melds into the following song so much so that they should have been made one song.  Boulevard of Broken Dreams is your first ballady song that still manages to rock out in the chorus.  Has a cool wah wah induced crazy guitar solo going on at the end of it.  Are We The Waiting.  Cool song.  Interesting music hall type chorus.  Cool song to listen to but avoid listening to it more than once in a week because it will heavily annoy you.  It's ST. JIMMY time!!!  This song sounds liek an outtake from Dookie except the lyrics are far better.  This brings a real hard edge to the album just as you might think its slipping into Warning esque balladry.  Give Me Novacaine's a cool song with rocking guitar work in the bridge.  Might I add at this point as a side note that Billie Joe finally sounds liek he's trying to step outside playing simple power chords and flirting with the idea of soloing.  The solos he does are cool and really lend themselves to the songs without taking over control and choking the life out of the songs.  Now where was I.  Ah yes She's A Rebel.  This song kinda tracks onto the end of Give Me Novocaine and yet again sounds like an amazing Dookie outtake updated for this new millenium.  Then comes the Latin tinged Extraordinary Girl.  This song is cool and interesting to listen to mostly because it shows yet another side of Green Day that they manage to show well on this album without sounding crappy.  Letterbomb is next and after a cool intro with some chick talking it rocks the house.  This is followed by the big epic ballad of the album that is Wake Me Up When September Ends.  This song is amazing.  Lyrics.  Perfect.  Instrumentation.  Perfect.  Everything in general.  Near perfect.  This song stars out slow and ballady and slowly builds into a real almost dare I say power ballad complete with Billie Joe's best solo on the album.  Then comes what i call a disappointment.  Homecoming.  Sorry guys Jesus of Suburbia rocked but this song is flawed majorly.  Sure its got five parts again but it doesnt move as well seems to drag on a wee bit and the songs mostly aren't even songs but rather interludes for the next interlude.  Disappointment.  Nuff said.  The album winds down well though with Watsername.  The song rounds the album out well and incorporates both hard and softness into 4 minutes that end this album well. <br /> <br />Overall, buy it.  This is probably one of thebest punk records of all time and unlike some bands that have political statements in their music (NOFX) Green Day sculpts a genius story and makes a good well thought out political statement instead of useless Bush Bashing with no ideas towards how to resolve the problem.  Buy this album now if you love rock music at all.  That's my two cents.  Peace. <br />

B000003S0P|5.0|Not an album of light entertainment and not one to listen to if you're contemplating life after death or depressed.  Reduced to a three piece of Fripp, John Wetton and Bill Bruford with special guests including David Cross (who was just booted from the band prior to this recording), Mark Charig on oboe, and original sax players Mel Collins and Ian McDonald this is Crimson at its most concise, guitar driven best.  Every song radiates a dark power unparallelled in progressive rock at the time.  The almost satanic opening instrumental Red states the tone of this album and its a grim, powerful and majestic one.  Lyrically and musically the band touch on the darker emotions, from the murder of a younger brother in Fallen Angel, to nightmarish paranoia in One More Red Nightmare to the anguish of depression in Starless.  I originally thought the other instrumental, the live improvisation entitled Providence was so named for gods' love or lack thereof for humanity due to its dark, atonal and intense nature (think a rock Penderecki)  But the song is named for where it was recorded:  Providence Rhode Island.  I gotta say Crimson were the only band I've ever heard to channel 20th century classical music and metal in their improvisations, its incredibly powerful.  Starless opens with the most beautiful and stately melodies Crim ever wrote and builds in intensity to a huge and I mean huge finale.  Do not go gently into that good night indeed.  One More Red Nightmare is almost jazz/metal due to Bill Brufords swinging drums and Fripps heavyer than thou opening riff.  Red is a wonderful heavy album and a terrific swansong for the first chapter in the bands history.  And unlike most prog or music from the '70s, It still sounds as fresh today as when I first heard it in 1976.

B000003S0I|4.0|This is the album where the 70's era crimson coalesced into a monster progressive rock unit and Fripp finally got a semi-stable band with which to play:  John Wetton on bass, vocals, Bill Bruford on drums, Jamie Muir on percussion and allsorts and the underated David Cross on violin and keyboards.  Gone were the symphonic and jazz pretentions (if not the tonality and time signatures) of the previous incarnations.  Gone were the romantic and sometimes embarrasingly overwrought lyrics of Pete Sinfield (he almost single handedly ruined their previous album Islands).  With LTIA the Crims decided to become an avant-rock rather than a symphonic-rock band that could play intense and complex instumental workouts, a la Larks' Tongue in Aspic parts 1 and 2 and beautiful ballads such as Book of Saturday with equal facility.  They truly redefined themselves and drastically changed their sound.  The music of LTIA is much more personal, muscular and dark than that of the vast majority of their contemporaries and Crimsons' own previous work.  For the first time since the original line-up Crimson sound like a band rather than the Robert Fripp project.<br /><br />So why is this a flawed masterpiece?  The studio versions of these excellent songs, while very good, are too polite, too measured, too thin sounding to rate a five star rating.  Except for the drummers, the band sounds as if its holding something back.  Fripps' guitar and Wettons' vocals sound somewhat subdued.  If you listen to the Great Deciever live box set of this band (minus percussionist Jaimie Muir) or the Nightwatch you'll hear what I'm getting at.  Live the band is one of the most amazing and powerful units of the progressive rock era, able to destoy listeners eardrums while massaging their craniums.  On LTIA however, well they just don't go as far as they should in terms of passion.  For example on LTIA Fripp is a very good guitarist with a unique style, live he's one of the best rock guitarists in the world.  Likewise the entire band.  Their ability to perform group improvisations is uncanny, but not heard on LTIA.  Perhaps Crimsons' live prowess was the reason why two thirds of Crimsons' next album Starless and Bible Black was recorded at the Amsterdam Concertgebou and Glasgow with the audience edited out (The original Concertgebou concert can be heard on the Nightwatch CD).  That LTIA is a milestone for the band is true, its just that it could have been otherworldly rather than merely excellent.he entire band.

B0001AP12G|5.0|Kanye West is recently an emerging rapper from Chicago, IL.  I would self-assuredly label him as a lyricist because he has a message to send out to the world other than bragging about his bling.  His songs are about politics, religion, racism, and the struggles of life in it self.  He doesn't do this to have anyone feel bad for him; he does it to give inspiration to anyone.  However you fit his lyrics relevant to your life is where you will find your inspiration; there is no doubt in my mind. <br /> West blew up with this album, but he's been using his talent for other artists for years.  He's produced and created beats for famous artist such as Alicia Keys, Jay-z, and Talib Kweli.  These songs such as \\"You don't know my name\\" and \\"Get by\\" are what ultimately got him noticed to be put on the Rocafella Records label.  Finally an album of his own, comprised of 21 tracks full of concept, wit, and a connection to his listeners.  I'm so happy that I can listen to any song, depending on my mood.  Rap was starting to get a degrading name until this record was put on the map with an actual message. <br /> College Dropout brings back a little bit of old school and personality.  The concept for the album is a little unusual.  Kanye feels that it just isn't for some people.  He has made more of a difference to society with his words than any job out of college.  For Kanye West, it means shedding the expectations of everyone else and living his own life, striving to re-define himself.  He is furthermore showing that the \\"College Dropout\\" still has knowledge.  He uses this to create tracks with a little sense of humor for the mainstream media.  I would say that the CD is about half mainstream, half diverse and political.  His mainstream songs are a little more fun and care-free.  The others would categorize under philosophy, relating to all different types of people.  His different style makes each song fun to listen for me. <br /> There are many songs on this album that I wouldrate very highly.  Two of the most insightful tracks are \\"Jesus Walks\\" and \\"Family Business.\\"  They both have a completely different sound than what has been recently played on the radio.  \\"Family Business\\" brings a smile to your face, leaving you reminiscing about great times growing up.  When was the last time you were able to do that from rap lyrics?  I think it's odd in itself that a rap artist even writes a song involving family, and he has much more of message to this song than just that.   The lyrics I always catch myself singing is, \\"I woke up early this morning with a new state of mind, a creative way to rhyme without using knives and guns.  Keep your nose out the sky, keep your heart to God, and keep your face to the rising sun.\\"  You can't listen to that without giving it serious thought every time. <br /> \\"Jesus Walks\\" turned the world over with its lyrics.  It even put him up there for gospel music awards.  \\"They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus.  That means guns, sex, lies, video tapes.  But if I talk about God my record won't get played?\\"  What a powerful statement.  Morals are almost extinct in media now.  He brings much more to music than what's pounded in our heads from day to day.  He realizes that music is something that everyone connects to, and if he can give something for people to think about, music is the way to do it. <br /> Through this album, West has shown the people that he is not a rapper with a conscience; he is a regular person with a conscience.  He avoids the clichs of rap music by not wearing sports gear nor rapping about guns.  This CD shows that he is an outcast to society and the rap game itself, but with more than 3,000,000 copies purchased since February worldwide, Kanye West has the last laugh.   I would recommend this album to anyone and everyone. <br />
B0002VKZL6|4.0|Reviews for this latest effort are sure to be mixed. It's tough to please the dIE hARD Straits fans. But this collection of songs should be judged on their own merit. For those who love Mark's guitar work, there is alot to like here. The playing is quiet and understated, but it still sings. Mark's writing is better than ever. I'm the first one to put on \\"Making Movies\\" and \\"Love over Gold\\" when I need a Knopfler fix, but this mature piece of work along with Mark's other solo work continues to impress. The band is great and the production is as crisp as ever. It's nice to have Mark back (I was worried after the accident).  <br />
B00003CXWV|4.0|For the movie Blow, the old saying holds true:  The higher you go, the further you can fall. George Jung was the typical American, wanting nothing more but to get rich quick.  The dramatic sequence of events summarized the history of cocaine in America and the biography of George Jung (Johnny Depp), largest American drug lord in the late 70's and early 80's.   The drama just sucks you in filled with disappointment, lies, betrayal, deceit, money and drugs, the essentials that made Blow so well directed. <br /> The main thing that makes this movie so interesting is the reality of it all.  A lot of it is twisted a bit by Hollywood, but you can't help but watch in awe that this happened.  This man was responsible for the drug of choice by the rich and famous three decades ago.  If you bought cocaine in the late 70's, early 80's, chances are you got it from him.  Jung trafficked more than  of all cocaine that circulated America.  This documentary leaves you stunned, keeping you tuned for was happens next. <br /> It started off like most that spend their life, striving for prosperity. That's about the only connection I can make to my real life.    His father didn't provide enough money for the family though he worked hard at it.  Then you had the dissatisfied mother.   George never wanted to be like that, so he took the fastest way to wealth.  He started small time with marijuana on the California coast.  Through that he found people to help with his smuggling operations.  The story bases on his many mistakes that imprisoned him from time to time.  That only gave him an outlet to bigger and better crimes. <br /> Throughout the movie you're not sure whether you feel bad for the man, or whether he was simply not careful enough.  For example, the one scene where his wife, Mirtha, purposely gets him arrested ironically gives you remorse.  The director did a great job with the importance of money.  Money is such a big theme all the way through.  Millions of dollars are presented in your face to make a huge impact of what George has gained, yet what he could lose.  It's basically how the small town kid made 100 million dollars and lost it all. <br /> As far as acting goes, again Johnny Depp stars in another great movie.  Penelope Cruz co-stars as his flamboyant, deceitful wife, Mirtha.  The characters they act are artificial to each other, bringing the main point across.  Realistically, the tie between them was only of money.  When the money was gone instantly, so were they, showing how unhealthy their lifestyles were based on. <br />Like they say, more money, more problems.  Blow focuses on the dramatic aspects more than anything.  There's a little comedy and a little action with gunplay but that's it.  They don't take much distraction from the drama.  It makes the movie seem about an hour longer than it really is because of all the problems.  Jung lost his money, his family, his business, he lost it all.  The film puts out a heavy message about what you can lose.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to step out of reality for a few hours. <br />  <br />
B00005JK8K|1.0|I rented this video recently, being a big fan of the WW II genre, from the classics (The Longest Day, Patton, The Young Lions) to the more recent greats (Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers, Enemy at the Gates, Das Boot). I was pretty sure I would end up buying it eventually on dvd, but couldn't wait to see it.<br /><br />  Boy, was I ever disappointed. This has to be one of the most wooden, trite, and cliche'd action blockbusters I have ever seen! Every overused action-film sequence is used one more time in this enormously over-long film. * (The \\"Baywatch\\" shot of Cage running on the beach to forget his troubles made me laugh out loud!)<br /><br />  Poor Christian Slater has little to do in this film but make his trademark \\"Young Jack Nicholson\\" facial expressions and spit out extremely cardboard dialogue.<br /><br />  Not only is this probably the worst war film I have ever seen, but an enormous disappointment considering the level of talent involved. Don't waste your time, rent Sands of Iwo Jima instead!
0316168815|1.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from this book and unfortunately, I found the storylines scattered, the characters underdeveloped and the plot jerky and awkward.  <br /> <br />It started out well but slowly unraveled and spun off into too many directions to keep up with.  <br /> <br />I'm left wondering, what was the point?  <br /> <br />Disappointing, I'm glad I borrowed this one from the library instead of shelling out the money to own it.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|Yes,we're heard it all before.How Eddie was the only guy since Hendrix to revolutionize guitar rock.How Dave and Eddie never got along after the 3rd album.And how the 1985 split pissed off alot of people.Well as much drama and stories that come along with this band,there is no denying the grandeur and monumental acheivement of the infamous 1978 debut.With the original group,these guys were the greatest rock and roll band to come out of the US since Aerosmith.Their debut skyrocketed them from bars,to playing some of the biggest gigs and stadiums in the US alongside the most legendary names in rock:ACDC,Aerosmith,Black Sabbath,Ted Nugent,The Rolling Stones.They saved rock and roll at a time when disco,new wave,and punk became the american mainstream.Van Halen became america's rock and roll band,taking the torch from Aerosmith(who had probably smoked it by then.) <br /> <br />This album was made as if it was going to be Van Halen's first and last album.Track after track of non-stop ear-shattering tunes that will leave you in awe.There are the tracks we're all heard before.\\"Runnin' With The Devil\\",\\"Eruption,\\"You Really Got Me\\",\\"Ain't Talkin' Bout Love\\", and \\"Jamie's Cryin'\\" are all classic tunes the band is known for on classic rock radio and they only make up the first half!The other half is just as good.\\"Feel Your Love Tonight\\" just makes you want to sing along.The back-up vocals shine on this track.\\"Little Dreamer\\" is not your typical VH headbanger,but slows the tempo and just shows that these guys don't need to wrote a bunch of fast party songs to rock.\\"On Fire\\" is a neck thrashing rocker with hilarious yet raunchy vocals by Diamond Dave.\\"Ice Cream Man\\" is a nice blues tune with some nice acoustic work by diamond dave.just a good fun bluesy tune with a face melting solo by eddie.\\"I'm The One\\" is a rocker with a neat accapella like breakdown in the middle.Some pretty fast fret-work here by eddie and once again,you got the trademark back-up stylings of eddie amd mike.this is the only band that could combine heavy,fast riffs with pop-like sing along back-up vocals. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />one of the greatest bands of all time along with aerosmith,acdc,zeppelin,the stones,gnr,and the black crowes.
B00005JMJG|5.0|This movie reminds everyone that all memories, good AND yes, BAD, are what makes us who we are. A doctor has invented a method to erase our bad memories so that we may never have to relive or think about them ever again. Jim Carrey's character, after a breakup with his girlfriend, decides he wants to go on with the procedure, but during the procedure, he learns that he is making a terrible mistake.    I love this movie. It's my favorite movie of 2004 and so far, the only DVD I've bought the first day it came out. \\"Eternal Sunshine\\" is a clever, creative and innovative romantic film with bits of comedy. I loved the plot, the shots, the soundtrack, the ending, and the way everything was uniquely put together! I like watching it over and over, to catch things I didn't notice in the first viewing. I'm not a big Jim Carrey fan, so it was a nice change to see him play a role that didn't require him to overact (yet he pulled it off very well). A great movie for those with great imagination!
B0002S943O|4.0|i really expected more than just the concert. Well, it has extras but :<br /><br />The anton monologue give us not too much info. The lights reflects on the tour books when he shows them to the camera.<br /><br />The tour books has no zoom option (a dvd, with all the technology that sorrounds could have).<br /><br />There is no animation nor sound in the menues. Just the devotional-type font with the menu options. Have you seen movies-dvd? Have you see the menues?. That's what I mean. It looks like the simplest interface a programmer can do.<br /><br />The film is grainy. The sound is great. But the center-channel is not dedicated uniquely to the voice as it does in the A night in Paris dvd.<br /><br />Why separate Policy of Truth and Halo in other option????? They should be in their original order. There is no time-limit as with the Laser Disc edition.<br /><br />I am a devotee fan of DM, but I really expected more. At least some animation in the dvd menues.<br /><br />Ah! one more: the projection for Never Let me Dowm Again. Was it intended to be ajoke what appears at the first 4 minutes of the projection???? about the mummy and what it says!!!<br /><br />sorry the grammar errors, I'm peruvian.
B00005YU1O|5.0|Waking life was an all encompassing theatrical release of the lost art of philosophy.  When I watched this film, I was blown away by the merging of dripping salvador dali like imagery with very modern philosophic ideas.  In particular I could relate to the professor who discussed the evolution of mankind as becoming, in modern times, accelerated... to the point where we can actually witness it in a span of a lifetime and that it has become instead of a physiological evolution, one of morality... where we begin to select one another based on criteria such as compassion and intelligence.  In other words we are developing into a race of beings which is evolving through the developement of the mind.  This is just one of the aspects of the film that I loved.<br />Another is the enigmatic study of language and  other ideas discussed in the film.  How do we interpret words like \\"love\\"?  How did we develop our language and why?  What purpose do our dreams serve?<br />One would benefit from their own studies of their dreams and an attempt to have lucid dreams through lucid dream learning techniques described in Stephen Laberge's \\"Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming\\".<br />There are so many engaging ideas brought to life by this film that all I can say is that Linklater is a revolutionary in the art of capturing ideas in a cinematic format.  \\"Dazed and Confused\\" was entertaining and a slice in the life of a teenager, but it was a commercial venture for him.  \\"Waking Life\\" is food for thought for the free thinker and the open minded.  Highly recomended for all who have independent thoughts about evolution, the develpoment of liguistics and the broad study of dream imagery.
1591840562|1.0|Although Guy likes everyone to think him a founder of Apple Computers, he's not. He's a guy who joined the company much later when it was well established. However, he has built a career on his status as an ex-Apple employee.  <br /> <br />This career has consisted of publishing a long list of truly dreadful business books. A few years ago a friend gave me three of Guy's books for free. Despite being a voracious reader of business books, I could not finish any of them. They were nothing but collections of worthless banalities. I ended up reluctantly throwing them out. I say \\"reluctantly\\" because throwing books into the garbage is normally taboo for me. <br /> <br />This book is just more worthless nonsense. The author is a master at self-promotion. If you want to learn about self-promotion study his technique rather than reading his books. <br /> <br />I'll probably be the lone voice of dissent amongst reviewers here. Guy has certainly succeeded in marshalling his friends to flood the page with gushing 5 star reviews. <br /> <br />If you want a good startup book there are plenty of much better ones out there written by real entrepreneurs. <br />
B0000C9V3T|5.0|The films of Quentin Tarantino have always had strong soundtracks to back-up the witty, quirky, violent material and \\"Kill Bill Vol. 1\\" is no different. Some might even argue that this soundtrack surpasses the previous Tarantino classic, \\"Pulp Fiction.\\" \\"Kill Bill\\" works in both aspects of a great soundtrack: You can't help but picture the images from the film while listening to the music but you can also appreciate the material as just pure songs. The album mixes instrumentals with classic performances and you even get some dialogue from the movie (and a few sound effects as a bonus). The set opens with Nancy Sinatra's mournful, stylish \\"Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)\\" which displays her timeless voice stripped of strings and Lee Hazelwood's creepy voice and left to carry you along with the almost funeral-like electric guitar notes. \\"The Grand Duel\\" by Luis Bacalov has a western edge to it, almost with an Ennio Morricone flavor. Bernard Herrmann's \\"Twisted Nerve\\" is the catchy, famous whistle Darryl Hannah performs walking down a hospital hallway. There is enough diversity in this album to please even fans of oriental pop with \\"The Flower Of Carnage\\" and easy listening types with James Last's immortal \\"The Lonely Sheperd.\\" There are little curiosities here like the 5,6,7,8's who do \\"Woo Hoo\\" with a surfer rocker flare that makes this basically senseless tune fun. Rapper RZA pops in with some techno/score music that takes us back to the Bride looking over the Crazy 88's with her Hatori Hanzo sword. What the soundtrack to \\"Kill Bill\\" proves is that Tarantino is a director of surprisingly impressive tastes when it comes to choosing the music for his films. Watch the movie and listen to the CD, they're both awesome experiences in this age of lame commercial filmmaking.
B000059TFO|5.0|This true story took place in Mississippi.  Three civil rights leaders were found to be missing, and shortly thereafter the feds are sent in to solve the crime.  In this movie three 'men died 'neath the Mississippi moon' (\\"Oxford Town\\" by Bob Dylan), and I have to add, from my own personal experience, my aunt died violently too in Mississippi.  I saw this movie when it came out at a movie theatre in my hometown of Memphis, TN.  In the row or so behind me and the friend I went with, several african-american girls sang softly the few hymns that were sung in this movie.  Wow, was that moving; it made me realize that the story was all too real, and it happened in my own backyard so to speak.  But funny things happen in the South as this movie reveals.
B0002VKZL6|3.0|Perhaps all dIRE sTRAITS fans have matured together with MK' music style and we all know that Mr. Knopfler will not go backwards and record an album like dIRE's debut album or like Love Over Gold, but I honestly expected more of this album. I am a huge fan of his solo work, but I think there is a lack of superlative compositions like his guitar work on Darling Pretty, for instance. From that album, Golden Heart, his solo carreer debut, you can also identify superb guitar solos on Imelda, Rudiger and on the wonderful Are We In Trouble Now. After that album came Sailing to Philadelphia and the guitar work was again fabulous, but slightly less impressive than that one found in Golden Heart. And so kept happening with The Ragpicker's Dream and now with this one. Why MK did not include Pyroman (performed live, only) on his album? I liked very much indeed Boom Like That and 5:15 AM, but are only two songs of an album that deserved better examples of the geniality of the \\"Quiet Guy from Rock and Roll\\".
B00005JKZ3|1.0|One wonders why execs bother with such perfunctory sequels when they're not even particularly well made. MIB-II offers exactly two chuckles, plus a few pleasantries here and there. Not sure why Tommy Jones was roped in again, he looks about as emotive as his suit. The handful of memorable lines that we do get treated to come from Smith, he singlehandedly carries this 80 minutes ordeal. Which is about 75 minutes too many.
0440237688|4.0|The Giver is an excellent book and one I would highly recommend. There is much deeper philosophy than meets the eye within this small novel. I was intrigued by the society found within it; The Giver is a book enjoyable as a simple read on one level, and an excellent treatise on the human state on the other. As you read it, make parallels between the book and our current society. The book itself is a metaphor hearkening to modern society, and defiantly deserved the 4 stars I am giving it. A 5th star was not achieved for a couple reasons; one, the book is perhaps a bit on the short side. Finally, the ending of the book was, for me, a bit of a drop. We will see how you like it!
B000000WJK|5.0|I am writing this ten years too late but for all those getting into this music now there is something lost on some of you (especially the disappointed 'music fan' person).     I bought this album in 1994 and listened to a friends copy (as I lost mine) just last week the first time in two maybe three years - it's lost no magic. What the 'music fan' is not getting is the fact that at the time this experimental 'Astral Rock' (as we called it) was a progression from the punk/brit/indie scene with a cool 'shot' of digression! A storm's whole sound had  moved sideways if you like, an off-shoot where everything was slowed down but stayed loud!  I get it cos i was there (in body anyway), Mr Oborny gets it because he knows his music (although we as a group of 8 or 9 guys listened to this in the early hours 'winding down' from the night out my friend - it can be enjoyed in groups!) , and the other forty odd reviewers get it- they have vision!     The 'music fan' rates 'urban hymns'- which says it all really. I don't empathise I sympathise! Lets face it 'A Storm' and 'A Northern Soul' are shedloads better - and I still love Urban Hymns!    As bands go they are superb well worth buying - Richard Ashcroft is class, I saw them at Irvine Beach in 1995 (Scotland) supporting Oasis and before the performance began Ashcroft took his shoes off and stood on a big furry sheep skin rug bare footed the whole show - thats rock and roll!    Others to look out for right now, get in early 'music fan', Kasabian, Zutons, Killers, The Rakes, Razorlight and of course Scotlands own Franz Ferdinand!
B00005JNEI|5.0|Dear people of America,  <br /> <br />First off I am a republican. I began to see this movie thinking that it was all propaganda, but it's not. It's not at all. Whatever the reason is that you have against Moore. You can't deny to see this movie. Most of the people that hate this movie, haven't even see it. This movie has a powerful message about our adminstration and their connections. A lot of facts in the movie are in the 9/11 commission. Saudi Arabia is been considered a big funding for the al-quada under US department investigation. And in this movie you'll see the connections the Bush family has with the saudi's. I saw \\"crap c's\\" review about how Moore hates America. I would think that is true, but if it was wouldn't he leave this country like Johnny Depp. If anything, I think he likes this country and just questions about what needs to change, and I'll tell you what needs to be change our president. I'm voting for John Kerry. And I hope you'll at least look at this film and think on your own, realizing we'll need a change in America.
B00003CXCT|1.0|Lucas should be ashamed. He himself has said it was wrong for a studio to compromise a director's vision and now he goes and does just that. Lucasfilm may own The Empire Strikes Back, but George Lucas did not direct it. He didn't write it. He didn't produce it. He managed to show up on the set once for a photo op in his vague role as Executive Producer. He should keep his hands off of it now. As a film fan I am offended. I'm getting a new VCR and watching my VHS tapes until they wear out. Greedy Lucas will probably be ready to make more money by putting out the theatrical versions by then.
B0002OERI0|5.0|okay, so as some ppl have said, the song American Idiot is Anti-American. but u always must think of free speech. but thats besides the point. this is just the greatest album ive heard in a long time. ive been listening to sugarcult and have been LOVIN it, but this album blows them away. you can relate to some of these songs, and some are just plain fun like \\"She's a Rebel\\" and \\"St. Jimmy\\". this is the album to buy if u want the ultimate Punk Rock album.

B0002HDT9A|2.0|Timeline is a novel based upon the workings of Michael Crichton (Congo, Jurassic Park, Eaters Of The Dead) and the outcome is a total waste, why because I read the book. Paul Walker's (The Fast and The Furious1-2) father, Billy Connelly (Mrs. Brown), is put back into the 13th century by a time traveling machine and he geos to get him back with the help of a groupe of his archeologist friends, Gerard Butler (Reign Of Fire) and Frances O'Connor (A.I.Artifical Intelligence) Trouble happens when one of them comes back but blows up the machine with a grenade. So Walker and friends are trapped in time with little to spare and the scientists back at home, Ethan Embry (Tv's Freakylinks), David Thewlis (Harry Potter and The Prisoner Of Azkaban) and Matt Craven (Masterminds), are trying to bring them back. Meanwhile, theres a war going on with the French and the British. Walker and friends are caught in the crossfire, with time barreling down its a race to get back home. The script along with the bland acting badly crushes it but the action set pieces are what keeps it going. Too bad, this one had some potential and couldve been directed by someone else other then Richard Donner (Lethal Weapon1-4). Also starring Neal McDonough (Walking Tall '04), Marton Csktos (Triple X), Michael Sheen (Underworld '03) and Lambert Wilson (The Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions).
B00003CXCT|1.0|Everybody, listen to this set in 5.1 surround.  You will find not only the music errors in the rear channel (left & right swapped) and the loss of background music and explosions, but also the dialog is messed up.  Episode Four has places where the dialog keeps switching from clear to not-so-clear like a high frquency filter is being switched in and out.  Mr \\"THX\\" really should not only be ashamed, but immediately pull all the copies from retail shelves and refund anyone with a receipt full price until discs can be released that are not screwed up.  DON'T BUY IT!!!
B00005JLEX|5.0|So, \\"Seinfeld\\" is finally on DVD.  You gotta wonder what took so long.  In the early episodes of \\"Seinfeld\\", the show would start out with Jerry doing his stand up act, but until the 8th or 9th season, none of the episodes did. <br /> <br />This show is about absolutely nothing.  My brother would ask me how do I get \\"Seinfeld\\".  I told him you don't have to get it, you just have to watch it.  Clearly, he's not into \\"Seinfeld\\".  Neither is my dad.  He doesn't really care for Jerry and George, because when they shout their voices get all high and whiny.  He hates that.  It doesn't really bother me that much. <br /> <br />What \\"Cheers\\", \\"Family Ties\\", \\"The Cosby Show\\" and \\"Night Court\\" did in the 80's, \\"Seinfeld\\" did in the 90's.

B00005JMJG|4.0|Perhaps Charlie Kaufman's best script to date, this is probably my favorite film about the joys and pitfalls of relationships since Woody Allen's \\"Annie Hall\\". Annoying performances by Elijah Wood and Kirsten Dunst (is there a worse young actress?)are easily forgiven after a tremendous emotional payoff. <br />This material would easily make a truly great 5 star film in the hands of a director more adroit with Kaufman's vision (Spike Jonze!). Gondry does a very good job here, but lacks the off-beat visual gifts really necessary to elevate this script to it's full potential. Nonetheless, a very good film.
B00005JMJG|5.0|This is a very moving and emotional movie. Some of the scenes are so closely linked to what real dreams, thoughts, and highly emotional situations actually feel like that it really pulls on your heart. It makes you think about your past and existing relationships on an even deeper level, if thats possible (some of us think too deeply as it is). The effects that Michel Gondry brings to this movie are very well done. Its also relatively unpredictable, which is refreshing.
B0000AYJXR|4.0|Space Jam is a great movie for Looney Tunes animation but the acting was terrible therefore making any and all live action sequences bad by default.  I'm a big fan of Looney Tunes however so the actual animation portions of the film redeem the time spent watching it.    This review is for everyone who is a fan of the extra cartoon shorts on this dvd realease.  When I saw that \\"Invasion of the Bunny Snatchers\\" was added as a bonus feature I was pumped.  I bought the dvd immediately and was greatly dissapointed by the fact that it is the censored and cut version!  HOLY COW!  Warner Bros!  How could you do this?!  \\"Invasion of the Bunny Snatchers\\" is amazing and you happened to transfer the version in which Yosemite Sam is completely cut out from the cartoon?  The only reason this version exists is because it needed to be cut for time on television at some point.    Warner Bros, please release the uncut version of \\"Invasion of the Bunny Snatchers\\".  Possibly as an extra on Looney Tunes Golden Collection Vol. III.      Props for releasing \\"The Duxorcist\\" and \\"Night of the Living Duck\\" which alone make this Space Jam dvd worthy of purchase.  Please consider also releasing other newer shorts like \\"Box Office Bunny\\", \\"Carrotblanca\\", \\"Chariots of Fur\\" and the half dozen Chuck Jones shorts made in the 90s before he passed away.

B00005JMEW|4.0|Im a big fan of Tarantino movies,  and although this one isnt one of my favorites its still really good.  The movie got a lot of press because there were literally hundreds of killings,  really gory stuff.  Tarantino at least had the sense to do the really gory scenes in black and white which did lessen the nastiness of it all but was still nasty!!  hehe <br /> <br /> <br />     So if youre a fan of Tarantino movies go get it.....but be warned....its real gory!!!
0375805613|5.0|This book is of course a classic.  I was excited to buy it to read to my 2 year old.  He loves it to.  A must have!
0385504209|4.0|I had avoided this book for the longest time because frankly the idea of a convoluted thriller around the Holy Grail did not appeal to me. To my chagrin, I find this novel to be consistently entertaining in spite of the rather intimidating topics it covers - the Catholic Church, pagan religions, and religious mysteries. True, there are some lengthy historical passages that weigh down the book unnecessarily. At the same time, it does not require a catechism to get through the dense plot. In fact, author Dan Brown appears to thrive on the reader's initial ignorance and produces a comprehensive education around the story of the Holy Grail, as well as the symbols and histories which are intrinsically connected to it. But Brown is able to balance the extremely onerous subject, as well as the reader's preconceived notions about it, with an endlessly fascinating mystery that leads to one surprising revelation after another.<br /><br />Without giving the story away, suffice it to say that everyone in this book is in the hunt for the secrets hidden by the Priory of Sion including the Grail. Some want to protect it, some want to expose it, and some want to destroy it. Harvard professor Robert Langdon and Paris police cryptologist Sophie Neveu, equipped with secrets shared by the murdered curator of the Louvre, Jacques Sauni&egrave;re, are ahead of everyone else, but police, assassins, and churchmen aren't far behind. The race is on, and the puzzles to be solved seem incomprehensible. This is where Brown excels as he keeps reader interest high in spite of the convolutions. In particular, Langdon's explanations for clues and tricks hidden within Da Vinci's paintings make you want to go look at them all and see if it's true. His comments about the early church, the origins of the gospels, and the assimilation of pagan rituals and symbols into the church's practices and holy days make sense when he tells them, and they come across as easily understood historical facts, whether true or not. Since I am not well versed on the teachings around the Catholic Church, the veracity of the book was a moot point to me. The pages turn quickly as the information is presented, the latest puzzle is solved, and the next escape is done by the skin of their teeth. Despite Langdon's bottomless knowledge, the moral center of the story is really Sophie, especially as she recognizes her past has shaped her to be the possessor of information that could change history and religion. Brown's decision to focus on Sophie's evolution makes the book resonate all the more since we can more readily relate to her plight. This is one breathless thriller albeit a rather pedantic one at times due to the subject matter. Not quite a masterpiece of fiction but an educational and fun read.not.

B00005JNEI|5.0|Hey Ray!  Why don't you join the rest of the right-wing sheep out there and rejoice that the lies and attacks that your party and your president are heaping on a genuine war hero are working.  This movie has facts and actual events that have been researched and proven to be true.  It sure must sting to hear the facts, but the truth hurts.  People who buy this aren't idiots, you self-righteous jerk.  They are people who want their country back from the neo-cons and the PNAC types who want to cram Christianity down the throats of the rest of the world.  Buy this film if you want to know the truth and become educated.  Save this country and vote Kerry on Nov. 2.
B000002UAR|5.0|That's a good question.The Beatles made what were without a <br />doubt the best albums during the 1960's and 'Revolver' might well <br />be the best of them.Why?Because wheras 'Sgt.Pepper' is very <br />self-consiously artistic 'Revolver' focuses on basic melodies and <br />hooks,even if all 14 songs are mini-innovations.The backwards <br />tape loops alone on Lennon's  highly hummable \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" <br />and his exotically familier psychedelia of \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" <br />are two of the albums big highlights!McCartney also makes the <br />most of this album with his two greatest ballads in \\"Here,There <br />And Everywhere\\" and the brillant \\"For No One\\" while also entertaining us with the soul-oriented \\"Got To Get You Into My <br />Life\\",\\"Good Day Sunshine\\" and the classicly inclined \\"Elenor <br />Rigby\\".Oh and George shines very brightly on the hard rocking <br />\\"Taxman\\" and the bouncy \\"I Want To Tell You\\".Even Ringo's <br />childrens song \\"Yellow Submarine\\" sound transcendant!So while <br />almost every single tune on this album stands alone as an instant <br />classic (especially the ones just mentioned) but taken together <br />in this album they open up even further the possibility of what <br />the long playing 33 1/3 LP record could do and none of that magic <br />is lost on this CD version!A definate Beatles essencial!
B000060MWU|4.0|Lost Highway could be 'Ultimate Lynch'.<br /><br />The film is more a dream than a coherent story or meditation on anything.  It doesn't make much 'sense', but I don't think the point is to make any sense.<br /><br />The film plays with the ideas of time, and of being in two places at once. In the beginning, Bill Pullman is Fred, a sax player in LA married to Renee (Patricia Arquette). Their marriage is...icy at best. One day they begin getting strange videos in the mail that suggest someone is getting into their house at night and taping them and their surroundings. Eventually, they get a tape of Renee's slaughtered corpse, and soon Fred gets thrown in jail.<br /><br />One day, the guards walk by and notice someone else is in Fred's cell.  It's young Pete, a mechanic.  Since they can't hold him, he gets released and is soon back living with his parents (including Gary Busey) and working at an auto garage.  He meets up with a good customer, wiseguy Mr. Eddie, who also makes porn and has a hot number with him: Alice, also played by Patricia Arquette. And along the way, there's a bizarre little 'Mystery Man', played by none other than Robert Blake.<br /><br />Yeah. Anyway, the film is heavy on style and atmosphere, the colors, the photography, the music (Angelo Badalamenti's score is complimented by NIN, Marilyn Manson, David Bowie, and Rammstein tracks) are fantastic, lending the film a deep, cold feel to the bizarre events.<br /><br />I'm convinced that to overly scrutinize the plot is to miss the point. I'm not sure there is a point. This is some other world, where 'our' rules do not apply, and we can only be left to ponder the surface questions. Are Fred and Pete the same person? Does everyone have two different parts to them? What happens when they are separated, and how to do they communicate with each other?  It's doubtful you'll seek this film out by accident. If you like Lynch even a bit, it's his must-see film next to Blue Velvet. It's flat out bizarre. I still like it, though can't cite specifics.<br /><br />For some reason, it's only available on Region 2 DVD. Why? This is begging for a good package, at least some good extras. If you have the right player, the disc is good.  Recommended also for fans of the bizarre...zarre.

B00003CXCT|1.0|Don't get me wrong, it's still a good movie.  However, changing scenes, adding in another actors image over another, and changing the music is just wrong.  It would be nice if I could trade in this set for the Star Wars: The Classic Edition.
0783240287|5.0|I was lucky enough to see JOSEPH in Toronto with Donny Osmond in '93, and thought it was great. Then I got the VHS edition, and tought it was great, again. Especially when you consider that this started out as a 20 minute conerto, and ALW kept adding to it. As far as the costumes, consider the the times and the circumstances. As far as the reviewer who said this was a Christian story. Re-read your bible, since this story is over 400 years BEFORE THE EXODUS of the HEBREWS from Egypt, and is a JEWISH story, as related in the book of Genesis, the 1st book of the TORAH!(This review refers to the Stage Production in Toronto and the VHS edition)
068484267X|5.0|The book Angela's Ashes was a self account written by Frank McCourt.  The book goes back in time and through Frank's childhood and talks about all the troubles he had to experience while growing up in a poor catholic Irish family.  The book starts out by Frank remembering as much as he could from his childhood as young as he could remember it (although he does include how his parents met, I'm sure this is from what stories he has been told by relatives).  He goes onto tell about the hardships his family went through and how hard they had to work to overcome these obstacles.  Frankie grew up changing housing quite often because his father couldn't hold a steady job and back in poor Ireland, landlords wanted their money just like everyone else.  The hardest part about Frank's family trying to keep a home was that any money his father would earn he would go and spend at the pub and then he would show up to the job drunk and therefore get fired instantly for being late or drunk to work.  Frankie's mother had to stay at home and raise their rapidly growing and rapidly diminishing family.  He accounts to the several deaths of people quite close to him that he witnessed at a young age and the hard times he himself had to endure as he was sent to work to help support his family and himself at a young age.  There are many things Frankie himself had to do which caused him to mature and become the status of an adult long before his time.  While other boys and girls were out playing in the streets kicking rocks to pass the free time, Frankie and his brothers were walking around by the coal docks picking up the coal chunks that were left on the streets.  From steeling food to try to keep his family living to going and living with relatives to get a higher and better job, Frankie didn't have much time for himself to grow and realize who he really was.  This book was touching to the spirit and adjusting to the eyes.   <br />      As a young middle classed person, it showed me how it really was to live in times such as these for a poor family trying to make things work.  It shows the relationship between mother and father and children and how they wanted the best for their kids.  I couldn't put this book down and many nights sat with a box of Kleenex next to the bed as I sat and read.  I would recommend this book to anyone who I thought would take it for what it's worth and understand just exactly what Frankie and his family had to go through to get to where he was in his life at the stories end.  <br />      While I was reading this book, I thought a lot about my friends and family.  Living in a totally different time period made a difference but there where things that could apply to times of today.  I would often read something that Frankie had to go through such as a death of someone, and I would think how would I be able to handle that at his age?  Or the fact that Frankie started working when he was a young boy, I don't know how I would have been able to give up my childhood as easily as he did.  Reading this book really made me think about how far would I really go to help my family survive.  Frankie put not only himself on the line but all of his family members and even through the hardships loved them all unconditionally.     <br />
B00005NC66|5.0|Breathless, as a movie, is a delight. And David Sterritt's commentary on this DVD is the perfect accompaniment. He obviously loves this film, loves its characters, its actors, its quirky little devices, its big philosophical themes. He delights in everything about it, and I can't imagine anyone failing to be swept along with his enthusiasm.<br /><br />Furthermore, the visual quality of this disk is excellent. Breathless was originally shot on 16mm film, but many of the scenes on this restored recording look as sharp, clear, and beautifully lit as B&W still photographs by Edward Weston.
0064400557|5.0|Summary:  Wilber, the runt of the pig liter, is saved from death by a little girl named Fern. Fern convinces her father to let her raise the pig herself with a bottle. She feels that even though he is a runt, he still deserves a chance to live like everyone else.  Fern is successful in her attempts, and when Wilber is big and strong enough, she sells him to her Uncle.  On her Uncle's farm, Wilbur will be properly fed and Fern will also have the opportunity to visit regularly. After Wilber is sent to his new home, he misses Fern and is lonely. This is when Wilber befriends Charlotte, a large grey spider who lives in the rafters of Wilber's barn.  Throughout the story, Charlotte and Wilber build a strong friendship together.  Wilber becomes devastated and frightened when he finds out his ultimate fate as a pig on a farm; to be killed and eaten in the fall.  He turns to Charlotte for help, who promises to save him from being killed.  Charlotte decides in order to save Wilbur, she will spin a web that reads \\"Some Pig\\".  Charlotte's plan works, her web is seen as a miracle and everyone believes that Wilber is no ordinary pig.  People travel from all over to see Wilber.  With help from Templeton, a rat who also lives in the barn, Charlotte is able to think of more words to spin into her web to convince everyone of Wilber's greatness so that he will not be killed. She spins the word \\"Terrific\\", \\"Radiant\\", and finally the word \\"Humble\\".  Wilber ends up winning a prize at the fair because everyone has been convinced that Wilber is an extraordinary pig.  Charlotte was successful in saving Wilber's life. At the end Charlotte passes away from old age.  Wilber is able to take her pouch of eggs back to the barn, and carefully watch until all of her babies hatch, continuing on his best friend's legacy.   <br /> <br />Evaluation:  This classic children's novel received a Newberry Honor in 1953. Charlotte's Web teaches children many different important lessons through its ingeniouswell-rounded characters and superbly composed fast-moving plot.  It is amusing, somber, and touching all at the same time.  It is a transitional level book, with shorter chapters, therefore it is appropriate for beginning readers to read on their own.  It is also suitable for a teacher to read aloud to his or her class. <br /> <br />A child is able to take away many lessons from reading Charlotte's Web. The most obvious lesson that children can learn from the book is the importance of friendship. Charlotte teaches Wilbur what it is like to have a friend.  Before Charlotte, Wilbur was lonely and had no one to talk to.  The book also teaches children about loyalty. Charlotte is loyal to Wilbur until the end when she dies.  Even though she knows she must lay her eggs, she still accompanies Wilbur to the fair to support him and give him confidence.  She wants to keep the promise she originally gave to Wilbur; that she would save him from being killed.  Finally, the story contains many examples of farm life, animals, seasons, and growing up.  <br /> <br />There are minimal illustrations within the book. These simple black and white drawings help the reader to create more elaborate images within their own head while they continue to read.  <br /> <br />One of the most interesting aspects of this book is the sophisticated vocabulary used by Charlotte throughout the story. Throughout the book, Charlotte uses complex words that Wilbur does not understand. He then asks her to define the word, which she does, helping him to comprehend the meaning.  This offers children a creative opportunity to learn many new words that they may have never encountered before.
B0002VKZL6|2.0|I really didn't pay much attention to Knopfler between his Dire Straits heyday and the 21st century.  But I bought \\"Ragpicker's Dream\\" on a lark two years ago, and thought it was fabulous.  There were four or five instantly memorable songs that just jumped off the CD.  Sorry I can't say the same for this one.  The pacing is slow, the writing is mediocre, and the guitar work doesn't make you go \\"wow.\\"  Maybe Mark should wait a little longer than two years for the next album.  This one is likely headed for oblivion.
0805017445|4.0|Summary:  On each page of this story, the reader encounters a new animal in a different color who urges you onward to the following page where yet another animal in a different color is found.  This pattern is repeated over and over until the end of the story when the reader has come across all the animals.  The story starts with a brown bear. Next follows a red bird, a yellow duck, a blue horse, a green frog, a purple cat, a white dog, a black sheep, and finally a goldfish.<br /><br />Evaluation:  This is an excellent book to either read aloud or for children to learn to read with.  The rhythmic and repetitive text will act as an aid for children in helping them to memorize and recognize words.  The bright life-like illustrations are also very enjoyable and entertaining.  They are very appropriate for the age level this story is geared towards.  Children will find some of the animals humorous, for example, the purple cat and the blue horse.  Martin does an excellent job intertwining education with entertainment in this story.
B00005JLWN|5.0|I know you may find this hard to believe but I felt this film was better than the Matrix. I could predict eaisly what was about to happen in the Matrix while Equillibrium suprised me over and over. The premise was fantastic and Christian Bale (Preston) did a fantastic job of playing the main character. What shocked me most of all is that I had never heard of this amazing piece of cinema until my brother rented it one night on a whim. It is truly sad that a movie this good does not get better coverage... <br /> <br />...one of the best sci's of all time.
6305949980|5.0|The special edition of \\"Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" (1993) is a terrific buy for the yuletide season. Written and co-produced by Burton, this stop-motion animated film remains ghoulish fun - well-directed by Henry Selick and featuring a memorable Danny Elfman score. The DVD also includes Burton's imaginative work for Disney in the early 1980s: his delightful animated short \\"Vincent\\" (narrated by none other than Vincent Price) and the ingenious, live-action \\"Frankenweenie\\" - an affectionate 30-minute homage to the Boris Karloff-James Whale classic. Throw in the original theatrical trailer, plus some behind-the-screen goodies, and you have a definite keeper.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|cathartic use of emotion.  Thats the tag word most are using for this album.  Its not perfect.  But that is why one should want to listen to it repeatedly.  It takes all the emotions felt over adulthood and channels them into this very focused energy.  The disparate wail in the Neighborhoods (tunnels) to the soft neighborhoods (love) are a complete spectrum.  The main achievement is that the band takes its influences and makes a sound so refreshing it dances in your ears.  Its just so easy to see how much a record label would fight for this band.  after thirty seconds of listening, you should be clicking buy.  If this opinion seems to be written by a scenester then fine.  But a scenester with 700 albums spanning 7 decades wouldnt lie when he said this album is just too original and thoughtprovoking not to be picked up.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Let me start by saying that I DO NOT live in my parents basement. I have never dressed like one of the characters of the Star Wars movies in private or public, and I am grounded in reality, neither I, nor anyone I know can \\"use the Force\\". That being said, I was thrilled when I learned about the Star Wars Trilogy box-set. I picked it up the first day it was available. I knew beforehand that I was buying the 97 re-released films and not the original versions. I didn't care, I was very willing to hand over the $40 for these remastered movies. The DVD's are well worth the money. Sure, there are some changes to the original movies, some addes scenes, some added effects..so what? They don't hamper the story in any way, they add to the visual magic that has always made the Star Wars series so jaw-dropping, and so much fun to watch. I won't bother reviewing the individual movies, because the odds are good anyone reading this has already seen them scores of times. But, I do want to note, that the bonus 4th disk is really great. The \\"Empire of Dreams\\" documentary is informative and fun to watch, and really shows how much hard work Lucas and company put into these films. This disk is a must-view for fans of the films, and will increase your appreciation for all of the movies ten-fold.<br /><br />I wondered if the Star Wars Trilogy would hold up well, I mean I was 8 years old when the first one hit the theaters and was amazed by the movie. I was completely sucked into the story, and became a fan of the series right away. Now I have a six year old son, and I wondered if he would like the films, or if they would seem out-dated and lame compared to what is available to kids today. I popped in \\"A New Hope\\" on Saturday, and was able to enjoy Star Wars in a whole new way, through the eyes of my son. He was soon absorbed in the story, and carried away by the magic only Star Wars can perform. Right after the film ended, he asked if we could watch it again, and was delighted when I told him there were still 2 more movies to go. We have watched them all now, finishing \\"Return of the Jedi\\" last night....and now he wants to watch them all again starting tonight. Sure, Lucas changed some of the scenes, added some stuff, but the magic is still there, just ask my six year old.there were still 2 more movies to go. We have watched them all now, finishing \\"Return of the Jedi\\" last night....and now he wants to watch them all again starting tonight. Sure, Lucas changed some of the scenes, added some stuff, but the magic is still there, just ask my six year old.

B00005O3VC|5.0|Monty Python never fails! Whether you are a fan of Python or just love British humor you will absolutely love this movie! It is certainly worth every penny because you will watch Holy Grail over and over again(each time hearing something hilarious that you didn't hear before!). Every single scene is packed with laughs, there is never a dull moment! I have seen everything that Python has done and this is without a doubt my favorite. The special features on the second disk are hilarious as well, Michael Palin and Terry Jones go back and visit all of the movie sets, and you can also see the behind the scenes film(complete with interviews) that aired on the BBC in the seventies. This movie will have you hystericaly laughing, and is a wonderful representation of the outrageous humor that has been keeping people laughing for decades!! You will not be disappointed with Monty Python and the Holy Grail, it is a classic comedy that anyone who likes to laugh should own!!!
1565123875|4.0|I usually read fantasy, science fiction, and young adult novels, not famous literary works or 'modern adult fiction' (which has got to be the most boring thing anyone could ever imagine).  I heard about this being famous, so I looked at the first chapter in a bookstore and knew I would love it and could buy it.  The prose has the best qualities of the best fantasy and YA novels.  It's lyrical and clear and makes everything you look at feel new and interesting and different, like the way you feel after you come out of a theatre after seeing a really really good movie.  The writing doesn't intrusively interpret or explain things for you.  The dialogue makes every character feel like a real person, three dimensional and distinctive.  If you like reading Diana Wynne Jones, Sandra Cisneros, Gregory Maguire, or Nina Kiriki Hoffman, you will like this novel.  I read it in 2 days during breaks at work and on the bus and staying up several hours later than I should.
B0002BK9J4|4.0|During the grunge heyday, Mondo Bizarro was a flashback to the early 80's recordings of Subterranean Jungle + Pleasant Dreams. There are Top-40 moments (Poison Heart, Touring) to semi-political Cabbies on Crack, and an unusual cover of The Doors \\"Take It As It Comes.\\" However, the best of the collection is \\"Tomorrow She Goes Away\\" a great song about a love that hs ran its course. The CD has good production, sound quality + an overall nice addition to any CD collection.
B00005JMUA|4.0|Volume 2 - a tremendous completion to Volume 1.  If you like this genre of movie, you will like Volume 2.  A perfect blend of fight scenes, revenge motifs, great music and camera work that is the best Quentin has ever done.  This is his best work in the past five years.  Take this review for what it is worth, but this movie is definitely worth seeing, and definitely worth buying.  The 30 minute 'making of volume 2' is a great look at how the movie was made, and the director's thoughts.  Check it out.
B000002KXV|5.0|Ask those who follow the music industry closely and they will tell you that Donald Fagen's \\"The Nightfly\\" is clearly one of the great albums of the last 25 years.     Currently there is an artist on the music scene named Norah Jones who has gained some fame with a retro/jazz sound.   While Jones does a nice job on this, Fagan does it even better on this album.  Donald Fagen's \\"The Nightfly\\" brings the jazz/blues sound to the forefront, but takes it a step further.  \\"The Nightfly\\" also is a concept album.  In the CD's liner notes, Fagen says that the songs on this album \\"represent certain fantasies that might of been entertained by a young man growing up in the remote suburbs of a northeastern city during the late fifties and early sixties\\".  When you listen to the songs on this collection, you will easily see how the theme flows through - and as a result, this enhances the listening experience.    Fagen assembles an outstanding lineup of musicians to work with him on this solo effort.  While Fagen plays piano and synthesizers on many of the tracks, he also gets some help from acclaimed keyboard player, Greg Phillinganes.  Phillinganes is best known for co-writing on several albums with Lionel Richie.   Phillinganes contributes keyboards on 6 of the 8 tracks.   The late Jeff Porcaro - from Toto (ironically \\"Toto IV\\"  won the Grammy for Album of the Year in 1982 and \\"The Nightfly\\" was denied any awards) contributes drums on 5 of the 8 tracks.   Valerie Simpson - from Ashford and Simpson contributes some outstanding background vocals on 5 of the tracks.  Finally, guitarist Rick Derringer is on 2 tracks.   These musicians do a simply outstanding job at making this the great album that it is, however don't underestimate Fagan.   Fagen's unique vocals and crooning style are the real star of this show.      \\"The Nightly\\" might only have 8 tracks, but remember that this collection was released a couple of years before CDs really hit the mainstream.  But it is worth noting that four of the eight songs are over 5 minutes in length.  Here is a breakdown of each of the songs:    \\"I.G.Y.\\" is the opening track and the best known song.  This is a 6:05 minute track and it is a masterpiece.   Phillinganes electric piano combined with Fagen's synthesizers mesh perfectly with some terrific horn work (Fagan integrates a trumpet along with an alto, tenor, and baritone sax).  As a result, the music is perfect for the retro/jazz feel.   This is an interesting song from a lyrical standpoint because Fagen paints a picture of the future of the world from the perspective of a young man growing up in the 50s.    \\"Green Flower Street\\" from a music standpoint isn't quite retro, but Fagen does some nice crooning and gives it the retro feel from a vocals standpoint.     The music is very catchy on this song and makes for some terrific listening.    \\"Ruby Ruby\\" is another song that has a terrific combination of keyboards, horns, and vocals.   It almost has a bit of an \\"alley cat\\" feel to it.    Definite retro feel to it.  Fagen describes a girl named \\"Ruby\\" who that the young man from the 1950s was infatuated with.    \\"Maxine\\" almost has a feel going back to the roaring twenties from the way the song opens.    Here's another song where Fagen uses all three saxaphones (Baritone, Alto, and Tenor).   This song also features a young man is infatuated with a woman - in this case someone named Maxine.  Listen to how Fagen switches gears with the vocals - especially when he sings \\"Mexico City is like another world\\".   I believe Fagen does all the vocals in this song and he harmonizes them perfectly.    \\"New Frontier\\" takes us into the early 60s and the days of the bomb shelters.  The vocals say \\"A Summer smoker underground - It's just a dugout that my dad built - In case the reds decide to push the button down\\", but Fagen explores other areas as well such as the modern woman (advent of the woman who has it all).   This song like \\"Green Flower Street\\" is going to have some very catchy music.  You'll also hear some harmonica playing that adds a nice touch to this song.    \\"The Nightfly\\" is title track and it is appropriate - this is the song that is the glue that holds the whole album together.   I get the impression that the young man that Fagen references (in the liner notes) having the fantasies is 'Lester the Nightfly' (whom he sings about).  This song is a song about DJ (Lester) who sings about Jazz and Conversation.   After all, isn't this what this album is about - a combination of jazz music and conversation themes (i.e. romance, the bomb, the future, etc).   Great retro feel to this song.  The background vocals - especially the call letters 'WJAZ' are awesome.    \\"The Goodbye Look\\" is a very underrated song on this collection.   This is a song that has a Latin Jazz feel.   No doubt, Fagen is singing about Havana, Cuba - once a vacation paradise now in the hands of the communists is place where 'the embassy has been hard to reach'.      Great song and in a lot of ways might be the strongest track on the collection.    \\"Walk Between the Raindrops\\" is the shortest track at 2:38.  I consider this the weakest track, but even this isn't all that bad.  It has a nice catchy beat to it.  Another great retro feel with a \\"Miami flare\\".    The liner notes contain all of the lyrics as well as giving credit to the outstanding musicians that contribute to this album.  As mentioned above, Fagen notes (in the liner notes) the common theme that runs through this album.   This is a collection that stands the test of time.  If you are a music fan, you'll want this music as a part of your collection.    A must have!
0812550706|5.0|This book is set in the future where families are given money to send two children into school. If they have more than two children they have to pay for their education which has an extremely high price. There is one exception to this rule. That is if your children are chosen and signed over at birth to be observed and possibly put into the military. Ender, Peter, and Valentine three siblings all had this privilege. From birth they were watched and each has failed. Each has received word that they were not accepted into the military program. When the youngest child Ender was six he was sent word that he was not accepted, the entire family was let down. It was unheard of to have three children and a disappointment that he was not accepted. In reality, this bad news was the last test before he was accepted into the program. They wanted to see his response to such a shock. The next day they showed up and told him that he was accepted into Battle School. Ender was seen as the genius, the impossible one that they had to mold. Mold him to make him the greatest leader that could defend our planet against buggers. Graff the \\"principle\\" of the battle school had a feeling about Ender and is going to do everything in his power to make Ender that leader. The leader that will not ask for help, make the best decision, and win the war.  <br /> This six year old was taken from his family and the people he loved, shipped off to a place where he was ridiculed for being too smart and made the out cast. With the help of Graff and Dap his officer in charge, Ender will hopefully become a powerful military leader. He does this by playing games, rising in the officer column and outwitting everyone with his mind. You will see how he works as the young boy who is out performing everyone at battles, hacking into computers, tactics and wisdom; and start hoping that he can achieve the highest goals that were set for him. <br /> This book is a very fast read, even though it is a sciencefiction book, it is brought to you with high hopes and an underlying meaning. Always work as hard as you can. You start to fall for this young boy placed in a military school and you go through all his emotions as if you were him, you get angry at Graff who is pushing him too far but at the same time you are hoping he is right and can help show Ender who is really is inside. This book is an amazing read for any age level, and I hope that you can experience the life of Ender some time soon. <br />
0671027387|2.0|I read Digital Fortess, and then Deception Point.  After reading Digital Fortess, deception was absolutely no fun.  The plot is easily predicted because whenever the author doesn't tell you something, he is trying to trick you.  I knew how the book was going to end even before I was half way done with it.
B00005JMYI|5.0|We take you back into the 1970's during the time of popular news channels, to a place where Ron Burgundy the local anchorman for channel 4 news team of San Diego existed. The other members of the team are Brian Fantana the field reporter, Champ the sports reporter, and Brick the weatherman. Families would sit around the television at night and watch to the news together; there was a connection between Ron and the people of San Diego. Everything was perfect for the channel 4 news team. <br />Then the unexpected happened, the men with power thought an addition to the news team was important. Veronica Corningstone came to the channel 4 news team and she started up a few disputes among other members of the team. At this time it was which member of the team could get with Veronica. Then after Ron's dog was kicked off of a bridge by an angry biker, Veronica had to step in when Ron did not show up to report the evening news. She performed amazingly and the reviews soared. They wanted more and she was made Co-Anchor. This created drama for the channel 4 news team. Instead of wanting to score, they were concerned of getting her off of the air. Even through many struggles between Ron and Veronica a romance started to blossom. <br /> Throughout this movie you will notice yourself laughing at almost every scene. This movie feels like your watching a live comedy show, filled with scenes about rivalries between news teams, street fights, immature name-calling and so much more. Upon leaving the movie theater, you will also notice that you are repeating lines from the movie. Because the movie was directed towards the adolescent and young adult age group the quick comebacks and cheesy lines are what helped this movie go to the top.  <br /> If you enjoyed movies such as Zoolander, Old School, Van Wilder, than this is your type of movie. Anchorman is about a two hour comedy made up of improv, clever lines, and quick comebacks. It hooks you to the humor at the beginning and you don't lose interest throughout the entire movie. You are there to laugh and it does an amazing job at this. Some of the present comedic actors appear in this film. The star of the movie is Will Ferrell, and there are appearances by Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, and Luke Wilson who all performed gracefully in a dramatic street fight. Another important guest star is Jack Black his humor is nothing short of what it was in School of Rock in his scene in this movie. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone. It is a great comedy that can lighten anyone's mood. I hope you can go out and see it soon, Stay Classy. <br /> <br />
B000059H99|3.0|Rocky is a Philadelphia man who boxes in small dives,when he's not out breaking thumbs.Somehow boxing champ Apollo Creed puts his gold up for grabs against Rocky kind of as a joke,he doesn't think an amatuer boxer is going to be able to hold his own against the champ.Of course Rocky comes through and becomes the new heavyweight champion to much surprise to everyone.Along the way Rocky finds love in a shy pet store clerk Adrian.A classic movie about the underdog rising to the challange and coming out on top.
B00005V9HH|5.0|The story has twists and turns every which way, the performances are great all around, its suspensful and even if you know the ending before you see it, it will surprise you.  Its got some comedy, some drama, even alittle action (not much, but this is a suspense crime film).  Its truely one of the best crime films ever made, worthy of quite a few oscar noms at least, and i agree with it winning for screenplay and supporting actor.  9 out of a 10.
B00006JIA4|4.0|Queen's Platinum Collection is a three disc set of 51 songs.Queen is a great band,but out of the 51 songs there is a lot of songs that don't really represent the best Queen has to offer.Disc 1 entitled \\"Greatest Hits 1\\" is a similiar to the version of Queen's Greatest Hits that was released by Elektra in 1981 on LP,with a few substitutions,and a couple songs resequenced.The Elektra version of Greatest Hits from 1981 is still the best version of Queen's Greatest Hits,why couldn't they have just issued that version on CD,but anyway Disc 1 contains the majority of Queen's biggest radio hits.Disc 2 \\"Greatest Hits 2\\" is pretty much the same as \\"Classic Queen\\" except Bohemian Rhapsody was already on the first disc,and \\"Tie Your Mother Down\\" has been replaced.Both versions contain 17 songs though,and this disc has the remainder of big hits that weren't on disc 1.Disc 3 or Greatest Hits III is just kind of an odd and sodds leftover disc, with a few hits from Queen's final album, and alternate versions of earlier hits with different vocalists.While the Platinum Collection would be a great purchase for the casual fans,I must recommend most of Queen's original albums instead or in addition to this collection.Every album up to 1980's the Game is classic.
B00005JMJG|2.0|for being creative and original, but the rest of the movie is just not worthy of being made into a movie.  Its has no theme, no deep meaning, it doesnt say its better to have loved and lose then never loved at all, it says what if? you loved and losed what if? you had your memories erased to make yourself feel better How would you feel after that?, but it never answers those questioned.  The performances are ok, the story is creative and original, but all thats wasted on pointless unaffectionate love crap that means didly.  If you like chick flicks and want to see something original not, i love you, but you love him, and he loves her and blah blah blah, then this is for you.  I just think they should have tapped the people more, and not an emotion that they are striving for, i cant feel for love, i can feel for people who love and loose it, but an emotion exists to someone and in a movie their emotions dont just spill into the viewer so we have to relate to the characters.  3 out of a 10 for an original view, but its wasted on meaninglessness.
B000001FKY|5.0|In 1987 when Def Leppard finally released their follow up to Pyromania,some fans where probably shocked and disapointed when they heard Hysteria. With Hysteria Def Leppard polished their sound a bit and wrote songs with more melody than before, in other words Hysteria isn't a hard rock record like Pyromania was instead Hysteria goes for more of a pop sound,increasing the number of female fans,with songs like Animal,Love Bites,Armaggeddon It,Hysteria,and Pour Some Sugar on Me.A lot of guys liked Hysteria too, the change didn't hurt their fanbase for any fans lost,Def Leppard gained new ones to.Everybody knows Pour Some Sugar on Me,that's probably their best known song to the youth of today.Every dance I went to in high school(in the late 90's)Pour Some Sugar on Me was played.Def Leppard never disappoints,so go buy yourself a copy of Hysteria today.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Yes, I have the VHS Special Edition, and some of the changes in this DVD set are not to my liking.  I did not like the substitution of the hologram in the final portion of the film, where Anakin, Yoda and Obi-Wan appear.  But, this DVD set, of pristine clarity and great sound, deserves to be in every Sci-Fi's collection.  Watch the films, and then the documentary on the bonus DVD and appreciate the tremendous impact these films had on film making.  I saw the original movies in the theater when they came out;  the special edition films in the theater when they came out, and now I have a superb DVD set of the three movies.  Allow George Lucas to refine his vision of the films as technology allows;  the budget for these films when they were made was extremely small compared to even the cost of mediocre movies today.  These movies were groundbreaking movies, and this DVD set is a fine way to celebrate those films. In these movies, things were being asked in the way of special effects that had never been tried before and was truly pioneering. For those who will wail over every single change --well, get over it.  It is not your film!
B00000099Y|4.0|i'm sorry, i just got done reading secretary's review for this album.  anyone who refers to styles of music he/she doesn't like as \\"nerdy\\" should rise themselves out of the high school frame of mind and start respecting other people who might like this kind of music (and may not like being called names because of it).   <br /> <br />that being said, this person does make a few good points.  first off, tool may be a GREAT band, but there ARE better bands out there.  i agree that adam jones is not that great a guitar player (though i think justin is an excellent bassist).  i read in his ashlee simpson review that he enjoys dillenger escape plan, whom i would say is one of the bands that is better than tool.  i even believe their drummer is better than danny carrey (if you don't believe me, check that dude out).   <br /> <br />some of his comments on maynard made some sense too.  he really IS NOT one of the better lyric writers in music right now...for that, you need to look into some alt/indie rock.   <br /> <br />now for the good.  this album is incredibly well written.  they did NOT put the extra odd tracks on the album to please anyone...  artistic expression, i would say.  and if you don't think it's artistic, well, that's your opinion.  no one can be arrogant enough to say something someone else does isn't art.  it's art if they want it to be art.  sure, some of it is annoying (that ions track gives me a headache).  but surely someone is interested by it.   <br /> <br />the singles on this album sound much like the non-singles, which is usually unheard of.  stinkfist sounds very similar to eulogy, the former being a single, and the latter is not.   <br /> <br />the talent involved on this album is not quite what it is on lateralus, but it's still quite good.  i like how the album doesn't sound like it was well produced.  to me, it sounds more raw that way.   <br /> <br />anyway, reviewing this cd is pretty much pointless, because anyone who is going to buy this album probably already has it.  i just had to get some stuff off my chest.   <br /> <br />
B00003CXAA|5.0|(This review is for The Godfather DVD Collection (2001) [ASIN: B00003CXAA])      1. THE FILMS    It would be unfair of me to write such short review for all the 3 films but I have to due to make this review as useful as possible.    The films are legendary, very popular & highly-regarded by both critics & people. Great films with great acting (by Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton & Talia Shire among many others), great score/soundtrack (by Nino Rota & Carmine Coppola) with many popular songs, great script based on a great novel (by late Mario Puzo), great cinematography (by Gordon Willis), great atmospheres... et al.    Some of my favorite bits about these films includes: the outstanding performances by Marlon Brando, Al Pacino & Robert De Niro, the scene with Woltz in bed (Part I) & the long scene with Fanucci walking the street (Part II). Another thing I like about The Godfather Trilogy is how it was less about crime and more about family. It's also exciting to see how Coppola did focus on family in real life (just like the film itself) by using them in these films.    The least favorite to most people would be Part III as it wasn't good enough. It actually was a good conclusion to the trilogy but was underrated because it didn't hold up to high expectations from the fans as well as to the great reputation of Part I & Part II. Al Pacino gave us another great performance. My guess is that it would've got a better reputation if the studio accepted Coppola's suggested title \\"Death of Michael Corleone\\".    Speaking of conclusions, a good conclusion to this review would be to praise Francis Ford Coppola's outstanding work from his great writing to superb directing to making such a great high-value DVD box set. Thank you Francis Ford Coppola.    Note: For a great review, check Emipre Magazine's article in issue 180 (June 2004) pages 166~167 (the article's called Masterpieces (#12)).    Godfather, The (1972) 5/5  Godfather:Part II, The (1974) 5/5  Godfather: Part III, The (1990) 5/5  __________________________________________________      2. THE DVDS    Here's an offer you can't refuse: buy this 5-disc Box Set because there never was an offer this good with a reasonable price.    Each film has its own DVD book-like keep-case with covers that shows respect to both the fans (especially the elder ones) and to the films too. Each film has an Aspect Ratio of 1.85:1, Closed-captioned, English & French audio tracks both Dolby Digital 5.1 (no DTS) & subtitles. Each film comes with a great informative audio commentary by (Francis Ford) Coppola. Part I comes in a single disc, so does Part III, and Part II comes in 2 discs. This is a good thing yet bad thing. It's good because they cared to give us the highest quality yet it's bad because you'll have to stop and change the disc exactly after the long scene with Fanucci walking the street (a similar problem was with the 1st DVD edition of Godfellas (1990) were we had to flip it). So we have a total of 4 discs for the whole 3 films plus a disc of extras. Godfather Part I (alone) is already out on DVD (which comes in a keep-case) and I guess Part II & Part III are coming shortly but those who buy each part apart would miss the extra stuff (listed below).    The 5th disc (the disc of extras/bonus stuff) comes with:  - A great documentary (73 min.) which is full of trivia and behind-the-scenes stories and footage.  - All the deleted-scenes.  - A look into Francis Coppola's Notebook which was his own guide to making the films.  - Cool rehearsal footage.  - Clips with Gordon Willis, Nino Rota, Carmine Coppola, Francis Ford Coppola, Mario Puzo & a short clip about locations.  - Academy Award acceptance speeches & list of awards.  - Corleone family tree.  And few more features (see DVD Features in the Product Details above or Technical Information also above).

B00005QIPH|1.0|well if you really wanna listen to this cd... dont bother buying it... just download one song from itunes and play it 11 times! TADA!  <br /> <br />i have one question for the strokes... <br /> IS THIS REALLY IT!?!?
B000002UJQ|5.0|This is an album I had to listen to hundreds of times to understand and even then I know I'm still missing pieces.  I've owned it for almost two years now and I am just beginning to appreciate the genius of three songs on the album that at first I didn't really get.  Climbing up the walls, no surprises, and lucky are (in my opinion) the best songs on the album.  This isn't because they are the best individually, but when listened to together they transition and compliment each other.  Climbing up the walls makes me imagine what it would be like to go insane.  The band does a great job at the end of this song letting everything go to pieces, Thom screaming, crashes and noises everywhere.  Normally this wouldn't work, but being the geniuses they are, it works beautifully.  And it makes the next song, no surprises, that much more powerful because instead of being incredibly dissonant (like climbing up the walls) no surprises is in a major key, so it is very soothing to the ears.  This song is in a major key, but it leaves a bittersweet taste in the mouth,  a resigned feeling of sardonic hopelessness...\\"such a pretty house and such a pretty garden...no alarms and no surprises.\\"  This sets the stage perfectly for Lucky.  Going from sadness to restrained optimism.  Lucky may just be the most moving song I know since it depicts my philosophy of life better than any thing else I can imagine.  Standing on the edge of conventionality, of thought, of everything...i can't even describe it. <br /> <br />bottom line...buy this album, then listen to it 10, 100, a 1000 times.  and maybe somewhere along the way you'll begin to understand...like i did.
B00005JM0B|4.0|When I went to see this movie in the theater I went in wanting to hate it because James Cameron wasn't involved. And to actually make a Terminator movie without Cameron just seemed so wrong. To my surprise I came out loving it, and I think the reason is you can tell that the people who made this movie were actually fans of the first two films. Jonathan Mostow does a wonderful job of keeping it faithful to the others but at the same time offers us something new. Adding Nick Stahl and Claire Danes to the cast was actually a really smart move. They have wonderful chemistry on screen together. And even though Nick Stahl looks nothing like Edward Furlong he actually does a better job in here than Furlong did in Terminator 2 so you have no problem believing that this is John Connor.  Arnold is his usual Terminator self. He's good in it but that's because he's playing a robot, but Arnold is a robot so it couldn't have been that hard for him to do. The new villain in the film is a female Terminator, which seems like a cornball idea but it actually works. I wouldn't say she's a better villain that the T-1000 but she is, at least, as interesting of a villain. Even though I hate it when movies go beyond three films I would actually like to see another one. The ending of the movie (which I LOVE!) really closes, what you could call, the first three chapters but leaves it open for a new kind of Terminator film. Of course I won't tell you the ending but in my opinion this one had a better ending than all of the Terminator movies. There's a lot of humor in the movie but it doesn't take away the dark feel of the film. I suppose Terminator 2 had some humor but in the \\"humor department\\" Terminator 3 exceeds it in many ways. Not all of the jokes work but most of them do and the ones that do make you forget the ones that don't.  The special features on the DVD are okay, but nothing really special. I wish there would have been some kind of documentary on all three films, plus all the novels, graphic novels, video games and what not. Maybe even interviews with James Cameron, Jonathon Mostow, and the cast and crew.  I think that's something the fans of the Terminator movies would have really love to see. The commentaries are pretty interesting, especially the one with Jonathon Mostow by himself. There is another commentary with the cast, which is okay, but when Arnold talks it hurts my ears. In the end this was a movie I really thought would suck, but while I was watching it I actually got the same feeling I got from the first two films. I can't say it's a better movie than the first two because truthfully it's not, but it is worthy of them. I'm a diehard fan of the Terminator movies, and I believe that the people involved with this movie were too.
B0002UXBD6|5.0|I had heard about how great their new CD was going to be and I didn't consider myself and big fan of punk music but I thought I would give it a try, plus I liked American Idiot. The CD blew me a away it was great. I am definitly pround to put it in my CD collection... Grab it if you haven't already!!!
B000001Y9I|4.0|Deep Purple is not one to go joking around their job. If they lose (or fire, whatever) a star guitarrist like Ritchie Blackmore, they do not go for some \\"Unknown talent\\" or \\"a diamond on the rough\\". Nothing like this for them. They went after one of the masters, Steve Morse. And Morse fits perfectly. For most of his career a solo act, he is not an ego maniac, he proves that he can work in a band. The result is the stellar PURPENDICULAR, the best, I repeat, the best DEEP PURPLE album since their comeback in 1984.
1551112434|4.0|This book, the first detective novel written, is a great combination of the eloquence of the Victorian novel and the entertainment of a mystery novel. Collins' main characters of Gabriel Betteridge and Franklin Blake are immensely likeable and there's a good deal of humour here as well. The only complaint I have about the novel is that it's entirely anti-climactic. Most of the suspense comes near the middle of the novel and you'll spend a good portion of the latter part of the novel with a pretty solid idea of who the culprit is. Overall, though, a very good read.
B00005QG9J|5.0|It's funny because Incubus's Brandon Boyd, lead singer, and Jose Pasillas, drummer, went to elementary school together.  In 1990 when they were in eighth grade, Jose met Mike Einziger, who is now the lead guitarist.  The three of them met Alex Katunich freshman year in high school and they randomly decided to start playing together just for fun. <br />After a while they started to have the whole neighborhood coming around to watch and listen to them play.  Everybody thought that they were amazing and that was the spark that ignited them to become a band.  They began writing their own music and it seemed to come natural to them.  Their first song was entitled, \\"Love Sick.\\"  The main reason they liked the song so much was because it had a sense of funk to it yet it still had that rock element in it as well.  <br />Incubus was formed in 1991 in the San Fernando Valley suburb of CA, group members Brandon Boyd, Mike Einziger, Alex Katunich ,and Jos Pasillas were all tenth grade classmates when they got together.  At the time, they were all crazy Red Hot Chilli Pepper fans, which you can definitely tell by their music now that the Chilli Peppers were a majore influence.  By the time they had all graduated from high school they had been playing gigs all over southern California.  Their first actual album was released in 1997,  it was just a demo with six songs on it, but you could tell they were well on their way to stardom.   <br />I would definitely have to say that Incubus's album \\"Morning view\\" is their best album by far.  When they first started out they combined funk with metal and created a type of music that was very diverse.  With this album it's definitely not as hard core as their previous ones.  Incubus has been around for many years and up until this album came out I wasn't even that big a fan.   <br />Actually I never even listened to them up until I saw them in concert.  My friend Ashley had an extra ticket to go see them one year and she asked me to go soI just went for the hell of it.  I don't think I've ever seen a performance that intriguing in my life, I was fixated the whole time.  I ended up loving them and from that day on I was hooked.  I immediately went out and bought this CD.  I think that their work is amazing; they have so much great talent including that of the lead singer Brandon Boyd.  He has the most amazing voice, and he can change it to basically any pitch.  He can go from high to low in a matter of seconds.  His voice is so intriguing that right when you hear it you're hooked, you fall in love with him.  <br />This album has some of their harder stuff along with the more melodic songs.  Starting off with \\"Nice to Know You\\" and ending with \\"Aqueous Transmission\\" gives the album a great shift in mood.  Each song on the CD has a different meaning behind it whether it's trying to get someone back that you once loved or it's just so hard core rock that it makes you think of an explosion when you hear it.  That is mainly contributed by the guitarist Michael Einziger, he is amazingly talented and he tears up the stage in every performance.  He can play everything from hard rock to acoustic.  I would have to say that even though I don't know much about guitars and that kind of stuff, I know enough to say that Michael Einziger rocks and that is one of the main reasons I would recommend buying this album!  <br />
B000002NCW|4.0|This is a pretty good record. <br /> <br />It can however be a bit boring, if you are not in the mood to this kind of music. <br /> <br />I think it is worth a buy.
0064409422|5.0|C.S. Lewis was born in Belfast, Ireland in 1898.  Right off the bat as a young child he loved to read.  His parents had somewhat of a library collection at home and he would go through and read whenever he got a chance. During his lifetime Lewis fulfilled three very different vocations.  There was, first, Lweis the distinguished literary scholar; second, Lewis, the highly acclaimed author of science fiction and children's literature; and thirdly, Lewis, the popular writer of Christian apologetics.  Though Lewis published many works in his time, he was famous for his fiction and Christian apologetics.  I would have to say that his most famous collection was in children's literature which was the Narnia series.  This series includes \\"The Magician's Nephew,\\" \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe,\\" \\"The Horse and his Boy,\\" \\"Prince Caspian,\\" \\"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader,\\" \\"The Silver Chair,\\" and \\"The Last Battle.\\"   I found \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" to be one of the most fascinating books I've ever read. <br /> This is a truly amazing story, not only for children but for adults as well.  He writes with the style that is mostly geared towards young children.  Yet at times you will see that he is gearing towards adults as well.  The plot is right to the point and easy to follow with a simple resolution at the end.   <br /> For anyone that is religious at all it is quite easy to pinpoint the religious aspects of the novel.  You will see that throughout the story Lewis refers to the children and the sons and daughters of Adam and Eve.  As well as adding in random religious symbols such as statues, spirits, and so on. <br /> The four main characerters in the novel are Peter, the oldest and the one who seems to mature the most once experiencing the journey through Narnia, Susan, the second oldest and basically the mother figure towards all of them, Edmund who is third in line and definitely the least mature out of everyone, and then Lucy, the baby of the groupwho was the first to originally discover Narnia. <br /> For the children the wardrobe is shown to be a cool secret passage into another world, Narnia.  He puts together fantasy with some realism to create a story that children will love.  Children can relate it to themselves in an everyday sense, comparing themselves with the children in the story.  For instance, they start off the story simply playing hide and go seek, then the youngest of the children decides to hide in an old wardrobe and ends up entering into a secret world.   <br /> Once she returns the others do not believe her when she tells of where she went.  So you see it relates to siblings everyday because that is usually the case in most families.  All in all the story is great for children and adults and I would recommend it to anyone who likes fantasy stories.  I think there are many points that Lewis is trying to bring across with this book.  For instance, good moral living among children, showing them the difference between right and wrong.  Once you pick it up, you won't put it down.  <br />
B0000DZ3EN|1.0|So many reviewers have written how this sequel is closer to the spirit of the Oz books than the original movie.  I vehemently disagree.  Baum's Oz sequels are fun, simple, whimsical, and often silly.  Does Dorothy smile even once in \\"Return\\"?  I think one forced smile at the end. <br /> <br />F. Balk is very good as Dorothy otherwise (considering that she had to fill in for Judy Garland's legendary performance).  But this is a compeletely joyless movie. <br /> <br />It is beyond my comprehension that it took 45 years to make a sequel, and this is what they came up with.  Atrocious.  MGM's \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" is near perfect, and this movie nears a complete disaster.   <br /> <br />In Fact, the only thing that is worthy of the land of Oz in entertainment form since \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" is the new Broadway musical \\"Wicked.\\"  Finally something that makes Oz sense.

In addition, also consult Michael's website  with about five sections of evidence that was compiled.   <br /> <br />Now after reading that, show me your evidence that rebuts Mr. Moore's evidence. <br /> <br />Thank you and good night. <br />Jason
B0002234LS|3.0|I enjoyed this film mainly for its pure entertainment value and it's unapologetically bleak ending which was a bit refreshing to me.  Depp, as always, gives a stellar performance and the supporting actors are also top notch although they're never really given a chance to shine.  Depp is the star here. Secret Window is a bit predictable (I wasn't surprised one bit by the \\"twist\\" ending), a bit unbelievable (call the police, move out, kill the guy, whatever and wouldn't most writers have copies of their published works on hand?) and typically Stephen King: high on suspense, low on substance.  It's a good friday or saturday I-have-nothing-better-to-do-wrapped-up-in-a-blanket-with-the-lights-out-eating-popcorn kind of scary movie.  Take it for that because, like most Hollywood horror suspense films, that's all you're going to get.  Fun but a bit predictable.
B0001US62I|4.0|Mickey Rourke is a small-time private detective hunting for the whereabouts of a missing man on behalf of secretive client played by Robert DeNiro. A trail of gruesome murders and black magic take him from New York to New Orleans, to an alluring voodoo priestess played by Lisa Bonet and a truly shocking end. <br /> <br />Not for children or young teens - the original (uncut) version was edited to avoid an NC-17 rating due to explicit sex scene, and murders are of a brutal nature. However, the uncut version is definitely better than R-rated. Scenes are not gratuitous - this a very dark, creepy tale of evil with enough mystery that you want to watch to the very end to find out just what the hell is going on.  <br /> <br />Excellent acting by Mickey Rourke - nobody else had the acting intensity to play this character in my opinion.  <br /> <br />Good use of sinister lighting and images to give film a darker, creepier aspect throughout.
6302529867|5.0|K2 is not the world's tallest mountain (as everyone knows, Mt. Everest is) but it is the world's deadliest.  It is the second-tallest mountain but climbing it is far more challenging than climbing Mt. Everest.  It has the most deaths of any 8000+ metre mountain in the world.  The fatality rate of climbers attempting to summit K2 is about 50%.  As of early 2004 only 198 people had summited K2, while over 1700 have summited Mt. Everest.<br /><br />This movie is about an attempt to summit K2.  I've read the other reviews of this movie and I'd like to stress a few additional points.  First, this is the best movie I've ever seen about high-altitude mountain climbing.  Second, while the characters are \\"fictional\\", they are actually based on real-life mountaineers.  Those who know the history of high-altitude climbing will recognize some of the real-life characters reflected in the movie.  Third, while the story is not strictly true, it is in fact a composite of various actual events that have occurred over a number of summit attempts.  The events as depicted are very realistic, and give the armchair viewer some sense of what it must be like to tackle one of the world's greatest physical challenges.<br /><br />This is more than just a \\"guy-buddie\\" movie.  It's more than just an adventure movie.  It's more than a semi-documentary about high-altitude climbing.  It says something about why we humans, or some of us, strive for almost-impossible, \\"crazy\\" accomplishments.  It portrays the characters realistically, with their strengths and their weaknesses.  The movie brought tears to my eyes.  I found it profoundly impactful and deeply moving.  I strongly recommend it for anyone interested in why and how people test themselves to their limits.<br /><br />Karl Weaver
B000002GK1|5.0|Grunge was just another trend that came and went.  Even though the professional music critics cherished grunge and tried to make it into something more than it was, it was still just another aggressively marketed trend by corporations seeking to maximize their profits.  It was no different from the glam metal before it or the rap metal that followed it.<br /><br />Just like every other genre in the musical spectrum, the majority of grunge was crap.  Of course record companies don't want you to realize that because they want you to buy in bulk rather than a single unit.  That's how they stay filthy rich.<br /><br />In the grunge genre, Nirvana, Mudhoney, and Screaming Trees were mediocre at best, Pearl Jam, Alice In Chains, and Green River were very boring, and bands like Stone Temple Pilots, Bush, Candlebox, and Everclear were god-awful.  The two gems of that whole scene turned out to be a couple of the first bands of the genre- the Melvins and Soundgarden.<br /><br />\\"Badmotorfinger\\" was Soungarden's peak.  While Nirvana and Pearl Jam were handed their attention by MTV and radio in late '91 and `92, Soundgarden were working their butts off touring the country and tearing up small venues with Danzig and Pantera to support this great album.  You may hear \\"Outshined\\" played on the radio every now and then, but back in '91 and '92 it that song never saw the light of day.  It goes to show that you cannot be a legend in your own time.<br /><br />There isn't one second of filler on \\"Badmotorfinger.\\"  Even though the two strongest tracks, \\"Rusty Cage\\" and \\"Outshined,\\" open the album, it never sinks into mediocrity.  Whether they're crawling along with ultra-heavy sludge like \\"Slaves and Bulldozers\\" or in attack mode with the driving guitars on \\"Jesus Christ Pose,\\" they never fail to keep your attention.<br /><br />The cherry on top of Soundgarden's already great sound is Chris Cornell's raven like voice.  His voice is as unique as Danzig's, but still has a very traditionalrock n' roll type delivery.  Then, there are the intelligent lyrics to make the whole effort worthwhile.<br /><br />Soundgarden would eventually succumb to the mainstream grunge sound and do what was expected of them, which made them extremely famous.  However, for their first three albums, they made some of the best stripped down, intelligent heavy metal ever.
1577314808|5.0|This is the best book I've ever read. It has changed my life. I've been reading it for five years and stlll haven't finished it. I read a paragraph or even a sentence each day and have to put it down and think about it. For about eighteen months, I was stuck on one sentence on page 155 of the hardcover: \\"To offer no resistance to life is to live in a state of grace, ease, and lightness.\\" That's worth pondering. In the last year or so, I've moved on to page 156: \\"The happiness that is derived from some secondary source is never very deep. It is only a pale reflection of the joy of Being, the vibrant peace that you find within as you enter the state of nonresistance. Being takes you beyond the polar opposites of the mind and frees you from dependency on form....\\" Brilliant words. Maybe you'll respond differently, but there almost certainly will be something in this book that will speak to your heart and even change the way you experience your life and your world.
B00003CXCT|4.0|I'm docking this 1 star beacuse there is only one disc of Special Features. One Special Features disc per film would have been preferable, like the EI and EII DVD's. However, between the multiple (awesome) animated menus, audio commentaries, 2.5 hr. documentary, 'Lightsaber' & 'Characters' Featurettes & easter egg Blooper Reel, this is worth the reasonable price tag (around $40 most places). Add to that the brilliant visual quality and completely 100% *new* sound mix and you have a solid debut for Episodes IV-VI, otherwise known as 'The Star Wars Trilogy'. <br /> <br />My DVD's had no technical glitches but most huge shipments like this have a few units of duds in them. Just return your set and get a new one - it's worth the trouble. <br /> <br />Since 1997, besides remastering the films & their audio, the poorly animated ANH Jabba has been redone *brilliantly*, Boba Fett has been revoiced by the actor who played Jango Fett in EII, and Hayden Christianson now appears as the resurrected Anakin Skywalker for continuity reasons yet unrevealed! The new changes are seamless and help integrate the sprawling 6 film epic. <br /> <br />One thing that is truly wonderful - for all the FX fans out there - almost all the matte artifacting (discoloration, green lines, white boxes etc.) are now 99% GONE. You really have to look for them to see them - it's really amazing. They look as seamless as the new films. <br /> <br />So: can't wait for the big 6 disc box set. A few Lightsabers still need fixing and the audio mix could use one more pass. Ti'l then: this is a must have. Enjoy!!
B0002234LS|2.0|This was a disappointment to me. It was like a half squeezed orange. The whole film could have been a little more sinister and a little more frightening. Even John Turturro, who usually turns in a stellar performance in whatever he does, did not have a real  presence in this film. I bet he did all of his scenes in one day and them left. I got the impression that Johny Depp did this one to pay the rent. They could have done a better job.
B0000C1HLF|2.0|Hot girls, lots of cleavage, good pop music, expensive toys, high production values & special effects. But most of all 4 chicks, all 10's on the babe meter. Make sure they wear just enough clothes so the 12 year old boys can get in the theater. Hey it's a summer movie. Now its on dvd. Plot? What's that? Bernie Mac has a few good lines. That's it.
0671449028|5.0|I bought this book for my 15 month old son for bedtime reading.  He absolutely loves the pictures and pointing to the animals.  We also read the book \\"I Love You As Much\\"  and \\"Goodnight Moon\\".  We read all three before bedtime and my son adores all 3 books.  I would tell parents of young children to really give this book a try to establish a bedtime ritual with their children, I know Dylan, my son, always looks forward to his bath, getting his pajamas on then cuddling with his blanket and getting his stories read to him.
B00000J7JO|5.0|I first starting listing to red Hot Chili Peppers about five years ago, and have loved every thing they have done since then.  I had heard their songs many times on the radio or on MTV, but never knew who they were.  One day sitting at my friend's house he put in a CD.  After listing to it for a couple of minutes I asked him who it was because I really liked it.  His first response was calling me and idiot, because I didn't know who the Red Hot Chili Peppers were.  After I started listening to them more, the more I agreed with him that I was an idiot for not having started listening to them sooner. <br />  They have a very unique sound compared to most similar sounding bands.  If you listen to them you know that you can always tell that it is a Red Hot Chili Peppers song from anything else.  They have a unique talent for making crazy beats, and lyrics.    <br /> Californication is a great CD because of its variety in lyrics and rhythms.  I'm sure you have bought an album before and not liked all of the songs on it.  This CD is not one of those.  Every song is great, and this CD has a great vibe to it.   All of the Lyrics are completely unique and abstract, but they sound so awesome.  Anthony's voice has something new about it in Californication.  His voice seems different form earlier CDs like it is more in tune with the music.   This gives a much smother sound to their songs, which is more appealing to more people, than thier previous albums.  It seems like the music in general comes together more.  Flea who plays bass is one of the best bass players out there, so it is difficult to match him with talent.  However John matches his skill level perfectly in this album they got together like spaghetti and meatballs in Californication, it's beautiful. <br /> This album is by far the most popular of all of the Red Hot Chili Peppers albums.  Its music videos were frequently played on MTV.  The music videos are so great because of the creativity of the band.  There creativity is directly shown from the music.  The general sound of a Red Hot Chili Peppers song is creative.  However this album is by far the most diversified and best change that they made.  <br /> The music on this album is great for listing to anywhere.  I personally love listening to it while working out, because of the great beat and intensity.  The majority of this album makes you want to just get up and do something however there are some songs that still have a great sound but are slower, and relaxing.  It seems that no matter what type of rhythm or beat the Red Hot Chili Peppers use they always pull off a great sound. <br /> This band has been around for longer than most people know.  They are from California, you might guess by the title of the album Californication.  They started as a group of metal head punks.  The turned themselves into a great empire, because of the beautiful music that produce.    <br /> I think that Californication is a must own album.  If you have listened to some of the songs you will no doubt agree with me.  I also recommend other of there albums such as Blood Sugar Sex Magic, By The Way, and Their Greatest Hits Album.  <br />
B0002VKZL6|3.0|I am a long standing Dire Straits fan and a fan of Mark's music generally, but this CD, no matter how fine the playing and wordsmithing, almost literally put me to sleep. <br /> <br />One really good guitar rave would have been enough, but no, we are denied. He just plays with something that you think, maybe, just maybe, this is going to take off. Doesn't happen. <br /> <br />Simply not worth spending the money.
B00005JL7Q|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies, it was so heart warming, I truly loved it, it just makes you happy inside to watch this film. Hugh Grant does such a great job as a pseudo- father figure...wow, just go out and rent it now
068987474X|2.0|Ok. I'll admit it...the guy is funny, and he has written a funny book. But, halfway through, in the midst of my laughter, I realized something: These are real women I am laughing at! This book is Mr. Behrendt's nice way of calling all of us women naive and silly, and he is going to be the one profiting from our supposed inability to \\"understand the male psyche\\"! Ladies, I can sum it up in one sentence: If you don't feel like the guy is crazy about you, and you spend hours analyzing every decision he makes (and making your friends do the same),then you probably deserve better. If you think you deserve flowers and romance and marriage, and he's not willing to offer it---go find a great guy that will. Yes, it is a funny book, but if you are looking for sound relationship advice, I just gave it to you for free.

B000002KDO|5.0|I think Master of Reality stands out as one of the greatest metal albums ever. Ozzy sold out to the media after this was recorded i believe. Ozzy isn't even worth talking about anymore, but there was a time when he was the singer for a great band. That band was Black Sabbath.  <br /> <br />Also, you cant beat the price amazon sells it for, so pick it up if you don't have this CD. you'll be glad you did.
B000059H99|5.0|Every person should see Rocky at least one time in their life.  It is by far my favorite movie ever and many people will agree it is a timeless classic.  From the cinematography all the way to the love story it is a beautiful piece of work.  This movie won three academy awards.  It won one for best picture, one for best editing and one for best director, and it well should have.  It was made by Sylvester Stallone who stars in it as Rocky Balboa.  The reason it is so appealing to me is the diversity in which the movie shows.  This movie has everything for a large range of an audience. It is rated PG because there is no crude language.  The only violence is the actual boxing.  It has of course great action sequences.  These scenes are achieved by the mastery camera angles.  Also these scenes would not have been so beautifully constructed with out great editing.  The fight scenes seem so perfect that any one can believe that Sylvester Stallone (Rocky) and Carl Weathers (Apollo Creed) were actually fighting each other.   <br />  Rocky is a collector for a mobster, because he is a natural born fighter.  He boxes at a local gym on the side because he loves boxing.  He is given the shot of a life time, to fight Apollo Creed the heavy weight champion in his home town of Philadelphia.  This where is any person can relate to the film.  Everyone has a dream were they would give everything for just one small chance one shot at it.  This is what Rocky is given, it's his one shot.  The passion that Rocky has for this sport is illustrated through his training scenes.  These scenes are probably the most famous scenes ever made.  They show a nobody, a street fighter become a real contender for the championship.  It shows Rocky running up the steps of the Philadelphia Art Museum, and throwing his hands in the air when reaching the top.  The way that the music progressively gets louder while he makes his way up is excellent.  This movie is equipped with an excellent sound track, whichperfectly complements the content of the scenes.  <br />What most people don't know is that this is not just a fight movie.  It revolves around a great love story also.  Rocky falls in love with possibly the shyest girl ever, named Adrian (Talia Shire).  She works across the street in a pet store were Rocky frequently visits to tell her a joke and pick up pet food.  He is friends with her brother Paulie, and he arranges a date.  Adrian asks Rocky why he fights, and his answer is one of the cleverest responses ever.  He tells her that he fights because he can't sing or dance.  Now some people might think it's just a joke, but he says this to explain his passion for the sport and show he was born for it.      <br />This is the type of movie that makes everyone feel great.  It will make everyone that watches it want to shoot for their dreams, and realize that no dream is too far for anyone to reach.  After the movie is over, and you turn the lights on, you will think you are Rocky.  You will feel on top of the world and will be smiling form ear to ear.  I recommend all of the Rocky movies.  I own all five and will with out a doubt recommend all of them.  However I truly feel that the first Rocky is the best, and always will be the best.  Not just the best out of the Rocky series, this is the best movie ever. <br />
0440237688|5.0|This book was very intriguing, and an excellent read.  I have read it several times and enjoyed it every time.  It's so bizarre to envision another world completely, one that we find the thought of appalling, but then see how we would be able to get used to it.  This book opens up an entire new realm of possibility.  It is extremely well written, and allows u to identify with Johan, the main character very well.  The book is about a \\"perfect\\" society, where everything is monitored, and everything is monotonous.  Only one person, The Giver, has the power to see outside the monotony, and Johan is selected to obtain this same power.  It is a fascinating book, and it even outshines Lois Lowry's other work.  It is well worth a read.
B0002Z0EYK|2.0|I had high hopes for this film, considering the cast, but alas, my friend and I made fun of this film out loud for entire 2 hour and 45 minute running time.  Funny things was, it was opening night, and the audience was laughing at all our jokes.  There should be a revival of Mystery Science Theatre 3000, because this film is great to tease.  Best joke invovled the sudden rush of flaming fire balls, and another involved Achilles yelling \\"Hector!\\"  Response: \\"Wrong castle, you idiot!\\" <br />Great movie to make fun of, but in the end, a really cheesy movie.

B0002OERI0|5.0|This album is a perfect display of free speech; something every true patriot would have respect for. None of the Green Day members are from a foreign country, so I don't understand the review in which the author told them to go back where they came from. They are from the Bay area in California. <br /> <br />Being a true patriot and agreeing with M. Kulis, the song American Idiot is not about being anti-American. Green Day is simply saying that they are not happy with the new American era in which the media plays an enormous part in brain washing people to believe what the government wants you to believe. Everyone has the God given right to believe in what they think is right and the American freedom to express it. Green Day never claimed to be conservative or Republican, so what is the harm in their views??? <br /> <br />All politics aside, this album rocks! Every song on the album has a lot of heart. It is not the same old Green Day, but I can tell you that you won't be disappointed. The new style is amazingly enchanting, and you won't want to get out of the car until the CD is over. <br />
B000268QB2|5.0|<br />When I first saw the \\"Somewhere Only We Know\\" video, I didn't like it that much. But then they played it a lot and I soon grew to like it. A month later I finally bought the CD. It was the best 10 bucks I ever spent. Every song on this album is flawless and takes my ears for a ride. I love everything about this, from the lyrics to the disc art to the awesome piano and drum playing. The lead singer has an **AWESOME** voice and kinda looks like someone from Lord Of The Rings. Hm. But anyway, buy this album if you don't have it yet. You will enjoy it guaranteed.
0060925000|5.0|Naming your favorite novel of all time must be approached with much caution, but I have to say that, after reading this gargantuan novel 15 years ago, no work of fiction has stayed dearer to my heart. A SUITABLE BOY is my favorite. Logging in at over 150 reader reviews, this book has obviously had enough said about it in these pages without me going into detail, but if you've ever read WAR AND PEACE then you know what it will be like to heave an epic like this onto your lap and lose yourself in a long, LONG reading experience that, you will never forget.
B0001HAISG|5.0|This is the best version of this classic that I have ever seen. <br />The casting and directing are flawless. My 3 year old daughter and I cannot get enough of this DVD.
B00003CXCT|5.0|First, let me say, that impressive, is not even close to the word that describes my first experience watching the DVD trilogy. Orgasmic, is closer, but not quite there yet. <br />I was raised on STAR WARS, and have been anticipating this release with great anxiety. Altough, I am not impressed with the new additions that Lucas has added to this flawless trilogy, I can say without a doubt that I will enjoy watching my children experience STAR WARS with the same captivating attraction that my parents watched with me. <br />It is obvious that Lucas is making the prequels up as he goes along, and it's a shame that he now has to alter the original story, and it's actors to fit a new bill. Lucas must take the fans for idots. Since the prequels were filmed nearly twenty years after the IV, V, VI, it stands to reason that Sebastian Shaw be viewed at the end of JEDI, since he is the approximate age that VADER would have been at his death. But, no, with special effects and editing, HAYDEN CHRISTENSEN was morphed into Shaw's image. This shows to me that Lucas is not a fan of his own  work, and is not impressed with his contribution, not only to the advancement of the film industry, but to pop culture as well. I would like to ask George Lucas to define perfection to me. What he has done to his original story is like buying a new car, and striping the paint down to the primer, and then repainting the car with a roller and brush.  I guess that a new IV, V, VI will be reissued when episode III is released, so that any more contradictions in episode III can be made right, and can be altered to fit a new trilogy. <br />Visual and Audio tracks are impressive, and flaunt off the obvious advantages of DVD over video. This is a must see, and is well worth the investment.
B00002E23E|3.0|Not so long ago, it could be said that this was the only official Zeppelin video available. With the release of the untitled Led Zeppelin DVD, however, that's no longer the case. Because of that, this particular video can now be enjoyed without having to worry about the documentary or \\"dream sequences\\" getting in the way of the live performance.     The live performance is pretty good, but, sadly, sounds somewhat sloppy and rushed in comparison to the wealth of material on the new DVD. Plant's voice even breaks unbecomingly at several points during a rather strained performance of \\"The Song Remains the Same.\\" And the \\"dream sequences\\"? Oddly enough, I find them kooky & charming, and they're actually the reason I still like this video. I--and many others, I'm certain--am particularly fond of the sight of the late, great John Bonham puttering about his farm and of Plant playing with his late son, Karac. There's something very melancholic about it, and I, at least, see no problem with that.     Approach only if you're a die-hard Zeppelin fan up for a bit of [Viking] fun, and if you've already gotten your hands on the new DVD and are, therefore, open to said [Viking] fun.
B00003CXCT|1.0|After looking forward to the release of these films for the past year, I am left seriously disappointed.  George Lucas seems to believe that poorly done CGI makes for compelling viewing.  I had read that there were only a few \\"minor\\" changes in this DVD set, a claim that is completely false.  Entire scenes with dancing CGI characters have been added (like the end of \\"Jedi\\"), and the background music in many of the scenes has been changed.  Particularly offensive is a scene in \\"Jedi\\" where the seedy lounge singer in Jabba the Hutt's place has been replaced by a \\"wacky\\" animated version straight out of Disney.  Puh-lease.  These versions make me yearn for our old copies taped off of HBO.  The bonus DVD is interesting, but the extensive reworkings of the original movies make this purchase a waste of money.  I would rather not own these movies on DVD at all than pay money for these pathetic substitutions.
0062502182|3.0|It is a good inspirational book but it doesn't depict the reality well(which is ok because it is a fiction anyway). Things are not always pleasant in life and neither is this a cinderella world. It's good to follow one's dreams but they may or may not come true. So, the moral should have been that you should try to follow your dreams but the rest is upto God instead of ending it with the moral that when you always get what you wish for.
B00005JNEI|2.0|I did not vote for George W. Bush in 2000 and I do not intend to vote for him in 2004. I am not fond of Kerry either and I wish we had a third alternative. I went into this movie with negative opinions about the Bush administration and assumed that I would find a kindred spirit with this film. However, aside from being an endurance test for the rational thinker, this film is biased and stilted to the extreme that it verges on yellow journalism and scaremongering. One gross example is from a news archive when Bush was informed of the second plane hitting the Twin Towers. The film clip has a voice-over with Mr. Moore's wild speculation as to what President Bush was thinking at that moment.  <br /> <br /> This is neither journalism nor a documentary. This is rapid speculation and conjecture and disallows for the viewer to develop their own opinion. Yes, the connections between favoured businesses, businessmen and world leaders is daunting and frightening, but presented in a format that is prejudiced and only presents details that support Mr. Moore's opinion. A documentary should recount history fairly and honestly, rather than supplant an accurate recording with supposition. <br /> <br />      As a film, it was poorly shot, tedious and waxed with Mr. Moore's personal opinion of self-importance. In journalism, and this is rated as a documentary, the presenter should never become the story and should never eclipse the story. Mr. Moore has done both and butted heads with the Canons of Journalistic Ethics. I am amused... and worried...that anyone watching this film could take it seriously. The issues proposed in the film are relevant and important BUT represent the views, opinions and scare tactics of Mr. Moore who is visibly heel-bent on the downfall of this administration.  <br /> <br /> Be afraid...be VERY afraid when so few people have so much power as to produce a film that has such a far reaching audience and there is no equal voice for opposition. This is apropaganda film disguised as a documentary and should not be viewed as an historical account.  <br />
B0000027G6|5.0|I have quite a few soundtracks in my collection, but this one is my absolute favorite.  I suffer with bipolar and in order to relax, I like to listen to something soothing and uplifting.  When I have this CD playing, I no longer feel depressed or anxious...I just feel good.  This is a great score to escape from the world.  Some other soundtracks I recommend, AFTER you purchase this one, are: Superman(John Williams), Stealing Home, Willow, The Blue Lagoon, Gladiator, Titanic, and Field of Dreams, and The Natural, just to name a few.  If you go through your whole life without listening to this CD atleast once, than you'll have really missed out.
B00007KWHP|5.0|When I first heard \\"Heart of the Sunrise\\" I was instantly hooked.  The mind blowing bass playing and intensity of the work put soul into the music.  It had been a while since something has blown my socks off as much Fragile has done.  The songs are shorter than most of their \\"epic\\" works such as \\"Close to the Edge\\" but still convey the same progressive meaning.  For the true fans of Yes it will be difficult to take any of this seriously, but like so many other fans we were not around from the start in came in later to the great sounds of Yes.   <br /> Fragile was my first Yes album and others might have been turned away from it.  I was amazed by the tremendous skill that went into this album.  The harmonics playing at the start of Roundabout seem to send you into a lull that you quickly wake up from and find yourself surrounded by the intense satisfaction of music satisfying all of your senses.  Rick Wakeman adds a new element to the ingenious styles of Yes.  It was an amazing album and will always be my favorite despite other critics of Yes.  Close to the edge maybe widely acclaimed through the Yes community but do not forget it was their best album on the charts.   <br /> Other than it being a great CD or record, depending on what era you began listening to Yes, it is a masterfully well done piece of work.  The band obviously wanted to show off some of their individual talents on this record.  Each member of the band has put together a whole song expressing their own individual talents that comprise the whole of the band.  In truth the part is almost as strong as the whole.  It seemed to me like Yes was a dream team of musicians that somehow came together to produce music of a higher caliber. <br /> The bands chemistry reminds me of sports team that will sacrifice their efforts to make the whole of the unit stronger than on its own.  Sure, superstars will emerge and some might take more of the glory for themselves, but Yes is an exception to the rule of money andthe pursuit of just making quality music and not caring about their critics.  That is while they were considered progressive because they strayed away from the mainstream bands and did not get caught up in all the hype that comes with success.  They were genuine and were true to their nature of performing great albums and putting on great shows for their fans. <br /> Fragile almost never comes out of my CD player and when it does it is only replaced with one of Yes's other albums.  My respect is greater for them not only because they made a great CD and were a band of the ages, but because even when the times changed and the music turned from its original roots you could still see the Yes in all of their works and their distinct sound and love for the music.  This band has been placed on the earth for one reason and that's to rock.  So if you like to rock and listen to great music by influential band of their time, then I suggest you check out Fragile by Yes.  If you were one who heard this album and did not like it, do not stray away from Yes but check out one of many of their great CDs.  Close to the Edge was one of their most influential CDs among the progressive genre, with epic songs on it. If you are as impatiently and try to hear different styles at a shorter length of time because our lives are so busy now, Fragile is the album to try then work your way up to the \\"epic\\" songs.  Wakeman was a great addition to this band for this CD and I was glad that his influence drives the whole CD no matter what your favorite instrumental part of the music you are listening too.   <br />
B00003CXCT|1.0|I really enjoyed this trilogy on dvd last week, with my nephews and they really had a good time watching the picture( for thier very first time), the picture and sound quality are amazing, but those changes made by lucas irritates me too much, but to the kids really liked it, and even they thought that is a continuity of the whole series, well. <br /> <br />but for the old fans there's nothing to ask for, you know why? <br /> <br />Because Lucas is never going to release the original versions on DVD anymore!!!! <br /> <br />here is an extract of an interview in cnn: <br /> <br /> <br />_______________________________________ <br />Question: Why not release both the originals and special editions on DVD? <br /> <br />LUCAS: The special edition, that's the one I wanted out there. The other movie, it's on VHS, if anybody wants it. ... <br /> <br />I'm not going to spend the, we're talking millions of dollars here, the money and the time to refurbish that, because to me, it doesn't really exist anymore. It's like this is the movie I wanted it to be, and I'm sorry you saw half a completed film and fell in love with it. But I want it to be the way I want it to be. <br /> <br /> <br />Question: Why did you change your mind and decide to put the original three movies out on DVD now? <br /> <br />GEORGE LUCAS: Just because the market has shifted so dramatically. A lot of people are getting very worried about piracy. That has really eaten dramatically into the sales. It really just came down to, there may not be a market when I wanted to bring it out, which was like, three years from now. So rather than just sit by and watch the whole thing fall apart, better to bring it out early and get it over with. <br /> <br /> <br />Question: Do you pay much attention to fan reactions to your choices? <br /> <br />LUCAS: Not really. The movies are what the movies are. ... The thing about science-fiction fans and \\"Star Wars\\" fans is they're very independent-thinking people. They all think outside the box, but they all have very strong ideas about what should happen, and they think it should be their way. Which is fine, except I'm making the movies, so I should have it my way. <br />__________________________________________ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />that's enough... <br />(if you want to read the whole interview and make suffer to your stomach go to the link: <br />edition.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/Movies/09/20/film.qa.george.lucas.ap/index.html <br />) <br />you are adviced! why lucas why... <br /> <br />so what we have to do now is just rent it or buy a p'rate copy (the package is even cheap,why did they not copy the design package of the LOTR extended edition?) When you watch the series, and when those changes comes, cover your eyes and go on! <br /> <br />the only good thing is that the canges is only 5% of the whole trilogy, so 95% is the original version so it's worth to watch it. <br /> <br />star wars series were a good mopvie and one of the best trilogy of all time, but those changes lucas made, and watching the prequels, the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy is far, far away the best trilogy of all time... <br />and return of the king the best picture of all time, only behind the God Father part 1... <br /> <br />Thanks GEORGE LUCAS for spoiled one of the most exciting experience i ever lived, and Gollumn really kicked lucas a..ss for that st'pid jar jar binks..........
B0002OERI0|5.0|This is Green Day's Sgt Pepper.  This is a raw genius talent becoming a super band and growing into their own. They show no fear in bringing the \\"new reality\\" to the front stage and mocking it.  It is almost certain to find dim-witted protests that question Patriotism like that of a McCarthy hearing. Those that oppose freedom of speech should go back to Bavaria. \\"When a true genius appears in the world, you may know him by this sign, that the dunces are all in confederacy against him.\\" -Jonathan Swift
0385336810|5.0|This book was absolutely fabulous. The character, Emma, is in some ways quite similar to Shopaholic Becky, in that they like to lie a lot. Other than that, Emma is such a funny person with the most unique personality. Well, not *that* unique - what I love most about Sophie Kinsella is that she seems to be writing about me! I did not personally relate to Emma in this book, but it was nonetheless an easy, breezy, HUMOROUS read! I hadn't finished a book in a day in a long time (not since &quot;Shopaholic Takes Manhattan&quot;) so this one definitely brought me back to bookwormhood. <br />I'm so glad Sophie Kinsella can write so well beyond the Shopaholic series (of which there is a new book!). I absolutely love her. She is officially my favorite author.<br />BUY THIS BOOK. It's been weeks, and still scenes from the story are replaying themselves in my mind. I think I might want to read it again!
0451169514|4.0|King's \\"It\\" suffers from Letdown Ending Syndrome, which has been known to mar other King works (think Dark Tower IV and Tommyknockers).  However, here it is at its most egregious. <br /> <br />LES is manifested when the ending of the book is an almost complete letdown when compared to the preceding buildup.  From the beginning until about the last 15 pages, \\"It\\" is a masterful work of horror fiction - creepy and haunting enough to make you look under your bed when you go to sleep at night.  Each character is fully fleshed out so that you can understand their emotions, motivations, and fears.  King brings you into the world these folks are experiencing and you're living in it... until he has to show you the bad guy.  The problem is that he's built it up too much.  How do you describe the most evil, noxious presence in creation?  What *does* it look like? <br /> <br />I'm not gonna spoil it for anyone who hasn't read \\"It\\" yet (King'll do that himself), but to you I say, read and enjoy this book and pretend that the climax was inserted by the editor without the author's knowledge.
B000001FS3|5.0|Over time I forgot how utterly amazing this album is, I pulled this album out of the cd rack a few days ago, and I'm now listening to it constantly, along with Achtung Baby, if you're a fan of rock, and haven't yet heard this album, get it!
B000001EHS|5.0|Def Leopard is an old band that not many people my age have heard of. Growing up with a father who loved music, rock and roll to be exact, I grew to love it as well. I have been listening to Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, REO Speedwagon, Billy Joel, and almost every rock and roll band around since I was about two years old and could actually get up and dance to it. My love for it has grown, even when my love for many other kinds of music has as well.   <br />Many people ask me what Def Leopard means, or where the band got their name in the first place. The band actually started out calling themselves Atomic Mass. Then member Joe Elliott decided that Deaf Leopard sounded better, which later on in the year they changed the spelling so it would look like Def Leopard.  <br />Def Leopard was actually thought of as the new wave of British Metal. They were a big hit right away in America. It was a mix of rock in roll, British Metal, and sort of a pop rock sound. No matter what they did, or what they sounded like, their audience followed them everywhere they went.  <br />The band started out in 1977 with their first album, and has had many since. The band members have changed throughout the entire time the band started. The lead vocal is Joe Elliott, Pete Wills was a guitar player from 1977-1982, and Phil Collen took his spot in 1982 and has been there since. Steve Clark was another guitarist from 1977 - 1991, and Vivian Campbell took over for him in 1992. The bass included Rick \\"Sav\\" Savage, who as well as Joe, has been in the band the entire time. Drums would be Tony Kenning from 1977 - 1978, Frank Noon in 1978, and then Rick Allen took over and has been the drum player for Def Leopard since 1978 on.  <br />Def Leopard really shot through the roof during the late 70's early 80's, and has been big ever since. Some of their biggest albums include, Hysteria which came out in August 3, 1987. Their other big album is Pyromania, and it was released on October 31, 1990.  <br/>In October of 1995 they came out with a CD called Vault. Vault covered all of their music from 1977 when they started until 1995. They have their greatest hits on the CD Vault, such as \\"Bringing on the Heartbreak,\\" \\"Pour Some Sugar on Me,\\" and \\"Two Steps Behind.\\"   <br /> When I started listening to Def Leopard I was about thirteen years old. I have kept a love for them ever since. Their best hits CD, Vault, covered every song that I had loved of theirs over the years. Def Leopard started to enter sort of a Pop Rock by the end of the 80's, but never lost their fans. They were part of the \\"Hairspray Band's\\" throughout the 80's and are still considered the same today, but they never lost their sound or beat for their music.  <br /> Def Leopard has so many catchy and sassy songs that no one during the 70's or 80's could resist them. Even though they seemed to be older during the 90's, everyone still loved them. Def Leopards status as one of the greatest rock and roll bands would never change, not even today.  <br /> The CD Vault has been one of my favorite CD's of all time. It is not everyday that I find a CD where I like every song on it. I do not just like them, but have fallen in love with them. I would give it five stars, no doubt about it! <br />
B000002JSR|5.0|What critics believe really has nothing to do with what die-hard fans should know.  Critics are paid to follow a quota---thumbs up to Bad albums and thumbs down to good ones. <br /> <br />I for one prefer to let my ears do the judging, and every time i listen to CODA, I am taken to a place where Music is GOD!! <br /> <br />Led Zeppelin released a masterpiece as usual when CODA was released.  Poor Tom..My favorite song showcases Jimmy's Talent with his guitar, and John's intro is a masterpiece.  I would have preferred Robert's screeching on Poor Tom, however this song shows he does have various vocal ranges, and can master lower octaves. <br /> <br />Bonzo's Montreux....\\"Nuff Said.  Let anyone say they're an amazing drummer, and ask them to listen to this track....they'll quit drumming..no one compares to BONZO. <br /> <br />All in all, a fantastic masterpiece--not unlike all Led Zeppelin's Albums.
B0002OERI0|4.0|I grew up listening to Green Day, and I'm happy to have a more mature album from them!  This album captures the essence of the original Green Day album, but also shows growth in a respectable way.  They are singing about more important things, and rightly so.  Growing older causes you to change focus from yourself onto the world, and they have displayed this perfectly in \\"American Idiot\\".<br /><br />I love the actual production of it. I love how the songs blend together.  This is going to be one of my favorite albums of the year.  Not since RAGE have I supported any musical political references, but this one comes just in time.<br /><br />It's very disheartening to see so much negativity around the lyrics to \\"American Idiot\\".  He's not saying Americans are idiots, he's saying he doesn't want to be one.  I don't want to be an American Idiot either, which is why I vote and educate myself about the world!  This isn't a negative song about all Americans, it's asking you to get up and do something about the state of the country.<br /><br />Just as people bashed Marilyn Manson without seeing the irony in his words, they're bashing \\"American Idiot\\".  That's exactly what it's about.  READ and LISTEN people!  Then you too, won't be an idiot.
B00030590I|3.0|\\"Hero\\" is absolutely one of most beautifully filmed movies of ANY genre...EVER.  For that reason alone it is worth seeing, whether you are a fan of martial arts movies or not.<br /><br />The use of colors as themes, indeed practically as supporting actors in their own right is absolutely awe-inspiring.  The movie becomes impressionist art brought to life, and a particularly dazzling life at that.  The action sequences are sublime (the highlight for me was perhaps too early in the movie when Jet Li and Donnie Yen squared off at the \\"chess\\" club during a rainstorm.  These are two professionals of unquestioned pedigree and ability that are always a joy to watch in any fight sequence; they have clearly outdone themselves in \\"Hero\\"), and the wirework -while admittedly not to everyone's taste- is likewise inspired.<br /><br />Comparisons to the Japanese classic \\"Rashomon\\" are justified, even though \\"Rashomon\\" is essentially multiple perceptions of the same act and \\"Hero\\", also told mainly in a series of flashbacks, is more similar to the ending of the home video version of \\"Clue\\" (most immediate example that comes to mind; obviously \\"Hero\\" is a far moe serious film than \\"Clue\\"!).<br /><br />My only problem is that the ending completely betrays the direction in which film was heading from the very beginning.  Without giving away the ending, it is simply not believable to me that someone who has dedicated so much of his life toward accomplishing a specific task would allow the certainty of his commitment to be questioned or even remotely compromised so easily.  I have noticed a rash of pacifism in mainstream martial arts films over the past few years (perhaps starting with Li Mu Bai's decision to hang up the Green Destiny sword in \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\" and running through Hanbei Mizoguchi's pleas for non-violence in \\"Samurai Fiction\\"), and frankly I find it rather unbecoming for the genre.  The title of \\"Hero\\" somewhat belies the decision of the protagonist, in my opinion.<br /><br />\\"Hero\\" shares some of the tragic Shakespearean elements of \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\"...and as a result both films are somewhat \\"deeper\\" in content than most martial arts movies, perhaps in an attempt to appeal beyond the typical cult audience and toward manistream moviegoers.  I'm not a class warrior or a movie snob enough to recoil in horror at the notion, but the soul of what makes these movies so enjoyable is somewhat compromised and that is somewhat disappointing if you have spent years watching the movies and developing your appreciation based on traditional martial arts film values.  Regardless of the action and effects and choreography that drop the jaw to the floor, the plot should have a resolution that is met with satisfaction within the viewer's soul.  And for THIS viewer, \\"Hero\\", though undeniably beautiful and almost certain to find a place on my shelf for its aesthetics alone, does not pass that test.  How unfortunate., in my opinion. <br /> <br />\\"Hero\\" shares some of the tragic Shakespearean elements of \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\"...and as a result both films are somewhat \\"deeper\\" in content than most martial arts movies, perhaps in an attempt to appeal beyond the typical cult audience and toward manistream moviegoers.

0446530891|3.0|I was disappointed with David Baldacci's \\"Split Second.\\" Unlike his previous works it is definitely not a strong, tightly written novel, although it could have been a real winner. Throughout much of the book, the thrills, adventure and mystery are certainly present and do keep the reader turning the pages. The three main characters are interesting, unusual and well developed. So, what's wrong? The second half of the novel falls apart. The pace slows; the tension diminishes; the characters begin to act out of character, and turn into cardboard figures without much rationale for their actions. The villain, who has such potential to be a really bad guy, is totally one-dimensional - pure evil incarnate with no complexity, more like a cartoon than a human being. There's a fascinating love triangle which should have taken-off - but falls flat. And after the terrific opening and much of the first half, the conclusion is weak. The book ends with a peep, not a bang!<br /><br />Sean King, Secret Service agent extraordinaire, with great career potential, is guarding a presidential candidate on a campaign stop in Smalltown USA. King's attention is diverted for one instant, and good cause, when the candidate, Clyde Ritter, is shot dead. Agent King recovers his composure immediately and shoots the assassin. The killer dies. So does King's career.<br /><br />Eight years later Secret Service agent and girl wonder Michelle Maxwell is on a career fast track in a profession where only men succeed. Agent Maxwell, a former Olympic rower, is the exception to the rule. She has her sights set on White House duty guarding the president and she just might get the gig. She is presently guarding a presidential candidate, John Bruno, who is making an unscheduled stop at a funeral home to pay his respects to the deceased. The room is vacated except for the candidate, the corpse and the widow. Bruno insists on time alone, without security. Uncomfortable with the candidate's decision, Maxwell, and fellow agents stand outside the closed door, 99% sure their charge will be safe. He is kidnapped right out from under their noses. Michelle may still have a job, but her career is over. She is determined, however, to find John Bruno before he is killed - if indeed, he is still alive.<br /><br />Former agent King is now living in a house he designed and built on a quiet lakefront in Virginia. He went back to school for a law degree and shares a practice in town. Sean reads of agent Maxwell's fall from grace and feels great empathy because of his similar experience. His empathy chills considerably when Ms. Maxwell shows up at his door with some questions and a theory that the murder and the kidnapping, eight years apart, just may be related. She provides some convincing arguments, and it doesn't hurt that King is wildly attracted to her, so he considers the ramifications of working with Michelle on the case.

B00005JMFQ|1.0|Yikes, what a bad movie. If you are expecting another flick on par with this director's own wonderfully hilarious, witty, and touching \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral,\\" think again. Saw this for free the week before it came out, and I still came out looking for a fight, even though I didn't spend any of my own money on it--it was that offensive to my not-so-delicate sensibilities. Imagine my surprise, then, when the thing became a well-received blockbuster. I'm no snob--I enjoy trash like \\"Big Trouble in Little China\\" and smart romantic comedies like \\"When Harry Met Sally\\" as much as any Kurosawa, Kubrick, or Greenaway flick (okay, I even like a lot of dumb romantic comedies, but don't tell). But this movie is manipulative, derivative crap. Its handful of good early moments eventually become baffling oddities in a sea of dreck; it's difficult to imagine how such imaginative people (director and actors alike) could ever approach the idiotic words they're saying, situations they're enacting, and emotions they're prostituting with any degree of seriousness. I mean, don't they go to the movies anymore? Don't they realize that this movie apes a hundred other better and even lesser flicks? That they're insulting us by asking us to feel genuine emotions for their idiotic characters and situations? If this were a straight comedy, I probably wouldn't feel so insulted; but no, this movie wants us to feeeel it, brothers and sisters! Let me sum it up: any movie that takes the potential comedic gold of a Prime Minister Hugh Grant vs. President Billy Bob Thorton matchup and attempts to turn it into, gasp, a serious dramatic situation doesn't deserve to be seen (by the way, I won't criticize the jingoism of this particular subplot; anti-Americanism is fine, as long as its funny and smart and more or less self-deprecating--fer instance, Monty Python were the most America-bashing limeys on the planet for a while there, but I and a million other fans laughed ourselves sick anyway).
B0002O06N0|5.0|I had heard a lot of buzz about these guys due to their new album coming out, so I figured... why not.  Most of the bands I've heard mentioned along with the White Stripes I haven't really liked very much (except for the Von Bondies and The Go, which are both heavily linked to mr. White himself). <br /> <br />The funny thing is, when I popped this cd in my car, I thought I was going to hate it.  The first track did absolutely nothing for me... luckily enough, turns out its one of only three tracks I don't really like (the other two being The Lengths and Act Nice and Gentle... they sound too much like country for my tastes). <br /> <br />Want something to compare this to?  My friend pointed out that a lot of songs sound like tracks from Are You Experienced... and he's actually pretty right.  This is blues/rock fusion in the mold of Hendrix's Hey Joe.  All Hands Against his Own and Girl is on my Mind are probably the best two examples.  Stellar guitar work that'll stick in your head all day, with some great blues-inspired vocals.  Wow.  These guys are really, really good... and their drummer can drum!  Wow, what a concept huh? <br /> <br />I can't recommend this album enough.  Just skip the first track.
B000003TAW|4.0|I liked this album alot. My favorite song on there was Surf Wax America. It was very catchy and had a good guitar sound. This one isn't the best one but it's still worth buying.
1400034779|4.0|What a delightful book this is!  This is an episodic novel that keeps moving forward.  The episodes build up to a beautiful character study.  The protagonist is one Mma Precious Ramotswe, a clever 35-year old Botswanan lady of ample proportions who has a big heart as well.  The book presents her story from the time of her father's wooing of her mother and a childhood of being raised by a kindly cousin who trained her mind after her mother's early death.  When Precious grows up, she marries an abusive man who abandons her when she is pregnant with a child who will only live five days.  But Mma Ramotswe manages to survive and prosper.  With the money her father bequeaths her she sets up The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency.  The book then documents her efforts to make her business a success and her breezy manner of solving mysteries.  She takes on several cases, from women who want to know if their husbands are cheating on them, a strict father who wants to know if his daughter has a boyfriend, a case of medical fraud and disappearance of a child whom she suspects was murdered in a witchcraft ritual.  This is all set before the stunning backdrop of Botswana, which is vividly evoked.  This is a beautiful book.  I don't remember the last time I read a novel as consistently charming and delightful.  I found it very difficult to put down and read it in record time for me.  I love Precious Ramotswe and look forward to her further adventures.

B00005JNEI|5.0|In literature, one's premises and view of US politics and history are quickly destabilized and reconstructed by Whiteout: The CIA, Drugs and the Press (Alexander Cockburn, and Jeffrey St. Clair) and Lies My Teacher Told me by Professor James Loewen. This is exactly what Michael Moore does with the tools of film and cinema. What was presented visually was common knowledge to those of us who choose to be inform and was consistent with The September 11 Commission's 567-page final report has confirmed key facts presented in Fahrenheit 9/11. These include; Attorney General John Ashcroft told acting FBI director Thomas Pickard that he did not want to hear anything more about terrorist threats. Confirmed, Commission Report at p. 265 After Bush was informed of the first plane hitting the World Trade Center, he went ahead with his classroom event. After Bush was informed that the nation was under attack after the second plane hit, Bush stayed in the classroom for nearly seven more minutes, continuing to read with the children. Confirmed, Commission Report at pp. 35, 38-39. Bush failed to have even one meeting to discuss the threat of terrorism with his head of counterterrorism Richard Clarke. Confirmed, Commission Report at p. 201. Bush failed to react to the August 6, 2001 security briefing, \\"Bin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S.\\" Confirmed, Commission Report at pp. 260-262. 142 Saudis, including 24 members of the bin Laden family, were allowed to leave the country after September 13. Confirmed, Commission Report at p. 556, n. 25 [Note that Fahrenheit 9/11 understates the number of Saudis who left.] Individuals were interviewed by the FBI before being allowed to leave (although the report confirms that most individuals on these flights were not interviewed.) Confirmed, Commission Report at p. 557, n. 28. White House former counterterrorism chief Richard Clarke approved these flights. Confirmed, Commission Report at p. 329. It should also be noted that the 9/11 Commission does not address or deem important a number of other issues either addressed in Fahrenheit 9/11 or revealed since completion of the film, including: What exactly was the rush in getting these individuals out of the country so soon after the worst attack in U.S. history, why did Saudi Royals and bin Laden family members receive such special treatment at a time when most Americans still could not get flights (even though airspace may have been open), and how exactly were the flights arranged by the U.S. government? Several unanswered questions posed by Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) in a July 20, 2004, Grand Forks Herald column: \\"At a time when 14 of the 19 terrorists from Sept. 11 were Saudi citizens, how and why were six secret flights allowed to sneak 142 Saudi citizens out of the United States in the days after Sept. 11 before they were properly interrogated? How do we know they weren't properly questioned? Because Dale Watson, the No. 2 man and former head of counterterrorism at the FBI has said none of them were subjected to `serious' interrogation or questions before being allowed to leave. In fact, we now know that at least two and perhaps more of the Saudis who were allowed to leave after Sept. 11 were under investigation by the FBI for alleged terrorist connections.\\" Information that came to light in Dana Milbank's July 22, 2004 Washington Post article, including the fact that at least one bin Laden family member who was allowed to leave lived with a nephew of Osama bin Laden, who \\"was involved in forming the U.S. branch of the World Assembly of Muslim Youth\\" (WAMY), which the FBI has described as \\"a suspected terrorist organization,\\" and that the bin Ladens flew out of the country on the same airplane that \\"has been chartered frequently by the White House for the press corps traveling with President Bush. The film is correct on all major facts presented. Opponents tend to argue on cosmetics and semantics rather than the documented facts. Very reminiscent of what happened to Gary Webb and \\"Dark Alliances\\".    (...)
B00005QGAT|5.0|Off the Wall Album Review <br />  From song like ABC to Heal the World, nobody can deny that Michael Jackson is not one of the most often played artists.  No matter what age, creed, color, nationality, race, religion.  You have at least heard one of Michael songs, like the Man In the Mirror, Thriller, and my all-time favorite Beat It.  Michael has been popular since the Jackson 5, practically being a house hold name.  Seeing him in many appearances especially with Michael Jordan in the song Jam.  Michael is the icon of being a superstar.  You can go to one of his concert in another country.  They know ever song that he has sung and every word.  They absolutely love and adore him; they do not care about the accusations placed before him.  Let's be realistic Michael made great music and will be rich for years to come, making money on the rights to all his songs that are still being played today.  Even though he is in the media with the whole child molestation, no one can deny that Michael will undoubtedly reign as the \\"King of Pop.\\" <br />Off the Wall album is Michael's first album as being solo.  He introduced this album in 1979.  It was a classic, and the genius that helped him produce the album was none other than Quincy Jones.  This classic record has some all-time songs like, Rock Wit You, Don't Stop Till You Get Enough, Working Day and Night, and especially Off the Wall.  This CD is by far the top three of Michael's albums.  This CD compared to the others is non-comparable by far.  This album released him into to the world as a solo artist and not only was that it a hit, every song was good.  It appealed to many people.  Michael Jackson was the \\"It\\" man.  I know that a lot of the new generation barely knows any of the songs that are on the album.  That's because when we were born Thriller, Beat It, and Bad were atop the charts.  Though hands down this one of the better or even the best overall Michael Jackson album. <br />Michael has so many albums with just himby himself, or back with Motown and his brothers.  It was hard to choose one because I have been a Michael Jackson fan since I can remember.  I can tell you that I used to watch the Jackson 5 cartoon when I was a little kid.  I remember when I first heard the song Beat It.  It was like magic my mother could not get me to stop singing it.  My dad had this little red wind breaker jacket, and when the song came on I had that jacket on my back doing the dances.  I would sit at home and watch the thriller tape so I could do all the moves with Michael on T.V.  I even had the game Moon Man on Nintendo which I begged my dad to let me get it.  I will and always will be a fanatic of the older, more younger Michael Jackson <br />
B0002UXBD6|5.0|I saw an interview some years ago with Green Day, they talked about themselves maturing as people and musicians.  They talked about Insomniac being their least favorite album...they made it after Dookie to prove to people they were punk and not sellouts to show up the old crowd that would heckle them on Gilman St.  They cancelled that tour halfway through because of a lack of believing in their own music. Billy Joe stated that they would only put out music that they believed in, no matter how long it takes in between albums.  I only wish other bands would take this very cavalier attitude. <br /> <br />As you may have read, American Idiot is an ambitious punk opera with a nod to the great and mostly forgotten rock operas of old.  It's been a long time since any band has put out an album of great songs that are so cohesive and so flowing that the entire album is so much greater than the sum of parts, this includes Green Day themselves. <br /> <br />I could list my fav. tracks, but only 6hrs. into the album, 4th listen through, it would not be fair. Nods go out to the power ballad Are We the Waiting, the first power ballad by a punk band I've ever heard.  Hats of to Jesus of Suburbia. <br /> <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor, if you are a fan of Green Day, don't hesitate, just buy it.  With over 300 albums in my personal collection, ranging from Screeching Weasel, to Springsteen, this is already in the top ten, for it's ambition, musicianship, lyrical content, and of course, originality.
B00006RINF|3.0|To be honest, I don't own this album, but I am in serious need of some good music, and I noticed that this CD was getting really good reviews. So I downlaoded a couple of songs that people said were really good. I was disappointed. It wasn't as 'heavenly' or even 'heavy' as people say. It sounded as though they were using the same guitar chords for the begining of every song. Perhaps my excuse isn't justiied because I haven't bought their CD (yet) but I wasn't blown away by what I heard.<BR>A last request...please stop comparing this band to Evanescence. I happen to be a fan of Evanescence, and I really hate misinformed people. Evanescence is not only a band that I would never have compared to Lacuna Coil (the only similarity being having female singers), but they actually came out the same time as Lacuna Coil did. They realeasd their first EP entitled Evanescence in 1998, which is th same year Lacuna Coil came out. Evanescence followed in 1999 with Sound Asleep/Whisper EP, and then in 2000 with Origin. They were signed after releasing Origin, and realeased their first actual album, Fallen, in 2003. Amy and Ben had been writing all these songs since 1993, when they met, and you'll find a)they never sounded like LacunaCoil and b)they never copied them. I would appreciate if no one else started calling Evanescence 'rip-offs' of Lacuna Coil, because they're not.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|I bought this cd based on a review here.  I can't believe how great it is!  I listen to it every day.  I played the entire cd over the sound system at work and my boss, co-workers, and even clients have asked about it and want to buy it.  The music is great, the lyrics are great - it's an all-around fantastic cd.  Gavin DeGraw is so talented.  You can really get into his music.  I'm impressed by the depth of the music, his voice, and the intelligent lyrics.  Definitely one of my all time favorite cds.  The second cd of live recordings just adds to the appeal.  It gives a whole fresh take to the music. Thank you, thank you Gavin.
B00023BLXK|5.0|I loved 'Dirty Dancing Havana Nights'! I've seen the original 'Dirty Dancing' a few times and this one is just as great! <br />The story is about a young high school girl(Katie) who moves with her family to Cuba in the late 1950's just before the revolution that put Castro in power(her father's job sends them there). She is bookish and shy.  <br />At the hotel where they are staying, she meets a young Cuban waiter with whom she strikes an immediate friendship. Javier(the waiter) is different from other young people she knows and he encourages her to come out of her shyness and be more free and open with herself.  <br />When her friend and sister see the two of them together, they alert the hotel staff and he immediately loses his job for being with her. Katie encourages Javier to enter a latin dance contest with her for the chance at some much needed cash that will be given to the winners. Javier happens to dance like a dream and Katie's family comes from a dance background as well. She feels that with enough practice together, they have a really good chance at winning. Naturally, during the course of practice and performing the two fall sweetly in love and awaken deep feelings in each other.   <br />Diego Luna and Romola Gerai star as the young couple and they are perfectly matched!  This was great casting! They have great chemistry and their dancing is fabulous!  Diego Luna is gorgeous! What a sexy smile!  <br />The music is incredible and watching 'Havana Nights' made me want to learn to dance! The soundtrack is definitely worth it! 'Dance Like This' is my favorite track, but I love all the songs! I could watch this one over and over! <br />This was a great production. The costumes, sets, location! All super! <br />'Dirty Dancing Havana Nights' is great. Definitely worth seeing more than once!
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|I have watched this movie more than a dozen times. Most of these people who have given bad reviews are due to their not liking Morgan Freeman's role. Well, this is a character actors' movie with the interaction between Freeman and Robbins. If these people cannot understand it, it is their problem. In my opinion, Freeman deserves an oscar for his role, it was fresh, original and beautifully done. Though Forrest Gump won a lot of the awards, it is my prediction that it will soon be forgotten. For instance, they have not announced relaunch of its DVDs, while there are 2 different versions of this movie that have been announced. You cannot watch that movie too many times, while this movie will soon become a classic (if it has not already become one, but that takes time). It is sad that people do not understand Morgan Freeman's breadth of acting. These people put it down to be the worst movie ever, it being boring etc, well that shows their lack of understanding of the movie. It is sad and their loss, as this is one of the greatest movies made. It was recently rated the greatest movie not to have won an oscar. If people wish to write an honest review, they should point out justified criticisms, instead of saying \\"There is not a honest moment in the movie\\". It is a travesty towards the others and most of us are intelligent, despite what these people think of us. Seeing the kind of movies and books that they like, it is obvious that they do not see eye to eye with the rest of us. Well, no one is asking them to watch the movie. My honest advice to the rest is please see the movie for yourself and make up your mind. This movie is rated #2 in the IMBD (Internet Movie DataBase), after \\"Godfather\\". No movie gets there by being silly, unintelligent or without good storyline, acting etc. It is a favorite for me, and I can proudly say that I know more about movies than these reviewers.
B00009YNGA|5.0|If you want to get a copy of Britney Spears' album, \\"Britney,\\" then this is DEFINITELY the one to get. This is the ONLY version of \\"Britney\\" that includes ALL 3 of the following bonus tracks: \\"Before The Goodbye,\\" \\"I Run Away,\\" and \\"When I Found You.\\" Plus, it still has the enhanced portion with the \\"Crossroads\\"-outtakes \\"Overprotected\\" video like on the original U.S. version. PLUS, I don't know if this version was possibly re-mastered, but to me the music sounds cleaner and fuller than on the original U.S. version. I even compared the two to make sure it wasn't my imagination. I definitely recommend buying this CD; and I also recommend accompanying it with the single of \\"I'm A Slave 4 U,\\" which includes the other bonus track from the \\"Britney\\" sessions, \\"Intimidated,\\" for the complete \\"Britney\\" experience.
B0002858YS|3.0|I was hesitant to pick up this album, and it turns out I had a right to be.  If you want solid music reflecting The Killers, you should go pick up Action Action.  However, this band did pull off a decent debut album with Hot Fuss.  The lyrics provide good storytelling, which is always entertaining, but unfortunately the vocals of Brandon Flowers resemble almost every other retro singer out there, so no surprise there.  The album-saving aspect of Hot Fuss is the creative use of synthesizer throughout, blending 80's music with a techno vibe that attracts many listeners.  I believe the retro phase definitely seems to be heading out the door; its turning into more of a fashion statement than a musical movement.  I'm convinced its on its last \\"death rattle\\", especially after reading some of the recent reviews from concerts featuring retro bands such as The Rapture and Interpol.  Unless the Killers can handle the stage without studio enhancement (which numerous retro bands haven't), they won't be around for longer than 1-2 years in the states.  Hopefully they can stay as popular in Europe as they have been. <br /> <br />Preferred Tracks: 1,2,7,9,10
068987474X|2.0|Men are simple, that much is true. But this book isn't correct. Let me tell you my own (short) story. I was a single guy, dating occasionally, enjoying the city. Couple of times I met women and began to get serious, only to get dumped/burned and hurt.  <br /> <br />Then I meet a great girl and this time I think \\"better slow right down, it it's to be, it'll be\\". I made the first call, but after a dinner or two, I got on with my life and waited for an occasion where we were with mutual friends again. I should stress that I wasn't playing games, just protecting my heart.  <br /> <br />Result? Five years of happy (with ups and downs) marriage later, two beautiful boys and a gorgeous wife I'd support in all she does and wants to be.  <br /> <br />Behrendt on the other hand, would have you believe that my not pursuing her like a dog on heat meant I wasn't interested. <br /> <br />The lesson? No idea. But I guess what's meant for you, won't pass by you.
B0002OERI0|3.0|This album is no Dookie.  However, Green Day WAS able to create a solid comeback album...and by comeback I mean that they haven't TRULY been Green Day since before Warning and even Nimrod.  The band has definitely evolved, filling this album with lyrics more meaningful than (...)losing it's fun\\".  The trio from Berkeley even comes off sounding politically driven in most tracks.  Unfortunately, their instruments haven't evolved with their lyrics.  In fact, the drums seemed to have slowed and simplified since previous records.  But if you're interested in hearing the good old Green Day sound everyone loved from the mid-90's, American Idiot is worth the buy.    Preferred Tracks: 1,2,4,7,9
B000002MUW|5.0|This is one of my favorite Madonna albums. It has a nice R&B vibe to it. I recommend for anyone who likes \\"Secret\\" or \\"Take A Bow\\" to get this album. The best tracks are Human Nature, Don't Stop, Secret, Take A Bow and  Forbidden Love.   1. Survival    4/5  This is a nice song. I like the background music. It's a nice song to start the album off with.  2. Secret      5/5  First single released off of the album. This song is amazing. It's the main reason why I bought the album. It's just a lovely ballad.   3. I'd Rather Be Your Lover  4/5  I like this song. It's fun to sing to.   4. Don't Stop    5/5  This was rumored to be the fourth single instead of the controversial \\"Human Nature.\\" Some radio stations even replaced \\"Human Nature\\" with this track. It's the only upbeat, pop song on the CD. It's very catchy. Love it.  5. Inside of Me    3/5  I'm kind of if-fy on this song. I like the chorus but the song kind of drags on. It's nice though.    6. Human Nature           5/5  Fourth and final single released off of the album. This is definitely my favorite song on the album. In this song, Madonna attacks the media for criticizing her for expressing herself and her previous album Erotica, as well as her book Sex.  7. Forbidden Love           5/5  This song is about a relatinoship that is seen as a taboo in society. It was planned to be the fifth and final single, but plans were scraped when Something to Remember was being pushed.   8. Love Tried to Welcome Me  ? 1/5  Skip this. Only song I don't like  9. Sanctuary    5/5  I used to skip this but I love the way she sings the chorus... \\"Who needs the sun?...\\" I love it now.   10. Bedtime Story    4/5  Third single released off of the album. This is a very different song. At first, I hated it. But i find myself singing it everyday... It's a nice but creepy song. Great interlude to the upcoming Ray of Light album.  11. Take A Bow    5/5  Second single released off of the album. This song as well as \\"Secret\\" were my favoriteMadonna songs before I bought any of her albums. It's an amazing song and a great way to end the album. It's a slow ballad with a lovely music video.    Unreleased songs...  *        Your Honesty                           5/5  I don't get why this song was not included in this album (I mean, it has only 11 songs!) It's an upbeat R&B song that was released to the public almost a decade after it was recorded - on the Remixed and Revisted EP in 2003.
B000002MT0|2.0|I am not sure which album the majority of these Prince fans have been listening to, but \\"Come\\" is spectacularly mediocre. <br />None of these songs compare favorably to either his 80's highlights, or even \\"Musicology\\", his most recent \\"comeback\\" disc. The grooves are OK, but overall the songs are so boring. 'Boring\\" is the one thing Prince NEVER should be, don't you think? They meander, the choruses are difficult to remember five minutes afterwards, the lyrics sound made up...\\"Come\\" and \\"Letitgo\\" are as close as he comes to anything that would make it to a Prince Best-Of compilation... <br />Even \\"Chaos and DIsorder\\" is a better album than this. <br />Yes, this album technically was a \\"contractual obligation.\\"  <br />It's not one you'll be turning to very often.
0140868445|5.0|Hearing this story again on tape was just wonderful.  The actor is very good.  I love books on tape, and this is among my top favorites ever.<br /><br />I loved Grapes of Wrath (read in my sophomore year).  It was a joy, and often hard, to rediscover this beautiful story about the determined and downtrodden Joads.  This actor does a great job in rendering the characters with sensitivity.<br /><br />My favorite part is when they cross into CA and Mrs. Joad makes her stand, saying \\"We're not bustin' up this family!\\"  This scene was just as moving on tape as it was when I first read it long ago.  It brought tears to my eyes all over again.  I highly recommend this audio book!
B00006879E|5.0|Maroon 5 Songs About Jane is one of the best cd's I've heard all of 2004.  I never really listened to rock I was more of an R&B and soul kinda guy which I still am, but lately I've been expanding my horizons and glad to say that I have, because you can't really say you love music without listening to all genres. Now with that said back to Songs About Jane, this album from track 1-12 is excellent.  Maroon 5 is very funky,soulful,rock,and beatles influenced. which if you want to be influenced by a group thats the one to be influenced by. <br />The lead singers vocals are dynamite this boy can really sing his approach on every song makes you feel the lyrics,not just listening to someone singing words. My favorite songs are \\"Sunday Morning\\",\\"She Will Be Loved\\",\\"shiver\\",and \\"Sweetest Goodbye. And I love every other track. This album is all about the trials and tribulations of love finding it,losing it,your wrongs,her wrongs, and finding each other again. A great C.D. from instrumentals,vocals,to clever writing.  I look foward to their next C.D., these guys are taking rock into the next stage of its evolution.
B00005JMYI|5.0|This comedy can be described as nothing less than orgasmic. It is in the variety of outrageous characters that this comedy thrives, soaring above all others. By portraying a sexist anchorman from the 70's, who mindlessly offends everyone, Will Ferrell reveals to the audience one of the funniest characters in recent history. Moreover, if one does not view the comedy in glorifying and rediculing something as rediculous as an achorman, they might want to stick with something a little easier to swallow, like suspense thriller genre (\\"Alien vs. Preator,\\" perhaps?).This comedy is anything but realistic,and sometimes it takes a more mature viewer to understand that. Personally, I believe that the movie is not 'trying to hard,' rather, it flows smoothly, like a beautiful comedic orchestra. Sometimes the viewers may be trying to hard, not the movie.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Sophia Coppola takes a minimalists, guerilla film approach to a bitter sweet story of two souls lost in their lives.  Set in Tokyo over the course of a week, the movie follows the lives of Bob Harris (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlet Johansson). Harris an actor is realizing that his hay day of movie making is behind him and he now has to live out his fame in reruns and commercials.  Charlotte, the wife of an up-and-coming photographer has come to Japan to hang out while her husband, played by Giovanni Ribisi, is away on photo shoots.  Both suffering from insomnia, Bob and Charlotte meet in the hotels bar and start a friendship that helps both of them find what they are missing in their lives.  Charlotte, in her early twenties has been married for two to three years and has a feeling that the passion is gone from her life.  Bob, well into his fifties I assume, knows the passion is gone from his life but is just thankful that the whiskey works. Bob and Charlotte spend their time getting into diverse situations all in an attempt to find or hide from their lives. Shot entirely on location in Tokyo, the backdrop of the Tokyo nightlife helps our couple fade from their perspective realities, but never too far.  Bob's estranged wife and children are kept in his life by his cell-phone (which is portrayed as the only link to the \\"sane\\", non Japanese world) where as Charlotte is with her husband and reminded every time she sees him why she feels that sense of misdirection in her life and also the reason why she wants to make it work.   <br /> The cinematography and Tokyo scenes are truly amazing, in a way that brings out the beauty of the city without looking like a tourist film or being clichd.  Ms. Coppola's use of beautifully organic country-sides and ancient Buddhist temples mix perfectly with the neon-industrial forms of the city. A strong Indie-soundtrack only makes this film more of an overall experience.  Backed by artists such as Bryan Ferry, Marvin Hamlisch, Brian Reitzell and various local Japanese musicians, the \\"Lost in Translation\\" soundtrack is as impressive as the movie and as indispensable as Bill Murray.  The story entertains the audience without playing to the uneducated; it allows the audience to think for themselves on the connection between Harris and Charlotte.  The relationship played out between Harris and Charlotte is never seedy or even romantically physical, but the end result is one that will help make their relationship stand along the line of Ingrid and Bogart.    The only part in the film I feel leaves the audience at bay is that we are supposed to sympathize and at times feel sorry for people that have money, fame and some influence and a means to cope with their problems. The nice thing about Coppola's direction is that even with all that the movie tells us, money can't buy everything, and that even truly successful people are just that, people.   <br />
B0002Y69NG|5.0|This, quite frankly, is the greatest and most visionary movie trilogy of all time, surpassing Star Wars itself. <br /> <br />And to add to that, the Wachowski (I forget how it's spelled, forgive me!) brothers have created an entire history, an entire universe, from scratch, and now they have this. <br /> <br />When I found out that they were releasing a box set, I loved the idea, but I had never imagined that it'd go this far. <br /> <br />Bravo, guys, bravo. you are true geniuses. I salute you for this brilliance.

B00003CY6M|5.0|Do you believe in love at first sight? This is the love story of Jonathan Trager (played by John Cusack) and Sara Thomas (played by Kate Beckinsale). They met at a department store right around Christmas time when they both picked up the same pair of black, cashmere gloves. Somehow, they have an instant connection and end up going around to a series of places in New York together that night- from a coffee shop called \\"Serendipity\\" to an ice skating rink. They have a great chemistry between them, and when Jonathan tries to get Sara's number, a semi truck drives by and the paper with her number on it flies into the air. Sara believes in fate, so when the paper is lost, she sees that as a sign that fate is telling them to step back. The rest of the night is spent looking for clues to see if they are meant to be together and if fate does exist.  <br />          In the end, though, Jonathan writes his name and phone number on a five-dollar bill, and Sara writes her name and phone number on the inside of a book. If they find the other person's name and phone number, they are meant to be together. The rest of the movie is spent going through how similar their lives have been since they met, and a series of close encounters. When they are both just about to get married, they decide that in order to get on with their lives, they need to find their one-night love to see if they were really meant to be together. They go through extraordinary lengths in order to find who they thought would be their one true love.  <br />I don't know how many times I have seen this movie, but it is one that I could watch again and again. This story is so heartwarming and makes me wonder if there really is such a thing as fate, and if I'm destined to be with someone. It would be great to have a guy like Jonathan that is willing to do anything to find who he thinks might be his one true love. The first time I saw this in the theater, my friend and I talked about the movie for days. There were so many things that happened, but it all seems to go by too quickly. <br />This is a great movie, if you are into the chick-flick, somewhat predictable, yet incredibly romantic love story. It is fun to watch the clues unfold, but there are some points where you just want to yell out at the actors and tell them what to do so Jonathan and Sara will be back together again. Jonathan Trager and Sara Thomas have a great chemistry between them on camera. Jonathan always knows what to say, and that is enough to make any love-sick woman's heart melt and think \\"I need to find a guy like that.\\" I would recommend this movie to anyone that likes a good romantic comedy. Even though you can usually tell what will happen next, it is fun to see if you are right.  <br />
B000006OBQ|5.0|Sinatra at the Sands embodies what it must have been like to sit in the showroom of the Sands hotel and casino in the late fifties early sixties.  Frank on this album is like a glass of good scotch.  His voice, the whiskey, warm and powerful at the same time, reminiscent of the first sip his melodic tone sweeps over your body leaving a glow you can feel in your cheeks.  Punctuated with his humor and onstage banter, similar to good ice in a drink they serve to suspend the experience with just the right contrast of warm and cold.  Accompanying Frank in this drink is the big band styling of Count Basie and his Orchestra, like adding good mineral water to the drink, Count Basie only enhances the performance with what can not be described but only experienced.  A concert set sound system, like the BOSE, is not the only way to enjoy an album like this but to get the full effect; turn the lights down low, pour yourself a slow drink and relax in your favorite leather chair and close your eyes.  From the introduction by the stage manager of the Sands thru the escapism of \\"Come fly with me\\" to \\"I've got you under my skin' to the bluesy bistro sounds of \\"One more for the road\\" to Franks final refusal to play just one more encore, Sinatra at the Sands is truly the closest thing to a time machine we have today.
B00001MXXH|5.0|Everyone has had one of those days where it is so nice outside, they don't want to waste the day. The same is true for a high school student named Ferris Bueller. He goes through extraordinary lengths to miss a day by faking sick. Ferris is smarter than the average kid when it comes to faking sick- he has a plan. He lists exactly what you need to do in order to successfully fake sick, without scaring your parents and making them take you to the doctor, from having clammy hands to stomach pains. His parents believe his story, but his sister doesn't buy it for a minute. The whole family eventually leaves Ferris at home by himself, while they go to school and work. This leaves him to enjoy his day. <br /> Ferris calls his best friend Cameron and tells him to come over so they can go do something, but the friend says he is really sick. Eventually, though, Ferris convinces Cameron to pick him up. The next problem is getting their friend Sloane to get out of school, too. They devise a plan to tell the school that Sloane's grandmother has just died and that her father, who is really played by Cameron, will pick her up from school. At first the principal doesn't believe the story at all, because he found it strange that the three friends would miss school on the same day, and assumed it was Ferris calling her out. Ferris, being the smart kid he is, decided to call into the school and ask for his homework to be sent home with his sister. The principal apologizes for not believing Sloane's father, and makes sure she leaves school safely. For the rest of the day the three go around town, making the most of their day off of school, but run into several mishaps along the way. <br /> The only thing that bothered me in the movie was that the actors seemed to be too old for their roles, but that tends to be like that in most movies and television shows. Even still, these actors did a phenomenal job in their roles. They acted like real friends, which helps the audience get into thestory better. Their friendship is a typical high school friendship, where there are two friends that go out, and the third friend kind of tags along with them out of habit.  <br /> This is an excellent movie, and I would recommend it to anyone who has ever been in school, because they know the feeling of not wanting to be in class on a nice day. This movie is also really typical of high school friendships and getting into trouble. It seems that many high school friends that hang out a lot get into trouble together. These three friends have totally different personalities, which makes it easy for everyone to relate to at least one of them. Ferris is a goof-off who gets into trouble a lot. Cameron is a shy, more reserved character who is scared to get into trouble. Sloane is the flirty, younger girl who goes for the older guys. <br />
0590353403|5.0|It was two years ago when i first heard about Harry Potter. Now I am a true fan of all wizards and witches alike (with the exception of a few you know who they are). When I first began reading these books it was just to read; now it's more of a hobby I have read all five books that have been released and am in the process of buying them. I have also seen the first three movies and find them just as good as the books and everything is exactly how i pictured it. I would recommend this book and the others that have been published so far to anyone.
B00000IL1K|5.0|I have many CD's of Sarah, maybe I miss an old one, but this CD is definitely the best for me. The atmosphere created in this recording is worth closed curtains, candlelight and incense. Let the magnificent start of the CD get into your head, relax and enjoy. Sarah's voice is best in the more classical numbers, especially Nella Fantasia, Tu and Nessun Dorma. That doesn't make songs like Eden, Only an ocean away and Deliver me less interesting or beautiful. On the contrary, all songs are of very high quality, beautiful and well brought. Only Dust in the wind could be left out, although probably many people will not agree, but I think that the original by Kansas just cannot be beaten.

B00000DHRX|5.0|When my cousin handed me the Ladies and Gentlemen Album,i thought it was just a \\"somethingy\\" but after i've heard it ,its like my body has its conciousness to move in frenzy.I instantly love it especially \\"Outside,Fastlove\\" and others.It made me appreciate and enjoy his songs.I believe George Michael is really a superb musician in his own right.One thing,though,that is a big no-no for me and that is the lyrics which has a double meanings.Its not good for younger ones,definitely!
B000002UAF|5.0|The Beatles were by 1964,so world-renowned that they'd become movie stars. Almost everything the Beatles were doing was breaking entertainment records. That applied to the late great Elvis Presley until the Beatles came along. All the Beatles did in the film was \\"act naturally\\". John Lennon admitted in an interview that he,nor his three fellow Beatles,couldn't act. The soundtrack album was released in America with a different track listing on the United Artists label. Some of the songs on this album appeared on the Capitol Records' US release SOMETHING NEW. It wouldn't be long before the Beatles would do their next film,HELP!
B00006AW2G|5.0|Own this if you're reading this review. <br /> <br />One often hears it said (even among the reviews here) that Greatest Hits really are; the rest is filler and not needed unless one is a completefreak. I do not subscribe; quite the opposite in fact. But let me not judge. Be my guest.  <br /> <br />If one wishes to actually test this theorem, here's my suggestion: buy the Stones' \\"Hot Rocks\\" and \\"More Hot Rocks,\\" in my opinion the two best best-of collections ever -- and among the few in which the band's actual best work is actually represented well -- and then buy this record.  <br /> <br />\\"Let It Bleed\\" (and what are so often -- with good reason -- considered its companion works: \\"Beggars Banquet,\\" \\"Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out,\\" \\"Sticky Fingers\\" and \\"Exile on Main Street\\") date from a time you can't imagine if you cut your rock'n'roll teeth on such as Guns'N'Roses and Pearl Jam, Green Day and Nirvana and Korn: the period during which Mick Jagger and Keith Richard(s) were, with no serious competition, the coolest humans on the planet, and possibly the coolest ever. (Yes. Hard to imagine now.) There is not a recorded word spoken by either during the period 1968-1972 that won't clue you in on the key to the stiletto-sharp lyrics that populate the above albums. And \\"Let It Bleed,\\" although it isn't frequently considered the best of the set, hits the Stones at the peak of their form as interpreters of style. It's been said by better than me that the Stones' earliest work is essential to any basic understanding of rock'n'roll. This period indeed captures their revolutionary hard-wiring of blues guitar riffs into something else entirely (to paraphrase the Rough Guide).  <br /> <br />But to hear the Stones' -- and just about anybody British's -- best interpretations of American idiom, OK, possibly other than \\"High and Dry,\\" \\"Not Fade Away,\\" and \\"Mona I Need You Baby,\\" one needs to blow by the earliest records and the hits collections, go straight to that place I call Middle Stones, and sample \\"Love In Vain\\" and \\"Country Honk\\" from this record. Robert Johnson may have lived the blues better than \\"Love,\\" but he never played or sang them better. And \\"Country Honk\\" was, with \\"Dear Doctor\\" and \\"Factory Girl\\" from \\"Beggars Banquet,\\" a rollicking foretaste of the Gram-Parsons fed Stones Country that culminated in tracks 6 through 9 of \\"Exile,\\" perhaps the best side of country music ever recorded.  And while we're on American idiom, the Stones took the apocalyptic visions of the Doors and Jefferson Airplane and cranked them up an unforgettable several notches on \\"Gimme Shelter,\\" heard here, for the only time, the way it should be heard, as the first song on the record and a preview of coming attractions in America and the world at large. \\"Monkey Man\\" is as good as any guitar blaster in the canon, with the counterintuitive sweet'n'salty genius of a lilting Nicky Hopkins piano run to make it complete. \\"Midnight Rambler,\\" the most uncoverable rock classic ever, one even the Stones couldn't pull off after 1972, loses the live punch of the \\"Ya-Ya's\\" version but goes to the far right of the sinister scale. And \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\" is probably the only song Charlie Watts ever wishes he'd done the first studio take of (why couldn't they wait for him? Well, album producer Jimmy Miller can some kinda play drums is one reason).  <br /> <br />When I was fifteen, the Stones transfixed and scared me. Here, on one record, is why. <br /> <br />
B000002UAR|5.0|This album was released in America also but with only 11 tracks. The ones lacked are I'M ONLY SLEEPING,DOCTOR ROBERT and AND YOUR BIRD CAN SING. The aforementioned tracks appeared on the US release,YESTERDAY AND TODAY. Hits from this album appearing on THE BEATLES 1962-1966 are ELEANOR RIGBY and YELLOW SUBMARINE. The latter track would be re-used for the movie soundtrack album of the same name. I like George Harrison's I WANT TO TELL YOU. That songs would have nothing to do with football great O.J. Simpson's autobiography of the same title. Phil Collins covered TOMORROW NEVER KNOWS on his solo debut album. HERE,THERE AND EVERYWHERE was a minor hit. Alternate versions of some songs on this album would later appear on The Beatles' ANTHOLOGY 2,released in March 1996. The same version of ELEANOR RIGBY appeared on A2 but without Paul McCartney's lead vocal and John Lennon's and Harrison's little heard background. After the release of this album,the Beatles would embark on their very last tour. It was at this time that Lennon infuriated many fans at a concert by saying the Beatles were more popular than Jesus Christ. This led to a bonfire in Alabama where the infuriated fans placed all of their Beatles memorabilia into. All the other songs are good.
B00005ASHM|5.0|Okay, I do not need to go on about the merits of this classic album, many already have done so very well here.  But I do want to point out that several versions of this CD exist and one should shop carefully.   <br /> <br />This appears to be the stereo remaster which came out several years back, which in remastering some things were \\"left out\\" so to speak since some vocal tracks could not be properly isolated on the origonal tapes for inclusion in the new stereo version.   <br /> <br />On amazon the origonal mono does appear to be available as an import, but pricy of couse.  <br /> <br />Now what people need to look for is Capitol did release a version of pet sounds in 2001 which is the one people should buy but for some reason is not listed on amazon that I can find.  It has tracks 1 through 13 in origonal mono, then the bonus track 14, then tracks 15 through 27 in the remastered stereo, you get both origonal mono and new stereo versions on a single CD for what I think is the same price as the stereo-only release(at most $2 more).  Certainly a good value and it allows you to have both versions to compare yourself and decide what you feel is best. <br /> <br />Now I suspect that if you purchase this version listed here from amazon you may well end up with the mono + stereo version as it might be all that capitol sells now and amazon simply does not have their info up to date for this item, but if not, look somewhere other then amazon and get the version I am speaking of, it is easy to find in any major record store.  Hopefully amazon will either update their product information(if that is indeed the problem) or start carrying the stereo + mono mix in addition to this stereo only version.
B000002UAC|5.0|This album was first released in late 1963 in the UK. Beatlemania had not yet begun in the USA. However,INTRODUCING THE BEATLES was released the same year in the USA but didn't gain too much attention until the following year when the Beatles came to America for the very first time. The songs on this album were released in America on Capitol Records' MEET THE BEATLES! and THE BEATLES SECOND ALBUM. The cover photo also was used for MTB. Hits include ALL MY LOVING and TILL THERE WAS YOU. The latter song is from the play \\"The Music Man\\". Also on this album is YOU REALLY GOT A HOLD ON ME,a hit for the R&B group The Miracles. That was written by Smokey Robinson who then led the group. Another R&B favorite is MONEY(THAT'S WHAT I WANT). I don't know the artist who first recorded it. All the other songs are good.
B00020HEG6|5.0|John Williams has created a very unique soundtrack for Azkaban.  The CD is a joy to listen to.  The familiar theme is there with some interesting new elements.  The Knight Bus is jazzy and fun.  Double Trouble with lyrics by Shakespeare is a sing-along natural.  Love the drums at the beginning of Buckbeak's Flight and the Renaissance instruments and overtones of Window to the Past always give me a lump in my throat. Mischief Managed is a reverse snapshot of each piece which brings the album to a satisfying conclusion.  Very enjoyable.
B000002UAX|5.0|In late 1968,the Beatles released their self-titled 2 LP set with a solid white cover. That's why it's commonly known as \\"the White Album\\". My late uncle had an LP copy of this album that he got for Christmas many years ago. It was one of the original pressings with the Apple label(the granny smith apple is seen whole on sides 1 and 3 and is halved on sides 2 and 4). BACK IN THE U.S.S.R.,WHILE MY GUITAR GENTLY WEEPS and OB-LA-DI-OB-LA-DA later appeared on THE BEATLES 1967-1970,originally released in 1973 and reissued 20 years later on CD.THE CONTINUING STORY OF BUNGALOW BILL features John Lennon's then-girlfriend Yoko Ono. She only sings only one line in a disguised voice. BIRTHDAY was a minor hit. HELTER SKELTER was later recorded live by U2 for their 1988 RATTLE AND HUM album. Paul \\"Bono\\" Hewson quipped at the beginning,\\"It's a song Charles Manson stole from the Beatles. Now we're stealing it back!\\". This album,I must admit,contains some weirdness. It's in HS and REVOLUTION 9,which is all tidbits of meaningless talk and music. We hear \\"number nine\\" repeatedly on the track. REVOLUTION 1 is basically the same as REVOLUTION from THE BEATLES 1967-1970 and the US album HEY JUDE. The version on this album is slow and acoustic. George Harrison's SAVOY TRUFFLE has fans with sweet teeth craving such treats. Paul McCartney's ROCKY RACCOON is western-themed with an 1800's style piano. I WILL,a minor hit,later appeared on the 1977 US compilation LOVE SONGS. JULIA is an ode to Lennon's late mother who was killed by a drunk-driving off-duty cop. All the other songs are good,especially the closing track GOOD NIGHT,which Ringo Starr takes the lead.
0671027344|2.0|Unless you were a child prodigy who could read the Fountain Head and Naked Lunch in two to three days, play a part in the Rocky Horror Picture Show and discuss the meaning of life and death among other things at your teacher's house at the age of fourteen, then this will not be the book for you. This author is in wonderland if he expects any average person (and it doesn't even matter what click or scene you were in while in high school) to believe or relate to this story. The story at times became way too \\"cute\\" and kind of left the story shallow and unrealistic. Overall not a bad book and even some decent music references but if you are of a certain age and have somewhat of a grasp of reality, you probably won't buy into this book.
B000002UAO|5.0|This album was first released in late 1965 and only the title appeared on the cover. Isn't that weird? But \\"The Beatles\\" appeared on the spine with the title following it. Phychedelics began appearing on various items in 1965. \\"The Beatles\\" did appear on the back cover. Now for the songs: DRIVE MY CAR and NOWHERE MAN,not on the US version but on the US release,YESTERDAY AND TODAY were major hits appearing on THE BEATLES 1962-1966. The same applied to NORWEGIAN WOOD(THIS BIRD HAS FLOWN),GIRL,IN MY LIFE and MICHELLE. THINK FOR YOURSELF was written by George Harrison. All the other songs are good. Somebody sang IN MY LIFE at actor John Ritter's funeral in September 2003 at Ritter's request. Ritter was a die-hard Beatles fan.
0060574216|4.0|\\"Falling in love is always magical. It feels eternal, as if love will last forever. We naively believe that somehow we are exempt from the problems our parents had, free from the odds that love will die, assured that it is meant to be and that we are destined to live happily ever after.\\" Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus, is a book on how the opposite sex should approach different situations that could occur in a relationship early. Author John Gray realized that men and women are having problems expressing their needs to each other so he decided to write a book that would guide young couples to a loving and secure relationship. Unknowingly this book has affected a lot of relationships in the world today. Many people feel that this book has broken the code of silence between men and women everywhere. It has allowed them to expresses freely what they have been suppressing for far too long. Within this book John Gray discusses topics like \\"Mr. Fix-It and The Home Improvement Committee,\\" \\"Men go to their Cave and Women Talk,\\" and \\"How to Motivate the Opposite Sex.\\" All of these chapters give specifics on how to improve a relationship without hurting the other feelings.  <br />\\"We mistakenly assume that if our partners love us they will react and behave in a certain way, the ways we react and behave when we love someone.\\" This is a direct quote from Dr. Gray. Here I think that he is trying to show us that we can not change the way we are, as humans, even if the person we are trying to change is our partner. If you read the book thoroughly you will see that this book gives a lot of generalizations, but you should understand that this book was not written for a specific population, Dr. Gray was just trying to give some insight on relationships based on things that he personally experienced in his marriage and things he observed in different couples. While I was reading this book I noticed that even in my relationship I say things that may come across like I am uncaring, but after I got a thorough understanding of the true message in the text I realized that there are different methods of communication that I feel all couples should develop if they want to keep their relationships and marriage alive.  <br />Dr. Gray uses situations that could happen to every couple to display several points that he felt was important. I can just about guarantee you that almost every situation or argument given is this book will relate to you as a reader on a more personal level. You will begin to see that some of the things you were arguing about were so petty that the whole thing can be very sickening. I am not going to say that everything you read in this book is going to apply to every situation you experience in life; however the bottom line is that you realize that there are certain situations that can occur in relationships that can be easily avoided. As a person who has read the book, I can honestly say that if you follow some of the suggestions that Dr. Gray gives you will experience some positive feed back from your partner. This could either work for the best or it could also work for the worse, however you will never know if you don't give the suggestions a chance. This book forces you to be open-minded and considerate of the other person's feelings and circumstances.  <br />
B000002UB3|5.0|This album was entitled after an England studio that the Beatles often recorded at. This was the very last recorded Beatles album. On the cover we see all four Beatles crossing Abbey Road. Now for the songs:COME TOGETHER was a major hit and would be later covered by Aerosmith and Michael Jackson. Aerosmith's cover appeared in the 1978 Universal film SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND starring The Bee Gees and Peter Frampton. Jackson's cover appeared on his 1995 HISTORY album. SOMETHING,a love ballad composed by the late George Harrison. MAXWELL'S SILVER HAMMER is somewhat silly. That song is performed by Steve Martin in the SGT. PEPPER movie. OH! DARLING is another love ballad,this one written by Paul McCartney and sung by Robin Gibb in SGT. PEPPER. OCTOPUS'S GARDEN,written and performed by Richard \\"Ringo Starr\\" Starkey,would become popular amongst young children. I WANT YOU(She's So Heavy) also was part of the SGT. PEPPER soundtrack. HERE COMES THE SUN was another major hit penned by Harrison and covered by several artists. Also heard in SGT. PEPPER and on the soundtrack album are BECAUSE,YOU NEVER GIVE ME YOUR MONEY,MEAN MR. MUSTARD,SHE CAME IN THROUGH THE BATHROOM WINDOW,POLYTHENE PAM,GOLDEN SLUMBERS and CARRY THAT WEIGHT. All the other songs are great. The Beatles' ANTHOLOGY 3,released in October 1996,features alternative previously unreleased versions of some of these songs.
B00005OAIE|5.0|The young and upcoming musician John Mayer,released his debut album,Room for Squares. This talented singer/ songwriter was born on October 16th, and grew up in Connecticut. John picked up the guitar at the age of thirteen, and two years later was playing at local shows in his home town.  He later moved to New York to seek out new opportunities where he now lives, in Manhattan. John Mayer has said to have honest lyrics and a unique style of music, which has been categorized as pop rock or folk. Since his debut, his music and unique lyrics have been recently compared and linked to the famous Dave Matthews. While his debut album is all about self discovery and expression it is sure to impress and intrigue you into his life and hopefully love it just as much as I do.    <br />  <br />  John Mayer has a very unique lyrical style. His words tell you stories of his past, and his struggles through adolescence. For instance in the song \\"No Such Thing\\", he states \\"I want to run through the halls of my high school. I want to scream at the top of my lungs. I just found out there's no such thing as the real world, just a lie you've got to rise above.\\" In this song he is telling the story of his high school years and how he was not the most popular kid in school, hence the title of the album, \\"room for squares\\". This is why I love the CD so much. You can listen to his songs and visualize what he is saying. He is not trying to fool any one about what he has gone through in his life; they are honest and original lyrics. Even with a little sex appeal like in the most widely heard song \\"Your Body is a Wonderland\\", which has earned him a Grammy. He is able to write about his deep feelings and emotions in such a poetic manner. His lyrics and stories are the main reason why I love this album so much. Everything that he sings has a deeper meaning and can touch each individual differently and that is why his fans admire him greatly. This album is very personal and simply amazing.  <br /> <br />  His style of music has been reviewed as pop/rock or folk. His astonishing guitar playing put together with his amazing band puts a unique spin on all of his songs in this album. Even his boundless energy in his acoustic versions put others to shame, while his vocals are also one of a kind. His smooth and calming voice on most of the tracks makes the lyrics come to life. His sound is very unique and different from anyone else I have heard and has an audience range from teenage girls to adults who grew up listening to Fleetwood Mac and the Eagles. His songs can narrate the experiences that people are going through, or have been there before, making it easier to connect with, whether it being a broken heart or a \\"stupid mouth\\", John Mayer definitely has a way with his words.  <br />Some have compared his musical styling's to that of the well known guitarist Dave Matthews. While they both are amazing musicians, with astonishing guitar talent and beautiful lyrics, I do not think that there is much of a comparison. They have two different types of music and two different types of style. Dave Matthews is more towards the jazz and blues, while John Mayer is more pop rock and folk. John has more of an acoustic sound while Dave incorporates a saxophone in almost every one of his songs. I have had the opportunity to see both of them in concert, and there no comparison. Both are impressive musicians but each great in their own unique way.     <br />  <br />  All in all, the album \\"Room for Squares\\" is definitely a keeper. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a new voice, someone with honest lyrics and boundless energy. John is unique and quirky, sweet and a good time to listen to. You can relate to him and his songs and they will definitely put a smile on your face.   <br />
B000002UAU|5.0|In late 1966,after abandoning touring forever,The Beatles changed their facial appearances and recorded this album. Many radio stations play WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS immediately after the title track. I guess that's because the title track fades into WALHFMF. Richard \\"Ringo Starr\\" Starkey sings the lead vocal on the latter track. LUCY IN THE SKY WITH DIAMONDS,another hit,was inspired by a drawing composed by John Lennon's then-toddler son Julian. The track was later covered by Elton John. WITHIN YOU WITHOUT YOU was written by George Harrison. SHE'S LEAVING HOME was a minor hit and was recycled for the defunct LOVE SONGS compilation,released in America in 1977. In 1978,many of the songs on this album were re-used for the Universal film of the same title,starring The Bee Gees and Peter Frampton. FIXING A HOLE was sung by the late comedian George Burns in the film. Frampton performed GETTING BETTER. He would perform some other songs with and without the Bee Gees as well. Take note on this album how A DAY IN THE LIFE ends with four pianos striking the same chord(E major). On this album Lennon takes the lead vocal and Paul McCartney sings the bridge verse. In the film and on the soundtrack album,Barry Gibb takes the lead and his brother Robin sings the bridge verse. WHEN I'M SIXTY-FOUR was a minor hit also. Several months after this album was released,the Beatles' 32-year-old manager Brian Epstein fatally overdosed on drugs. The cover concept is beautiful and colorful. Great album!
B00003CY6M|4.0|Do you believe in fate?  How about destiny or the fact that everything happens for a reason, and there are no coincidences in life? In the romantic comedy Serendipity, it is a story of two New Yorkers, Jonathan Trager (John Cusack) and Sara Thomas (Kate Beckinsale) who meet by fate in a Bloomingdale's department store over a pair of black cashmere gloves, and spend an odd yet nice night together, then leave it all to chance as they write their phone numbers on a five dollar bill and a used book. If the bill or book is found then they know that they were meant to be and that fate has brought them together.  Years later, after neither have found each others phone numbers,  the two are close to getting married to different people, basically on the same date. While both are having second thoughts about their current situation and can't get the other off their minds, try one more time to find each other. This hopeful romantic film is a great date movie and highly recommended. If you don't believe in fate now, you will once you have watched this movie.  <br />  <br /> Serendipity means a fortunate accident. I personally think that everything happens for a reason and that there are no accidents or coincidences in life. So this movie was right up my ally. A little frustrating at first though to see a couple hit it off so well and then leave everything to chance, but if it was meant to be then it will happen, right? The two go through some pretty suspenseful twists and your left thinking if they're going to end up finding each other. The lengths that they both endure are so sweet you just want them to find each other and fall madly in love again.  <br />  <br />John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale have amazing on- screen chemistry, and when put together they make the perfect pair. John Cusack is a very witty guy in this film and is always there for a good laugh. His character, Jonathan Trager is your typical hopeless romantic that you end up rooting for in the end to find the girl and sweep her off her feet. He is a very talented actor and is nothing short of in this flick. His character is also paired with best friend Dean Kansky (Jeremy Piven), an obituary writer for the New York Times. Together these two are the dynamic duo. Jeremy Piven with his one-liners and comedic timing is a perfect side kick for the uneasy and confused Jonathan Trager. Both are in the race to find the girl of Jonathan's dream, running all around New York, pulled in a million directions, and fighting over obstacles in order to have one last chance with \\"the one\\" that got away, two days before his wedding. Opposite John Cusack, Kate Beckinsale is also an amazing actress to watch. She sparkles on screen with her beauty and grace, playing the perfect girl for Jonathan to chase. She too is linked with a best friend, Eve (Molly Shannon) who is by her side the whole time tearing through New York to try and find Jonathan. Molly Shannon's character owns a new-age store in San Francisco, and has just the quirky style and comedic support to balance out Kate Beckinsale. They are the perfect best bud match and are fun to watch interact with each other. With the wonderful setting of the beautiful New York and these four talented actors this movie was sure to attract all those hopeless romantics out there.  <br />  <br />Serendipity overall is a fantastic movie, with an interesting storyline, talented and well known actors all to a backdrop of the beautiful New York skyline. This is a great romantic comedy that will keep you in a pleasant suspense until the very end, and left wondering if there is a certain person out there that you are meant to spend the rest of your life with. Will you meet by fate, by chance; is it your long time best friend, or the person sitting next to you on the subway? This movie leaves you questioning your every move, and second guessing your life choices. Give fate and destiny a chance; you never know what they will bring to you. <br />

B000002LQD|5.0|I think you have to have hurt some, lost someone, suffered with someone dying, or had some sort of dramatic compromise in your life to really get into this album.  This album is just total cosmic blues, and it is stark.  If you haven't experienced a loss, you will not have some of the emotional triggers and tacit information that fills the songs in emotionally what they lack in orchestration.  Basically, pain is the orchestra in this CD.   <br /> <br />It is easy to be put off by this CD because in some spots it sounds like a precious garage band spoken word, and there are some weak spots in the album that make it an easy target from a critical standpoint (there are some ugly noodling guitar solos).  But from a feeling standpoint, the starkness of the album is soothing.  The instruments, chorusy guitars and fretless bass, create an ambience.  If you can relate to the feeling, you have some emotional information to plug into the soft spots, and it becomes a whole experience. <br /> <br />There is clarity and reckoning in the songs, and the weak spots to me signify just exactly how hard it is to capture the loss.  Lou Reed sometimes errs while daring to do something very hard, and that is far more valuable than succeding at something mundane and predictable (to loosely paraphrase Roosevelt.) The magic, although not consistent from song to song, is really there and amazing, trancendant, crystalline in some spots, and not in a highly stylized or cliched way that taps into your pop-music programming (you know, like in soundtracks that get really tense when you are supposed to be scared--music can be programmed to trick you into feeling a certain way).   <br /> <br />The album is really solid in the first half, especially Creamation, Magician, Power and Glory, and What's Good, and spottier toward the end IMO, especially Harry's Circumcision, Gassed and Stoked, and Power and Glory Part II. <br /> <br />
B0000DBJDM|3.0|I love this movie, because it shows the Floyd as a working band in a scenic location, even though it's dated, the overall influence of concert films has some roots in here (the focus on the band over audience)which you will see in \\"Last Waltz\\", \\"Big Time\\" and \\"Stop Making Sense\\".  <br /> <br />The fans of the post Syd-era \\"Saucerful\\" to \\"Meddle\\" will absolutely love this film. It's basically the video version of \\"Ummagumma's\\" live songs, with some \\"Meddle\\"(Echoes, One of These Days, Seamus aka Mademoiselle Nobs).  <br /> <br />In between the Pompeii footage, you see the band working on \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" (On the Run, Us and Them, Time, and Brain Damage/Eclipse) in the Abbey Road studios (which is also great for the Beatles fans), and chit-chatting in the commissary. The interviews are okay, not all that informative, although people will chuckle at Dave's comment about PF being a \\"drug band\\". I think that as far as it being in the film now that the \\"making of\\" has been released with most of that footage, I don't know if it should stay in...  <br /> <br />Wasn't impressed whatsoever with the \\"Director's Cut\\"...it didn't really add anything to it. It would also have been nice if one of PF took part in the commentary as well. Would rather have seen more ruins, or maybe some re-edits that would make the film look somewhat fresher and current.   <br /> <br />Considering that there's so little of Floyd on video, they really could have put some things on here. The 1 hour \\"Atom Heart\\" concert they shot for PBS in 1970, the \\"Brain Damage/Eclipse\\" promo, and a \\"Set the Controls\\" filmed around this time would have been really nice.  <br /> <br />But what is also sad when I watch this is that they didn't bother filming another live concert until \\"The Wall\\" which exists in bootlegs and has yet to be released as well as the post-Waters concert videos. What would be really great is if they did a video like Cure's \\"Trilogy\\", where they could do a full length concert of \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\", \\"Wish You Were Here\\" and \\"Animals\\" for posterity, which would be far more easier to pull off in 2004 than in 1977.  <br /> <br />
B00003CXCT|5.0|This review is basically to tell everyone who gave this DVD set a 1 star rating - to get a life.<br /><br />If you don't like the changes - then watch the VHS tapes that I know you own.  Give me a break!!!<br /><br />Consider this set on DVD to be the Director's Cut that Lucas has always wanted.  And also, consider that he has to relate these 3 to the new trilogy.  So the changes are necessary.<br /><br />If you're a true fan like I am - you have every version on VHS.  I have the original THX release box set from 1995, and I have the Huge box set of the Special Edition on VHS.  This edition on DVD is a much improved version of the Special Edition.<br /><br />And, if what I heard is true - the original versions of the Trilogy will be out on DVD in 2006.<br /><br />So, please - stop raggin' on George.  It's his vision - not yours.  Lock yourself back up in your closet and stay there.  Leave the reviews to the true fans.<br /><br />Thank you very much George Lucas - for the best set of movies on DVD I've ever owned!!
B0002UXBD6|5.0|Just when you thought Green Day couldn't get any better, they release American Idiot, their first full length album in four years. From its blistering title track to the heartwrenching Wake Me Up When September Ends, this album has it all; from fast paced punk to gripping power ballads, each song is new and exciting. The concept record, complete with two 9 minute plus mini-operas, follows the life of Jesus of Suburbia, a character disenfranchised from his family and environment, confused and alienated by his government, trying to make it on his own. How does it all turn out? American Idiot is a masterpiece that cannot be ignored. Don't be an idiot and pass this one by.
B000002L9B|5.0|Prince (my favourite consistant artist of all time) is at his best with this LP.  PARADE is the soundtrack to this underrated movie UNDER THE CHERRY MOON (which was one of Prince's best movies in my opinion).   <br /> <br />This LP has classic all over it... Thanks to one of my favourtie songs of all time 'sometimes it snows in april'.  I  love that song... and it is true that it does snow in april (i witnessed it!!)  <br /> <br />Other bangers on this LP is of course 'kiss', 'mountians', 'girls & boys', and 'christopher's parade'...There aere plenty of songs to get you worked up and loving Prince even more... <br /> <br />Prince did his thang in the 80s and he is coming back in the millenium with MUSICOLOGY... Prince will not disappoint you with PARADE (like prince ever dissapointed anyone... right&#62;?)
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|Troy is an entertaining big budget summer action movie.  It's got the big action sequences and big stars.  I never read the Iliad or any other greek stories but as a movie in itself I'd say it is good.  The thing I liked most about the movie was Eric Bana as Hector.  His performance was excellent even though he had to work with a pretty awful script.  Also, Brian Cox as Agamennon is worth watching too.  Overall, it was a good summer movie.  Worth owning on DVD.
B000002KMV|5.0|This album is brilliant.... Period...  <br /> <br />This LP was the very first perchase of my life ( by the way i was like 5 years old when i bought this ingenius piece of work)... <br /> <br />Argubally the wierdest track, which is also my fav is \\"jack u off\\"... I love this song and i dont even know why...  <br /> <br />Other classics \\"do me baby\\", \\"controversy\\" & \\"sexuality\\"... <br /> <br />Prince is the greatest musician of my time, your time, your mums time, even your grandmother (he has been around since like the 60s!!!!!!!!!! J/P)  Prince will always be my favourite male artist....
B000002NIW|5.0|It took me TWO hours to find out what song was being played in the movie, Manic, during the mosh pit scene.  <br />It originally was Rage Against the Machine's Freedom for the Sundance Festivel until some legal issues.  <br />BUT NONETHELESS Headup was THE SONG IN THE MOVIE MANIC!
B00005JMAH|5.0|The first two movies were pretty good, visually stunning, and they followed the books to a tee. But in a way the latter is a problem, after watching it you don't really feel like reading the books again. And while Chris Columbus did an okay job with the film, he's not a film maker, he's a blockbuster maker.<br /><br />Enter Alfonso Cuaron, a true filmmaker. Of course people are going to have a bit of trouble with it considering that Hogwarts looks different, the school grounds look different, and Cuaron took a few liberties with the plot. Of course, as his own artist, he really is supposed to do that isn't he? He has to artistically represent the book the way he sees it, which in my opinion is closer to the way JK Rowling intended it. (Especially considering the fact that she said that this movie is her favorite of the movies.)<br /><br />Not to mention that the kids are such good actors now. In the first two films Columbus hid their mistakes by trying not to keep the camera on them too much, rather than actually teaching them. Cuaron decided to have each character write an essay on their character, he taught them how to respond to situations when in character, and had them watching movies that will help them develop their acting skills. All the teaching definitely shows in this movie.<br /><br />The cinematography is a lot better, as well as the interlude scenes, like seeing the Whomping Willow (which is quite a bit different in this movie from COS) beat a bird in thin air, or seeing an umberella floating away in the storm at the Quidditch Match. The effects are brilliant, and you can definitely feel the characters as they move into their teens. And the Dementors and Buckbeak were excellent and very well done.<br /><br />Anyone can find something wrong with this film if they choose to look at it the wrong way. Don't look at this movie as an extension of the book, or you'll be disappointed, just look at it as it's own entity. It's a great movie on it's own, but doesn't completely match it's prequels except in characters and actors, and kind of moves around some of the things in the book as well as adding in it's own things. I would say go and see the movie, just don't think too much about it. I'll definitely be buying this the day it hits the shelves.but doesn't completely match it's prequels except in characters and actors, and kind of moves around some of the things in the book as well as adding in it's own things.

B0002234LS|2.0|The acting was great, the music was great, but the story was very similar to \\"The Dark Half\\". I wasn't at all suprised by the so-called \\"surprise ending\\".
B00004LN16|4.0|I'm not going to lie, this isn't exactly AC/DC's best. BUT! If you have bought pretty much all of AC/DC's CDs and you are missing out on this one you should really consider buying it! It has some flaws but a lot of good points to. Meltdown was a good song. Stiff Upper Lip, the title track was pretty great!  <br /> <br />You should get this if you want a good album by AC/DC but if you're just starting your rock collection or your AC/DC collection you should get Highway to Hell or Back in Black first. While its not their best, its just as good if not better than some of their other stuff (and its much better than the music that playson theradio today)!
B0000AI45P|5.0|It seems incredible that almost 30 years have passed since Marquee Moon was first released to a largely indifferent public. But this passage of time merely underscores the fact that this album is, for want of a better term, timeless . I imagine in 50 years it will be every bit as fresh and inspiring as it was in 1977, and as it is in 2004 . Opinions are subjective, of course, but the opening riff of See No Evil still gives me chills as it did the very first time I heard it ... way back when . That's the beauty and mystery of this enigmatic music . Music that rocks ... and at the same time touches your soul with a poetry that most can only aspire to . The lyrics are wonderfully oblique, the guitar playing (and interplay) may seem pedestrian to the uninitiated (or to those who were weaned on the pyrotechnics of the 1980's) but Verlaine's laconic solos will stick to the inside of your skull and never leave . The word \\"autumnal\\" comes to mind when I think of Verlaine's guitar style . At times blistering, and then again, melancholic . You either get it, or you don't . <br />The current remake/remaster is fine . The sound is crisp and those Fenders never sounded better . The extra tracks are certainly nice to have, but in the end they're not nessesary. Why put arms on the Venus de Milo when she's already perfect?
1591840562|5.0|I loved it! Well written, easy, quick and entrepreneurial-focus. Guy Kawasaki's The Art of the Start is a great book about starting anything. The first chapters focus on the core values of entrepreneurship and their translations into actions. This issue is seldom being discussed and it is the hidden layer beneath business plans. Chapter after chapter a network of great ideas are being discovered by the reader and great tips and ideas are provided to those who want to \\"create a product or service that makes the world a better place\\". <br />Over and above the sheer joy of reading this book, Kawasaki is worth his weight in gold to entrepreneurs. Many of the ideas he is sharing with his readers would be incredibly useful to them. The book is full of tidbits and advice that seems to be a \\"must\\" for everyone.  <br />As a non-American entrepreneur I found it to be a multi-cultural book that will serve the readers outside the Silicon Valley but rather everywhere.  <br />Overall, this is an excellent book about how to build a company and hope that it will last. If someone is looking for a quick reference of strategies to start a company, this is probably THE book for them. <br />Ronit HaNegby, Ph.D. (Herzeliya, Israel) <br />
B00009W0U4|4.0|Gaspar Noe's \\"Irreversible\\" is undoubtedly one of the most intense films I've ever seen. It actually might be one of the most gut-churning films ever made. It's just unbelievable of what you're exposed to while watching this. \\"Irreversible\\" was a hit-or-miss in the theaters since many admired it and many dispised it. It was ranked the most walked out film (There were about 1,000 walk-outs) at Sundance. Yes, it's that bad. When I first heard about all the controversy and complaints about how violent \\"Irreversible\\" was, I sad to myself; \\"How bad could it possibly be?\\" But the hype was indeed correct. It's *that* bad.  <br /> <br />With a reversed-told story somewhat reminisce of Christopher Nolan's brilliant and complex \\"Memento,\\" it's a no-holds-barred revenge story about 2 friends, Marcus (Vincent Cassel) and Pierre, who are in search of tracking down the man responsible for the rape and beating of Marcus's girlfriend, Alex (Monica Bellucci, Cassel's real-life spouse). It involves a long scene with the two in search of the rapist in a gay S&M club named The Rectum, with the dizzying hand-held camera movements and music.  The music made me sick. It's so hard to describle why but you would notice if you were watching the film. It was a bit controversial since critics labeled it as homophobic since it quickly shows numerous men blowing one another and screaming, \\"Fist me! or \\"Suck me! <br /> <br />The rape scene was frightening. It was shown for 9 minutes with no cuts at all. It's all one big long scene. She's sodomised for several minutes with La Tenia (the rapist) sweet-talking her in extremely vulgar and misogynistic comments, plus a very realistic beating to go along with it afterwards. He hammered her so bad that it left her comatose. But the scene that likely created the most walk-outs (Since the rape scene happened during the first hour) was another harrowing scene; the fire extinguisher beating, which occurs during the first 15 minutes of the film. Like the rape, the beating was shot in one single cut with the camera focusing on the victim's face being bashed (literally) so much to the point where there would be nothing left of his head. <br /> <br />I don't think there's many films more unpleasant than \\"Irreversible.\\" It's quite honest on the crime of rape and it packs a powerful punch, especially when you see the last scene at the very end (or the beginning). But it's only recommended for a selected amount of viewers; it's so violent and you never see acts this cruel in film.
0156027321|2.0|This novel gets off to a great start, with beautiful language and a main character who uniquely participates in three major religions and doesn't understand why different religions are viewed by most as mutually exclusive. <br /> <br />Then it lost me. Before long I found all the endless concrete survival details rather tedious ... Robinson Crusoe and Swiss Family Robinson are far better survival tales IMHO. And the twist at the end ... the bottom line is that neither storyline is credible, and my buy-in had been lost to the point that I no longer cared to expend any mental energy considering the question. <br /> <br />Since I was reading the book for my book group, I was forced to consider it anyway.  <br /> <br />I was left puzzled by all the raves I've heard about this book--and the fact that it won the Booker Prize. I was also quite puzzled--and so was everyone else in my book group, some of whom believe in God and some who don't--by the claim that this is a story to make you believe in God. All this story made me believe in is the fallibility of reviewers and the poor judgment of those who recommended it to me. <br /> <br />Your time and money would be better spent elsewhere, unless you're specifically interested in the religious aspect of the first part of the novel. Had this beginning been finished, I would probably be writing a very different review.
B00000F566|5.0|This movie is great because if deals with a guy seen as a loser sometimes (altough he is different and not a loser at all) that changes his ways because of a girl that loves him the way he is. <br /> <br />Often, people like the hero (played by Patrick Swayze) that are different and a bit unorthodox are viewed as rebels or not good, when for the huge majority of people like this, they can make society a better place: just by showing that being yourself and expressing who and what you are by an activity or art (like dance) makes happier people. <br /> <br />This movie is underlying strongly 3 things: <br /> <br />1) Be who you are and true to yourself <br />2) Yes, true love conquers all <br />3) Do not assume who someone is by their looks only <br /> <br />A must for people serching truth in their soul <br />
1577311523|1.0|You really think this book is true just because someone else says so? Because the author spent 10 years toiling after what made HIMSELF happy? All he did was rip off buddhism and slap a new title on it. This book is not the way to joy. This book is not the way to live a life of meaningful relationships, and it's certanly not the way to feel good about yourself. What is your purpose here on this planet? Why are you here? For yourself? What kind of life is that? Living for yourself. Thats not a way to live. Don't get me wrong I am not condeming you for buying this book. No. What I am doing is asking you your motives. Why you are buying this book, and if you are sure you want to go on living a life this book wants you to lead. I urge you, ask yourself, \\"Why do I do the things I do,\\" and more importantly, \\"who do I do them for?\\"
B000002W9Q|5.0|Well, I adore music, lived in 5 countries, speak 3 lingos and used to do choregraphy 5 times a week for about 9 years and...as much as I love French songs, Italian opera and Hispanic Rumba, Dirty Dancing is a classic of gold quality too: American romance, and a beat to listen that is great from training to dancing even for driving! <br /> <br />Take it for what it is: a true timeless gem...
B000002UJQ|5.0|This cd is truly breathtaking...I've had it for about 2 years now, and it has not faded or gotten old...it seems like whenever i listen to it...the songs just get more and more meaningful then before.  I cant even tell you what the best tracks are on this cd are...because every single one is great. My favorite song on here though would probably have to be \\"Climbing Up The Walls.\\" That song just...is beyond words. If you've never heard of Radiohead yet, i truly reccomend looking up their lyrics. Trust me...you will be very interested in their music after that. Subterranean Homesick Alien...Look Up to the lyrics to that song....incredible. Also, Radiohead tends to cast a dreamy, relaxed mood over you...that many bands could only dream of doing. This CD screams talent. Go buy it now...
B00005JMEW|2.0|If this is cliamed as Quentin Tarantino's best, then I'd wonder how much talent as a director he has. <br /> <br />The film is a gross copycat action of Hong Kong's martial arts movies (if you have watched tens or hundreds of them, you'd know). Tarantino apparently has watched many of them and tried to create his own, but lacking creativity and originality is the biggest issue of this movie. For those not watching many martial art movies, it looks fresh, so Tarantino might think the movie have some market in U.S. He is right in terms of revenue generated.  <br /> <br />The movie is gross and violent, the blood shed in the movie could well support a car wash if you want a red car. But grossness and violence are never the essence of martial arts. It is an art that makes you wonder how beautiful the move is, not how many legs or arms are cut. Jet Li's early films made in Hong Kong truely demonstrate such art. Since when Uma and Lucy become martial arts experts? <br /> <br />I'd not waste my money on the second volume.
B000255LNE|5.0|Phil Collins has long been one of the most \\"honest\\" artists out there. His music always finds a vein in the hurt lover in all of us. This 2-disc collection of his better previously-released love songs and new material is an excellent listening experience. The title says it all, so many of his standards are missing from this collection (\\"In the Air Tonight\\", \\"I Wish It Would Rain Down\\", etc), but his love songs are here (\\"One More Night\\", \\"Do You Remember\\", \\"Separate Lives\\" are just a sampling of what you'll find). His new songs are good too, and show a good direction for the future (I was never a fan of his big band years). While another \\"best of\\" collection seems strange with the release of his other one not long ago, this one is different because it's themed to just his love songs. Four live songs are included here too, including his cover of the old song \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\". Recommended.

B000050HTO|5.0|After years of owning and losing Bob Dylan albums, I decided to buy one CD that would best represent my appreciation for this genius' work. I considered some of the box sets, but eventually purchased the Essentials.  It was money well spent.  <br />This is a complete set for anyone just discovering Bob Dylan, or for old guys like myself who are trying to rediscover the sounds of their youth-without having to buy a dozen CDs. The Essentials covers the range of tunes and styles of Bob Dylan and opens the door for further discovery of his music--by the way, there's a ton of it. <br />Songs like \\"Knock, Knocking on Heaven's Door,\\" and \\"Positively 4th Street\\" remind me of summer days at the Drive-In listening to the jukebox and playing pool (when I had some quarters). The man puts his heart and soul into every song, and you can feel this. He's not some image created by a studio and thrust on the consumer by the media. Dylan came of age before million dollar endorsements and the era of goddesses (britney) who spit out focus group music created by committees for big sales.  Dylan's songs on the other hand, reflect the attitudes, values, and events impacting the time in which they were written. You may think you have never heard Dylan, but I assure you, if you listen to these songs, you will be shocked how much of this man's music is a part of our culture and music traditions. <br />You won't go wrong buying this collection. As for the re-mastering part, I'm skeptical, but then again, my hearing is shot from 40 years of playing my stereo too loud. <br />  <br /> <br />
B00003CXCT|5.0|What an awesome slice of cinema Star Wars is.  ALthough i love the original trilogy i purposefully hadn't seen it for about four years, waiting for the day when it would come out on dvd. And Yes isn't it brilliant! It was a joy to watch the first two prequels before it, if they wern't star wars people would find it easier to enjoy them for the really good fantasy films that they are, then to kick into the classic trilogy after.   I for one really like the changes and additions and am glad they have happened, and i like the connections with the prequel trilogy also.    Star Wars will always be a favourite. The pictures look great, the music ques and effects sound great and the supplementary material is interesting also. One more thing, the acting. What's with people about the acting? if u don't like the films fine but to like the films and think the acting's bad, how does that work? Is it like an Ed Wood film of something? Mark Hamill's job as Luke is spot on, he does a great job of carrying the main out in front adventure plot line & Carrie Fisher provides the perfect background emotive depth for cast chemistry and bridging the dramatic depth not only of the OT, but for the PT-OT series thematic resolution.   All in all, inspiring bold stuff really.
068987474X|5.0|Time to stop getting hurt and have self-respect for ourselves.  We are women.  I went to Barnes & Noble, to buy this book and they said they are completely sold out of their WAREHOUSE.  Can you believe that?  Terrific. Oprah did a good thing by bringing this book to womens attention.  Women need to start having some self-respect and not wasting valuable time on some guy, who really more than likely, is just simply lying, out of \\"being afraid to hurt our feelings\\".  Let's grow up and stop acting like junior high kids and have grown up relationships.    Thank you Oprah and maybe some women can now stop putting their life on hold and truly wake up and live life now.  The book is valuable and take it to heart and realize that a lot of men who would wait, really have baggage that is best to pass up and not get involved in.  The authors are writing truth and I applaud them. Women, as the authors say, you deserve more, don't let a man treat you disrespectfully.

B00005JLWN|4.0|Not sure where the lines of emulation and outright plagiarism comes into play, but mine is not to reason why...I just watch.  A futuristic tale is in the strong shadow of Bradbury's Fahrenheit 411, so strong, that you wonder why they just did not call it an outright remake.  Equilibrium is set in the post World War III era, where they evidently watched Star Trek one time too many and bought into Doctor Spock's lack of emotion is superior to human emotions.  To see this robot-state exists, where all emotions are suppressed, the government ruthlessly removes anything to provoke feelings.  In Bradbury's tales it was books - Fahrenheit 411 being the temperature at which paper burns.  In this movie, it's anything that provokes passion, senses.  Books, Grand Masters' paintings...even puppies.<br /><br />It's beautifully lensed, and writer-director Kurt Wimmer gives you a pinch of this and a dram of that, blending a Metropolis and Fahrenheit 411 feel to paint this bleak picture of the possible future.  Christian Bale (Reign of Fire) turns in a strong performance as the dispassionless top cop, who busts the \\"sense offenders\\" It's no surprise when the work eventually gets to him, and a gentle fuzzy puppy breaks through his already cracking resolve, setting him off in a near one man crusade to make change.  His performance is a tour de force, raising the movie to a<br /><br />stronger level than the basic premise.  His cold, emotionless, mood-flattened state, perpetuated by required drugs, is dead bang on target.  Equally, he convinces you he is a man with a mission, and you feel his near agony, as he is flooded with feeling once again.<br /><br />High marks on the visual blocking of the film and the evocative sets that set the tone for the whole film.

B0002Z0EYK|2.0|From the previews of Troy, one could decide it was going to be a movie that would either be great or terrible. No inbetweens. No kind of good. Black and white good or bad. <br />For me it undeniably falls into the bad category. The movie was long and had some of the worst dialogue I've ever heard in a movie. The plot is basically that of the Illiad. Paris from Troy takes away beautiful Helen, pissing off all of Greece. King Agamemnon uses this as an excuse to invade Troy so he can get the area open for trade. But they can't win the war without Achilles (Brad Pitt) who is such an amazing warrior that he moves in slow motion when he starts killing multiple enemy soldiers at once. Also in the story are Hector, Priam, and some other Greek names you would never recognize unless you read the Illiad. <br />My main problem with the film was the acting. Except for Priam and Hector, there was very little effort in making for interseting dialogue or character to care about. Achilles is made out to be this emotionless killing machine, who finally has his heart openned by a Trojan girl he capture, but kindly abstains from raping AND keeps other soldiers from having their way her either. How sweet, he must have fallen love. <br />The only thing I really enjoyed about this film was the action. There's not a lot one can do to make Greecian warfare cool that hasn't been done before. The way warriors like Achilles and Hector fight is very smooth and fluid and that is captured very nicely when these warriors are featured in battle. Achilles vs. Hector wasn't a badly choreographed fight either. <br />What some people may not like is how little it follows the actual Illiad. Major plot points are missing. Achilles comes up with the Trojan Horse rather than Oddeseyus, and Paris lives freely in the end. I realize that the movie takes and approach that eliminates the appearance of the Greek gods that is prolific in the Illiad, but a few too many liberties are taken for my liking. I think that a better Greek war epic is going to be Alexander. Watch for that coming soon, it looks a thousand times better than Troy. <br />I would not wish this movie upon my worst enemy. But if you really want to see a movie, do you care about the reviews? Of course not. That's why You Got Served was number one in the theaters when it came out.
B00005JMH2|4.0|I saw a sneak preview of this movie over the weekend with a group of fellow students and instructors from our ballroom dance studio.  I absolutely love the original Japanese version of this movie, so I was hesitant to see the remake and had very low expectations.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised!  While the remake cannot capture the charm of the original, it has some charms of it's own.<br /><br />They did have to stretch for a reason why Gere's and Tucci's characters would have to sneak around to take lessons.<br /><br />Tucci's character was a hoot.  They could have left out the homophobia attached to why he was secretly taking lessons.  I don't really think the attitude in America is that all men who ballroom dance are gay.  Most of the guys I know are doing it to impress women and perhaps meet women who totally outnumber them at dance studios.<br /><br />All in all worth seeing, especially if you are a dancer.  You will get all the inside jokes.
B0002KQNJU|4.0|An excellent spoof of classic vampire movies. The style will remind you of some old or silent movie. The characters are almost cartoonish. Especially the Professor. Roman Polanski did a great job with Sharon Tate in this campy comedy. In parts it is spooky, and in others very comical. Sometimes it is even very sensual. A movie well worth seeing if you enjoy vampire movies, but especially if you like comedies. Since this was made in the Sixties it will seem a little low tech when it comes to special effects.<br /><br />It makes up for it in being fun to watch with friends and lovers. The pace of the movie is good and the music is a good match with the action. The costumes are well done and some of the set pieces at the castle are excellent. The quality of the transfer is excellent. The colors are vibrant and the sound is clear. A pity the DVD does not include interviews of Polanski or Tate. It does include a featurette vintage making of \\"The Fearless Vampire Killers\\". I owned the VHS and I am glad to have it on DVD.
0812550757|2.0|Many of the reviewers who disliked this book feel it compares poorly with \\"Ender's Game,\\" which they liked; I'm in the camp of people who dislikes everything of Card's they've read, and who are irritated by his popularity. All of the characters engage in endless attempts at intellectual oneupsmanship, when they aren't tearfully confessing horrible secrets from the long-buried past. Sometimes they even do both at the same time!     Especially irksome is whiny Ender. Despite being constantly mired in self-pity, somehow Ender comes to a strange town, and within a few months, uncovers all the festering, decades-old secrets (adultery! unintentional incest! Princess Diana's albino love-child!) the townsfolk are hiding from each other and starts them on the path to healing, unravels the mysteries of yet another alien race, revives the aliens he destroyed millennia ago, prevents the destruction of a planet, and gets the babe (though to be fair, she doesn't seem much of a prize). This makes Ender unique among the world's messianic figures: he's saved the world twice, while the others have only done it once (I gather he does it at least twice more, but I haven't read the other Ender books, so I can't be sure).     There are other obnoxious features: the idea, which Card adores, of the Speakers for the Dead. These are people who go around digging up the secrets of the dead, and who hold public ceremonies where they reveal the private, hidden lives of these people, holding nothing back. This Card calls a \\"humanistic religion.\\" Leaving aside what an oxymoron that phrase is, let's now imagine that you're dead and in the afterlife, watching your loved ones go about their lives. Would you really want somebody prying into the most personal recesses of your life? all those eccentricities, failures, and dark desires you spent so much time and effort trying to correct and turn to better ends? And would your family enjoy having the public know that, in addition to being the loving parent, good spouse, and decent citizen that in fact you were, you also stole money from the mob and had an illegitimate child when you were young and desperate? Card seems to think so. Since he believes this is such a great idea, I expect he'll have someone Speak for him at his funeral. (I don't however, expect that it will be an honest account of his life).         Card has a webpage. One glance at it makes it clear why he's obsessed with his supergenius characters. The page provides, among other things, a weekly dose of Card's opinions on movies, books, media, and minutiae such as restaurants in his hometown. Another item is a rather strident column on global politics (shades of Locke and Demosthenes). Both reveal Card's secret: he secretly believes he is one of the supergeniuses he writes about. He thinks there's no better judge and jury than he. He burns to be executioner too, but deep down he knows that he doesn't have the guts to be. So he settles for writing about the executioner (i.e., Ender). But he grows dissatisfied: being merely a god of sci-fi is not enough. His longings to shape the real world resurface. But he can only do this through the written word. Hence, a compromise solution: his opinion pieces and political essays.     This digression is quite pertinent to the book. For Card's conviction that his judgment and insight is far beyond that of other men comes through every page of his work. He doesn't trust the audience enough to grasp the emotions and the motives of his characters; he spells it all out (the scene where Ender blabs all the village's secrets in the middle of the church is a particularly ugly example of this). This, of course, proves to the reader that he's so smart that he understands the two-dimensional cartoon characters he's constructed in his own mind.     He has contempt for all his characters besides Ender: they serve merely as clueless plebes enlightened by Ender, enigmatic ciphers whose mysteries are exposed and explained by Ender, vehement opponents of Ender who grudgingly come to admire, and finally to worship him. Thus the novel serves as the room of mirrors which reveals unto Card the divine perfection of Ender, who is secretly Card as he sees himself.     In short: don't bother reading this book. Nor should you bother reading any more of the author's work (in fairness, I have not read any of his non-Ender stuff, so am not qualified to review it).
B000002KD5|5.0|With their self-titled 1975 album, Fleetwood Mac added what would become the two most crucial elements of their classic 70s AOR sound: singer/songwriter Stevie Nicks and guitarist/singer/songwriter Lindsey Buckingham. Their entrance did what Bob Welch only did on occasion: it added an anguished fire to the music, as both added to keyboardist/singer/songwriter Christine McVie's soulful sound to give the group three talented singer/songwriters who each added their own stamp to the band sound. The result was their best album yet. Get this one and RUMOURS first, preferably both at once.
B0002VKZL6|5.0|I have to preface my comments with the admission that I have been a huge fan of Knopfler's since the early '80s.  More than any other artist, his music has been in constant rotation on the evolving soundtrack of my life.  So my bias is pretty transparent. <br /> <br />But this is a beautiful album that should please anyone who has moved beyond the need to hear their favorite musicians simply showing off (a Van Halen record might do for those - no offense to Eddie).   <br /> <br />My favorite tracks are \\"5:15 am,\\"  \\"the trawlerman's song,\\" \\"shangri-la,\\" \\"everybody pays, \\"postcards from paraquay,\\" and \\"all that matters.\\"  But every song seems excellent to me. The tunes and the playing are impeccable; as you might expect. But it's the lyrics that really drive the album.  Mr. Knopfler is still a bit of a teacher for anyone with the good sense to pay attention to what he is saying.   <br /> <br />Like many fans, I also wish to hear him \\"air it out\\" occasionally and blow us away with his virtuosity (ala \\"Speedway at Nazareth\\").  But apart from the lack of extended solo excursions, I can't find any fault at all with this offering.  We'll just have to catch him on tour to hear our collective jaws drop in humble awe of his playing.  For now, this album satisfies me just fine! <br /> <br />
B00005AXEL|5.0|TROUBLE IN SHANGRI-LA is the best Stevie Nicks solo album since THE WILD HEART. In between, she quit drugs (cocaine and prescription tranquilizers) and smoking, lost a tremendous amount of weight, and did a lot of thinking about what she wanted out of life. The result is one of her best albums ever, with or without Fleetwood Mac. The guest stars who appear do so without overshadowing Nicks, unlike on Santana's SUPERNATURAL, and, in fact, they actually add to the feel of the album, which has kind of an Outlaws-y vibe to it, but with 21st century touches. Many of the songs have a cautionary and/or self-analytical feel to their lyrics, especially the title track, which, with its line \\"We all believe in people, that we think believe in God, Somewhere in the night, someone feels the pain\\", which is about how we tend to choose the wrong role models. It was allegedly, according to Nicks herself, inspired by O.J. Simpson's 1994-95 trial, and mirrors why several young women I've liked over the years requested that I not take him as an inspiration to get in shape for them. This should be one of the first Stevie Nicks solo albums you buy, along with BELLA DONNA and THE WILD HEART.
037542217X|4.0|Mma Precious Ramotswe, proprietor of the #1 Ladies Detective Agency in Gaborone, is a much-respected, traditional woman (of \\"traditional size\\") who honors the customs of Botswana and tries to solve problems for her clients the \\"traditional\\" way--through her broad network of friends and family with whom she can sit down, drink bush tea, and \\"talk about very small things,\\" as she searches for clues. She is a warm and happy woman of good sense, and her detective agency is a huge success because of her discretion and care for her clients' feelings.<br /><br />In this novel, full of gentle humor and wisdom, Mma Ramotswe deals with two clients, one of whom committed a minor crime many years ago and for which he now wants to make amends, and one of whom is worried about a philandering husband. Both cases require the utmost in tact and sensitivity. Mma Ramotswe is also concerned with some personal matters. A rival detective agency, run by an aggressive man, opens an office in Gaborone to great fanfare, and he publicly demeans the #1 Ladies Detective Agency in a news feature. Mma Ramotswe's fianc&eacute;, Mr. J. L. B. Matakone still has not set a wedding date, though he clearly loves her, and one of the young orphans she and Mr. J. L. B. Matakone are mentoring, begins to have serious behavior problems. In addition, Mma Makutsi, Mma Ramotswe's assistant, who is barely making ends meet with her current jobs, decides to open a typing school for men after work. Mma Makutsi soon falls in love with one of her students, someone Mma Ramotswe finds inappropriate.<br /><br />Domestic issues and human relationships, rather than exciting plot lines, keep the focus on the characters--beautifully drawn, sometimes flawed, and always forgiven their faults. In a pace as relaxed as life in Botswana, author Alexander McCall Smith recreates the colorful everyday lives of these ordinary people, who treasure friendships, treat each other with respect, and possess inherent good sense. In simple, direct prose filled with homely details, the author celebrates a traditional lifestyle and its values during a time in which change may become inevitable.

B00001MXXH|5.0|Ferris Bueller's day off   Ferris Bueller's day is a classic comedy that is a must see.  The movie takes place in Chicago and the suburbs of Chicago.  This movie was filmed in the 80's and does a good job of portraying the styles of the 80's.  The whole time however Ferris has found ways around getting into and out of trouble.  Ferris decides to miss school like he has several times so far in the school year.  His best friend, Cameron Frye (who also doesn't go to school on this day) is at home while Ferris convinces him to hang out while they have a wild and crazy day off.    My favorite quote from this movie is when Ferris says \\"Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop to look around once in a while, you could miss it.\\"   He first fakes being sick, which was the easy part.  People think that he's dieing of some life threatening disease.  Meanwhile, his sister knows that he's faking and she tries to find a way to catch him in the act, because she doesn't think its fair that she has to go to school when he doesn't and he always gets away with everything.  It seems like he and his sister are competing with each other throughout the whole movie.  She got a car when she turned sixteen, and Ferris got a computer when he turned sixteen.  But Ferris uses his computer to get him out of school trouble and she will just leave and get into more trouble.    But this movie isn't only about his sister its more about him.  He doesn't have much planned on his journey for fun but he does know that this will definitely be a day to remember.  Once he and Cameron meet up at Cameron's, he decides to call out his girlfriend from high school.  With much humor Cameron called the high school as her dad saying that there has been a death in the family and she would have to leave to go the funeral.  The principal, Ed Rooney however, knows that her boyfriend is Ferris and doesn't believe the call is actually Ferris.  He says things that he shouldn't say to Sloane's  father if her grandmotherreally did die.  Then as they're having the conversation Ferris calls the high school.  The secretary, Grace, is going nuts because Ed thinks he talking to Farris when he was not. Farris called in to ask the school to give the books and any school work that he missed to his sister.  Then Ed, in shock, apologizes to Sloane's father and the whole time it was Cameron on the phone.  Ed, throughout the whole movie is determined to catch Ferris in his own game and even leaves school, and breaks into the Bueller household to catch him, but he always fails.   Somehow Ferris got Cameron to take his dads Ferrari out to pick up Sloane and they go Chicago and see and do many things that are crazy.  I could tell you them but I think that you should see this amazing movie for yourself and laugh throughout all the humor is has.  You will not be disappointed when you but or rent this movie.  I've never heard of anyone who did not like this movie.
B0001MDP3G|5.0|This movie is one of the best made in the past few years, if not THE best! After watching the movie, I could not understand why it wasn't even nominated for the best film/screenplay for Oscars. IMHO it beats Lord of the Rings hands down! It is not a perfect movie (for example, Kidman's performance is 8 out of 10, compared to best supporting actress, which deserves Oscar for sure!), but its deep perception of history and human nature, and the love behind it, has no peers in recent memory. The only thing even close to its greatness, is probably Shawshank Redemption and Schindler's List.     It takes a big/mature heart and good understanding of life to really appreciate its power, behind apparent calmness. Or in other words, you need to sit down, relax and watch this movie. It's not a fast pace action style movie. If you are used to that, then this is a bad choice for you.
B00003CXCT|5.0|A great transfer onto DVD.  I know that some complain about the fact that the \\"original print\\" is included, but in my opinion these versions with the addition's ( SW fans know where they all occur so I won't give a run down ) and CGI enhancements make the film even better.  <br /> <br />The only one I will mention (as an example) is when the X-Wing's take off to go and take on the Death Star. Look at the original version and try to tell me that it looks better than the close up version of the X-Wings flying towards the Death Star in the Special Edition. <br /> <br />Anyway, if you remember when the special editions were released on VHS a fews years back, it was explained that the original film print had deteriorated so much, that it was almost unwatchable (we are talking about 20+ year old film here boys and girls). Who would want an \\"original print\\" in that condition transferred to DVD ? <br /> <br />The doco's are very imformative with plenty of behind the scene's footage.  It would of been great if the set included the original \\"Makings of...\\" series that come out prior to the original cinema releases.  Mind you, I find that with Special Features on any DVD, I normally only look at them once or twice no matter how intersting they are - you get the DVD for the actual movie anyway. <br /> <br />The sound and picture are great - I don't own a huge home theatre set-up so I am probably not the right person to voice a hi-tech opinon on how it sounds in 5.1 or looks on a large wide screen tv, but for the average-joe with a DVD player, Stereo and TV setup it all looks fine. <br /> <br />I won't comment on the actual movie/story line because if you have never seen Star Wars, chances are you would not even be reading this.  We all know how good it is and has changed the world of sci-fi since 1977 !!!   <br /> <br />Get the DVD set - if you don't like it then I would suggest you are a hard person to please !!!!!! <br /> <br />

This is an amazing movie that shows people what is not normally seen of war/business/politics.  Seven minutes of doing nothing, except trying not to scare or frighten childre...good choice mr. bush.

We tell a different story about the Alamo than the Mexicans teach at their schools!! When we present Russians, Cubans and Japanese during times of conflicts, we were biased. We never mentioned anything good about them. Nothing!! <br /> <br />The fact is that in this movie, there are facts. Facts we can not hide. There are also lost of conspiracy theories from Michael Moore. Nevertheless, it's a provoking movie with a strong message and very intelligent questions to our government. Why Iraq?

0805062971|5.0|I absolutely loved the Fight Club movie. Having said that, I don't think you can truly understand the intentions of the movie without reading the book. This book actually made me think about my life in a way I had never considered before. That's power in my eyes. Chuck Palahniuk seems to write more for the message than the story, and the messages in this book, if thought properly through, would change a lot of people's perspectives on life, and the driving forces behind what we are, how we got there, and why we don't change. I recommend this book to anyone.
0671027573|2.0|I read Mr. Perfect--I stayed up all night to do so. I was determined to finish the book, hoping it would become better but it didn't. Unfortunately, the author is in writing slump. The character, Jaine, was very similar to another one of the author's characters (a woman who was a butler) and Sam, like the police officer in the other story, was basically the same type of person. The duplicate descriptions of both men was disappointing; I expected Ms. Howard to be more creative. The cursing, I suppose, was meant to be humorous but I didn't find it so. I thought it was just thrown into the story. If anything, it made me wonder why a such an intelligent woman had to use that kind of language. Sure, I'm no angel but her language was too much. (...)  Jaine wasn't bothered that Sam referred to his ex-wife as the b-word; I was. It shows he was still bitter and may have had some \\"issues.\\" As a woman engaged three times, you would think Jaine wouldn't say yes so quickly.    The characters go from hate, to lust, to love, to a marriage proposal in a week. In between Jaine loses two of her closest friends, her house is vandalized and she has an incredible amount of instant celebrity. When in the world did the characters find time to know each other? Jaine seemed more concerned about Sam's penis size. How sad, shallow and stupid! Not once did they sit and discuss their childhood, dreams, goals, anything. In just a few days, Jaine had sex with a stranger. She started birth control pills during the weekk--a Monday, I believe. Most birth control pills start the first Sunday of or after your cycle.    Jaine's five minutes of grief were unbelievable. She cried, then wiped her tears and jumped back in the bed with Sam. People handle grief in their own way but Jaine's reaction was so unrealistic.     Supposedly, Jaine was nervous about the attention and attracting loonies but in one scene Sam comes over and opens the door while Jaine and Shelley were in the kitchen. She didn't even lockher!   She even went through the trouble of buying a new door. Did Ms.Howard forget that detail?    All of the characters were two-dimensional. I liked T.J and Luna, best.  However, T.J. worrying about her husband's reaction to a stupid list was so silly.    I really didn't like Jaine or Sam. They deserve each other.    It may be awhile before I pick up another Howard novel.

I recommend the board book version because of the different size pages and great holes the caterpillar has \\"chewed\\" in it. My son puts his fingers in the holes, and I tickle them from the other side, telling him the caterpillar is getting him. He LOVES this book!
1592400876|1.0|I was hoping for a guide with which to improve my punctuation. Instead, I endured a psudo-intellectual snob touting her superior brain and whining about the stupidity of everyone else on the planet. The author fails to realize that a display of specialized skill,(a fixation with punctuation) does not denote overall mental superiority. Even if it did, I wouldn't care to spend my time reading poison-tipped sarcasm rather than improving my punctuation skills.
B00005JMJG|5.0|\\"How happy is the blameless Vestal's lot!<br /><br />The world forgetting, by the world forgot.<br /><br />Eternal sun-shine of the spotless mind!<br /><br />Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd.\\"<br /><br />Nearly three hundred years ago Alexander Pope in his poem \\"Eloisa to Abelard\\" satirized a world that mistakenly assigned \\"virtue\\" to the cloistered and empty life.  What is the virtue of innocence when one simply fails to make any mark at all on the world?  To \\"forget\\" the world and avoid its temptations and ignore its intrinsic unfairness is to miss engaging with the defining part of what it is to be human.<br /><br />Charlie Kaufman takes Pope's criticism of the \\"virtue of avoidance\\" and turns it on modern society.  What he targets is our present-day habit of routinely turning to medicine and drugs to cushion ourselves from the pain and unpleasantness of everyday life.  Instead of dealing with reality, we simply \\"take a stress pill\\" as Kubrick's HAL9000 computer of \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" advises.  Yet the narcotized bliss we experience is as empty as Pope's hollow virtue.  We feel nothing but we also learn nothing about ourselves.<br /><br />Don't expect the annoying, mugging Jim Carrey of \\"Ace Ventura\\" and \\"Dumb and Dumber.\\"  Here he plays Joel, a hermit-like nebbish whose life is briefly transformed by a chance encounter with a quirky extrovert, Clementine (Kate Winslet).  When their relationship goes sour, he must confront his return to the emptiness of his prior existence.  After learning that the memories of their brief affair can be destroyed by a simple outpatient procedure, he opts to avoid the pain by having the memory of her surgically \\"removed.\\"<br /><br />Yet after the procedure begins, the unconscious Joel begins to regret his decision and realizes that -- despite the pain he associates with their past relationship -- he must protect and defend his memories of Clementine from a doctor intent on tracking them down and destroying them in amad chase through the labyrinthian passages of Joel's mind.<br /><br />This movie is not for everyone -- but it should be.  I give it five stars because in a world of mindless entertainment, this movie not only challenges you to keep up with its frenetic pace, it gives you the chance to be a bit better off than you were when you started.  Not all movies are worth the two hours of life spent watching them.  This one is.
B00005JNEI|5.0|I'm a well-educated (2 advanced degrees) and well-infomed former Marine Corps officer and I thought I'd seen and read everything there was to know about the war in Iraq, 9/11 and terrorism. I was wrong. This documentary opened my eyes to many facts that left me and my wife absolutely dumfounded. It was also very funny in places and generally very entertaining. I don't agree with all of Moore's conclusions, but the main thrust of his film, the deceits and treachery of the Bush Administration, are incontrovertible and have never been disproved by the Wing Nuts who claim he's a liar. You owe it to yourself and your country to see this amazing film.
B000062XM3|4.0|Director David Fincher, who brought us into the extraordinarily depraved serial-killer world of Se7en (1995), fires up the shock cauldron again with this high testosterone examination of our primal need to seek adrenaline highs through physical violence.  His message seems to be that we are not really alive unless we are involved in something extreme.<br /><br />Ed Norton plays the Narrator, a corporate structure cog with insomnia who gets off (and finds the arms of Morpheus) by going to therapy groups for people with cancer, disfigurement, drug addiction, etc.  The idea is that seeing the acute and terrible misery of others affords him a catharsis that clears the neuro-emotional blockage and allows him to relax enough to get some sleep.<br /><br />But after a while he begins to notice Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter--no relation to Hillary Rodham Clinton--ha, ha) hanging out at some of the meetings.  Her hair and eyes are black widow black, all the better to set off her pasty white skin, giving her a witchy/sexy allure that really in itself ought to excite Norton's deadened neurons.  (I know she excited mine.)  But instead what her presence at the talk-therapy sessions does is remind him that he isn't really suffering like the others, and once again he has insomnia.<br /><br />Meanwhile he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) a handsome and virile beauty soap salesman who is quick with the banter and has the confidence of a demi-god, something Norton's character lacks.  They become best buds (and a bit more) after Durden introduces him to the full-out adrenaline rush of getting your face pounded in.  As the fight club scenes unfold, getting more and more ridiculous with each bone-crunching punch and each darkening pool of blood, more and more young men join the club allowing Tyler Durden to become an underground hero and charismatic leader of human sheep dressed in black.  By the way, the real truth of the postmodern cowboy fisticuffs is that the participants couldn't even stand the injury to their hands from one punch, let alone the repeated blows to face, head and body.<br /><br />But never mind.  There's a lot more to this movie than phony fight scenes.  The strange thing is a lot of the scenes are funny!  Somehow an aura of humor adheres to Fincher's street mayhem, rock-the-house sex, and body-slamming/bone-cracking absurdities.  Not only that but the acting by the principals and Meat Loaf's massively-breasted Bob Paulson is excellent.  Norton's confused and determined whimsy is nicely off-set by Pitt's brazen pathology.  The story plays out well with some nice surprises and some good tension.  You will not be bored.<br /><br />Philosophically speaking too there is more than a grain of truth in the thesis: we really are divorced to some extent from our primal nature.  We are animals who have domesticated ourselves.  A return to the jungle (for example, by watching this film) energizes us and reminds us that part of our nature is largely incompatible with civilization.<br /><br />Be forewarned however that this is a grossly violent movie that is difficult to watch at times.  Fincher's primary intent is to shock, and he works hard at that.  The scene at the back alley of a liposuction clinic as our boys are dumpster-diving for soap ingredients is particularly grossitating.  When one of the bags holding human fat gets snagged on a barbed wire fence, it bursts, dripping it contents onto the Narrator.<br /><br />If you can stand this sort of thing, watch and be beguiled or revolted, but first, please send the kiddies to bed.uldn't even stand the injury to their hands from one punch, let alone the repeated blows to face, head and body. <br /> <br />But never mind.

0765301598|4.0|The last two current Dune trilogies are much more beach novels than the hardcore philosophical based science fiction of Frank Herbert's Dune.  This is fine by me, and I think once you can get over it and accept it for something completely different, then you can enjoy it (note - I understand people who can't read it - I love Asimov's Foundation series, but I can't stand the prequels).    So, assuming that you've read the other two novels in the Butlerian Jihad series, then you'll get what you expected out of this finale. <br /> <br />First off, the main problem is the structure of the book.  Each chapter is something like four pages and each one deals with a different subplot.  Fine - except for the fact that the story will be built up, then you won't hear anything about that story for another thirty pages.  By the time you get back to that part of story, you really don't care anymore. <br /> <br />This is made worse by the fact that pages 250-500 are really dull as you have to wait for the inevitable conclusion by dealing with random people or plots that you really can't care about. <br /> <br />The book suffers from some horrible structure and waiting that just makes it a pain to read. <br /> <br />There are also some problems with whole Robots torturing people or arguing with each other, along with other things that just make no sense. <br /> <br />Now for the good stuff (skip this paragraph if you want to avoid possible spoilers).  You get the final battles that you wanted.  You get to see the beginning of Atriedes - Harkonnen feud.  You get the first Space Guild Navigator.  You get to witness the start of Bene Gesserit.  You get to see that start of the Suk doctors.  You get the beginning of the Corrino dynasty.  You get to see the first Mentat.  All in all, this is what I wanted all along.  You've heard about these topics from the original Dune novels, and it's really satisfying to know the origins.  I guess the only problem I had with it was that everything was wrapped up too conveniently. <br /> <br />Also, the writing style of the authors is fluid and interesting, and if they could have just structured it better, would have made for a book that would have been impossible to put down. <br /> <br />So, if you want to know more about the Dune elements and don't have the \\"this is not Frank Herbert\\" hang ups, this is your book.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|I don't think it quite stacks up to Mer De Noms, hence 4 instead of 5 stars, but well worth the money. <br /> <br />As to the review that stated something like art and politics don't mix....ever hear of a band called Rage Against The Machine?  They may not be together any more, but they released some of the best music for that time period that they were together. <br /> <br />Anyway, if you liked the last Perfect Circle, try this one out as well.
B00005JMXX|4.0|This movie is great if you have no belief in science. <br /> <br />It's what it is, a fun popcorn flick that is watchable on a rainy Saturday afternoon.  The special effects are good, the cast is top notch, however the material is full of holes and the dialogue is cheesy. <br /> <br />See it once.  That's all you'll need.
B0000CDNWE|5.0|this is a totally predictable film, but so what? most films are, and, besides, it's not where you end up but the journey along the way that makes the ride good or bad. and this is definitely a good ride. high points are the acting - especially of the little girl who has great charm and charisma - and the cinematography of the nz coastline which looks mahvelous. it's a trend nowadays to play up traditional cultures, but i think it's a good thing when it's done as well as it is here. one comes away with new respect for a culture that one knows little about, and a better appreciation for the importance of keeping touch with one's roots. if a movie like this can make more people realize the importance of cultural and ethnic diversity, then it will have done a real service, over and above being 'just' good entertainment which it certainly is.
B00000AFWZ|4.0|The stuff on here is a little polished for my taste, most doesn't sound natural (like most pop music), it sounds like it was crafted in a studio. Though there are some great punkers on here like the Gonn track, \\"Knock Knock\\", and the Unrelated Segments. Fans of '60s pop music probably won't like it though, neither will die hard garage fanatics like me. But it is good to have, cause much of this stuff isn't available anywhere else. For me, I'll stick to the Back From the Grave series, which rarely leaves my CD player, Nuggets unfortunatley hardley ever goes in my CD player, though sometimes I need to listen to \\"Sugar and Spice\\", so it's good to have around.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Almost all reviews give this movie either 5 stars or 1 star. This should tell you something.

0671510991|5.0|Dr. Kissinger's affection for his adopted country is refreshing in this age of national self-doubt.  He continuously refers to America's \\"exceptionalism\\" as embodying a new motivation in foreign affairs and in diplomacy.  Now, ten years after its publication, Dr. Kissinger's book can explain how we are still so sorely misunderstood by the community of nations, and particularly by our allies.  Throughout history, nations have followed policies which support their own self-interest, \\"realpolitik,\\" or have created alliances against the powerful, \\"balance of power.\\"  Still others have cast a protective net over one geopolitical realm or another, \\"spheres of influence.\\"  For the first time in history, America represents a nation which has been motivated principally by doing what is right.  Basing foreign policy on liberty, democracy, and self-determinatioin is the essence of \\"Wilsonian\\" statecraft, or simply \\"exceptionalism.\\"  As a German Jew, Dr. Kissinger was a beneficiary of America's altruism, generosity, and melting pot immigration policies.  He has repaid that debt by serving America at the highest levels of government.  Cynics have written that Dr. Kissinger is obsessed with crafting his own legacy.  The fact is that America benefitted from his historic perspective as a representative of American exceptionalism.  He played historic roles in the US' opening to China, in the negotiations to end the Vietnam war, and the policies leading to the end of the cold war.  His insight corrects some past interpretations of modern American history, and can illuminate our path forward.  Dr. Kissinger points out that exceptions to American exceptionalism have occured when our policies conflict with our ideals, such as in Vietnam.  The bad old ways of handling foreign affairs are still standard operating procedures among our fellow nations and an enhanced understanding of them is critical if American exceptionalism is to energize our future.  Dr. Kissinger has written an awe-inspiring book about the formative years of an exceptional country, and even if he does feature himself in a few chapters, he can be forgiven.  He can only serve as an affirmative model for future diplomats.  The more we have like him, the longer our country will serve as a champion of democracy and self-determination.iring book about the formative years of an exceptional country, and even if he does feature himself in a few chapters, he can be forgiven.

B0002ZDVEU|5.0|the first was good, but im not sure why, i just thought it seemed to mainstream hollywood, and the fight scenes weren't that great. but the camera work in this is genius. it adds a whole new level to the film and gives it a much more cool, exciting, and intriuging style. the direction and editing is great, the first really seems like more of a set up than a movie, but now, now we have the REAL film hopefully a third is on the way, and with any luck, they wont listen to all these stupid b*stards saying that the direction is dumb, or that the hand held camera was a bad idea. the best thing about this is that [probably since it was very rushed during production] it seems very fast and gritty. this is my kinda action flick.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|This is what I wrote with regards to A.Keys album on Dec.2nd 2003 <br /> <br />Alicia Keys is back with her sophmore album titled \\"Diary\\". Yet again she has proved that she is no gimmick. Ms. Keys has proven that she is such a true lyricist, a true performer...a true everything. Songs such as \\"Diary\\", \\"If I Ain't Got You\\", and \\"Karma\\", tells a tale that she is a woman-\\"lord knows its hard\\". Alicia's first single \\"You Don't Know My Name\\" was produced by Chicago's own Kanye West. Mesmirized by her mellonic tone and sculpture of words, voice and music, her fans will watch as her career grows. Clive Davis was searching for a long lasting artist...he did not know that he also found an angel. <br /> <br />Well today, I will still stay by my words. She is why I continue to strive for my aspirations for being in the business (corporate wise). She is a great performer and her album is still worth the listen. If you don't have it, get it!
B00005YJMX|4.0|I will be honest.  When I first began this film, upon seeing the first ten minutes, I was frightened.  Not because there was anything to be frightened about, but because of the low-grade production value that was very clear.  The cheap sets, the cheesy actors with horrible English dubbing, coupled with a soundtrack that could easily raise the dead, I was ready to watch this film crash and burn.  Oddly, this only happened within the first ten minutes, once Harker gets to Dracula's castle, we are handed huge portions of the meat and potatoes of this film.  Nosferatu transforms right in front of your eyes from a cheesy horror flick to a mind-bending horror classic that deserves the cult following it has obtained.  This was one of those films that you should sit and enjoy throughout the entire film, and do not judge it on just the first few minutes.  Get into the story, and I think you will be impressed.<br /><br />There were two parts that stuck out the most in my mind.  These were two scenes that proved to me that I was in fact witnessing cinema in its rawest form.  The first is when Dracula is running down the streets of Virna seemingly random, but imaginatively pure.  He is searching for the woman he dreams about, Lucy Harker.  He has the expression of a kid in a candy store for the very first time.  This is classic avant-garde filmmaking at its best.  You could tell that money was tight for this production, but somehow the masterful eye of director Werner Herzog kept it all together.  His scenes were, to say the least, brilliant.  There were some very starchy moments, but all together he kept a very vivacious spirit alive in this film.  Again, it just took about ten minutes to get into the full package of Nosferatu.<br /><br />The second favorite scene of mine is the stoic Last Supper scene that confused me at first, but after finishing the film made much more sense.  The plague was infesting this little town, and the citizens knew they were going to die ... immorality was a desire of only one person, Dracula, so why not celebrate in the best way possible.  I know there are other ways to see this scene, but I just saw a hopeless class of people living life for the possible last time.  It was visionary and beautiful all at the same time.<br /><br />While these scenes really helped create the aura of the film, it was purely the work of the actors that kept my mind focused on the screen.  My favorite of all the characters presented was Roland Topor's portrayal of Renfield.  His sinister, yet uncontrolled, laughter spooked me.  His face was goofy, and believable.  He embodied the sense of insanity and used it well for his character.  Second, was Kinski as Dracula.  Where did they find this guy?  I do not believe that vanity was anywhere included in his vision of Dracula.  He was scary, curious, and insatiable all at the same time.  His portrayal of Dracula beats Gary Oldman any day (I have not seen the 1922 version with Shrek ... so I stand to what I say ... for now).  Overall, everyone from Lucy Harker to a very unused Van Helsing was superb and really carried this film off the ground.<br /><br />The only disappointing aspect of this film was the DVD.  Normally, I can look past horrible reproductions of film as they gradually make it to digital format, but this was uncalled for.  Here we have a beautiful film with some very good acting and direction, and all we have is a Chapters menu and Start Film.  I was sad to see this.  I wanted some more history on this film and to know more about these actors.  I was a first time viewer that desired more knowledge.  Secondly, the sound mixing was off.  Perhaps it was off the entire film, but the actors at times seemed to be saying one thing with their lips, and out came something completely different from their voices.  It was a very strange distraction that unfocused me from this film.<br /><br />Overall, with the recent popularity of the Hollywood lack-luster Van Helsing, it was sheer enjoyment to go back to the classics and see where Van Helsing found his start.  This was a beautiful film that should be viewed by everyone, but waited until another version is released on DVD.  This just didn't make the grade for me.<br /><br />Grade: **** out of *****it was sheer enjoyment to go back to the classics and see where Van Helsing found his start.

B0000027RL|5.0|This is considered by many to be the landmark album of grunge music in the early 90s. (Yea yea, and Nirvana-Nevermind). This to me is the preferred one.  <br /> <br />This album is all about childhood trauma and what became of it. The songs refer to be who've lost themselves, ended up in mental institutions, and as well as broken homes, abortion, and pain and regret. Eddie Vedder displays all these stories and experiences with the force of hurricane, Vedder is in your face with everything on this album. <br /> <br />Musically, this is anthemic rock at it's finest. Songs like \\"Evenflow\\" \\"Alive\\" and \\"Jeremy\\" are perfect examples. All these songs rock hard, except for the melancholic masterpiece \\"Black\\" and the one song that takes time to appreciate \\"Oceans\\". Capping off Ten is the ending track \\"Realease\\". This song can be seen as one of PJ's saddest songs. It's about how someone has tried to get over the past, but is trapped by it, screaming \\"RELEASE ME!!!!\\". This is my favorite Pearl Jam song, and will no doubt be one of yours. <br /> <br />Is this album worth buying? In my critcal opinion, definitely yes. Ten is a perfect example of what a grunge album should be.
6305558167|1.0|I fear I'm going to get an ear bashing when this gets read, and I expect to have just as many people voting against it like my original Dawn of the Dead movie. I LOVED the Merlin TV movie that was made a few years ago with Sam Neill, and that got me interested in seeing other movies about the King Arthur myth/legend. This got recommended, so I really looked forward to watching it. However, I'm sorely disappointed, and hate giving this movie one star, but I can't give it anymore. Anyone who describes this movie as \\"enchanting, bombastic, captivating, breathtaking, operatic\\" to quote another reviewer, was obviously not watching the same movie I was. I strongly suggest you watch Merlin. I don't know why, but the scenery was so much more breath taking, and the characters had more of a prescence about them rather than the ones in Excalibur. Sure, it's the same characters, plus a few other British actors. Merlin in this I felt was almost evil. And the rest of the characters were just dull as dishwater. If I could NOT review this movie, and pretend I did like it, I would, but don't make me sit through anymore King Arthur movies. I'll stick to Merlin and be quite happy.<br /><br />Sorry.
0451196716|4.0|The book The Long Walk is probably the most shocking book you'll ever read. It was an amazing book cover to cover, because when you aren't wondering what these kids are doing, you are trying to figure out who was going to make it to the end. It kept my attention the entire time and I would find myself up late at night, needing to get up early, reading this suspenseful book. Stephen King did a very good job writing this one as he does with all his books. He wrote it under the name of Richard Bachman as he did with many books early in his career until this secret was discovered. <br />  <br />The book is centered around a boy named Ray Garraty who has been invited to be a part of the long walk. The long walk is a race/contest that everyone in the country knows well and respects. Everyone seems to want to have their kid be a part of it, mainly because of the prize you get if you're the winner. King never gets too specific with what the prize is; he leaves that up to your imagination. To win this race you have to walk an extremely long distance without stopping, never going below the speed of four mph. This means you're not able to stop for anything, including eating, going to the bathroom and there's absolutely no sleeping. If you slow down too many times or break any of the rules, you are eliminated from the contest. That's the reason that the race lasts so long is because it doesn't end until there is only one person left. No one is willing to give up and lose after all the hard work they've done. Then, of course, there's some extra motivation to not fall behind that I will not mention so as not to ruin the book for you. During the book you get to see how the boys react to what's going on around them and the bonds they make with each other. King does a really good job of showing how people would actually react in the situation and also shows certain other, more, insane ways of acting that legitimately could happen. <br />As you read this book and come to realize whatis actually going on, you start to wonder what kind of society and government would allow something like this to happen. Not only that, but what kind of people watch and look forward to such an event. I think one of the things King might be getting at is the way that people can be entertained by the most disturbing things. This event is watched on TV and respected by people across the country. But when people who are watching this in person find out what is going on, their reaction is no longer an entertained one, it's more of a shocked and surprised reaction. It kind of shows how people don't really know what's going on in the world they are entertained by. They watch these things thinking it's something so great, but when you see it in real life you realize that it's a horrible thing to go through. This is one of the things I like about Stephen King books; he creates an incredible story and then also puts some meaning behind it that makes you think. <br />Over all this is one of the best books I've ever read. It was interesting, suspenseful and terrifying like most of King's books. The only problem I had with the book was the ending. I am, however, rarely satisfied with endings, but in this story there really is no winner to the contest. Yes, someone does finish the contest but it definitely is not a happy ending and just kind of leaves you off in mid thought. Sometimes this just adds to the story and makes you use your imagination a bit, but I would like to have a little more closure to it. Despite this, The Long Walk comes highly recommended from me and would be enjoyed by anyone who is a fan of reading.
B00005JMJG|3.0|Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind had a very interesting concept for a movie, and a twist on your typical rom-com movie. It is basically about the way interfering with memories can result in something bad - ie. The Butterfly Effect & Total Recall.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Jim Carrey playing the funny man in movies, then I suggest you don't see this movie, unless you're interested in seeing him play a relatively different role. What shocked me was his appearance in this. He looked really old. It's these bags under his eyes, and grooves down the side of his mouth, and the hair was unwashed, and he was unshaven a lot of the time.<br /><br />The start credits don't start until 17 minutes into the movie which is a very cool effect. There is one main story, the love between Clementine (Kate Winslet wearing a wide selection of wacky wigs) and Joel, and an underlying story between Kirsten Dunst's character, and the doctor of Lacuna Inc. Which seemed pretty much pointless, as there was no incline that they had a \\"past\\", and suddenly it just happens for no reason. But I suppose if you haven't seen this movie, then expect the unexpected.<br /><br />There are quite a few scenes which were cut out of the script for this movie, which I reckon would have been very interesting. The original script featured a cut beginning and ending sequence that took place in the future. In the end, an older Clementine comes in to have the procedure done and a look at her screen shows that she's had the procedure done multiple times and all of them involved Joel. At the very end of the script, an older Joel calls Clementine to ask why she hasn't called, but the technicians performing the procedure erase his message. Other cuts in the original script include a montage of memories people wanted erased, including a soldier seeing his dead friend on a battlefield and a girl who was raped at a young age. Another sub plot dropped from the script was Mary ( Kirsten Dunst) finding out that Howard made her get an abortion after they had the affair resulting in her desire to have her memory wiped.<br /><br />If you look at your DVD collection and find mostly rom-coms (not me of course!) then this is the DVD for you to get. It's certainly a romance with a twist. I can't say I was that keen on Jim Carrey not playing the funny guy. And he had TWO assistants listed in the credits, plus hair and makeup people who weren't needed! This will also get you thinking, as I know for certain, if I went through this procedure, I would lose quite a few years of my life! Imagine all those memories, just gone.Howard made her get an abortion after they had the affair resulting in her desire to have her memory wiped. <br /> <br />If you look at your DVD collection and find mostly rom-coms (not me of course!) then this is the DVD for you to get.

She's come back for a few new songs every now and then, but her greatest hits are undoubtably in the eighties. Madonna's album \\"The Immaculate Collection\\" is a collection of some her greatest hits and chart toppers.  <br /> This album includes such songs as \\"Material Girl\\", \\"Like a Virgin\\", \\"Lucky Star\\", and \\"Like a prayer\\". All of these songs are top-10 chart toppers from 1984 to the mid 1990's. Everyone knows Madonna, and I think that this is one of those cds where you buy it and like almost every song on it not just one or two of them. This is definitely a necessary album in a any home, whether you enjoy Madonna or not. Every likes at least one Madonna song or knows the words to at least one and will sing along whether they like to admit it or not. <br /> Madonna has come out with some new music as recently as the past few years, such as \\"Music\\", but these are the classics that everyone likes. Many will argue about just which song on this cd is \\"the best one\\". There's a song for anyone even if you don't particularly like Madonna. These songs are all classic Madonna songs, which can be enjoyed by everyone. <br /> Some hits on this cd are \\"Like a Prayer\\", known for it's controversial video, from the album \\"Like a Prayer\\". \\"Material Girl\\", from the album \\"Like a Virgin\\", was said to be a song Madonna hated. \\"Lucky Star\\" was a single off of Madonna's first album, \\"Madonna\\". Other songs on this cd include: \\"Holiday\\", \\"Borderline\\", \\"Like a Virgin\\", \\"Crazy for You\\", \\"Into the Groove\\", \\"Live to tell\\", \\"Papa Don't Preach\\", \\"Open Your Heart\\", \\"La Isla Bonita\\", \\"Express Yourself\\", \\"Cherish\\", \\"Vouge\\", \\"Justify My Love\\", and \\"Rescue Me\\". With that many hit songs, there has to be at least a few everyone will like when they listen to this album.  <br /> My personal favorite song is \\"Material Girl\\". I have many memories of this song when I was younger and it's a favorite of my mom's and mine. I like this song best because it has a good beat, it's catchy and it gets you pumped and motivated. This, like I mentioned before was not one of Madonna's favorites, but almost everyone, Madonna fan or not knows most of these songs, just due to their popularity. No one can say they've never heard a song off of this cd, whether they like the song or not. Out of all of these songs, you are almost certain to find at least one you know. Almost everyone can find themselves listening to this cd and unknowingly singing along with the song, whether they like Madonna or not. <br /> This cd has songs for every mood. Whether you want a slower song, or a faster, more upbeat song, this cd has a little of everything, and all chart topper hits by Madonna. I'd recommend this cd to anyone looking for a classic cd necessary for any cd collection. This is possibly Madonna's best album because it pulls together all of her greatest songs. You can listen to her other albums, but this is the only one that combines so many top ten hits of Madonnas of the decade. Everyone should at least listen to this album once and let it bring back memories of the times of side pony tails and spandex that we all remember all so well.  <br />
B0001LJCMK|3.0|Well, I like it because it sounds just like Canned Heat. I swear the lead singer and guitar playing sounds exactly like \\"Blind Owl\\" Alan Wilson from Canned Heat! Same high pitched drawl. Same fuzzy blues guitar sound and style. Same lo-fi basic drum sound too. Just listen to clips of the CD \\"The best of Canned Heat\\" on amazon, specifically these songs:  \\"on the road again\\" and \\"goin up the country\\" ....it's like the same guy and band!  Dirty early electric country blues (also called \\"boogie blues\\") very similar to this stuff. Bottom line is if you like \\"The eagles of...\\" you'll like these late 60's era Canned Heat albums: \\"Canned Heat\\" \\"Boogie with Canned Heat\\" \\"Living the Blues\\" and Hallelujah\\".  Canned Heat is from Southern California too!  So \\"the Eagles of...\\" are good but not original at all...just like Kyuss (sabbath). So I'm kind of sad to see that the trend these days with bands like \\"The eagles of...\\", white stripes, hives, etc seems to be just to copy one certain vintage 60's/70's group verbatim, and today's buyers will think it's completely original because they're too young to have heard the original sources. Will new bands ever be original again? Yes the past is rich with musical inspiration, but it's about time someone takes it to the next level and stops copying.
B000002KKS|5.0|DISCLAIMER I:    No, Ozzy's not on this album. <br />DISCLAIMER II:   Yes, it IS a BLACK SABBATH album! <br />DISCLAIMER III:  It is a BRILLIANT HEAVY METAL ALBUM! <br /> <br />This album is, quite possibly, Black Sabbath's crowning achievement and the crowning achievement for heavy metal as well. <br /> <br />It was an exciting time for heavy metal in general, especially in Britain.  In America, about the closest one got to heavy metal were Van Halen (fresh and exciting), Ted Nugent (on the decline; I like Ted but one can only rewrite \\"Cat Scratch Fever\\" so many times) and Aerosmith (I doubt they even remember this era!), all of whom rejected the title \\"heavy metal\\". <br /> <br />So it was left up to what became known as the New Wave of British Heavy Metal (NWOBHM).  The focus was on new, hungry bands like Motorhead, Saxon, Def Leppard (yes, they were an HM band once!) etc but also revitalised veterans like Judas Priest (who came surging ahead with their monumental \\"British Steel\\" album)....and BLACK SABBATH! <br /> <br />Many had written this band off after increasingly-mediocre albums in the late 1970s, drugs and drink problems and finally the ouster of Ozzy Osbourne, who went on to spend quite a bit of time in LA's Le Parc hotel \\"living\\" on booze, drugs and pizza.  In fact, the band themselves were about to call it a day. <br /> <br />But then, by chance, if chance you call it, the musical blood-pump of Black Sabbath, Tony Iommi, met up with THE VOICE of Rainbow (and earlier Elf), Ronnie James Dio.  Originally this was not to have been a Black Sabbath album (and Ozzy \\"War Pigs\\", \\"Paranoid\\", \\"Iron Man\\" diehards probably wish it wouldn't have been), but when Iommi, Dio, Geezer Butler (who had also briefly left, to be replaced by Dio's former Rainbow mate, the late Craig Gruber) and Bill Ward got together, abetted by Tony's new friend Geoff Nicholls on keyboards, it WAS Black Sabbath.  Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. <br /> <br />Some (including Ozzy) carped that this sounded like a Rainbow album.  Not entirely true, though I could imagine \\"Lonely Is The Word\\" not being out of place on \\"Rainbow Rising\\" or \\"Walk Away\\" on \\"Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow\\".  But it is, unmistakably, a Black Sabbath album. <br /> <br />Tony Iommi was revitalised.  At last he had a vocalist who could sing anything, in any key, and who was an excellent songwriter to boot, taking some of the onus off Geezer's shoulders. <br /> <br />And the songs, along with Martin Birch's near-faultless production, speak for themselves: <br /> <br />\\"Neon Knights\\": A fast, deadly riff rocker and the perfect show-opener for the tours with Dio that would follow. <br /> <br />\\"Children Of The Sea\\": Moody, with a classically-flavoured acoustic guitar intro.  Here Dio laments the fall of the human race, what we do to ourselves, the people around us and the world we live in. <br /> <br />\\"Lady Evil\\": Along with \\"Walk Away,\\" my least favourite track on the album.  However, its excellence is such that a seemingly-derogatory term is irrelevant. <br /> <br />\\"Heaven and Hell\\": The shining jewel in both the crown of Black Sabbath and Ronnie James Dio.  This is the best song the band has ever done.  Excellent lyrics, perfect Sabbath atmosphere, and the band's renowned time changes.  Kind of got butchered in live performances, with a lot of things added that didn't need to be there. <br /> <br />\\"Wishing Well\\": Another solid, fast-paced starter for side two (remember album sides?) of the album.  Excellent.  Listen closely and you'll hear Iommi strumming acoustic guitar behind his rhythm guitar track. <br /> <br />\\"Die Young\\": Moody and excellent.  Geoff Nicholls' simple-but-effective keyboard accompaniment comes to the fore on this one.  Fast, slow, dark, light...all the things a Sabbath song should be. <br /> <br />\\"Walk Away\\": Probably the most \\"commercial\\" track on the album.  Was it meant to be a \\"hit single\\"?  I don't know.  It's not as good as the rest of the album but it's still good. <br /> <br />\\"Lonely Is The Word\\": Starts out with a menacing Iommi riff and cascades through 5.49 of musical brilliance.  Dio may not have quite the \\"despairing\\" voice of Ozzy but he sure does a bloody excellent job of conveying despair here.  Fades out with Iommi firing away on all cylinders over Nicholls' keyboard washes. <br /> <br />This really did open up a new era for the band creatively, though not without problems.  Ward was still having serious drug problems, which led to his departure midway through the tour.  Also, Iommi and Dio began to butt heads.  Sometimes this can make for excellent music (witness The Who) but Dio often failed to remember he was the \\"new guy\\" in Tony Iommi's band.  Also, I remember reading stories in the music press that \\"fans\\" were going to the concerts just to chant \\"Ozzy!\\" and hold up \\"OZZY RULES\\" banners.  Why pay for the ticket if you're just going to a show that you KNOW Ozzy is not performing? <br /> <br />Ozzy-only detractors would do well to remember that voters in \\"Circus\\" magazine's Readers' Poll for 1980 gave Sabbath the award for \\"Comeback Of The Year\\" and that this tour was largely a sellout, even when inexplicably coupled with Blue Oyster Cult (whom I do like). <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the \\"revolving-door\\" of singers and other personnel would soon commence after the equally-strong \\"Mob Rules\\" album. <br /> <br />Put aside your prejudices and treat yourself to this album...personally I can't understand why there are those who will listen to Dio with Rainbow and his own band (and even Elf!) but not with Sabbath.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Before the release of Train of Thought, I had hoped that Dream Theater would record another progressive-metal epic, along the lines of Images and Words, Awake, and Scenes from a Memory.  But instead, Dream Theater has served up a head-banging heavy metal feast, which sounds almost as much like '80s-era Metallica, Megadeth, and Iron Maiden as it does Dream Theater.  And while it's not what I had hoped for or expected, I have to say that it is very, very good.  John Petrucci and Mike Portnoy shine the most on this disc, with Petrucci delivering bone-crunching riffs and lightning-fast solos, and with Portnoy going crazy on the drums (including lots of double bass).  John Myung (bass) also shows some excellent chops on this disc, though Jordan Rudess (keyboards) unfortunately plays a slightly less prominent role this time around.  And James LaBrie does a surprisingly good job with the vocals, considering that his vocal style wouldn't seem to be a natural fit for a metal album in the vein of Metallica and Megadeth.    In addition to being very heavy, the songs on Train of Thought also feature some catchy hooks, something that Dream Theater has sometimes lacked in the past.  Lyrically, Train of Thought is much angrier than most of Dream Theater's previous work, but this attitude matches the music perfectly.  My only complaint is that there is quite a bit of profanity in the lyrics, especially on the track \\"Honor Thy Father.\\"  This bothers me because over the years I have grown used to the idea of Dream Theater taking the high road, so to speak, and not feeling the need to pepper their lyrics with four-letter words.  But this complaint is relatively minor, and it doesn't stand in the way of my enjoying what is destined to be a classic metal album.
B00003CXCT|2.0|Let me state first off that I'm not the most drooling fan of Star Wars in the world. I don't go to SW conventions, I don't dress up in costumes to show my love of the films, and I have never owned a toy light saber. But I do like the original trilogy very much, enough to have bought more than one copy as the years have gone by. I even saw (what I believe was) the first sanctioned screening of the trilogy in Hollywood in 1985, which was an experience I won't forget.    I also consider myself somewhat of a film purist, and honestly I think it's sad to see such a classic series of pop culture films treated in such a cavalier fashion by their creator. Granted, George Lucas made them and he has the full right to do what he pleases with them -- I support the concept of the painter destroying his own paintings if he so chooses. But unfortunately Lucas seems to no longer trust his past work for what it was. His quest for technical and aesthetic continuity between the two trilogies, which is probably foolhardy from the start, seems to be insatiable. Most people agree that these films really didn't need any additional enhancement (or continuity checks) to retain their reputation with audiences old and new. George Lucas is on a slippery slope with his enhancement crusade, and it's becoming increasingly obvious that the Star Wars films will never truly be \\"finished\\" -- just constantly updated and remarketed.    Sadly, this reminds me of the bad old days of the film preservation movement, not so long ago, when Ted Turner thought it was a good idea to colorize classic black-and-white films of the past -- a practice that, thankfully, has not withstood the test of time. Hopefully, neither will this.    Yes, Lucas made the films and he can do what he wants with them. But I don't have to buy it if it's not what I want, either. And neither do you.
B00003CXCT|2.0|This is getting out of hand! I want my original Star Wars, mat pantings and all! I want Boba Fett's real voice, not a bad actors cheasy dub over! I don't want to see a digitized version of Harrison Ford's head dodge a lazer from Greedo's blaster! Hey, why don't we add Jar Jar Binks in the next release, he could be chewbacca's old friend, It would add continuity. What happened to George Lucas, he screwed up Episode 1, Episode 2, and most likely Episode 3, but why did you have to take this from everyone. Sure It's just a view changes, but it's the little things in life MAN! Common, I'm not gonna tell you it wasn't fun watching STAR WARS on DVD! It will always be one of those movies to unique to be qualified a \\"movie\\", well lets hope any way. Prey there are no signifigant Special effects advances within the next 10 years. I'd pay $100 for the original trilogy to be on DVD and so would 1000's of other people. JUST RELEASE THE ORIGINAL PLEASE, FOR THE FANS!
B00003CXCT|1.0|On the heels of George Lucas' controversial decision to edit his star wars movies other film makers are considering making similar changes and the outrage from film purists are just beginning to boil over. Surprisingly, to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Rocky horror picture show next year director Jim Sharman will be releasing a special edition of the cult classic in which new songs will be added to the film and old favorites will be cut out because Sharman doesn't like those songs. Sharman says its his movie and that he has the right to have the songs he wants in the film even if the film has already been out for 30 years.  <br /> <br />After hearing that the Rocky Horror picture show was going to have a special addition Sylvester Stallone thought a Special Rocky should be considered as well. To the surprise of many it appears that Rocky will actually defeat Apollo Creed in the first movie. When asked about the obvious character arc conflict this will create with the rest of the series Stallone was heard to have said he always meant to beat Creed in the first movie but due to time and budget constraints the version with Creed winning had to be used. As for any character arc problems Sly quipped \\"I have no idea what that even means\\" <br /> <br />Perhaps most controversially of all is James Cameron's choice to change the ending of his biggest movie Titanic. Cameron apparently was so overwhelmed by fan reaction to the Rose DeWitt Bukater and Jack Dawson love story that Cameron has decided to \\"give Jack back to the fans\\" and produce an ending where they live happily ever after. The iceberg actually misses Titanic in this version and as the mighty ship sails into New York Harbor Cal Hockley (the fianc of Rose) realizes that Jack and rose were destined to be together and heartily congratulates the happy couple in what insiders say is a most touching scene. Cameron is apparently so taken by this new version that he will soon be sweeping out all other versions ofthis film and is even going so far as to ask people to surrender their old copies of the original film. Cameron is even considering going after a court order to ensure the original film is never shown again anywhere.  <br /> <br />Other classics are sure to undergo the same treatment as time goes on. Rumors are swirling around films like Jaws, The sixth sense, grease and even the Ten Commandments. George Lucas should be proud of himself. The film pioneer has struck new ground yet again. It was sheer genius to edit his films years after their release and fans everywhere can't wait to see where it will all end.

068987474X|3.0|Although I am only 21, I found this book to be extremely helpful....It's funny, honest and makes you want to do two things 1) dump everyone in your life who is not worth your time and 2) tell all your girlfriends that he's just not into her.  Read it ladies, if you're sick of dating shady guys with no spine. You have to adjust it to fit your life, though. If you find the guy that says \\"You're too smart for any book. Let's watch the Cubs game.\\" But doesn't call 5 times a day, and you think he's just not that into you, then you're just not that into yourself. Live it Learn it Love it, then Adjust it.
0156027321|5.0|This story is supposed to make you believe in god.  Looking over the other reviews I see that about half loved it and half hated it.  I loved it, but not for spiritual reasons.  Actually, I found the parts on religion to be the most tiresome.  Didn't change my feelings about god one way or the other.  BUT...it is a thrilling story, with lots to keep me turning pages.  The ending twist (if it can be called that) didn't come as much of a surprise but I don't think it was supposed to.  I enjoyed the insight into the animal behavior and the challenge of matching each episode with its \\"real\\" counterpart.  Some may argue that it is supposed to be ambiguous as to which story is true.  Any book which inspires some to love it and some to hate it can't be bad.
0440238609|5.0|I'm currently an English BA Major, due to graduate in December 2004.  For one of my final literature course requirements, I'm taking a Young Adult literature course, with the goal of studying Young Adult literature as a genre of literature worth study and analysis.  It's also geared towards future English teachers, both to make them familiar with what their students are reading, and acquaint them with how to teach literary theory in secondary school environments.  One of the books we were to read for this course was The Golden Compass.<br /><br />First, I loved the book, and was so spellbound about what was going to happen next, I had to buy the rest of them and read them.  I was astounded by Pullman's tremendous diversity.  While the plot continued through the second and third books, it was as though I was reading a totally different story in each book.  It never got boring, and Pullman has a way of twisting the plot in ways you never expect.  In fact, several times, he literally pulled the ground out from under me.<br /><br />Also, an interesting note for those of you who have studied literature, Pullman deliberately re-creates Milton's \\"Paradise Lost\\" with this series.  Keep that in mind while reading them.<br /><br />P.S. - For all of you older readers out there, and maybe even a few of the younger ones, keep a box of kleenex on hand for the end of the third book.and sexual references are among them.  While that may sound terrible, keep in mind that Pullman does use discretion when describing these things, and often does not go into detail, and many insinuations exist that most children wouldn't catch anyway.   <br /> <br />All in all, I would say that 12 would be a good age to allow your children to start reading these.   <br /> <br />P.S. - For all of you older readers out there, and maybe even a few of the younger ones, keep a box of kleenex on hand for the end of the third book.
0060934719|5.0|Stardust tells the story of people mixing with the fairy world circa 1830's England.  In the village of Wall there is a gate that is guarded and has been guarded continuously for centuries, because the gate is an entrance to the world of Fairy.  Every nine years a fairy market is held on the other side of the gate.  At the begining of Stardust, Dunstan Thorne from the village of Wall falls in love with and sexes a fairy girl.  Nine months later a baby in a basket is pushed through the gate with a nametag labeled Tristan Thorne.<br /><br />Tristan grows up unaware of his parentage.  He and half the village are in love with the very beautiful Victoria Forester.  One night as he walks her home he begs for a kiss.  She refuses.  They see a shooting star and on a whim Victoria promises Tristan any request including marriage if he brings her the fallen star....  which landed on the other side of the wall.  It is clear (to us) that Victoria is only joking with Tristan, but 17 year old Tristan takes the quest very seriously.  So Tristan sets off on his journey into fairy land.<br /><br />Hence flows the rest of the story as Tristan finds the star, which or rather who turns out to be a young looking and ageless woman, and trys to bring her back to Victoria while protecting her from other interested parties with less picturesque plans.<br /><br />Stardust is a cute little fairy story.  Tristan's naievety and kind heart carry him through his brushes with the strange world he finds on the other side of the wall.  Things end happily if not in the way anyone expected.<br /><br />Stardust is a fairy tale for adults, and caters to Gaiman fans.  Some of the characters overlap Sandman and other comic books.  But Stardust takes place in a selfcontained world and the story flows well, so not having read a whole bunch of comics won't keep you from following the story and enjoying it.<br /><br />I recommend Stardust.  It is a sweet little fairy story.

Morgan Freeman & Tim Robbins are stellar.  I've watched this time after time since it was released, and I always catch something new.  I recently visited the Mansfield Reformatory where this movie was filmed, & it was like reliving the entire movie.  Go there if you get a chance. (The Russian prison scenes in Air Force One were filmed there, too.)  The prison is haunting, disturbing, and gets into your gut, just like the movie.

Suffice to say, that if anyone goes to the trouble to rip a 30 year old album, then it must be pretty good.  The world is filled, after all, with things to give a five star review to.  Now I think I'll hustle off and rip the Ramones a new one.  Toodles<br /><br />Baker Street Muse is the Greatest rock song of all time, BTW.

B00005JKC3|5.0|Despite what others may think, I thought this movie was fabulous.  I was really impressed by the story and the direction.  If you did not like this movie, you must not have ever read a Hulk comic.  Many people who were new to comics or went to see it hoping for a green version of Spiderman were probably disappointed.  But guys, this comic is a serious comic about a split-personality anti-hero.  This guy has problems from parental abuse and years of repression.  How more today can you get?  The only problem is the artistic license taken with bioengineering.  However, times change and the movie works.  Who cares if you can tell its CGI?  He's nine feet tall and green.  He throws tanks and runs faster than Comanche helocopters.  Again, I was impressed that they kept the seriousness of the film, yet were able to pull off decent action.  Til the Leader uses Rogaine, make mine the Hulk.

B00028HBKC|4.0|There's so much debate about the violence of this movie that it may scare some from watching it. But Mel Gibson makes it known that he doesn't want to elaborate on the physical suffering of Jesus as much as he wants to elaborate on the courage and strength of Jesus to do God's will. Seeing him tremble and Pray to God made me feel closer to Jesus in that we know what torture and suffering he would face. The fact that we see Jesus as Human in those last hours is what makes the whole Movie moving. There are scenes that will make a person cringe. But the last scene of Jesus resurrection gives hope and almost purges those feelings of despair. This movie depicts true Love and Hope through even the most darkest hours. Other than some rather cheesy scenes and some overdramatic irony the movie should remain a classic for it's indie aspirations and block buster accomplishments. <br />
B00028HBKM|2.0|Mel Gibson's \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" spurred intense interest in America in the spring of 2004. The DVD version can only continue the phenomenon.<br /><br />Based on the visions of Anna Catherine Emmerich, a German nun of the late 17th and early 18th centuries, \\"The Passion\\" fills in the wide narrative gaps in the gospel accounts of Christ's Passion. Emmerich's visions are believed by the very pious to depict, in excruciating and accurate detail, the agonies of Jesus Christ in his last hours. Gibson has stretched and cut Emmerich's visions -- adding an extreme amount of blood, gore and screaming -- to achieve his final effect. Like it or not, this very affecting movie will either awe you (seemingly the majority of viewers) or dismay and upset you (the minority, including this reviewer).<br /><br />The buzz is that this the most authentic depiction of Christ's Passion ever filmed. Actors speak in Latin and Aramaic -- in Gibson's mind, the languages of the time. Neither does Gibson spare the gory details. Roman scourging is said to have been brutal; Gibson shows us each blood-spattering, flesh-rending blow in agonizing detail. The results are visually arresting, serving up searing mental images that will stay with viewers for a lifetime. (PLEASE do not bring kids under 14 to this movie!) Religious authorities have lauded the film. Entire theaters were reserved for church groups. The Holy Father is said to have uttered (falsely, as it turns out) \\"It is as it was.\\"<br /><br />So what's the problem? \\"The Passion\\" is a movie curiously dislocated in time. It bears more resemblance to 19th century Roman Catholic peasant piety than to that of secular 21st century Protestant America. As a middle-aged Roman Catholic, I recall how nuns exaggerated and fetishized the details of Christ's Passion. Gibson does the same, lovingly embracing the wood of the Cross; caressing the nails; cherishing the scourges; singing praises to the crown of thorns. I am also boggled by the film's historical inaccuracies. Greek, not Latin, was the *lingua franca* of the Mediterranean world. Having Christ chat with Pilate in Latin was silly. The inscription on the Cross is rendered in Latin and Aramaic only, omitting Greek, against the evidence of the gospels.

If asked, though, I'd steer people to the gospels instead. Greek, not Latin, was the *lingua franca* of the Mediterranean world. Having Christ chat with Pilate in Latin was silly.

B00005JMX6|4.0|Well, i saw the girl next door in theatres and I have to say that I really liked it. I thought it was funny and enjoyable. When it was released on DVD in an unrated edition i went to blockbuster and rented it to see how much more explicit it was. It turned out that there only is about less than 10 minutes of unrated stuff. All of it involves nudity and actually makes the movie a tad bit better, but no more funnier.  If you saw the original you may or may not like this version, i like the unrated one better but thats just me.  If you havnt seen either of them I would sugust viewing the rated one. Overall the movie is funny, and I liked it. People who like teen sex comedys should enjoy it, everyone else should stay away.
0517201658|5.0|I adore this book, from beginning to end. I never put it down, and have picked it up many times since it's first 'start to finish' read.  <br />It is rare to find a story with every single right element. I do not know where Ms. Mccullough went wrong; I do not believe she did.  <br />I wouldn't change one thing in this sweeping, tragic, powerful love story. <br />
B00003CXCT|5.0|These dvds have everything the original movies had and more. The added special effects don't come anywhere close to the ridiculous prequals, and are just enough to make the movies perfect.  Any fan with a dvd player must have this set!
0767830555|5.0|A film like \\"Taxi Driver\\" could not be made today.  Even in it's day it was highly misunderstood even among it's admirers as an exploitation film.  The first time I saw this film was on a double-bill in 1982 with a repugnant slasher film, \\"Maniac\\".  It's reputation probably wasn't helped because it was the impetus for an assassination attempt on the President.  The seventies saw a lot of daring films greenlighted but even by these permissive standards \\"Taxi Driver\\" must have been a tough sell.  The story centers on the paranoia of a lonely, disengaged taxi driver,Travis Bickle, played by Robert DeNiro who is disgusted with the vice of his chosen city, New York.  He may be more dangerous than the vermin he dispises.  When his feeble attempts to connect with other people are rebuffed he falls back on the only way he knows, violence.  He also elevates himself in his mind as some kind of avenging angel.  He takes it upon himself to be the protector of a 13 year-old prostitute, whether she wants to be saved or not.  It goes without saying that DeNiro gives a commanding and daring performance here.  It was his first starring role in a major film and he makes an impression.  He is ably supported by a supporting cast that includes Harvey Keitel as a pimp, Cybil Shepherd as a pretty campaign worker who rebuffs Travis after he takes her to a porn film, and a young Jodie Foster as the prostitute.  Director Martin Scorsese does a superior job from an excellent script from Paul Schrader.  This was Schrader's first script that was produced and he has never surpassed \\"Taxi Driver\\" with any subsequent screenplays.  The cinematography by Michael Chapman is excellent, a kind of hazy picture of vice-ridden New York before it was cleaned up.  Enough cannot be said about the jazzy score by Bernard Herrmann that heightens whatever mood is being conveyed.  This DVD contains an excellent documentary, but no commentary by Scorsese.  On a final note, is the last scene reality or a dream?  Does Betsey(Shepherd) really get in Travis' taxi or is it something he just imagines like so many other things?
B0002OERI0|5.0|Potrait of the young American 2004. A snapshot in time. War in the background. A confusing election. An even blurrier future. All coexisting with internal emotional struggles and a love story which never happens.  <br /> <br />Yup, this about sums it up for me right now.
B000055Y0X|5.0|This film is one of the few where a star rating does it no justice.  Praise for this film is infinite.  This ranks as one of the great acts of chutzpah in American film-making.  Imagine this:  A dark comedy about a renegade general unleashing nuclear terror released on the heels of the Cuban missile crisis.  Kubrick and his collaborators(that include author Terry Southern) knew something that more serious films (i.e Stanley Kramer's \\"Fail-Safe\\") didn't.  They knew that a more effective way to educate the public to the dangers of nuclear proliferation is to emphasize the insanity of it all.  Kubrick assembled a first-rate cast to convey this message.  Peter Sellers plays three roles superbly: the rationale yet panicky President of the U.S., a British group captain attached to the general who unleashes the nuclear attacks, and the titular character, Dr. Strangelove, a wheelchair bound German nuclear scientist whose arm involuntarily goes into a Nazi salute.  George C. Scott is superb as General Turgidson who seems more concerned with beating the \\"Russkies\\" with their pants down than averting doomsday.  Sterling Hayden is effectively psychotic as General Ripper whose obsession with fluordation sets these events in motion.  Slim Pickens is hilarious as the cowboy Major Kong whose sense of duty is admirable to a fault.  Interestingly, this role was originally supposed to be played by Sellers but he did not feel he could do justice to it.  Good call, Peter.  In smaller roles Peter Bull, Keenan Wynn, and James Earl Jones do admirable jobs.  As usual, Kubrick's ingenious use of existing music(instead of an original score) is impeccable.  The sets service the film well, particularly the war room with the big board.  \\"Dr Strangelove\\" is not just a great comedy but a landmark in film history.  The DVD contains a decent documentary, considering that most Kubrick discs skimp or are bereft of any extras.
B00005JLT5|5.0|To all the people who have been saying that Jews were cowards for just letting brutalities happen to them, might I say how hard it is to fight people with automatic weapons with just your fists? They had no weapons, no training, aand the SS had guns, muscle, and cruelty. Frankly the negative reviwers are quite brutal in their treatment of Szpilman for what? Surviving.  He was given a chance to survive, and took it.  What would you do?  This film accurately portrays what it took to survive in the midst of an Anti-Semetic area, dogged by the slime of human creation.  <br /> <br />These negative reviewers seem to think the only way to be a hero is to charge out into battle, with plenty of food, ammunition and a high chance of survival.  Szpilman was hanging on for his life in the Warsaw, committing acts of bravery no one considered. I find it heroic that this man had the willpower to survive on the meager rations that he did.   <br /> <br />To that reviewer who seems to think that Sept. 11(3,000+) was a greater tragedy than the holocaust(13,000,000+), I find it odd that you find it more brave to wrestle with a man with a box knife than to mount a hopeless fight against trained soldiers armed with tanks, flamethowers, SMG's, and so on with nothing but a handful of rifles and pistols you could smuggle in. <br /> <br />Brody did truly an amazing job at bring Szpilman to life.  His face is perfect for it, and he was brilliant in making us feel the weakness we feel when your world is collapsing before your eyes.  I was nearly moved to tears when that German officer allowed him to live.  That act and others, such as Schindler, brought redemption to the German people.  As a teacher, I would reccomend at least showing the parts in the ghetto to any class studying the holocaust.  It truly brings out the horror of the ghetto. <br /> <br />To Szpilman, the survivors of the Holocaust, and all those Canadians whose flawed DVDs kept them from enjoying this masterpiece.  May you oneday find a DVD that contains all the Special features you need.
B00000G3AZ|4.0|One of the wonderful things about Jane Austen's stories is that the same set of circumstances - a young woman's coming of age and falling in love - are examined from many different angles. In Emma, the central character is something of a snob. Delightful in her character, she never the less considers herself above just about every one of her acquaintances in some way.     Emma determines, therefore, to play matchmaker. When she meets the lovable - if not extremely intelligent - Miss Smith, Emma is determined to marry her off to one of the upper class gentlemen in the neighborhood.    This is lovely adaptation of Jane Austen's novel. The story remains faithful to the work and the cast is wonderfully chosen (specifically Toni Collette as Miss Smith).    There are several things about the movie that prevent it from being better. First, there is a series of scene changes that take place in mid-sentence. This is cleverly done. In setting up the next scene, the characters suddenly find themselves in it. After a while, though, the rapid scene changes gave me a feeling akin to very slight motion sickness. I think the trick was maybe used just a little too often. Second, the choreography of the ball is horrid, or at least the dancing is. I can't speak to its authenticity, but it seemed to me as if the choreographer had quit half way through. Third and lastly, the language of the film has been updated too much. While I'm sure this makes the film more accessible, I love Jane Austen's dialogue too much to enjoy seeing it pulled too far from the original (\\"Clueless\\" exists as a great modernization of the story - with some fairly major modifications of the plot).    All in all, \\"Emma\\" is almost enjoyable in movie format as the novel. Toni Collette's portrayal of Miss Smith had me laughing out loud on several occasions, and particularly in her interactions with Paltrow. Likewise, Alan Cumming did a marvelous job as Mr. Elton, only to be outdone by Juliet Stevenson as his wife.I haven't paid any attention to the extras on the DVD, so I can't speak to those. I only know I found the film itself well worth the investment, as I've watched it several times and will definitely continue to do so.
B00005QIPH|5.0|The Strokes have been the subject of much debate in the past few years since the release of Is This It, their first album.  Although they were praised with almost unanimous critical acclaim they received a mixed reaction from the general public.  Perhaps this happened because of the masses' conditioning to like terrible bands such as Creed but whatever the case, its their loss for missing out on this due to their brainwashed narrow mindedness.  No, The Strokes aren't the second coming of Christ, but they are a great rock 'n' roll band that knows how to pay homage to their forefathers musically.  The Strokes' sound is very similar to what is found on The Velvet Underground's classic \\"I'm Waiting For The Man\\" using a very simple, churning chord structure that is so rarely found in this day and age.  It is this, along with Julian Casablanca's emotional sing/speak vocals, that makes The Strokes such a stand out band.  To compliment their old is new again sound, they have a great collection of songs here with maybe one or two missing the mark ever so slightly.  Is This It is a most enjoyable experience for educated music lovers everywhere and with the success of their second CD, it seems The Strokes will not be forgotten any time soon.

B00004Y6NP|5.0|I'm into metal (Slipknot,Rammstein, Cradle of Filth etc.) but I have to represent the year I was born (1985) with the greatest cd of that year, Brothers in Arms. Mark Knopfler is one of the greatest guitarist/vocalist of all time. He has a great voice and he is an awesome guitar player (proof in Money for Nothing). Like everyone else, my favorite song from the cd has got to be \\"Money For Nothing\\", it's 8 1/2 minutes of brilliance. They couldnt of made that song more perfect. My other favorites on this cd are: \\"So Far Away\\", \\"Walk Of Life\\", and \\"Your Latest Trick\\". Recommended to all!!!!
B0000E1WKE|1.0|I really wanted to like this album. As a collector of Christmas music and one who has always appreciated the talent of Whitney Houston, I waited impatiently for a Whitney Christmas album. Unfortunately, I didn't feel like I got either one. <br /> <br />This is the first inferior album that has had Whitney Houston's name attached to it. The main reason that it falls short is because of Whitney's loss of vocal range. In the past few years, her voice has gone downhill steadily, and it is no more apparent than on these Christmas songs. Even when she hits the high notes, she is struggling. Gone is the effortless vocal soar that she mastered so many years ago. My suggestion to Ms. Houston is to take a few years off, to stop touring, to regain her vocal majesty and then make a comeback album that will knock everyone else's socks off. <br /> <br />Secondly, the album's arrangements are boring and are not Christmasy at all. The \\"Deck the Halls/Silent Night\\" arrangement is interesting to say the least, but it's anything but \\"silent.\\" The words don't match the music. \\"Little Drummer Boy\\" is a highlight, due to the appearance of Whitney's daughter and an interesting mix. Still, apart from \\"Drummer Boy\\" and the two last songs (which were included on \\"The Preacher's Wife\\"), there are no other highlights. <br /> <br />Another complaint is that the album tries to be all things to all people. And it winds up not being anything to anybody. Have we really gotten to the point where even Christmas has to be politically correct? At the end of \\"The Christmas Song,\\" Whitney wishes everyone a Happy Hannukah, a Happy Kwanza, and a Merry Christmas. With no disrespect intended, it sounds silly. And if that isn't bad enough, Whitney's grammar is wrong on several occasions as well, especially when she says \\"reindeers.\\" <br /> <br />Overall, the album suffers from lack of direction, lack of good material, and a faltering superstar. Whitney, you've got a fantastic voice. Recover it, rest a while,and then come back and make a real Christmas album. God bless!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|In contrast to the Star Trek and Star Wars visions of a galaxy full of aliens, Firefly explores another possible vision of humanity's future.  The only thing in outer space is what we take with us - including our past.  With art, emotion, and sophistication, Joss delivers an introspective, engaging, and entertaining television series that suffered a too-early demise. <br /> <br />I highly recommended it to anyone interested in seeing fresh science fiction!
0156012197|5.0|This is a children's book?<br /><br /> Perhaps.  Maybe, as Saint Exupery implies, adults are too sophisticated, too wise, too adult, to understand the eloquent common sense about living a rational life.  It takes some thought, insight and reason to comprehend the innate meaning.  It's the ultimate 'take time to stop and smell the roses\\" book, which brings to mind an anecdote from 'Art and Fear' by David Batles and Ted Orland, quoting Howard Ikemoto:<br /><br /> \\"When my daughter was about seven years old, she asked me one day what I did at work.  I told her I worked at the college  --  that my job was to teach people how to draw.<br /><br /> \\"She stared back at me, incredulous, and said, 'You mean they forget?'\\"<br /><br /> The Little Prince is just as incredulous about many attitudes he encounters on Earth;  on his travels, he keeps meeting adults who are wrapped up in their self-importance and egos.  Surely, Saint Exupery understood the difference;  his dedication was to \\"Leon Werth\\" in 1943 France, which he \\"corrected\\" to read, \\"To Leon Werth when he was a little boy.\\"<br /><br /> It's a book of wonderful important things which children understand  (it made me appreciate once again the importance of rotten crab apples)  but which we set aside as adults.  Children will understand it instinctively in their hearts  . . . . .  think of reading a few pages every night as a child falls asleep.  Adults will love the allegories, and it will truly bring back memories of their own rag doll, or blankie (to use a term from Peanuts), or worn baseball glove, or even their own squishy soft rotten apples.<br /><br /> As adults, we are all familiar with advertising;  but, how manjy of us realize that advertising is lies  --  not in an absolute literal sense  --  but because it emphasizes terrible destructive myths and untruths to us (Do things really go better with Coke?)<br /><br /> Written in 1943, when Adolf Hitler dominated much of Europe, the Little Prince meets an \\"absolute monarch\\" who tells him, \\"Accepted authority rests first of all on reason.  If you ordered your people to go throw themselves into the sea, they would rise up in revolution.\\"  In other words, absolute authority depends on being reasonable;  unreasonable orders reflect a failure of the person giving the order, not a fault of anyone unable to carry out such an order.<br /><br /> \\"When one wishes to play the wit, he sometimes wanders a litte from the truth,\\" Saint Exupery writes.  Balance that with an observation by Pablo Picasso, \\"Computers are useless  --  all they can give you are answers.\\"<br /><br /> In a world jammed with billions of facts and little or no understanding, this book is a reminder that a full and complete life is more than \\"the bottom line\\" of anything.  Had I read it as a little boy, I don't think I'd have understood its wisdom;  had I read it as an young adult, I don't think I'd have understood its wisdom;  having at last read it, I hope I'm not to late to understand its wisdom.ts an \\"absolute monarch\\" who tells him, \\"Accepted authority rests first of all on reason.

B00004WLXZ|5.0|This picture goes to show what you can acomplish when you get people into the right state of mind. Give them jobs, give them a real leader, abolish class structures and give them hope. Watching the young men in this film gives me envy as no leader around the world today can do the same. A pity Hitler and the party turned out to be such war mongers as they created something missing from current day Earth. <br /> <br />The film is excellent as a historical piece. If your looking for an explaination why the whole of Germany followed Hitler like sheep then this movie is for you. Also would recommend watching \\"The Fog of War\\", then you can decide who the bigger criminals were in WW2.
6305127646|5.0|I love this movie! It truly has something for everyone. It's an action adventure, a suspenseful thriller, a love story, a comedy, and a moving drama.  Val Kilmer is sensational, and Elizabeth Shue does a superb job at playing a scientist who is confident about her research but touchingly unsure of herself in other areas of life.  ALL the characters are so well cast, it makes every minute of this movie fun to watch. From the police detectives in Scotland Yard, to the underground art dealer, the Russian president, the prostitute, and, of course, \\"Trejiak's goons\\", among many others.  And the chemistry between Val Kilmer and Elizabeth Shue is believable and sweet.  What's great about this movie is that it's perfect for viewing with one special person, by yourself, or with a group of friends.  Don't miss it.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Tim Burton has created another whimsical masterpiece, this time with a much lighter tone.  His use of dazzeling colors and images enhance an engaging story about a father and son discovering themselves and each other.  I would thoroughly recomend this to anyone. <br />  <br />ret27
B000002UVZ|4.0|REM continue to rock on in their new rock groove in this album release. It's a enjoyable CD to listen to with great sounding songs and neat beats. Much has been said that I agree with in the other reviews. I quite enjoyed two songs in particular in this release and these were; Cuyahoga and What If we give it Away.<br /><br />Any REM fan will not have a problem with this album and should enjoy the songs.
B00005JMUA|5.0|I thought that the Kill Bill Series was excellent. I love Tarantino and thought both movies were great and unique. Although they are essentially about the same thing, the tone of the first movie is very different from Vol. 2. You have to see them both to really appreciate the art Tarantino weaves. To anyone who dislikes these movies and Tarantino as a director, all I can say is maybe you're not really watching. People wait for things to happen instead of just watching and letting the story take you into it's world.
B000069AUI|5.0|f**kin brilliant. that's all i have to say.
B0001CNRSO|4.0|It is a cute movie about an aspiring dance teacher (Alba) who helps keep kids off the streets and out of trouble. It is a movie worth seeing, but if you are not into the whole dance thing it may not be for you!!  But all in all it was pretty good movie!
B000002TQV|5.0|this has to be one of the most brilliant pieces of music ever put together. sheer genius. utterly powerful, moving, and reflective.
B000063JDE|5.0|I didn't read all the customer reviews, but I scanned about 50 of them and the featured review, and did not see one mention of the fact that Frank Booth is a very very funny character. Even Kyle MacLachlan, in an interview on the DVD version, said that he was supposed to be scared but found Dennis Hopper too funny to be afraid.<br /><br />I sample:<br /><br />Ben: 'Here's to your health.'<br /><br />Frank: 'No. Let's toast to something else. Let's toast to f***ing...Say: here's to your f**k, Frank;'<br /><br />Ben: 'Very well, then. Here's to your f**k, Frank...Cheers!'<br /><br />Frank: 'God damn, you're one suave f**k.'<br /><br />terrifying? oedipal? haunting? NO!!...Funny!!!<br /><br />This movie would be terrible without Dennis Hopper as Frank Booth. Jeffrey is pretty cool, and Ben is awesome for a few moments, but, that's it. There's nothing else.<br /><br />Best of all, Dennis Hopper spent years trying to distance himself from this role, giving all the credit to David Lynch, not wanting to be seen as such a depraved maniac by all the frat houses and elsewhere that love Frank Booth so much.<br /><br />See this movie to see Dennis Hopper as Frank Booth. Skip the rest.

6301792734|5.0|People say Garry why cant people find the original theatrical release  of THE STAR WARS TRILOGY Well you can, you really can, and always could, but why would you want to. The people who saw those movies are very special and would never even consider talking about it. Just like the first generation mazda rx7, from 1979 to 1985 Mazda is never going to bring those cars back never. The owners might go electric, they might go solar, but they will never sell.
0375758992|5.0|Yes it's about a family tragedy set within an awful war, but unlike some books that grind on and on with sadness and despair there is none of that here.  I was riveted by the author's gritty, honest, down to earth style, and how she made that convincing even from the viewpoint of a child. At the worst moments of the story it was not helplessness, but pluck, determination and human dignity that reverberated through the words.  The author is a survivor not a victim. The end of the book came far too soon... I was left wanting the rest of the story.  And I was left with one feeling-hope. <br />
B000084T18|3.0|50 Cent isn't a good rapper.  Being shot in the mouth might've cursed 50 more than the other eight shots did.  Sometimes it's hard to understand him, as he mumbles throughout the CD.  None the less, this is a pretty decent album.  I'm diggin \\"Many Men\\".  It has a hot beat and some pretty good lyrics.  50 does have a talent for making impressive choruses.  \\"High All The Time\\" is also an impressive song, mainly because of the beat.  It starts loud, and then goes very plain and simple.  50 also tells a good story in this song that really isn't even about getting high.   <br /> <br />Basically, 50 is now a mainstream artist.  Any so-called street rapper that shouts \\"f*ck the hood\\" in a song is no longer a street rapper.   <br /> <br />But this is a pretty decent album considering all the other crap that comes out now and days.
B00000DLV1|5.0|Often live albums aren't very good, especially if you're not a fan of the songs already.  Often these live albums are just a different take on the original song but I can say without a doubt these live versions are better and more impressive than the originally producted songs.<br /><br />The real orchestra is very impressive and I was surprised how well they pulled off the dark sound.  The only thing I don't like is the guy scratching records is really annoying on the first track.  He does pointless playing with the vinyl like extremely fine scratching that will almost wake you wonder if it's the sound of a damanged tape.  Fortunetly the DJ doesn't scratch too much but when he does, he often distracts from the awesomeness of these songs.<br /><br />1.

B00000269M|4.0|This 1986 effort is probably the last really good album by Jackson, coming after the classics \\"Off the Wall\\" (1979) and \\"Thriller\\" (1982), and preceding the mixed and sometimes forgettable new songs on \\"Dangerous\\" (1991) and  \\"HIStory\\" (1995).  You can still take him seriously as a singer/writer here, before he was mired in self-parody, a semi-martyr pose, and some serious involvement with the DA's office.  He still made some good songs after this, but the bulk of the post-\\"BAD\\" material is-on the whole-not as skilled or inventive as what went on before.<br /><br />The title track sounds like it's right off the \\"Thriller\\" album with its tough guy stance, big THOMPing bass line, and buyer-friendly hooks. Like \\"Thriller,\\" it also features a big name-soloist: the legendary Jimmy Smith on the Hammond organ. Jackson's singing is compelling and the chorus fills in nicely.  \\"The Way You Make Me Feel\\" is embellished with too many Jacksonism's: \\"Hee-hee! Ooh! Go on girl! Aaow\\" (these are actually printed on the included lyric sheet), and is a bit too slow, but it benefits from Jackson's biting vocal tone, and an excellent arrangement.  In contrast, \\"Liberian Girl\\"  needed a better arrangement.  It's too Western for its theme and pose, full of conventional harmony, yet more synthesizers, and no African instrumentation. The next cut, \\"Just Good Friends\\" has too-cute lyrics, and Jackson and Stevie Wonder sound like they're stretching themselves in this ultimately tedious cut.<br /><br />Still, the next few songs are generally excellent. \\"Another Part of Me\\" has the rhythm and strength of \\"Bad,\\" adding more needed funk just in time. \\"Man in the Middle\\" is hard to listen to today without bias. The semi-religious tone and lyrics, the plea for self-improvement and responsibility, the Andrae Crouch Choir even, seem out of place with the Jackson making the news these days. However, when this was released, Jackson was a more credible spokesperson, an icon--to some, an inspiration.  It's a great vocal performance and he pulls off the melodramatics.  \\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\\" features a beautiful melody and a emotional no-frills vocal.  He lets the song do more of the work rather than calling too much attention to himself.  It has the simple beauty and drama of some of his \\"Off the Wall\\" work.  In contrast, Jackson's attempt at hard-rock \\"Dirty Diana,\\" is pretentious, derivative, and messy.  \\"Smooth Criminal,\\" is in \\"Thriller\\"-style, with a heavy beat and Jackson cutting through with an edgy vocal.  The lyrics are nonsense, but the energy, and the tension of the melody give this a classic Jackson feeling.  Again, current events give this a slightly unsettling feeling.  The closer is ok, but not memorable.<br /><br />In 1986, we could look past Jackson's sometimes excessive and egocentric style because his abundant talent was still fresh, and his very best work only a few years old.

It's easy, however, to forget Jackson's enormous contributions, and the context in which he rose to fame.

Whatever else happens to the apparently (and sometimes admittedly) troubled Jackson, he remains one of the most important figures in pop/rock music. Much of that talent is evident on this album..  It's a great vocal performance and he pulls off the melodramatics.  \\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\\" features a beautiful melody and a emotional no-frills vocal.  He lets the song do more of the work rather than calling too much attention to himself.  It has the simple beauty and drama of some of his \\"Off the Wall\\" work.

B000001FI7|5.0|Portishead really invented good trip hop, slow and dark with outstanding lyrics and lots of mood.

0425173755|4.0|Possibly one of the most famous (possibly due to the fine movie of the same title) in the Hercule Poirot series, this classic little mystery has survived since its first publication in 1933 -- maybe that says it all!  The plot is fairly familiar -- during the night on a several day train trip across lower Europe, Poirot's seemingly unpopular sleeping car neighbor is murdered.  Rather than little or no clues or suspects, almost everybody aboard the train is a suspect; plenty of clues float around besides.  Since the train is totally stalled due to a heavy snow, no resources other than sheer brainpower are available to our intellectual Belgian sleuth.  Poirot gets by without his familiar sidekick, Capt. Hastings, but \\"adopts\\" a railroad executive and the traveling doctor as foils upon which to foist his evolving theories.  After Poirot very cleverly determines that the victim is a hated child kidnapper/killer from America, the plot thickens as the interrogations proceed -- first one and then another and then another of the passengers seem to be related somehow to that long ago famous case.  Could it be a conspiracy?  You'll be turning the 200 pages rapidly to find out!<br /><br />As usual, Christie's \\"economy\\" of words dwells on little but the straightforward story telling, but we're soon cast under her spell.  Like most of her stories, there are more than ample pointers for we readers to take a decent stab at the solution ourselves, but we suspect it will be a rare person who beats Poirot to the task!  The book concludes with an unexpected conspiracy of another sort -- will a murderer be tried and convicted or will justice prevail through some other method?  Try this entertaining story for a wonderful, perplexing, and charming whodunit !!

B000255LNE|3.0|It is just so hard to imagine that when it really comes to Greatest Love Songs records these days, there really can be a plus, and there happens to be some minuses in a lot of them. Of course none of them are really perfect. There are some good ones that came out in the past few years from Vanessa Williams, and Patti LaBelle. Nevertheless, Phil Collins has had somegreat Pop songs that he conjured as a middle of the road vocalist. His songs are just truly definitive gems that brought delight into so many people. Unfortunately, his love songs album is just the middle of the road as well.<br /><br />Love Songs: A Compilation Old & New, is a double album reflecting Phil's sincere feeling for love songs. The 25 songs on the album does have some good sides, but does seem to be a miss for most die hard Phil Collins fans. There are some great gems here such as One More Night, A Groovy Kind Of Love, Against All Odds, Two Hearts, and his Oscar-winning song You'll Be In My Heart from Tarzan. There also are a few soulful songs here that were overshadowed and overlooked that could've been included from Phil collins 1998 Hits album that are on this record as well, like Everyday, Do You Remember?, and It's In Your Eyes. The album also includes some live versions of songs Phil recorded that were just delightful like a elegantly recorded Seperate Lives, and a wonderful acapella version of True Colors.<br /><br />Even though the songs are great on this album, there also are some disadvantages with this record. One of them, is that several Collins songs were not included on this record like All Of My Life, Look Through My Eyes from the Disney film, Brother Bear, and surprisingly, his remake of The Supremes You Can't Hurry Love, was also not included on this record. Another problem, is that the album overlooks songs that Phil recorded as a part of Genesis that also were great love songs like Hold On My Heart, In Too Deep, Never A Time, and many other songs. A third problem, is that the record is relatively short, and could've included some more songs than just the twenty-five tracks for this record.<br /><br />For newcomers to Phil Collins music, this is a respectful addition to your library. Unfortunately, most die hard Phil Collins fans might consider passing this record up, and consider a future Greatest Hits collection instead. Still, Phil Collins does make some great songs, and this album does showcase itself fairly well.<br /><br />Overall Rating:  C+the record is relatively short, and could've included some more songs than just the twenty-five tracks for this record.  <br /> <br />For newcomers to Phil Collins music, this is a respectful addition to your library.

055357342X|5.0|I'll keep this short and sweet: Take everything you know about formulaic fantasy writing and throw it out the window. In his remarkable series of books, A Song of Ice and Fire, George R.R. Martin breaks all the rules of the genre' and has created perhaps the best epic fantasy series of all time!<br /><br />There is nothing predictable about this story; nothing that you may have read before prepares you for the scale and originality of Martin's vision. The characters don't follow the tired, hackneyed paths found in countless other fantasy novels, and I guarantee that you'll be genuinely surprised at least a dozen times while reading these books.<br /><br />The First two books in the series primarily followed the destinies of the Stark family throughout the Seven Kingdoms. In this third book you will discover many new and startling revelations about this family which will rock you to the core and forever change your expectations. The pernicious Lannisters also come into sharper focus, again shifting your perceptions and feelings towards them.<br /><br />Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of this book is the ever evolving side story of Daenerys, surely major foreshadowing here of books yet to be written! And unlike other writers, (Robert Jordan jumps to mind) you can be sure that something is really going to happen, and soon.<br /><br />Each chapter in this third book is a delight to read, and every turn of the page brings a new revelation. I've enjoyed all these books enormously; indeed I'll go so far as to say they are the best books I've read in 15 years or more! EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT!!!
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|Nevermind the fact that they are named after a grand duke this band is great! Every song in the Cd is catchy and will surely make you want to get up and dance. The first song \\"jacqueline\\" draws you into what the rest of the Cd is going to be like, \\"tell her ronight\\" a great 60s sounding song and then the famous stomper \\"take me out\\" followed by the dynamic \\"dark of the matinee.\\" The album continues with \\"Auf Asche\\" with cheap synths that make the tone of the song more powerful, then the dance song \\"cheating on you.\\" Later on is the best song on the cd the spectacular \\"michael\\" that is incredibly catchy and very erotic no matter what sexual orientation you are. The only slightly less satisfactory songs on the Cd are \\"darts of pleasure\\" only because the lyrics are lacking, as it goes \\"you can't feel my lips undress your eyes\\" trying to be mysterious but doesnt work, and then \\"40'\\" which is somewhat lack luster. All in all the Cd is a great start for a very talented band, a must have!
B00005JNEI|5.0|This is a must see movie for all Americans! You may not agree with Moore's conclusions - that the war in Iraq was for oil - but the facts he presents are UNDESPUTABLE! For the Bush zealots out there this movie is obviously hard for them to grasp but for people with brains it is easy to follow. After seeing this movie it is easy to see why people are mad at Bush for deceiving them. It's too bad the small minded people who hate this movie cannot refute the facts Moore presents in the movie. Bottom line: Put up or Shut up. Moore did.
B0000019PA|5.0|This is truly worth every penny! Jeff Mangum writes his best work ever, every song is spectacular. Though the CD may take a few people a while to get used to because of the wierdness of the lyrics, and jeff's passion in his singing. But if you are already a NMH fan or an E6 faithful this album is a must, the best band E6 has to offer. Highlights of the CD are: the first song \\"king of carrot flowers pt1\\", the title track, and \\"holand 1945\\", the CD is a great mix with folk and indie rock and psychodelia.
B00E9PMMX0|1.0|All I want is the remastered version I saw in the theater.  That's it.  If I have to take the films from the 70s I'll do that.  I just don't want the plot holes added in and the character changes.  I'm sick of having to buy these dvds, rip and edit them just to get that frikkin story I saw in the theater.  Whyyyyyy!!!!
B0000025RI|4.0|This did not live up to \\"Off The Wall' standards, but it is one of my favorite albums of all time. The tracks \\"Thriller\\", \\"Billie Jean\\", \\"Beat It\\", \\"Human Nature\\", \\"P.Y.T.\\", and \\"The Lady In My Life\\" are all my favorite cuts on this album. No wonder this is the highest selling album of all time.
0140042520|5.0|<br /> <br />If you found \\"On The Road\\" left you desperate for more of Kerouac's energetic prose, then this is perhaps the best next step. It is a lot more reflective, and this, combined with Kerouac's trademarked humble narrator allows real engagment with a book that deals with something worth writing about. It deals with mountain climbing, outdoor parties, groovy beat people and all the other unattainable, idealistic Kerouac things, but this is laced with fragments of Bhuddism, in the attitudes of the characters, their reflection in the freedom of the mountain experience, and the general escapism that provides so much of Bhuddism's popular appeal - it a sort of diet \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintainance\\". It's really good - I'm sure you'll enjoy it. It's also less \\"experimental\\" in literary terms, meaning here Kerouac is simply conveying a story without trying to re-invent the wheel. In many ways, this is a good introduction to Kerouac. The language is simple; it's also technically a much simpler novel than say \\"The Subterraneans\\" or \\"Dr. Sax,\\" even \\"On the Road.\\" Kerouac is not pushing the envelope of invention, here. But with all that I must say it's a wonderful book; it's also (dare I say) Kerouac's most \\"innocent\\" and sweetest book. There's a disarming earnestness and youthfulness at play in \\"Dharma Bums,\\" which reminds of a recent Amazon pick I enjoyed \\"The Losers Club\\" by Richard Perez. In any event, don't miss this great book!
B00005QGAT|5.0|People talk all the time about how great an album \\"Thriller\\" was. Yet, they seem to either neglect or forget that album was marketed to death. This is, without a doubt, Michael Jackson's best album. One of the few albums you could listen to from beginning to end, it was his first solo album, and of course, a timeless classic.<br /><br />1. \\"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough\\" - 10/10. One of the most widely known Michael Jackson hits. Quincy Jones did a great job in producing this beauty, one which still gets plenty of play today.<br /><br />2. \\"Rock With You\\" - 10/10. Another classic. Disco with a touch of love mixed in.<br /><br />3. \\"Workin Day And Night\\" - 7/10. Very fast, upbeat track. One that's sure to get your feet going.<br /><br />4. \\"Get On The Floor\\" - 8/10. Pure disco feel that almost has that \\"Saturday Night Fever\\" feel to it.<br /><br />5. \\"Off The Wall\\" - 6/10. Another decent track. One that would seem somewhat out of style if it wasn;t so good.<br /><br />6. \\"Girlfriend\\" - 10/10. Awesome track. One of the better songs he's made.<br /><br />7. \\"She's Out Of My Life\\" - 10/10. A gem. Michael sings about a girl that he lost due to his being cavalier. You can hear his pain in the lyrics.<br /><br />8. \\"I Can't Help It\\" - 10/10. My favorite Michael Jackson song of all time. One listen and you will notice how smooth it is. When I first heard this, it put me in a trance. A definite must-hear.
B00005JNEI|1.0|Michael Moore holds himself up as a paragon of truth, but there are known lies in this movie that film-goers should be aware of going in.  They have been well documented and broadcast.<br /><br />This movie is brought to you by the same Anti-Bush folks who sponsor CBS/Dan Rather hate and bias. People who have taught us time and again it is OK to forge documents and edit film events no matter what the FACTS are. Contrary to Moore's belief system, things were not all kite-flying and wonderful with Saddam Hussein.  Check out the book SADDAM: KING OF TERROR by Con Coughlin for a reality check.  Coughlin did his research on Saddam Hussein before the war.<br /><br />Michael Moore is a lying hate-monger.  Don't let him polute your mind.
B000002H2H|5.0|1. Fight Fire With Fire (4:44) 10/10 <br /> <br />Do not let the opening 41 seconds of acoustic intro deceive you, the opening track is one of the heaviest songs in Metallica's whole repertoire. As soon as the classic melodies fade, a set of the most menacing, vicious and ruthless riffs slams in your face and shows no mercy. Hetfield's harsh, monotone growls fit the music perfectly and immediately, Metallica exemplifies itself as a force of devastation that cannot be stopped. There is a decent solo section in the middle of the song from 2:34-3:22 that is also worth mentioning. But make no mistake, FFWF sets the stage for the rest of the album flawlessly and provides us a mere taste of what's yet to come.   <br /> <br />2. Ride The Lightning (6:36) 10/10 <br /> <br />The title track, which has Dave Mustaine written all over it throughout the entire span of 6 minutes and 36 seconds is one of the most underrated songs of all time. Again, just 12 seconds in, we are introduced with riffs so intense, it will cause every metal fan to spontaneously snap their necks upon a listen. Hetfield's shrieking vocals does a fantastic job at setting the atmosphere here, shown best by the infamous line \\"I DON'T WANT TO DIIEEE!\\" quickly accompanied by that fierce echo immediately following through. However, the highlight of the song is undisputedly the 1 minute and 33 seconds of furious guitar shredding from Mustaine. The solo commences at the 2:48 mark and gradually builds a cresendo of sonic immensity up until 3:42, when all hell suddenly breaks loose. The tempo then speeds up greatly and Mustaine pulls off some of the most jaw dropping guitar harmonies into the latter half of the solo.  <br /> <br />3. For Whom The Bell Tolls (5:10) 9/10 <br /> <br />Enter thunder and lightning. FWTBT has the longest intro of any track in the history of Metallica's discography. Nothing too fancy, but it does a great job setting the atmosphere and mood for the rest of the song. The vocals here are done incredibly well, arguably Hetfield's best performance on the record. There are also some short moments of intervals between the verses, allowing Ulrich to capitalize on a few drum rolls in order to satisfy his gluttonous ego. The outro seems to drag for a bit, but nevertheless, this is one of the band's most memorable songs and a favorite live.   <br /> <br />4. Fade To Black (6:56) 10/10 <br /> <br />Alas, Fade To Black, probably the best post-Mustaine Metallica song of all time. From start to finish, everything here just thrives. 20 years later, it's still hard to fathom how the band managed to have the classic acoustic notes accompanied so well with the smooth guitar melodies of Hammett in that intro. If you are not moved by the powerful vocals of Hetfield, you will be by the dark, genuine emotion of that main riff. However, the spotlight here is without a doubt on Hammett; for the solo in the instrumental outro would be the best piece of music he ever wrote. Despite what Metallica has sadly disintegrated to in the last few years, Fade To Black does and will always own you.  <br /> <br />5. Trapped Under Ice (4:03) 7/10 <br /> <br />Evidently, Side A of RTL is very near absolute perfection. However, unfortunately Side B will not quite live up to its predecessor. First track up is Trapped Under Ice, although not necessarily a bad song, it definitely pales when compared to the four previous classics. There are three sections of guitar shreds and a decent riff section at 2:00-2:25, but other than that, this is an average effort by Metallica. <br />  <br /> <br />6. Escape (4:23) 4/10 <br /> <br />Escape is a definite miss for the band. It is ultimately labeled as filler by most fans, and rightfully so. The structure is unorganized, with bits and pieces of ideas distributed poorly. The songwriting is disappointing. Not to mention the closing bridge is down right awful, especially crammed in with that horrendous siren. It does have a few reasonable left over riffs here and there but do \\"escape\\" this mediocrity with the skip button. <br /> <br />7. Creeping Death (6:36) 8/10 <br /> <br />Although being one of the most popular songs on the record, Creeping Death is probably also the most overrated. However, this is not a bad song by any means. The intro riff is an infectious hook, and Hammett gives a great minute solo at 2:48. The riff section following the solo is a good progression from the one on Trapped Under Ice. During the conclusion, there are some lovely guitar harmonies that really shine through.  <br /> <br />8. The Call of Ktulu (8:52) 9/10 <br /> <br />Don't let the writing credits mislead you. This entire instrumental is written by Mustaine, and features his patented Spider Chords that wonderfully progresses and evolves throughout the whole song. Following with yet another melodic intro, the song breaks out at 1:24 and screams of total guitar technique for the next 8 minutes. Around the 3:32 mark, a breathtaking solo is weaved into the chords and changes key several times. Then, just like the previous song, guitar harmonies are greatly emphasized during the end. The only problem with this track is that it does seem to drag on too long. There also seems to be more variations in the first 5 minutes than the latter 4, which will cause the listener to slightly lose interest. However, TCOK is a great way to conclude the album.  <br /> <br />Package 10/10 <br />Ride The Lightning without a doubt has the best cover art in the history of Metallica's career. Although very simple, the metaphor for the electric chair to the lightning is just pure genius. The cover alone is so immediately recognizable that even fans in mainstream music can distinguish it from just a glance. The band logo never looked better draped in white and blue with streaks of lightning branching out. This is one of the most memorable metal album covers of all time. <br /> <br />Production 10/10 <br />Along with the music, the production for Ride The Lightning is also eons ahead of its time. It unquestionably owns all other sophomoric releases from the \\"Big Four\\" of Thrash in terms of sound quality. The riffs are heavy, yet incredibly clear. The solos are crisp, and the drumming sounds fantastic. Hetfield's voice is an immense improvement from the raw raspy performance he gave on Kill Em All. An album with such solid production in 1984 is truly incredible. A re-master is really not even necessary. <br /> <br />Replayability 10/10 <br />Ride The Lightning is really the first thrash album to include melody from the classic guitar style mostly introduced by Burton. In addition to Dave Mustaine's influences aside from his brilliant guitar writing conveyed through the instrumental and the title track, this album has a lot of variety. Thus, the diversity between songs on top of the plethora of famous riffs and solos makes Ride The Lightning even more enjoyable.      <br /> <br />Content 10/10 <br />Metallica's second album really surprised the music world with their song writing talent and maturity at such an early period of time. The lyrical content reflects as much variety as the music. The opening track is about the nuclear holocaust. The title track is about one's feelings moments before execution on an electric chair. \\"Fade To Black\\" shows a different side of the band, expressing emotions for suicide. \\"Creeping Death\\" follows its predecessor \\"The Four Horsemen\\" from Kill Em All as another variation of a tale from the bible. For Whom The Bell Tolls has some of the best lyrics James Hetfield ever wrote. The content of Ride The Lightning is a definite pivotal part of this album's critical success. <br /> <br />Essentialness 10/10 <br />Although Master of Puppets is blindly hailed by most Metallica fans as their greatest album, the true metal fans tend to prefer Ride The Lightning. Both are extremely essential albums, and undoubtedly a wonderful gateway into the realm of heavy metal for new fans. This is one of the best Thrash albums of all time, although one of the earliest. Ride The Lightning enunciates the epitome of the glory days of Metallica, a time of direction and passion for music that today seems so very distant.    <br /> <br />90.0% <br />
0812580346|5.0|This is about the sixth Sawyer book I have read and like the other five, it delivers!  Sawyer has a way of making highly likable characters and weaving in high tech science in terms that any layman can understand. <br /> <br />Lloyd and Theo are scientists performing at an experiment CERN to prove a long held scientific theory.  Unknown to the scientist, the earth is being bombarded by a neutrino blast, remnants of a star that went nova, at the same time they are doing their experiment.  The combination of the two conditions causes the entire world population to black out and have their minds shift 20 years into the future.  Each person can observe their future self for about 2 minutes, and then are shifted back to their present day self. <br /> <br />This creates a whole slew of problems.  Many people (probably millions world-wide) in the present time die during this experiment because they blacked out while driving a car or climbing stairs or while having an operation.  One of the people killed is a young daughter of Lloyd's fiancee (she was hit by an out of control car).  This creates a big moral issue for Lloyd, who also has to deal with the fact that in his own glimpse of the future he is married to a woman who is not his present day fiancee. <br /> <br />Theo had no glimpse of the future, which means that in 20 years he will be dead.  Theo later learns that he will be murdered one day prior to that future date because many people saw his obituary during their glimpse.  This causes Theo to investigate who would want to kill him 20 years hence. <br /> <br />The whole story tries to answer the question as to whether the future is fixed or do we have free choice to make our future?  Is the future that was glimpsed the only possible future, or is it one of many possible futures based on the choices we can make?   <br /> <br />The ending of the book is a slight letdown but you will get to it so fast (the book is hard to put down) that it doesn't really matter. <br /> <br />
B00005JNEI|5.0|I saw the movie the day after it arrived in theaters.  After being extremely disappointed with \\"Bowling for Columbine\\" I was not expecting to be awed by Fahrenheit.  It was moving.  It was eye-opening in showing the unholy alliance between the Bush, Saud and bin Laden families.  Most of all it was Patriotic! Leaving the theater I really felt that love of country one gets when reading the words of Lincoln, seeing the Mississippi for the first time or recalling the sacrifices at Normandy. What really amazed me was hearing two commentators on local talk radio actually encourage the U.S. government to arrest Michael Moore for treason.  I think that is the real lesson of this movie. We are in danger as a society not only from terrorists, but from those who would take away our civil liberties in order to secure their power/dynasty.  \\"Dissent\\" is being turned into a dirty word just like \\"liberal\\" was turned into a perjorative. <br />See this movie America and then vote to restore our tarnished reputation among the family of nations.  Vote so that the rest of the world might have some reason to help us defeat terrorism and bring order to that mess in Iraq. Vote if you love America.
B00003CXCT|4.0|Well the DVD set is really 5*.  But had to give it a -1 for the cheap packing, and for changing Anakin's Force ghost to Hayden Christensen instead of Sebastian Shaw.
B00005JMEW|5.0|No one can dispute that Kill Bill is a violent movie...but hey, that's Tarantino's style.  The film opens up with a hardcore fight in sleepy suburbia, which shocks you into paying attention and makes you ask, \\"What is up with these women?\\"  And to find out, you have to keep paying attention.  As the film progresses, and you learn more about The Bride and why she's so mad, you sympathize and root for her, which makes most of the violence more palpable, because most of the victims had it coming.
B00028HBL6|5.0|In my opinion one must ignore all controversial reviews and see it for yourself. It's been going on for centuries surrounding how Christ died and who killed him. This film does not reflect that at all and doesn't put any one group in jeopardy. It was our sins that nailed Jesus to the cross. His love kept him there. Remember when Jesus said he had the power to lay down his life and take it up again. This command came from His Father in Heaven. This is also written in the Scriptures of the four Gospels.<br /><br />&#60;P&#62;<br /><br />The film itself is beautifully portrayed and well-acted. The artistry is superb in authentic art and culture of biblical times. Jim Caveziel who plays the part of Jesus Christ so well that you think it's Jesus himself who took over the part. He looks like him and acts like him! His role is sincere and powerful. Maia Morgansten who plays his mother, Mary is beautiful in her role as she follows her son Jesus from the trial, scourging and the cross. The graphic violence maybe too intense for small children. So adults should review before letting young children view it. One may question why Gibson's film was so violent? He did a good job in sticking with the Scriptures according to the prophecy in Isaiah chapters 52 & 53. The crucifixion an ancient form of execution invented by the Romans was not a pleasant sight. According to history when crucifixion was in use unfortunate candidates were tortured or flogged before being hung and some didn't survive the horrible beatings.<br /><br />&#60;P&#62;<br /><br />The Passion is a film of painful beauty and sacrifical love of mankind. It is spoken in Aramaic (ancient Hebrew) and Latin with English subtitles. But one can understand the language by heart just by watching the suffering of Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. It's one of the best Christian film on the subject of how Christ really suffered and died for all of us. It has a nice end that doesn't leave the viewer thinking that Christ just died and shows He victoriously rose from the grave on the third day. It makes an excellent witnessing tool, plus a keeper in your film collection. I highly recommend!ctoriously rose from the grave on the third day.

B00005JMUA|5.0|The second half of the Kill Bill movies uses less violence than the first, and is more character driven than the first.  Many questions are cleared up regarding how the chapel massacre came to pass and why Bill did what he did.  In answering those questions, we get a sense of how evil Bill is and how richly he diserves his fate.  The most violent part is during the showdown between the Bride and the one-eyed blonde which has got to be one of the most exiting fight scenes that I have seen this year.    I say it's better with the first one, but one could get away with seeing vol. 2 without the first seeing Vol. 1, but I would recommend seeing both.

B000002IP1|5.0|Oh what a wonderful decade the 1980s were in terms of music. For all of the chaotic changes overtaking the world around the end of the decade and the transition into the Post-Cold War period especially with the tearing down of the Berlin Wall, 1989 also in my opinion was the greatest year for music and this album closes the year as well as the decade out on a high note. The hauntingly beautiful classic \\"Another Day In Paradise\\" was a childhood favorite and a song that had a profound impact on me during my childhood.<br /><br /> Hot off the heals of the success of the 1986 classic \\"Invisible Touch\\" with his band Genesis along with a phenomenally successful tour, Phil Collins returns to his solo arena and takes the drivers seat once again with his fourth and best solo album of his career 1989's timeless \\"But Seriously\\" and the title is spot on perfect. Gone is most of the sunny summertime tropical flavor of \\"No Jacket Required\\" and the sound is far more serious and more dramatic than anything he's ever done before. While no stranger to socially conscious lyrics, (he did many socially conscious songs with Genesis), the lyrics are also much darker, more powerful, and among the most thought-provoking I've ever listened to but they are backed up by utterly powerful anthems with songs like \\"Colours\\", and \\"Another Day In Paradise\\". To me \\"But Seriously\\" is without a doubt Phil Collins' pinnacle of his solo career, or his entire music career altogether.<br /><br /> Along onboard on this successful project both commercially and artistically, is a wide variety of friends and guest musicians on many of the tracks. They range from David Crosby, to former Policeman Sting, to even his former band mate Peter Gabriel. Eric Clapton is the one who plays the blues-sounding guitar on his smash hit ballad \\"I Wish It Would Rain\\" down. While not immediately noticeable but Sting is also present on the background and one can hear him if one has good ears.<br /><br />\\"That's Just The Way It Is\\" is an eerie number about the theme of war and conflict. The song becomes very intense and dramatic as Phil's voice soars to an incredible climax. I love how the song itself merges into a parade of Irish bagpipes and parade drums to round out the track. \\"Heat On The Street\\" is a really fun and powerful pop classic rocker that is without a doubt 100 percent Phil.<br /><br />In terms of socially-conscious songwriting, the nearly 9 minute epic track entitled \\"Colours\\" is arguably among some of the greatest socially conscious tracks ever written by anyone. I would almost go far as to say that it's even more powerful than a lot of what Janet's Rhythm Nation brings out and rivals the power of anything on Peter Gabriel's \\"Melting Face\\" album from nine years before then. The first 2 and a half minutes of this song are very eerie and having a very soft but cold winter melody and blasts into a beautiful climax as Phil asks who do you blame \\"Tell me what can you say! Tell me what do you blame!\\". Those are among some of the most powerful lyrics of my childhood. The first chapter in the track echoes away into a mechanical sounding industrial rhythm and an African Xylophone with an ominous undertone like a storm brewing overhead before bouncing back as a face-paced pop/rock song with a far more upbeat tone and the return of the Phoenix Horns to create one of the greatest tracks that I've ever heard from Phil. I would even go far enough to say that this is almost as progressive as anything that he did with Genesis! Awesome stuff I tell you.<br /><br />This album isn't all excessively serious and bleak though. That wouldn't be until \\"Both Sides\\" came along four years later. \\"Hang on Long Enough\\" is pure fun and highly energetic. \\"Something Happened on the Way To Happen\\" is a fun, and rocking classic and one of the best on this album and is almost as happy, and upbeat as almost anything from \\"No Jacket Required\\". The same is true with the semi-ballad \\"All of My Life\\" which is among the few songs where a saxophone is present. \\"Saturday Night Sunday Morning\\" is a brief interlude with really fast placed drumming and those all too familiar Phoenix Horns and the song slows down into a groovy bluesy track for the remaining 50 seconds. \\"Do You Remember\\" is classic Phil and a great classic ballad that unfortunately wasn't included on his \\"Hits\\" collection. Ironically while it's definitely a very good song, it's probably my least favorite song but even then it's still very good.<br /><br />\\"Father Son\\" is one of my favorite non-single ballads ever by Phil Collins having a very warm and sweet and hopeful tone to it and the song becomes hauntingly beautiful towards the last minute of the song with the sparkling keyboard effects. The album closes with the powerful anthem entitled \\"Find a Way To Your Heart\\". The song begins with a Space Age rock intro, becomes a haunting ambient pop classic with intense and frantic rhythm and finally becomes a high energy pop classic with a lot of those trademark Phoenix Horns and a highly upbeat mood. Finally the song fades back into the haunting Space Age sounding guitar effects which rounds out this amazing musical journey.<br /><br />\\"Another Day In Paradise\\" is the best song on this album and was my childhood favorite song. This song really changed my view on things just out of it's beautiful melody and Phil's incredible singing and lyrics. While just the dark twilight melody was what really turned me onto this song back when I was just a child when it was new, this has now become an absolutely life-changing track because it was one of the first songs that ever actually grabbed my attention and turned me into a music lover from there onwards. The dark and industrial intro gives away to the unforgettable sound that we have never forgotten ever since. The song is a vivid and dark insight into the plight of a homeless human being and it's lyrics paint the picture from both the homeless person's perspective as well as a bystander's point of view.<br /><br />As I look back on it now, the fact that this song actually made it to number one and and stayed there for several weeks from Christmas of 1989 and into January of 1990 and even unfortunately prevented Janet's \\"Rhythm Nation\\" from making the top spot for a while (No pun intended, that track also deserved to be number one as well) is without a doubt one of the best music chart moments in history. That this track also won a Grammy is among the best things to me anyways to happen to music. This song got the justice and praise that it deserved and that it's still a hugely popular track today is testament to the longevity and power of this amazing classic. I literally broke down in tears of joy after I saw him perform it live in concert. How someone could write a song so powerful and lasting I don't know but Phil did it!<br /><br />I highly recommend all of his solo albums including his most recent one \\"Testify\\" but put his 1989 magnum-opus \\"But Seriously\\" at the top of your list. This album was brilliant back when it was released and more than 15 years onwards it is an absolute classic today that doesn't sound the slightest bit dated even when placed against most newer releases of the 2000s.

0060920084|5.0|I can't tell how much I laughed while reading this book. I discovered this book by accident in a B&N store, just after reading 2 pages I had to get it. Don't listen to all the -ve reviews here. Obviously these people couldn't laugh at themselves. Trust me I lived in a small town in Illinois and I know what it is like. I do agree that sometimes he is little too frank, but thats his style and thats the beauty of the book. He not only makes fun of small town America, but he laughs at himself. This is the first book I have read by him, and I am already reading his other book on Europe. Just give this rib-tickler a read within an open mind.
B00005JLCI|5.0|At first, I was convinced that Laurence Olivier's Oscar-winning 1948 intepretation of William Shakespeare's classic tragedy of betrayal, murder and revenge (see my review on it) was the only version of the play worth viewing and that all other versions (including this one) must pale in comparison to Sir Laurence Olivier's timeless retelling of the story; who can dare to top the greatest Shakespearean actor of all time? But after seeing Kenneth Branagh's 1993 adaptation of \\"Much Ado About Nothing\\" (which he starred in, adapted for the screen, produced and directed), I thought, 'Maybe his version of \\"Hamlet\\" isn't so bad after all. One can see his devotion to Shakespeare (proven with \\"Henry V\\", though I haven't seen it, but I'll give his \\"Hamlet\\" a shot, see how the \\"Brief Violent Images and Some Sexuality crept in\\" (there wasn't any in the play) and see which of these two actors gives a better intepretation of the Bard's melancholy Dane.\\" After seeing it, I capitulated immediately, as you shall see why from here on out. I also resolved to see any other movie version of whichever play the Bard had written the which he was involved in, whether it be doing all four jobs or just one.<br /><br />Kenneth Branagh did a BRILLIANT job in adapting Shakespeare's play for the modern day crowd, WITHOUT changing the setting or removing a line of dialogue. He used EVERY line in the play, making it a three hour epic. Laurence Olivier also did an excellent job with the DEFINITIVE version of \\"Hamlet\\", for those who enjoy his movies (I do too, but I wanted to see how Mr. Branagh played Hamlet and IF he's better than Sir Laurence Olivier; I'm undecided because both actors were VERY GOOD in both versions). For some, this may be the definitive version of \\"Hamlet\\" as it uses every line in the play, but for me, Sir Laurence Olivier's 1948 version is the better one because it was the first one and the first is usually the best. Kenneth Branagh played the Danish prince perfectly, fleshing him (and the other characters) out more by restoring the lines cut by Sir Laurence Olivier in the 1948 classic (not that it was bad, it was neccessary, because how much of a play [or book] can you squeeze into a 2-2/1/2 hour film?) Point is, he remained faithful to the main idea of the story, which is Hamlet's wondering how his father died, who killed his father when he finds out his task \\"If ever didst thy dear father love\\" is to \\"Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder\\", his discovering who did it and his indecision to \\"Sweep to my revenge,\\" played out perfectly. For those who didn't understand what Ophelia meant by \\"He hath, my lord, made many tenders of his affection to me\\" and \\"Before you tumbled me, you promised me to wed\\", Branagh throws in some brief sex scenes, (NO nudity) implied in the dialogue between Ophelia and Polonius in Act 1, Scene III and when she goes mad. Also, for those who wanted William Shakespeare 'Souped up' (no pun on the Bard intended whatsoever), Branagh adds some violent images (flashbacks of his father's murder and the ground shaking violently when the Ghost is uneasy, also having fire come up from the ground as he's running through a forest). Part I ends with Hamlet saying for his thoughts to \\"Be bloody or be nothing worth\\", better than I thought it would end. Part II begins with Derek Jacobi doing a voiceover, giving a quick summary of what happened in Part I, over footage from the 1st part before going on with the rest of the story. Nice work, amigo. That was very dramatic, more so than even Shakespeare could've made it and it worked like a very healthy charm. Branagh is as good as Olivier in interpreting the Bard. No unneccessary additions, just pure Shakespeare.<br /><br />The long-awaited DVD of this wonderful movie is excellent: a 7-minute introduction by Kenneth Branagh, a feature-length commentary by Branagh & text advisor Russell Jackson, an insightful featurette \\"To Be On Camera: A History With Hamlet,\\" a 12-minute Cannes promo for the film and seven theatrical trailers. I cannot recommend this movie enough. 4 hours of Shakespeare equals pure fun for me. Rated PG for some violence.lm and seven theatrical trailers.

B0002OERI0|1.0|Yes there was a big fuss when they signed with \\"Warner Brothers,\\" the terms sell-out and posuers often came with the name Green Day, but I disagree, selling out is when you change music styles to make money, they didn't sellout then, they sold out now. This album is horrible, the only good song is \\"American Idiot,\\" the rest just doesn't sound like them, it sounds forced and just bad in general. I miss Green Day, the old Green Day, if they came back to their roots they'd make money, sure not as much, but they'd also gain alot of respect from disillusioned fans like myself and many many others.
0061020710|4.0|\\"The Color of Magic\\" is the first book in Terry Pratchett's hugely popular Discworld Series. He has gone on to win the Carnegie Medal for \\"The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents\\" and was awarded the OBE in 1998.  <br /> <br />The Discworld is, of course, flat and rests on the shoulders of four giant elephants. These are, in turn, carried through the cosmos by an even bigger turtle called Great A'Tuin. (The astrozoologists of the land of Krull, in their desire to better understand the universe, shortly hope to determine whether A'Tuin is male or female). The Discworld's Gods and Goddesses live in Dunmanifestin, on top of Cori Celesti. Their favourite pastimes include playing games with the lives of mortals, with Fate and the Lady featuring highly amongst the leading players. <br /> <br />One of the Lady's favourite 'pieces' is Rincewind - a native of the Discworld's oldest city, Ankh-Morpork, and a coward of some renown. He is also an ex-student of the Unseen University, a thoroughly hopeless wizard and the 'hero' of this book. The only spell he knows comes from the Octavo, and is so powerful that no other spell is brave enough to stay in his head. (The Octavo was the Creator's spellbook, and was carelessly left behind after the universe's completion). As the book opens, Rincewind's home city is in flames and he is fleeing in the company of Twoflower - the Discworld's first tourist. Twoflower, who has just introduced the concept of fire insurance to Ankh-Morpork, comes from the Counterweight Continent and has hired Rincewind as his guide. He also has a very loyal and frequently angry Luggage, which is made from sapient pearwood. Twoflower desperately wants to see the very things that Rincewind desperately wants to avoid - heroes (Hrun the barbarian, for example), dragons, fights and such like. As a result, Death has been snapping at Rincewind's heels since he first met Twoflower - that is, of course, the tall and under-fed gentleman who wears a hood, carries ascythe and TALKS LIKE THIS. To avoid meeting his fate, Rincewind is willing to travel to the very ends of the world... <br /> <br />As the first book in the Discworld series, this is probably the most obvious place to start. (It's certainly best to read it before \\"The Light Fantastic\\", the series' second instalment - while the pair form a prelude to \\"Interesting Times\\", the seventeenth Discworld book). Pratchett's books are always very funny, and Rincewind and the Luggage are two of my favourite characters. Definitely recommended !
B00005JNEI|5.0|The title say's enough to disply my bias. However, I'm not the ideal liberal that runs around agreeing with everything liberal. Sure, I'm liberal, I am atheist, heck, I'm even vegetarian! However, I don't like pro-choice arguments, don't like femminist lies and exagerations, nor do I subscribe to the \\"get angry by-proxy\\" thing that many liberals subscribe to. <br /> <br />So, case in poing, I am an objective person above all else. Farenheit 9/11 is one of the most important movies of our time. It shows real video footage, with little to no personal bias in the movie. Sure, Moore covered what he wanted to cover, but what the heck else is a filmaker to do anyway? The video footage of Bush speaking and of Iraq, and of families of soldiers, as well as soldiers themselves, say what needs to be said in the film. Moore simply put it together, so the idea that its a movie full of lies is laughable at best. <br /> <br />Get this movie, own it, watch it and think hard about your right to vote in this country because we have much more power if we are informed.
B000000OU0|4.0|When I saw this mix in the stores recently, I was struck by the combination of songs that seemed to ring out the sorrow of lost love, the compound mild resentment, and recognized the tone as one most men in that circumstance default to: the shifting of cares and worries to the wind, to get out from under any semblance of guilt. The detached emotional reactions of soul-saving grace, each song is like the siren of a sorrowful whale, and done magnificently. But one worries about the source of the dispassionate shelving of yet another disappointment, buried.

All I can really say is that this is a movie that needs to be experienced for youself. <br /> <br />I was disappointed by the fact that the DVD only has language and audio features- no special documentaries or commentaries.  Mel did this so everyone could draw their own conclusion from the movie and do their own research on whether or not the film was accurate and so that you could draw your own conclusion based upon your own experience. <br /> <br />In my opinion, I feel that this is the greatest movie ever made to this point- primarily because of the depth and richness of its content and the message portrayed through Christ's suffering.  Only thing is- you have to understand why Christ died before you can really appreciate this movie to its fullest.
B00003CXCT|1.0|If you have seen the original, don't waste your money on this. <br /> <br />I saw the original episode IV in the theater in the 70's and I recorded it to tape when it was the movie of the week. I bought this 4 pack dvd hoping to see great video but this is a total rip off. Episode IV is not the duplicate of the original theater release - for example - when Darth Vader enters the ship the princess inserts a disk in r2d2 and records whats going on and why she needs help - that's cut completely - and later on when Luke gets the droids and goes to play the message r2d2 says he has - instead of seeing the 70's version of a really neat 3d Hieroglyphic of the princess talking - its all cut out. You dont see it until Luke plays it for OB-One Kanobe and then you wonder what the connection is because you never saw when it was made and why. <br /> <br />The story now has no real basis to grow on and relies on just visual effects. Five minutes into this I knew it was not worth it - unless you never saw it before. This is not worth the price for those who saw the original. <br /> <br />I didn't bother watching the other dvd's in the 4 pack. I figured if they messed with the original, the rest were cut to ribbons too and they probably did it to make it fit to the DVD digital limits. I'll try the VHS format. At least I get to see the original full length version - even if the quality is lower. <br />

B00003CXCT|5.0|I have been and always will be a fan of the STAR WARS movies. I was five years old when I saw STAR WARS at the drive-in. I remember begging my parents to stay and see the movie again when an announcement came on saying we could stay and see it again for free.  <br /> I enjoyed seeing the additions to the DVD. I have seen these movies many times. It truely is like seeing them again for the first time. The scene that suprised me the most was the fight with the Rancor in RETURN OF THE JEDI. It didn't look like it was shot in front of a blue screen. <br /> I don't blame George Lucas for wanting to complete these movies. I wish he had put the other deleted scenes in STAR WARS. I have bought all but one release of these movies. I feel if we want to see the whole story completed, we should buy the different versions of the films. To help fund the making of the new movies. Didn't George Lucas say that the black box set of the original version of the trilogy was going to be the last? <br /> The main reason I like DVD's is for the added scenes and special features. You didn't get all of these wonderful features on the old VHS tapes. You can not satisfy everyone. In my opinion the pros definitely outweigh the cons.  If you are a fan of the STAR WARS films, go and buy the DVD. I think it is worth it.

0060989157|5.0|Being a Motley Crue fan, I much anticipated reading this book.  Also being slightly familiar with the antics of Motley Crue, the story was exactly what I expected it was, the story of four Rock `N Roll degenerates.  However, as I read on, the book became much more than sex, drugs, and rock `n roll.<br /><br />\\"The Dirt\\" is a unique biography on the band Motley Crue.  The book mostly follows a chronological timeline of the history of the band, just like every other biography for the most part.  What makes this book unique is that the story is being told by different people, mainly the band members with some stories from managers and promoters.  I enjoyed this unique aspect as I found it very interesting the way the band members had very different views of the same situation.  It seems that the band could not agree on if the sky was blue.<br /><br />I personally found the beginning of the book repetitive.  Actually, the first half of the book revolves around wild parties, lots of booze, enough drugs to keep South America in business for a year, and countless women performing demeaning sexual acts.  While I initially found the story shocking and intriguing, it was the same thing over and over.  The only thing that changes was the cities.<br /><br />The story picks up again right about the time Vince Neil kills the passenger in this car as the band begins approaching rock bottom.  As the band begins rehab, their life stories really seem to come out.  As the book progresses, the reader can clearly see the members of the band quickly grow from die hard partied young adult to grown men on a mission.  While I thought the stories of the partying and the drugs would be the high point of the book, I felt that the stories of the band members acting like men (such as Nikki and his sister and Tommy taking this son to school) was actually the shocking part of the book.<br /><br />The following is a brief summary of the 4 original members of the band:<br /><br />Nikki Sixx:  While it seemed he would take enough drugs to kill a horse, he was a surprisingly sensitive man.  He blamed much of his problems on abandonment issues that he had with his Dad.<br /><br />Mick Mars:  Mick seemed to be the outsider of the band.  It seemed to Mick that the band was just a job, not something really personal like the other members felt.  Surprisingly, he seemed to be the brains of the band.  I did find his medical problem to be a big surprise.  No matter how big the band got, it always seemed that he was broke.<br /><br />Vince Neil:  I found Vince to be the most intriguing member of the group.  Most any person familiar with Motley Crue knows of Vince's fatal car accident involving Razzle (of Hanoi Rocks I think), for which Vince was sentenced to thirty days in jail.  For an event I thought would be the cornerstone of the guys life, the car accident didn't even cover 10 pages.  However, later in the book, Vince did tell the heartbreaking story of Skylar, this daughter who died at a very young age.  If nothing else, the story of this brave little girl who knew she was never coming home made the whole book worth reading; this is the one part of the book that actually brought me to tears.<br /><br />Tommy Lee:  Throughout most of the book, he seemed like the stereotypical mindless stoner.  However, right around the time his first child was born, Tommy seemed to grow up in a huge hurry.  His last couple chapters of the book I felt were intelligent.  I even though the chapter about taking his son to school was heart-warming, definitely something I would not expect from Motley Crue.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who grew up with music from the \\"hairband era\\".  I would highly encourage any person who was a fan of Motley Crue to definitely read this book.  However, this book is definitely not for young readers or other \\"impressionable\\" people as this book is full of bad things that they could get ideas from.x:  While it seemed he would take enough drugs to kill a horse, he was a surprisingly sensitive man.

B00005JNEI|5.0|every time i bring up this movie at work i get a bunch of people say \\"that guy is a big, fat, liar. why do you support that guy?\\" i just say that im going in to this election with an open mind and a boat load of facts. that shuts them up for a second.i saw this movie on july 4th. and it suprised me that i was in a sold out show at 10 am in the morning and every show was sold out for the entire night. after the film all i heard was a huge round of applause. and when i exited the theater i saw at least 200 people waiting to see it. this film set a new standard for truth and should be viewed by everyone before the 2004 election. and i hear alot of people saying bad things about john kerry, but he has one thing that george bush doesn't. HE'S NOT GEORGE BUSH.
B000088E6D|3.0|I have heard a lot about Mike over the last year and I finally decided to buy one of his cds and see what the fuss was all about. <br /> <br />I'm hear to tell you this young talent is for real. He has a very pleasent voice and a great style. He kind of reminds me of Paul Anka. By the way Paul was the exec. producer of this cd. <br /> <br />For this project Mike used some great arrangers. One I would like to point out is Johnny Mandel. He did a super job with his arrangements. <br /> <br />The only down side to this cd was the repertoire. I thouhgt it could have been a little bit better. That was why I only gave this cd a 3 star rating. My rating had nothing to do with Mike's voice or preformance. <br /> <br />I would like to recommend this cd.
B0001ADAVK|4.0|I'm a guy who started college the year this story began. Boy did it bring back memories. I watched it with a woman in the same age bracket and each of us cringed with the truths we remembered. Instructors subject to curfews, predatory professors, unchanging lesson plans, drinking at proms, pushy parents, that stolen \\"adult\\" week-end, and social pecking orders. <br /> <br />There were only a few false spots. I suspect they grew out of telling a 50 year-old story by 35 year-old writers. <br /> <br />For parents of teen-aged girls. Tell them they can't watch it to make sure they want to. They need to see where we came from.
B000000OA6|5.0|It's hard to believe that this is the last album Queen released as a foursome. Released in 1991, not too long before Freddie's death, this truly shows Queen at their finest. It's one of those albums you can listen to all the way through. Starting with the six-minute epic \\"Innuendo\\", and ending with the powerful \\"The Show Must Go On,\\" this album is a must have for any Queen fan, or any rock fan for that matter.  <br />1. Innuendo (10/10) <br />2. I'm Going slightly Mad (10/10) <br />3. Headlong (8/10) <br />4. I Can't Live with You (7.5/10) <br />5. Don't Try So Hard (9/10) <br />6. Ride the Wild Wind (8/10) <br />7. All God's People (7.5/10) <br />8. These Are the Days of Our Lives (10/10) <br />9. Delilah (8/10) <br />10. The Hitman (8.5/10) <br />11. Bijou (9.5/10) <br />12. The Show Must Go On (10+) <br />The last song on the CD is, in my opinion, one of the best Queen songs ever. As you listen to Freddie sing, it's not apparent in any way he was ill. His voice was still as beautiful as ever, and he went out at the top. It pains me to listen to the song, because it seems like a song Freddie wrote about his battle with his illness. \\"The Days of our Lives\\" seems like Freddie's farewell song. When he says at the end, \\"I still love you,\\" I tear up. Freddie Mercury was the best songwriter/singer/performer that I have ever known, and I will remember him forever!
B0002OERI0|4.0|Though i like old green day better (who doesn't) they are still one of the best punk rock bands out there.  This album is mostly great, tracks 1,2,3,4 are the best and the rest of the album is pretty good, i would probably say track 4 is my favorite, its a really deep song.  The vocals are improved, but really he stayed pretty much the same, tres drumming is as usual incredible, and of course the bass work and guitar work is simple yet still rocking and soundin great.  Overall its probably their 3rd best album so definetly you should get it.  8 out of a 10.
B00001OH7P|5.0|There are only four CD's that I will listen to completely: \\"The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust\\", \\"Low\\", \\"A Night at the Opera\\", and \\"Innuendo\\" (the last 2 ablums are by Queen.) Released in early 1972, not long after \\"Hunky Dory\\", this album introduced us to a character: Ziggy Stardust. David Bowie and his mates outdo themselves on this album. Bowie is one of the greatest artists of the 20th century, and this album is a must for rock fans.  <br />1. Five Years (9.5/10) <br />2. Soul Love (8/10) <br />3. Moonage Daydream (8/10) <br />4. Starman (9/10) <br />5. It Ain't Easy (8.5/10) <br />6. Lady Stardust (9/10) <br />7. Rock and Roll Star (9/10) <br />8. Hang on to Yourself (9/10) <br />9. Ziggy Stardust (10/10) <br />10. Suffragette City (9/10) <br />11. Rock and Roll Suicide (10/10) <br />   David Bowie is the most beautiful rocker from his time (and Freddie Mercury...), and I will always love him. I recomend this album to anyone who likes classic 70's rock, or is looking to add to their Bowie collection.
0761119752|5.0|(OK, that's not actually a line from the book.)<BR>I started reading this book to my son when he was just a few months old.

B000001IPL|5.0|No one will ever see this review. Although, I feel it is necessary to write it because I have never truly tried to put my feelings about this particular album into words. Trying to explain to friends does not work... <br />   Anyway, I think for some people, Smash still raises goosebumps after a long decade of growing up. It is not a homage to the \\"roots\\". to the plad kilts, the duct tape, and the boots. There it gets little cred; this is somewhat ironic. The supposid base of punk built itself on deviation from the norm but cannot appreciate this album for that very reason. At the same time parents, in addition to purists, despised it (mine did). Ergo, The Offspring achieve a uniquely rebellious niche. They piss off the usual authority and they piss off the punk old school or \\"real\\" punk crowd.  <br />   Smash is what some call \\"power punk\\". It is a different departure: much cleaner and free flowing than traditional punk rock. The riffs, bass, and drumlines are molded into a sharp steel instrument for cutting versus the jagged and ugly edge of traditional punk, whatever. Most underground punk music is only enjoyed by its purveyors; its fan base is small for a reason, most of it is dull and sucks. Anyone, minus parents, can listen to Smash and for a few minutes and tell you it is something special to rock. Most of its tracks start on an open-ended chord and drop like a cliff jump into a thumping bass-drum pulse and flowing, precisely melodic cascade of stainless strings. Smash- a wholy appropriate title. It picks up punk, sharpens, and polishes it, and weilds it in a way not done prior or since. Buy it and maybe you would understand \\"power punk\\" as tempered by The Offspring.
B0000026KQ|1.0|I am so dissapointed in this CD. I bought it because I have \\"Blow By Blow\\" and \\"Jeff Beck with the Jan Hammer Group\\" and I love those CDs. This crap sounds like somebody that heard those recordings, practiced for one week and tried to do an imitation of them. I don't like one cut on the entire CD. I only gave it one star because I couldn't find a way to give it less.

6304383177|5.0|There have been some great reviews here. I will add my two cents, in the remote hope that some Film executive will see this and hasten it DVD!  <br />It is 'the' classic romantic comedy, the type that you can watch over and over and over. Its well written, directed by the legendary Howard Hawks but the main reason for its appeal is the chemistry of Hepburn and Grant and Grant's masterful but subtle physical comedy.  <br />Without a large budget, or cast of thousands, Hawks has created a world that I wish I could jump into.
B00013RC9I|4.0|Admittedly, I've found it a bit difficult to glom onto anything authentically \\"French\\" of late.  But this CD deserves attention. It reaches emotional plateaus and evokes feelings of longing, beauty, and pure joy - sort of like sweets for the soul.<br /><br />And no, this is not a warm, fuzzy, \\"feel good\\" album.  The electronic treatments are haunting and unique, yet accessible by being layered into familiar song structures.  Lilting melodies collapsing into staccato half-beats (\\"Cherry Blossom Girl\\"), funereal, spacey piano notes dissolving into bells and electronic crickets (\\"Venus\\"), playful, sexy vocals converting into trance-inducing electronic percussion and a sublimely soothing chorus (\\"Run\\").  The first three songs really grab the listener by the lapels, gently - mind you, but insistently.  These opening tracks alone are worth the price of admission.<br /><br />The rest is breezy and just plain easy on the mind.  \\"Surfin' on a Rocket\\" (sampled on that SUV ad w/ the family going surfing), the goofy  whistling on \\"Alpha Beta Gaga\\" (somewhat of a throwaway track), banjo-laced \\"Biological\\" (featuring an amazing, awe-inspiring meet-your-maker ending), and the Japanese-sounding \\"Alone in Kyoto\\" (with a gentle finale featuring the sound of ocean waves), combine pop sensibility and an ambient down-beat style to create the quintessential \\"chill-out\\" album of our time.  The other tracks - not mentioned here - are all insanely catchy and destined to take up space in your mind - all day long.<br /><br />The lyrics - what lyrics? - if you bother to listen, are goofy, hopelessly superficial and romantic in a childish way.  The French accent is obvious and the English, at times, is awkward. If there is a version of this CD in French, I'd love to hear it.  The lame, sometimes stilted lyrics are the only (mild) drawback to an otherwise exemplary effort.<br /><br />Talkie Walkie evokes space age psychedelia, playful melodies, and pure human warmth.  Electronic music never felt so good.
6305232660|3.0|Of all of the disaster flicks out there, I'd have to rank \\"Deep Impact\\" in the top five.  Why?  Because it makes a good effort at making the viewer feel for the characters involved.  So many of these films are driven by their special effects that the story is left behind in the cosmic dust.  Why then, did I give it only three stars?  For the simple fact that the film does seem to drag along too much for my tastes.  Also, the relationship between Elijah Wood and Lelee Sobieskie isn't that believable.  I understand why they got married, but I just don't \\"feel the love\\" between these two.<br /><br />Rober Duvall turns in a good performance as the \\"old guy\\" sent off to destroy the comet of death with a bunch of hotshot astronauts.  There is a comaraderie between all of the astronauts(and the one cosmonaut) that makes you hope that they pull through this ordeal.  Back on Earth, Tea' Leoni's character is a dead-on representation of a nosey reporter who lets her imagination turn loose in an attempt to gain glory on the television.  The rest of the cast is also very good.<br /><br />If you're looking for a character-driven end-of-the-world flick, this film is for you.  It doesn't have quite the action that a movie like \\"The Core\\" has, but it's science is a lot more believable.  I recommend for an evening at home.  It will pass the time just fine.
B00005JMXX|3.0|Everyone loves a good disaster, and the disater scenes here were classic Roland Emmerich - flying cars, big explosions and all that. Plus we get to see tsunamis and the freezing of New York. Oh what a thrill.<br /><br />Of course the premise is nonsense and has as muich to do about real science and contributing to the global warming debate as \\"Godzilla\\" contributed to the nuclear proliferarion debate or \\"Independance Day\\" had with SETI, and \\"Stargate\\" with Egyptian archealogy.<br /><br />The writers and directors took a news item and turned it into a big disaster epic. Advice to believers of global warming: don't rely on this movie to bolster your case, it ridicules it more than it supports it. Not intentionally of course.<br /><br />I enjoyed it, yeah the science was nonsense and after the initial wave of destruction it sort of turned into a big soap opera, but overall I did enjoy it. Special effects were phenominal, acting was acceptable as was the sound and editing and ther technical aspects of the film making part.<br /><br />Disable the thinking part of your brain during the movie and you'll enjoy it for what it is. I thin it is pretending to be a warning or something. Ignore that element of it and think - Godzilla, Indpendance Day, and Stargate. Just enjoy and laugh when appropriate.
B00000K19E|2.0|The Matrix (The Wachowski Brothers, 1999)<br /><br />So it had been five years since I saw The Matrix. When I originally saw it, I was unimpressed by it; I didn't notice the special effects. (Some people think I'm exaggerating when I say that. I honestly had no idea what people were talking about when they mentioned the bullet-time effects in the movie until almost two years later.) I obviously didn't notice much else, either. I gave it the most lukewarm of positive reviews. But because it has entered into the popular culture as such an influential reference, it's stayed on my mind. The ideas behind the film are intriguing, and I did finally figure out what bullet-time was after watching The Art of War, which was mediocre, but (when I first saw it) superior to The Matrix. Because of all this, when it popped up on a movie channel a couple of nights ago, I decided to give it another go-round, figuring I'd change my opinion of the movie.<br /><br />I have. It's even worse than I originally thought it was.<br /><br />The ideas certainly remain intriguing, but the Wachowski brothers take Morpheus (Apocalypse Now's Larry Fishburne, no matter what he's calling himself these days), who's supposed to be a kind of zen master, and has him spell everything out so that his disciple, Neo (Keanu Reeves, looking about as full of emotion here as he was in Dracula). The love-interest subplot between Neo and Trinity (Memento maven Moss... Carrie-Anne Moss) has so little meat on its bones that the brothers have to resort to a tear-filled \\"I love you\\" scene so the audience gets any clue there's a romantic subplot at all. The human special effects are unbearably cheesy (wire-fu looks even stupider when in slow motion), and the bullet-time has been done so much better in so many other movies I wonder that anyone noticed it. The only special effect that impressed me is the only one that impressed me five years ago, the rushing racks of guns.<br /><br />That it has inspired five years of discussion about its meaning is not in any way a testament to its value as a film; Attack of the Killer Tomatoes is still being discussed after a quarter-century. A better film could have easily inspired the same amount of discussion. More, in fact, and it would have had even more levels. This one just happened to get lucky. **rs of discussion about its meaning is not in any way a testament to its value as a film; Attack of the Killer Tomatoes is still being discussed after a quarter-century.

B0002V7OI8|4.0|Yet another variation on the \\"we're all doomed\\" philosophy that Hollywood en masse loves to embrace \\"Deep Impact\\" is the story of how various people (all from the United States) cope with the imminent disaster of being wiped off the face of the planet. It stars Tea Leoni as Jenny Lerner; a precocious White House reporter who accidentally stumbles across secret information about a natural disaster of cataclysmic proportions.  It seems that earth is in direct line with a giant asteroid. If the asteroid strikes earth, it will bring about the next ice age. Maximilian Schell (Jason) and Vanessa Redgrave (Robin) costar as Jenny's divorced feuding parents. Because no one over the age of forty is being considered for the massive rescue and life preservation effort that is sweeping the country (presumably because future society won't require any intelligence, just a host of sexy youth to help in the procreation phase of mankind volume 2) Robin decides to take her own life. This makes the riff between Jenny and her father almost unbearable. Meanwhile, on another part of the continent young astronomer, Leo Biederman (Elijah Wood) is preparing to take refuge in the woods of California to save himself and his girlfriend, Sarah (Leelee Sobieski) from certain death. Finally, there's Spurgeon Tanner (Robert Duvall), a NASA man and widower who's been pulled out of retirement to front a space mission which will attempt to blow up the asteroid in outer space before it reaches the earth.  <br /> <br />Director, Mimi Ledger is unequal to the task of formulating a cohesive narrative from these bits of life in peril. Instead we're treated to incredibly sappy moments of melodrama which, rather than tugging at our heart strings, serve as glaring reminders of just how awful this sort of disaster epic can be in less skilled hands. There's no consistency to the plot, just bits of chaos buttressed by a lot of tears and some really poor acting. Only Morgan Freeman escapes the deluge of B-movie oblivion, as the very Presidential voice of reason. As though a happy ending confirms some vain attempt at the life affirming message that \\"we shall overcome\\", Ledger's flick ends on a high note that reads more like a tack on than an exaltation of the human spirit.  <br /> <br />Paramount's previous DVD was not anamorphically enhanced for widescreen televisions and I imagine if you're a fan of the film, this is the primary selling feature of this Special Edition reissue. There's also an audio commentary on this edition in which director Leder sounds rather bored by the experience. Three all too brief featurettes that superficially cover the production of the film round out the extras. As for the overall picture quality of the film on this disc - it appears to be the idental image quality as the previous transfer. Colors are vibrant and rich. Black and contrast levels are quite deep and solid. There's a considerable amount of film grain during some sequences while the space segments betray their blue screen and computer compositing by being overly smooth and perfect. The final sequence of this film must have been the inspiration for Roland Emmerich's misguided weather channel disaster epic, \\"The Day After Tomorrow.\\" The audio on \\"Deep Impact\\" is 5.1 Dolby Digital and delivers an aggressive sound field that will surely give your speakers a work out.  <br /> <br />
0060930349|5.0|For all of us whose ancestors came from distant shores, or however we ended up as \\"Americans,\\" this book is rich in details, events and trends that have been woven together to describe our history and what it means to be an American.<br /><br />This reader gained a new sense of pride in what America is and how our history has evolved, and where we are apt to go as a people in the future.  The United States is a melting pot, or a rainbow of different colors, religions and ethnicities, and therein lies its soul, strength, creativity and diversity, and yes tensions.  Johnson's weaving of minute facts into a tapestry that is \\"us\\" deserves to be read and reflected upon by all.  We may not agree with each and every observation or conclusion, but we cannot help to be impressed by the sweep of history that Johnson chronicles and how he methodically marshals his facts into a remarkable and coherent whole, of which each of us is an integral part.<br /><br />I only hated to see the book end, and wished that that I could read about the next 100 years of this \\"grand experiment\\" called democracy, but those pages are being written in history with each passing day, month and year.  While it took the arrival of a new millennium for Johnson to share this monumental undertaking with us, let us hope that similar brilliant works are forthcoming.
B00005JNEI|1.0|You people that support this movie call yourself Americans?  If any of you would actually read online articles by knowledgable politicians, you would come to realize that this movie is a bunch of crap.  The fact is, this movie is aimed at dumb, un-informed Americans like you.  You support this movie, you're falling into the dumb a** pit that Michael Moore wanted you to.  Go ahead, I dare you to research this information and realize that you're a dumb a**.  Its sad what America has come to.  Have you all forgotten the tragedy of 9/11?  Do you really want someone who changes their mind every 5 minutes running the country?  Or do you want someone who isn't scared to use force to protect us, our families and our children.  You people who gave this movie 5 stars are pathetic.  Oh yes, I'm a Democrat, and I'm voting Bush.
0553573403|5.0|I read all three books in the series back to back.  They were all equally fantastic and interesting.  They are books about kings, lords, and knights.  There is a sprinkling of magic and monsters but mostly, this series is about the human struggles.
6305428271|2.0|Dangerous Minds (John N. Smith, 1995)<br /><br />That longtime director John N. Smith has such an anonymous name is a kind of poetic irony, in that no one remembers any of his films. Except, that is, Dangerous Minds, and the only reason they remember that one is because it has a really great main title, supplied by Coolio (Billboard chart-topper \\"Gangsta's Paradise\\").<br /><br />You've seen this movie a thousand times before; that it's based on a more recent piece of nonfiction does not in any way downplay it's overt similarities to movies going all the way back to Boys Town. Louanne Johnson (Michelle Pfeiffer, the movie's real gem) is an ex-drill sergeant in the Marines taking on her toughest assignment: a class full of troubled high school kids. Her ally is old friend Hal Griffith (Law and Order's George Dzundza, who does what he can with what he's got, which isn't much), and her enemy is the school principal, George Grandey (Law and Order: Criminal Intent's Courtney B. Vance), who despite being based on a nonfictional character is the essence of the two-dimensional Evil Nemesis(TM). Caught in the middle are the kids themselves, whom Johnson is forced to manipulate into wanting to learn. Some of the kids (most of whom were acting in their first film, and have not acted since) give surprising turns of flair in this movie, but in all honesty they're not enough to warrant going out of your way to watch this. Andy Garcia (cast for the movie, but whose scenes were cut before release) may have been able to spice this up; he steals every film he appears in, or did back when this came out. As it stands, it's something you've seen so many times before that by the very predictable end, you find yourself asking \\"is that really all there is?\\" **
B0001I561E|4.0|In the best attempt at emulating the traditions of the studio's all time great features, Walt Disney's \\"Aladdin\\" recants the tales of the Arabian Nights in typical musical style. The story concerns a young, devilishly handsome Middle Eastern street urchin, Aladdin (voiced by Scott Weinger) and his desire to be anything but what he is. Desiring to romance the feisty feminist of the royal house, Princess Jasmine (Linda Larkin), Aladdin soon discovers himself in a heap of trouble at the hand of the Grand Vizier Jafar (Jonathan Freeman). All seems lost until Aladdin stumbles upon the mythical cave of wonders - a fabulously wealthy cavern inhabited by the fast-talking, sharp-shooting jack of all genies (Robin Williams).  <br /> <br />Saddle-bagged with the inheritance of the Disney tradition, directors, Ron Clements and John Musker, are desperately grappling to find either a hit film or, at least, hit song (a la \\"The Little Mermaid\\" or \\"Beauty & The Beast\\"). But more often than not the film digresses into mere homage or parody of Disney's previous efforts. Consider the parallels in musical styling between `A Whole New World' (Aladdin) and `Kiss The Girl' (The Little Mermaid) or the Genie's Busby Berkeley-esque `Friend Like Me' in juxtaposition with `Be Our Guest' (Beauty & The Beast). In concocting his performance as the Genie, the animators fall back on parodying everyone from Ed Sullivan to Pinocchio. Ironically, the Genie emerges as the most fully realized character in the film. Famed Warner contract player, Conrad Veidt was the inspiration for the villainous Jafar. Yet Jafar is more a caricature or copying of Veidt rather than a stand alone menacing force of evil as say \\"Sleeping Beauty's\\" Maleficent. Gilbert Gottfried provides an attractive diversion as Iago, Jafar's parrot, but here a comparison in both animation style and character structure is too obvious with the loony goony sea gull (voiced by Buddy Hackett) from \\"The Little Mermaid.\\" Thus the sum totem of Aladdin is more as a clap-trap of previous Disney efforts, rather than its own unique and engaging film experience.  Some might recall that the film's score came under scrutiny from Islamic fundamentalists who felt that the line \\"they cut of your nose if they don't like your face; it's barbaric but, hey, it's home\\" falsely represented their cultural identity as a whole as crude and foreboding. The line was eventually altered on video copies to read, `where it's flat and immense and the heat is intense; it's barbaric but hey, it's home.\\" <br /> <br />Disney DVD delivers a very pleasing anamorphic presentation. Colors are extremely bold and vibrant. Black and contrast levels are deep, rich and solid. The vibrancy of the image is to be admired.  There are no age related artifacts and very few digital anomalies for a picture that is remarkably smooth.  The audio has been cleaned up and remixed to 5.1 surround. It's aggressive and powerful, delivering a thrill ride experience in your living room that few live action sound mixes of late have been capable of rivaling. Extras include several thorough and interesting commentary tracks, an all too brief making of that is definitely geared more toward the under 13 category, some child's play vignettes and some DVD-rom junket materials that, quite simply, you can do without.    <br />
0783225849|5.0|The American Film Institute recently listed the top 100 suspense films of all time.  Topping the list was Alfred Hitchcock's \\"Psycho\\".  This shouldn't be surprizing for those who saw the movie back in the 1960's.  It was a shocking movie that had a lot of people whispering about what they experienced in watching it.  I was considered too young to see it back then (before films ratings) and so, in latter half of the decade, I was looking forward to watching it on TV.  Alas, the previously announced television premier of the movie was cancelled.  My mother said that there had been a murder of the daughter of a prominent politician recently and this caused it to be pulled as a matter of proper respect.  Whatever the reason, I cite the event as a comparison of movie content then and now.  What you see in \\"Psycho\\" is far less graphic than the standard horror film of today yet its' impact is greater that just about anything that came before or since.   <br /> <br />The reason for this is that the film was put together by the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock.  Rather than list the numerous examples of his talent on display, just consider the signature scene of the movie; the murder in the shower.  Here we have a prominent starlet of the era, Janet Leigh, being filmed while taking a shower.  That would probably raise a few eyebrows (or eyelids) even today.  However, we all sensed that something bad was going to happen.  The cuts to the house in the background and the partially audible voices arguing over the girl gave us a clue.  Even though we were on the edges of our seats, the attack still came as a shock.  I don't want to describe it too much although most of us have already seen that scene numerous times.  The series of camera shots alternating in a strobe-like effect kept us mesmerized.  The grating, alarming music that accompanied the sudden entrance of the assailant followed by the slow but steady ping of the shower curtains being pulled down, the glass-eyed stare of a dying woman, the blood mixing in with the shower water circling around as it goes down the drain symbolizing life itself draining away...  This was a whole heck of a lot in one rather brief moment on film.  We had a sense that we had seen everything yet the skill of the director and cameraman made sure that we didn't see too much.  This was one of the great scenes in cinematic history.   <br /> <br />It isn't just about that one scene either, this is a very compelling psychological horror movie.  The plot draws us in and once the suspense begins, it stays for quite a while.  The ending is fascinating too.  Simon Oakland's summation of what we had all just witnessed was a pretty good scene in itself.   <br /> <br />If you haven't seen this movie then make sure you don't miss it.  The standards of Television today being what they are, you won't miss any of the scenes or dialogue no matter what channel you watch it on.  But don't let that fool you, this is still a very scary movie.
B000005S0I|4.0|For a debut album, especially that of a three piece, this is brilliant. Working within the tight constraints of guitar,  bass,  drums and vocals, this actually comes off very well, despite its all over the place sound ( it reminds me of a K-tel compilation in its diversity ). Even the novelty cover of Foxy Lady, with its almost smug \\" rock is dead\\" deadpan vocal  delivery, is amusing, if nothing else.
0684833395|4.0|Catch-22 was written by Joseph Heller.  The book was excellent.  It was a novel that showed the bad side of war.  It starts out with the protagonist of the story Yossarian, in World War 2.  Yossarian may be fighting in the war but he disagrees with it all the way.  He tries to get out of the army anyway he can.  He first tries to fake sick, but then that fails.  He then tries to change the bombing map but that only worked for a little time.  All of these things just delay his bomb runs.  He later finds out that one of the officiers has raised the number of bomb runs so he runs back to the hospital again.  Thats why the book is so great.  He tries so hard to get out of the army.  I would definately recommend this book to anyone who likes war stories, or just wants a great book to read.

B00005JMXX|4.0|A while back some well intentioned film critic wrote about \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" that it was a clear case of a good film mired by bad science. I disagree. \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" is nothing like a `good' film.  You would think that after September 11th America's sick cinematic fascination with its own pulverization would have cooled down. Think again.  Or don't think at all. That certainly works for director, Roland Emmerich and his new apocalyptic claptrap, \\"The Day After Tomorrow.\\" I am still trying to glean the Freudian logic behind his twisted fetish for destroying New York City. If you recall, Emmerich also relished New York's decimation in \\"Independence Day\\" with aliens standing in for Mother Nature.  <br />\\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" is a weak `star vehicle' for Dennis Quaid who makes the least of his role as Jack Hall, a climatologist that nobody believes.  Sela Ward is his estranged wife who, true to Hollywood clich, melts like an ice cap after `hero' husband rescues their resourceful son. Just once I'd like some sane movie executive or screenwriter to explain to me why every couple in a disaster film embark as spiteful enemies but finish out the final reel like a twittering pair of reconciled love bunnies.  Presumably there's nothing like a billion tons of snow to bring two stubborn and evasive soul mates together. At last, something colder than their temperaments.  <br /> <br />There's an absence of `good' sense in the way Emmerich allows all of his plot threads to ball up into minor and bothersome sequences of melodrama that play second fiddle to the special effects. For example, when self-sacrificing Laura Chapman (Emmy Rossum) gets blood poisoning from a leg wound she sustained while trying to save a South African mother and child from the raging flood waters (gee, why couldn't Emmerich have had the directorial huts-bah to go all out and make them quadriplegics too if he was going for the sympathy vote?) and is held up with a fever and chills in theNew York Public Library, her impish but studly would-be boyfriend, Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) treks out to the Russian freighter in search of the penicillin that will save her life. But the administering of the drug is not the central issue of the sequence, so much as it serves as the spring board for a drawn out chase in which Sam and his loyal friends are almost mauled by a pack of ravenous wolves - eat your heart out, Farley Mowat!    All this schlock and `no - sense' would make perfect `movie' sense if Emmerich's intentions of creating a `message' picture were not staked out in two feeble tack-on's: (1) that man is killing himself through his own stupidity and, for lack of a better explanation, needs to get in touch with his feminine side and become a kinder, gentler animal on and to this planet, and (2) that fossil fuels are bad. Well, duh!  <br /> <br />If you're still interested in owning this film, Fox DVD delivers a pretty impressive looking image and sound quality. The anamorphically enhanced picture is beautifully rendered, with deep stylized colors, rich hues and rich, solid blacks. Contrast levels are just low enough to mask the rather obvious digital effects that, at least in the theater, looked very \\"cut and paste\\" and cartoon-like. Edge enhancement is present but does not distract. The audio has an incredible kick in the base and a very natural sounding spread. Extras include two audio commentaries (neither particularly engaging), a sound demo and DVD-Rom junkets that, frankly, are a waste of your time. <br />
B000002LCI|2.0|How this broke DM in the USA I will never figure. To my estimation, as a longtime fan and follower, there are  4 good  songs on this 14 song cd, hardly what I would call a stellar average. To put it in  perspective -  better than A Broken Frame, but not as good as Some Great reward.
B00005JMJG|4.0|The first 17 minutes or so of the movie shows Joel (Jim Carrey) waking up...going to work...and then freaking out. He has this sudden urge to rush to Montague (I'm not sure where that's at though). Joel is not the kinda of person that is spontaneous like that. But for some reason...he just has to go to Montague. He gets to a beach and sees a pretty girl in an orange sweater with blue hair. Being shy..he doesnt talk to her. But she notices him. When he is leaving Montague he notices that the girl is on the train with him now. The girl comes over and starts talking to him and introduces herself as Clementine (Kate Winslett). They hit it off and spend the whole day together having a great and wonderful and exciting (especially for Joel) time.<br /><br />Then the title credits start to appear and Joel is crying his eyes out. We come to find out that when he goes into the store where Clementine works, she is completely ignoring him. So Joel is crushed and then his friends let him know what really happened. She erased him. Erased him from her mind. He's gone to her. So he's devastated and wants to do the same to her.<br /><br />And that's when the real movie begins in my opinion. As the doctor begins to erase his memories, Joel is remembering most of them at the same time. So he's witnessing his memories dissapearing right before him. We come to find out that he's had a long relationship with Clementine. One that seemed like it was really fun and had so much love with the occasional arguing that most couples in love have. As Joel is remembering and actually living out these memories again, he realizes he screwed up and he doesn't want to lose Clementine forever. So he tries to wake up but cant. So he does the next best thing... he tries to hide her in memories that she shouldn't belong in. All the while you are sitting and watching their relationship from Joel's memories and you just want to wake him up yourself and send him off to get Clementine back.<br /><br />This is not your typical love story. I found the love that Clementine and Joel share much more believable in this movie. They are opposites from each other. Joel is shy and Clementine is outgoing. Joel makes plans and Clementine is spontaneous. Joel is careful of his actions and Clementine is carefree. They both helped each other out. Clementine would help Joel have more fun in life, while Joel would help Clementine calm down just a tad. Many love stories have the same plot and the same fairy tale feel to it. This one didn't.<br /><br />The reason why I give this movie a 4 and not a 5 is that there were some things in the movie that I just thought were getting in the way. I didn't like Kirsten Dunst's role between her and the main doctor. I thought the way the movie ended was definitley cool, but I still wish I coulda seen more.<br /><br />I think everyone should at least watch this movie once. Especially if you are in love or have been in love.>This is not your typical love story. I found the love that Clementine and Joel share much more believable in this movie.

B00005ASHM|2.0|I just don't get the hype over this album.  It's got a few good songs, but that's about it.
B000002GVO|5.0|\\"Hotel California.\\" Possibly the only people who have never heard that song are hermits who have been sequestered away in caves for the last thirty years. Don Henley and Glen Frey's scathing allegorical indictment of the lifestyle of California in general (and Tinseltown in particular) is arguably one of the greatest rock songs of all time. It has everything: incisive, evocative lyrics (\\"...warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air\\"), soaring harmonies, and the most famous tandem guitar solo in history, courtesy of the lightning fingers of Joe Walsh and Don Felder. <br /> <br />The title track alone would be sufficient to secure this CD's status as a classic, but it doesn't stop there. \\"Hotel California\\" is followed up by the one-two punch of a pair of the Eagles' biggest songs, \\"New Kid In Town\\" and \\"Life In The Fast Lane,\\" then by \\"Wasted Time,\\" a poignant ode to regret. \\"Victim of Love\\" is next, a less-than-complimentary interrogation of a member of the opposite sex. This precedes one of Joe Walsh's prettiest tunes, \\"Pretty Maids All In A Row.\\" The high harmonies that close out this song are ethereally gorgeous. Randy Meisner's swan song as an Eagle, \\"Try And Love Again,\\" is a minor disappointment. It's a very good tune; unfortunately, it suffers in comparison to the rest of the set. <br />\\"Hotel California\\" closes out with one of the Eagles' best and most underrated songs, \\"The Last Resort.\\" Don Henley points an accusing finger at those who would wreak havoc and destruction on the environment with unbridled development, and there's no question on where he stands. He sings, \\"Some rich man came and raped the land, nobody caught him. Put up a bunch of ugly boxes, and, Jesus, people bought 'em!\\" Succinct and to the point, Henley has never been one to mince words. His songwriting skills, and those of his partner, Glen Frey, have always been one of the Eagles' major strengths. <br /> <br />\\"Hotel California\\" might be the quintessential American rock album. If nothing else, it's a good answer to the perennial question, \\"If you could only take one CD along with you on a desert island, which one would it be?\\" <br /> <br />\\"Hotel California\\" is my answer, anyway.
B0000931QR|4.0|Like Duran Duran and the Go Go's, this group's music is fun to listen to without having to think too much.  It's perfect road trip music.    (...) This album has as much to do with salsa and merengue as rock has to do with chamber music.  They're entirely different genres (...).
0440416027|5.0|Michael is living in a stage of upheaval and transition in his life: his parents have just moved to a rather derelict house, his unnamed baby sister is drastically ill, and the house is often visited by `Doctor Death', the doctor sent to check up on his sister. On top of this, he now has to bus for school; the previous occupant of the house was dead for a week before anyone found him, and the outside garden is a wilderness. The garage in particular is a nightmare - slumping over, filled with junk and dead creatures, and liable to fall over any second. But Michael decides to have a peek inside, and finds an amazing discovery...<br /><br />What is the strange creature hidden beneath the cobwebs and the dead flies? Is it a human, a bird or something else entirely? Calling itself Skellig, the strange being seems near death, and Michael longs to help it, feeling that in some strange way its fate is wrapped up with the fate of his baby sister. He befriends the girl living next door, Mina, who does not attend school due to her mother's belief that school stifles children's creativity, and soon the two have plans to move Skellig to the house across the road which is inhabited only by birds.<br /><br />As his baby sister deteriorates and the family is thrown into worry and turmoil, Skellig begins to make progress, leading Michael once more to the question - what exactly is this strange creature, and can he do something -anything - to help the baby?<br /><br />It is a rare book that can tell what seems to be such a simple story in such a clear, yet intoxicating way. Told in first-person narrative by Michael, David Almond effortlessly creates the point of view of a young boy in a gritty, realistic world. The language and behaviour in particular is wonderful - you can really see real people speaking and acting in the ways that he describes, and the interaction with Skellig is so natural that you have no trouble believing Michael's words.<br /><br />On reading it for the second time, I also realised that not a single word is wasted in the telling of this tale - every single one serves a purpose in connecting the ideas and themes that Almond shapes together. From evolution and science to faith and miracles, to blackbirds and owls, to love and friendship - each are closely entwined together to make a complete whole. Such a complex melding of ideas and possibilities told in such an impossibly simple way, a complete lack of sophistication and yet so much depth and meaning is not something you'll find in just any children's book. I say again: not a single word is wasted.<br /><br />Sad and joyful, poignant and funny, thought provoking and mysterious - the only book that I could possibly compare it to is \\"The Owl Service\\" by Alan Garner. The two authors seem to have the same style and techniques - telling the reader only what they need to know and letting them discover the rest for themselves. And what is discovered are endless possibilities for humanity, life - and yes, even death. The winner of both the Whitbread Children's Book of the Year and the Carnegie Medal certainly counts for something, and this deceptively slim novel certainly deserves more than one read and a permanent place on the bookshelf.e second time, I also realised that not a single word is wasted in the telling of this tale - every single one serves a purpose in connecting the ideas and themes that Almond shapes together.

B0001I561E|5.0|In 1992, Disney got their wish with the splendid animated blockbuster \\"Aladdin\\". In the kingdom of Agrabah, street-wise Aladdin dreams of a better life and falls for the spirited Princess Jasmine. With the help of the wise-cracking Genie of the Lamp (voiced by Robin Williams), Aladdin becomes a dashing rich prince to win Jasmine's hand but the sinister Jafar plots to use the power of the Lamp to rule the kingdom. \\"Aladdin\\" is pure crowd-pleasing family entertainment. The thirty-first Disney animated feature became an instant favorite with critics and audiences in 1992, and one of Disney's highest grossing films with over $500 million worldwide. \\"Aladdin\\" contains an enchanting story, memorable characters, great humor and a marvelous music score. The voice cast is wonderful with Robin Williams delivering an over-the-top comic performance. Its animation is colorful and often quite breathtaking. The animated film won two Academy Awards (Original Music Score and Best Song).<br /><br />\\"Aladdin\\" Special Edition is a welcome addition to your Disney DVD collection. The animated blockbuster is presented in 1.66:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The 2-Disc special edition contains an outstanding picture quality with great resolution and bright colors. Its Dolby Digital 5.1 sound is quite dynamic. Its supplemental features include two separate audio commentaries with filmmakers and animators, 20 minutes of deleted songs and scenes, theatrical trailers, amusing interactive games, music videos, multiple behind-the-scenes featurettes and the revealing 110-minute \\"The Making of Aladdin\\" documentary. With its great presentation and worthy supplements, \\"Aladdin\\" scores an admirable \\"A\\".
B0002234LS|4.0|Secret Window brings to the screen an adaptation of another of Stephen King's books; this one about a series of crimes that take place in the life of author/writer Mort Rainey, played by Johnny Depp. <br />Though not a masterpiece, Secret Window is a good movie, guaranteed to provide an evening's entertainment.  The casting is very good, and the story very well written. <br />Nevertheless, it lacks that something to put it over the top.  After seeing The Others and The Sixth Sense, it becomes a bit predictable, though Stephen King has not lost his touch in providing an unexpected ending. <br />In addition, there is a slight hint of Misery in the Secret Window, what with the writer/author in the middle of nowhere and all. <br />Overall, it is a movie definitely worth watching, even though you might not want to go the extra mile and purchase it. <br />
0385508417|4.0|What a writer. This book was so cute, so enjoyable, and has been my \\"Christmas\\" coffee table book for the last few years.<br /><br />This book will take no more than an afternoon to read, but will tickle your funnybone for a good while.<br /><br />What an amazing writer, I for one have enjoyed each and every book by Mr. Grisham.<br /><br />I am really enjoying his change of subject matter from book to book these days, and I find it amazing his talent can adjust for such a wide range of storylines.<br /><br />Can't wait to see what he'll do next!!
0316666343|4.0|First off, let me say that anyone who has a daughter, and even an ounce of empathy, will find this book physically painful to read.  That said, it is a beautifully written, very poignant story of a young girl's murder, yes, but even more about the effect that crime has on her family.  The narrative voice is that of the girl from \\"heaven\\" or the \\"afterlife,\\" as she recalls her life and watches as life moves on for those left behind.  To be honest, I found the end a bit facile and silly, but still, overall, I would recommend this book to any serious reader.
B00005JNEI|4.0|A foreword; Bush is a wimp, liar, cheat, thief, war-dodging scumbag who should be indicted and impeached on multiple fronts for his crimes while in the Oval Office. <br /> <br />That's what I thought BEFORE I watched this movie.  When it came out, I was glad to see so many people turning out to watch it.  It wasn't that long ago a poll showed 79% of Americans approved of Bush's overall performance as President.  It frustrated me to see so many of my fellow citizens, intelligent and otherwise, being taken by this Administration's fear-mongering tactics as an excuse to invade Iraq. <br /> <br />Michael Moore presents a blistering documentary of the Bush Family's crooked past and present. If only 10% of the allegations are true, George W. Bush deserves to be impeached.  Moore is a courageous man for putting out such a film, in spite of death and censorship threats from the wonderful, caring Republicans; not the kind of people I want running this country. <br /> <br />Remember to vote!
076790592X|5.0|It is a great book that accurately delivers its purpose - inspires people to look at life in a different light.  Fortunately, the author is capable of delivering this complex message with such a simple language.  I recommend others to read it, even high school students.   <br /> <br />In my point of view, Morrie is a wise man.  However, i doubt all his advices are suitable to everyone and useful only at different stages in life.  All men need to work and find his own meaning in life.  The most important lesson Morrie gives us it to love our life and be able to answer this question in our death bed, \\"did we live a meaningful life?\\"
0375422889|4.0|...but still an important story.  I'm interested in reading further about this author's life, but this story didn't hit me as hard as the first book did.
B00005RG6B|5.0|This is the top \\"concept album\\" ever conceived, PERIOD! Pink Floyd obviously ranks up there too, but as far as political content, thought provoking,dramatic, consuming, enthralling, enveloping entertainment, this DVD is the PINNACLE. All of the band is in their best form,,,Tate puts every ounce of energy into every note! You can feel the emotion of the show just as you were there! I got to see the original live, and am going to this tour on the 15th of Oct. Having worn out the VHS version of this concert, it is great to have the DVD version now!! GET IT! You won't be disappointed!
B0002OERI0|5.0|First off, let me begin by saying that I listen to pretty much every genre of music (from classical to metal) and that lately I've been in a really big Indie mood.  Recently my tastes have been of a Postal Service or Death Cab for Cutie flavor, however with American Idiot, Green Day has captured my attention. (Not to mention constant play on my iPod).  With this album, Green Day has made their opus.  From the title track \\"American Idiot\\" to the final act in \\"Whatsername\\" Green Days is able to bring the listener the closest to aural bliss that has been achieved in this day of pop infested radio and tv.  For those of you that think American Idiot is an anti-american album/title track...please, read something other than Teen magazine, and watch something other than Mtv.  They are mearly commenting on the state of America and the American.  I highly recommend this album to anyone.
B00018D3RI|5.0|As a child of the 70's and being ten years old when Starsky & Hutch started on TV I grew up watching it and it is very clear to me that most people who were kids when this show started had more open minds about it and appreciated it a lot more than the professional critics who hated this show and lets face it most of them were kind of old and set in their ways and they seemed to hate everthing that kids liked anyway, a whole big geneation gap thing. Anyway I loved this show as a young girl and I had crushes on both David Soul and Paul Michael Glaser and I still love this show and I recommend the first season DVD!
B00003CXCT|3.0|...I still wish you could get these films restored as seen in 1977 (and so.)  I don't mind the re-makes so much, but I miss the originals and my VHS tapes are wearing out.
B00006CXXU|4.0|There is not one word that can encompass the power, the emotions, and the strength of Christina Aguilera on her most recent album, Stripped. She begins the album with an introduction that entails audio clips of the recent rumors about her. Once the clips pass, she introduces herself with apologies - apologies for not being perfect, for \\"breaking the mold\\", for \\"speaking her mind.\\" She states that this album is her with no \\"pretenses - it's just stripped.\\"  <br /> Primarily, this tiny woman is a power box, not only with her compelling voice, but with her lyrics. She has no problem bashing a few people that have harmed her in the past. The opening song on the album, \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\", is directed to the rapper, Eminen, who openly insulted Aguilera on a song. She holds no inhibitions by stating, \\"It's sad you only get your fame through controversy / But now it's time for to come and give you more to say.\\" Furthermore, on the song \\"I'm OK\\" she sings about her father. In this ballad, she speaks about her childhood and the mental and physical pain her father inflicted upon her and her family. \\"Bruises fade father but the pain remains the same / ... And every morning that I wake I look back at yesterday / And I'm OK,\\" she sings, while crying. Her wailing, tears, and the solitary instrument used (the guitar) join in unison while she quivers to say \\"I'm OK.\\" It is a song that brings you to tears and allows you to feel for her because her family was able to overcome domestic abuse.  <br /> Moreover, there are so many diverse qualities of this album that blend together extremely well. She has different beats and mixes from almost all spectrums of music. In the song \\"Fighter\\" she sings about a cheating lover alongside the sexy sounds of Dave Navarro's electric guitar (guitarist from Jane's Addiction).  The very next song is a variety of Spanish beats; even the chorus includes Spanish lyrics (possibly, to add more authenticity to it). Another collaboration on the album is with Alicia Keys on the track \\"Impossible\\". In this love ballad, Alicia Keys' piano skills are put to good use as Aguilera states the impossibilities of love. In addition, she does not exclude the Hip-Hop community; in her song \\"Dirrty\\" she borrows Redman's beats and raps to give the song a beat that you can dance to.  <br /> Essentially, this album can be for all music lovers. If you are eclectic and like the distinct beats, this album is for you. If you like powerful, inspirational lyrics, this album is for you. If you just like putting the music on full-blast and singing along, this album is for you, as well.  <br />
068987474X|1.0|Mr. Behrendt writes a book and makes money by telling us what we really already know: some guys are afraid of commitment, some can't express their feelings.....\\"Men are From Mars and Women are From Venus\\" does this much better PLUS it tells us how we can learn to communicate with our men. If you want validation for your suspicions of why your relationship didn't work out with your dream guy, this might be worth a read....but read it off the shelf in the bookstore. It's funny but not worth the money. Don't spend the $.
B0002DRDBE|5.0|Kudos to Mr. Smith. This 10th anniversary edition has everything for the fans. And while Kevin may enjoy opining on the works of George Lucas, thankfully, he isn't emulating him.<br /><br />Case in point:<br /><br />Disc One contains the original version of the film with the classic commentary track from the first DVD release, for purists.<br /><br />Also on the first disc is an animated short about what really happened at the funeral, a short film called Flying Cars featuring Jeff Anderson and Brian O'Halloran (Randal and Dante from Clerks), and all the MTV spots the the terrible twosome Jay and Silent Bob appeared in.<br /><br />Disc Two features the first cut of the film that appeared at Sundance before Mirimax optioned the film and added a new soundtrack. It also features a new commentary track with Kevin and all the usual suspects, and a feature where you can actually watch the commentators rather than the film if you so desire.<br /><br />The third disc sports a ton of extra material, including a bit on the restoration of the film, a documentary on how Kevin became the director we all know and love, the student film by Kevin and Scott Mosier, and a Q&A with the cast and crew for the tenth anniversary. The questions asked at the Q&A were a bit dissappointing, but Kevin and his cohorts maintain their usual level of wit.
B00000I3JO|4.0|...that this album would be a precursor to the whole lounge/downtempo music scene.  I enjoyed it when it first came out in the 80s but it was a bit too mellow for my teenage tastes.  Well, my tastes have matured and I have to say I can appreciate Hats a lot more now.  Definately a soundtrack for an evening when you want to relax in a candle lit room with a martini overlooking the city skyline.  If you don't have that view, then close your eyes because this music will evoke it for you.<br /><br />Pick up a copy and enjoy an early lounge classic.
B000069CWE|5.0|I suppose most Linkin Park fans were frustrated or surprised by the release of a remix album rather than an album of strictly new material.  While I very much enjoyed \\"Hybrid Theory,\\" the album doesn't have a lot of staying power.  I don't mean that it's dated, but rather that it really can be worn out.  The songs simply don't give me that intense feeling that good music can anymore (though they certainly did at one time).  This is why I love \\"Reanimation.\\"  It combines the melodies and lyrics that I liked on \\"Hybrid Theory,\\" then gives them a much harder, hip-hop and electronic edge, with enough guests popping up to keep the album consistently interesting.  All of the guest artists do a pretty good job, especially Chali 2-Na of Jurassic 5 on \\"FRGT/10,\\" Jon Davis on \\"1STP KLOSR,\\" and Stephen Richards on \\"P5HNG ME A*WY.\\"  Are the new titles stupid?  Mostly, but the songs are far more lasting than their original versions.  I'm still listening to \\"Reanimation\\" on a regular basis more than two years later.  I can't say that about \\"Hybrid Theory,\\" which is why I would tell you to pick one or the other.
B00024BHTC|5.0|Nightwish is one of the best neo-classical or pro power metal bands that have ever been in existence.  A lot of people get angry about the inclusion of male vocals.  Why?  They're good!  Tarja's still there.  They didn't get a new vocalist.  It's something new and fun!  And a lot of people have been angry with the lack of operatic vocals (especially on Century Child), well if you ever went to Nightwish.com you would realize it is very difficult to perform operatic vocals, expecially during a 2+ hour live show!  It's something different! <br /> <br />When I popped this album in I was very suprised.  This is easily the heaviest Nightwish album ever.  The crunching guitars, blaring and riffing, grounded my ears to dust.  The male vocals ravaged my senses.  The classical keyboarding from Tuomas annihilated all I believed possible.  And Tarja's heaveanly vocals brought the grace back to evil music.  This is the perfect band and one heck of an album!  Every single member of this band has the most talent that one could ever have in that instrument or vocal area.  Tuomas is easily the best keyboardist, just like Tarja is the best vocalist, operatic OR plain singing. <br /> <br />I say this is worth the import price.  But if you like extras, the American release is going to include many bonus track (ie: unreleased songs and live tracks).  They have treated us Americans nice as we have treated them by seeing them live and buying their excellent Finnish music. <br /> <br />If you like metal, classical music, opera, and emotion, buy this right this minute.  And see them live and support Nightwish and make them feel at home during their first American Tour!
B00005JM1F|4.0|This movie is hilarious.  Will Farrel and Vince Vaughn are top notch actors who play hilarious roles in this movie.  This is definitely a movie that I would own if I were you.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This is a truly amazing album.  For all you conservative losers who have reviewed the album without listening to it, you should be ashamed.  Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against you saying things like that, but you are the true \\"American Idiots.\\"  If you do not even have the courtesy to listen to what someone has to say before putting them down you should be quite ashamed.  You don't have to buy it, just borrow it from a friend, just isten to it.  You may call yourselves patriots because you think every decision the president makes is a good one, but you are not.  As Thomas Jefferson put it, it is not only the people's right, but the people's duty to Rebel againsta bad government.  And, as Ghandi showed, peaceful rebellion is always best.  I support our troops, they have done nothing wong.  They have only obeyed orders, there is nothing wrong with that.  But, this was an unnecessary war called for by a rash leader, who does not think about consequences.  He should not even be in office.  So, for all of you supporters who claim to be Patriots by supporting the president, while burning the Constitution, the single most important document our nation has, you are not Patriots, you are despicable people.  Also, this CD is filled with great music, even minus the Political Schpiel.
B0002DB52M|5.0|This is a movie that all humanity needs to see, because that is what it is about...humanity.  First and foremost the movie takes place on a soundstage with limited props.  One MUST have an open mind (unlike my mom) to watch, enjoy, appreciate, and learn from this movie. <br /> <br />The town of Dogville is set during The Godfather era.  It is a small and secluded town away from all towns.  Grace (Kidman) is on the run from gangsters and finds herself in the town of Dogville and at the mercy of townleader Thomas Edison.  The town agrees to take her in for two weeks, to prove herself, which she does.  She is likened by the town, does works for them, all during the rising threat from police in the search for her. <br /> <br />Eventually the town begins to turn.  Grace is treated like trash.  Men take advantage of her and rape her and then say SHE made the advances.  The women increased hostillity and destroyed possession that she had.  Her workload was increased and she ran away, but was caught.  She was chained up and was continued to be cruely treated, raped, and so on.  Eventually the gangsters come back and Dogville may get a taste of its own horrid medacine. <br />  <br />Many people called this movie Anti-American.  Dogville is supposed to represent America.  I believe that Dogville represents ALL of humanity.  The credits section is very emotional aswell.  They show black and white snapshots of the horribly poor side of America set to the music of Young Americans by David Bowie.  Excellent movie that can be related by everyone.  This should be required viewing by all.
B00005V9QJ|5.0|Sade's live album was just superb!  I played it over and over two years ago!  I bought the live DVD earlier this year and love it too!  She and her band do such a good job balancing the '80s and '90s hits with the newer songs from 2000's \\"Lovers Rock\\" in their live performances from two shows compiled for this album.  Some highlights are No Ordinary Love (which I can't stop playing), Cherish The Day, Sweetest Taboo, Jezabel, Paradise, Somebody Already Broke My Heart, By Your Side, and the way she shrieks Crime in a dramatic, emotional way at the end of Is It A Crime.  This is a live album in the finest way.  Clean, clear sound and production for this album and the live performance!
B0002IVN9W|5.0|If you're put off by the Album Description (\\"Fans of Neutral Milk Hotel, Broken Social Scene, and Roxy Music's first two albums will have a new favorite band\\"), don't be.  Broken Social Scene is as terrible musically as their name.  Every track on this beautiful album is consistent, well-crafted, and overpouring with emotions of happiness, regret, reconciliation, sadness, get-off-your-ass and danceness.  You're gonna love it.  I promise.   <br />
6305428425|3.0|Personally, there's no way that you'd catch me at mine, but I think it's more of an American thing to have reunions anyway. We have proms though, so who knows?  I love this movie though, it's great to watch and relax to.<br /><br />Lisa Kudrow plays ditzy Phoebe, without the hippy-ish clothes. And Mira Sorvino seems to have blonde hair, with a brown thick streak through her fringer for no apparent reason. The brilliant Alan Cumming (Sandy Frink) and Janeane Garofalo (Heather Mooney) also have show stealing roles. You have your sterotypical roles in this: the outcasts, the popular and pretty girls, the football player, the 'nerd', and the anti-social one.<br /><br />With corny dance sequences, and flashback scenes to Romy & Michele's high school days, this film is one of the best high school movies thre is. About every possible cliche you can imagine happens at the reunion, but there's a happy ending. Which is always good. There's no extras on this DVD, so don't expect any.
B00028HBKM|5.0|With every lash, a billion sins were forgiven. This film is only as violent as it needs to be in order to show todays world what  sacrifice is really like. Comparisons to \\"Death Wish\\" and \\"Chainsaw\\" movies are ridiculous. By observing the anguish of Christ, my understanding and appreciation for him is far greater than if I had squeamishly turned away. <br />That other wonderful movie, \\"The Gospel of John\\" is a brilliant portrayal of a complete gospel with fantastic acting and narration.  It shows us the life of Jesus and is a tremendous teaching tool. \\"The Passion...\\" offers us only a fraction of the words of truth and love that Christ has to share.  Instead we are given our first chance to share in the death and sacrifice of our savior spoken in the original languages, which rather than creating a barrier have broken a barrier to realism. <br />If the temple guards are portrayed as brutal, so be it. Why wouldn't they be? If Caiphas and the Pharisees seem unforgiving and enraged, why wouldn't they? As far as they could see, Jesus was guilty of the ultimate blasphemy. <br />This film was inspired and is an inspiration.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I won't ad any description, I think other reviews are great and helpful. <br />The only thing I wanted to share is my disapointment about the packaging of the set. <br />This is a set a lot of people (and more) have been waiting for for a long time. This masterpiece is a jewel in any DVD collection - Lucas Art should have made a better packaging (take the lord of the ring special edition package, for example). <br /> <br />The box is beautiful, with nice embossing, but made on thin cardboard stock, that will not resist a long time, I am sure. The DVD sleeves look really \\"Cheap\\" an the selection of the art, paintings and drawings used on them very poor. <br /> <br />So in conclusion, these dvd are of course a must have, and deserve their 5 stars raiting, but the packaging is HORRIBLE, CHEAP, and deserve a minus 5 stars. It was a disapointment - really.
B0002OERI0|4.0|i'm an old school green day fan. i love kerplunk!, dookie, insomniac, what have you. in fact, i once had a band based almost exclusively on green day's influence. but let's face it: they have sucked lately. warning was so disappointing, the greatest hits album was cliche, and i was very much afraid that green day had sold out for good. i was so relieved when i bought this album and it was actually good. the political aspect of the album is actually quite lacking and it's sorta cliche. i think they just wanted to prove themselves a bit to the punk crowd. but musically, the album takes me back to the kerplunk! days. 'american idiot,' 'holiday,' and 'jesus of suburbia' show that they can still rock, while songs like 'boulevard of broken dreams' and 'wake me up...' show the more mature side of green day's music that has always been there. if you liked this band before they sold out, or if you thought warning was the greatest album ever, and you want to know what green day used to be like, get this album.
B00005JNEI|5.0|I haven't been able to watch more than local news since September 12, 2001.  What little I know of what's going in in the world is from the newspaper, which can be very one-sided. <br />Michael Moore showed another side.  This movie covers possible conspiracies behind the attacks on the United States in 2001, and different political connections between our country and Bin Laden, and it also discusses the effects on our soldiers and on the people back home. <br />There's far too much in this movie to go into any review.  If you don't want to own it, rent it.  It's one of the most important things you'll see.  Even if you hate it and disagree with everything that's in it, Farenheit 911 will evoke emotions in you that will help you to make up your mind for the upcoming election if you haven't already.
B00000JLWW|5.0|The movie is great, but the DVD is not in true widescreen format.  I wonder when will Paramount release a 16x9 anamorphic (1.85:1) DVD version.
B0002I831S|5.0|I was in seventh grade when Star Trek (the Original Series) aired for the first time on Thursday night.  I have never forgotten watching that first episode (\\"The Man Trap\\") because truly, nothing like it had ever been on either television or for that matter the movie theaters, before.  From the first few moments, we all knew that something new and very special was being unveiled before our eyes.<br /><br />After all these years, the original series (first season) still does not disappoint.  The magic is still there, despite the fact that the special effects are no longer cutting-edge, the uniforms are totally sixties, etc.  Many of the episodes are still classics, such as City on the Edge of Forever, The Cage, Balance of Terror, and many others.  Many of the best episodes of first season have a wonderful \\"New Frontier\\" feeling about them--the viewer truly is transported to a wonderful new era in which mankind is just beginning to really master space travel and explore the Galaxy.  The fact that the crew and cast were truly multi-racial suggested that mankind had solved many of its problems on planet Earth and was now turning outwards.  At a time (1966) of racial unrest and the Vietnam War, this was a wonderful message.  \\"The Cage\\" in particular captures this feeling, but several other episodes do so as well.  In fact, in my opinion one of the things lacking in the third season was that the series began to lose that feeling of \\"newness\\" as regards man's exploration of the galaxy.<br /><br />Almost all of the first season's episodes are excellent--there aren't really any bad ones unless you want to count The Alternative Factor as one.  That makes this DVD collection a real bargain.<br /><br />The DVDs come packaged in a clunky yellow plastic case which I guess is supposed to kind of resemble a Tricorder or something.  Personally I found the case annoying because it does not easily fit on a DVD shelf.  Inside is a plastic multiple-DVD plastic jewel case which is more practical, but also more fragile.  A tougher shelf-friendly jewel case would have been a better decision, in my opinion.<br /><br />The user interface to the episodes is pretty good--I found it easy to operate, and it is nice that they included the original trailers--this makes it easy to quickly reference what each episode is about if one cannot recall by the title.  Some of the other extras are interesting, although not all.  Opinions will surely differ on this.<br /><br />For me, this was a must-have.  To get the whole first year of the series in one place at a reasonable price is something I've wanted since the series came out in 1966!is more practical, but also more fragile.

B000003CMB|5.0|The best live album ever.  It's hard to believe this was recorded over 30 years ago.  The music is better than anything going on today.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Saw it in a theater-the quietest fully-occupied theater I've ever been in. Gripping, emotional, thought-provoking. When it was over, one woman (an avowed Republican) asked if it was possible that it was all true. Then she answered her own question, \\"Even if just one thing was true, it's enough.\\"
B0000035E7|4.0|Every song on this album is great, but its really hard to say how good it iis when the production is so bad that you can barely understand it. Kurt and co. only spent just over $600 to pay for the recordings, not a good idea. However as bad as the production may be there are very many redeeming qualities to this album. The song 'About a Girl' is a perfect example of this CDs importance, the riff may be hard to hear but the lyrics are true and the drumming is good. This is overall a great album, so why does it get only 4 stars? Because of how terrible the production is (You've probably figured that out by now). When the box set comes out I hope it has 'Bleach' remastered.
B000002A33|5.0|This has to be Screaming Trees best production ever, why did they have to end at this point of progress......I have no idea. They were on the right track and this album proves it. Mark has his own distinct voice and the music to back it up is their absolute best. Out of all their albums for New listeners, buy this one first. Hear what they became before what they were. They were good then but this album displays their talents matured. Another album worthy of *****.

078681859X|5.0|I so enjoyed this book that I don't know quite where to start.  I think the best place is Bartimaeus himself, the somewhat anti-hero demon (or should I say spirit?) who makes the book sing with his personality.  I was constantly laughing at this djinni, as he behaves as much like a slave-demon as I could think of: nasty and uncooperative, ultimately out for freedom.  It is good to see from the view of the slave once in a while, and Bart is a great character to show what the other side feels like.  His disdain for humans (so simple) and remorse at how the entire spirit race is used against their will was wonderfully portrayed. <br /> <br />Second, Nathaniel.  When needing to see a different side of the coin, one can always count on the way Nat sees things.  Since he and Bartimaeus have dueling points of view, their arguments often show their prejudices very well. <br /> <br />And lastly, the immense amount of reference to myth and legend.  Nods to djinni in magic carpets, or ones captured in lamps; little bits like the demon ring of King Solomon are wonderful.  As a fan of myth, these are placed perfectly throughout the novel.  I am a fan of Lord of the Rings, and will certainly not compare this work to Tolkien's, accept for one way:  they both seem to be influenced by legends, and they both came out with marvelous stories.  Tolkien took to the Icelandic Sagas & Beowulf (good reads for fans of Tolkien) and Stroud took from 1,001 Arabian Nights and the myths of ancient Egypt.  Stroud did not try to imitate Tolkien, for which I am thankful, as too many current authors seem to do this (Christopher Paolinni jumps to mind when thinking of young adult authors with this tactic).  Instead he has taken a similar idea and added his own twist, his own flavor to the tale.  a tale that I think is better than the fairy tales of J.K. Rowling or the meanderings of Jordan.  I completely enjoyed this book, as well as the second, and would recommend both to all lovers of fantasy. <br /> <br />
1594200106|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was a very solid story that grabbed my interest from the cover alone. I saw it in a couple of book stores and read the blurb, then I finaly bought it. As ussual, the book was different than expected, but the tale was wonderful. I was caught by suprise a couple of times at the plot turns but others most likely will find it a little predictable. What was most engrossing however, was the language. The descriptions of the people, the places and the books involved in this novel are mesmerizing and spellbinding; like a symphony of words. Those who love reading for its own sake rather than just for the plot will most likely enjoy this book.
B000005RSF|4.0|Single and Discoteca were released together.  I hated the former and loved the latter.  This has mixes from the better song.  The mixes don't stand out to me, but the b-side \\"confidential\\" is truly touching.  PSB may have made it for Tina Turner to sing, and I can totally imagine her giving her soulful all to it.  It's about one lover promising not to out his gay lover by telling others of their relationship.  It's a rare, underappreciated ballad.  I wonder if it was inspired by autobiographical events.
B00000IL26|1.0|I'm a fun of jazz and I have decent equipment to play it on but I've never waded through this CD to the end. I just couldn't stand the quality of sound. Cymbals are terrible (bleeding ears)and instruments are imbalanced. Please compare some older Davis recordings from Columbia or Bill Evans from Riverside where percussion is much more subtle and refined. I asked my friend, audiophile for judgement. He said \\"its a mess and noise\\". Despite significant upgrades and refinements in my stereo the CD didn't survive in my collectom. I'd say the same about some other RvG Editins (e.g. Cool Struttin' or Blowin' Session). The music itself is not bad, quite energetic but it can't make you tired. Fatigue factor is very, very high in this case.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|This movie is an excellent mix of strong emotions, which range from anger and guilt to love and jealously.  This movie is about a guy (Ashton Kutcher) who blacks out during certain events and cannot remember them.  The Butterfly Effect goes through four kid's childhoods and on to their college years.  The character Kutcher plays is able to go back in the past and alter events. <br /> <br />I had never heard of this movie and am not a big fan of Kutcher but I decided to see this movie.  I was pleasantly surprised. This movie had an excellent storyline, which kept the viewer intrigued. This movie was suspenseful, the acting was great and the characters were well developed. I would recommend watching if you like movies with suspense or time travel. <br />
0385508417|5.0|By page 8, I wanted to skip Christmas myself. Grisham sets the stage for such yearning by describing the commercialism, greed and rudeness found in the crowded days prior to the 25th of December. Told through the eyes of a Christmas weary middle-aged man, he and his wife decide to skip Christmas and go on a cruise, forgoing all the usual obligations of presents, cards, and inside and outside decorations.<br />Nonetheless, Christmas is not so easily escaped. All it takes are a few comical misfortunes and unexpected events to bring everyone back together to celebrate the good stuff about the season. I liked this story, as I do other works by the author. Grisham writes mesmerizing tales, whether they include Frosty the Snowman or not.
B00028HBKM|5.0|There are few words to describe a work of art such as the Passion of the Christ. A classic. A monument. More awe-inspiring than the Sistine Chapel. Worthy to stand beside The Confessions of St. Augustine in terms of pure evangelical power. Truth be told, perhaps no Christian apologist since Apostolic times has ever touched the hearts of as many people as Mel Gibson has with this film.<br /><br />Works of such depth and beauty necessarily rile strong emotions. Few believing Christians will be able to view this film and not weep. Few vehement atheists will fail to recognize the incredible persuasive power of the film and rail against it in the most extreme terms. Few agnostics will be able to view the film and not take a position one way or the other.<br /><br />As a student of Greco/Roman history and culture, I found the film's use of archaic languages utterly spellbinding. As a devout Catholic, I was touched to the core by the film's accurate portrayal of the brutalization and crucifixion of Jesus. I have seen dozens of religious epics, but The Passion of the Christ blows them all away. It sets a new standard for the genre which Hollywood will have a hard time reaching.
B0002IQHY8|1.0|When I heard that a new Parsons album was in the works and would be released in August, I was really excited.  I've been a fan for 20 years and have every album released.  Finally, another album.  Something that would better than the tepid \\"On Air\\" and the disappointing \\"Time Machine\\".  Maybe something that would equal \\"Try Anything Once\\" as one of the greats. <br /> <br />When I bought the album and started listening, I was extremely disappointed.  This thing is awful--nothing like any Parsons album I've ever heard.  The tunes are mind-numbingly repetitious, monotonously similar to each other.  The lyrics have NONE of the clever wording and poetic rhyming that is such a Parsons trademark.   <br /> <br />I didn't even make it to the end of the album--I see other reviewers have played it several times and found that it grows on you.  I can't force myself to listen to it again.  It reminds me of Madonna's \\"Ray of Light\\" album with the mindless computer-generated dance tracks.  I hated that too.   <br /> <br />Ebay, here comes my latest hope for a great Parsons album.  I won't be buying any more of his work without a pre-listen.

Sonny, a hot-head who is difficult to control, but a loving son and caring family man who will ultimately be brought down by his own temper; Freddie, a coward but able businessman with connections in Las Vegas which will help launch the Corleone family into the West and onto an entirely new \\"empire\\"; and of course Michael, the silent and calculating son who will end up leading the family after the Don's death.<br /><br />Some critics claim that Puzo created his own sub-genre (the \\"Eastern\\") when this novel burst onto the literary scene. I tend to agree. I've never read anything quite like it, and it deserves all of the attention it got (the films, the academy awards, the spawning of multiple TV and movie spinoffs like 'The Sopranos', etc.). Other critics have lambasted Puzo's prose for it's simplicity. Although there is some truth to this, I find it hard to imagine the book written any other way! But this isn't what draws the reader in; it's the characters and all of the terrible events they find themselves in. Will they find a way out? Can the families coexist without tearing each other apart? How can you (the reader) both hope that the Corleone family suceeds and cringe when they do by means that are less than appetizing?<br /><br />This is a book that has changed the face of literature and our TV and movie worlds.

B000068FWC|5.0|Several decades ago FM was where all the good music was played.  AM was all pop, hype and commercials.  However, occasionally powerful FM groups crossed from the relative obscurity of FM rock to AM rock, and when they were able to do so while retaining a measure of their artistic values the end result was usually either a killer song or a killer album; \\"Breakfast in America\\" is just such an album.<br /><br />How often do you see reviews raving about how great a song or album is?  Very frequently.  How often does the hype meet reality?  Occasionally.  In the case of this album the creativity and originality are incredibly high.  A harmonica, clarinet, saxophone, piano and a score of other instruments are combined in a completely unique way with the vocals of two strong lead singers and creative lyrics and music to yield a work of musical art that became Supertramp's biggest seller and among their most readily accessible music.<br /><br />The vocal duties throughout the album are shared by Roger Hodgson and Richard Davies.  The voice differences between the two singers provide a unique vocal contrast well-exploited on songs such as \\"Gone Hollywood.\\"  The music is frequently pop, but the lyrics are highly poetic and complex, and rarely evoke throw away pop lyrics.<br /><br />The album spawned four hit singles, \\"The Logical Song,\\" \\"Goodbye Stranger,\\" \\"Breakfast in America,\\" and \\"Take the Long Way Home.\\"  While the songs came across as pop, consider \\"The Logical Song.\\"  The complexity of the music shows its progressive rock influence.  In one place the lyrics are:<br /><br /> There are times when all the world's asleep,<br /><br /> the questions run too deep<br /><br /> for such a simple man.<br /><br /> won't you please, please tell me what we've learned<br /><br /> I know it sounds absurd<br /><br />  but please tell me who I am.<br /><br />Lyrics such as these are far from throw away pop lyrics and remind us of the progressive roots of Supertramp.<br /><br />While every song on this CD is a gem, there are a number of unique moments.  During \\"Goodbye Stranger\\" there is a whistling accompaniment, and the whistling is incredibly pure and beautiful.  The harmonica introduction to \\"Take the Long Way Home\\" is excellent and well-performed.  Very few people would consider the harmonica to be an instrument for a rock song.  There are also several places where Supertramp effectively reminds listeners that the piano is a percussion instrument.<br /><br />As powerful as much of the music is on this CD there are quite a few moments where the instruments are all acoustic and the song is quite mellow.  The introduction to \\"Lord Is It Mine\\" with quiet singing and piano is one excellent example.  Yet the song is decidedly rock.<br /><br />Given that Supertramp started as a progressive rock group, it would have been unusual to create an album without at least one strongly progressive song; \\"Child of Vision\\" is that song.  There is an excellent extended bridge in this seven plus minute song where the background music and piano are in counterpoint, and where the piano is once again effectively used as a percussion instrument.  This song is my favorite from the CD.  However, I enjoy progressive rock and this song is the most clearly progressive song on the CD.<br /><br />There are moments in musical time where a group passes through a creative point where the music matches the sentiment of a broad range of listeners.  Often those moments are when multiple musical styles are combined to create a fresh sound.  \\"Breakfast in America\\" was one of those moments.on this CD is a gem, there are a number of unique moments.  During \\"Goodbye Stranger\\" there is a whistling accompaniment, and the whistling is incredibly pure and beautiful.

Yet the song is decidedly rock. <br /> <br />Given that Supertramp started as a progressive rock group, it would have been unusual to create an album without at least one strongly progressive song; \\"Child of Vision\\" is that song.  There is an excellent extended bridge in this seven plus minute song where the background music and piano are in counterpoint, and where the piano is once again effectively used as a percussion instrument.  This song is my favorite from the CD.  However, I enjoy progressive rock and this song is the most clearly progressive song on the CD. <br /> <br />There are moments in musical time where a group passes through a creative point where the music matches the sentiment of a broad range of listeners.  Often those moments are when multiple musical styles are combined to create a fresh sound.  \\"Breakfast in America\\" was one of those moments. <br />
B000000YG5|5.0|A top ten all time collection of songs in my heart, some of the most fantastic sax on record, hoppingest tunes and heartfelt recording available.  Simply perfect.  I've given five stars to CDs I know are less than perfect, because I love them, but this is pure.  I don't have to tell you all what you already know about Sonny Rollins and this classic release.  We are all lucky Sonny Rollins has stayed with us so long and shared with us so much.  I'd just like to use this public space to thank Sonny again personally for his kindness in taking the time after a fabulous energy-draining virtuoso performance at Kannai Hall, Yokohama, in May '97, to sign this CD and take photos with me and a friend.  These treasures make me proud.  Thank you Sonny.
B00008S2VG|3.0|After listening to \\"American Life\\" for a period of time now, i do have to agree that it doesn't stick with me like most other albums she's released.  And believe me, I have dissected every madonna song and album from the beginning.  I find her vocals extremely robotic at times, her lyrics sometimes cliche and convenient instead of really giving me something to relate to.  I do LOVE \\"love profusion\\", especially the single remixes...wow.  All in all, I find that she has limited herself vocally ever since she trained(vocally) for the Evita Movie.  Remember that raw sound in her voice from \\"Like a prayer\\", 'deeper and deeper\\", 'papa don't preach\\", well a lot of that is shrunken to a blander, more robotic version of the Madonna I once remembered.   I bought the album though, it's always worth the time to experience yet a new era in her musical artistry.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|I would advise anyone with an interest in Greek history to actually see the film before making up their mind about it. Despite very mixed reviews, this film delivers on all levels, if you go into it with the proper expectations. This is not a direct adaptation of Homer's Iliad; far from it, in fact. Yet, the heart of Homer is still embedded within. Troy takes the story of the Iliad and looks at it as more of a historical epic, rather than a mythological fairy tale. It's probably closer to what actually happened at Troy, and in turn, it makes for a very personal and moving story. <br />  The acting is great, and the direction is brilliant. Eric Bana steals the show as Hector and Bloom and Pitt do a satisfactory job as Achilles and Paris. Perhaps the best acting job was turned in by Sean Bean though, as the cunning Odysseus. I was amazed by his performance and would love to him star in an adaptation of \\"The Odyssey\\". Peter O'Toole rounds out a powerful supporting cast and theres already pre-oscar buzz surrounding his role as the noble King Priam. If true fans of Homer hesitate to see this movie, they should for the one scene alone where Priam visits Achilles in his tent.  <br />  WIthout giving anymore away, I simply plead with you to give it a chance. Go in open minded and you won't come out dissapointed.
B00000IPAX|2.0|I know! It does not make sense! The used to be pretty good with Dude Ranch and what not but since the other drummer dude guy left and Travis Barker (the only talent in the whole band joined) there music started being terrible pop! Songs off of Dude Ranch like: Degenerate was great just because you could listen to them and laugh your ass off at the same time! With the addition of great new talent I thought they would be better, you know? But hell, they weren't that good to begin with anyway! It's been pretty much all downhill from here for them. Tom, Mark and Travis Show and Take Off Your Pants and Jacket (although I didn't own either of them, I heard enough) were not spectacular either! Their newest self-titled album was OK? But still not so great! Travis would be better off leaving this bands and joining a cool band with a talented vocalist, bassist and drummer. (I don't mean Box Car Racer or he god-awful Transplants). <br /> <br />I can't wait until some kind of change starts happening in the music industry! The music industry people should stop signing anyone who walks in their door and start looking for real talent again. People like Good Charlotte and Simple Plan dominate the radio! Two awful bands that I can't stand! We need to get rid of them and Blink (except Travis) and start making talented bands! Like Velvet Revolver! One of the only talented bands of the decade!  <br />
0804115613|4.0|I loved this story and the characters.  I enjoyed seeing Evelyn grow and change and 'find herself.'  I did think that the whole notion of everyone in a small town in the deep South in the 30's having no problem with two women living together in an unabashedly lesbian relationship was very unrealistic.  I don't think you could expect that reaction even today!  I wish that our world were as perfect as Whistle Stop.  <br /> <br />Overall, a great read and I'm looking forward to trying out the recipes!
B000002JPA|5.0|My first Dream Theater album was \\"Train of Thought\\" which, contrary to what some hardcore fans would tell you, is a very good album. \\"Images and Words\\" is alot different than what you would think from the album cover and title. There are some progressive parts, but there are also some moments that are definitely metal, and together they sound great. <br />1. Pull Me Under 10/10- I was blown away by how heavy this was. A fairly large hit on MTV (heavily shortened to appeal to MTV viewers short attention spans) with lyrics about death, but, unlike most other songs about the subject, these are not about \\"PAIN! SUFFERING! DEATH AND DESTRUCTION!\\" Instead these may be the greatest, most intelligent lyrics Dream Theater has ever done. Outstanding performances by Moore, Petrucci and Labrie. Could have been my favorite song of all time except that the ending is poor; it has heavy riffing but then just ends, like they ran out of tape. <br />2. Another Day 9/10- Was supposed to be the big single off of the album that actually went nowhere. Many fans have a problem with the uplifting lyrics and compare it to Kenny G. except this has a great guitar solo and the sax isn't overused. <br />3. Take the Time 9/10- Has many different parts, similar to Queens \\"Bohemian Rhapsody.\\" The first half is forgettable but picks up in the second part with Petrucci having a guitar section that is possibly the greatest ending of any song ever, second to Guns N Roses \\"November Rain.\\" <br />4. Surrounded 6/10- A ballad that isn't as sappy or sexist as most bands' at the time. Moore again provides decent lyrics, but is ultimately too boring to be memorable. <br />5. Metropolis Part 1 10/10- Many say that this is Dream Theater's best ever; but I disagree. There are many amazing parts to this song; it is definitely one of their top five. The lyrics don't do anything for me though, and certain parts of the instrumental section seem patched together. These are small complaints because this is still an amazing song. <br />6. Under a Glass Moon 10/10- Has a great beginning, with harmonious guitar parts by Petrucci. Portnoy also does a subliminal job at the drums, my only complaint is that the lyrics and ending aren't that great. <br />7. Wait for Sleep 10/10- Short simple song with only piano, keyboard, and Labrie's vocals. Moore again provides thoughful lyrics that go perfectly with the mood that the music is trying to set. <br />8. Learning to Live 8/10- The longest song on the disc starts off great, but slows down during the middle. There is just too much filler instrumentals to keep it interesting, but picks up in the last two or three minutes to have an outstanding finish. <br />According to the liner notes the music is the \\"Images\\" and the lyrics are the \\"Words\\" (hence the title \\"Images and Words\\"). This is truly a groundbreaking album for progressive metal, before this bands like Queensryche and Metallica had showed traces of this, but Dream Theater got the ball rolling. An album that can be appreciated by fans of Progressive Rock, Art Rock, Heavy Metal, or simple \\"rock.\\"
B0002234LS|5.0|I really enjoyed the caracter development as you see Jonny Depp sink into madness. I also loved the ending where we see the rare but exciting ending where the bad guy gets away scott-free. I also liked the creepy ending with him eating the corn from the garden where his murdered wife lay.
B00004RFCM|5.0|This is a classic season.  It brings you back to the begining and lets you remember all the basics of the characters.  It is fun to to watch and see them progress throught out all of the seasons.  Anyone who is a Sex and the City fan, I definitely reccomend getting the first season. It is a must have!
B000056VJ7|3.0|What style is Meat Loaf? Is he a hard rockin' heavy metal star? Or a broadway singer? In my opinion he lies in some odd place in between, which places him in a very unique place in music where no one else is classified.  The music on Bat Out of Hell is very controlled and tightly orchestrated, Meat Loafs vocals are soaring and impressive, but not full of the angst of most hard rock, thus why they are more reminiscent of a broadway singers.  The lyrics themselves are honest and common reflections of teenage rebellion, but is rebellion even the right word? A close look reminds us of Bruce Springsteen, in what is being expressed, perhaps not nearly as eloquent, but effective non the less.  The major flaw in Bat Out of Hell is actually in its over orchestration, it lacks the rawness that normally accompanies the topics which are explored.  But one cannot deny that the solid vocals and orchestration stand up in their own right.  So often the album works against itself from both sides, each detracting from the other, but when viewed individually they are easily appreciated.  I have a hard time deciding between 3 or 4 stars for this album, I want to give it 4 but I think it just slightly falls short.  It is a great work in its own right and highly recommended to anyone who either appreciates great vocal work or simple songs of adolescence.  A fun and nostalgic album.
B000002UAO|5.0|By far the greatest beatles album out there. Every song is great, except what goes on, but everyone makes mistakes. Michelle, In My life, Norweigen Wood and Girl- some of the best beatles tracks, or tracks in general, for that matter. Simply a mind blowing experience, with endless replay value.
B000000W5F|4.0|Funny but as I get older I like music I might have dismissed in youth, this album has some radio friendly tunes, some surprises (Slave!) and one song I heard in a movie soundtrack and had to track it down (Tops.) I have to wonder what Charlie Watts was thinking playing with Sonny Rollins...his true love, jazz and in walks the colossus! This album stretches out what the Stones could do. If you like variety in your music....
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This is a story of two souls as different in their aspects as people can be.  One is a fresh young innocent, just beginning her life and searching for the ideals she is hoping will come with time.  The other is a middle aged man who has \\"been there and done that\\" who knows the realities of the road the innocent will be travelling.  As Da Vinci used to study deformed persons and include them in his paintings, to enhance the beauty of a personal portrait, the director and actors in this film juxtapose the betrayal of youthful innocence (Johansen) confronting the realities of the world, with the hope that comes from the wisdom of a man who has already lived most of his life (Murray).  It is a unique film, a unique plot, and, its climax is a tender scene in which the two lost souls reconcile their disillusioned dreams by sharing their genuine natures, and, their own ways of coping with the vulnerabilities and mortality of the human journey.  It is not a movie for cynics, it is not a movie for harsh realists . . . it is a movie for those who are on life's path, who recognize that blind pessimism is no more real than blind optimism.  It is for those who seek validation that the journey through life is bittersweet, but, that it is a journey worth our trust in our own humanity and the occasional humanity of others.
B00005JNEI|3.0|When watching any Michael Moore documentary, it is very difficult to seperate the politics that inform the film with the actual filmmaking style. Just glancing across the other reviews it is easy to see that he divides people perhaps even more than George W. himself. But are these differences purely down to politics, rather than filmmaking. It would not suprise me to discover that those who so fervently defend the film are Bush sceptics, and those that attack it so vigorously are at least partially behind their president. It is very difficult to make seperate the rhetoric from the technique, but I will aim to do so.       Firstly, I should declare that I am staunchly against the war in Iraq. I have attended a protest march when Bush came to London and have not wavered in my stance. However, I have wavered in my stance on Mr. Moore since seeing his One Man Show at the Roundhouse Theatre, reading his books and seeing his latest documentaries, allied with a bit of background research. And so, with this rather rambling introduction, we come to Fahrenheit 9/11.       Fahrenheit 9/11 is almost a companion piece to Moore's earlier film, Bowling for Columbine, trading on similar themes of fear, misinformation and corporate irresponsibility. However, while Columbine was sprawling, scattershot and taking aim at more targets than an Olympic archer, there is no doubt that Fahrenheit has it's sights set on one prize - Mr. Bush. And boy, does it get ugly.       The film contains copious amounts of footage of Bush appearing stupid, arrogant, insecure, cold and many other negative adjectives. It also attempts to put across the opinion that since 9/11, the Bush administration has used fear to push through a very hardline agenda, culminating with the war in Iraq. Much of this argument is very powerful. Some of it, however, is not.        In one respect, Fahrenheit is one of Moore's more restrained works. He keeps himself off camera much more (some of Columbine's more mawkish moments involved Moore pushing himself as a \\"man-of-the-people\\" at every opportunity, which considering his alleged behaviour at this years' Cannes seems in hindsight a bit rich), and his subject matter is definately more focused, but it also contains some of his most blatantly manipulative work - in particular the scene where the mother of a dead American soldier (who was fighting in Iraq), goes to Washington to protest. When Moore's camera watches as she breaks down, the scene appears to achieve nothing more than make one woman very upset. It is also very crass, insensitive, and devoid of any shred of intellectual argument. Yes, it is very sad that a mother has lost her son, but showing her crying does not automatically make the war wrong. It is also very patronising to assume that the audience cannot comprehend the complexities of the war, and that you have to reduce the entire argument into a purely emotional, and quite crude, stunt.        Having said this, and perhaps unsurprisingly, the film also contains some very powerful sequences, in particular the reconstruction of 9/11 with sound only over a black screen. As with several sequences from Columbine, it sends a shiver down your spine, and reminds you that when he restrains himself, Moore can be a very affecting filmmaker. Another effective moment is some disturbingly frank soldiers discussing their choice of music when going into battle. Suffice to say, it is alarmingly tasteless, and the scene serves as a damning indictment of the mindset of some of the troops.        Another problem arises with the attacks on Bush. As I stated earlier, I find the man a menace to the world - and the footage of him is very masterfully assembled; both funny and frightening in equal measure. However, it is difficult to see how this boils down to anything more than just a personal attack on the President. The man himself is a prime target for such attacks, and they are legitimate, but the film's continuing reliance on this seems toindicate either an unwillingness or an inability to engage with the subject on any kind of advanced intellectual level, and comes across purely as a more sophisticated version of name calling. This again seems a rather patronising over simplification of the issues.         The main problem is the terribly one sided nature of the opinions being aired. Audience's should be given enough credit to judge both sides of an argument and come to their own conclusions. This is obviously not on Moore's agenda, and indeed filmmakers right the way back to Eisenstein have used film to push their particular ideologies, but Moore frequently undermines himself by lurching into ill concieved, borderline extremist tirades. This is made the more frustrating by the fact that he also makes very pertinent points, and is clearly a very gifted filmmaker and producer of propoganda. It is easy, though, to see why many (even Bush haters) find him difficult to stomach, and why many find it easy to dismiss him as a \\"nut\\" or simply ignore him. There are enough right wing nuts out there, so maybe having a few left wing ones is no bad thing. It could be argued, though, that such basic, simplified, and (dare I say it) sometimes inaccurate and purposefully misleading arguments do more harm to the cause than good.        Overall, Fahrenheit is another solid, well constrcuted, frequently funny, and sometimes moving film from Moore. However, it's arguments are extremely light weight and one sided, and it is by no means Moore's best work (Columbine, despite it's lack of focus is much more compelling; and Roger and Me remains his masterpiece). If you want a masterclass in propoganda - then this is the film for you. If you want a well thought out, balanced, intelligent and well informed argument, then you would be best advised to look elsewhere.
B000092ZYX|5.0|An extremely political album, as much of Radiohead's work tends to be, Hail to the Thief is another example of the concept album being stretched to its limits.  Simply put, it is a concept album without a concept.  In many ways, the theme is that life is a plethora of experience, from up to down, manic to depressive, anger to passivicity.  This is emphasized strongly by the album art, which seems to spring out of pop art movements in the mid twentieth century.  The album is not the rock album that Bends or OK Computer was, nor is it in the revolutionary experimental vein that Kid A was, but it is a fine album nonetheless, if not the most accessible to all audiences.  If you lean to the right, or like structure, the album may not be for you.  There is also the distinct sense that the last song does not tie the album to a close sufficiently, but that may be the point...
B000062YAZ|5.0|The first and most best song on here and the Jackass movie soundtrack is Angel Of Death. I'm not totally sure I like \\"Necrophobic\\" because it's real fast, and basically, the whole album talks about death. That's okay. It's what makes this cd one of the best by Slayer I've heard.
B0002S947K|5.0|It's very rare that I find an album that I love the whole way through and this is most certainly one of them.  I can't wait for an encore from Ray Lamontagne!
B00005JNEI|1.0|I went and watched this movie twice whent it first came out in thearters...and ive come to one conclusion.....michael moore is good at editing........thats it, all the \\"facts\\" in this movie are overexaggeraited and its clear at least to me thats he manipulated film footage to make people to believe......all it is is that moore doesnt like bush so he made a movie to try to make him seem like a cold hearted person in order to get others to not like him......its pursuation by manipulation....which i think is pretty pathetic on his behalf......ths movie got so much hype over nothing.....wait til fahrenhype 9/11 comes out then see if u believe this piece of crap movie he made......i for one dont care for kerry or bush...but i read up on my history and i know that the bush administartion isnt as cold hearted as they seem in the movie so do youselves a favor and dont spend ur money on a totally unture film.
B0002MPU1K|5.0|I'm not sure what I expected from this cd - I was afraid I'd be disappointed, since I loved his first cd so much. There is more variety on this cd, although my favorites are still those numbers highlighting Peter's piano playing. Love St. Louis Blues, Raise the Roof, You Don't Know me and Cherokee. Dayum, that boy can play! And the band is tight too - Barak sounds incredible on bass. :) <br /> <br />Get this cd and you won't be disappointed. Also, if you have a chance to see Peter perform - go. He's even better in person!
B0002MONAE|5.0|Maybe I'm just out of the look but I had No idea that Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds were releasing a new album! LET ALONE A DOUBLE ALBUM! Technicly, Since I live in the states, they have not yet, but I am listening to this fantastic recording right now!<br /><br />These albums mark a new chapter in the Nick Cave bible. Abattoir Blues/Lyre Of Orpheus sees one of the strongest incarnations of The Bad Seeds in a long time. Which saddens me to say becasue Blixia's not in the band anymore. But Conway Savage, Thomas Wylder Martin P. Cacey and Mick Harvey have never sounded more together. I was really impressed with the playing on both these albums. There are monents of pure Bad Seeds grove, but then they go in to Gospel, Blue, or even Funk! Cave's voice sounds a little bit more classic then it has on other recnet recordings.<br /><br />Cave seems to have gone even further down the religious path. There are many songs (mainly on Abattoir Blues) that are pure Gospel. In fact Its easily noticed that A.B. is a little more brach then Lyre of Orpheus. Which finds its sound in more of a mellow, folkish sound on many of its song.<br /><br />This is a real double album people! Many of these songs clock in at around 5 minutes (and a few that are longer) and theres only one song that is shorter then 3 minutes (Fable Of The Brown Ape)<br /><br />I was really taken back to see this album in the new releases section. Nocturama doesn't seem like it came out that long ago. Speaking of Nocturma, i believe that anyone who was disapointed with that title will be plesently suprised with these 2 releases. The U.S. Release date is October 26th, but if you can't wait I'd say shelling out the extra bread for an Imported version is well worth it!
B0002OERI0|5.0|In the sixteen years that this has been together, they have created amazing albums one after another.  You can never go wrong buying a Green Day cd.  After a five-year hiatus they have released another perfect album, \\"American Idiot.\\"  I have been looking forward to picking up this album since I heard their first song from this album on the radio, entitled \\"American Idiot.\\"  This song is a perfect mix of drums, guitars, and of course, vocals.  They have such a distinct sound that you can't ever mistake their songs with another band's.   <br /> I purchased this album over a week ago, and I have not stopped playing it.  You don't have to skip over any tracks, you can just let it play through.  Two of the songs on the album,  \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" and \\"Homecoming,\\" are each about nine minutes long.  They are broken down into five different sections, so it's like you are getting five songs in one; which is an interesting twist that adds even more to the album.  One of my personal favorite songs on the album is \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams.\\"  It is one of the slower songs on the cd, and I find it to be one of the most personal songs on the album.  Another song I really like is the shortest song on the album, entitled \\"She's a Rebel.\\" Each song on this cd has an awesome, unique introduction that gets you pumped up to hear the rest of the song.  I can't even explain in words how perfect this cd is.  If you haven't already picked up this album, go get it now.  There is no possible way that you could not like this cd.  I'm so excited that they are back and better than ever!  If you get the opportunity to catch them on tour, definitely go for it.  They are even better live! <br />
B00005JNEI|1.0|I have a problem with a movie that will present itself as outright fact that involves so much personal bias and speculation. I respect MM's right to make a movie about what he thinks, but I don't think this is the best way to do so, and think there were some below-the-belt ploys for emotional response that have nothing to do with the points he's trying to make.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|I loved this movie, saw it back to back days. Brad Pitt was very good. He may be too pretty but he was way cool in this film.  The other actors steal the movie, especially the King that Achilles fights for. (...)The action is top notch. The death scenes and fighting sequences are equivalent to Gladiator.  Yeah, Orlando Bloom is a sniveling snot.  You will hate him because he is such (...). Helen of Troy is OK. I like my women to be more voluptous.  Stacked and curvy. She does have a beautiful face. Gladiator #1, Troy #2, Lawrence of Arabia #3  Can't wait to see Alexander The Great next.

B00003CXIP|5.0|Stephen King has turned a lot of his books into his movies, a lot of them actually good. One of my all time favorite Stephen King films is \\"Stand By Me\\". This movie really moved me that most films have never had. The late River Phoenix gave his best performance in this timeless classic. Based on the Stephen King short story \\"The Body\\", four young adolescent boys takes a weekend trip to check out a dead body. A young Wil Wheaton plays Gordie Lachance who is the narrator of this story. The young Gordie Lachance had recently lost his brother played by John Cusack (a brief but memorable cameo appearance) in the Vietnam war. Gordie is struggling to cope with his loss since his brother was the only person in his family who actually cared what Gordie did. Their parents literally ignored Gordie. The cast is rounded out by young Corey Feldman, Jerry O'Connell, the late River Phoenix, and Kiefer Sutherland. So the boys decides to go on this trek to see this dead body but they aren't alone. Kiefer Sutherland and his gang decides to see this body and collect on the reward money. The funniest moment in the film is when Gordies tells the guys a story about some fat guy who enters a pie-eating contest. That was a laugh riot. I also laughed out loud when the guys are covered in leeches. \\"Stand By Me\\" remains a personal favorite movie of mine to this very day. It still holds up well with me.

B0000026DJ|4.0|\\"Deisel and Dust\\" is that rare creature: an 80s pop album whose songs deal with issues of surprising and lasting substance. From the album's hard-hitting title to the lavish hooks with which the songs clothe their powerfully expressed political sentiments, \\"Deisel and Dust\\" came as yet another treat in a year that seemed to brim over with them (Appetite for Destruction, Tunnel of Love, Faith, Bring the Family, Cloud Nine, Sign `O The Times, Joshua Tree, Document - the list goes on). The album's sound - a Cure-meets-the-Pixies brew of gloom-rock - features an unusually successful defiance of the overproduction that characterized 80s pop. This feat is even more impressive when you consider that the album was released on the mammoth, ruthless and sales-obsessed Columbia label. Aside from the monster single \\"Beds Are Burning\\" - a song that brings this band's remarkable instinct for melody into start prominence -- quieter and more patient grooves like the haunted \\"Whoah\\" (a song that found its brother in Warren Zevon's similarly haunted \\"Prison Grove\\" from his final album) sink deeper into the listener's consciousness. Many of these songs favor the slow seduction over the immediate and therefore temporary sparks of \\"Beds Are Burning.\\" I rank this masterpiece up there with \\"Bossa Nova\\" and \\"Disintegration\\" as a pinnacle of the 80s rock scene.
078401213X|2.0|Fans of the \\"The Blair Witch Project\\" might enjoy this one. It uses the NABB camera style (need a barf bag). I don't happen to like that style myself. Call me an old camera style idealist. I like to see what is going on between actors and their surroundings. I don't like to see the camera wondering all over the place and pointing at the ground. I rented this by suggestion of a person at my local video store. I was disappointed. I had rented most the other recent scary movies like \\"The Ring\\", \\"Scream\\", \\"Fear.com\\", et cetera. They had understandable stories. This was to convaluted to suit my tastes. I would have still enjoyed it but the camera work just blew it for me. I really don't like it when cameras spin around like Linda Blair's head in \\"The Exorcist\\". Only people that love mathematical/horror movies will be remotely interested in this movie. If you want to give someone a headache, tell them to watch Pi. Someone looking for a scary movie should watch something else. I recommend \\"The Ring\\", \\"Ghost Ship\\", \\"The Sixth Sense\\", \\"The Others\\", or \\"The Exorcist\\".
B0002VKZL6|4.0|For all its tropical album art (the ugliest I have seen since the cover of JJ Cale's \\"Travelog\\"), \\"Shangri -la\\" is better suited to pulling a hard chair up to the window during a snowstorm and watching the powder pile up in the street. There is something about Mark Knopfler's aging voice - its harrowing echo like a call for help from mountains in the night - that makes me think of the steel-blue winter sky I knew as a kid in the northeast. Dusty yet clear, Knopfler's voice lends a depth and darkness to these songs that surfaced only occasionally on his great but somewhat more eclectic previous records. Those detours into bluegrass and rickety delta blues from \\"Ragpicker's Dream\\" have given way to a startlingly uniform and cohesive musical statement in \\"Shangri-la.\\"<br /><br />It seems that Knopfler's mature and broadening departure from the Dire Starits sound has come to fruition only now, as each of these gorgeous and somber tunes effortlessly blends into the next. Whoever wrote in Amazon's \\"album description\\" above that this is Mark's \\"most rocking album since his halcyon days with Dire Straits\\" is clearly confused, as \\"Shangri-la\\" is, if anything, the quietest record of the man's life. Where his last two albums opened with real boomers in \\"What It Is\\" and \\"Why Aye Man\\" respectively, here we start with the tender and narcotic \\"5:15 AM.\\" And while Knopfler gets his pulse a little more excited with the single \\"Boom, Like That,\\" the song doesn't exactly threaten cardiac arrest. If \\"Song For Sonny Liston,\\" the grungey blues dirge inspired by Nick Tosches's fabulous biography, impresses one enough to call this Mark's \\"most rocking\\" record, then tracks like \\"Imelda,\\" \\"No Can Do\\" or \\"Don't You Get It\\" from 1996's \\"Golden Heart\\" are atomic explosions.<br /><br />I admit that Mark gets a bit dull at times (especially on the sporadically comatose \\"Sailing to Philadelphia\\"), but there is a duskiness lurking within most of these tracks that raises them above the yawns they might otherwise have been. Mark's guitar licks smack of a subtlety unprecedented even in his own remarkable catalog, while the vocal harmonies he achieves amid his obvious devotion to perfecting his craft as a songwriter really suck in even the mildly attentive listener (as on the distinctly Dylanesque \\"Whoop De Doo\\" or \\"The Trawlerman's Song\\"). For a guy from the band that ranked 101st (runner up) on VH1's list of top 100 rock bands, it is quite an achievement that Mark Knopfler would emerge with a rich and wide-ranging collection of albums that achieve a depth and maturity rarely heard during the more glamorous half of his career. \\"Shangri-La\\" shyly continues that legacy, and by the time Mark's fingers have plucked their last guitar lick, one of rock's most enviable legacies will be left behind.have been.

B0002IU988|5.0|creed was a great starting point for these guys. now they can grow and grow and grow into legendary status. mark tremonti is one of the best guitarist around nowadays and it really shows on this cd. myles kennedy can sing twice as better live and with more intensity, i got to see them in pontiac,MI and holy$h!t can they rock!!!! greater solos, lyrics are great, this band is here to stay. best cd of 2004 without a doubt.
B0002T7ZKW|5.0|This is Green Day at their best. I am very glad to see, that they hooked up with Rob Cavallo again. \\"Warning\\" had some good songs, but Rob's production was sadly missed. With him back in the producer's seat, Green Day's sound is back to it's full glory. Powerfull guitars, the bass mixed to the front and perfectly gated drums. Both songs on this single are brilliant. \\"Too much too soon\\" could be an A-side by itself, and you should definitely pick up the single for this song alone. Two full speed power pop classics for less than 3 dollars ! And the \\"American Idiot\\" full length CD is brilliant as well !
B0002Z0EYA|3.0|For forty years I've been waiting for a high value re-make of Helen of Troy.  This is not it.  The departures from the Iliad are too many to accept, yet they could so easily have stuck to the historic version and it would have been just as impressive.  Brad Pitt - OK.  Agamemnon - all I see is Goring.  Bana - VG.  O'Toole - just an old O'Toole.  The battle scenes were tremendous but the death of Achilles is an insult to our intelligence.  The very short scene at the end with Aeneas was a nice touch, but Aeneas should have been up there following Hector of course.  Big Ajax - wow.  Death of Menelaus - what the ....  All that money spent on a very inaccurate version of the Iliad was a missed opportunity of the highest order.  Nontheless, if you've never read the Iliad (or Colleen McCullough's version of Troy) and are never likely to, then this film is entertaining and will appeal.  But for those who care about history that 2002 other film version is far superior.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This is my favorite CD of 2004 ! All the songs are excellent and Green Day really developed their sound without letting any of their long time fans down. What I was most happy to see was, that Rob Cavallo is back in the producer's seat. His contribution was missed on the \\"Warning\\" album where the Green Day sound was just not as powerful as on their previous (and now their latest) releases. No matter if Green Day play their songs blistering fast or at a more settled speed, they always keep a close eye on the melodies and the arrangements.... and that is where the strength is of this CD. Simply brilliant ! Also get the single \\"American Idiot\\" since the b-side \\"Too much too soon\\" is excellent as well.
B0000797IO|1.0|First, an ongoing quibble: WHY, oh why, must movies take cheap shots at religious characters in hopes of a laugh?  Does \\"The Good Girl\\" really intend us to think Justine implicating the only Christian in the movie (a stereotypically Bible-thumping one at that) in her adultery, and her husband and his best friend, with whom Justine actually HAS had sex, subsequently beating the crap out of the poor man, is funny?! <br /> <br />This movie seemed like a pathetic attempt at proving that Jennifer Aniston can act.  Small-town girl with a boring life = NOT Rachel, and apparently that's all it took for Aniston to sign on.  The movie accomplishes its goal in the sense that Aniston abandons all her Rachelian sprightliness for a single, forcedly dull facial expression, though her hair is still fashionably mussed (without the classic Texan perm and hairspray) and her clothing is cool-sloppy, a la the Gap. <br /> <br />By the time Aniston's character gets into bed with her husband's best friend to keep him quiet about her adulterous relationship with an underage, depressed clerk, the movie had already abandoned all hopes for good taste.  And maybe the last scene, with Justine and her husband snuggling her new baby, is supposed to be heartwarming, but Justine's ignorance as to her child's paternity is disturbing instead.  My sympathies, as much as they were engaged at all, lay with Justine's husband, the only even semi-innocent person in the movie, even if John Reilly's sad-faced cuckolds are getting a bit old.  His willingness to trust and forgive Justine was slightly touching--certainly better than she deserved.  Justine herself was easily ignorable, and that's the best that can be said for her.
0061020680|5.0|This books follows Death and his apprentice Mort through Discworld. And beyond. The plot boils down to Mort falling in love with someone who is going to die. While he has the power to save her, there will be a price for doing so.<br /><br />the good: He's back, folks. This book is one of the funniest I've read so far. Pratchett seems to be exploring his skills more with this book, but the humor is non-stop. It had me rolling.<br /><br />The bad: It ended? Not much to complain about.
B000001FCB|5.0|If you like the passion of live music captured on a studio recording, if you like some of the most beautiful music sung by the most beautiful voice that has ever sung, this is for you. This is the finest music there is. Every song is gorgeous.  Recently, Cesar Camarague Mariano, who was married to Elis and an arranger/keyboardist on this album, master-edited the album and this came out in a combined dvd/cd edition. Buy that version - the sound quality is better, and they include some of the chatter before the take - which is music itself. Also, if you like this, there are two dvds that Elis Regina did - one in 1973 (which is phenomenal) and another in 1980 not too long before she died. She is the definive singer on both, althou she shows the wear of age in the latter (in which she shows how beautifully she can nail a song). Breathtaking music on both - if you have to choose, buy the earlier one. They are avaialble on e-bay and perhaps Amazon.com.
B00005JNEI|5.0|A brilliant exhibit of how American have been misled on the war against (?) terrorism. <br />A must-see for all citizen in age of voting or going to war. <br />Facts after facts, Michael Moore shows a critical perspective of what will be remember as the days America went nuts. <br />Viewing this film is your chance to show the world that, afterall, America is still a democracy. Of course, do not miss your second chance : Voting against George W. in November!
B0002Z0EYA|2.0|First of all, American actors suck! They are self-absorbed, immature and the current crop of male actors seem like eternal old teen-agers. The British are by far the best actors in all the world, with their intensity, maturity and strong personalities, but they couldn't save this movie. <br /> <br />Brad Pitt was not believable to me. In each scene, he seemed to be preening and posing himself in the best light. With the long blond hair, he looked for all the world like a California surfer dude. With his current success, he seems not to be trying anymore to find the soul of the character as he did in \\"Legends of the Fall.\\" <br /> <br />The battle scenes I liked except the director got in too close and it got claustrophobic. The battle scenes in \\"Gladiator\\" (which this movie emulates) were much better. I was not familiar with this story, but the script made it easy to follow, except there was just no soul in this movie and there was in \\"Gladiator.\\"
B00029NMRM|2.0|'The Whole Nine Yards' was not a classic, but made with a surprisingly refreshing tone.  The story was unpredictable -- about the ex-hitman and the timid dentist, and some unique characters (including a hitwoman wannabe Amanda Peet).  Now, they made a sequel to it, but frankly, do we need it?  Or can they really do it when the original was based on the premise you can use just for one time? <br /> <br />The results are lame, tired, even miserable comedy that is not funny at all.  Bruce Willis comes back as Jimmy the Tulip, whose life is now, again, in danger because a mafia boss Lazlo is out of jail, who is played by Kevin Pollack.  Many characters you saw in 'The Whole Nine Yards' return (not Mr. Duncan, though)  But the central story is about the new baddie Lazlo (buried in a heavy make-up) who happens to be the father of the baddie of the original, played by the same Kevin Pollack. <br /> <br />This is the same ruse used in the sequel of 'City Slickers' -- once charming characters, after put in the right places at the end of the original film, are called back simply because another film must be made.  Bruce Willis 'must' act like silly, because he was not before; Matthew Perry (as the same dentist Oz) 'must' act like silly because he believes somebody must kill him, the plot nobody believes now.  Amanda Peet 'must' act like silly for, well, she has nothing to do this time (except for some bumbling 'jobs'); and most damagingly, Natasha Henstrige 'must' sleepwalk all through the new film simply because her role is nothing but a poor excuse for kidnapping plot, which is pointless and thrillless.        <br /> <br />In one earlier scene, Bruce Willis, now in Mexico, appears with tired face, wearing a pair of fluffy, bunny shoes.  This is the same thing as Christopher Walken did in 'Country Bears' and  that's a bad sign indeed.  You know, these films are  shamelessly craving for laughs, which they will never get in this so obvious fashion.  And as the film goes on, the cast raise the voice (see the scene in a bar), and speak out loud the long, winding, not-so-funny dialogues you can never remember after ten seconds.  Well I didn't because I fell asleep.  Sorry.    <br /> <br />One thing I should praise is that even in this mess, Bruce Willis retains his charisma to some extent.  I still don't know whether or not he can really act, like Keanu, but he is unmistakeably a star.  In this case, however, that only makes this film more unwatchable.
B000068OCS|5.0|Everyone obviously has taste and opinion, but simply put, this is my favorite movie of all time (altho, as at least one other reviewer mentioned, not as powerful as the big screen).  There is no film like it, except perhaps the Imax film Chronos (which is basically the eye candy with no substance) and possibly the sequel.  But those are only similarities in style of filmmaking, not in quality. <br /> <br />But I will say, while it's my favorite movie, I can only stand to watch it about every 5 years, because for about 3-4 days after watching Koyaanisqatsi, I can barely deal with this society.  It just makes me want to cry to drive on city streets. <br /> <br />So if you're already trying to come to grips with reality, this movie probably would be counter-productive.  But for everybody who thinks everything about modern western civilization truly is \\"progress\\", I couldn't recommend this film enough. <br /> <br />What it will be for those people, is a priceless perspective adjustment.  It won't make you permanently pessimistic or anything, it will just give you a new perspective.

You get to see Chihiro's parents turn into piggies and how she makes new friends! simply love this movie
B00005JMJG|4.0|This is one of those movies that raises the question, what if? What if this kind of technology was real, would I have somebody or something erased, and if I did who or what would it be?<br /><br /> Upon first viewing of this movie I thought it was a little drawn out and not as entertaining as I thought it would be, but as the days pass I find myself thinking about it and thinking about who or what I would erase and I find that I can't get this movie out of my head, and by that standard I find this to be a great movie.<br /><br /> Definitely worth the watch, but don't expect the Jim Carrey of old.
B00004SC3M|3.0|This movie is a lot of fun to watch, with the dares and the snares and the excitement and of course Ms Zeta-Jones' lovely physique. I don't mind about the budding romance between Catherine and Connery, for even given a large age difference, two people engaged in such an intense project together would end up feeling some physical attraction. Still, much of what happens strains credulity even for film-goers. And what happened to all the other people? Would the FBI leave the platform so quickly? And the other passengers not come back? And even if Connery likes his privacy, is he really doing all the dusting in that vast castle by himself? Who is doing the cooking?
B00005UEAR|4.0|After Dream Theater released Scenes From A Memory, their greatest album, I don't think they'd be able to top it. Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence proves this. Don't get me wrong - I love the album! With heart! But, as an avid Dream Theater fan, I don't think this was as good as Scenes From A Memory.    Let's listen through the first disk. The Glass Prison is a very good song. A very heavy one, too. I was liking it a lot. It was 13 minutes of Godliness. Now here's track two, Blind Faith. Wasn't as good as The Glass Prison, but it was still enjoyable. Misunderstood was better than Blind Faith, yet not as good as The Glass Prison. I didn't like the rest of the album much, but when I got to the second disk, I was in for a hell of a ride.    The starting instrumental, Overture, was fantastic! Although not as good as Overture 1928, it was highly enjoyable, and it was immediately my favorite song on the album(s), with The Glass Prison next. The rest of disk 2 is fantastic. It has a story like Scenes From A Memory, but on this album, it seems to be a gimmick to draw you in more. The story was decent, but it was good they quit the story business with Train Of Thought.    Overall, this was a good album. My personal favorites are:    The Glass Prison (10/10)  Misunderstood (9/10)  Overture (10/10)  The Test That Stumped Them All (9/10)    Overall, Six Degrees is a great purchase. Dream Theater hasn't made one bad album their whole career. They've made some less than perfect ones (Falling Into Infinity, When Dream And Day Unite), but this two-disk studio album is definitely a keeper. It is a great album! This is also their heaviest album next to Train Of Thought. Get this if you're a Dream Theater fan. If you are not a Dream Theater fan, get a CD like Images And Words, Scenes From A Memory or Train Of Thought before picking this up.    Step Forward: New heavy sound!  Step Backward: Story is a gimmick  Step Backward: Only one instrumental? Dammit!
B0001I561E|4.0|\\"Aladdin,\\" though still a good movie, sadly seems a bit out-of-date now because Disney ruined the franchise with all those direct-to-video sequels and because the Genie impressions and cultural jokes are from the early '90s.<br /><br />The story is solid, the message is clear, the villain is good and the music is great.<br /><br />But it hasn't aged as well as other timeless Disney classics, like the grand \\"Beauty and the Beast.\\" So this DVD is getting loaded with modern \\"extras\\" to help market it to an audience of children that wasn't alive when \\"Aladdin\\" and its 3,000 or so spinoffs was released.<br /><br />Now, in addition to the corny, overwrought Peabo Bryson and Regina Belle version of \\"A Whole New World,\\" Disney gives us Nick Lachey and Jessica Simpson doing a similarly overwrought cover. Is this progress?<br /><br />And, as for resurrecting \\"Proud of Your Boy,\\" a song originally written by Menken and Ashman to Aladdin's mother (because when the original storyboards were drawn up, he wasn't an orphan), I'd be more excited if it wasn't being sung by \\"American Idol\\" instant celebrity Clay Aiken.<br /><br />The movie of 12 years ago won points for being culturally of-the-moment, but now it's dated. These DVD extras, while making the DVD of-the-moment, may cause the movie the same problems 12 years from now.<br /><br />\\"Aladdin\\" is fun, but it's far from timeless.
B0001YRVN4|4.0|For my money, Lord of the Rings is the absolute best. First off, there's no question that the original theatrical releases should have been included with these DVDs.  The movies are so different from one another that it would be interesting for true Star Wars buffs to compare them.  George Lucas' answer?  \\"Well, I'm sorry that fans fell in love with a movie only half done but they're still on VHS.\\" These are actually even slightly different than the re-re-releases from a few years ago.  In Jedi, for instance, the young Hayden (from the new movies) replaces the original actor as Darth's ghost in the end (with a still aged Alec Guiness, not Ewan McGregor, as Ben). <br /> <br />The first movie, Star Wars still lives up to it's reputation.  You will notice that the bar scene is a lot different.  Jabba's appearance in the movie only adds to it, in my opinion. The Empire Strikes Back, also, has lost none of it's power.   <br /> <br />And then, we have Return of the Jedi.  Although it was better than I remembered it, by this time the series had become a shameless attempt to market children's toys (everyone in the movie is an action figure).  Characters like the Ewoks and the small bug-eyed giggling aliens who ride with Lando during the attack serve no purpose at all other than, seemingly, comic relief for children. It is at this point that takes Star Wars out of the running for me as the greatest trilogy. <br /> <br />There are several documentaries included with the set that are worth watching.  The game demo is on XBox, though, and I don't think they tell you that on the box.   <br /> <br />All in all worth the money, but hardly as \\"fan friendly\\" as some of us would have liked.  If episodes 7-9 get produced (as there are rumors of), one hopes that Lucas will produce, not write or direct them because the first two of the new installments have lacked the old magic.
B00003CXCT|5.0|It seems like once every decade some from of entertainment comes along that just speaks to me on all levels.  It captures my interest and I want to know everything about it and experience it again and again.  These days it's the music of Bruce Springsteen.  The book \\"Lonesome Dove\\" did that.  For most of my childhood, it was Star Wars.  I've never completely lost interest in the movies, but that interest in the original Star Wars trilogy was greatly diminished by the inferior (Phantom Menace) and wretched (Attack of the Clones) prequels.  The inconsistencies, the overemphasis on bad special effects, and the overall poor writing and acting in the two newest movies really tarnished my memories of the originals.  Some of that was justified, as the weakness of the prequels made the flaws of the originals all the more evident.  But how could I have resisted watching on DVD what were once my alltime favorite movies, especially when my own children were aware that they were about to be released and were expressing the same interest that I had shown when I was just a little older than they are now, back in 1977?  I couldn't resist that, and I'm glad that I didn't.    Despite their vastly sub par prequels, these movies are as wonderful as I remember them, and seeing them in this format on a low-end widescreen TV with a moderately decent surround sound system has actually been more enjoyable than I could have imagined.  And let's face it- like a lot of people who grew up in the 70s and 80s, I know every second of dialogue, sound effects and music in these movies.  I could recite them in my sleep.  I'm not sure I'm proud to admit that, but it's the truth.  You don't get that way by disliking a movie.  I got that way because at one point, these films were so good and so entertaining that you wanted to see them over and over again.  Yeah, the responsibilities of adulthood take away some of that magic.  Some of it.  But not all of it...      Everything that was wonderful about the original Star Wars movies remains so.  There are so many unforgettable sounds and images, some of them major, some of them tiny:  the stark white of the rebel cruiser, the glowing eyes and gibberish of the Jawas, the hiss of Vader's breath, Luke first igniting his lightsbaer and that imitable hum, the otherworldly weirdness upon first entering the Cantina, Chewbacca's grunts and growls, the corridors of the Death Star, the murky water in the trash compactor, Luke and Leia swinging across the chasm, Ben Kenobi disappearing upon being struck down by Vader, those awesome gun turret chairs on the Millenium Falcon, the orange flight uniforms of the X-Wing pilots, the explosion of the Death Star, the blue ice of Hoth, the lumbering bass of the AT-ATs, Yoda raising Luke's X-Wing, the danger of the asteroids hurtling by the Falcon, those bounty hunters like Bossk and IG-88, the beauty of Cloud City, the hellish glow of the carbon freezing chamber,\\"I know.\\", the thump of carbonite encased Han Solo landing on the ground,  the clash of light sabers between Luke and Vader, Princess Leia's devastation as Boba Fett narrowly escapes with Han, Vader's terrible revelation on the gantry after Luke looses his hand, the rebel fleet gathered around the nebula, the first glimpse of Jabba, Luke's somersault over the Sarlacc pit, the arrival of the Emperor, the speeder bikes, the lightening from the Emperor's hands, Vader's final act of goodness, the victory fireworks over Endor, and those ghosts smiling at Luke at the end.  And there's that wonderful, glorious music that underscores the whole thing- that's another whole review by itself that I won't get into here.  The list goes on and on and on, and you know exactly what I'm talking about.  Those images are indelible in our imagination, and will be with us for the rest of our lives.  Never mind the Ewoks and the dumb looking aliens in Jabba's court and the illogical physics- there's so much good in these movies that the flaws are easily overlooked.  It's only a movie, but for a brief two hours, it's much, much more than that.       Lucas's changes range from needed to unacceptable.  I don't have a problem with updating the special effects, although as the prequels reveal, CGI is really no match for detailed models, props, sets and costumes.  Those discrepancies are especially apparent with the new-found clarity that DVD allows.  But they don't distract from the film nearly as much as they do in the prequels (have I mentioned that I don't much care for those?).  The addition of Jabba is unnecessary, and while a bit better than in the 1997 version, still embarrassing.  Replacing the original ghost of Anakin with Hayden Christensen is the change that I found to be the most offensive.  I understand the logic behind it, but I think it's terribly disrespectful to remove a longstanding actor (who is now deceased) who has long been identified with that role.  No matter that the role is minor- Lucas should have considered that the timeline and the choice of actors didn't match up with the original movies when casting Anakin for the prequels rather than undoing his sloppiness later.  It's an ominous sign and an indication of what's wrong with his current style of filmmaking that Lucas values technology over an individual performance.  But overall, these changes don't distract from the movies- they are basically as you remember them.  Since we're not going to convince Lucas of the evil of his ways, I'd rather have the DVDs with the changes than to not have them at all.  I know, I know- more money in this pockets that just reinforces his misguided notions.  Anyway...    The extras?  Haven't watched the main documentary yet, but it sounds good.  I enjoyed the trailers and TV spots- talk about bringing back memories.  The \\"preview\\" for Episode III is intriguing but doesn't reveal much.  The video game advertisements are worthless, and won't help this set from looking dated in a few years.  I'd have liked to have had deleted scenes, an isolated score, and a few more things, but overall, not a shabby set of extras.  Besides, we're buying this for the movies themselves, and these things are just icing on the cake.    Video and sound are fantastic, although these movies are all over 20 years old and won't compare to modern films that were made with DVDs in mind.  Some odd mixes for the score in Ep. IV, with some of my favorite bits of music being faded out at very inopportune times.  Lucasfilm claims that this was intentional, but they're pretty good at following their boss's lead of revising history, so I don't trust them.  But again, overall very spectacular use of Dolby 5.1 and widescreen.  (And for the love of God, people, buy the widescreen versions, even if you don't have a widescreen TV.  You just don't know what you're missing in a fullscreen format!)    If you loved Star Wars back then or now, go buy these DVDs.  That's what it boils down to- if you want Star Wars on DVD, this is how you're going to get them.  That's not a bad thing.  You can complain about the changes and the poor quality of the prequels all you want.  I certainly do.  But that doesn't diminish how truly wonderful these movies are, even with the relatively minor changes made to them over the years.  Nothing can replicate the first time you saw them, but seeing them on DVD comes pretty close.  Enjoy them with your kids, watch them alone, whatever.  But there's no diminishing the fact that for millions of people, many of us now on the near side of age 40, these are simply the greatest movies of all time.  The Force was with us to have been born at the right time to see and love Star Wars...

B00000DFTG|5.0|Many swore that it would never happen. The moral is NEVER say 'never', I guess. 'Reunion', the 2-CD live release of Black Sabbath was recorded at the NEC Arena in Birmingham, UK on December 12,1997. Proving that even though the band had called it a day in late 1978, 'Reunion' sounds like the four guys had never really been apart. Remember: it's the four founding members of Ozzy, Iommi, Ward and Butler. I remember seeing the band once out on an Ozzfest tour and the guy in front of me KEPT repeating, \\"All four original members of Black Sabbath playing together - LIVE.....a chance of a lifetime!!\\". Yes, I can certainly understand as to what he was all stoked about. As for the track listing, one honestly couldn't ask for more. Always nice to hear the goodies such as \\"War Pigs\\", \\"Fairies Wear Boots\\" one of the true highlights of 'Reunion', \\"Into The Void\\", \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\\", the list goes on. A great live sound mix. A must-have for all Sabbath fans.
0060586230|5.0|Using his unique style, Vonnegut tells the galaxy about our dying planet.  He sees it as a hideous mess of robotic creatures programmed to destroy themselves, specifically through destruction by American capitalism and racism.  At times this does seem a bit cliche, but his style is anything but.  It's funny, original, and at times very personal. <br /> <br />The best parts of the book are when he literally draws himself into the story.  He tries to be a good God to his characters, but seems to fail as our Creator must have.  It's not as good as Slaughter House Five, but his shocking style is in strong form. <br /> <br />For those who want to pick up the audio version for the Vonnegut interview- don't.  In the beginning of the interview Vonnegut and his interviewer both reveal that they havent read the book in a while, then proceed to talk about completely unrelated topics which go nowhere.  Tucci does a fine job of reading though.
B0002IU988|5.0|Alter Bridge surprised me in the way the the musicians have stepped up since Creed. The Drummer is doing way more awesome beats than when he was in creed and of course he guitarist is so incredible. Myles Kennedy, \\"The lead singer\\" has amazing vocal range and the bassist is sweet! Alter bridge, I would have to say, is sweeter than creed. Astounding tracks: 3,5, and 8!
B0001AP12G|5.0|this is great to listen to if...youve just droped out of school or your about graduate....or actually anytime...he speaks only truth and it is soooo friggin funny.....anyone will love this........i swear to it...will be a classic...
B00005B36H|5.0|I have known Tool since their very first Cd. They Have mucically inspired me in so many ways. The Drummer can't be human because of how incredibly amazing and talented he is. He is like my role model and he is so freaking amazing!!! The guitarist I ver creative and the Bassist is my favorite bassist ever!!! Also the lead singer, maynerd, is astonishing!! There is not enough words for me to describe how amazing these guys are. if I could gove it more stars, i would! All the songs are sweet, there is no song that i dislike!
B000005GWH|5.0|An awesome display of music! This CD is worth more than you will pay. Satisfaction guaranteed!
B00005JLYW|5.0|I realize this movie is silly in all respects. <br />I just can't help loving it. <br />I've seen it several times and I expect it to just be boring <br />and not like it --- yet I like it again. <br /> <br />I'm sorry. <br /> <br />I really like it.
B00005Y228|5.0|don't write about this album, just dance to it - you're one way ticket to an uncomplicated, happy life.
B000002JOH|5.0|Vulgar Display picks up where Cowboy's from hell left off. With Dimebag Darrel absolutly obliterating everything in his path with razor sharp riffs, while Phil Anselmo follows suit with explosive outbursts that will make you want to immediatly start destroying the room your in.   Alright so its not that extreme. In fact the song tempos are actually slowed down in the epics \\"This Love\\" and \\"Hollow.\\" However none the less The Riffing is still very tight just more groove oriented. Anselmo massvily improves his vocals on VDOP completly straying away from the sound of his early howlings on Comboys from Hell. It became Pantera's most famous album and not without reason. It remains one of the greatest testaments to metal ever recorded.
0385659806|5.0|If you're shopping around on Amazon for something to fill out your basket, one word of advice:  BUY THIS BOOK! I guarantee you find it interesting and above all, the most unusual book you've come across in years.  Told from the perspective of an autistic boy, this one will take you into a world you've never known.  Highly recommended along with THE SECRET LIFE OF BEES  and THE BARK OF THE DOGWOOD (another book told from an interesting perspective.)
B000093BDX|4.0|The Beach Boys had an extraordinary career, and they are the greatest American Band Ever.  That is why it is hard to make a cd with thirty of their best songs.  \\"Sounds of Summer\\" does a decent job overall, but there are many gems missing like \\"friends\\", \\"breakaway\\", \\"This whole world\\", \\"Surf's Up\\", \\"Please let me wonder\\", just to name a few.  If one wants to really appreciate the Beach Boys, he should buy all their albums, except for a few that were made in the eighties.
B00005ASHM|5.0|I had to listen to Pet sounds about four times before I really began to enjoy it.  I was used to hits like \\"Fun, Fun Fun\\", and \\"Help Me, Rhonda\\".  Pet Sounds is a huge departure from the Beach Boys formula.  yet, the music grew on me.  The melodies are some of the most beautiful I have ever heard.  \\"Don't Talk...\\" is one of the greatest ballads of all time.  Brian Wilson wrote this album when he was twenty-three years old.  This music was really innovative for its time, and it was a huge inspiration for the highly overrated Beatles.  The chord progressions and the harmonies are smilar to chords heard in Jazz music.  This certainly is one of the greatest albums of all time, and anyone who thinks otherwise does not appreciate good music.
B00005ABX0|4.0|Smiley Smile and Wild Homey are both highly underrated albums.  We all know the history behind smiley smile.  Yet, even though it was a let down to fans at the time, the album really is a gem.  \\"Gettin Hungry\\" is one of the most experimental songs on the album.  If one was to here it, they might not know that it is the Beach boys.  Wild Honey is an outstanding album, that could be compared with the Beatles albums of that time period.  \\"A thing or two\\" is a great song, along with the acoustic and innovative \\"I 'd love just once to see you\\".  Any music fan should get this double album and be educated.  Smiley Smile is a little weird, but their are many great vocals on it.  Once again, the Beach Boys DO NOT disappoint. I give it a four simply because these albums are not better than Pet Sounds, which deserves a 5.
B00006879E|5.0|If you're into different genres, then this is a must have album. Adam Levine has this distinct voice that makes every song unique. I especially love sweetest goodbye. I actually love all of the songs the reason why i considered this album as already a classic, the very reason why this is one of the all-time favorite albums. You'd love to hear this song when you have nothing to do, when it's raining outside, or simply just bumming around. i love to listen to this album every morning when i just woke up to perk my morning, listen to it again after i eat my lunch, after i come back from school, after i eat my dinner, and before i go to sleep. Hey, it seems like i listen to it every other day.
B00005B36H|5.0|Since I have heard it for first time I cannot stop enjoying their music.Thank you guys! <br />
0553573403|5.0|There are numerous reviews about this book and its accompanying series.  The reason there are so many is because this book is a classic.  It is one of those rare books that takes you \\"every which way but loose.\\"  It's plots are intricate and no character is safe.  You are finally left expecting the unexpected and even then he spins your heels around.  The series is smartly written and never boring.  You won't regret this one.
B0002YCVXI|5.0|Ennio Morricone's sense of melody is unsurpassed not only in the world of film, but in Art music and Popular music as well. From the mid-1960's on, when Morricone wrote devestating, original scores for Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns, Morricone's ability to combine classical melodic lines with grunts, whistles, electric guitars and drums often surpassed the films he scored. His music, unlike most film composer's, adds new layers of meaning onto whatever images flash by.<br /><br />Yo-Yo Ma's melodic feel matches Morricone's evocative melodies; I would have never imagined the cello being an effective vehicle for a Morricone transcription, but now that I hear Ma playing, I hear how obvious and how perfect the congruence sounds. The richness of Morricone's later scores - Cinema Paradiso - The Mission - The Untouchables surround me with a palpable presence that outlives the echoes of the the film's images.<br /><br />My personal favorite of Morricone's work has always been \\"The Good, the Bad, and Ugly,\\" and while Ma only plays one selection, the piece he chose, \\"The Ecstasy of Gold\\" makes up for the lack of other music from the film. The tense theme works around a circular four note statement that grows and grows in intensity and speed, eventually accompanied by drums and full orchestra, until Ma's cellos fills the room with urgency, greed, and violence.<br /><br />I can't recommend this CD too highly for lovers of Ennio Morricone or Yo-Yo Ma.
B000009CEM|5.0|To all FF fans. Remember how nearly all Fear Factory songs are based around the drums? Well, on this cd, drums are a background instrument. That's right, the guitar is the main focus in this cd, and the drums merely back it up. That being said, while having a sound that differentiates from the typical Fear Factory we know and love, this cd still manages to achieve the loud, \\"Turn that down, young man!\\" values we've come to expect from a good Fear Factory album. The opening title, Shock, says on its own before you've gone any further that the cd is going to kick some seriously(...) butt. The next song, Edgecrusher, used turn tables to enhance the already high octane chorus that will have you speeding 90 miles down a crowded freeway if you're not careful. Smasher/devourer takes a step down, losing the fast pace of \\"High\\" octane and replacing it with \\"Pure\\" octane. In other words: turn it up as loud as you freakin can, cuz this one sounds best that way. Securitron 2000 is kind of a bland song, offering nothing special, although the opening is cool. Hi-Tech Hate is an awesome song that uses heavy drums and awesome guitar to make the vocals of Burton C. Bell seem even cooler than they already are. Freedom or Fire is a fast paced, guitar based song that you can't not listen to. Obsolete has a cool chorus, but the rest of it sounds kinda like everyone was doin their own thing instead of making a song. Resurrection uses an orchestra and heavy guitar combined the Burton's awesome melodic vocals to make for a 6 minute piece that's so good it doesn't even feel like 6 minutes. Timelessness uses the orchestra also, however, this time, it's incredibly depressing. If you're having troubles in life, skip this one or you'll kill yourself listening to it. lol, j/k. Cars...cars, cars, cars...I never thought the 80's version could get cooler. But guess what, with the combined vocals of Burton C. Bell and the original singer, Gary Numan, this song is pulled off with excellency and is easily one of the best songs on the cd. NOTE: A very interesting feature in this cd, for those of you who look at lyrics books, is a screenplay written inside the lyrics book. The screenplay revolves around the songs, and it all makes sense if you read through it. It's definitely worth checking out.
B000002AZ8|5.0|After the classic hard rock album known as 'Ten' and the angry hard rock album 'Vs.', Pearl Jam take the rage up a notch, along with the craziness. This album is one of Pearl Jam's darkest, and it rocks very hard, but some of the \\"songs\\" or \\"experiments\\" (\\"Bugs\\", \\"Stupid Mop\\") are just plain stupid. But the other songs are some of PJ's best work, from the punkish \\"Spin the Black Circle\\" to the ballad \\"Nothingman\\". By the way, this album, in my opinion, has Vedder's GREATEST vocals out of all of PJ's work. <br /> <br />1. Last Exit (9/10)-Pretty darn good rocker, not much uniqueness though. Great song. <br /> <br />2. Spin The Black Circle (10/10)-About Vedder's love for vinyl, this song rocks very hard and is very fast. Awesome vocals from Vedder. <br /> <br />3. Not For You (8/10)-Another rocker, this song isn't quite as hard or fast as \\"STBC\\", but it is a pretty good song. Vedder shines. <br /> <br />4. Tremor Christ (6/10)-DARK. This song has amazing haunting vocals from Vedder, but that's about the only good element. <br /> <br />5. Nothingman (9/10)-Pretty darn good ballad, stays slow the whole time. EXCELLENT VOCALS. <br /> <br />6. Whipping (10/10)-Finally back the rock. This song is very fast and rocks extremely hard. The intro is pretty awesome. Great semi-melodic choruses. Vocals aren't as good as other songs, but still okay. <br /> <br />7. Pry, To (3/10)-One of the \\"experiments\\", this song is just plain crap. <br /> <br />8. Corduroy (10/10)-The first of this album's two big hits. Pretty good rocker with a very nice melodic chorus and a mid-section that is amazing. BEST VOCALS ON THE ALBUM, VEDDER ABSOLUTELY SHINES ON THIS! <br /> <br />9. Bugs (1/10)-Don't even get me started on this song. IT IS HORRIBLE. If you were to look up \\"crap\\" in the dictionary, you would find this song. Bad accordion playing over some pretty crappy vocals from Vedder. <br /> <br />10. Satan's Bed (7/10)-Dark rocker. This song is rockin' with a very odd intro. Good vocals, but indication of Vedder's mumble is here. <br /> <br />11. Better Man (10/10)-Chances are that you have most likely heard this song. This is the second big hit on the album. Excellent song, starts off at a slow pace, but gets kinda fast and heavy towards the end. <br /> <br />12. Aye Davanita (2/10)-Filler. Good bass from Ament though. <br /> <br />13. Immortality (8/10)-The last real song on the album. A nice slow number. GREAT. <br /> <br />14. Stupid Mop (-89374298342134/10)-I will now express my hatred for this song. It is ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. Purely filler. <br /> <br />This is Pearl Jam's last hard rocking album. I'm not saying the later work is bad, in fact it is very good, just softer. Soon after this album, Vedder would lose his rage, and start to mumble instead of singing (not necessarily a bad thing). If you like this I would definately recommend their 'Vs.' album, it rocks hard and is angry, but is at a less dark tone than this one.
B00018D44U|1.0|I didnt enjoy the experience of listening to this album one little bit. Unless your a 50 year old woman going through a mid life crisis i wouldn't recomend this to you.
B000002H33|5.0|This album is a solid metal album but i suggest you check out Rust In Peace by Megadeth instead. It is 10x better. Btw Dave Mustaine wrote track no.6 \\"Leper Messiah\\" but never got any credits for it. I'm sure he wrote \\"Disposable Heroes\\" too because Megadeth has a similar song which is much better called \\"She-Wolf\\". Check it out!!!! Peace.
B000094DUP|1.0|Not the best album ive ever heard. After what the media was saying i though this would be great, i was wrong, all of the songs sound just like each other and after youve listened to the album once it becomes very very boring. I apalled.
B000002I25|5.0|I'm not a big fan of the whole psychadelic period(except for these guys,the stones '67 on,hendrix,and cream),but when I first heard this album,I was in awe.Never have I heard such mind-warping lyrics and an organ on a rock track that actually sounded pleasant.No one pulled off an effort like this before them,and no one to this day could do it again.This debut is simply magical and very,as most people have put it,atmospheric.Morrison's voice is just hypnotizing.His lyrics are very poetic,afterall the guy was a poet.At times,the lyrics may have underlying meanings,but that's the cool thing.Just the whole \\"what the hell does that mean?\\" after your first listen of \\"The End\\".Sure Jim was known for his excesses,but he was a genius without a doubt.The entire album rocks from the opening drums of \\"Break On Thru\\" to the decresendo of the epic and enigmatic \\"The End\\".Only listen to this album when you have time to listen to it straight thru.It all goes together so well and anything these guys did up to LA WOMAN is essential music for anyone into psychadelic rock or even hard rock. <br /> <br />Long live The Doors!Long live the Lizard King!!!!
B00005JNEI|1.0|It is sad that someone who hates his own country so much is allowed to make a movie like this, but then if we didn't have free speech, our country wouldn't be the beloved country that it is.  There is so much hatred presented & if you research, many \\"so-called facts\\" are edited & twisted so that you really can't believe any of this.  Hopefully most of the citizens of this country, no matter what political party you are a member of will not fall for Mr. Moore's rantings & ravings. Actually this movie is an embarassment to most Democrats & they are distancing themselves from it. I wanted to rate this movie with 0 stars but had to put in a 1 in order for my review to print.
B0000029AL|5.0|Although most of the songs on here may not be as memorable as \\"Walk This Way\\" or \\"Sweet Emotion\\",this album is a display of true,bluesy,gritty,\\"back to the roots\\" rock and roll music.No shiny over-produced numbers here like \\"Rag Doll\\" or \\"Angel\\".Perry and Whitford's guitars are as raw as they will ever get on this LP and Joey Kramer's overlooked drumming is given the attetion it deserves.Steven Tyler sings in an almost unrecognizable voice,but still sounds brilliant in concert staples like \\"Mama Kin\\" and \\"Dream On\\".Other standouts include \\"Movin' Out\\",\\"Make It\\",\\"Walkin' The Dog\\", and \\"Write Me\\".All of these songs have superb guitar melodies and Tyler's style is just untouchable.This is the foot-stompin',feel good rock and roll Aerosmith became known for.But with this album,they weren't at the head-bangin' hard rock of \\"Toys\\" and \\"Rocks\\" yet.Still,anything from Aerosmith's 70's cataloge is destined to please any lover of true hard rock.
B00018D44U|5.0|look, i think this whole thing about this being crappy is that people didn't get what they expected. people fell in love with her jazz, and then she did the change up to country/folk. personally, i like both, and country a little more (i'm also from texas, and grew up with a great appreciation for folk and folk-country music). it also doesn't help that she's from my college. but all that put aside, i love this cd. it's the kind of cd you play when you're out on the porch in the summer, just relaxing. also good for maybe a romanticish dinner that's outside? i also really like that she's trying new styles to see what kinds of singing she likes to do, why turn out 5 cds that all sound the same? i admire artists that put forth an honest effort to expand their horizons, especially when the product comes out so nicely. five stars is a must
0316776963|4.0|I read this book on the beaches of Playa del Carmen on my honeymoon.  It was an enjoyable, easy read, with terrific humor and memorable stories.  I especially enjoyed the first half of the book, with stories about his childhood and family.  The second half deals more with his transition into Parisian life.  I didn't find myself laughing out loud quite so often, but still a wonderful vacation read.
B000286SCO|4.0|I find this DVD to be only worthy of 4 stars.  Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Dream Theater fan and have most their albums but, in comparison to some of their other stuff, is kinda boring.  I know it's old, but, nonetheless, I still don't enjoy watching it AS MUCH as Live Scenes from NY and Budokan (although I still love watching they're live show anyday).
B00004XONN|5.0|Next to ok computer this is defenitley the greatest album of all time. This album is perfect in every way and it gets better every time you listen to it. I'd give 10,000 stars if I could.
B000092ZYX|5.0|When I first listened to this album, I was considerably let down. '2+2=5' is a great song, but outshined by the live version on Com Lag. 'I Will' is also better on Com Lag. What the hell is wrong with 'The Gloaming'? What were they thinking when they wrote 'Myxomatosis'? But like every other Radiohead album out there, this grows on you. As hopeless as it seemed at first, every song on this album at one point or another was my favorite, as usual. At first I was put off by the skewedness of certain songs ('Backdrifts', 'The Gloaming') but they grew on me. Overall this album is the perfect columnation of Radiohead's preceding albums, if you give it time.
B00004BZ0N|1.0|I bought this album about last year. I'd been told for years that this album was a masterpiece and so on. When I heard it I kind of liked the opening song, except for the disrespectful remark about the beatles. But when I heard the rest, I had never been so dissapointed in my life. This is [...] music for [...] new wave fans.
1401301010|4.0|I picked up an andvance copy on a Saturday and was finished by Sunday. The writing flowed and was easy to read. When I finished the book I was stunned by all of the chances Mr. Kiedis has been allotted in one lifetime. There is no doubt in my mind Anthony Kiedis has been put on this earth to do far more than sing and write lyrics for a rock band. I wonder if he appreicates all life has afforded him. One critscism, emapathy and intimacy were rarely translated. It was more \\"matter of fact\\" which left me with a feeling his soul has grown impervious to the worlds soft decay.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This is the greatest piece of art ever to be created. Buy now!!!
B000001FMX|5.0|Why oh why was it ever so difficult for someone born in the late seventies (1977, namely) to find out about the New York Dolls. Maybe it's my fault for not digging deeper into the music scene but either way I'm glad I found out about 'em.  For years I was buying all these Rolling Stones cd's (of which many of them past 1973  aren't that great) because I didn't think any other band was out there who sounded near as good as them.  <br />Well, I've had to recheck that theory upon my new discovery. And I came about them through hearing about Johnny Thunders (via Martin Scorsese's usage of 'You Can't Put Your Arms Around A Memory in Bringing out the Dead). This album is simply delicious rock n' roll and, because I've listened to so much of the Stones, I unfortunately feel obliged to compare the two bands, and the New York Dolls, dare I say, are better. This stuff is great. Can't wait to check out 'Too Much Too Soon.' Looks like I may have to pay an arm and a leg for it though because they're all outta print. The Dolls came out with only two studio albums? How does that happen? I'll have to read that book by Nina something and find out what in the world happened. They even covered 'Somethin' Else' on a live album, 'Red Patent Leather' (I think that's what it's called). So tasteful. <br />
B00005JNEI|5.0|Michael Moore has a specific viewpoint and a clear agenda.  There is no question that his movie is intended to provoke a response rather than merely provide a bland analysis of the Bush presidency.  It is fascinating to see footage of the president and his advisors that has never been aired elsewhere and is not a pre-arranged photo-op or soundbite.  Also, the image of Vice President Gore carrying out his duties in the Senate by dismissing the challenges to the 2000 election results is stunning.  That's right.... Gore is pounding the gavel to silence those who were trying to file official protests on his behalf.  Regardless of your opinion on that election, these scenes are highly entertaining. <br /> <br />In my opinion, Moore's movie is most effective when presenting the American citizens who have been investigated by the government under the guise of \\"national security\\".  The idea that someone would be visited by the FBI after criticising the president while working out at a health club scares me greatly.  I love this country and it sickens me to see such un-American police powers.  I now understand why one of the most conservative members of Congress in the last 10 years, Bob Barr of Georgia, has signed on as a consultant to the ACLU to fight the USA Patriot Act.   <br /> <br />In Moore's previous films, he shaped the issues by adding his own voice at every turn.  With this film, he has greatly reduced this tendency.  Comparatively speaking, he is rather tame in his own personal commentary, particularly after the Bush- Saudi segment.  He also limits his use of \\"ambush journalism\\" that is a staple of his earlier works.   I can only recall one instance of him trying to goad someone he was attempting to interview and even that segment was less confrontational than his usual style.   <br /> <br />I highly recommend this film. <br /> <br />    <br /> <br />   <br />
B00005Q5WC|5.0|Recently all my CDs were stolen, among them a massive collection of Marley CDs.  I can now say I'm glad it happened because if it hadn't I wouldn't have begun to purchase the deluxe editions of Exodus, Catch A Fire, Rastaman Vibration, Legend, and Burnin.  Exodus is the best of the deluxe editions.  The sound quality, packaging, etc. are incredible.  However, the best thing about the CD, which it seems the other reviewers thought so too, was the series of live songs that overlap on CD 2.  It's how the Marley and the Wailer's music was meant to be heard.  I loved how the songs overlapped into really one long number rather than different songs and how they exchanged words between songs.  After becoming a little weary of BM and the Wailer's music because of listening to so many studio tracks I can say that I'm now back to listening to Marley everyday.  CD 1 was really strong as well, especially Roots, which came through beautifully.  It's great to see Island Records really putting in some effort to creating a NEW and improved release rather than just tracks in a different order and a pretty package.
B000000W6F|5.0|Gish had such an impression on all of us especially the kids who were losers like me.  The kids who had taste and personality were the ones with this tape in thier car or at home in thier parents boombox. I personally had to toss out the guns n roses tape that my dad whould always blast.  But honestly this cd is worth the price.  Such feeling and a sense of power put into the music. In its time it was so different from everything else, very original and ahead of its time.
B00005JLRT|1.0|This movie had the traditional sci-fi problem of producers who want more action and broader appeal. However, it had further issues: the writers of the movie apparently were not fans of the series at all. This resulted in  a plethora of extensive and glaring mistakes which fans who actually care about serialization readily noticed. Meaning that if one actually cares that the movie integrates into the star trek universe as laid out previously this movie is woefully inadequate and unworthy to be considered Canon of the ST universe.<br /><br />The Romulans and the Federation fought alongside for three years yet the movie claims that the Fed and Romulans don't have proper docking procedures.... Then there are the defiant class collaborations with the Star Empire... among a lot of other Rom-Federation incidents that totally counter the retarded statement at the end of the movie about docking. When has a Star Trek Ship ever docked in space with another ship anyway... transporters and shuttle craft anyone?<br /><br />In addition to the ludicrous \\"docking procedure\\" comments there is the issue of Picard supposedly having been bald when he was young... which is clearly countered by at least three cannon (TNG series) contradictions. The first is one of the episodes with Q, when we actually see Picard in his academy days. Dr. Crusher also in the series makes nostalgic reference to the \\"young lieutenant who had hair\\".<br /><br />Further we have the question of Weasly Crusher. Crusher appears in a Starfleet Uniform... when we last saw Weasly he had abandoned his attempts to get into Starfleet academy and had taken up with the Traveler and was busy leaping time and space.<br /><br />Then you have the data random whatever it is... Data's creator Doctor Noonien Soong clearly is shown in multiple episodes with reference to one and only one other Android in the style of Data. And that android would be Lore. The movie makes absolutely no attempt to reconcile this enormous fallacious hole in continuity and doesn't even seem to realize that the explanation for data's origins have already been provided by canon.<br /><br />Then we have the creation entirely without basis of the so called \\"Remus\\"  people... alright well i can deal with that ... Romulans would have been a whole lot more interesting given their established characteristics and extensive history dating back all the way to the Original series but the Remians were so shallow and not established as to create one of the most laughable villains in the entire history of Trek. Desiring to start an intergalactic war (see dominion war for how anxious all the powers involved would be to see yet another war in the Alpha quadrant) over something as freaking dumb as a blood transfusion has little appeal at all as a interesting story. Its a cop out from the writers from actually using the massive store of material available to generate an actually interesting story true to the canonized content already avalible.<br /><br />The writers failed to learn the single most important lesson from the movie they stole their plot line from. ST TWOK (Wrath of Kahn) was a brilliant integration of the series character of Kahn into a unique and interesting story of revenge. What the writers stole was some lame combat idea which generated the action their producers wanted but left the plot both crippled and uninteresting to the aforementioned people who actually care that things relate to what has been established previously.
B00000JCOV|3.0|At first look I could not stand this band they dressed like a boy band from hell and there was like 30 members.  But I started to listen to the lyrics and Corey Taylor knows what he is doing.  This cd was full of energy and aggresion and very unpolished.  Thier fans are loyal and thier peers are afraid for a while this band ruled the metal scene.
B0002VKZL6|5.0|One of his best collection of songs to date.  As always, very understated and always respectful of the song.  For those of us who love his guitar playing, it is slightly sad that the days of the \\"guitar hero\\" are gone, replaced by a much more folksy/bluesy musician.  While the long solos are gone, he still has the magic to ornment songs with his playing, which is as crisp and melodic as ever. <br /> <br />I've always been attracted to Knopfler's choice of subject matter for his songs and this album really doesn't disappoint.  There are songs about coal miners in the UK (5:15 am), Elvis (Back to Tupelo), MacDonalds (Boom, Like That), Sonny Liston, and the Bush family (Don't Crash the Ambulance).  I have to say that in contrast to one of the other reviewers, I find Don't Crash the Ambulance both interesting and funny - it's not vulgar.  For me, the stand out track is Boom, Like That which I can listen to endlessly. <br /> <br />The muscial style is as diverse as you'd expect, though the blues influence is perhaps stronger than on his previus works.  On Our Shangri-La, Knopfler also sings properly perhaps for the first time on a record, with an impressive range. <br /> <br />In summary, I was really excited by the prospect of listening to these songs and that is usually a recipe for disappointment.  Not this time.  An excellent album, which Knopfler fans will really enjoy though given current trends it's unlikely to make any commercial waves.
B00004RYZT|5.0|I remember when my copy of LaB DVD first came in...I had chills, I couldn't WAIT to get it in my DVD player and on my screen.  My anticipation was amply rewarded.  From first song to last, each one was far more intricate and beautiful than their 2-D album versions.  You could tell the band was giving 1000% of themselves in every note they played, especially rhythm guitarist Paul Landers, who was so sick with flu during the recording of this DVD that he had to be iced down between songs to bring down his raging fever. <br /> <br />I was especially blown away by the live version of Wilder Wein.  The original, demo version I'd previously heard was tinny, and was all synth and lead singer Till Lindemann.  Nevertheless beautiful, but made breathtaking when the three guitarists (the previously mentioned Landers, lead guitarist Richard Kruspe, and bassist Oliver Reidel) joined in on accoustic guitars.  Gorgeous.  Even with sombreros... <br /> <br />This DVD is a MUST HAVE for any Rammstein fan.  To not own it, is like a Christian without a Bible, pointless. <br /> <br />And the extras are unbelieveable!  I especially liked the alternate camera angles option.  To watch my favorite member, up close, through a whole song, without cutting to the others?  GLEE. <br /> <br />In closing, I'd like to make a quick commentary on Amazon's review.  I am deeply disappointed.  I would think a site as well-established as yours would do your reasearch before so grossly mistranslating their song titles.  For shame. <br /> <br />BUY THIS DVD... <br /> <br />I COMPEL YOU! @_@
B00018D44U|1.0|I have just brought a new Norah Jones CD and I can't get the stupid Copy Control Licence agreement stuff to work. I can't play my CD. <br /> <br />What I would also like to know is what happens if my computer is not connected to the internet!!!  <br /> <br />This is ridiculous - I purchase the CD I should be able to play it without being treated like a criminal. I will never buy another CD that has \\"Copy Controlled\\" written on it. <br /> <br />I get a site that says it will go live soon - so what happens to me in the mean time - just wait until you have your site live and then I'm allowed to play my CD - if I purchase something I expect to be able to enjoy it. <br /> <br />VERY UNSATISFIED CUSTOMER <br />Jayne
B000069HK2|5.0|This album and In Love and Death are their best. Havent liked their music after the original drummer left.
B0002IU988|2.0|This cd is the perfect example that you can have a good guitar player , a good bassist , a good drummer , a good singer and still make songs that have no depth.  This cd is very well played but is also very very boring , so before thinking about buying it  listen to the song samples first.  These guys can rock but I just dont like the songs they play, I don't feel them and I think they lack creativity except for the guitar solos and riffs which are really good but that doesn't change the fact that listening to this cd is like listening to some background music. It's like ambient rock music. Check out 'seven wiser' instead , it's less sophisticated but better in my opinion.
B00006V9A0|4.0|I love Nirvana, but where is Breed, Polly (New Wave), On A Plain, Sappy, All Apologies(studio), About A Girl, and Negative Creep?  I don't get it. <br /> <br />Its a really good album, but a lot of quality songs are missing.
1591840562|5.0|I've been there and I'm going there again as an entrepreneur and mentor to new entrepreneurs and this is going to be my first recommended reading for anyone launching a new endeavor, business or otherwise. Get the Art, The Innovator's Solution and Linked, The New Science of Networks and read them all- if you can synthesize, you're going to have a whole new understanding of how business start-ups really work. <br />Read it and then go for it.
B0000VAFO0|3.0|If you are into goth and if you liked The Matrix or the Blade movies you will probably like this movie. Others beware!!! Hollywood has clearly run out of ideas and this movie proves it. Hollywood just loves to beg, borrow and steal and that's what they do with this movie. How many sequels, ripoffs and remakes do we need Hollywood? Enough is enough. Come up with something original!!!!
B0002S947K|5.0|This CD, from both a lyrical and musical standpoint, is simply stunning. Touted as the next Van Morrison, his style is also reminiscent of Ryan Adams' more acoustic, alt-country songs, but tinged with an incredible soulfulness. While it is difficult to explain, Ray L.'s voice is an emotional force, conveying the sincerity and depth of his emotions. He could sing the phonebook and it would make you feel. Simple a gorgeous piece of work.
B000002MTR|5.0|This is by far the most artistically brilliant album, it evokes so many feelings within me. Warped cuts into my soul, its vocal delay effect and the wonderful vocals add to it. Aeroplane has got that rocking feeling, it has the best balance of guitar, and bass, funk and rock, it is my favourite song on the album. Deep Kick is another expert mix of rock and funk, and the guitar is amazing in it.I like My Friends, but it's not one of my favourits, but it has a good acoustic sound.I love Coffee Shop, a cool kind of funk/metal song with a kick ass bass solo at the end.Pea is just plain weird.One Big Mob is weird, it's noisy but with a long quiet section again.Walkabout is a cool chilled groove, with a cool guitar solo.I love Tearjerker, the guitar is beautiful.One Hot Minute is another funk/metal one, and really rocks (play it loud).Falling Into Grace is cool, especially the vocals.Shallow Be Thy Game is a cool rocking one, the guitar and bass go well together. But by far the most artistic is Transcending, it's first mellow section has some amazing lyrics (\\"water flowing and i will drink it, i will drink for you\\") and it makes an amazing transition to being the heaviest song on the album, with dave really doing the guitar so well and anthony's singing really overpowering the listener. Don't leave this album on the shelf because it hasn't got John Frusciante, this album is brilliant, it will change your life for the better (also the album art is incredible).
B00028HBKM|1.0|I've seen many movies dealing with what Jesus Christ was about and had to go through in his life. In all those movies there was always something that could touch people and make them reflect about life. Those movies also showed Jesus' final moments, but what they all miss is the brutal violence and sadism portrayed in this movie. While watching it , having seen all these old movies, I knew exactly what was coming next, even the dialogue, the only difference was all the blood, extreme graphic violence  and sadism this movie is full of.
B00005JKGO|3.0|Anyone who is comparing La Dolce Vita to 8 1/2 and saying it's better or on the same level should have their head examined. <br /> <br />And no as  J. A. Stankunas \\"jonukwho\\"  put it this DVD isn't even close to the quality of the Criterion 8 1/2 DVD.  <br /> <br />People do yourself a favour and stop reading these amateur reviews, if you're not familiar with the film don't buy, rent first and judge for yourselves.
B0002OERI0|1.0|Lyrics... weak, redundant. Music... unoriginal and dronish. Cover art... recycled and predicatable. Reviewer's mood... cranky from being suckered into the hyped-up review that he read for this album. <br /> <br />
