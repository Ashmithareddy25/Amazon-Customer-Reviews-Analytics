B009B9GUFK|5|Works well.  Fit could be a little better on my Volt (taller by 1-2 inches would be nice), but it stays in place well and is reasonably easy to install.  It doesn't fold up very small, but that's okay for my use.  It appears like it will be very durable.
B002JFEETW|1|They broke the 2nd time they were worn. I got what I paid for considering the price.
B002J7VX4Y|1|It's an aroma, but not really that of a new car. More like a harsh chemical scent, fairly irritating actually. Can't recommend it. Not going to use it any more.
B009OBOKRA|5|perfection.  I needed a little extra in my 93 crown vic which has a fan clutch.  I noticed when (in phoenix arizona) I stopped at stop lights etc in 110 degree weather that the ac would start to &#34;warm up&#34;--a little.  The ac could barely keep up anyway, and so stopping or getting tied up in traffic was killer.  I bought a couple different fans, all of them claiming to fit--but none did.  This little fan is the bomb.  Its only about 1&#34; thick---and fits right in front of my condenser.  I bolted it in, then ran the wires---FYI, I bought a derale fan switch which is a relay and temp sensor.  It turns on at 180 OR, when AC is turned on, and works perfect.  The fan is quiet, very powerful, and does the job perfectly.  My AC cools off very quickly and now when I stop The AC continues to blow cold and gets colder.  No more &#34;warming up&#34;.  The fan clutch is good---its new, but its old technology and just doesn't get enough air flowing unless the car ismoving.  If you need a fan and dont have much space---this is the ticket.  NOTE--yOU CANNOT REVERSE TH E BLADES.  SPAL FANS ARE EIther push or pull--SO GET THE RIGHT FAN!!!!<br /><br />Thanks
B00L7TLZQQ|3|They produce a lot more dust than expected, and was suprised  they were made in China.  I will not buy them again
B007TYHR88|4|Good fit and best price I could find, but the motor makes a small crunching sound when the window nears the bottom. Motor noise is a bit louder than the original as well. For the price and the fact that I don't want to open that thing up again, I am fairly pleased.
B0084L5N68|5|Yes. Perfect fit. And great performance

B001ALRQ1E|5|Excellent quality. Works great tying down a jeep on my trailer.
B00KLKZB6M|4|Its’ a very good quality product but  they need to improve  on their order processing time.
B000182EWI|1|Appears to be the wrong one for my vehicle ( 1997 Ford F250 Pickup Truck). The photo shows the approximate correct angle for my doors window, but the Ventshade I got has a much shallower angle. Package is labeled for a 1997 Ford F250. It is not the one for my truck.
B00EA0ZB7I|5|For the Price come it's Super BRIGHT !!! I put them on my rear bumper for people that like to ride my ass at night lol it works awwsumm
B000AA4RWM|3|Kind of flimsy, doesnt add much to what the &#34;bubble&#34; provided by the manufacturer shows.
B000FMLGHE|4|works great! My Volvo doesn't have enough storage for the ladies items- lipstick, lotion, phone, charger,etc. This items works perfect for all of that.
B00FJHTCEO|4|I like it.
B00IQFD2II|5|Fit perfectly and a lot cheaper than any other stores
B00AKA6QC6|5|Very good. I fixed my car.
B0070NG82Y|5|Looks sweet
B00QSFZIMG|5|Box and product both arrived in perfect condition as expected and all the necessary parts to install were included. I've had the UICP installed for about 3 weeks now and i haven't had a problem. I bought the rear UICP mainly because ive read reviews that the stock Front UICP is perfect as is. Why spend and extra $100 with a stock inter-cooler?<br /><br />The turbo lag decrease was noticeable but i also installed this with a turbo inlet pipe and drop in filter both from Cobb so i cant say this part alone is responsible. But the sounds is absolutely incredible. You can really hear the turbo spool now that its getting a smoother flow of air; Sounds great!!!<br /><br /> 5 stars for build quality, delivery, and functionality. Way to go ETS
B00DWVN09C|5|Exactly as described. This is the black valance trailer hitch cover for the FJ Cruiser Trail Teams
B00TD157HI|5|Comes in handy
B00HE8HCAM|5|I am really happy with this tire hoist. Now I can actually use my spare tire. I never knew about the locking device on the original hoist and always had problems removing my spare tire. The original hoist is junk. This hoist doesn't have the awful locking device that never works properly. I would suggest changing out your hoist for one without a locking device.
B0016LE80K|2|didn't work for me to use radar detector and smart phone. Galaxy 6 rejected.
B00150P0O0|5|I have been using these air freshners for years now.  It's great that I can now buy the refills on Amazon.  Sometimes the smell is too strong at first, but you can just cut them in half and they last longer.  Make sure to seal the un-used half in an air tight seal so it doesn't go to waste!
B004809YBE|5|great heavy duty product

B005G8ERDC|5|The decal was perfect
B004R36UXM|5|2013 f350, works perfect easy to install, I used a 2 1/8&#34; hole saw. if you install over bed liner you need 2&#34; screws the ones that come with it are too short.
B000A6TIF2|5|This fit my van perfectly.
B00YCP7EIU|5|This stuff works great for getting fish/bait smell off your hands.  May not get ALL of it, but more than enough, and more than any other product I've tried.  Except for its predecessor, Reel Clean.
B0012TNPLY|1|They are nice bolts yet they aren't gold, they are orange.
B008DREON6|5|Perfect for what I needed.

B00VWJN25I|5|Very nice
B00SI3TEOE|1|It had a hole in it when I got it... Piece of crap china product
B00BG8U8P2|2|This device is very well made. This will keep my trailer safe from any snatch and grab thief. It will take a lot of time and effort to get this lock off.
B00I8OFWU8|1|This item was marketed as fitting for force 70 hp outboard's. I waited for the item to arrive which came on time however the item was not a replacement for the original part it was a thinner impeller didn't fit. Had to find an impeller through boating parts website.
B00F2B80YK|1|doesnt work
B001N72FES|2|bolt not long enough to screw into side post on a Deca battery had to get a new bolt, easu install after that. seems to be working as advertised.
B00FDRLJW8|5|Fit perfect in 2009 Fit and resolved the fan-only-works-on-4 issue.  Replaced this with Issyzone Blower Motor Resistor Transistor 79335TF0G01.
B0083Z2S7M|3|The only thing wrong with it is that there is not enough clearaced between the nob and mounting bracket - my knucles hit the bracket(it hurts).
B00GYDBPL0|5|Looooooove!!!!!
B00OD91N3M|5|Just what I ordered and just what I needed!

B00VW0KHNM|5|Purchased for use on a Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD and it attached as the OEM unit would and I see no difference in the reception.
B00CTRRP14|5|Just like the original.
B00JUALRM6|5|Worked well thanks
B004JVBLS6|3|fade too quickly
B00FDGVMVW|1|I bought this as a replacement antenna for my car and it never worked so I bought another one from Walmart and even though it looks terrible it works better than this one.
B00MBFAXMC|5|Great!
B0089XO4AM|5|Works great
B00KTHY3F2|5|Works great. Perfect solution to my broken key FOB. Worked fine, but keyhole was broken. Easy to install.
B000CFAV7U|1|Nothing fit. Had to trim every peice. Said it would fit my 2000 Blazer?  Said I needed no tools?  That was not right at all.  Think these were knock offs. Didn't even look like the pictures on Amazon?  Not satisfied at all.  If I could give a negative I would.
B002LNI8GW|5|They work.
B007UTNTYS|5|Excellent pads.  Perfect fit and function.  Quiet.
B0016IKXL6|5|Works great!
B007I6Z05Y|5|This lock was incredibly easy to install and just as described. It fit on my 2015 Wrangler Unlimited Sport perfectly. I'm a first time Wrangler owner, and a novice when it comes to working on cars (I'm getting better!), and this was a SUPER easy install for me. The grill is much easier to remove than I anticipated (videos online if needed). Once the grill is off, move the tube that houses the wires out of the way, and then it's just a matter of using the bolts to cut threads in the existing holes and then secure the hood lock in place per instructions. No special tools required. I just used a flat head screwdriver to remove the grill plugs and a ratchet and 1/2&#34; bit for the lock bolts. Replace the tube and grill and you're good to go! Now I feel better knowing my Wrangler is protected (since it sits outside), and I plan on hiding the lock with a grill guard. Thanks for this product! It's way less expensive than others and I don't mind that it's not keyed to my ignition.
B00SJTHPNO|4|Great visor system, good feel, size runs a bit small, most likely it will loosen up with wearing it.
B00498MM7I|5|Came on time and great value
B002EIE3K4|5|Sounds good and noticed a higher mpg only 2 or 3 more but still pretty good and super easy to install
B009QT1KLO|5|This is all using in baby youmy new Toro lawn mower very happy
B0049Z11NC|4|Works fine
B00D2HH844|4|That's all right
B0009NWQWI|5|nice

B00GHT5Q7A|5|Fit perfectly and was a perfect replacement.
B008G32B1O|5|Fits exactly like the original OEM with no adjusting needed. I highly recommend this product!
B00I250MIU|5|very functional and stylish, they look great.
B00U8OTU3Q|5|Heavy duty piecies that work very well for various auto applications. Used various tools to hardwire dash cam and radar detector. Was able to fit wires around and under trim using these tools. Made installation much easier.
B006HAKOW6|2|One mirror won't tighten enough to stay in place while riding
B0024E6E3C|4|Fit good great price. Will see how long they hold up
B003AW2YWW|4|Everything okay except for the two large upper control arm bushings. The are tapered, the arm port is not. Had to modify it a bit to keep from binding like OEM bushings.
B00XAX4B9A|5|Works great!
B00T6JH7M0|5|I have a 2015 HD Roadking with Kuryakyn taillight #5437 and turn signal #5444 installed. At this time Kuryakyn doesn't have a run,brake and turn module for 2014-15 model years. I purchased this Triple Play from Custom  Dynamics and installed it and it works with the Kuryakyn LEDs. I have no trouble  codes thus far and my alarm still works. Im pleased  but not happy about the price. I would recommend  this product.
B00J5SYYLY|5|worked like a charm for my 2001740il. solid there for no alignment was needed either. 36 dollars well spent
B00DSGG2LE|5|Depicted as outboard cv but it is the inboard. Should have cross referenced numbers just be aware.
B00H9FM8UE|4|I installed these on my 2013 F350.  The instructions are fairly generic with very small pictures and not many detailed instructions for each step.  I had to remove large steel bumper supports on both sides. My package had the correct number of nuts but I was short half of the allen head bolts.  Luckily the LED light hardware used the same bolt size so I was able to scavenge bolts from the light hardware to use on the bracket install.  The Rigid street legal lights I paired with these brackets are a bright white and seem brighter than stock.  The build quality and fit/finish are great. More comprehensive instructions for this vehicle specific item would be nice.
B00A9OCFXW|5|Fast  service,  A 5***** (star)
B0006IX7WY|5|Does what it is designed to do.  Must have item for RV frige.
B005LGTSMO|5|Easy-to-use. Worked like a charm. Although I never did this type of work before I was able to installed it with no hassle. Then, the price is better than expected.
B001N4QY66|5|It works as expected.
B007BLMVPS|5|perfect for my 02 explorer.
B001FDEEM6|5|works well. oem quality at a good price
B000P1R5NE|5|best brake cleaner there is
B005OJ3RSO|3|It definitely made my 2003 F250 look much sharper.  That part I love!<br /><br />However, it feels a bit cheap when holding it in hand.  When its on the truck though, it looks great.  Does not look cheap at all once its mounted.  With that, I would give it 4 stars.<br /><br />The reason for 3 stars is because of the fitment.  It bolted right in, however, there's no clips on the bottom. It literally looks like all the bottom tabs were broken off, so I'm not sure if that is the case, or if that's how it comes...  So since there are no bottom tabs, the bottom feels a bit loose and you can easily move it about an inch back and forth by hand, since nothing is holding on to it from the bottom.  Even that is not a huge issue, as the top is sturdy enough.  The main issue that I have is that the gap between the grill and hood on the passenger side is bigger than on the drive side.  Its not noticeable from 10 feet away, but from 5 feet it is definitely noticeable when you pay attention to the fitment.  Once it catches your eye, that is all you see...<br /><br />I thought to return this grille, but my stock one was cracked, and I did not want to wait to return this, then wait for a refund, and then wait longer for another grille.  Again, this grille does make the truck look pretty sharp, and for the price I can't complain too much about the fitment.  I just hoped it would be a perfect fit...
B00KTJ8D38|2|There should have been a warning that you need to take these to a dealer to operate
B00067BWBI|5|Very loud. Nice tone
B00F4PB8QQ|5|It arrived with a defective pump, the contents dribbling out from the pump handle. What I was able to try is a completely inferior product when compared to Zanio's or even Mother's detail spray products.<br />Garbage....one star only because it's the lowest rating allowed<br />Ok, I was a bit upset that the first time I used it the spray trigger exploded in my hand and all over the place, so that first review was a bit of an emotional one. I have used it since and have to admit it is as easy to use with similar results as the Zaino product I have used extensively in the past, good product, sorry for the over reaction...
B0009ZEVJC|5|Great product and great price for Air Filter that is not often stocked at your neighborhood auto parts stor.
B00RM7X7YU|3|Advertisement says a &#34;set&#34; of bushings and the picture shows two bushings. Only one bushing received, This is pathetic shady advertising, Part received is fine.
B000HE2VF6|5|The right tool for the job at a great price
B012IIZPBA|5|Great product! Love the way it looks on my car. They even sent me custom decals that match. Very cool!
B00B4KTH90|5|Works perfectly! Easy to install when you google the  Youtube video.  Use blue tape to hold window while you work and for easy cleanup.
B001VYO9JC|1|very thin and tore from fingers going through it trying to put it on
B00BJN00RK|5|Satisfied with this product. Works like a charm

B009383DCW|5|it did its job ,,satisfied with purchase ,,, i went to ask to a motorsport shop for pricing and they told me i would have to pay 60$ ... this was totally a bargain
B00BCRMBGQ|2|Didn't fit the back seat of my 2015 forester. The front covers fit but look cheap and not fitted. The instructions were very hard to follow and not written well. Would not buy again.
B001G7GSI4|5|Tried to go cheaper through an alternative route. But the fit was terrible. This one was WAY better. Fit was great. Worth the extra couple bucks.
B00062ZJ4O|5|Very good product. Easy to use.
B010RHWKJY|2|not quite as sturdy as I expected.  The cooler gets smushed by whatever you put in the pockets in front.  Also not sure if I strapped on the bottom strap correctly as it barely fit around the seat.  Also the top is one pocket not separate mesh pockets.
B0013FW7VG|5|Perfect fit for 2001 Chevy Express 2500 with 8-Lug (4L80E transmission).
B00N160W1M|3|it was nice but the sticker didn't stick well and i ended up throwing it away maybe something happened to it during the shipping?
B00WUPEFN6|5|Came in mail quick. All the tools you need to lay down some tint great price.
B008R0EBTG|5|I call it boat trailer grease
B00EC0Z4XM|4|This mirror would be best described as a temporary fix for you Ford vehicle.  There are some optical oddities with the mirror.  I get the feeling you definitely need the mounting hardware off of your old/broken mirror.  The instructions weren't really for my application.  It is getting my by for now until I buy a complete unit.
B00P5YOU3O|4|I added a little glue to be sure they stay in place in bad weather.
B000ZIZ32W|4|It's made for battery posts, but you NEED this thing for pulling the wiper arm (or what's left of it after that piece of crap snapped off like a twig when you lifted it 2&#34; to knock ice of it) off the rear of your GMC Acadia.<br /><br />Don't give the GM Service counter any more money for this simple job.  Do it yourself at home.
B0032A60W2|1|First, the buttons on ths tool are not &#34;intuitive&#34; as your advertising says.  But worse, the applied torque window will not clear. pushing every permutation of buttons will not change it from reading 25,5 ft#.  Worse yet, when I set the target torque (flashing) to, say, 35 ft#, push the mystery button (memory--which seems to have no relationship at all to memory)--the target torque stops flashing, and the wrench simply will not display any torque readings at all.  No subsequent pushing of buttons will remedy this.  It flatly refuses to read torque, no matter what I do.
B005GEJUZQ|5|As described
B001FJDAZC|5|Exact fit and works great. Remove 2 screws from the existing handle and replace.
B00CSZ129S|5|Fits perfectly in the KIA Rondo
B00X4UG88Q|5|Very cute! One of the cap covers didn't fit properly so I had to use a little bit of glue, other than that it's perfect!
B00FKPJHIQ|4|These things are pretty bright for the price. Haven't failed yet
B0023SUXPE|5|work perfect on my ford f-350 3500 diesel 7.3
B00HJDY6PG|5|Net fits perfect, it's helped alot already.  Would defenitly order from this seller again
B0012ZEZ8A|5|This is a nice kit for taking care of your car. Especially like the Scratch X-20 as it hid the fine scratches that were on our black car.
B00GG2P5GK|5|As described
B004YRES30|5|Package was left out in the rain by the carrier and the adhesive properties were still great.<br /><br />Looks good. The picture is actually a --really-- accurate size comparison.
B006B22D74|5|Amazing product came with everything needed to swap out the old parts with the new. Petcock  Dosnt leak gas anymore like it used too. Definitely recommend. Even arrived earlier than expected. Very satisfied. Will buy again in future.
B00877SL2M|5|very good light bulb
B008M7SVBS|3|Good!
B00BGH1XH0|5|Good cheap glasses, these fit an adult face better than the originals and block wind adequately.
B00DSVMCQS|5|Really nice! Feels great and keeps everything from flapping in the wind. Size was spot on for me and the size is adjustable with the side laces, you can even tighten the top and loosen the bottom if you have a gut or do the opposite if you're in shape besides round. Love the brass snaps on black leather..
B00KTJ3ZMW|5|I had no issues I got it cut at a local locksmith for 2 bucks 30 seconds later it was turning on my car very satisfied! I have a 2009 ford fusion SEL
B00498ZR7A|3|I installed these on my 2005 Cadillac Escalade. There's definitely a raise and ride height but they seem a little softer than z71 springs should be
B001DRI5LA|5|Great air filter. The OEM one was still in working condition, but this filter made a notable difference in performance.
B009OBVRY4|5|Best tool I have now ! Makes polishing my black 2012 Charger or my black 1968 Ford Torino the easiest I have ever had. I coupled this with a DeWalt 18 volt angle drill to make a high speed cordless buffer.
B001N1E9Y8|2|looks real nice paints okay not professional by any means but it deff gets the job done
B002M477C6|2|Bulb quality is not good at all.
B0052FRX9E|2|Didn't fit without modifying...had to use locking button from existing handle because the new handle locking button wouldn't move freely once in gaged with switch....
B004VPLX1K|5|They've lasted about 2 1.2 years now and are finally wearing out. If I was still into the color pink like I was then I'd order them again.
B009DK166K|5|Good seller good product
B003880XLM|5|It works for my 99-04 Mustang, it's a pain getting on tho. Hope you get the holes centered or your steering rack will be off centered... Good if plan on driving in a Nascar race and only plan on making a left turn. So 5 starts for that.
B0002S9X30|2|Too loose fitting on my 2000 jeep wrangler so I returned them for a full refund. I actually put one on with the top off and when I got in the seat was so hot it burned me.
B00DM8N7R0|5|Got the matte black decal. Fits perfectly and matches the surrounding plastic like it came OEM.
B00CW6HTTK|5|Great stuff really happy i got this
B000EDUTX6|5|works great!! I recommend this for all my camper friends!
B000IYHENE|5|I saw a video on YouTube on how to replace this on my 2007. The video said some plugs may vary on the 06-08 models. The only difference was the one plug on this item that you can see in the pic which was I simply unplugged the old one and plugged in the new one once ready. This item fit perfect, seems well made and works perfect. Took me about an hour to install and saved me about $225 in labor. Again, most importantly, it fit perfect!
B00WRUIQKC|3|Almost perfect fit
B00873J0YY|4|Decent quality for the cost but I would consider a better set if I wanted something to use long term.
B009OXCY12|5|I love moog parts work perfect on my 2004 dodge sprinter van
B00BAZ1DDM|4|Doesnt fit perfect but its ok. Does the job
B005GHU890|3|It's as perfect fit as I had hoped it would be.  Mounted and functions just fine, its more generic than specific.  It works just fine.
B004XH7J1Y|5|Fast shipping great product
B000630J8E|5|makes quick work of ring filing...sturdy base
B00C7RZ66M|5|great OE part for half the price of OEM BMW part
B005GLQCKA|5|Works perfect on 2009 toyota hilux imv
B000E0R6JY|4|I purchased this shade for my 2007 Mercedes ML 350.  It works very well for keeping the sun out of the windshield, and it covers the entire windshield perfectly.  It fits so well in fact, that learning how to get it in just the right places (in the corners and under the rearview mirror) was a little tricky at first, because it fits so tight (perhaps even a little too tight)!  The only thing I don't like about this shade is that it rolls up into a cylindar, which is pretty bulky and hard to store.  It would have been better if it folded flat (like so many other sunshades do), so it could be stored in smaller places when not in use!  And because it is tough to store, I usually end up throwing it in the back and then forgetting to use it when I park the next time.  Therefore, I give this product 4 stars - It is defintiely fitted for a 2007 ML350 and works very well for it's primary purpose, but storing it in my car is difficult!
B009ITE9O2|3|Not bad at all.  Seems to work fairly well.
B00X1XAUH6|5|great value, very bright and definatly worth the money would definatly buy again
B0040HD0XS|5|I've used this polisher a few times now and I couldn't be happier with the performance and the ease of handling it is. You won't find a better polisher for the money and the accessories that this one comes with.
B001KQ43BU|5|It was exactly the part I needed for my vehicle and it got here on time.
B00G6II1VU|2|I had high expectations after reading the reviews, however this product in Navy blue did not work well at all for me. I followed all instructions and even referenced their website for additional tips. I was using it to restore color to 30yr old door panels that were faded.  No matter how close or far I held the nozzle, multiple coats, the dye just never took or gave even coverage. I let it dry, sanded off what didn't absorb and Resprayed it with Duplicolor Vinyl and Fabric spray which worked perfectly and was half the price.
B000K8O4E0|5|i bought this for a friend who had one and lost it he wanted another one and couldn't find it so I got it for him and he was happy good deal.
B00230MXIW|3|Clean look
B008RATBPK|1|Junk. The individual LEDs in the light started flickering after 3 months. Extremely annoying.
B001H494DC|4|Great, reliable product that was delivered on time as promised
B009V0CY9K|5|Works great, nice bright light easy install with kuryakyn relay harness
B003AOFRRY|5|Looks great.  May have to use a little WD-40 to get the caps on.  Make sure you line it up so there are no gaps where the screw holes are located.
B000NUCO4M|5|Exact match.
B0012ETJ1O|1|These don't last. I have now replaced them 3 times in about a year. Wish I could find another type for my Prius.
B00K8E0WAG|5|The battery runs a 12 volt fan 6 hours each night to keep my log term food storage area cool.
B002K66FYW|5|Installed them today not too bad , had blue hids before but the white is actually not bad either I give them a thumb up..
B00BCRM9RM|4|The seams pull easily but they do the trick for the money spent!
B00OU5LOT2|5|Complete package! This is a true all inclusive kit. The kit came with mounting brackets, swabs to wipe mounting surface, plenty of zipties (2 types of lengths, key & standard remote (with batteries & screwdriver to install on key FOB, all 3 types of Add-a-fuse adapters AND they were already pre-spliced with connectors, 4  cables with plenty of length, easy to follow instructions & a cig adapter. I am super pleased with the value of whats included. I opted for the &#34;cleaner install&#34; and connected to the driver fuse box. It took me 2.5 hrs to complete the installation. Most of that install time was spent figuring out how and where I wanted to mount the strips and struggling to get both of my arms under the seats to mount and run wiring. I have a 2014 Accord EX-L sedan and ran all my wires under the carpet and trim moldings securing them to the existing OEM wiring with electrical tape or zips. I will probably remount the front passenger strip. Ill probably retrofit it to get better placement. Not a product fault but rather Honda design for that area. I will update if I encounter any issues but as of right now I am SUPER pleased with this product. BTW- I agree, music &#34;pulse&#34; is kinda crappy but it strobes cool lol
B0008FUH46|1|Key broke off inside after 3x of use.... Cheap crap
B00HLK77YO|1|DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!<br />I was happy when I installed this product, as the installation was very easy. I've only had this product less than 6 months and the pins inside have broken a couple of times. The lock ALWAYS gets stuck. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. This product SUCKS!
B00RUDYQDM|2|Pad bent almost right away.
B010UE8Q38|1|If I could give this zero stars, I would. It absolutely doesn't fit in a GLA250. More so, the cut out for your cable is too small for the factory cable installed in the vehicle. Piece of garbage!
B00DX87R3Y|1|I bought this so I could start doing my own oil changes. It simply doesn't fit.<br /><br />I have my ninja 300 in my &#34;Amazon Garage&#34; that filters products by vehicle and this product is listed as one that fits. In the description it is also listed for my bike.
B00WMK6Z46|5|Excellent and strong for any car use. I like it.
B009XUZF9O|5|Bolted right up to my 2001 XJ.  Build quality looked as good or better than the unit it was replacing and have had no issues for the first 1,000 miles since installed.
B00A89J040|5|very well designed-fit perfectly in minutes
B00IABCJS2|5|Perfect replacement part for the one that went AWOL during our recent 2500 mile trip.  I'll try to keep the vent closure tabs locked while driving in the future.
B00NRLCJPI|5|Extremely well made metal badge looks like genuine BMW product - A great buy at this price.
B00R7ORS34|5|Excellent product. High quality. It allows me to torque the rear axle on my Harley.
B0063I8GMC|5|Looks great, light-weight aluminum bagde to go on my 99 Civic where the original had been taken off by a previous owner.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Fits perfectly!
B004J86RTC|3|Not sure if it was just the ones i got, but they were out of round when replacing. I did both drums and shoes and they vibrated when braking.  Front rotors and pads don as well.  I did a test with ebrake that confirmed to be rear. I just picked up new drums locally and vibration went away.  I gave it 3 stars because amazon was great with the refund. 5 stars for amazon. No stars for the product.  But could just be an old batch.
B0068ETQUW|5|Love them. Add to the look and good size
B012EH4VPQ|5|All I expected it to be.  It leaves my Honda Pilot so much cooler inside.
B000B8JUNY|5|Great fuel, fits a 1992 Honda Civic had to replace my old one since the seal it was starting to crack.
B00O7TMTBI|1|Arrived broken.
B008S9LEU0|5|good.
B00HMG8QHE|5|This works much better than expected. This one is rated at 102db and the 107db would be too loud. Tried another brand I purchased a few years back and sounded like a kiddie horn, this one will not disappoint. Installed an in line switch to shut off when not needed such as late at night backing into yard.<br />Main reason for installing is for backing out of parking spaces in parking lots. Even though the truck has dual cat back exhaust people do not pay attention. This will get their attention!
B00MPQ3CZ2|5|I was impressed with the quality and appearance of this product.  Solid welds, great powder coated finish.  I could not make this myself for less money  nor as good.  Built to last a long time and much heavier than my little subcompact tractor will ever need.
B00J9G6P0K|5|Looks great
B00KQUWUZW|5|This works perfectly.  Eliminates the hyper flash without adding load resistors.  I am running LED in the rear and OEM halogens bulbs in the front with no problems.  There is a slight pause (just under a second I think) before it begins to flash for either turn signal or hazard lights.  I highly recommend this instead of load resistors where you lose all the power savings of LEDs and have to splice into the wiring.  This is a very fast and easy unplug and plug.  Takes about 5 mins to install.  (I have a 2002 Toyota Camry)
B00H92WZLE|5|PERFECT!!!
B000FW7VFK|5|Worked great in my '00 Softail Deuce.
B0052YDXRQ|5|fits great!!!
B008H6CDEK|4|Item was smaller then expected; but works
B000F5ED4O|5|Needed the right tools for a drum brake job. Made the job go so much smoother.
B00067BYGG|5|Nice looking wiper blade. With the water repellant you can drive through a monsoon with your wipers on low or med. They start to fade and flake after a year. At this price point it’s expansive but worth if for the look and of course they work.
B005F9IM42|1|The temperature sensor does not fit tightly in this part which causes it to leak antifreeze. The O rings that came with the kit are useless for the sensor. I would buy the motorcraft part instead of this one.
B00TJ6FUWO|1|I installed this unit ( I do not yet have a Volt) . To keep track of usage I put an electric meter in line ( just like the kind used by the electric company*). The power to the unit was on , but no charging was done. After a week of doing nothing but lighting up the little orange LED on top, it used 8 kWH. That is a huge phantom load<br /><br />That's roughly 46 Watts doing absolutely nothing. I'm going to put in a cut off switch near the unit so that I can reduce this loss
B00B1VBQRS|5|Works great<br />Had some idle problems cuase of my injectors but all clean niw thanks to this stuff
B00A4542H8|5|This wax is easy to use and I have been getting great results​.
B003V5PEQG|5|Fits perfectly
B00NPIUFMM|4|Nice and hella bright, but the turnsignal flash isn't as noticeable as the stock halogen.<br />I went LED to be seen, hope to see an improved model soon.
B001AIZ5HY|4|Polished up the fogging on our Mazda headlights. Nice and easy with my drill. Instruction specify colors to determine which pads to use. PAY ATTENTION to the print on the pads as mine were all white and you had to read for the grain levels
B00KTHXLIC|4|This works for 2001 Camry.<br /><br />Instruction found from internet:<br /><br />Programming spare keys: for 1998 to 2002<br /><br />1.. Copy the cuts of the original working key onto the appropriate<br />transponder blank.<br /><br />2.. Enter the car and close all of the doors.<br /><br />3..

B00K889FCI|5|Just used it. It works great. I could hardly see the headlights before I applied WIPE NEW. Now, I can see the headlight and the lamp is much stronger. It works just as advertised. Very satisfied. I'm going to buy one for my ex-wife and clean up her headlamp leases, too. Before I did anything, I went online and watched a video first. It helped.
B00UGO2RR4|5|Came fast was is cute. Made a great inexpensive  anniversary gift for my husband. He put it on his work keys and it seems to holding up
B011GWN0ZC|5|My friend's daughter is just learning to drive, and it's driving her dad crazy, so I got this magnet and several other &#34;student driver&#34; magnets for her car, but while her dad is in the car, this is the magnet that's clinging to the hood. While he clings to the dash and uses his imaginary brake at every corner and stop sign. He said every time he's in the car with her, people read the magnet and he can see them laughing in their cars, which makes him feel ever-so-slightly better about having to face his own mortality in such a tangible way. I received this magnet at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review.
B00DJ7JKE8|1|RCA cable's cut in and out once installed in my car. Actual cables looked durable and fine though. I purchased new cables from RadioShack and they worked fine and also did not have interference.  I would not recommend this product.
B00KTHWHF0|5|It's a great key fob.
B006YTRMMA|4|These locks work great, they seem a bit loose until you click them into locked position.<br /><br />I use them on my trailer and my tie down boxes. All keys worked.<br /><br />Great lock
B000765MHI|1|This is the worst fan and don't buy it.  I bought one and within a month it broke, Amazon replaced it and within 6 weeks it broke again.  This is supposed to be the best truck fan according to it's packaging, this is the worst truck fan.
B001O0AHZS|5|This was perfect for putting on 2014 Honda Accord sports wheels on my 2007 Accord.
B004W4OQ4Q|1|is really bat item take water inside and they bring me my money back
B00X6EZ0IE|2|Units looked great once installed. They seem sturdy enough to do their job should I need to be pulled from the track. Problem is that after a month the front unit is rusting. I leave them in between track events as the front unit is time consuming to put in. I didn't (and don't think I should) expect it to rust in a month. I contacted the seller thru Amazon and have had no response. For the price and sturdiness these could be a 5-star item.
B0041LN1L4|5|When it comes to driving and parking in NYC, is like a zoo. People have no regard for your property (or theirs) and consider your bumper a method for determining when they have to stop their vehicle while backing into a parking spot. But, they might be inclined to continue to back-up, as they pretend that they didn’t feel the first time they hit your bumper.  They will also not leave a note or insurance information if any damages occurs. I wanted to protect my car, but not make it look like a spaceship. I wanted some to protect my front bumper, as that’s the part that they most commonly hit. I found this item.<br /><br />I have had this product for a couple of years, but never actually saw my car been hit to access the quality of the product. This product appealed to me because it’s the least bulky.<br /><br />Yesterday was that day. While parked inside my car, an idiot backed up to get out of parking space and hit my front bumper. The hit was significant enough to shift my car back.  My car was intact and I was very grateful for it. This<br /><br />The bumper pad is made from a rubber material with an additional lip that protects the top of the license plate. It is easy to Install, as easy putting on a license plate.<br /><br />We don’t like the branding on the item, so, we  used sand paper to sand off the Red and White Shox brandname.<br /><br />I highly recommend it.
B0057GFX9A|4|I for some reason thought these would come with a cool sticker for my tool box... I was let down on that front, that being said these plug wires work great! Would purchase again in a heartbeat!!!
B000765E08|5|Perfect fit!! Took about 20 minutes to install on my 2000 Wrangler Sport. No drilling required! Bolted right on. Looks great and works great!
B0041TU4BG|4|This part fit perfectly for my 2003 Mazda 6. I've only had it in place for about a month, but so far so good
B00G1Y3DQC|5|These are great why spend $100+ for pretty much the same thing!!! Shipping came faster than they estimated. I highly recommend this product
B00QWSNIT4|1|Garbage no smell just a waste of monney
B001IGE6ZK|5|perfect
B00G6KGPFM|5|Great Stuff
B005G5R5LQ|5|This only works with the VP racing jugs, unless you are modifying another jug...<br /><br />Works great, no leaks, the top can seize itself on sometimes... Just use some vice-grips and it comes right off.
B0065SIPBC|5|Looks great--not flimsy
B00BQAL016|1|Seemed to leave an oily residue that actually attracted dust. It immediately washed off after the first wash. Did nothing to protect the surface or wax that had been put on prior. Another chemical guys hyped up product.
B00HR26TOU|5|Outstanding mini-upgrade to my 2015 WRX, and totally worth it.  Simple install...truly plug and play with no mods required(other than pulling out the old bulbs)...just go to youtube if you need help accessing the lights.  And the light the bulbs produce is an incredibly bright blueish white light that actually illuminates the entire cabin and trunk versus the pathetic OEM bulbs.  The license plate lights are a nice touch too.
B000Q0VCC4|5|Looks and works as expected.
B002JV0W74|5|Fit perfect as advertised. Great job of keeping the heat out.
B00OSZ2N08|5|Great size and can be cleaned which is a plus. Excellent customer service from vender.
B00B2YHFO2|5|Used these to replace some of the interior lights on a M3 & X3 BMW
B00BD4YPEY|4|No complaints for what  I paid for.
B0029XES2W|5|It is perfect, exactly what I wanted.
B00CZG6WO0|5|I purchased a single from eBay as a test, and came to Amazon to buy mulitples. Make sure you are paying attention when ordering the *color* of the lights. Make sure you like the color and make sure you order all the same color! I accidentally ordered some different.<br /><br />These are some of the best quality LED replacement fixtures I have found...and for a really decent price.<br /><br />I have purchased (10) of these fixtures so far and am very very happy with the money spent. The color is natural, the brightness very high, and the energy usage is much lower than the old car bulbs that had been installed. I realize the car bulb is easily replaced and cheap, but use a ton of energy and get very hot!<br /><br />You will be very pleased if you purchase these!<br /><br />Note: The lens of this fixture casts a bit of an odd *shadow* of sorts. I only noticed because I was shining the light on something white and noticed some really faint yellowing of the white. I thought it was a stain at first but then realized it was the clear lens of the light fixture casting these *shadows*.<br /><br />Not really an issue, but may bother some.
B00FXSHCR8|5|Worked great
B00EFTP2YQ|5|Finally, after tried so many double side adhesive tape, 3M VHB is the only one that's holding up under California sun in summer, 140F+ inside the car, all my other tapes melt in a few days. This one is holding my dashboard camera for months now.
B008VL2PZS|5|Super
B0070Y34U2|5|Nice look clean look looks a little darker than 50% but im not complaining
B0041PXMIM|5|The risers are a quality made product, however I did have to do some minor modifications to make them work. On my 2006 Suzuki V-Strom DL650 I had to remove the holddown clamp on the front brake hose to create enough slack in it and also reroute the throttle cables from over the handlebar to under it in order to create enough slack so that the throttle cables wouldn't bind when the handlebar was turned all the way to the right. Other than that, it was a pretty straightforward installation.
B005DSOENI|5|Great
B000BLNTQU|4|Pretty nice for the price.  Bulbs last a couple of years
B000COC67E|5|Really helps out in the garage and saves the knees.  Good way to keep the tools you are using at hand.
B003EAOSME|2|They are not as brite as a comparable Sylvania by a long shot.  I would not buy again.
B00GSMXXOO|5|Nice LED flood lights for price. Provides nice flood pattern to light up area about 25 feet in front of auto.
B001CA9CN8|3|Plastic piece only and no filter material
B000GRXM02|5|Shipped fast, Works fine.  if you don't want your relocated lights sticking out like the factory ones you must have these to bring them &#34;in from left field&#34; (tighter to the bike)  wish they screwed into metal instead of plastic but they work, just don't over tighten them!
B00SS1BO62|5|Perfect transaction and worked great for our road trip!
B006X8BATI|5|So far so good.  Easy to install.  Based on others review, I went to the hardware store and spent a couple bucks extra for good stainless steel hardware.  I did not even bother with the provided junk.
B003BZD03K|5|Works well
B006K8VI7A|5|Timken grease for bearing
B00B2AFCJG|5|Works as advertised, great kit.
B000TYFWY6|5|Works like a champ on my '98 Jeep Cherokee (XJ).
B00FJUZY8Y|5|great
B007Q1F4LQ|1|Didn't fit 2005 Sierra 150&#34;
B00CH6T18C|5|Saved my $4000 purse!
B00K7IETZ2|5|Fantastic kit, highly recommend this as piece of mind if you're installing a SYE kit into your transfer case as it contains all of the bearings, shift fork pads, and seals you need (except the transmission to transfer case seal).
B002XL2HVO|3|It was longer than our RV drawer but my husband shortened the front down by cutting it and now it fits perfect!
B004TIY5A0|5|Very good quality although my teenage daughter is horrified at the thought of having this on the car since it's &#34;not cool&#34; but drivers back off and are more respective with this on.
B00RW1CF4Y|5|Excellent product and Vendor!
B00068XCQU|5|Does a great job
B00029XH36|5|Awesome for my dads ice cream truck
B0012TYX9W|5|Cheap little device, but it works great.
B003JLLPOW|3|Missing straps
B008FHWYEA|5|Great product....Performed very well....met its expectations!!!!
B002TTU96A|1|Have had the Rotopax on my Jeep for one year.  Never used.  Went to remove gas can and neither of the two keys would unlock the lock.  Called Rotopax.  &#34;Out of warranty, out of luck.&#34;  Not even, a &#34;Hey, we are sorry, let's see if we can help you out.&#34;  Never, ever buying anything from these people again.  I suggest you do not also.
B000TLL8QK|5|Fast shipping and just what I needed.  These gaskets are the best quality I have seen for mopar w-2 headers.
B000C17GUY|1|its been a year and less than 3000 miles on my 99 tj and the headers have cracked by the flex seals. now back to square one!!!
B010PSKDFI|5|20 jumps before charge is a bold claim....HOPEFULLY I will never have to find out. With that said. This is a must for anyone with a car that drives a lot. You honestly never know when you will need a jump and people are getting scarier and scarier :( I like this for a couple of reason. obviously, the ability to jump my car. But the unit also has an extremely powerful and bright flashlight bilt it and it has three modes to help in a roadside emergency. and it charges just about anything you can thing of! Way to go Aukey, another solid device!  Watch my review here  Aukey Car Jump Start Kit With 12000 mAh Power Bank: https://youtu.be/dRN3wuQpk2s
B0068FYANO|3|I'm not entirely happy with this product.  I am just now throwing in the trash my second set of these sensors, and I'm shopping for a similar system from some other manufacturer.  My first set I used for about 15,000 miles before sensor #3 stopped sending accurate info to the receiver.  My second set lasted about 5000 miles before sensor #1 started sending false info.  Admittedly, I beat the hell out of my sidecar rig on rough logging roads and fire roads, so maybe these sensors would last longer on a trike or sidecar rig that's used exclusively on nice smooth pavement.  But, I expected more.  (Yes, I have metal valve stems.)  When it's working, it works extremely well.  And the batteries last a very long time--at least a year.  But I have a couple of other nits besides the lack of ruggedness.  First, the receiver is not waterproof.  If you want to velcro mount it somewhere on your bars, you'll need to protect it from rain.  My first unit got wet any number of times, and it still worked but looking at the display was like looking into a fish tank because the whole case was full of water.  The other nit is that even when it's new, sometimes the sensors and the receiver start communicating right away after you turn on the unit and roll the wheels a bit, but sometimes it takes 15 minutes or longer for all three wheels to start showing up in the display.  Frustrating when you want to know first thing in the morning if you lost any air overnight.
B004OK77L2|4|We purchased this jack in September 2014 and it worked exactly 3 times.  We tried to contact the distributors but they were of no help.  Finally we contacted Husky directly.  We spoke to a very professional and knowledgeable representative who listened to our frustration.  She  said she thought it was a grounding issue.  She made a suggestion to correct the matter and assured us that she would be happy to replace the unit if that didn't work.  The suggestion worked perfectly.  Now we are very happy with the performance of the produce.  I think it would be a help to future users if this information would be included in the installation manual.
B000BZXT0W|5|Seem to be very good rotors for the price. Paired with 105.077 Posi-Quiet ceramic pads, break-in took about 3 miles with a little grit and grumbling in that period, afterwhich the brakes have been smooth as silk, with zero sound and zero pulsation. Rotors have polished very evenly and without grooving, and are smooth enough now that you can read my watch in the reflection. You truly cannot ask anymore from either of these parts for the price.
B00HWRJ4M4|1|Already broken
B001N0D60C|5|My daughter wanted a rabbit's foot so I bought her this.
B000C9NYC0|5|Fits right in, fixed my belt slipping low amp for alternator on my 2001 deville
B00CDXBFHO|4|worked great to cover up some scratches on bumper
B00RE4HZOO|5|The finish is very nice, no chips or imperfections that you might see on lesser quality parts. It was surprisingly difficult to find aftermarket turn signal brackets that clamp to &#60;41mm fork tubes. Most brackets I found were for a specific diameter, or had a very small range.<br />These fit great, look great, are sturdy and well designed.<br />As a previous review mentioned, if your tubes are closer to 39mm (mine are 37), you may need a slightly longer bolt. Not a big deal at all.
B00TQ0S7QE|1|Not so good at the car wash or with BMW with parking sensor in front of it.
B004A2D6JQ|5|Exact replacement for original OEM wiper blades. Very satisfied.
B001UFRW0A|5|Installed this along with hellwigs front sway bar..huge difference. Got rid of almost all body roll and handles way better. Better cornering traction getting on or off a freeway. I also have a 2/4 drop on my 04 silverado with aftermarket exhaust and it fits perfect. Comes in a gray color but i powder coated mine chevy orange. It fits with spare tire in i just leave mine off. Took around an hour to install with air tools and i had access to a lift :P
B005LW5K5M|5|This fits perfectly! I have bought two now (Race bike problems) Each one was perfect
B00K7938O4|5|Item arrived when expected and as described.
B004SRRELY|5|Easy installation
B0047DB848|5|Perfect fit
B00GYY2MOS|5|Excellent quality , helpful installment manual , I'm glad with my purchase , you won't regret buying any of these products they are reliable and good conversion kits
B000HM579K|5|Outstanding product and highly recommend!
B00GE9Y5IE|5|I installed in less than an hour.  No tire removal.  Awsome fit, and looks great
B00SXAVX2I|4|It works great but the vacuums it pulls is a bit weaker than the vacula
B00JG74H20|5|They are awesome. Screwed right in, hides all the springs and other eyesores. Great product!!!
B004IHCP2C|5|Fast ship, helmet was exactly as described . You can never go wrong with an Arai. Excellent price as well.
B000OZS9Y0|1|Not designed to fit a 2015 Polaris UTV
B0012INQG4|5|Fast delivery. Works great
B00KCQSM9S|5|Fits Chevy Camero seats well.
B004LEHHAM|5|Quality was great! Looks awesome and added a deeper tone to my cummins. Ran it all the way it for a few days and then cut my pipe back to a axle dump and it sounds spectacular. Expensive yes but the looks and sound are worth it. It's good to be different!
B00G620ZVU|4|Nothing bad to say about them. Quick delivery with no hassle. I put 4 our beach truck and so far so good. They have plenty of throw and seem to be constructed well. Not sure how water resistant they are but I'll update my review in a few months. Hopefully they'll last but at $25 a pair it's no biggie... better than paying $50 for one. I would definitely buy them from this seller again. Only reason I gave 4 and not 5 stars is cuz no one ever gets 5. There's always room for improvement. Great product and great service though
B00GTIHCAS|5|Factory correct...installrd in seconds...good stuff
B000PCABPW|5|Great product
B00AZPP0Y6|5|the lights work great
B002YX8CG0|5|Product exactly as described.  Quick delivery.  Good quality.
B002J857H2|1|Useless.  Can't keep the pole on the head.  Waste of money.
B000EAIERW|5|Perfect.
B00BD4ND4W|1|It's a sticker...this should be posted on the title NOT in fine print and screw ppl like they did to me and have to waste money to ship it back to them because they don't send you a prepaid label
B005DMD7A0|4|a little bit smaller than i expected, should have read the specs first
B00JW1X3LG|5|The switch works great just as it should. The only problem was that it was grey color instead of black.i was just happy that I can now move the front window up and down. The price was super , very affordable.
B00W97VF06|5|Worked perfectly
B007ETLKG8|5|This stuff is the sh*t! I used it on diesel that had been sitting for 7 to 10 years used double the dose as recommended for really old fuel.  I not only ran my boat (400 GAL) on it but ran a full tank (40 gal) in my sprinter without one problem! If I ever need it again I will buy in a heart beat!
B00Y3H1VB8|5|Best jacks...very heavy duty. Quality prod7ct.
B00DRE9RBE|5|Expensive but it seems that KTM has a lock on pricing these parts, I'm only able to buy the paper element filter cheaply. It's a good thing the steel screens don't need to be replaced just cleaned out. I used compressed air instead of solvents as to keep the rubber parts from degrading.
B00DUV0W9A|5|Good
B000N9K274|5|This part is 12.5 x 12.5 in. Over all and the mounting holes are 11 in. Center to center.
B00C7Y9US0|1|Mehh
B00L2NF1XA|4|They were perfect....
B0067UJ9I6|4|Haven't had engine (95 F150 351) running yet.
B0073G2N40|5|The lights are awesome
B00GR8OWWQ|5|Nice quality
B00008BKX5|2|Disappointed. Be prepared to purchase 2 additional Anti-Rattle Kit/Devices, if you want the Extend-A-TRUCK 944 to be stabile, without significant rattle, excessive play, in your receiver hitch, as well as the adjustable-T bar. After I assembled the product, and put my 16 ft. canoe on top of my Silverado truck topper with Yakima cargo bars, I was ready to return the item. The Extend-A-Truck 944 was not stable, there was significant rattle, and excessive play. In order to solve the problem,  I purchased two, Curt Anti-Rattle Kits (The pin type) @ $29.99 each, a $60.00 additional expense . One of the devices I used at the receiver hitch, and the other device where the adjustable-T bar attaches to the extender. The Anti-Rattle Devices totally eliminated the significant rattle and excessive play. The Extend-A-Truck 944 is a much better, and significantly improved product, with the use of the anti-rattle devices. They should at the very least, make the consumer aware of the potential need for these devices In conclusion, I want to be perfectly clear, if I was unable to eliminate the significant rattle and the excessive play with the Anti-Rattle Devices, The Extend-A-Truck 944 would have been returned-end of review.
B000E7YYDS|5|Awesome sprayer!
B004Q6V5M6|5|I was very pleased with the product I got. The first set I got, the chrome was peeling a little at the bottom of the stem so I called the owner and he shipped a new pair out the next day, very pleased with the service! Mirrors look great just need to use some thread lock so they don't move.
B003WGPIIS|5|Works great, was easy to install and saved me 357.00$ according to the quote my auto repair gave me.
B00DNX92TQ|4|The tank is awsome but the only problema is that the iPhone 6 with a light case, doe´sn´t fit....
B004SL8568|5|Used it for a fluid exchange for the converter in a 2008 Prius. So far so good. Between draining and filling it took about an hour
B004I0LVGU|3|Slight fitment difference from OEM.
B00KJGPN2K|5|Excellent product, although it has too many functions to remember if used widely.
B00P8BMDKQ|5|Nice looking part, tight fit in the Trans but it stopped the leak. Thanks!
B0092ZQN00|5|I am so happy I made this purchase.  It really works.  So easy to install.
B00B5UTCE4|5|LOOKS GREAT ON MY AMMO BOX
B00UO6BOBE|3|The jacked does move a lot of air which it is designed to do so in that respect, it works. Just don't count on too much protection from the armor. The shoulder and elbow pads don't stay in place so they probably wouldn't  be of much use in case of an accident. The pouches they reside in are made of the same stretchy material as the jacket so there's a lot of play where the armor sits. After a quick spin on the interstate, the shoulder pads were blown back on my back. . I took all of mine out and just use the jacket on very hot days. The jacket fits very well so I don't think it is a size issue, just not very secure in the shoulder and elbow pouches where the armor goes.
B00GGRDTUE|5|The colors are sharp and bright, and the magnet sticks well to my car. Absolutely love it!
B00DNLFKVC|3|These are nice tires, they grip well on a sport SUV (Porsche Cayenne), but tend to prematurely fail.  The previous ones lasted about 30K miles with plenty of tread for at least 10k more but one of the tires' tread ripped off.
B001C6N6JS|5|I never thought it would happen to me, but here I am writing a review about a Control Arm.  What can I say?  This thing has it all!  Made of strong metal.  Has rubber bits in two areas.  It slid into place like an old man sliding into a tub.  And feel?  Forget about it!  This thing will make your Civic ride softer than a pillow stuffed with kittens and baby kisses.  This is D. Tuerk approved!
B002L9DHX0|3|mmmm
B005SB6S3Y|5|Excellent System.  Arrived a head of schedule, complete and worked as expected.
B001THVNCM|5|great product for a quick detailing of your vehicle especially good on dark colored cars this stuff works fast and gives a great shine!
B00BCRMA9Y|5|Love it
B000W0OFXG|5|GREAT I have had them for some time and they work great!
B0019S8BDU|5|Couldn't find them anywhere on this planet for that price. As usual great service, great price, great shipping! Worked perfect on my 01 Excursion. They perform even better than Accel claimed.
B000BZG78I|5|Product arrived late by 3 days after shipping was promissed was unable to get shipping updates but was very satisfied with O2 sensor itself great price can't fault anyone but shipper.
B000IG20RM|5|Works great, gets into all the small spaces and gives you great coverage.
B0044A7NAM|5|This book has everything you will never need to know through these models for a Mercedes-Benz
B000BGK22E|5|Nice for the price
B00BAZCH6O|5|It was a hard choice between red and blue. I like the blue so much that I'll buy the red ones next. No one in my area has them and they turn a lot of heads.
B000FW61SI|4|works good
B000SKV4T8|5|Great
B00829L30C|4|Have had it installed for about 3 weeks.  So far so good.
B00SM8PA2K|1|Did not fit well and did not function in my 2001 XJ center console lid (meaning it the hook did not latch the lid to the center console).  Returned for refund and will continue to deal with a latch-less lid for now.
B004M09N0C|5|Perfect. Just what I wanted.
B00KJ184XA|4|So far so good.  We will have to see how it hold up in the rain and snow.  Water is the death of these things, but like I said so far so good.  By the way it is not 50&#34;, closer to 48&#34;.
B004GZL0Q8|5|turned out really nice.
B0055DQSMG|5|These do a perfect job of serving their purpose as folding footrests.  The install right into a correctly drilled hole, and the female threads in the nuts fit the male threads on the posts perfectly.  The threads are all right-hand, and are the same pitch.<br /><br />Seriously, they are perfectly adequate footrests and do the job well, and the ends are big enough to flip down easily while riding... don't need to fumble around and try to do it by hand like the ones with tiny ends.
B004B61B34|5|Receiver and wiring took less than 1 hour to install.  Went on very well.  No problems at all.  Used needle nose pliers for washers and lock nut to hold into place between hitch and bumper, did not require removal of bumper.  Very happy with product!
B006WPQMWM|5|Clean (literally) and simple design that is SUPER EASY to deal with before and after use. I placed mine on a 5-inch raised (under toilet only) platform to make it easier to get down to and up from as well as leg comfort while using.
B00NQD2C18|5|Easy to install , using the gasket as a template helped. If your using latch on something U want to secure you will need security screws.
B000EQN0SY|4|I received what I paid for. Not sure why the cap for the product wasn't included im the order also. Would be more convient.
B00KTJ1PLU|1|I could not get it to work  I went by the instructions on the internet.
B00JKS2CZO|5|ALL GOOD
B00H87OACC|5|very good well made product, would recommend to persons wanting to replace with OEM like floor mats
B006ZGKZ9E|4|These have worked great so far.  The only problem I have is that they really stink.  I took them out of the plastic for four days and they still stunk.  I let them sit in the hot sun for a couple hours and they still stunk, but not as badly.  I'm sure if I let them bake a little longer in the sun, the smell would have gone away.
B00LEBLI82|5|They work great
B00EE1JMAK|5|Just installed this and so far it is a blast! Worth every dollar.
B002MH1W42|5|A must have if you live in the city and have to park on the street. I hate when people play bumper cars when they try and park behind you.<br /><br />All the other products out there require you to hang something from the inside of your trunk. This hangs from your plate - brilliant.<br /><br />I had small concern about the product and the owner actually called to clarify everything with me. Of course it was user error on my part, but I really appreciated the extra effort of a personal call to help me through it. Great customer support.<br /><br />When people ask about where I bought this, I have no reservations recommending this and the company. Very happy with my purchase and experience with them.
B000IG1SOI|3|they fit and look good
B00RC2CKMU|4|Just like the original part, works perfect and shipping was fast
B000IG3JAE|4|Bought for our FJ Cruiser cus my hubbie puts butts in the door!  ugh  I stuck it to the inside of the door, but it fell off. NOTE though that we live in the high desert so the heat could be the culprit.  I'll try to re-stick it and hope it stays. Good size for car.
B00REJXAZC|5|We received the liner and love it!  My husband even noticed that our family trip this year didn't use as much gas, and we are thinking it's because the liner is on the back of the truck, and not causing as much wind resistance!  He loves it and it's doing a great job for us!
B00QRTQE80|5|Works well and easy to install, however, I haven't had it looks long enough to check the mpg.
B0066COA8Y|5|Nice and warm
B0049DRYHQ|1|I have not found a meaninful usage for this item so far it either too loose too big or too thin.<br />Maybe I will find a proper usage for this item in the future
B00BMTZRWY|5|Great product and value. Works great and has saved me money!
B004R35CAE|5|Fit onto my Nismo Juke AWD with no problems!<br /><br />You will need to modify the hangers a bit (I used hose clamps to bring them tight) the exhaust tip hits a bit. I used some adhesive foam to dull the rattle sound.<br /><br />I hardly notice any difference driving. I also used a Uhaul light box and a Plug and Play unit that I got from Curt (The plug and play didn't work but I used the harness to make it a no cut job)
B000NCOKZQ|1|This does not work with the solar panel I just bought
B0041TOOHQ|5|Arrived quickly and fit perfectly.
B0023VGBJS|4|looks and fits just fine
B00D01V5KA|5|Love it!!!!! It's beautiful!
B00VGL68S0|5|Works great
B000S0N2RU|5|Excellent product,  last hitch I'll ever need
B0006JLW84|5|Works as it should!
B006LJBK6C|5|Perfect match, perfect fit.  Exactly as described.  OEM quality. Works great.  The only cautionary thing I would say is that at the time I ordered, there was a slight lack of clarity on the Amazon listings for these regulators between BMW 7 series that have anti-theft glass, versus the standard &#34;insulated&#34; glass.  This item is for the latter.  It comes with the motor and that is the only way Dorman makes it for this glass.  BTW, realizing I had ordered wrong initially, I called Dorman customer service, and they were excellent.  This project will take you 2 to 3 hours if you are a first timer...but still awfully nice to save the difference of the $850 that my foreign car service shop wanted.
B00DOP3IDO|4|I like the product but shipping took three weeks.
B00063V1VI|3|Decent tools for the price.  If you're an everyday mechanic, pass.  The quality is mediocre.  I only have one vehicle with drum brakes so I only need to use these tools once every few years.  They'll do.
B0053ZJB9S|5|Love it!  Decal covered scratch on my car perfectly.
B00SBZRELY|1|Stopped working after a week. Doesn't come with the can like in the picture. Would not buy!
B00DWVN08I|5|Great
B00IO98UTC|5|Installed easily on my '04 Aveo. Good price for vented drilled discs. Time will tell if the pads last.  Braking feels authoritative so far.
B00DOP3HYO|4|I like the product but shipping three weeks.
B0039BU4OO|5|I'm very happy with the product and it is up my expectations.
B00ZE90Y08|4|Works fine.
B010GE5FK4|5|Well made vibrant colors
B000JZHYKA|5|Exact replacement for my 2007 Ford Expedition EL Limited (5.4L 3v v8) with 6speed transmission 6R75<br /><br />Even thought the service manual says it's a sealed system not requiring service, this is complete BS.<br />At 85,000 miles, my truck had sticky transmission noticeable coming to a full stop after driving. Dealer said it was normal behavior, but it was not a plausible answer.<br />I did a drain and fill while replacing the filter and cleaning out the transmission pan (there is no drain plug) and now the transmission is silky smooth and doesn't stick at any gear or speed.<br />If you are careful when removing the gasket, it's reusable.
B00DMHS1JK|1|Product worked excellent for the first 2 days then began to short out and by  the next day they wouldnt work anymore.
B003FG4SKE|3|Arrived as promised disappointed in the brilliance of the lighting.  Original Halogens seem brighter.
B00QMWQJRS|5|Product shipped quickly and is perfect.
B003ZWG0UY|5|Great parts at great prices
B000221H08|5|Great stuff.
B00KTHZUJU|5|Works like original equipment but at significantly cheaper.
B000AM8BLI|5|Very well.
B00J7RB72M|5|Was what I wanted.  Needed to store and transport several cd's and this served the purpose.
B00124VON0|5|Amazing
B008X9WF08|5|Exactly as described.
B00G4JU4C0|5|Works great
B0032CAZ26|5|Great ride ........over HD OEM Shocks  ~!
B00G5IO1S8|4|Overall, a good fit. However, unlike the pictures posted, the protector is too short for my 2006 G35 car trunk. There is around a 5 inch horizontal gap on both sides when I installed the protector in the center of my bumper.<br /><br />Fellow buyers, do take note.
B007N6YWQM|5|Worked perfectly and a great price.
B000A0EC6I|3|I have not used the hitch yet but so far. I give it a 3 star. September 26, 2015 I will be taking it for a 2000 miles test run. And I will edit and write or continue this review. But I like it very much....later!!
B00K7X8J6W|3|It has a nice feeling to it, however, too large for my 2013 Honda Civic Coupe.
B006W25ZAU|4|Does not have a high quality feel, but it works well.  I took it apart and used blue lock-tight on everything as the mounting bolts loosened up after the short trial ride.
B00KTHQR0Q|4|Works great, good value but their programming instructions were wrong, would of gave 5 star if the were right. Just search google and the right one are out there.
B00SJTXOZM|5|Great product
B0017LZC36|4|Fit perfectly on my 02 Avalanche. Only thing was it didn't come with and adhesive backing like the instructions stated but no big, hold in place just fine and doesn't rattle or make noise
B000COSAEC|4|shocks restored control and factory soft ride
B0046I3I8I|3|ok
B00C0SQ8KG|5|Works like it should. Great price.
B001NAP2FO|4|This is an OK oil filter. It's slightly inferior in quality to the KTM OEM filter, but if you're changing it every 15-20 hours like you're supposed to, it probably doesn't really matter.
B00Y5MUW6G|5|Looks good.  Easy to install.
B00OM3F04W|5|Loved them
B00M3JTHUU|5|Work really well. No issues. No problems.
B00EDFM3B2|5|Great plug and play.  Super brite!
B000RXKR6M|3|The product is not very good quality
B00TS9ZZ0Y|5|Instantly  had an increase of 2 mpg on my 1998 Dodge Grand Caravan, and I have since seen another 1 mpg. increase in gas mileage..
B00K56K1W6|2|I cleaned the edge of the doors and placed the protectors on.  With in a week the ends started to loosen.  Not sure I will keep them on.
B00U1WG83K|5|Good
B0034G2IIY|5|I love the clean look of the shroud. Literally a drop in fan shroud. Stupid easy to install and works like a charm. Highly recommended item from mishimoto.
B00HWI3J38|5|Great addition to my truck.
B00FMV3SHY|5|Works great!!!  Programming handled by dealership!!!
B00P2D41OQ|5|These lights are so brigth the helps when going on reverse, great product.
B00PJZZ466|5|Very happy with new mirrors. Would recommend
B00UNQ1X5C|4|fits good, designed well has a mate finish.
B002G22AKI|5|Replaced the throttle body on a carburetor with intermittent rough idle and an occasional &#34;whistle&#34;sound which was a vacuum leak around the throttle shaft.Runs perfect,great part!
B00NPY02KG|5|GREAT METER FOR THE MONEY
B00MPXMLHU|1|cheap, wouldnt stick to the plastic, made it very difficult to install, never buy again.
B000WEPI4M|5|very handy, I am using it in my 240z, as it has no cup holders. great product!
B007DKY2IG|5|Good
B0042VVKD4|5|Outstanding product.  Installed in our personal vehicles and I will be putting them in my fleet vehicles...
B00BTL8SGM|5|As represented, mission accomplished and saved a few $$
B001GH5ORK|5|The Daystar Hood Latch did exactly what I wanted - eliminated hood flutter in my Jeep.  I put these on right before driving 12 hours on the highway this weekend.  It was a very windy drive and passed lots of semis going the opposite direction.  The hood didn't flutter once.  They were super easy to install too!  Highly recommend to all Wrangler owners!
B00LTDVDE4|5|There are great!
B00BK86OQU|5|Nicer than I expected. .. worked like a charm!
B004GC44AK|2|material is too ridge.
B00JSRKEWU|5|good saller very fast thank you
B00BS102A8|5|Great decal.  The only thing (and this was my fault) was I put it on the left side of the rear window, which meant the &#34;I&#34; was hidden a bit (got lost along the edge,) but it's still visible.  It would have stood out more if I had put it on the right side.  As I said, this was my fault.  Just a heads-up if anyone else buys this decal.  There is nothing wrong with the decal.  It's fine.  Very happy that I bought it.
B00J0D2YD4|5|Fits a 1995 Honda accord V6 perfectly. Installation was super easy using the included lube. Great buy, does what it needs to do. Make sure you know what you are doing when installing these and take your time.
B000CNHG34|4|A great fan, but it may not be the answer to your cooling problem. Follow the steps below if you aren’t sure. If all those are okay and you engine slowly overheats on a summer day, then think about an auxiliary fan.<br /><br />1. Is the thermostat working? Do you even have one?<br />2. Do you have a fan shroud to maximize airflow through the radiator? A full shroud, not a half.<br />3. Is you radiator old and clogged up?<br />4. Is your radiator big enough to cool your engine?
B00029JC6C|1|Fuel pressure all over the place, would not recommend. Waste of $$$$$ through away
B000E2AJ50|1|Beware - this unit must be built for the Jeep Grand Cherokee with the existing hitch cut-out in the bumper.  It did not fit my 04 Grand Cherokee without a previous hitch and had to be returned.  Amazon accepted it no problem!
B00KTIYYUK|4|Works good
B000EGNAWA|5|Arrived in great condition  just waiting to install it thanks Jegs
B00Q34FCPK|5|Is ok
B00IEYDSHQ|4|Fast shipping.  Good price on tire & wheel.
B002UCAERU|5|I used these on replacement window shades on my motorhome.
B00NGZ5SLM|5|Just what I needed
B0041CC3XK|5|Excellent header system!  Sounds great.  Good fit and finish!
B00K5832XO|5|Great product satisfied
B008ACHYFE|5|nice and bright
B00EXHZ2VI|5|Great Price.  Cheaper then the dealer....a lot cheaper...same quality!!
B001IGBIAG|5|Work as advertised
B000EQ0O7E|5|Good pads.
B00VBJR8CM|5|Fit perfect, looks great
B000IEH7IQ|5|Looks awesome in the back of my Ford Ranger! Didn't fit originally but the tabs on the sides are easy to cut with a pair of scissors. Highly recommend to offset your vehicle and protect the interior.
B009AAH1EE|5|Ok
B000GTUVO0|4|A little small but works well and definitely sticks well on the tank if you follow the instructions.
B00REJXJF8|5|Husband loved it! Fits and looks great :)
B0002U2V1Y|5|This clay bar system is perfect! I did half of the hood and the difference was night and day. The key to this system working is washing your car before you clay it.
B00RW2LT9A|5|Love em
B00WJ43LD8|4|Good product for the price. Just too much airflow inside the helmet.
B007Z2Z2CC|5|Perfect fit. Fast shipping.
B000BQY0CM|4|great tool. Hard to assemble. Instructions not clear. I am handy and I had to assume, start over, etc.<br />But when it is done, it is great for riding with the kids.
B00CIVE9HE|5|Perfect Fit... Exactly the right size
B00XTQ7D5M|3|Fit perfectly and works great.
B00936PB60|5|Ordered for my dad who got a new truck with hub cap things he hated. He really likes these. And they stick really well as far as I can tell.
B00BIRNHP4|5|Great
B005OY9I7I|5|It went on very easy I am very pleased with it and I recommend anyone who is a mossy oak  person to order one
B000IG5QOQ|5|Lucas Oil is AMAZING!!!
B0040D2TGG|1|Ordered these to replace missing pins on the engine splash guard of my wife's 2007 Toyota RAV4.  They were a lost less expensive ($0.50 each) compared to the dealership ($2 each).  Unfortunately, these pins popped out after a 200 mile road trip.  After purchasing the dealer factory pins I noticed that these were a slightly smaller.  Live and learn.
B00K1I2WXE|4|Love it! But it runs large and is too big. Unfortunately, I passed the cut off for returns.
B00KTHWXH2|4|good product and replacement
B00G4L23PY|5|great light, came fast, great protective package, brighter than stock, awesome price
B00BYH6C1E|1|Disappointed. Not theproduct I thought it was Difficult fitting between seats of Lincoln. They keep working out. Overpriced. Would not recommend.
B008427D88|5|These little clips did what I needed, by allowing me to snap together the splash guards underneath my 2007 Honda Odyssey.
B00G8R69RC|5|Very nice! Go ahead
B00NH7PI5K|4|I  like them a lot but I had to buy them again because one logo fell off. Than I purchased again AND AGAIN ONE FELL OFF!  BUT STILL I LOVE THEM!
B0002SQUTU|4|Thank u
B0046IC24O|5|Saved me a ton of money.  They are working just fine.
B005DMQC1G|5|Great product. Mounts well and looks great. The prongs in the intake block are unique and work very well. Overall very satisfied with the product.
B004NMF0EC|5|Fits good plenty of adapters to make it work on basically anything, used it on a jeep jk 4wd shifter
B001P2H4U6|5|Excellent.  Fit great.
B007BJBN4U|5|Perfect!
B010XZRQCG|5|They look great and a super bright.  Great for plate lamp bulbs
B00WI0MX0U|3|I toss useful stuff into the console of my car. I've now added this multitool and knife to have in the car if needed. For that use, I like the bright color, since they can be easy to find buried deep in the console. The items aren't top of the line, and aren't cheap. They are a mid-priced offering that should hold up to occasional use. Anyone who uses either tool frequently should consider a sturdier product. Of course, Ford fans will love the logo element of this product.
B007CLM2JM|5|so far so good..
B00192JGDU|5|Camco deluxe grilling table was a gift for dad, he loved it! So i'm happy! prompt delivery!
B000C7ZUF6|1|worked for about 3 weeks then failed
B00ND6JMHA|1|Gauge never worked, powered up but would only display A0, ended up buying an AEM at the local performance shop...
B00DBENBXU|4|Good
B01092IEEM|5|This is a awesome item. This fit perfect for my Chevy malibu 2004.
B00FKIQT20|5|Very nice, and easy to install.
B003WLQNBE|5|Good product
B004EIAADG|5|What I wanted, and needed, was an air compressor for my bicycle tires, as I ride every day, whether I want to or not.  My existing unit was 7 years old and sounded like it was on it's last legs everytime I used it, despite being fully charged.  Searching Amazon for weeks and could not find a suitable battery driven air pump that had good reviews.  Until I came across this unit.  The air compressor is sort of an afterthought, as it was designed for much more than that, but the reviews were excellent, suggesting this is a quality product.  Right out of the box it was precharged to 100 percent, so I read, and reread the operating instructions and hooked it up to the bike tires.  As soon as I did that, the gauge told me what the current pressure was, and when I pressed the on/off rocker switch, the little light in the gauge came on and the air compressor went to work with authority.  This is exactly the unit I needed, and I am very pleased.  The 24 lb weight is not obnoxious, and I can jump start my car if I ever need to, as well as charge up a cellphone with this very useful device.  Very well made, design is excellent, and it is highly recommended.
B004ZF41TW|5|All of my vehicles have this brand HID, I've had very good luck with them! Thanks for the great
B0019C17H8|3|Will this fit on my 2002 Honda Civic si hatchback?
B0048YM8CW|5|best price I found for a quality product even cheaper than the cheap ones
B001ILIQW4|4|excellent
B00BTKTBF0|5|good
B0097JQ32O|5|Bought for my husband who usually used cardboard to get down on his knees to work on motorcycle.  He loved it!  Perfect for those have to get on the ground mechanical issues!  I think I now have to get another one!
B00MAQMZSW|5|Good quality plastic. Worth the $$$$
B00SGGWGRU|5|Sturdier than I thought! Love the colors! I'm still waiting for my license plates to come in to install the frame to my car.
B00EKN8FXC|5|Great light.  About the same as the originals.
B00469J9J4|5|Great product. Gives a nice &#34;like new&#34; sheen that stays where it's put. It's not like other tire dressings that end up coming off the tire and on to your car. Long lasting too. Great stuff I love their products.
B00NAUKQ0Q|4|Good
B00GM4WKJM|1|Ripped after a few weeks. Did not fit well either.
B004HEBN1A|3|They are a decent deal considering the price buy they really need to be packaged better, both of mine were scratched. They are in si many pieces and the metal is so thin that when assembled they sag at the connection points.
B000VKRQDI|5|Thanks
B002YKETS8|5|This funnel is a little pricey at around $23 but it makes the job easier and keeps the motor clean of oil. For me it was worth the cost. The screw in funnel keeps the funnel from falling over (hands free) while pouring in oil. My 2014 Toyota Camry valve cover has very little depth from the top where the funnel is inserted. The rubber gasket keeps any oil from dripping off of the side. It was worth it.
B006WPQNB2|5|Excellent potti, comfort height, tissue holder and electric flush.  We highly recommend this potti, it's well made and high quality.
B0088CNNHY|1|Didn't fit rims - had to return
B00FDW57VC|5|needed it
B00UU1DPRY|5|this is AUsome!  ready to tailgate. War Eagle!
B00VELE71W|5|Great it is better than expected!!!!
B006GFB958|5|Beautiful way to show my bear pride
B007WICTX4|1|Didn't fit
B00E5DQ750|3|It pumps well. I use it to transfer fuel from a 55 gallon drum to a larger gravity tank. I would have rated it much higher if it had a quality hose and longer power cables
B00RBIUOU0|5|looks and works great.
B005FNGF0Q|5|This works fine on my 4 runner Limited 2011. Fast delievery too.
B007P05FBW|5|I wont have to worry about breaking my tailgate strap again.
B00MPE879K|1|This is a big disappointment. I bought Camco 51038 scissors last year which looks almost exactly the same as this one. It works like a charm so I want to buy a second one. For some reasons, Amazon doesn't sell it any more. This one, although the same looking, shows rust (between the joint of those two pieces) in a week. More importantly, the two pieces fall right apart when you use the scissors!
B00GYI1YCK|5|As expected
B000C5C9B6|5|Exactly what I needed that no one had in town!!! Worked exactly like it was designed to! Son's car is up and running!
B005FKR12K|5|buddy bought this for his 2000 tacoma. he installed it wrong but then reached out for support and now it works great. he seems to like it.
B00PMVUJF8|5|These little plastic things did a great job in holding together all the under-panels to my Honda Odyssey.  By ordering this pack, I saved money and I have additional clips for my next auto project.
B00R62UO5G|5|Good job, the best seller
B009IFIAPU|5|Fit perfectly.  Shipped fast.
B00LSYW6QI|5|Bolted it on to the card and it does it's job
B008L0GVS6|5|on time, works great
B008UR7J6I|5|works great
B003YO37ZO|3|My mistake. I should have ordered Anco Contour C-21-OE. The A-21-M is not the correct fit, and lifts at speed.
B00A7EO3SE|5|nice set
B001B7TT1M|5|We bought my husband this for Father's Day and he loves it!  Very sturdy and functional for the amount of tools and supplies he likes to keep in his truck!
B006HYAARG|5|looks bad ass
B00R8MSXDE|5|Just as described.
B000AMLWPK|5|love it
B002R1ZO5G|5|Great headlight, pretty good fit.
B005G5QZ1M|5|A must for the Husqvarna FE 350 S.
B001XUD46S|2|They look good but fit poorly. Mcant close front window all the way without pushing the ventshade out.  Sending it back
B008CE09PM|4|It came in good condition and works well for my intended purpose. I have a Honda Civic on which I carry an aluminum basket off the hitch in back. Because the hitch on the Civic is so low to the ground, the back of the aluminum basket was constantly scraping on the road in even modest dips. By using the upper receiver of this new device, the aluminum basket is now well off the ground. Although it is substantially larger and heavier than I need, it works great and was a good value.
B000CM0WW2|5|Fit prefect !!
B000JFN9WW|5|this works great for evacuating transmission fluids, oil or other light weight fluids.
B0002UEPVI|5|Good stuff.
B006OKXNFE|5|I can't comment on any actual improvements from installing the new filter but it sure sounds like my 5.0 is taking bigger breaths now! I love the throaty growl from under the hood this thing gives. I have noticed an one extra mpg but I added this filter and put in a fresh 8 quarts of royal purple at the same time so its probably a combination of both. Buy it.
B002EOZFQ4|5|Easy to mont and looks good...
B00RKXSHS2|1|They do not fit Chrysler  02-03-07 mini vans at all. Very unhappy
B00BTLEIIY|4|they fit very good
B009EKWIU2|5|Installed myself before a dealer oil change and saved a bunch over dealer cost and labor.
B00PBO0Z3M|5|I purchased this set for less money than one headlight.  Can't beat the price or the quality.
B0000AYFTV|3|Returned.  Need complete wiring kit.
B007H2V43Q|5|Just as described. Reasonable shipping. Will buy again
B007KTINZ8|5|Love all the ice stuff!!
B000YKZAVU|5|Wish I had known about these before. They really work great
B00M8LFXP6|5|They work perfect for me. No metal hook to scratch anything although you do need something to loop the loop end of the strap around. I would buy these again.
B004W97WA6|5|fit perfect. easy to install.
B000BRCKAU|5|Delivered 2 weeks earlier than expected and exactly what we needed.  No damage, no surprises. Perfectly happy.
B001TAJUD8|5|just as good as the oem one for a lot less
B00TQ07IOQ|5|Great deal for the price.
B000GZMSJU|3|Look okay but they are not very resistant to rub and abrasions .
B0002KKHSS|5|Works really well. My upholstery looks brand new.
B00AY21IKA|5|Fit right on Thanks
B00GSAUHB8|3|Overall, I like the idea of this sun shade, but in some ways, the cheap accordion types work better.  I have a black car with black leather seats in the humid south, so I do everything to try to keep the car cooler.<br />PROS: It doesn't take up much space and will adjust to the size of the windshield.  It easily folds up and fits into the included bag or side door pocket.<br />CONS: Only one side is reflective, while the other side is black, so I have to spend time turning the reflective side out.  It also offers no insulation whatsoever unlike the more foamy accordion ones that are reflective on both sides.  And, it doesn't wrap around the rear view mirror as well.  The product photo shows a car with NO REARVIEW MIRROR!
B00FXLJ8U4|5|They look good, but I (fortunately) have not had to use them. And I don't want to slice a seat belt or break a window to test them. If I have an occasion to use them, I'll update this review.
B005E39NS8|4|Works as expected. Instructions are simple and on point took ten seconds to program.
B00S7COAOK|5|Threading is tough and precise. The metal is tough and smooth. The threading does not damage exhaust tube and easy in easy out. It does not lock in and no melting. The picture I provided shows imperfections because I used it already and used a paper towel to wipe it clean.
B00W0SR2JM|5|Very Accurate - Nice Size - Works Great Checking TerraTrike Tire Pressures
B00WFD2Q5W|5|looks very nice
B00PKE6SNY|5|This stuff is great!!
B008P0HYA6|5|It fit perfectly.
B00EDQ2096|5|Perfect replacement for my OEM parts.  No issues and they work great.  Now I don't have to worry about going over bumps and losing control!
B00XAX4B9A|4|Summer can be awesome. Fun in the sun, the pool, trips to exotic locales. But one thing that has always sucked about the summer (or. really, any time in California) is a hot, stifling car with nuclear-hot seats thanks to the sun. Everything gets hot, bleached out, and brittle. Thank heavens for AlphaShades and their car windshield sunshade. No more burned backsides, or scalding steering wheels for me!<br /><br />See, the heat is pretty bad. We all know how ridiculously hot a vehicle's cabin gets in the sun. It's now quite easily 20 degrees cooler now with my AlphaShades Sunshade. That translates into more gas savings, as I don't have to start the truck and then crank the A/C while it idles and make the cabin suitable for humans. It means less wear and tear on the vehicle too. But that's just a fraction of the savings.<br /><br />See, UV light destroys almost everything, eventually. Intense all day exposure makes cloth seats bleach out and prone to tears, drys and cracks natural leather, and will cause vinyl to almost fall apart. Not to mention what it does to steering wheels (Hot! Hot! Hot!), gear shift knobs, door panels...You get the idea. With AlphaShades you're golden. And I'm not talking about the color your palms turn having to make a left out of the parking lot without a sunshade.<br /><br />&#34;But I don't have the room in my car for this huge shade!&#34; says you. &#34;But it folds down to 1/10 it's size with a couple of twists!&#34; says I. It even comes with a little sleeve to keep it safely tucked away behind the seat, under the seat, or on the floor, and an elastic strap so it doesn't pop open mid-drive and wreak havoc. The best part? it's 100% satisfaction guaranteed. I'll quote their Amazon listing here, because I couldn't say it better: &#34;No Questions Asked, 100% Money Back, Lifetime Guarantee&#34;. Boom. No worries about it falling apart, tearing, or popping a seam. You're covered. Literally and figuratively. One issue I do have is that this shade is nearly twice as expensive as competitors on Amazon, and they're all made of the same nylon/polyester material, and of similar (if not the same) size, 59&#34; x 31&#34;(approx.). So I'll let my readers decide if the &#34;Lifetime Guarantee&#34; is worth the extra coin.<br /><br />I received the above product(s) free of charge from AlphaShades.

B000221M94|5|A well made product to protect doors in tight garages.
B007VSYNXY|5|Easy to install, looks great, and the exhaust is slightly louder (was not expecting that).
B00O29JM5O|5|Good quality
B004PILLZG|3|Go to Lowes and buy &#34;Peel & Seal&#34; in the roofing isle. It is a third of the cost, but comes in 6 inch by 25 feet rolls. Don’t get me wrong. There is nothing wrong with this product, but it is overpriced compared to Peel & Seal. I used Thermo-Tec for the firewall and toe-boards of my 1954 Crestline Victoria, then used Peel & Seal for under the front seats and back. Also get a roll of aluminum tape while at Lowes. You want to seal the gaps where all the material meets.
B003O387TQ|4|Nice sticker but not as big as I expected it to be.
B009DJU70C|5|After installing works smoothly for a fraction of a price compare to o.e. so far i am very happy. i will buy this product again
B0002SR4Q8|5|Had a shop put my filter on too tight. This popped it right off. Perfect.
B00OWQPV4I|3|the helmet is cool, and the quality seems good, but it looks way too big on my head. I sent it back.
B00GTXS8OC|4|Good
B006CFCZ78|5|great choice, I could not be happier the system was a bolt on application as detailed in the ads, it fit perfectly and looks great as it sounds.
B004ZF4MW8|5|VERY Bright
B00HKSM1A2|5|Exact one used on my 2015 Versa. Also works with my 2016 2.5 Altima. This is what the factory used on both cars.
B00NO51854|5|I love and it shows that it is a first material
B001GENZCE|5|Great gear set at half the price of the dana-spicer set.
B002R0R554|5|Perfect fit (2001 RAV4) and even came with an lightbulb installed
B000C5HK88|5|Perfect, exactly what i needed to pass state inspection
B00K63OJO4|4|The small tab that you have to push in had to be shaved down a little.  it didn't lock into place right out of the box.  I pulled the old key out of the factory one and reinstalled it in this new one so I didn't have to have the key cut.  Worked like a charm.
B004X5QKD4|5|Great fit, easy installation.
B00EC0YFBO|5|good buy for the money thanks
B00008RW9V|5|Works as advertised.
B005MVB2WM|5|Like a glove
B009YMJWEA|5|Works better than the harleys
B00XCLLHCY|5|Door panel removal tool that works!  Nice stainless steel with ergonomic square shaped handle. I don't have to worry about rust or it breaking. Makes removing the door panel easy and without damage. Has a precise fixed tip to help with removal. Black ball provides leverage and protects from scratches. Quickly loosens door panel fasteners. Nice quality.<br /><br />Product was supplied as a sample for my unbiased review.
B008G22G1A|5|A+++++ fast delivery
B0088WCEP6|5|Exellent
B00SSBL9JE|5|Awesome
B009ZZAJHK|5|Great gift for my son in-law!
B00P2K08J6|5|Works and it looks great. Only gripe would be I wish the black sheath on the cord covered the full length of the cord
B00A4542H8|5|A very good wax.  One waxing lasts six months.  Application is easy. I've heard that their liquid ICE wax is just as good and easier to apply.  I'm doubtful that a liquid wax is as good as a paste wax. The price is right and I received free Prime two day shipping.
B00BXLE7M2|5|Very heavy duty
B002DOME1E|3|Too short
B003RWO14E|5|very good
B004A32A10|5|easy to install arived in good shape
B00J0DVBAQ|5|All pieces fit nicely and installation was ver easy with a nice finished look. I'd buy this product again.
B010GPIZ4G|5|Excellent!!!
B00HE1BQWY|1|A piece of crap.  Don't buy it.  It did not work.  I wrote about this before, looking for feedback from the merchant or Amazon but got nothing.  I am disappointed that Amazon didn't follow up.  I wasted good money on this thing.  The keyfob isn't even the same as the original and when I tried to put the original circuit board into it, the buttons were off just enough so that it doesn't work.
B00F5MCL1E|5|really foams up the soap for a great wash!!!!!!
B000COS0KQ|5|nice
B0018EUDHW|5|I've had three BMW 328xi's in a row. I love the free BMW service, but it doesn't cover their $500 run-flat tires.  Got a nail, but no one would touch it -- they all said, &#34;You can't repair run-flat tires.&#34;  But I said, &#34;Phooey, what's it going to hurt&#34; -- so I just pulled the nail out and plugged that RFT on the wheel from the outside (like I've been doing with nails & screws in my tires for over 40 years).  Well that was 5 years ago, and I've done plenty of them since then -- and I've never had one fail yet . . .
B00H7MUW8E|1|very poor product
B00O67P1TS|4|They are nice and look great in my car. Only issue is they don't fit perfectly and not that easy to fit properly
B000B6H1T6|5|these look amazing and make my car stand out i love them
B009XINN9K|5|fast shipping very pleased !!!!!
B00R3O0Y0M|4|The horns were not as loud as I thought they would be, however they were still superior to my factory horn. If you want a new horn with a more full sound and don't have much space under the hood, these are a great option to go with. The horns also didn't come with step by step directions and the diagrams weren't labeled very well, so that's why I said four stars. I would also recommend these horns over the Supertone, because the Supertone sounds more like a European car.
B00A1XDT40|5|Thanks
B0002KKHSS|3|I used this on my boat upholstery and did not like the way in cleaned in that it had to be re cleaned with another product to prevent dirty residue from sticking to the newly cleaned upholstery.
B000C15CRS|5|So far so good. It has only been installed on the engine for about 100 miles. This part is like for like compared to the original Ford  part installed in my 1988 Town Car. Of course this one is made in China but so are most of the parts for a car of my vintage. But on the bright side of things, at least new parts are available at a very reasonable price. I used a fine point white paint stick to trace over the timing marks and the timing numbers to enable to set the timing with a timing light. If you don't trace the timing marks it will be almost impossible to see the timing marks with a timing light. Be very careful installing this part. Start the installation process it with a balancer installation tool, then finish the installation with the bolt that holds the balancer on the crankshaft. This way you will not push the balancer in too far. It will only go in as far as the attachment bolt allows. If you push this blancer in too far you will push the timing gear on the crank shaft into an indentation in the block and the timing chain will snap. Luckily the stock 302 V8 is low compression with low valve lift, hence a non interference engine. I was advised to put a small amount of RTV silicone Permatex ultra black on the Woodruff key since it is part of the front oil seal. This balancer slides over the end  of the crank shaft easier than I thought it would. Even Summit racing sells Dorman parts and their technical support center representatives speak highly of Dorman parts.
B000MU8XHK|4|Seems really light weight compared to my more expensive cables. But will see if it works. Easy to handle, red end covers may not stay on long.
B00PC0G07A|5|Absolutely love this product. 1.5 hours of labor but we'll worth it. Looks and feels great on my 04 bmw 3 series. I'll come back and rerate it on its durability. So far so good though.
B005JUX1S4|4|Great pump and plenty of hardware to spare (depending on how it's connected)...directions could have  been better though
B0002JN2EU|5|I use this in my car (engine runs smooth) and also put some in my Snowblower gas tank to fix a surging engine problem and to keep the gas stabilized over the summer.  This stuff works GREAT!
B0045E3MHK|4|it is what I expected but I really need a box that gives me the channel with the signal level
B00BVPOC20|1|No it didn't fit. Returned it.
B00T57HZV6|5|My daughter loved it
B008VQ0RSU|5|easy to install
B0043E39I4|4|Ordered for my husband.  Whatever it's supposed to do, it did the job.  No complaints.
B00QH40J0Y|5|I took rear bumper off to install this made job lot easier and its only a few plastic clips in the rear wheel well and 2 big hex bolts in the bumper up top. you need to squeeze a big allen key in there and finnigle  the bolt out and whole rear comes off. gives you access to the whole rear of car for easy installation. my pops had problems, hope this helps.
B00HVKPWP0|5|Worked great!! Would buy again if I need another one.
B00V4049K2|5|Excellent product idea.  Noticed a difference within two days.  And very convenient and not in plain sight.  Although its looks would be ok for up front in the car.  Will probably order the smaller one too for the small area by my cat litter box.  Awesome product!!
B000EQRH5G|5|I replaced the crappy malfunctioning Napa thermostat with this OE Delco part.  You can tell from looking at the two that the Delco part is superior in overall construction quality.  With the Napa stat', I would get unreliable performance and often would overheat when climbing mountain roads.  With the ACDelco, I have yet to have a problem.
B00TQZUKRI|1|Wanted metal not flimsy plastic
B002NBQNDC|4|as expected, and was shipped good. have yet to install.
B00DV2EP50|3|seems ok but louder then the oe starter
B00VVK4WWU|2|Didn't stick to the mirrors.  Fell off after one week.
B000R8F47Y|4|I've owned this cargo net for about a year and a half now. I mainly use it on family camping trips, and it works pretty well for that purpose. I have occasionally worried I was going to break one of the hooks, but so far they're all holding up. My only complaints are that the spacing of the netting is a little bigger than I would like, and tangling is inevitable unless you remove the hooks. Overall, it's well made and comes in handy a few times a year, so I can definitely recommend it. BTW, my truck is a 2014 Ram crew cab and the size is great.
B009AM2L0G|5|Great product, great price on time delivery.. Thanks
B003KK5OE4|3|I can hear and talk while driving, but the sound quality of the speakers is &#34;tinny&#34; and lacking bass. When i activate voice command the system gets extremely quiet and i can't hear the prompts, a problem i didn't have with bt headphones. The control system leaves me wanting as i miss the luxury of having play buttons on my headset/headphones, also missing a stand alone button for activating voice command. Instead i have to hold the main button for which if i hold too long, shuts off the power and too short does nothing but beep and mute sounds for a few seconds, with a distinct lack of a notification of correct press time for voice command. The range also isn't great being that it cuts severely when i keep my very large  phone (note 3 in a case) in my standard right cargo pocket and now have to switch to my left which is decent but less comfortable than grabbing with my right. All in all still pretty decent, may make some mods. Helmet looks cool
B00C4B18JU|5|Fits good and works good
B0031HRJ80|5|Torally satisfied, great price, car running good again
B00RM327NG|5|This really did the trick for me.  I have a Kyocera Hydro phone (it's an average size phone) and wanted a cheap and unintrusive mount.  The magnets are really strong and it sits in my vent without falling (Audi A4).  To remove my phone, I do have to hold the vent attachment in place while removing the phone or the base will come off of the vent.  Just using the magnetic sticker was sufficient for my phone. I found it a much simpler solution than a window or dashboard mount...I haven't been able to get any of those to stay on.  It's 3 weeks in on this mount and so far, so good.
B004NLU1V0|4|Pros: Look fantastic.<br />Cons: Extremely fragile.
B001892T3I|5|Nice seat for the money
B00ZR4324K|5|This product was fairly cheap but man do they feel sturdy! They're easy to install and they got here extremely quick! Will most likely buy from again
B003PJE4B4|5|Installed without a glitch...this here hitch,--and received my rack mount like an NFL pro. Used it twice so far. If the manufacturer of this hitch would be interested,--I would be willing to share a design of mine for an optional($)accessory that stabilizes the connection between their hitch(s) and various aftermarket 11/4 or 2 inch mounts(cycles). I researched a lot of hitches, and, this one had more thumbs up than several others. We put it on our 2006 Subaru Forester 2.5 Turbo. I highly recommend it!
B008SEBQ2G|4|Definitely small, maybe a little too small since I can't pick up the one local HD channel with it.  But, I get all of my regular FM favorites, so I gave it a 4.
B00OAJO6E8|5|Work as intended.
B00PT18QAQ|5|This is a sturdy product, well made. The rubber surround gives it protection. The bleeder valve is useful to reduce the pressure to the desired level. The fact that it claims to be calibrated (as far as I can tell mine is indeed accurate) puts it way ahead of all those pencil-shaped gages that vary all over the place in accuracy.<br />The manufacturer seems to be keen to make sure his product is well received and appreciates feedback from his customers.
B006OQ35GU|5|nice to see when the flow is finished
B000A0EJFM|5|I purchased the Fram CA9689 air filter for my 2004 Mercedes-Benz SLK320.  The engine requires two air filters, and that's what was in the package. Since the Chrysler Crossfire uses the same 320 engine, this size filter probably works on at least some Chrysler Crossfires as well.  However, if you have a Mercedes Benz SLK Kompressor 230 (which is the supercharged 4-cylinder engine), this apparently is not the air filter for you.<br /><br />Although two filters are provided in the package, installation instructions are not.  I suggest watching a YouTube video if you are unfamilar with the process for a Mercedes SLK320.  Also, if you're new to doing this, in addition to ordering the CA9689, you'll also need a torx-head screwdriver with the proper size head on it.  You can pick up an 8-in-1 torx screwdriver set at your local big box hardware store for about $6 or a bit set for your drill for about $8 from Amazon.<br /><br />Removal and replaceement is easily accomplished and takes 15 to 30 minutes depending upon your skills.  Removing the plastic cowling over the engine consists of pulling back the two front hoses, then lifting the cowl off, from the front first.  The air filters will actually go into the cowling.  Turning the cover over, you'll see two rectangles on each side, secured with 4 torx screws,  Simply remove the screws enough to pull the filter cover off (the screws shouldn't come off all the way), and remove the cover.  Then remove the old filter beneath and install a new filter in the same orientation as the old filter, making sure the rubber edge of the new filter is tightly in place.  Then put the filter cover in place and screw down.  Repeat for the other side.  Then re-install the engine cover with the new filters by reversing the removal process: place the cover over the rear of the engine first and make sure the vent hole in back is secure over the corresponding hole in the engine before pushing it down in front and reconnecting the two hoses.  You can check whether the cover is properly in place by lifting on the back; if it's loose, it's not installed properly.<br /><br />The Fram filter is an affordable, easy to install air filter for the Mercedes-Benz SLK320 or any other car using the same 320 engine.  It fits well and should work as well as the OEM filter.  Installing the filter yourself will save you a great deal of money, not only from the price of the air filter but more importantly, from the labor cost.  Its one of the most basic tasks a car owner should know how to do.
B002E3644W|5|Fits perfect, only wish it came with shock bolts
B00LNJI1KI|4|Not as bright as I expected but for the price it's pretty good. I used my own brackets so I don't know if the supplied ones are any good.  There was not the first instruction sheet or any info in the box just in case I needed to have any tech help or needed to talk to manufacture for anything. Other than that it's worth buying again.
B000FW2MWW|5|To some extent, what you see is what you get here - it's a 25 foot extension cable for the battery tender quick disconnect harnesses.  It does exactly as you'd expect - connects securely to the harness on one side and to the battery tender on the other.  That said, this was a great addition to my battery tender as we tend to keep our third car pretty far from outlets and this prevented me from having to switch cars around every time I needed to charge it (if it would have even moved at all!)
B00N5423IK|4|Pros: Look fantastic when lit.<br />Cons: Rain water fills lenses.
B007HUIOZO|5|I LOVE this!! It looks amazing and I've gotten so many compliments on it
B006LW94RG|5|Works great, Polaris 500 Ranger EFI
B00789Y98K|5|wks. great and last a long time,I just hose car off and wipe it down with my micro fiber towel and it comes back like I just waxed the car.
B00GG9FB8U|5|I use this product exclusively on my car, you really don't need a lot to get a ton of suds. The formula smells good and it cleans the car very well, and brings out the shine. I've had the bottle for several months now, and still haven't run out, so I would say it lasts a good amount of time.
B001DRLC38|5|Good part.
B00YRHWZ5K|5|I really like this.but I always unplug when I turn the car off.
B001DH810U|5|Perfect fit excellent match
B000OC3Q2I|1|Sent me a unit that looks old and partially used without a key!
B0040ZPQLY|4|zippers are the second worst thing on Jeeps since torx bolts. I would welcome any means to alleviate this process.<br />Pros:<br />-no dust accumulation.<br /><br /> Cons:<br />-should have been a spray instead, but brush helps a bit.<br />-small bottle.
B00FUNPBA6|5|As advertised
B00PQWN5DQ|5|“I just had a chance to check it out, and I must say I’m very Happy with it.  I like that it is<br />small, has a reset button and is very accurate.  The car sensors agree with it, and also with my old Gauge.  I got this Deluxe Tire Pressure Gauge because my old one is sometimes difficult to use depending on the valve location, the new one takes care of that problem.”
B006P86TDI|2|The patch was received quickly and looks great. However, when I went to iron it on my son's jacket, along with another patch, I found that 3 of the 4 corners did not have adhesive to the edge. I tried more than five times to iron on the patch, but the corners remained loose. I finally used Liquid Stitch to attach the patch securely. Not sure if this was just a defective patch, but I would not order from this vendor again because of the aggravation, especially because the other patch worked so well in comparison.
B000TPZHZO|4|It was what I expected
B00J0K1WG2|5|Thank you Sincerely z.k
B001FZL9ZO|5|Very nice
B002MY6ZZG|5|Husband is very happy with this......thank you
B0022XW49S|5|Easy to install,work as described
B00CJLM6GY|5|Best wipers I ever used!
B00P4XSMC6|4|These are just little poorly cut pieces of clay like ceramic. They work but you have to use a rotary tool to grind them to fit. Get the rubber ones that are black and white-ish. Four stars because they work and do the job, but so would an old exaust hose.
B00D6N1PFC|5|Item arrived by the earliest estimated delivery date. I looked at several 5th wheel hitches before deciding on this one. The instructions are vague on some steps, but was not too bad to assemble. B&W has great customer service, I noticed that the hitch rotated roughly 1/4'' in my truck bed after the first tow. I called them and then sent them some pictures they requested. He told me to loosen the torque on the goose neck pin, re adjust, and re torque. The hitches hasn't moved on the second tow.<br /><br />The hitch is made of great quality, and the extra 12'' that it gives you allows for a decent gap when sharp maneuvering is required. both the slider latch, and the king pin release latch move very easy. The 5th wheel was a breeze to connect and disconnect with this hitch. You will still need to be careful when you are backing into a uphill space when the truck is still level, as it could still contact the cab. On a level surface with the hitch extended to the rear position, with a 2008 RAM 2500 Mega cab, and a 28' Keystone Cougar, the closest the trailer got the cab was approximately 4-5''.
B00JMCCGF4|5|If you own a Ram Truck this is the oil you want.
B001OBKJI2|5|great
B006N95USY|5|perfect
B005NLQAHS|5|Good device for price.
B004W5UGVC|4|Came in early and where clearly marked as to right and left on the box, So much I'm very happy with them.
B000C40S9C|5|any problem
B000GZPQ8A|5|Absolutely the best deal going.  Way cheaper on Amazon, than anywhere else. It was a  first run real part from Jaybrake, truly awesome..
B001GO76AG|5|everything went great
B00G9EMCQG|5|VERY ELEGANT ON THE VEHICLE
B0087NB088|5|Worked like a charm once I got the pairing correct.  I use this with my Zumo 550 and my iPhone 4s.  I can even voice dial with Siri!  I pair both the SMH10 and the iPhone with the GPS.  Battery life is good.  Everything worked as advertised.
B00CJ5DZE2|3|Get the aluminum cap. The plastic cap sucks air.
B0043SCBD4|3|Great lock to protect your tailgate. I bought this one because it looked the nicest. A little pricey versus the others out there that do the same, protect your tailgate, but I've had mine stolen in the past, so it's worth it.
B007ZGBLNW|5|Definitely LEDs are better!
B00TYXMP3Y|5|Installed on a 1974 CB750 with a tkat fork brace.<br />The dust seals fit perfectly on the fork tubes; just barely making contact with the tube without binding.<br />The bottom was a little stretch to get on the shoulder of the fork brace, but the dust seals are pliable and stretched easily.
B00UILP2PE|1|Hahaha,  couldn't wait for this review!  I was deeply disappointed with product...Not Carbon fiber for one as ad says,  came damaged and scratched/scrapped when the poorly made plastic was screen printed on. Complete garage and that's where it went...
B008XB1ZWU|5|perfect
B00KJAQFB4|5|Fit perfect same color
B00EKTJU26|5|It looks great on my Chrysler 300. Highly recommended
B00NIUXTFW|5|Very good match.  Well worth the money.
B005WXNGC4|5|nice
B00UL3DYNQ|5|perfect, fit with ease work great. perfect for my 2002 explorer
B0022ZGM76|5|Just what you need when you take apart your wing and lose the rivets.
B0002STSUI|5|Within an hour after receiving my 3/8 inch set, I got on the computer and ordered a set for my 1/4 inch drive sockets !  These are the best socket holders I have seen, and used. I read some of the comments before purchasing them, and some comments say the magnets are weak, and do not hold the sockets in place. This is NOT the case, after putting the first socket into place (smallest to biggest) I noticed how strong the magnets are. I made a game of it for the remaining sockets, I would put the sockets in place from the end of the rack, gently push it towards the center ( where the magnet is ) and see how far the sockets would get before the magnet would kick in, and &#34;suck &#34; them into place. The standard, or swallow sockets got pulled in about 1/2 inch away from the magnet, while the deeps got 1/4 inch. Once all the sockets were in place, I stood it up vertically, shook it slightly, NONE fell, I even put it upside down, again, NONE fell out. Who ever put the post about the magnets not being strong must be using aluminum sockets !!!!!  These racks are great, I ordered one red, one black (one for standard, one for metric) in 3/8 inch I just ordered another set for my 1/4 inch drive set.
B009XS1ZY0|5|product is Ok
B00JR4D7AA|5|Sticks very well,
B00DWKXYHG|5|opt7 is the way to go, without a doubt I'll be buying a set for my or vehicle. The brightness is by far greater than any other bulb I've ever bought
B005DL3DHS|5|Works great second time use truck feels and runs awesome recommend anyone  with a 6.0 to try
B00CEXK7ZY|5|Very easy to install. As a 23 year old female that doesn't know much about cars I has no issues with installation. They fit my 2015 jeep compass latitude perfectly. I left my vehicle sit in the sun to kind of bake them on after installation. I've had no issues with rain leaking in and have taken the beating from a 4 year old without cracking or pulling off. Would definitely recommend these. Worth the money!
B00ASBRINI|5|Great stickers!
B00DJ5KEF4|5|Works great
B000COC0GQ|5|It fits as it should.
B0018ALWOE|5|GlowShift Universal Single Gauge Metal Pod: Needed something to mount Intellitronix LED fuel level gauge. The GlowShift pod works great for 2 1/8” gauge. The pod is all metal construction “not cheap flimsy metal” and comes with mounting hardware also metal.
B00W31VMYC|5|Once the unit is connected and synced with your vehicle, several easy to follow screens pop up. I was surprised at the information available.<br /><br />Hooked right up to my vehicle and showed the fault codes as well as an impressive amount of other information.<br /><br />I found that the torque app worked with this and it had no problem finding the device over Bluetooth on the first try. Not being mechanical at all, this tool was able to provide me with enough information so that I knew what the codes meant and what to ask at the shop. It was nice to &quot;understand&quot; what the mechanic was talking about and to be able to ask enough questions to feel comfortable authorizing necessary repairs.<br /><br />This is a nifty tool to have around. Plug it in anytime and keep up with the status of your vehicle systems.<br /><br />Promotional or discounted product provided for review.
B00DSD68BQ|5|STICK IT TO YOU CAR, LAPTOP, PETS, TABLETOPS, EXPENSIVE ANTIQUE FURNITURE OF YOUR PARENTS, T.V. SCREENS, SLEEPING PEOPLE, LOCKERS, BOOBS AND MORE!!!! I FOUND THAT I COULD STICK IT ON ANYTHING!
B00DE5KLJS|5|was on my porch in 48 hours, 5 star ! found it in 10 minuts on amazon .<br />could not beat the price saved almost $ 150.00 .<br />CAUTION thar was 1 thing differnt than the orignial starter  this new one workes .<br />THANK YOU
B0012BL8LG|5|Performed very well and more than adequate power.
B00KTIYXLU|5|Works perfectly on 2003 Ford Taurus.  Simple to follow instructions and took less than 30 seconds to program.
B00W772TZS|1|Once added to the gas line the gas pours out of the seems of this. You might as well just let the gas dump on the ground. This is useless
B008CPUGMW|5|Got my aftermarket pioneer speakers hooked up to my F150 in a matter of minutes. Must buy.
B003YI421I|5|Best product ever for its purpose. Only wish it had extra clear resin glue available without the powders.
B002ZTNVDW|5|It's toddler proof. No more worries about the spills and drops in the back seat.
B00T2GT9L4|5|I freakin' LOVE this thing. I've had to jump start a car that sits idle for too long (and we're too lazy to turn it over once in a while) and this thing works well and is super easy. I've used it once or twice to charge my phone/iPad and it works as expected. Honestly, if you ever fear that your car battery is going to cause you heartache - THIS is the product for you.
B00FOKOKGG|5|Looks like a new couch...!  The color matches perfectly and hid all the cat scratches. No color bleed on your clothes either.
B006WRVOS2|5|Thank you
B00E9E95UO|1|didn't last a week grabbed floorboard to move it down cut finger on peeling chrome, checked other cover was the same going into garbage bin.
B00A6RL3MG|5|worked perfectly
B00WFHXAW6|1|No good
B00KTIVL10|1|One remote stopped working within a week. Not happy at all.
B009DJXCM2|5|Perfect fit quick and easy come with lower grill clips so you don't have to bother with old ones off other grill. I installed my Ford emblem off old grill and had it installed in ten minutes. Looks great.
B006B7YLX8|5|Awesome. Received as promised and in great condition. I was able to install in about 30 minutes with basic tools. You can't tell that it is even on the truck until full throttle and then the motor sounds like a beast. Not really sure about added horsepower but the sound alone was worth the price tag.
B00IX0CNHM|5|I had to deliver some bricks about 2000 ibs worth in the bed of my truck and this leveled my truck and the ride was surprisingly very comfortable I would buy for another truck if I had one
B00TPKNREM|5|Worked very well.  Would order again
B00BLX1L4O|5|Very pleased with how this looks - much better than the flying H. I have a 2012 Genesis Sedan and it fit perfectly. Make sure to clean the area with alcohol prior to sticking it on to ensure a good fit.Gently press around the circumference and voila! Next up center caps to finish the rebranding.
B000GKD5NI|2|won't stay up
B00AZMBF3O|3|Very soft ride but good if you like it soft.
B00AETR5W8|4|I love my hat
B0049WNCHS|5|beast in the market fit right in my dodge sprinter van 3500
B001O7PNNM|5|Used to remove swirls and small scratches and it works.  Hard process , lots of elbow grease.  Used this, then polish and the wax, all meguirars.  Great products and with the free shipping with prime it's a great deal!
B004S7NX5U|5|If you have a Subaru that has those &#34;cup&#34; type flaps you know what a pain they can be.  I live in Wisconsin, during the winters the &#34;Cup&#34; type flaps would hold snow and slush so badly that my wheel wells would get full of winter material and freeze in the wheel well.<br /><br />Rally Armor flaps installed easy and took care of the problem.  Last winter I had no issues at all with material building up in the wheel wells.
B00JJY3IFC|5|Perfect. Fast delivery.
B00A59IKJ4|4|Had some difficulty seating the rubber cap on the ball joint.  I had to hammer it on with an adapter for a ball joint remover.  Otherwise top quality ball joint.
B002NAQJ8M|5|Packaging was fantastic, so well protected. Perfect for my car, made it look new again!
B00K275XY4|5|I bought this hitch and roller because it had the dual jaws instead of the slide bar. I waited until I actually towed with it to leave this review.<br />I have to say that it lives up to the hype. Hitchup is easy with the handle that moves into place and the visual indicator and unhitching was just as easy. It's quiet and doesn't have much chucking at all. Even after towing for 4 hours the slider worked flawlessly and the hitch unlocked effortlessly.<br /><br />The roller is easy to operate. I slide it both ways with the 5er on it. I was on level ground (as you should be) and it wasn't a problem to disengage the dogs to prepare to slide. It slid easily into position. I think it may be a bit tedious if you ever had to slide it while on unlevel ground. You'll have to play with getting the truck in the right position to relieve pressure on the slide dogs so you can disengage them.<br /><br />The hitch and roller come in two separate boxes even though the shipping directions don't indicate that. And they are heavy!<br /><br />Unfortunately Amazon doesn't accept package feedback even though the product is sold by them. It would be packed well if it wasn't such heavy items. The shippers tend to flip and roll the boxes around instead of actually picking them up and moving them, so they become very beat up by the time they get delivered. I was lucky in that even though the packaging looked like it went though a war zone, the contents weren't scratched. One of the plastic parts bags were torn open but the only bolt that came out was still in the box. So I had all the parts.
B001CAW2DK|4|Outstanding product, fast Amazon service.
B005FL5W5M|5|Fits my 2001 Toyota Tundra.
B0033QO022|4|So far so good. Googled changing coolant in a 2008 Prius. The video showed the steps and I was able to do it with no trouble. Will revisit this review after this product has been in the car for a while.
B00GWFPP8O|5|Fit perfect. easy to clean out.
B004BTAJ2A|5|Very pleased. Quality item. Fast shipping. Thanks!
B002MEHFVO|1|This did not fit my 2007 GMC 2500
B000C5UFVM|5|Works great! Saved hundreds of dollars over Honda OEM
B0087PADUC|4|product as advertised, fast delivery
B008O17D48|5|I love the fact is help when my daughter is driving people actually think! And acknowledge this.....
B0031HEIDY|1|These are high beam bulbs.
B0012RJZT2|5|Wrong connector, not their fault...mine
B000FQ07RU|1|These are dangerous poor quality.<br />The bushing fit is so poor i had to be spot welded to keep it from falling out. They could not even bend the ring around the bushing to support the case from wobbling. I read the reviews and ordered the Dorman 722-024 from Amazon and they are twice the price but include bolts and a replacement spring bushing. They are truly as close to oem as possible. The omix metal is only .125 inches thick 1/8&#34; while the dorman is .180 inches thick almost 3/16&#34;. The ring is formed correctly and the bushing is pressed in not tack welded. Spend the additional money it is well worth the difference.
B000HUILKY|2|Says it fit my car.  It appears to have nothing to do with my car.  Be careful.
B0024E6ZRW|5|I have one already, the second one helps make the step a lot sturdier.
B00CEZJD1Q|5|this is a well-made quality product. Makes an excellent gift.
B002UCYRZU|5|works great
B0042H6BA0|5|traveled over 1000 miles which included going through a torrential downpour and not one drop of water inside. completely amazed by the amount of space inside the bag.
B00T5G53ZM|5|Worked great
B00F7GZQCY|5|Nice decal that can be re applied.
B004M95XMU|5|Exact fit for my RV drain.
B00NOL6RSG|5|I have been using it for a while now and it works just fine. No issues at all. The lights are very bright and they all function perfectly. The patterns are also good and the lights are visible from quite far. So I think I have bought a great product and I would also recommend it to others.
B00KNAJ81E|1|Straps seem too rugged, the heat treated ends too tough to drill out. Installing them in our fleet of pinzgauers holes need to be 5/8&#34;. BEARD Seats. Com has them at a fraction of the cost, and can be drilled out to meet your application if need be.
B00I3I65LE|3|easy to install
B0045WBVUM|4|Great product for the long ride. You really need to let most of the air out of it like the directions say.
B00HKU83BG|3|Great packaging/ fast delivery but once installed one ghost light was dim and I had to buy another set to replace this one
B000E356F2|5|All bolt holes line up perfectly. It is a good solid piece of equipment.
B000C7QHNU|5|Item arrived on time, as described by seller, excellent price, quality product.
B00AOO8B26|5|Awesome product, easy to install. Both sides done in under an hour. The torklift T2301 was purchased and installed on a 2004 Tundra with 4 full doors.
B004PX8BC2|3|If you're looking for a jack to replace that one you had with your spare tire, but you broke when trying to put on the spare and had to call a tow truck, anyway, this might not be the jack for you. It is a bit bigger and probably won't fit into the laughably small space you have under the spare tire in your car.
B006N9H7Q2|5|They are installed and doing there job
B00KMYYQ36|1|I really REALLY wanted this product to work on my brand new (not old and needed to be re-waterproofed or re-treated) patio cushions.  Contacted the company before-hand and asked all the questions about amount needed to do all four cushion sets and drying time for the time of year etc.  Got the spray in.  Followed the directions to the letter... even letting them dry extra time for a full 24 hours and then placed them on the new furniture.  Didn't get a lot of rain or moisture to test them out much and even the few times it did rain I brought them inside to make sure they were protected.  Then today there was a rain shower that popped up out of nowhere and I was away when it happened.  So. First test of the product!  Came home and found cushions that were soaked!  No 'beading'. No water rolling right off... as the company said it would.  Just soaked cushions.  Oh well.  It was a great theory anyway.  Perhaps this product does work on some things but found it useless on patio cushions.
B00MVMRS6O|5|Bright light, great buy.
B003CJWOY6|5|Used in 1974 CB750.<br />Fit is perfect. They installed quickly and easily, using just the old seals and a rubber mallet to knock into place.<br />Would buy again.
B001BAL7W8|4|Works great! I use it for sanitizing the air after dumping the RV toilet in restroom or port potty.  However amazon is  expensive--better prices at local true value hardware store.
B008N22U28|1|This is a private first class insignia (E-3) Not  an E-4 (specialist) insignia.
B000EDOSME|2|Poorly constructed. Every fitting leaked! I had to replace the entire hose that comes with it with a new one. Besides that the nozzle works well besides that it leaked at first, too. I had to reseal the part where the nozzle screws into the mounting plate.
B000W7K588|3|It does the job. Seems homemade though.
B007EYJTUM|5|My husband loves it!
B00112S8KK|4|The airflow through the finger vents is surprisingly effective. I wish the leather palm was thicker, but for $30 there isn't much of a complaint to make. Most average sized riders would do well to order a size larger than usual, they are a little tighter than you would expect.
B000BR51L0|5|Awesome easy to install great performance boost fit my 1994 kblazer perfect
B004GLBQM0|5|I am obsessed with this kit. It was extremely easy to install (I'm a 21 year old female and installed this myself. I have no background in anything related to this) I installed this kit in about 2 hours in my driveway.<br /><br />I have had these lights for about 7 months now and I do drive with these lights on. I live in Rhode Island and I never get pulled over by law enforcement for them.<br /><br />My next purchase is most likely the interior kit (=

B00069IASY|4|I posted three Bull Frogs 91321 Rust Blocker in my WoodShop on 07/14/15 and they working well.  Highly Recommended.
B003TTV972|5|These is great for filling jet ski-- all the other ones I bought had complicated tops that broke. This is big and basic -- I have two.
B000E7SY16|4|Nice item for the money
B006ZOIJ0S|5|Arrived quickly and does exactly what I needed.
B00HIDHR94|1|The white parts of the logo turned yellow in 3 days. I had to return mine, this is not an authentic BMW item and looks terrible.<br />Left is this product, right is a new original authentic replacement.
B005VKLGUW|4|I am glad this item was available, although I had to return it once and get it replaced because the screw was locked in and would not come off. Once I received the second one, I was able to replace the portion of the key case that I needed.
B000WJJ4U6|5|I knew these snap ring pliers existed before I started rebuilding the master cylinder on my Honda CB. Figured I could make due with the snap ring pliers I had - I'm stubborn.<br />Spent a couple hours swearing and complaining about the engineering of certain master cylinders...<br />I finally bought these and was done in 10mins. Can't speak for other brands, but the tips on the Motion Pros are very sturdy and don't flex when you're dealing with new stiff circlips. You might not use it very often, but you'll be glad you have one when you need it.
B00KTIUG5C|5|It programmed perfect to my 2000 f250

B002ARTH8C|3|It's exactly as it says. Doesn't really hold a shine to well but I like it.
B001ALRQ1E|5|The best ratchet straps on the market! They don't stretch or loosen up at all.

B00FKYS3PU|4|Excelente
B0080HJL7S|5|This bag works good.  It carries enough garbage for my daily commutes.  I really like how it’s super easy to remove from your car to empty and clean.  Only thing I would like to suggest is maybe for this company to add a scented option in the bag of some sort to mask any kind of smells from smelly garbage.  Not sure how they could do this but be a nice option. - item received as part of promo for review
B006JXSORS|5|Love this ratchet strap. I am using it on my beehive and it works perfectly with plenty of length for adding additional hive boxes/supers. Very pleased!
B00Q1F71FA|5|The light was a perfect fit and it shipped to me very fast.  Very pleased with my purchase.
B00DWKXYHG|5|Awesome HID Replacement Bulbs on my Nissan.  I couldn't ask for an easier set-up/fit.

B000C34LFU|5|I have changed both the ac compressor and tensioner to eliminate the belt noises when you start the ac. I lost couple belts until i decided to change the compressor and the ac belt tensoiner to resolve the problem. Product came in a nice packing with superior quality comparing with OEM. Exact fit plus this one has unique spring mechanism which made me willing to try it .Worked perfectly with no issue. Worth every penny you spent.
B00L9CN10Y|4|Works for me
B00UHCP7MM|5|Great fit!
B00S6AIGE8|5|Fairly easy installation.  Lights up the bed really nice. So far so good. Had to get a different switch for what I was wanting to do with them but wasn't to hard to make work.
B00W63X0LA|5|Awesome
B008ZDYLC2|3|It was advertised to include my 2011 Hyundai Elantra as a choice on the vehicle list.  As it turned out, it wasn't.  It did read the ECM, but it didn't reveal the problem.  The reason I was checking was, one of the brake system lights on the dashboard would come on sometimes.  Now it was staying on.  While checking it in the garage I noticed when I pushed the brake peddle, the brake lights didn't come on.  Went down to the parts store, got a new brake light switch, installed it and the brake lights came on every time.  The dashboard light went off too.<br />I'll still use the scanner but it won't show you everything that can go wrong.
B00TA5ECJQ|5|Unlike someone who said you had to pump it, my GasTapper did siphon once I started it going.  The filter was the thing that sold it to me.  I siphoned the gas out of my motorcycle into a container and it worked perfectly.  Started it, kept pumping, noticed when I stopped pumping the gas still seemed to flow so just let it siphon the gas out.  Worked good.
B00FRHODI6|5|Quick shipping.  Product as promised
B0000AXY62|3|Doesn't fit in the standard trailer hitch
B00KXE43R4|5|So stinkin cute!
B000BKJDKM|5|Works well
B0034BRI2A|5|Car is running great!
B00C0SQADQ|1|Doesn't work
B0043M698S|5|It is a very good kit.  You can get the air/fuel mix for what every altitude your trying to set for.<br />  But remember that this is only a jet kit and will not have all the gaskets or O rings, you must get them separate.<br />  Make shure you follow the directions to a Tee, should work find then.  Fred Out.
B00H6ETIWY|1|Not designed to fit a 2015 Polaris 570
B0063CU6GM|1|I did not put this item on my car because it's doesn't seem to look or fit right .... I contacted amazon and the seller of the item to return it and it was to much of a process to return! The item is sitting in the shed unused!
B0061QF9EE|4|As advertised. Arrived in great shape.
B0002STSTY|5|Within an hour after receiving my 3/8 inch set, I got on the computer and ordered a set for my 1/4 inch drive sockets !  These are the best socket holders I have seen, and used. I read some of the comments before purchasing them, and some comments say the magnets are weak, and do not hold the sockets in place. This is NOT the case, after putting the first socket into place (smallest to biggest) I noticed how strong the magnets are. I made a game of it for the remaining sockets, I would put the sockets in place from the end of the rack, gently push it towards the center ( where the magnet is ) and see how far the sockets would get before the magnet would kick in, and &#34;suck &#34; them into place. The standard, or swallow sockets got pulled in about 1/2 inch away from the magnet, while the deeps got 1/4 inch. Once all the sockets were in place, I stood it up vertically, shook it slightly, NONE fell, I even put it upside down, again, NONE fell out. Who ever put the post about the magnets not being strong must be using aluminum sockets !!!!!  These racks are great, I ordered one red, one black (one for standard, one for metric) in 3/8 inch I just ordered another set for my 1/4 inch drive set.
B000I04Z7Q|4|Great product but doesn't come with anything to hold the lights and the two sided tape for the control is weak. Other than that there awesome!
B00E4CQH9S|5|Excellent product - keeps sand out of your eyes on the road and in the woods. (Used in an ATV application.)
B000FOIJXQ|4|Goes on easy but did leave some streaking on the fenders and bumpers of my Wrangler.  Hope it lasts 7 years like it says.  Over all I would recommend this.
B00C2WLPSU|4|Quality is not perfect, but it is very good for what I need. I can't say much about e36 fitment because I run mine in an e30, but with my custom bracket I have no issues in my car.
B001AHI1U8|5|Exactly what I needed, provides me the ability to display all my flags.
B004DZ31S6|4|Just what we wanted.
B00O7ZX19G|5|Funny. Sticks great.
B00TYMSW5U|1|I ordered a different pair from same vendor with great results. This pair was just such poor quality it shouldn't have been shipped.  Lens coatings were uneven and the side lenses had gaps between the frame. Waiting for my return.
B00N42Z4R0|4|Was not the exact fit, but got it to work just fine.
B000GKAZMW|5|Is ok
B0002GXOBY|5|Lights work great. They fit my 1997 Dodge Ram 1500 short bed. I didn't have any trouble putting them in. They are super bright and easy to adjust the angle of the light
B000OO4PCQ|5|bought this for my honda atc 185s  good price came in factory packaging. works great no complaints.
B000CJ71ZG|5|Exactly as described and expected.
B00EW3HNHE|5|Perfect fit
B00NC7VX18|5|Cool beans man
B00KTFPCVS|5|It was very easy to program!  Love it!
B003OBKW5A|1|Amazon says it is right for 09 Nissan Rogue, but the blade config is wrong. I ended up using the refill from the new blade in the orig. blade.
B001V8U3J8|4|Fit perfectly
B009RTJO4I|5|These have always been my favorite socket organizers and I needed another set for my sockets I take to the track.
B0054YMJOW|5|Very durable quality. My sister put it on her car as soon as I gave it to her. Exactly as described:)
B004SCETXU|1|This was not universal
B00BJCHTFW|3|ok
B000EDST2E|5|Fits and works as expected.  Prevents hands from slipping and pushing through the screen.
B00749RQRU|1|The brake lights will Fri when you hit the brakes and like everyone else said the wires are thin I'm going to buy me some wires with the black sheath around them there a hole lot better.
B00LD1J362|5|What can I say? It's OEM.
B00IMUC9YA|5|Love it...
B008G3KG70|5|Better than what I expected.
B00GHK6VDM|5|Perfect fit for my 2008 CX-7 Grand Touring.
B002E58QNM|5|Part redesign from the original but after removing unneeded bracket it fit perfectly.<br />2009 Traverse
B007139UTG|5|Exactly as pictured, worked great, arrived quickly!
B006X8AERW|4|Looks really good,  although there was no instructions it was pretty easy to figure out.  My truck looks awsome.  Prove was great!
B004DRW8ZQ|5|Worked perfect, went on with no problems, easy to install, and  I didn't even have to buy the bulbs since they already came with them. I recommend this product to anyone that needs to replace their Kia Spectra headlights
B00HXVD5D8|5|I Absolutely love it. Very easy to use and works well.
B0085ECSIU|4|Good flow no fuel drop off at high rpm good boost
B009DJOWS0|4|price is great however color and size were off compaired to orignials

B000H961YI|5|It's faster than the 1000 model but not really necessary, unless your vehicle uses a larger battery (truck, suv) or you want the increased charge ability. Make sure you read the instructions, especially when charging in-vehicle. You must put red on positive and black on engine block ground, NOT the Negative of the battery! I like how the charger will let you know if you're not getting a good connection with the &#34;reversed&#34; light. This is a good charger, no complaints.
B001REV81I|5|This stuff is awesome.  I use it on many things - spark plug boots, wire connectors and even to keep sprinkler timer wires from getting wet.  The best thing is that I was able to buy 6 large tubes for a very reasonable price.  Should last me years!
B00JT5CSR0|5|OEM quality and fit
B00RW7WEC6|1|No difference between my 2 year old OEM Honda wipers and these brand new blades...maybe its the style of my window, but they are bad for a few days old.
B0050HZXOQ|5|Good
B00KRQPLGK|4|What i expected 👍🏻👍🏻
B005ZG64N6|4|Nicely done durability will be the ultimate test.
B001V8PRAS|5|Very happy
B00QF0KWHA|5|There are great emblems,  nice and sturdy and stick well
B00KBAJSOS|5|These are good quality for a cut-to-fit mat. It's been over 100 degrees here for several days and there has been NO chemical odor from the mats, and I am very sensitive to chemical smells. The backseat part is a little wide for my Mazda 5, but it does the job. Overall very happy with purchase!
B000CRHMCA|5|Good product, and got it in a timely manner.
B000XG8Q0W|5|These are very handy for hanging the more delicate bags of groceries that tend to get crushed when they're piled together.  The chips, breads, bananas, eggs, always get a ride on these car hooks.  Great product!
B001U7E1A2|5|RV Step Rugs were very good quality, and as advertised.
B008FQRQBM|5|Excellent solution, raises potti a little extra height to add to the comfort height while holding the porta potti in place while underway in the boat
B00WZXEWQI|5|Much better than plastic!
B002INTDSM|5|heavy duty.  Works as expected
B00JC75NCM|4|The color side of the pen worked fine...matched the car color perfectly.  However, the clear coat side of the pen was horrible.  When I applied the clear coat over the painted touch-ups after the paint dried, it made the touched up spots worse.  I have to re-touch it up with the paint side of the pen and not use the clear coat.
B000ALG86E|2|not waterproof and doesn't really help keep the car clean
B00SSKUHAC|1|Fit wasn't perfect
B00VSD6TN0|5|it was perfect i had an idea where to put it salamat po!
B00D754BYG|5|It's not rocket science.  It's a small value resistor that provides a voltage across it proportional to the current passing through it.  I tried it on the bench, and the calibration is within 5%.  Can't ask for better for the price.
B002LLE1ME|4|Installed with no problems!
B004W7KS2C|5|I have been putting hitches on my personal vehicles for over 40 years, this was the easiest one to install by far, took 15 minutes!
B00IMEVECE|4|Could be less expensive but it worked. Easy install came with new steering wheel bolt.
B00GKTZAHS|4|Great stickers
B00H3TMTIW|1|Looks good , but the inside of the outside piece is not as wide as the handle piece. When lifting the handle it rubs on the outside piece. Does not function properly.
B00PGQDYNI|5|I love them
B00SC0ZU00|3|The remotes arrived timely. However, the range is not good. You have to be next to the car to able to activate or de-activate the alarm. All in all it works for the price.
B0006JLW84|5|Just what I expected
B000FQ24V2|5|Real OEM look. I've seen post people saying they shake. Well mine don't. Maybe shakes the heads of all when I pass by on MY Jeep.
B003VGHB9I|5|well satisifed
B000E2CVI8|5|Works great.
B00L83TTZ0|5|The Grilles were easy to install and look great!
B0031HEIDY|1|Was not correct product ordered.
B001PWA0IO|5|I read some other posts about installation instructions not being accurate, but I followed to a tee with no issues.  Maybe they changed the instructions.  Even without instructions, it probably would be a fairly strait forward install as it it would be hard to do incorrectly.
B001GI3LBK|5|After checking out over a dozen other exhaust systems for my 2002 Vette, I chose this Corsa exhaust and couldn't be happier.<br />Much better than the factory exhaust. Car sounds much better, especially at higher revs.
B00AV2HONS|5|These guys are great. I have used them a couple times already out in the rocks as a ramping bridge and in the mud and they are great. Would recommend to anyone looking for a good price Trax compared to the maxtrax brand.
B00IDR0QY2|5|Good product not to hard to install ! Comes with everything u need !
B00DRZDENK|1|This product was not thought through carefully and I'm surprised another effective product hasn't been made, instead of this. This is effective ONLY when your RV is stationary...so what's the point of it??? Save your money and use your imagination to hold your fridge doors open. Its not worth the aggravation.<br />These folks must be experts in ideas for keeping doors open, as they include a couple ridiculous plastic keepers designed to prop open a cooler lid to prevent mold formation inside coolers that are kept closed. I've used a wooden wedge to keep the lid open on my cooler. They need to go back to the drawing board and think of a better idea (other than a wooden wedge for fridge doors.) Until they succeed, use a wooden wedge, you'll be happier.
B003NUGL9S|5|Did what says it does. Fixed a $450.00 Dyson plastic suction and discharge tube. Would have been junk if it did not hold, so gave it a try and still holding.
B002YIACG8|5|Easy to install in a f350!  Don't pay a shop to install this.  There's a wiring harness behind the radio ready to plug it in!
B0000AZ71Z|4|Fit just fine.  Seal could be better.
B00KCP0SF0|5|Perfect fit and good value compared to dealer price. Has been installed for a month and has worked flawlessly.
B00533X5LU|4|Exactly what I expected.  It was easy to apply and looks great.
B00I87HULY|5|I'm pleased with the shipper and the price.  The part fit well on my husband's motorcycle.
B009TC50LE|5|Did exactly what it was supposed to do. Fit perfectly.
B007FGA23M|5|Great purchase to bad I sold the car
B001KS0N9Y|1|f
B004IVGA0G|5|Excellent product it exceeded my expectations well worth the money .
B001JEAIQ2|5|This is a bit of a pain in the butt to install, but not horrible. I had to pry open the hook where the end of this cable attaches to my truck, and then squish it shut when I'm done, but no big deal. It works great. Too bad GM didn't have a more robust method to attach the e-brake release handle to this cable; these things are apparently notorious for busting (but they're cheap enough to buy a spare!).
B007IX14ZW|5|A+
B00RPKOGRQ|1|The device said it fit my car, it did not, I tried to get my refund but I didn't get it yet . It is 21 days now since I shipped it back.
B0042KL7OM|5|Works great easy to use.
B006XKD9W2|5|Good stuff!  Added a touch of elegance to my car!
B00CYLETLY|5|Beautiful and have held up great on my car. I get alot of compliments on these. In fact my best friend is buying a set because mine still look so god after 4 months.
B00FRHOLK6|5|WORKS AS ADVERTIZED CLEANS WINDSHIELD GREAT
B00AMLQ7KE|5|These look fantastic and were easy to install, the dealership wanted $800 for the same thing! CRAZY!
B00B5A5DBA|5|Shoes are great,  a little stiff for walking around but overall not bad for the additional protection you get.  I would say the only nit I have about the shoes is the toe is grey sued material and as such gets markings from the shifter even with a Ryder Clips rubber shift sock.  http://smile.amazon.com/Ryder-Clips-Rubber-Shift-Sock/dp/B005UGIW86.
B00BEKMRXS|4|the starter has worked well since I have installed it
B004MDEV38|5|Great deal, and a good fit for my 2007 Honda Odyssey.  Did not require any holes to be drilled; however, I did need a small wire brush to clean dirt out of the threaded holes on the frame of my vehicle.
B005UYVIXO|5|An improvement in my opinion over the longer setting version of J-B Weld.<br /><br />Very strong and sets in less than an hour (not to max strength,  but it will make a good adhesion).<br /><br />Max strength takes overnight setting.
B00LEBLI82|4|Some don't work
B00IX5MOD0|5|Works great, appears to be good quaility and you get 2 free logos after purchase.  Install took a few minutes (didnt fit my car as advertised but I got it to work!).  Installed in 2 series BMW, showed on Amazon that it would fit, it is off a little but you can make it work.
B000JC7BMY|5|They are what I expected.  I am very satisfied with them.
B000F5ED44|4|VERY SOLID TOOL,IT CUTS BETTER THAN MY OLD ONE,ITS  A GREAT  BUY
B00LH3KXLU|5|Overall great gloves, very good protection.  I was a bit worried that the white gloves would be a little flashy but in person they really look sharp.  The gloves don't breath quite as well as I would have liked but considering they are 100% goat skin they breath quite well if you open your hands a little bit while riding.  One of the features that I found out about after I had received the gloves that I was very excited about was the touch finger on each glove enabling you to use your phone.  Unfortunately its better in concept than reality, I can only get it to work on my iPhone 6 Plus about half the time.  It is truly my only nit about the glove but considering it was an unexpected feature I don't feel it should detract from the overall rating.
B00WRLXXXQ|5|Did not fit and was returned.
B005N6WMHU|3|Smaller than actual size
B001UOOY02|3|they look great. but light output...... not so much
B00JSAGX9A|5|It was fine
B00O0DJAJK|4|Reasonably good quality but one of them arrived with the tab broken.  Since it was an Amazon Warehouse deal, it was probably returned by a customer.  Very nice matte color and it looks good on black standard OEM steel rims.
B001Z0RAW0|5|works great just what we needed
B005SR294U|5|good quality,  good service
B00CAUG7E6|5|I recently purchased a large trash can to hold my recycle trash.  I needed to add a recycle decal to the can so the recyclers would empty the can.  This decal did the trick.  It took several attempts to remove the decal from the backing and stick it to the can.  The instructions are clear and easy to understand.  I just had to repeat the process three or four times, then success.  I'm very happy with the decal.  It's large enough to be seen from 100 feet.  Thanks.
B00J3BW636|5|That little extra to make my SRT standout!  Looks great!
B004EIAADG|5|I like it
B00EHA5C8O|4|AAA+++
B005QIFRD6|5|Great pads and super fast shipping. Totally happy with these
B00ACNMY90|4|it is about what i wanted
B0040CTY5Q|5|Perfect fit
B002PQOGFW|5|Is good
B00HOGC2HW|5|fits great and looks good
B00HEPQKJY|5|GIVES MORE CLASS TO MT 2014 CAMARO SS
B005CW9OQM|4|Worked great and looks nice. The metal it's made out of is a little soft but it did the job
