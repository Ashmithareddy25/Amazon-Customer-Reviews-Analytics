B002IWYXH4|5|Works great! No smell so far, and easy to work. Use the pro tip of leaving in &#34;open position&#34; to not get a puff of stink.
B00BNEBL0U|5|Cute.<br />My daughter loves it.
B002J4U8SO|4|Great price!
B008J4FHZ2|5|Love this bottle!! Super convenient!!  Just make sure the bottom is on tight so it doesn't leak. Have purchased 3 more for gifts.
B00H373C6W|4|This is a great cup, I love all nuk products and am very happy they made a sippy cup with a hard spout as my boy/girl twins both have a mouth full of teeth(14 and 16 teeth, no joke) at 14 months old so soft spouts don't work well for them any longer. However, I ordered two of these hoping that I would receive 1 of each (i know that it says assorted colors and you don't get a choice, I unfortunately was hopefull)...instead I received 2 pink cups. I am going to keep both pink cups.....we can always use a backup. However, I would really like to get 2 of the blue ones for my boy. Anyone have a suggestion?
B0017W4ZTM|1|What a waste of money.  It's some squares of tissue papers on which someone has stamped cutouts of obscure shapes. Save your money; but cheap colored tissue paper instead and cut it into small squares.
B0071MQ0NG|1|Warning my 20 month old bit, broke, and swallowed a stone . Please be aware of this before buying it for child. I had to scoop the pieces of bead out of his mouth and yes he did swallow some.
B0104LDIXA|5|I got this wonderful cover in hopes that it would help my preemie son focus on nursing. When it 1st arrived I instantly fell in love with the colors. Boy or girl.I love the U-shaped neck so you can check on baby.. or have that quality time looking at each other. This covers provides optimal privacy! If you happen to be outside nursing the string on the back provides the security that your cover does not become a frontal cape if a  just of wind picks up, or if you have an older baby that may like to lift it up. There are so many pockets to put just about anything you need to store while feeding your baby. 2 on the underside made of a nice a soft terry cloth, with 3 compartments each. The larger 1 could be used for your phone, keys, ect.<br />This cover has helped me outside of nursing my son as well. I have to pump.. that is very hard to be discrete, i can throw on my cover and have more privacy, monitor the pumps, and not feel like everyone can see.<br />A bottle fed baby could benefit too. I found with my little guy the fabric is pretty light, but helps make for a peaceful quiet spot for him. Whether at the breast or on a bottle, I'm getting that bond that every mother wants! It's  a nice comfortable and stylish way to have these special moments. I wish I had this cover with my other 4 for sure!<br />  * I did receive this product in return for an honest and unbiased opinion of this product. This is a top of line product!
B000XP96VQ|5|I LOVE THIS STROLLER!!! We had some issues with a wheel making a weird noise after a while but one phone call to the company, that's all it took , and they fixed the problem. Great customer service and I am very pleased with the product. I will buy this again and I will definately reccommned them to family and friends!
B000FT9J3K|5|I was looking for a white crib and fell in love with this one. Was so much better than expected although I was reluctant at first given the price compared to other cribs on the market.  Don't waste your money, this crib is perfect! Believe me I browsed around for weeks before deciding and I am truly happy I purchased this model. Perfect size and all. Will definitely recommend it.
B000067PIZ|5|I bought this (elsewhere for a lot less money) because it was the only formula dispenser with 4 compartments - the others only had 3. It holds enough for 6 oz of formula. The formula is easy to get out - you just have to tap it. It's also very compact and fits nicely into the diaper bag. It is hard to get the lid off, but that is my only issue.
B00DYOQQDE|5|This is a great looking booster solid made.
B0009ET49K|5|Should have bought the philips baby bottle pack which includes this brush save me the trouble of buying individual items. Anyway, its a BPA free bottle brush. It brushes. It works.
B0070767DU|5|I purchased this because my milk was getting hard and I was having a lot of breast pain while pumping. This item is FANTASTIC and I wish I had purchased before.<br /><br />* Perfect size -- I place the pump breastshields and the TheraPearl on top and the Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra on top and it is well placed and secure. It covers my breast perfectly and does the job.<br /><br />* Microwavable -- The fact that can be warmed-up on microwave is a HUGE plus.<br /><br />* Milk Supply & Pumping Time -- I always get at least an extra ounce with these and the pumping time is reduced by a little bit.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this for breastfeeding & pumping Moms...
B007MV0YMO|5|I would recommend this to all parents. My baby is a great sleeper at night but didn't like to be put down for asleep during the day. Now when he falls asleep in my arms I pop him in the bouncer and he gets rest while I get the house work done. I can even pop him in it while he is awake and will bounce him softly to sleep. Worth every cent!!
B009P0TKP2|5|We bought this for my son while we were on vacation. He was 12 months old. He loved it. He calls it Twinkle. And he still loves it now. He's 16 months old.<br />He likes to push the buttons and make it change from green to blue. It has a nice projection.<br />It's very sturdy, as he has dropped Twinkle many times. The lights may shut out when he drops it, but push the button and they come right back on.
B0052QYLUM|5|I tried it out last night.  The night vision view is excellent.  Picture clarity is excellent.  Sound quality of the transmission is excellent.<br />Price is excellent.  Hence, 5 stars.
B002V87MJQ|5|love it
B002CVTL6O|1|I bought this as a gift for my niece. She sent me a picture that is competely different than the picture on amazon. The green is bright lime green and the plaid is small blue and yellow checks and there is not solid material on the top. The top is plaid also. I order form amazon a lot but this may be my last. I bought the green bassinet with the large plaid print. That's not what I got.
B004OBZGKA|2|Velcron ripped off after five uses. Amazon refunded my money and I bought the IKEA bibs. Those are wonderful and cheaper!!
B004044LD4|5|Love this product. My child does not sink down in the mattress like ones with springs! No springs here just thick foam. She sleeps great on it and we don't worry about her sinking down and not being able to breath since she is a tummy sleeper.
B007UDKKM8|5|This is absolutely adorable! My daughter (18 months) oohs and ahhs EVERY time she walks into her room! The tree is a little smaller than I was thinking, but that's my own fault for not reading the dimensions more carefully. Overall, we're really happy with it and I would definitely recommend!
B006SFUEF2|4|It is great but the rotating part for the ceiling picture broke..it is about a year old. We bought another one!
B00368CLXW|5|We have leather seats and we didn't want the car seat doing any damage to the leather.  We ended up buy two (one for each vehicle) and have been very pleased with the product.
B001I481LM|4|It feels like cheap plastic, but the mixing mechanism actually works very well. The measuring numbers are clear and easy to read on the outside of the pitcher. Also the pour spout is well designed and easy to pour into small containers. Good overall purchase. I would buy it again.
B0000936LR|4|The Star that attaches to the gym is worth all of the $50 itself. My daughter loved the star so much and used it all the time. She also likes the squeaky duck, which we now took off and is one of her toys. The only thing I wish it had was extra tummy time stuff on the mat itself for her to get interested in.
B001MS83OE|4|My Great-Granddaughter is 11 months and used to being changed on the floor or bed so she not real fond of it but we have a new Great-Granddaughter in May so she will start out on in and I am sure will be much happier on it or I sure hope so, lol
B003UTUEOU|3|Overall, it's a comfortable pillow. However, the material of the slipcover is cheap and scratchy. I washed mine twice with fabric softener and it still was not soft enough for me. I decided to use one of my high thread count pillow cases to slip over the top portion so I could at least have a soft place for my head.<br /><br />The pillow itself is supportive, but be prepared, if you have anything less than a king size bed, it'll be a tight squeeze for you and your partner! Definitely like a third person.
B002IZJJZ2|2|I loved the pattern of these hooded towels, and was super excited about them. When I received them, I was surprised by how thin they were and also short. I have other hooded towels that just seemed better in quality. If you like thinner towels, these are the ones for you.
B002UD65GI|5|My son loves this soft & fuzzy blanket...the best of both worlds:)
B001I459AS|5|It's a good size and looks real cute in son bedroom
B009EDSWJA|5|Love this changing pad does the job and is the perfect size definably a MUST HAVE with a new baby
B003YL3EIW|5|This works excellent!  My son is a water bug and thinks he is bigger then he really is so this made bathtime for him both fun and safe after he got too big for the small infant tub but not big enough to sit up by himself either. The toys are not the greatest but he has other bath toys so that is not an issue.  The only draw back but it's minor to me was it's kind of difficult to wash him bottom and legs but we just saved that for last.  When I was ready to take him out of the bath, I just stood him up and washed his bottom and legs then off we went for jammies.
B00CHQYSVM|5|I like that these are harder to snag the b things unlike the a+a swaddles
B00TR1P0IU|5|My daughter loves this! We received it at a reduced price in return for our honest opinions, so here goes:<br />Pros: fits WAY better in her toddler bed (she is almost 4), and is easier for her to snuggle than a big pillow. It comes with a free pillowcase, which is good (see below), and has stayed fluffy for several weeks. Most pillows are either too thick for her little head, or the thinner ones go flat very quickly.<br />Cons: need special pillowcases. Not a defect, just something to keep in mind: you'll have to buy or make pillowcases in this special size to go with your sheets.
B0061NFNQQ|2|The bumper is short and flimsy and difficult to put on the crib. It's a hassle, plain and simple. The ties don't seem to correspond to the right bars and it's a very muted, kind of ugly color. Don't waste your money on this.
B0049U5UC0|5|I got this for my bff's baby shower, it arrived in a timely manner and is absolutely beautiful :)
B000JWSO9I|2|This doesn't work as a soother because it's just too big. My daughter is teething late. At 17 months, she's finally getting in four teeth at the same time. It has been miserable for her and I thought the rough texture of this soother would help but she can't comfortable keep it in her mouth. She'll play chew for a bit so it's not completely useless. I just don't know how a younger child would be able to use this.
B00JRYSGT2|5|Purchased two of these car seats to go along with the Dragonfly twin stroller for my daughter and she couldn't be happier. Great looking, easy to get in and out of the car, light weight and they snap right in to the stroller. What else can you ask for!!!
B00CXSPL24|4|Wish nipples didn't split so much, otherwise great system.
B004VWH0XI|4|got this for our new born they like it a lot, they sleep well on it. it is well made. it's not as nice as Natural Mat's Coco Mat but it is at about half the cost. the only negative thing we have to say is that the cover shrunk after washing it. thankfully we had another cover from another mattress that fit it just fine.
B00008ODBG|1|Lid pops open all the time, won't stay shut !!!
B001IYD6VM|4|We have a Chicco stroller and the net fits good but does not go all the way down to below the foot rest as shown.  That is not a problem as I figured out another way to make sure my baby's feet are still covered and ensure not bugs would enter.  The reason for the 4 stars is that I expected the product to fit exactly as shown, but the item still works well for it's purpose.  If I would have spent more than $4.99,  I would have been disappointed.
B00BGC3D7I|5|After a year in storahe, my tubes were bent from the way I put them away and the rubber yellow valves were warped from the original set. This replacement kit solved all my problems and I am back to easily pumping again!
B004044LD4|5|Basically, I wanted a very firm mattress for better sleep support and \\"tummy time\\" for my little two-month old girl. I too was a little skeptical about the mattress due to the price, but Amazon reviews pretty much sold it. I am so glad I bought it. IT IS VERY FIRM (I'm not joking - it's firm) and it feels like it will stay that way for a long time. Her old mattress was a Lajobi Gentle Embrace which came free with the crib. Well, you know the old adage - you get what you pay for. The thing was pretty much just a bag stuffed with cotton and after a week our poor baby was sinking in the mattress.<br /><br />The mattress fits fairly snug in a Graco Stanton convertible crib. It's also much lighter than the old mattress. I would 100% buy this mattress again.
B001G2K2BI|5|So we had this on our registry and was a gift.   We didn't check amazon ratings and put this on our list after reading Baby Bargains.   After reading Amazon reviews, I was a little concerned.   However, after almost one week of usage with our new infant, I'm no longer worried.   These bottles don't leak like many other user have reported.   Perhaps they fixed the design or had a bad batch.   The Free Flow works well and there is absolutely no leakage.   Its a little pain to put the nipple on to the ring after sterilization but I can see there are enough silicon around the ring for a good seal, unless the silicon hardens over time and usage, I don't see how these bottle would leak at all.
B004WN7AH2|5|I use this hook to carry groceries into my building, up the elevator, and to my apartment from the parking garage. A great way to not have to make multiple trips. You can fit 7-8 grocery bags on the large clip!
B000BXHPEU|1|I went to use it and it doesn't fit in the toilet. I tried in different style and size toilets and it won't fit or stay still when my son sits down on it.
B002VBXVNO|5|I bought 'Boys Like Trucks Chocolate', actual color looks even nicer than the image online. Chocolate is more like a dark Cherry color. My 5 years old absolutely loves it. Sturdy, Spacious, Excellent quality, worth every penny. Highly recommend. Made in Thailand.
B007B5H1IG|5|not for small children as it does have the small beads for the face but was a great gift for my older nephew when given with a corgi book.  beans re really only in the stomach area the rest of the dog is cotton, not exceptionally floppy. just as described.
B0077M41UE|5|This is fun so show babies animals. My daughter wasn't too into it. Have to dry it off really well after the bath to keep the mold away because the pages stick.
B00QHK8U04|5|I bought this for my granddaughter for her new baby.  She had one for her first child and loved it.  The old one is now at Grandma's house for napping convenience.
B001LF3YQK|5|Holds a lot of wipes and is durable. My original one broke at the hinge after several years and I didn't hesitate to but a new one!
B0078A8HH8|5|Before I bought this product, I was skeptical of the positive rave about it. How can such simple toy be this good? Well, after I saw how my nephew was entertained, I now understand. It's colorful, it has different textures, easy grab and lift and so on. It's a great toy for babies! I highly recommend it.
B0018LYP0Q|5|Gave it to her for her second birthday and immediately took to it.  It's great having a chair just her size that is easily transported but not flimsy like a previous inflatable we had tried.
B000HBMVO0|4|The Valco Universal Cup Holder fulfills its purpose in life; it holds many different sizes of cups and stays afixed to a stroller.      However, it was relatively difficult to attach to the stroller, both because of the need for force and because the directions were godawful.  It also sometimes gets in the way of folding our Maclaren Quest, but this is manageable.      Overall, it is a decent product, but clearer instructions and easier installation would push it up to 5 stars.
B00007DWDZ|4|I got a manual pump from the hospital and when I tried it it hurt quite a lot as probably the flange was too tight.... Then I didn't try and pump till 3 months... My husband and I found the older model on clearance at wags  and thought it wouldn't hurt to try... Trust me it is very comfortable and if Im feeding on the other side I can pump very easily. Only drawback is that the nipple on the attached bottle went bust... shd probably use the bottle only for storage and that it makes some noise... but I guess all of them do... Go buy it for occasional use... I do try it intermittently... Its probably not for very heavy use... I am pretty much satisfied with it
B0058K5IIQ|4|This product has very good quality, it's soft, bright-colored and no smell at all, my baby loves it. So far I have no negative comments for it expcept its price, wish it could be more affordable.
B00BEVF1W6|5|it is very saft carseat , my som like it very much .it is wide ,easy to sit it .
B008LXQW2I|5|Well worth it! Great items!
B000VNVRGM|5|Cute! Hit of the party. Good product...great price...quick shipping. Trifecta!
B00QFPU43C|5|Poli Sippy Cup is a lifesaver for us.  Before I was constantly losing the valves and having to buy new cups.  It cost me $$$, time and hassle.  We have a ton of spy cups in our home without the parts which make them useless.  Poli Sippy Cup is a lifesaver because I never have to dig around for parts.  The small parts are attached and are super easy to clean.  I won't have to worry about mold growing like with the other cups I use.  The other bonus is its easy for my daughter to sip from.  She doesn't have to work as hard to stay hydrated.  We love the bright nursery rhyme art work and my daughter likes to look at it and sing the nursery rhymes.  The spout has a texture similar to a teether so it's tender on the gums and durable.  I didn't like the hard plastic spouts.
B006430ZTI|4|These are very soft indeed. They are long and wide and snap on to the omni softbums diaper. It has two sides, one if you want to line the diaper and one if you want to stuff. Versatile liner. I would recommend this product but the stains do set quicker.
B00CSAWIOQ|5|Bought this for my nephew as it was specifically requested by my sister.  She loves it and my nephew does too.  It is small and durable.  Easy to clean as well.  Great babyshower gift idea.
B0000A1O7P|3|It says don't put in washing machine - but you know you never listen to that - but really, don't wash it. I'm here buying another one b/c I washed both of mine and water got into the seat of one and the cardboard mildewed enough to smell it and the seat caved in. I don't know why companies have to put cardboard in everything...<br /><br />So it sucks you can't wash it b/c crumbs get in every little nook and cranny, but I'm here buying a replacement, so it's not the most terrible product in the world. Lesson learned.
B0132552ZM|5|You know, changing diapers isn't all that bad. Sometimes it's like a crime scene, but the process is quick. But the smell can linger in the room for a long time if you just toss the diaper in the trash. Specialized diaper pails are a good next step, but they leave something to be desired. These Poosmelly satchel thingies really help that last little bit. You just throw them under the liber of your pail and you're good to go. Do you want to open the pail and take a big whiff of it after throwing these in....no. But you will notice less smell when you're just in the room. I haven't tried &#34;recharging&#34; them in the sunlight yet, but it's nice that you can reuse them like that.
B0081BF0M8|4|Arrived on time and as described. Easy to fit to our car and both kids love it. Pros - easy fit into anchor points, firm seating position, seat belt easy access Cons - has some movement, cup holder only one side 8.5/10
B000056JAK|4|These cups don't spill, but the liquid comes out too fast for my daughter.  She's 8 months and still on stage 1 nipples because she chokes easily, so that's not the cups fault.  She was drinking water from these yesterday and had it running all down her chin then choked a little.  So if your baby is fine with a faster flow... go for it!  I'm hoping to use these once she's a little older since they really don't leak at all.  She kept holding it upside down and tossing it and nothing came out!
B001RJUVS4|5|Loved this product!! Worked very well and my son used it all the time. Easy to clean and would buy another but the first one has lasted past my son needing it.
B00003TL7P|2|We had this product for a while. At first it was great, we thought it was better than the Diaper Genie, no need to buy extra bags.  But after 3 months, it starts to smell.  It stinks so bad! no matter how much we clean it, the smell stays around &amp; it only gets worst.  I wish we had kept our Diaper Genie.  Now we are searching for another brand, if anyone of you know another product that don't need special bags &amp; does not smell over time please share it!
B005JN6304|5|Great gate....wish I would have bought this sooner.  Directions were a little vague.....due to the design I had to reverse the gate so it would go flat against the wall when opened.  Hanging was a breeze.  They supply a good template to mount for both sides.  Using common sense, you should not have any trouble installing.
B0013FGX98|4|Great product! When we transitioned our son to the crib, he was always sticking his arms and legs out, and would sometimes get upset when his leg was out and he couldn't roll over. I wasn't comfortable with the idea of a bumper, but I came across this mesh liner and decided to try it out. It fits well, and I feel more comfortable about my son being so close to the edges of his crib now.
B00GEF7DJG|5|My little one loves to be held. I use the Ergo while shopping and I love it!
B004GEC8LU|5|This has been a wonderful next step choice car seat for my son. He couldn't wait to sit in it while I was putting it together. It is exactly what I had been hunting for without having to pay a fortune.
B00DHINGB2|5|Very versatile.
B0018Z6910|5|This swing was great for my little one. She is only about two months but we absolutely love it..Has great settings with mobile movement, sounds, and swing speed..I would highly recommend this swing to a friend and everyone.We put her in it and boom..she's fast asleep so we can catch up on sleep or chores around the house...:)
8279995242|5|I love the fresh clean scent of this spray.  It stays with me all day! It is my favorite go to cologne.
B00AGDACOA|5|this is the only thing that gets my stupid baby to shut the hell up.  He'll only stop crying when he's wrapped up tight like a mf burrito.
B007J0ET9M|2|I ordered these disposable diaper bags a year ago and the quality were much better.  The latest batch are much more flimsy and have a cheaper feel to them.  Once I run out of these, I will be searching for a different brand.
B00004TFLB|5|My 18 mos. old granddaughter just loved it & figured it out immediately! She carries it around & dances to the music.
B0070WGV9K|5|Fast shipping and delivery ! Looks and works great. Just to add some info for next buyers make sure your bad frame end up just before top of the box spring , My bed frame is little tall so now i can NOT use the fold down feature.
B007B5HAUA|5|So lifelike and cute!!!
B009UPUDZS|4|My little munchkin loves Elmo and this set definitely met the expectation. The bowl is a bit small though.
B00009Q1Z4|5|I purchased this stroller after going through several others that never held up. At first I was discouraged by the smal basket and lack of cup holders, but the size and durability of the stroller far outweighed what it lacks. I started out with the Graco lightrider travel system that barely lasted my son's first year. I ended up replacing it because the back wheel fell off and I could not get Graco to send the proper replacement wheel. (they sent the wrong wheels to me and they never fit) My next stroller was a lighter weight Graco stroller. It lasted about six months before the front wheel came off of it. (Both incidents happened while my son was in the stroller. Amazingly no injury happened with either incident) My next strollers were several umbrella strollers. They each would last about 2 months before the wheels would lock up and not function properly. (My son is small for his age, so weight was never a problem) I then bought a double stroller (I was expecting my second child) but, after a misscarriage I no longer needed that one. I then bought the Eddie Bauer full size stroller. (the kind that accepts an infant car seat, but you had to buy the car seat seperately) That one lasted about three months before the stroller would not push straight and it became to heavy for me to lift. I then bought the Graco metrolite. It was in general a good stroller, but I could not fit it in the trunk of my car. I then bought the J Mason sesame street stroller. I was very impressed with that stroller. It was very lightweight, and it folded compactly. It lasted two months before the one hand fold mechanism came off in my hand as I was folding it. I was then issued a replacement at no cost, but after a week of use the replacement stroller's back brake was broken and the stroller was unsafe. That brought me to the purchase of the saavy soho. I have loved this stroller. It is lightweight enough to bring anywhere. I love the acoustic canopy feature. It is almot spring, and I am going to be able to utilize the music feature during summer walks. My son loves this stroller! I would recommend it to anyone!
B00SGP6316|5|This is such a nice change from the usual &#34;baby&#34; smells. Lovely fragrance! The slight grapefruit scent is just enough to lend a soothing and lifting essence to your loving, gentle touches as you bathe your baby's soft skin.. It helps provide such a nice experience! The fragrance does not linger, but the memory of it does. (I found that so very interesting.)<br /><br />The solution is a nice consistency. It is not too thick and it comes out of the pump easily. It washes off easily, too.<br /><br />The bottle is round and a bit slippery in the hand when it is wet, and the nozzle tends to move around as you pump it. But, it is a small price to pay for being able to control the amount you use, and the nozzle tube does extend all the way down to the bottom of the bottle, so you can get every last drop.<br /><br />**I received a free sample product from Puracy.
B00IJJRVR4|5|Worked great and as described
B00KZBJ8AC|1|Smaller than I thought it would be.
B004IDG6XK|3|my 2 year old grandson loves the light
B00B9ZRZFS|3|Chair is cute. It might be a little early for a 3 month old to be sitting in because he tends to lean to the side and would bump into the hard plastic arms, otherwise as he gets older it is working better.
B002BSGWU6|5|Nice
B00BUBNZC8|4|My friend let me borrow her Eddie Bauer cover until I could purchase this one, so my review is based in prior experience with the Eddie Bauer.<br /><br />I like that this has a stiff neckline that bows when you're feeding the baby. It makes it much easier to see the angels face. The adjustable neck strap is much easier to maneuver than the Eddie Bauer.<br /><br />The cover is actually much shorter than the Eddie Bauer. It still covers my 2month old and the Boppy, but just barely. It's probably better to have a shorter one if you're nursing in a confined space, but I preferred the length of the Eddie Bauer. It was more like a blanket over me.<br /><br />The fabric on this one is MUCH softer. It has almost a silky feel. Very nice fabric.<br /><br />The Eddie Bauer has a pocket in the back of the cover for your nursing pad and this does not. Honestly I never used the pocket anyway.
B000AV5LZ8|5|Easy construction an perfect to avoid lifting the little one on to the toilet. Prevents extra strain on your back. Love the handles on top to make the child feel more secure. Fit well on our standard adult toilet.
B007IUYMUE|5|My 4 month old loves this little activity center...I thought he was a little short for it, but waited a couple more days and he has grown into it... I bought this because I wanted something for him to be able to stand it but also have something to play with around him, also he is not ready for a roll-around and the price was much better on this piece than the 2-in-one pieces (roll-around and stand), I will purchase the roll-around when I believe he is ready and then he will have 2 different play time options...
B001J6N7TK|5|This is easy to use.  The bottom clamp does not require any extensive length, like the other brands.  It is sturdy, cushioned and my daughter loves being in it.  I bought a 2nd one for my weekend house and now I am buying a 3rd to keep in our car.  **  We use it in restaurants all the time and she sits right at the table with us - no awkward highchairs that don't have trays.
B004G6NOYI|4|This sprayer works great for washing out our cloth diapers. In the 10 months since we bought it, we've used it on a regular basis with good results: no leaking while turned off and a strong spray while in use (VERY strong if you turn it all the way up). Recently, though, the sprayer button has developed a slight issue. It tends to stick in the \\"down\\" position while the water is spraying out. The only way to unstick (and stop the flow of water) it is to turn off the sprayer at the base -- which works fine, most of the time. One other note: we did end up having a plumber install the sprayer since we could not get it to fit easily on our older toilet; the threads on the fittings just didn't seem to match up.<br /><br />Update (6/10/13): I adjusted the rating upward to 4 stars since I discovered that soaking the sprayer head in vinegar apparently removed some mineral deposits (we have very hard water where I live) -- the button no longer sticks, and water exits the sprayer much more effectively. It's like new again!<br /><br />Update (7/1/13): The sprayer head broke down completely a week ago. There is a little rubber part inside that shredded and caused water to shoot out the sides of the sprayer head. I called the company that makes the sprayer (RinseWorks) and am happy to report that they stand behind their 3-year warranty. They were very helpful with some troubleshooting steps and then explained that they've upgraded the design of the sprayer handle to eliminate the problematic part. They were able to send me a replacement handle, no questions asked, via first-class mail that arrived in about 3 days. I am thrilled to be able to continue using this product and very impressed with the company overall!
B000GK7AMU|5|grandson loves them in the bath they fit perfect in his little hand he is five months old
B004LYALFU|5|I just got the be hip, in lotus lullaby , and I am amazed at the quality. I previously tried the skip hop versa, and jj cole satchel. I bought this as a spring fun bag to take to the park or on a quick trip with my toddler. I did wish that it came with the pic viewer under the flap and would have liked the memory foam changer pad. Those features are found in the other, more expensive bags. I love the material and the hardware it seems like it will last.
B00P0YIUMG|5|adorable little leg warmers! bought these as a gift and they look adorable!
B002W822D6|1|I got this monitor because I wanted it for the temperature feature, but it doesn't even work. It kept saying either 75 or 77 degrees and didn't change no matter how cold or hot the room seemed to be. It didn't go as far as the other monitor I had that said 900 foot distance as well, and the highest volume on this monitor corresponded to the lowest setting on my other monitor. I couldn't hear my baby at all!!! I HATED this monitor and I am returning it! Not worth the money!
B0056S889Q|5|will be picking up another one soon, its quite small and i have it on low so as to not wet my carpet, diffuses quite a good amount of vapor. not using distilled water just tap water for now, will advise if i see anything wrong with that if encountered in the future.
B008BSJWVQ|5|This is the best bottle/sippy cup EVER!!! I SPENT so much money on other sippy cups. I have been trying to get her off the bottle since she was 10 mos old and no other cup would work! She was so stubborn so she is 2 now gonna b 3 in December and this cup finally broke her yay!!!! It took only 3 days I couldn't believe it. She's gone days without drinking with the other cups but this one did it. Thank God I'm still in shock. But it worked!!!! Totally worth it!!!!.
B007X63CYK|3|This product arrived several weeks before expected. They did have a slight odor, as another buyer mentioned but I think it will fade as they air out. The colors are attractive. My only issue is that the description says you can choose your colors. When I sent a message to the seller to tell them my choices (as instructed in the product description) they  promptly replied that the colors are packaged by the manufacturer. I didn't receive any duplicates, but I also didn't receive any greens (which I wanted).  I'm giving a 3 because of the misleading product description, I don't have any complaints about the product.
B00BMAO030|5|I am having a baby and my theme is cars, trucks and trains and this boppy cover slipcover is awesome.
B0031QPQKY|5|Wide and spacious. Everything you need to keep the diapers away from anything else. Because lets face it, its your baby's personal parts we are talking about.<br />Goes perfect with any Dr. Seuss diaper bag
B004YN9RL2|5|I love this bag it has pockets for everything! Easy to travel with. I like that it's big and I love the cooler on the side.
B00N8B6MSM|5|These bibs are great for my super drooly girl!
B0011EB814|5|My wife really likes the Medela brand of Lanolin.  Having previously used the Lansinoh she liked the texture and quality better.  It was a better value per oz too!
B00HI8BKRE|4|This kit does the job. I don't love that the shields are not detachable from the connector, makes it difficult to clean. But overall a great value.
B000G7OMBK|5|This bed is exactly as advertised, and has been so portable - much easier than our pack and play to take around to different places. We even used it in the park. Small and light - just great!
B00IE0IY1U|5|So great!
B000JJK9EY|5|I love this product, as we have travelled a few time now and we needed a car seat at arrival, this is the way to go.  Really practical, quick and easy... lot of people have asked me about it, especially because they were tired of taking along and the car seat and the stroller.
B00LD8ZD0K|5|What a fun way to introduce books to children. There sturdy almost indistructible and kids learn and love them.
B007P7WEDM|5|Worked well and looks like the photo -very colorful
B004VL2VRO|5|I bought this monitor for its crystal clear picture. Your able to add more cameras to function with the same monitor.
B00MRZIFD0|5|it takes time for my Lil one to learn but im loving it! spill free it is!
B007HTLSBW|1|This product was a big lie! The picture on line made it seem it is as large as the wall but, it's barely 20 inches high! I was going to put it on my toddler's wall and dicovered how small it was! I am returning this product! So disappointed!
B001GQ2RV2|4|Between the musical bear and all the hanging toys this activity gym has provided hours of amusement for my 6 month old little girl.
B005TKX98Q|4|It was okey
B00MVA3J4G|4|I love this bag! I love the colors, the style, the fabric and everything about it. It's gender neutral and perfect for me. Having a little boy it allows me to feel feminine and still let me carry his stuff in it! I only wish the extra bags inside were just a TAD bigger so I could fit more of his knick knack items like diaper cream and tylenol inside
B005DOS2EE|5|...very nice gate. Great quality and solid. Cannot adjust like a conventional gate. There are two pivot points on the gate that allow both ends to adjust accordingly. However, a 39-40 inch walk way will push the gate out 14 to 16 inches on both ends. It ended up working for my set up. Top of stairs. One side of gate folded in 90 degrees and mounted to the wall. Other side straight and zip tied to the stair railings. Great quality gate. However, ensure this gate meets your requirements. After reading the product description entirely, I made an assumption that the gate adjusts like a conventional adjustable gate. Can't knock the product for my assumption.
B00CG3CCWS|5|Love
B00HAZSCOY|5|super cute swaddle! i love the print on this swaddle and the fabric is fantastic (great for warm weather). the swaddle is easy to use when compared to traditional swaddle blankets.
B0058SIQW8|5|Very  very very cute growth chart that will last many many years.  It will hold up very well and add to any little girls room.
B008KW8IWW|5|Such a cute chair!!!! Sometime tricky to keep clean with toddlers but they love it!
B00A9YW6F4|5|Neat play pen. Looks great, certainly comes in handy. You can take it away with you on weekend trips, divide up the room. Love it!!!
B001G4RWG4|4|Their great
B008FONS7U|5|I love these nail clippers for my little one!  The fun and colorful design doesn't seem as &#34;scary&#34; as the shiny metal ones and they are the perfect size.  I also like that a cover for the top is included for safety and sanitary reasons.  I highly recommend these!
B004O90VMK|5|I have a very feisty 17 month old who loves to chew on the sides of his crib; however, these rail covers worked perfect to keep him from doing so.  I thought for sure he would be able to pull them off as they are just secured with velcro, but I have had them on there for a few weeks and so far so good.  At first he did pull at them and so I had to readjust, but now he just leaves them alone.  Also, one other note, he has a convertible crib with pretty bulky side rails and these covered them just fine with room to spare.
B007SY4KMA|3|I am disappointed in the range of the monitor.  I have the monitor in a bedroom immediately off the living room and more often than not I cannot hear my husband in the bedroom.  He has a medical condition and I need to be able to hear him if he needs my assistance.
B0038OM4PO|5|Gate looks and works great at the top of my stairs to keep my dogs from going upstairs when I don't want them too.  We walk through it easily with one hand.  I get a lot of compliments on the looks of it, so much prettier than a typical baby gate.  It was easy to install.  And it does get off balance from time to time, but I just give it a tap and it's back straight.
B001EWDYBA|4|Would have given this four and a half stars but they don't have that option. The reason is it could have been a little bit bigger than what it is yes it's cute it's worth the money if you don't have to pay shipping other than the size I would give it 5 stars. Can't wait for my nephew to be born so he can have his snoopy all in all that's who it's for.
B00GULB11U|5|Love this pack and play. Everyone asks where I got it from. The only problem is the changing table is really low and can be hard on the back. The changing table is also small because my 21 1/2 in 1 month old will be to long for it soon. Everything is easy to remove and wash
B0050GD2EU|4|Held up well during airline travel. Perhaps the bag handlers weren't as rough as they usually are so it turned out well.
B00BLYMWEQ|5|Butt thanks you. Tant you very much
B00NBS0YXG|5|love these!!
B000FIMXIE|4|My daughter really enjoys this tent.  She is 21 months (almost 2 years old and she has the time of her life with this tent.  My only complaint would be that it is a little more time consuming to fold than I thought it would be, but otherwise this is a great gift!
B007NG5UGS|5|I love this monitor. We bought it after returning the Infant Optics DXR monitor to Amazon. It was simple to set up, works properly and has great video quality. I think this is the best monitor around in this price range. I did a lot of research and I am very happy with this purchase. I don't think you will be disappointed with this purchase, especially if you had another camera to compare it to as we did.
B004N2M7HK|5|Excellent. Son had a wail of a time.....for the little time he used it. Started walking a few weeks after so i had to give it away. Good buy. Amazon never disappoints.
B000IZVCM2|2|I bought this seat from Walmart because it looked like it would work well, take up little space, it was a reasonable price and to tell you the truth there weren't many other seats to chose from. This was for my 2nd child. With my 1st daughter I used the simple sponge that worked great for less than 5 dollars! But, to my surprise this time around the sponge that I loved so much was no longer available. So, thinking that this cute seat looked promissing I bought it, which I have come to regret ever since. It is a good price, yes, and it doesn't take up much room, but that is about all the good there is. It makes bath time very stressful for mom and dangerous for the little one! No matter how big baby is, or what position the chair is in, my little girl is constantly sliding down into the water. She could easily drown if I was not constantly lifting and pushing her up out of the water! There should be more support under the babies bottom to prevent them from sliding down continually! I may be super mom, but it is still impossible to get the soap, washcloth and scrub her down while trying to hold her in place!<br /><br />And if that wasn't bad enough... After a few uses even if left to air dry between baths,the dang thing starts to smell like milldew!!  I took the cloth off and washed it with detergent in hot water, but the smell still did not go away! It made my babies head smell! So no, I will not be recommending this bather! I want my freshly bathed babies head to smell clean and nice..not like an old dirty towel!!<br /><br />I have nothing to gain or to lose by writing this review. I just wanted to let other parents out there know how I felt about this seat. Mabe it will stop someone from making a bad purchase. I would wish that the creaters of this product would consider the safety of babies using it,and work on its design. Now that my baby is sitting I am using a plastic chair that she sits up in, but if I ever were to have another baby I would go back to using asimple sponge. If it ain't broke don't fix it!!!!  Ha
B0024VE7GG|1|I got this for my son a while back, but didn't post a review. He had been taking this to school for several days before I, quite by chance, took a swig of water from it. The water tasted odd- like a metallic taste. There were no stains, rust, etc. I cleaned it regularly, and tried again after a thorough cleaning- same taste when the water stays in the bottle for a few hours. Needless to say, my son isn't using it anymore. I was looking for something else when this popped up, and I thought of writing this late review. HTH!
B004FMAMNY|4|After I realized that I had stashed my classic style Ergo in my husband's car and didn't even miss it for months, and that I just liked this one better, I decided to sell the Ergo and keep this one.  I liked the Union better, because the material is easier to clean (can just be wiped with a wet cloth in most cases), the shoulder straps didn't keep slipping off my shoulders like the Ergo's did no matter how much I adjusted it, my son's weight felt better supported and distributed to my hips by the stiffer bottom portion of the Union's seat area, and I liked the additional buckles on the sides that kept him from throwing himself backwards and out of the carrier when having a meltdown.  I have used this carrier with him from the age of 16 months to 2.5 years, and even with his older brother on occasion, so I cannot attest to how well this works with littler babies, but for toddlers it's awesome!  For newborns, I recommend the Moby or a similar style wrap that supports the head well.  For older babies, I liked the mai tei and sling style carriers the best.
B001DU0LGY|5|I have put pieces of furniture together before. I took my time with this one as usual. Everything was explained in words and pictures. All parts were there and this piece looks great. Glad to have it.
B00124EH52|4|I bought two of these for my twins. My primary car seats are Britax Roundabout 50s. Comparing those to these is like comparing a Mercedes to a Kia, but these Cosco seats are perfectly adequate for my second car that I use for quick trips to the store on weekends and sometimes for short trips to or from daycare during the week. I give them four stars rather than five because (1) they aren't blue as advertised (they're black) and (2) I had some trouble installing them rear-facing using the latch system in an Acura TSX. I had to get a really strong neighbor to pull the straps tight enough. It takes brute force. Also, the seats don't recline quite as much as I would like them to. When I tried putting a pool noodle under the front to recline them more, we couldn't get the latch straps tight enough. Another thing potential buyers should be aware of: Some Cosco Sceneras seem to have more padding in them and have higher quality fabric than others. I looked at a couple of Sceneras in a Target store that were cheaper than the pair I ultimately bought here at Amazon. The Target seats had no padding in them at all and had really cheap fabric. The seats I bought from Amazon were, I think, $10 or $15 more expensive but have nicer fabric and extra padding.
B00007LP11|5|I have a version of this carseat and absolutely loved it.  I read all the reviews before I got it and consulted my friend who happens to be a certified carseat tech.  The main complaints I noticed in the reviews were that the fabric was hot and the seat was too small snd outgrown quickly.  My son just outgrew his seat a week ago and he is 6 1/2 months old.  Frankly, he was just too heavy to be lugged around in it anyway so that didn't bother me.  Also, the narrow size of the seat makes it a very safe and cozy seat for a newborn.  I borrowed another carrier (the other famous one) from my friend for a trip and was not pleased with the way my baby fit in it at all.  his head flopped over when he fell asleep - even with the headrest!! I only had to use the head rest in my Primo Viaggio until he was about 10 pounds and his head never once flopped to the side in that seat.  I never noticed the fabric being an issue, all carseats seem hot - especially rear-facing ones since they don't get direct air usually.  If you travel much by airplane - be advised that this seat always has to be installed with the base.  I purchased a carseat carrier - snap and go - and it worked beautifully with this seat.  i say go for it, you won't be disappointed and your little bundle will be safe and secure:-)
B00MS2I0BE|3|Didn't rec'd one item in package and was bit disappointed.
B00AHO5SO2|5|Stocking stuffer for my little peanut--was a great little gift
B0009RNXNA|5|We have a Britax Marathon and it fit great in this bag. We traveled cross country and then a few weeks later moved overseas and this bag held up just great and kept the car seat clean and protected. My only complaint is it doesn't have wheels (my mistake for not reading the description well enough. I assumed since it is described as &#34;ultimate car seat travel bag&#34; it would have wheels- I researched different bags and must have been mixed up thinking this one had wheels.) It's a bit bulky to wear on your back through the airport but definitely do-able and makes traveling much easier. Would definitely recommend this bag to others.
B001NJC5QY|2|The tray was hard to get lined up and it did not work well to feed my kids with.  I ended up selling it at a garage sale
B0009RNXNK|4|Great item! Only fits 3 nine oz Avent bottles though. (Including ice pack). Keeps cool for many hours. Happy with product.
B003CLIGX2|2|The \\"music belt\\" case is pretty nice but honestly, we haven't used the case yet.  I could barely hear the speaker while it was muffled behind the fabric/cotton so we pulled the speaker out.  To our amusement, it was a cheap $1 speaker that had the same output as a basic ear buds.  So my wife puts the speaker directly to her belly, under her pants so the baby can hear.    The earbuds for the mom are actually pretty nice.  The case is nice.  The actual speaker for the baby (the reason you buy this thing) is not so great.  Maybe thats all the baby needs though?  Hindside, I would have just stuck the basic ipod speakers to the belly and saved my money.
B002VJJDLK|4|purchased this but it is little used.  older child pulls on the toy bar and it pulls off or snaps completly.  (ours broke within one week) now that the child is one and eating in high chair we dont use the cover at all.  I dont think it is/was used often enough to justify the high price we paid.
B004MEY4UC|5|If you use the bottles, you need this!
B004OBZGKA|5|Total coverage is essential when feeding my 7 mo old. This was perfect. Just need to buy a couple more. Is durable and fits nicely. Just throw IT in the washing machine whenever it needs washing.
B00005UC6D|4|My sister bought this for my cousin's baby shower and she says that it works great!!  She really loves the fact that there are handles on the clippers and scissors so it will prevent from slipping out of the mother's hands.  She also loves the bathtub thermometer.  I would love to have this as a baby shower gift!
B008289KMG|3|This seems to be sized for under a year, though I can't imagine getting a baby to sit still enough to put one on. My 17 month old son barely fits it out of the box so we won't be using it long.
B000FOH4JG|5|Lovely case, makes perfect gift for grandchild to treasure
B00E4BFXOY|2|Plays 1 line of twelve songs, not 12 songs! Works, and my two month old doesn't care but the parents find it a little annoying.
B00BS8IIK2|5|very very cute. super soft and light. it's holding up bring bitten and thrown around.
B0028MOOJG|1|It's bulky and does not provide easy handling.  I had hoped to use this with my 2 and 12 month old for errands....i was pretty disappointed.  Now i'm scrambling to return it on time so I don't have to keep it and try to resell it.
B005G0GLFM|4|My husband installed easily.  The only con is that it drips a little after each use.  I'm not sure how that would be fixed.  Otherwise is an excellent, durable, sprayer!
B008ALZ466|1|the product description is incorrect... it does not fit all avent bottles!!!!<br />please update so others are not spending money to put in the trash.... =/
B006WLDKV2|5|My daughter loves this seat.  My husband and I love this seat.  It is comfortable for our tall 13 month old.  Her head never tips forward while sleeping in it. It fits perfectly in the back seat of our GMC Sierra...it is the ONLY carseat that will fit rear facing in the back of our truck.  We will be buying a second one for our other truck.  We love it!!!
B00HMGBJCS|3|I purchased this boppy for my son thinking the color was white. Looks pretty white in the picture and even looks white on the packaging. However, the actual color is more of a light yellow- almost the color of something that was white but has been stained by lots of cigarette smoke? I don't know how else to describe it. The pillow itself is fantastic- i love all boppy pillows. Shame the color isnt true to the picture.
B00B2N0E3M|5|SO convenient for travel and weekends at the lake. Easy to set up, basically an entire baby room set up on the go.
B00MDMLT9Y|5|I'm surprised by how much my baby loves this thing. It just seems like some weird piece of plastic, but oh man, she spends 5-10 minutes at a time absorbed in chewing this thing.
B009YDCH2S|5|Really cute, my one year old daughter loves it.
B008A8496U|4|I didn't expect this to be of the highest quality since it was only $5, but it was still decent. I actually ordered it for my dogs - a blanket to put in their pin that they sleep in and a toy to play with all in one.
B000XT30G4|3|I have an older house.  Hard to keep it on my wall and rail.  My son has it in his house works great for him
B0055RWQNM|4|My gorgeous little granddaughter loves these cute hooded towels, Nana is very happy with them
B0018Z06P0|5|Fits great, seems comfortable, cute print. Not sure whether they contain the poop, don't see how that's possible with liquid-y newborn poop anyways, but in the ocean it doesn't matter.
B0045I6IA4|5|It's nice
B00BKXEJGC|1|I am not pleased with this item at all. I ordered it because the reviews I read were very positive; although, I did note that most were written by parents of little boys. I have no doubt that it works just fine for boys. The problem is that I was looking for something for my granddaughter to use when she comes to visit. The key word there is &#34;grandDAUGHTER.&#34; The penis guard creates an obstruction for her, certainly when she tries to sit down without help, but even once seated. The price was certainly reasonable; I didn't want to spend much since it's used solely on her visits. However, I did have an issue with the fact that Amazon listed it at $8.99, and then it jumped to $10.99 once in the cart. I even tried deleting the item, going back, and selecting it again. $10.99 is still quite reasonable; it was the principle of the thing that bothered me. If you are looking for a potty chair for a little boy, I think you will be quite safe following the positive reviews given. On the other hand, if you're looking for something for a girl, a model with a removable penis guard might be the better way to go, and that's precisely what I will be doing as soon as I finish this review! :)
B001D22R0K|1|Ok I can give you a full detailed look at how well these work. I have owned and used these for 2 years and 10 months and I can tell you that they are a horrible horrible diaper I have 8 diapers of this brand all together and every single one of them leaked and was a complete mess if my DS ever made a poo. Thankfully I am a seamstress by profession and was able to change the design of the diaper to where they would be useful, and I would not be throwing my money away. (Sewing in more absorbent core and using a special type of fabric glue on all the stitching so that they would not leak through. And sew on a micro fleece top layer to protect my child's skin and after about 2 years I had to replace the Velcro do to it no longer sticking)  This CD stains very easily as well, and because of the fabric that is used for it when you dry them (dryer or Laundry line) the fabric gets very scratchy and WILL rub the skin off your child. I did keep 1 diaper as it was made and used it with the others just so I could fill out one of these reviews one day.(AND IT NEVER HAS WORKED) I have also used Dry Bees pocket Diapers and even the Dry Bees Night time version I DO NOT RECAMEND THIS BRAND EATHER also leaks badly. I have a couple other brands I also don't recommend but I don't feel like listing them (feel free to contact me for info if you like) there is one Brand out of the MANY that I have tried that I do recommend Monkey Doodlez AIO diapers they are a brand that comes in many sizes so they can get to be a bit pricey but VERY VERY worth it. This brand dose everything its suppose to do they never leaked and I only had to use a doubler at night and my DS wets very heavy at night, this brand I do suggest.
B0009K9HTQ|4|I originally wanted a bassinet to sit at my bedside, to be able to push it away for me to either sit or stand up to reach my son at night and the wheels and side entry make this very convenient.      What I liked:  (1) It has several music choices which my son enjoys and you can raise or lower the volume; (2) There's vibration which also can be changed in intensity; (3) Side entry which makes it easier to reach my son; (4) wheels which is helpful for when I need to get out of bed; (5) low level light - this is a great feature because I can put it on to frequently check on my son however, do so without waking up him or my husband; (6) mobile swings out of the way depending on which side you pick up your baby     What I found unhelpful/ineffective: (1) My biggest issue with this bassinet is the mattress.  It is too soft and flimsy and after only 2 weeks' use, developed a concave imprint where my son mostly sleeps so any movement is restricted.  However, I did contact customer service to inform them and even though I was told that this is an uncommon complaint, the woman was very accommodating and is sending out a new mattress, free of charge, no questions asked (nor receipt requested).      (2) The other thing is that my son has reflux - which, I've heard, is common in newborns, and we need to be able to raise the head of his bed as instructed by our physician.  Since the mattress has no \\"backbone\\" and loses shape, propping up one side of it causes the rest of the mattress to be at an uncomfortable angle, hence not an option.  We have to raise up the base of the bassinet on several textbooks which makes it difficult for me to now get out of bed or move it around on the wheels because the books will fall out.  Perhaps it was not possible for Kolcraft to build in this feature of raising up the head of the bassinet because it is not considered safe by the American Academy of Pediatrics?  Not sure about that...    Overall, it's a pretty good bassinet, meeting most of ourneeds.
B00JWIMHM0|4|My girlfriend wrote this review: I did not recently have a baby, but I wanted something to help me hold in my abs while losing weight. I read numerous reviews and thought this would be the best product for what I needed and not too expensive. Pro's: it is not very hard to put on (unless you have arthritis); material is comfy as long as you keep the Velcro on the material and away from skin; holds skin and tummy in well if you are short-waisted; is washable; helps compress loose skin. Con's: after several days of wear, the top and bottom edges roll; it doesn't cover my upper abs and lower abs at the same time, so I had pooch at one end or the other no matter how I wore it; shows under fitted garments; back flab pooches out over the top. If it had about 3-4 more inches in height, it would have been perfect for what I wanted. For the price, it was worth it.
B0038JDVCY|5|Love this gaget.  It is the best thing since silced bread.  I use it all the time at my son's house when I have to cleanthe containers for milk or juice. Great idea.
B002YGSBGS|5|I love this seat!  My 2 and 4 year old really enjoy sitting in this seat.  I love the colors too.  It cleans off very easily.
B0018CKHDY|5|These bibs have wide coverage, great velcro, a pocket and very cool patterns. Our favorite are the Dr. Suess. These are easy to wash or wipe down and slightly harder for my son to get off. Although if you have a pretty persistant baby they might be to easy to get off. They are water proof but the more you wash them the less water they repel. I do hand wash them which has helped extend there life. These are the only bibs I use.
B000VZKGYY|5|this is the #1 toy i would recommend to everyone if your buying a gift or for your children. my daughter loves this even 2 years later now that she's 4. it's bright and really pretty
B0009OLSZ8|5|Excellent product, especially like the high back for support.  This worked like a charm and within one week our grand-daughter was using it.
B0006HJDQE|5|The look and design of this changing table is delicate, soothing and very, very pretty. The drawers and spaces are functional and of a good size. It's not complicated to assembly, but yes, it does require a couple of hours. Instructions are clear and easy to follow. It says it requires two people to put it together, but my husband did it by himself. We didn't have any problem with shipping or damaged parts... everything arrived as it was supposed to be. It looks very gorgeous along with our baby's white crib and other furniture pieces. It does not seem cheap at all; all parts are sturdy and well-made. YOU HAVE MY RECOMMENDATION here.
B0027AW8R4|2|We were very excited to get a lightweight stroller that looked so trendy.  The weight and portability were great at first, and it makes a great base for a car seat if you buy the graco car seat adapter. With the car seat adapter, the seat is also higher, which is one complaint about the stroller.     But within months, there were two massive problems: 1) The brakes stopped working most of the time, unless you kicked it a few times til it clicked in, and 2) The middle recline level did not hold, making the seat wobbly and uneven.  Compounding this was the fact that my wife had trouble folding it in the first place, and we needed a new stroller. Problem #1 is the reason the stroller was recalled, although they just sent out a brake kit to fix the problem.     Fast forward a few months, and my daughter is an 18 lb 6 month old, and she is already busting out of the stroller.  So do not listen when it says the weight range is 40 lbs, because that is only true if your child is tall and 40 lbs, but if you have a heavier infant (my daughter is only in the 50th percentile), this is not the stroller for you.    I did call Bugaboo, and they were very nice (after the long wait time) and agreed to send me a new stroller since mine was clearly broken.  But I will not be recommending this stroller to people anytime soon.
B000LK6KOO|2|The straw on this is great and the straw doesnt spill easily.<br />The lid is what has ruined this cup for us.<br /><br />Everyone on here has been saying you have to assemble right or put the top on right buut no matter how many times I put the top on,it always leakes.<br />If it falls over or is tipped to far to the side it starts leaking.<br />I gave up on these and went back to Playtex which are leak proof and you can use any top for any cup(straw, sippy, bottle type will all switch with eachother).
B006SFUDQM|5|Just right
B00138YI7Y|4|My son had some trouble with another sippy cup (the kind with the valve) but he took to this one right away. It was very easy for him to figure out. It was recommended for 6+ months when I bought it at the store. I only wish it were a bit smaller and had ounce markers on it. I love that it comes with a cover to keep things clean.
B005TE0N1S|1|Looked slot bigger but was disappointed it was so small!
B002WN2C0E|5|this is a great product, our 6 mth old loves it. the tray snaps on securely and removes easily. clean up is a one wipe job and its deep enough that spillage stays in the tray!
B00CWN8IK2|1|Bought this in September, is leaking like crazy now (Feb.) underneath the base. Seems a little dangerous to me and it was in my baby's room.  Besides that, before it started leaking it always for some reason got the floor and everything wet around it, unless on very low and still sometimes did even then.
B00BZAI6AU|4|Our granddaughter love the car.  Did I say that our grand daughter loved the car.  OK her brother liked it too.
B004GIJL2U|3|too small
B00GUOZZNC|2|I really like this monitor and all of the features it offers. Unfortunately, the parent unit simply wouldn't turn on one morning after less than probably a full year worth of use. I have had it since my son was born in June of 2012, but the monitor was only used until December or January as I loaned it to my sister in law when her premature triplets came home from the hospital. She transitioned to a monitor that could be linked to multiple cameras when they moved the babies out of their room.<br /><br />I now have a second child and one night when I attempted to turn the parent unit on (after charging it the entire day) it wouldn't come on. I promptly ordered new rechargeable batteries which didn't solve the issue, so I called Angelcare to find out their recommendation. They had me switch out the power sources to determine if the cord was bad, but when that didn't work either, I was told by Lindsay (who was very nice) that I had to purchase another parent unit for $54 and some change.<br /><br />I paid $200 for this unit and at that price point,<br />I expect to get through 2 kids! Since I was assured this is a &#34;very unlikely thing to happen&#34;, I felt it should then not be a big deal for the company to replace the unit for me at that price.<br /><br />Needless to say, I'm disappointed and now without a VERY expensive monitor which works perfectly other than the parent unit. Such a waste, I would have preferred to spend my money on another camera to begin with as I now have had to in order to have a working monitor for my infant.
B00H8MR88A|5|This is by far the easiest assembly ever, the quick action fold is amazing (one hand yea!!!) I love it another great Graco product.
B0039MIV7K|4|We've had this now for a few months and no complaints. Our 2 year old has a destructive side and she hasn't ruined it yet either. Very substantial with good weight and easy smooth moving drawers. I read the only review on this recently and thought they must of gotten a bad one ours is perfect. We paid $400ish I wouldn't want to pay anywhere near the $900 listed price that we see now.
B00HE2HFFK|5|Love it. Came as scheduled
B00UV7G8H6|5|Great quality! Love these!
B0032KHKHQ|1|I received it in a nice packaging, but was disappointed by the color at the first sight. The color is oldish, like it was used and washed hundred times. When I set them up, there is a stain on one of the wall decor. The worst part is, I got them from baby registry, and it is not easy to return like other stuffs on the registry.
B006ZSYIAY|5|Love these. A must have for all new babies. Great idea as a gift. All three of my kids love these.
B00CXVT1I6|5|a perfect fit for a 32 year old bassinet!! Love it
B001H0GEXY|5|This car seat has met our needs very well.  Our child became to big for his infant seat at 7 months so we needed a car seat that could still grow with him i.e. front and rear facing.  He sustained a neck injury at birth so comfort was also a concern but we didn't have the money to spend on a Britax.      I love this seat because:    * Most everything on the car seat is straightforward and easy to use  * In rear facing there are 3 adjustable recline settings   * In forward facing 2 adjustable recline settings are available.  We still use the most recline we can to help with sleeping in the car and all around comfort.  * 5 point harness fits snug and secure  * Harness buckles are not too tight and difficult to use like some cheaper car seat models we have tried.  * Though the built in pillow doesn't prevent his head from slouching to the side during sleep it offers a nice padded and safe wedge to hold his head up when a blanket roll is placed beneath it.  * He is very comfortable in the seat.  * The shoulder straps adjust as needed for the child's growth but also remain snug even though they are adjustable.   * Safe up to 50 Lb.     Improvements could be made on:  * The shoulder straps by the neck have no padding and can become abrasive the the baby's neck.    * Obviously a better instruction manual.  * The cup holder is floppy and kind of worthless.    He is old enough to be forward facing now and the seat provides a nice height for him to enjoy the outside world but also be snug within the car.  We drive a Chevy Malibu.  This seat is worth the extra $20 to $30 you might spend on a cheaper model.
B00161QIUS|5|....baby loves to watch these float around....she is 9 months now....very cute birds....
B001KZ008G|4|I was happy with these pads.  They are very thin with decent absorbency! They never feel wet on my skin. Only odd thing is that the 4 pairs that came were all different sizes!  I would have rather all of them be the large size.  But I will buy a second order of these.
B00006IJRU|1|We just recently had our 3rd child.  We used the J &amp; J Healthflow bottles for the 1st 2.  Was sad to see they have discontinued these.  We bought the Ventaire bottles and have not been happy with them at all.  The stage 1 nipples are way too slow.  our baby couldn't get anything out.  It took almost an hour to feed him 3 ounces!  We went to the stage 2 and it's way too fast!  He's only 3 weeks old so the stage 1 is really what he needs, but with these nipples they just don't work.
B00KCNJE9S|5|This rather simple-looking feeding bottle for newborns has all the right angles.  It's ergonomically designed and fits well in adult hands, and later baby's hands can hold it, too.  The wasp waist design makes this easier to hold over a long period.<br /><br />The wide top and natural shape make this comforting for the newborn.  The entire bottle is clear plastic or silicone, which makes it easy to clean and assemble.  There are only three parts to this design, not including the cover.  There is no chemical smell to this bottle. I also had no leakage when first trying out this bottle
B000Z3DWHK|5|We purchased two of these from a chain retail store, as I wanted one with the wood colored drawer, not the painted white drawer. I love them! I was a bit concerned about the quality of the wood based upon other reviews, but the quality is actually very nice. Yes, the wood is a little soft, but it's not horribly soft. Also, my thought was, I know that every teething kid is going to chew on their cribs, as it's just natural to want to chew everything during that stage, and I would prefer for them to chew on a softer wood, then a harder would which could do damage to the teeth or gums. The assembly was easy (for my husband). Everything fit together nicely and the drawer slides really smoothly. This was a great find for twins, when we're short on space. We use the drawers to store their extra blankets, sheets, sleep sacks and burp cloths. I heavily researched a lot of cribs before committing to this purchase, and the company customer service was very helpful at providing me detailed information on the paints and woods used, and even went into detail on how the wood was harvested. The company employs environmentally sustainable practices in harvesting which was important to me, and its just an added bonus that the crib is modern and stylish. Some reviewers suggest that it's difficult to find a mattress that fits. We used the [[ASIN:B003BIFNYQ L A Baby Organic Cotton 2 in One Orthopedic Crib Mattress, White]] and it fits perfectly --- snug enough to prevent the mattress from sliding around and the baby from getting stuck between the mattress and the crib, but just enough space so that it's not too hard to remove for sheet changes.
B007E8RSL0|3|I found this carrier's straps to be uncomfortable and returned it right away. It rubbed my shoulder blades raw in both types if front carry, although the cross cross front carry was more comfortable. I didn't like the way I had to pull towards my back to tighten the straps (opposite of the ergo, you pull downward). I loved the way it looked and liked that there were no straps to rub against my 8mo old sons arms, but at the end of the day I have to go with comfort.
B0019QCGVK|5|My little girl loves this. Its light weight, colorful and easy to carry everywhere. Many different textures for a baby to feel and taste
B0006FHB5Q|5|We're getting older...After a recent fall in the tub by my significant other we purchased just one of these but after using it we ordered 3 more...They attach very easily and have never come loose in the time we've had them...They just plain work as advertised!
B00171WXII|5|It gets all the snot out and helps clear the nasal passage for better breathing.I love it!
B0093LZLFG|3|BOBs double jogging stroller adapter only allows for 1 BOBs infanct car seat and 1 toddler, do not waist your money if you have twins.
B000FT7NVK|4|Bed was relatively easy to put together and seems solidly built. Of course only time will  tell if it will withstand the beating it will take. On initial appearances it appears a good  bargain for the money.
B003KQM9LY|5|These adorable little lady bugs were everything I had hoped for and more!  They made the perfect little touches for my daughters bedroom - they peek out from random spots and make her giggle.  Fast shipping, smooth transaction - wonderful product!
B00ALOT55Q|3|This is not very tall, we are using it for two small puppies and they are able to jump out. The door is hard to open and the panels are hard to adjust. Built a bit flimsy, but for a small child only crawling it might be ok.
B005DU1YW0|4|great it protects my baby from rain, snow, wind the only thing is that at first it smells a lot like plastic obiesly but after a week or so the smell will be gone.
B00PTL15D6|5|Was bought for babyshower and she loves it
B001NIFNTG|3|After reading other people's reviews on the Baby K'Tan, I had my heart set on having it and I really looked forward to its arrival. I needed a comfortable carrier that my baby could relax in, one that does more than my Baby Bjorn and has multiple wear positions.<br /><br />The Baby K'Tan is very soft and cozy looking, and I like that it is way compact and easy to tuck into a diaper bag. The only thing I'm not so keen on is the sizing. Since I'm petite (5'2\\", 110 lbs after losing baby weight), I ordered the XS size. It is indeed extra small, so tight in fact, that on the first wear, the fabric was cutting off the circulation to my baby's legs and they were turning dark red, then purple. Off went the Baby K'Tan! I've tried stretching it out but it's still too snug for my liking and I just worry too much about my baby while wearing it. She doesn't seem to mind it that much once she's in it, but she will start whimpering to get out after about 5 minutes.<br /><br />Its tight fit also makes it somewhat difficult to get the baby in by myself. It's easier if you have someone else there to hold up the baby while you arrange the fabric. I'm not sure if my experience is typical, or if I just have an overly large baby (3 months old, 15 pounds, full head control). I want to like the Baby K'Tan...but I think it is better suited for newborns or small babies who want to curl up in the fabric and sleep.<br /><br />The Baby K'Tan is extremely comfortable for me, but not my baby. Once it's on, it feels like your baby is a part of your body--no back or shoulder pain. I wish she fit in it better!<br /><br />I will keep the Baby K'Tan for my next kid, but for now, I'll stick to the Bjorn because my baby's legs fit in it better.
B004IZTBG2|2|I am decorating my nursery in a Beatrix Potter theme so this mobile was a perfect fit. The mobile is very cute and I plan to keep it, however the quality was much less than expected considering the high price. The mobile arrived flat in the packaging and does not hang in a circle because the circular frame part was folded flat in the package, so when you unfold the mobile the frame is bent into an oval shape. I am going to have to place something circular inside the frame of the mobile, which I'm hoping will straighten it out into a circle as the photo shows. Also, the fabric quality is just okay. For $65 I expected it to come out of the packaging in perfect condition, but I will have to do some work to it to make it hang nicely as the photo shows. Also, considering the high price, it would have been nice if the plastic arm of the mobile came with a fabric cover as some do. I am going to make my own fabric cover for it.
B005V09RN0|4|This petite chandelier is really cute, and very romantic. My husband was surprised at how much he liked it (and he was really concerned I was going to make our room too \\"girly\\"). I think this would be a great light for anyone wanting a slightly gothic, romantic, shabby chic, or even Moroccan look.<br /><br />I knew I wanted a chandelier in my bedroom, but my room is kind of small (approx. 10' x 15', with only an 8' ceiling) , so I was concerned about the size of this, and if it would hang down too low for comfort.  The light hangs down about (don't quote me on it) 16\\" from the top of the chandelier (not the cord/chain), to the bottom of the hanging glass beads).  The chain it came with was very long, although I didn't measure it since we didn't use it. Note: the chain is black, and surprisingly sturdy, with the electrical cord winding through it, but the grounding wire it comes with is silver and stands out a little bit.  The chain is also very basic and I thought it kind of clashed with the style of the chandelier. Not enough to be an eyesore, but enough that I was glad I didn't have to use much of it.<br /><br />I debated between the three or four bulb chandelier of similar styles.  I'm glad I went with this one, since it's bright, but not as bright as a standard overhead light.  Any less bright and it would not be practical.  Anyhow, hubby hardwired the light (which was pretty easy and came with directions, so anyone with basic electrical knowledge should feel comfortable doing this).  Bulbs came with the light too (4 bulbs at 25 watts each), which was convenient.  In the manual, there were directions and sizing info on if you want to add shades to the bulbs. I chose not to, since I think the shades would look odd with the style of this chandelier.<br /><br />It also comes with a very small (approx. 6\\") ceiling plate, so unless you replaced a light with an equally small ceiling plate/medallion, either get a medallion to accompany the chandelier, or be prepared to do some patching/painting.<br /><br />The light is packaged very well, and everything was in good condition, except one of the hanging beads had 2-3 scratches on it - no big deal.  Before you hang it, its a good idea to go around the light and straighten all the beads so that they hang down consistently, or you will have beads and adornments hanging at weird angles.  The only thing I would have liked better, and the reason I gave it four starts instead of five, was that the beading that decorates the frame of the light is attached with black wire. All. over. the. place.  When it's night and you need to use the light, you can't really tell, but during the bright light of day, I can easily see the wire wrapping around all the decorative beads, and it's pretty small gage wire, but whomever made it used plenty.  I guess it's a good thing, since I doubt the beads will ever fall off.<br /><br />Overall, I'm really happy with this purchase.  It's a very pretty and cute chandelier!<br /><br />Note: this review is on the black version.do some patching/painting.<br /><br />The light is packaged very well, and everything was in good condition, except one of the hanging beads had 2-3 scratches on it - no big deal.

B001H0GF10|5|This ExerSaucer is amazing!! So far we've only used it as a bouncer. There is also a tummy time use and a stand and play station. My son loves to bounce in this! It has been so much fun to see him grow bigger and be able to interact with different parts of the toy. There are so many things for him to explore that he is happy in it for at least 30 minutes at a time if not longer. Really great for Mommy getting things done!
B008D4XEQW|2|Kid does not like it and it tore after a few uses.  Poor quality.
B00006S3RX|4|This is one of those cases where they've gone overboard with the improvements.  We have twins and borrowed an Ultrasaucer that is about 3 years old.  Our daughters loved it so much that we bought the new Ultrasaucer.  They really enjoy it, especially the the little round musical toy with the horn on top.  However, a few of the \\"improvements\\" they've made actually take away from the toy.   <br /> <br />The round drum with the beads that they spin is too small and the beads are way too light - they don't make much noise and are hard to see, so the girls ignore it; the tall mirror is too high; the rocking knight doesn't do much so they ignore that too.   <br /> <br />A few of the toys that they love on the older model were replaced.  There used to be a frog and a butterfly that rocked when they bounced.  They've been replaced by a plastic cover that lets them see the spring - there is no fun in that.  Also, there used to be a bar that had beads and a butterfly that they could spin which is now gone. <br /> <br />Finally, they tout the ability to fold the swing to travel with it, but there are a few problems with this.  1) It is very difficult to fold; 2) folding it only lowers it, the toys stay on and it is still the same width, so you wouldn't bring this anywhere; and most importantly 3) the hooks to secure it in the folded position face outward and are right at the height of a sitting baby's eyes - DO NOT let your child sit right next to it, if they fall on the plastic hooks (and there are three) they could get really hurt. <br /> <br />While I wish that they had left some of the toys from the older version, our daughters still love it and I probably would buy it again if given the choice.
B00AK1KN8I|5|great product
B007BI8GEQ|5|good
B002ITOC7S|5|This was a good product, even though I returned it, if I would have used it, it definitely would have been worth my money, anyone could hear the sound go off in the case of a baby to stop moving in his/her sleep.<br />I just wasn't the type of paranoid mother to need this product!! WORTH EVERY PENNY!
B003VNKLIY|5|Got it opened and set up so easy. Looks good. Nice and sturdy, very adjustable.
B0018ZVLCW|5|This product works well for its purpose. It allows you to quickly and effectively rinse your child's hair without getting a lot of soap or water in her or his face. Children also like to play with the cup during bath or pool times so it can serve double duty as a toy.
B00L36H8QE|4|This year the mosquito problem is pretty bad in my neighborhood. All my family got lots bites and we hardly do yard work. I got the mosquito repellent stickers discount in exchange for my honest review, and I was very excited to try them. The sticks can be re-applied several times and the glue doesn’t remain on cloth which I like a lot. One evening in our back yard without having the stickers I got four bites quickly, so I knew there were many mosquitoes there. I then applied a sticker on my right chest. I got a bite on my left arm 15 minutes later, and none on my right arm. I believe that the stick works well, somehow the range isn’t as 3 feet mention on the package, so you possibly need to use more stickers.
B0000CCOJM|4|My child was filled with anger and hate when it came to calming down and relaxing before bedtime. So my wife and I bought him one of these wonderful stations after seeing him enjoying himself  on it  at our  local daycare center. My wife put the piece together while I was toiling at my job and she said it was easy. The only thing that makes him want out of this structure is a urine-filled-harshly-soiled diaper. My child still screams, but now,  with joy --  not anger.
B003DQK4DG|3|The frame has a great wood look and finish, but is actually for a 3.5\\" x 5.5\\" photo opening.  The description is quite mis-leading.
B006C183LE|4|I bought this bag used from a second hand store so that probably is my problem but it lasted me at least six months. It is VERY cute and stylish and one I don't mind carrying. It had plenty of pockets and I GUESS it fit enough for two babies.. Although mine always seemed to be overflowing but it is a decent size. If I didn't pack so heavily it would have worked a bit better. It was just a bit too small for my needs.  My strap on the zipper on the front pocket broke and the strap broke and the metal ring that holds the strap on wasn't closed completely and I had to put a piece of duct tape on it to keep it from coming off... I would say I got my $8 worth (bought second hand..)<br />Overall really liked this bag though. Knowing what I know about its quality idk I would spend $50 on it.. but for the price I haven't seen many others that are this fashionable and not cutesie with winnie the pooh..
B007XL658K|4|I am not very good at swaddling my child with normal blankets, he would wiggle out of them too easily. The velcro is even a little softer then normal as to not hurt his skin if accidently exposed. These are great! Tight and even my 9lb nordic viking cannot wiggle free. Ahhhh sleep feels wonderful!
B0038HUR0A|4|I think it helps reducing my belly quickly, but it could be breastfeeding too, or maybe the help of both. But it certainly help me get back in shape. My baby is almost 6 month old now, and my belly is about 3\\" bigger than pre-pregnancy, and I don't do any exercise. I first use it as soon as I got home, but after one day of use, my previously very swollen feet (which seems less swollen at the hospital after birth) seems to get swollen again. So I stopped using it. I started using it again around 6 weeks postpartum, used for about 1 month, and then it's already too big to use. By 3 month postpartum, my waist was about 4-5\\" larger than pre-pregnancy.  But it's very difficult to wrap it as tight as possible on my own because of the velcro, so I usually ask my husband to put it on for me.   I also think it should be more contoured in shape instead of straight. Because it's not contoured, there's always a fold at the velcro. You can't wear it out because it'll be visible underneath.  I didn't go by the size chart recommended, went 1 size smaller, otherwise would've had to buy another one soon. At first I had to suck my belly in so that I could velcro the wrap, but after just a couple days of use, the belly already got much smaller..
B0009A4FBQ|4|Can I just say this: Do yourself a favor and don't purchase a diaper bin that requires special liners or bags. You'll save a ton of money by just using regular garbage bags.<br /><br />I've had two of these diaper pails (one couldn't fit during our move so we left it behind). I got the first as a baby shower gift and only used it for about 2 months, whereas the second one I've used for almost two years.<br /><br />The lid is designed to stay open when you push the button, but at this point we did something to mess up the mechanism and now it falls closed and won't stay up. Not a huge issue, but I could see how that could be a problem when you don't have a free hand while changing a particularly messy diaper.<br /><br />The smell is contained fairly well with this pail. After a few days, it does start to get stinky but hey, at that point it should be changed, right? I don't expect anything to contain the smell of dirty diapers for long periods of time, even a diaper pail.<br /><br />The lid has a little container built in to put the little arm and hammer scent diffusers. Our first pail came with them, the second did not. I didn't find them highly effective. I've heard people sprinkle baking soda at the bottom of the pail to diffuse the smell, I've never tried it or really needed it. I find the occasional spritz of Febreeze keeps everything smelling fresh.<br /><br />I would love if this item has a foot-lever for hands-free use. I'm sure there are others out there, but I didn't want to spend more money on a garbage can (and let's face it, anything associated with children doubles in price). Overall, this does the job and has never caused me any issues.
B007TJVYSM|5|I need to store small portions and these are perfect for it.  I can put them in the refrigerator or freezer and bring them out as needed.
B0096HSWMG|5|I have a variety of cups for my 1 year old in the cupboard. since lids keep breaking or a dog keeps chewing on the lids I've had to buy more cups. These cups are amazing! My son got once for his birthday which is what made me want to buy more of these kind of cups. They don't leak, my one year old can hold it, and they have great characters on them. They are by far my favorite cups for my son to use.
B0080D59Y6|5|Great highchair! I love how the cover is easy to take off and clean and it folds very easily as well for either easy storage or moving to another area! My son likes to turn around while eating and point to the colorful animals on the print. For the price you can't go wrong with this!
B000LY3W00|5|This is an amazing activity center which any child should enjoy. I bought a station for my 9mnth old baby. She loves it!!!!!
B006SFUD2G|4|Takes a while to get contents warm enough and then the bottle itself is too warm for my daughter to hold herself. But still so much better than other options in my opinion.
B005XJ2VGE|5|I love that this can do multiple heights, as well as works with them from being super small to toddlers.  The fact it comes with a booster seat too is a bonus because now I dont have to buy one if my son suddenly decides hes done with the chair.  Also having 3 trays that are stacked to eat off of make it easy to go from dinner to dessert without having to clean up all the previous mess immediately.
B00957YNJS|4|Was just what i was expecting. It's kinda cheaply made, but for the price it's not bad. Will hopefully do the job!
B00OVJHQR6|4|We bought this for our 20 months old girl to use in our camping trip. We couldn't find small enough sleeping bag for her so we decided to try this. We put her in layers (long sleeve onesie, long pant pajamas, then fleece pajamas, then this bag. When I put this one her, she fussed a bit b/c she couldn't move around it but soon, she fell asleep and was warm enough in the tent. It wasn't terribly cold outside so it worked. If it was colder, I was ready to put on another layer which is down jacket for her since the arms will be out.<br /><br />It's easy to put it on her and washes in the washing machine. I hang dry it though just in case. The bag is pretty big. She has a lot of room to grow using this bag. I think my 3 year old boy can fit in it too.
B00PY2RO9O|5|Works great .. What more to say?
B0035ER50Q|5|My wife and I will not use any other cup design except for these.Our 4 year old used nothing but this design from the time we discovered them until she stopped using sippy cups regularly (she still uses them on occasion). Our 2 year old has never used anything else.<br /><br />They are the best cup for leak protection in our experience. Others either didn't offer real spill protection at all, or would quickly lose their ability to prevent spills/leaks. Over time, the leak proteciton insert in these does decrease in effectivness, but it still only allows a slow drip, which is fine if you don't let your kids take their cups anywhere they want to (and leave them sitting on their side). They are dishwasher safe, and hold up great as long as you don't use soap that is overly abrasive. The harsh soap won't damage the cup or lid, but it will cause the designs to peel off of the cup.
B004OR1DTC|5|Grass is harder than expected but that is probably ideal for drying.  Excited to use it - it is so cute sitting on the counter, with a (sold separately) flower!
B0040GJ0UQ|5|It is easy to attach and the sound is fun and entertaining for the baby.  Very fun for the baby.
B00WANFS20|4|My granddaughter, age 3 loved this cute little pouches. Cute and cheerful design on front and  a clear back so you can immediately see the contents. Perfect for some crayons, stickers and even some coins for the piggy bank.  Reminded me of a pencil case but just a lot smaller. Fun item for toddlers.
B0013F6SCA|5|This is the only teething implement that both my kids have absolutely loved. They can get to their back teeth with it, unlike the teething rings where they can only really bite with their front teeth. Highly recommend.
B00KD5O26K|2|First off I couldn't wear it due to being plus size so my mom tried it on and it fit her so she put my 23 month old 26 pound daughter into it. It absolutely smashed her in she couldn't move her head side to side it was uncomfortable for both of them so I will be returning this product! I will say it wasn't to horrible for my 4 month old nephew.
B000GE1MEI|5|This item does the job it's meant to do and is pretty easy to remove and clean each week. No complaints here.
B00KN0TPNA|5|Love these inserts!
B003G2YUUU|5|I bought this for my baby specifically because it was a rhino, and it is really adorable. It was packaged well and arrived on time, and at my purchase time the price was cheaper than other &#34;big brand&#34; stores. The book has a great little mirror that my baby loves to stare at himself in, and the little toys hanging off of it are great for teething.
B0007YDCY0|5|Just the right size for in the crib or in the car.  The material is very cuddly.  If my son didn't like it, I would have take it.
B000M133D8|2|Does not allow for much air flow, best to not use on hot or humid days.
B001BLCII4|3|I like the way it looks and my son seem to enjoy his ride but it is a very hard to fold....
B000B4SVM4|1|We received this as a gift, and my daughter did not like at at all (at least she didn't seem \\"soothed\\" to me). The movement was way to slow to soothe her and was not smooth like rocking-- unlike swings, it doesn't work from momentum, so it seems jerky to me. It is heavy, hard to move, and loud. She much prefers her swing, and it actually takes up less space.
B00CXVLLSE|5|Softest blanket! Made very well!! Not to mention it's adorable
B000K53UEI|4|Bought product to save room on counter...which it did. I expected it to be slightly smaller though. I bought the white one but now I wish I had purchased the black. I use the rack to dry my pump parts and the white valves which are pretty small and white tend to disappear on the rack....just a note for anyone buying it in the future. Black would make it easier to see small parts like my valves. It would also ve nice if it turned more smoothly but for the price it's a good product.
B00078ZHPS|5|Very soft and fits great.
B007QSQHLA|5|I purchased this for our Grandson and he loves throwing it around and also kicking it.  The best thing about this ball is the lightness of it and he can hold it in his hands.
B001FGL9X0|5|wubbanubs make it so easy to find a paci! Both of my babies loved them!
B006ZVV0P2|4|This is good for keeping scuff marks and mud off your seats. My two complaints: the organizer baskets are floppy and somewhat useless, and the headrest strap could be a little bigger because it doesn't fit in my car well (I have TV screens in the headrests). Other than that, it's okay. I prefer the Brica mats even though they do not have organizers.
B004AHMCLY|5|Baby loves them
B00NVSAI82|5|Gorgeous and functional. I can carry my Pump In Style Advanced pump & parts, laptop, and wallet. Thank you so much!
B005537IFW|5|This doll is precious! I bought two for my twin cousins that were born in Feb. They are very soft & I think they will be a favorite to take along with them as they get older. I looked them over & didn't see anything a baby could get off & choke on. They are very well made. Makes a great gift.
B0042G8YCY|5|So cute! It is exactly what I wanted!
B003EIKXVQ|5|Great quality, very cute, great gift.<br />Good service.<br />Ordered for friend & the LOVED it!<br />Will get for other baby presents, or young chid.
B009EDSWJA|5|Our baby has always loved to lay on this pad for whatever reason.  When she was a fussy newborn I would let her lay on it and turn the shower fan on for white noise.  (She never slept on the pad or was left unattended) and she would calm down.  She loved to sleep on her back from the start, so convincing her to do tummy time was a little rough- until one day when she was a little over 1 mo I put her on her tummy on this pad.  I think because the material is soft and supportive, she felt really secure.  So with every diaper change (that is a LOT )  I  would give her some tummy time right afterwards, and she loved it!  She got very strong and stable quickly.  Now she is 6 mo and crawling, but I still use this pad daily for changing diapers.
B000HHYJQW|5|1.30.08 OK! I've been using it. Can I tell you that the Car Seat is only good for 3 month or so! Your better of buying Graco or the best selling travel systems that are out there.  I don't go out often and the little time the stroller has been in use, Well, it Sucks! The color is wonderful! Overall, not good.  Sorry for the late responds... Shop away!  ------------------------------------------------------    Still Not in Use!    I was a bit unease to purchase the travel system. The first review on here was well written and to the point of her problems.  I've searched for so many strollers, and many were dull colors. I want my son to be, to see color in his life, brighten up his space. NO MORE PASTELS!!!    Target had TS for $229 and I'm a bargain hunter, so hello Amazon has it for $145. Great deal! The design is great! Yes small cup holder, etc. Yet, work with what you have.  I loved reading Jenny McGrathy's Baby Laugh. She makes a good point \\"don't go crazy buying a $2,000 stroller if your baby could be happy with an $l00 one.\\" [[ASIN:052594883X Baby Laughs: The Naked Truth About the First Year of Mommyhood]]   She has the money to spend. I'm on a budget plan, and I didn't want to put my stroller on the baby registry. There are some things that parents should get.      Some discoloration can happen.  I'll tell you why, it's a light gray base, it can easy scratch and turn white.  Everything else was good. I had a little bit of a struggle when I was trying to open it. =)  Once you get the hang of it, it's easy.  Don't be afraid of the GREEN COLOR, it's not NEON!  Overall, I'm satisfied with my purchase, and I look at it everyday, I love it even more.  Everyone who sees it loves the color too.  Safety wise, it's good, nothing came broken; all the parts where put together right. It's surely light weight; the car seat has cushions all over. Test it out, if it doesn't work out for you return it and move on. Don't dwell on it.  Do your homework! Best of Luck with your shopping and go for it.    I'll be back in July, once I test it out!
B009GKSA7K|5|A Simple, Easy, Clean way to deal with every diaper change... Diaper One N Done says it all!<br /><br />No more diaper genies, no more odor concerns, portable, interchangeable from a table top to hanging on the side of changing table or crib.<br /><br />Great Idea for DAY CARE CENTERS or BABY SITTERS - gives the caregiver that peace of mind of spreading unwanted germs and odors.<br /><br />Price point fits most budgets -GREAT BABY SHOWER GIFT!
B00HI0Y0I8|4|This toy is soft and baby safe but the reflective surface is flexible which gives a warped look. Overall happy with the item and price and baby likes it.
B005UUSFQ6|4|This is a nice style item, it's made of good materials, good development. My wife founded a little difficult to use.
B006O7AALC|5|Very cute! Runs a little big though.
B0081ZOV06|3|I'll start by saying that this pacifier is very durable. I bought this particular one because it is all one piece of silicone - the material can be boiled to sanitize it, if you desire. With a nipple brush, there are no areas that are impossible to get to for cleaning. There are holes for a pacifier tether, as well.<br /><br />Now for what I didn't like: I suspect that the folks that make the Soothies designed this 3+ month version with durability for teething children in mind. It's thick and rugged and... way too stiff for our kid to get a good latch on. The material of the nipple is far less pliable than the 0-3 month variant, probably with the intention of preventing kids from biting a piece off, but this has completely prevented our little one from actually getting enough suction to keep the nipple in her mouth. She's given up trying to suck it, and has taken to using it as a chew toy instead. Fortunately, it's strong enough that I'm not worried about anything coming off, but the thickness of the material is also the product's weakness. I'll probably order the 0-3 month for the next kiddo, and hope that it's used for the intended purpose.
B000ME3146|4|I haven't used the pump yet, but I took a couple of pictures of the box.  If I can figure out how to add them, I will do so - there isn't an option when writing a standard review unless it's a video.  Since there are so many different styles of this pump out there, I wish someone would have posted these pics when I was deciding among the many versions of the pump.  I'm posting pictures taken directly from the box that this Ameda Purely Yours Carry All came in to help others see more detail on what they are buying.  I have not yet used the pump so I can't add anything to the reviews on that, but it definitely seems you need to pick between this one and the Medela Pump in Style.
B003UF6NVW|3|Take and Toss are great for being inexpensive, so if you lose it or need to throw it away you don't feel bad, but also a good functioning cup. They were a great first cup for our baby. The only complaint is that they are not spill proof as they label says. The cup will leak from the spout and if thrown on the ground, as you can expect will happen, the lid has completely popped off on several occasions. But babies throw things, spills happen and juice and milk will spill, no big deal. It's a good product for the price.
B0038OLMX4|5|I bought 2 of these. One at the top of the stairs and one at the bottom. The auto lock feature is really helpful so you dont have to manually lock it. The product is sturdy and the opening has enough room (for average individual) even when you are carrying your child.
B00I4BLYX4|2|They look nice and arrived fast but WON'T stick to the wall. I bought other wall decals that are staying on the wall just fine but these ones just won't stick!
B004K6LMXY|2|The comb is (obviously) not flexible so baby needs to have a significant amount of hair before it's useful.<br /><br />The bristles on the brush are shedding off so I don't use it often. I am not sure if this is temporary or not, so I would not purchase this again unfortunately.
B00KI02IRA|3|My original review is below but because my son was rolling over in his swaddle and wouldn't sleep with just PJ's I was forced to keep trying this sleep suit.  Finally, after a few nights, he slept 5 hours and then another 4.  Maybe it just takes some baby's a few days to get used to it.<br /><br />Original review: With so many great reviews I thought this was the answer to all our sleep problems.  After 5 nights of waking every 2 hours and breaking out of his swaddleme wrap I finally gave in and ordered this sleepsuit.  The first night we got it I washed it and couldn't use it because it took 3 dryer cycles for it to dry.  I had to turn it inside out for 2 of them.  By the time it was dry, baby was asleep.  It was also 80 degrees in his room because we didn't have the air conditioner on and I was worried he'd overheat.<br /><br /> I started using it yesterday for naps and he slept as long as normal.  I put him to bed and he was up every 2-2.5 hours.  I finally put him back in the swaddleme at 6am and he was up for the day at 8am.
B001RJSM0S|5|very cute for a women in the military
B002HIL3IG|4|I ordered this long ago and it's been my go to caddy .<br />It's perfect size for my hair and facial goodies .<br />Good quality too , I like the softness of the fabric, it's light too.
B005C3K8PW|3|I got this for my three year old for a long car trip. Turns out you can't use it in a car seat because it's too big and shoved her neck forward. It was cute so she refused to give it up. It has since joined her collection of stuffies and will probably be useful once she's out of the car seat.
B004071ZO4|5|Cousin loves it for her baby
B002G66L18|5|You got everything arranged in the nursery. The babies are safe. Then you realize that it took you so long the baby is now a toddler and is grabbing on to everything. What are you to do? How do you keep the pint size from pulling down the bookshelf on their adorable heads? Buy the anti-tip anchor.<br /><br />Pros: Good strap. It works.<br /><br />Cons: The crumby screws. Save them for another project.<br /><br />Verdict: Find a stud or mount a stud to the wall and the underside of the bookcase if it is made from cheap pressboard/particleboard. Afterwards attach it with some real heavier duty screws and not the ones that came with the strap.
B007R8XHM6|4|I love this seat & so does my 4 yr old! I have a bit of a sportier car w/leather seats, so I needed a seat that would not shift & slide. This car seat clicks easy into place....so absolutely no sliding, & looks like a race car seat. I only gave it 4 stars.The back of the seat is wobbly. Only when your transporting it to another vehicle, & my daughter has to push herself back for her head to fit between headrest. Other then that I'm satisfied!
B00D2JN87I|1|I paid how much for this?  It shushes?!  Noth much to it.  Returned..
B000096QQ5|5|I didn't even know that these existed until my son was born almost two months early and the nurses in the hospital introduced us to them. These bags make it super easy to sanitize all of my sons bottles and pacifiers. I highly recommend these!!
B004XYE0A0|5|I absolutely love the Oh Katy! diapers.  I am always skeptical of new diapers but I've been given different brands to try or if I see cloth diapers on sale I am willing to try other brands.  I found Oh Katy online and decided to give their diapers a shot.  I was very impressed with the diaper.  I've never had a leaking issue and these diapers are amazingly soft even after months of use.  They fit my daughter perfectly.  If I could change all my diapers to Oh Katy, I would!
B00CWN3JT2|5|Best thing ever! Helps her fall asleep when shes having difficulty, or gives her something to look at to keep her calm when I'm preparing a bottle.
B0009JB3A8|5|Soft and perfect color.
B0001WAOA8|5|Very nicely made. I haven't got to use this yet but feels very durable and I think this will do great to save my leather seats in my car.
B004HKK5TK|5|This mattress is firm and very nice. I think If I could sleep on it I would. Fits perfect in our DaVinci Rivington 4 in 1 Crib. Can't wait for my little one to get here to see her sleeping on it.
B0000A1O7P|5|This seat beats those cumbersome high-chairs any day!   With our first child we used one of the old-fashioned high-chairs that took-up way too much space, with our second child something in our already way to cluttered house had to change! The high-chair for example.  This handy clamp-on seat is easy to take apart, and stow away(it comes with a pouch), fully washable and the construction seems to be quite sturdy too.  I really liked that it fit on our table that has a 4 inch skirt (you might have a problem with skirts larger than that, or that are to far under the table).   Most importantly, our 6 month-old seems to like it too and gets to sit at the family dinner table with all of us.  I am very happy with this purchase!
B001CUPT76|5|The Jeep weather shield is great. Works for both my Mclaren and Micralite stroller! I love that there's a little pouch area where you can put your stuff in (wallet/small clutch) in the event it rains. It comes with a small black bag that you can store the shield when not in use or post-raining so that it doesn't drip water.
B00AHVR7YE|5|Perfect item! My daughter feels so excited to sit at the &#34;grown up table&#34; and eat dinner. She's 2 and loves to dine like the adults haha. Its also very portable when we go out to eat, she hates the high chairs at certain places and at others their booster seats do not have safety belts, so Im nervous she may slide under the table. But all in all this chair has two slots to place the back of the chair (if your child is short or tall) and it worked out great.
B00K6KW05M|4|Nice product, delivered as promised. Seller recommended !!!
B00648KZ9I|5|I bought two, one for each of my twins. Great purchase, we use it everyday! I wish I had bought this back when we first had introduced solids! I didn't purchase until they were about 10 months old. It does a great job at catching everything that misses their mouth, unlike the pocket bibs that we've used in the past. It will catch liquid too. I love that I can rinse it under the water to clean in between uses and throw it in the dishwasher at the end of the day. The only downside is that I have to be really careful when puting it on my daughter, her hair is pretty long and will get caught up in the closure if I'm not paying attention.
B008Y2DFLM|5|This is a really nice pillow. It's very soft and odorless. My baby loves it.
B00BFXR5L8|3|This set is really cute. The quality is overall really nice and the colors in the material are quite vibrant.<br /><br />There are two things that I was not really impressed with:<br /><br />1) The comforter is too square shaped and does not really fit into the crib very well<br />2) The diaper holder is really small
B0042FWN40|5|I think this is a great product. It does exactly what it's supposed to--keeps my 5 month old's head in one place while nursing. He is at the stage where he has trouble concentrating on nursing because so much else is going on around him. When I wear this necklace, he can focus on nursing more because the interesting ring is right in front of him.
B00NUQZPR4|5|Great size and very cute. Looks just like photo and description
B00EE1DKT4|5|Beautiful item. Delivered on time.
B00020L78M|4|Overall this product is as described and I am satisfied with the purchase.  The only flaw is if you use it to block something rather than using it as a playpen.  There is a small plastic knob at the bottom of each section that is used to connect them together, so when the gate is not connected it is sticking straight up in the air and a child could easily fall on it a get seriously hurt.
B0041RRZ1U|5|Still my favorite bag after my grandson is now almost 3! I double it as my purse & carry a few things for him when we go on big outings!
B00FDEJS38|2|I personally think this is kind of a joke.
B00KIF5VAQ|5|Great material- comfy on baby's skin and incredibly easy to wipe clean!
B008YKZOLI|5|This carrier is comfortable in the front carry and back carry positions. I have had both my 3 year old and my 7 month old on my back. I followed official Lillebaby instructions on YouTube for back carry. Very easy. My 3 year old did not want to get out. Comfortable for the wearer. I do wish the buckle between the shoulder blades slid up and down more freely.
B00CM56P2S|5|My favorite brand, easy to use. The inner cotton is the best, high absorbency
B00BMJPEFY|5|I read so many reviews before buying this monitor.  We have a split level home and my 2 year old is a floor above us.  I was worried about the range with this monitor.  Our home is 2400 sq ft and we 'live' in every sq foot.  We transitioned my son from crib to toddler bed and I was terrified with just a sound monitor.  We have two cameras installed in his room and I feel so much safer with this monitor.  I LOVE the VOX!  My son sleeps with a white noise machine and we've had to get used sleeping with it too.  With the vox on, we don't hear anything we don't need to hear.  The picture quality is better than I expected for the monitor's price in comparison to others.  I only wish I'd bought this sooner.  It's given me great peace of mind and you can't put a price tag on that.
B00KYTJ6M0|5|I bought the bag for my co-worker's baby shower.  That was the theme for her son's room and she loved it.
B004X8GJPA|4|It portable potty is a bit small (fine for storing in the car, but I have to help my daughter up so she doesn't knock it over), but it and the liners has saved us from accidents many times. And they've come in handy for friends who need a quick potty option for their kids too. Definitely worth having in your car for those times you can't get the kids to a toilet fast enough!
B000SNGR0Q|4|This item was a good value. It works well and I am pleased with it.
B002USE0Q0|5|I love the swaddle blankets by Aden + Anais, they are the best I've seen out there because the material is such high quality and very comfortable for baby.  They are more pricey, but I think they are worth it if you can keep your eye out for sales!
B004I2H2L6|5|I'm not sure why these little bowls are so appealing but they are.  We all enjoy playing with them in different ways, both with other toys and on their own.  From four months old until now my baby consistently reaches for these first when she is at her toy basket. She is beginning to put things in the bowls now at 9 months.  They stack easily because the surface is a little rough, and they colors are bright and beautiful!  Just the right size for little hands, and I don't worry when she puts them in her mouth because the stain is nontoxic.
B003M9IRFG|4|Despite what many reviewers have to say, this is very easy to set up.  The instructions are on the mattress pad.  I would not let my baby sleep or nap in this as the mattress pad is too thin.  But it's a great play area with adequate room to move around.  It's very light weight, so even though it does not have wheels, you can easily pick it up to move it.  It comes with a bag and folds down nicely. Great product, great price.  No smell of plastic!!!
B007C6EKQ0|5|Soft, thick, feels like very good quality.  Fits my standard crib mattress (52X27.5X6) well and I feel comfortable with how the elastic grips the mattress.  I haven't washed them yet, so I can't speak on if they shrink too much or not, but the quality seems very good, so I think they will be fine (especially since I don't plan to wash in hot water). UPDATE: they shrink a TINY bit but only after a lot of washes.  Quality holds up great! Love these sheets!
B00BLBLR1I|5|The best pump out there and amazing customer service :)
B005O1L770|5|For a fabric book the makers did a great job to safely add some moving and squeaking parts to this book.  My daughter, 6 months old, loves the car squeaker even though she has not mastered doing it herself.
B001U9OUYC|5|This pad does exactly what it's supposed to do.  Makes a good, comfortable place to change your child.  I also like that it secures to the dresser, so my toddler cannot pull her little brother off the dresser by yanking on the pad.  We haven't had any problems with smells or staining that others have complained about, but we always use a changing pad cover. Maybe that's the difference?
B001JTLEUQ|4|Good bottles, but they sort of feel a little lighter duty than the other Paytex bottles. It does the job.
B0000789TD|5|This mirror is so easy to install, works in ANY vehicle - I have used it in 5 different vehicles. The mirror is very large and this makes it easy to see your little one in the back seat. The remote is a great feature so you can turn the mirror and lights on or off at any time. I first purchased a smaller mirror with the suction cup attachment and it wouldn't stick at all to the window. My daughter also loves it and waits for us to turn it on when in her car seat. She is 3 months old.<BR>I highly reccommend this product it is well worth the price.
B004ECJWK4|5|I wish I would have discovered this 4 kids ago.  It's so easy and does no damage to your door or walls in order to use.  GREAT INVENTION.
B00CXVI3NA|5|Very cute in a little girls room! And the variety of colors within the valance makes it easy to match up with a variety of accessories!
B00IAEHFH4|5|I have a standard crib from IKEA and this mattress fits it, just so you know if you also have an IKEA crib. It's more firm by a lot than my soft mattress from IKEA. My daughter slept on it just like normal. No complaints. If you're looking for a mattress that will last for years it's probably worth the cost, you can tell it would last much longer than the cushion only mattresses.
B00009IMCK|5|My 5 mo. old son loves this toy! It's great as a teether ansd he has fun moving it into different shapes.
B0069MDTBU|4|This baby bag has every compartment that one would need. I love the size plus very supportive to the back. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.
B00881ECVQ|5|Very soft.
B0043MYTIA|5|Toy.
B002OOWAB2|5|This item is nice because it converts into six different ways. It is easy to assemble, Easy to convert and Easy to fold for portability or storage.  I like this product because I was able to use it with my daughter when she was born. I really like it because I did not have to buy different products that my daughter would grow out off and then have to sell them or give them away and this was the best product and the price was just right. It is very helpful for a newborn, it starts out as an infant seat or rocker with a low profile frame that can adjust and you can extend the frame by just a push of two buttons on the back.  Also, the toy bar can be detached and can swing away from baby or can be in front of the baby. It also has a calming vibration to soothe baby to sleep or to clam baby down.<br />As the baby grows you can easily adjust the profile frame, so baby can seat closer to toy bar and you can have it as a rocker or stationary seat (you can flip out the kickstands) and the fame extends so you can also be adjusted to higher position for rocker or stationary seat. Once your baby becomes a toddler you can extend the frame to higher position and use it like a rocker or stationary seat. All in all this baby chair,seat,and rocker is the best product out there and made from a highly recommended company named Fisher-Price. There's not a day that goes by that my little momma don't play with this chair. When I travel with my little momma, I love how easy it breaks down so I can side in this chair without taking up so much space inside my car trunk. So if your having a baby some time soon I say pick this up so you don't have to worry about the extra stuff you may need later because this knocks out three possible items you made need to buy separately. That's 3 in 1 your getting for a great low low price....
B00BNQEZY2|4|this is roomy and has cup holders! the only think I don't care for is, there is really not much padding except a thin cover. Also, the latch connectors are overlapping hooks (like a spring clip) instead of the seat belt style clips with a push button release that you find in some of the higher end car seats.
B00AMVMNCU|5|Why purchase the real thing for more when you can get the real thing for less?  Pieces fit my pump in style perfectly.  I pump twice a day and the parts are still going strong.  Get this instead of the name brand.
B0078A8HH8|4|We got this for my baby's first birthday and he was SO excited by it - so were his dad and big brother. My only problem with it is that the pieces seem to disappear and so he can't play with it all at the same time very much - but that's probably mostly our fault. We all love playing with it when we can find all the pieces - even the new 1 year old.
B00RYJHKXK|5|I love these diapers. They are fully adjustable and very well made. They wash easily and for my daughter well. The prints are cute and fun, too.
B0039ONKFQ|5|Super simple to install, less than 5 minute job. It is really easy to break into a sliding door, without breaking the glass. This lock prevents that. Highly recommended. Peace of mind for less than $30.
B000PRUAFI|1|The gate came bent ever so slightly, but enough that it could not close.  Wish I had figured that out before I installed the thing.  Of course, Amazon refunded my money easily.
B00DS2U2Y6|5|This package is totally worthy. The high quality of Britax with a great price has not comparison. You are secure and safe with Britax.
B004919TO4|4|as the mother of a baby who loves to be carried but only if it's face OUT i was worried i would be cursed to carry her in our regular bjorn forever.  the regular bjorn is great and easy for tiny babies, but now that my peanut is pushing 14 lbs it's just ROUGH on the back.  most of the ergonomic carriers are nonos for us since she hates facing in.  this was really my only option so i crossed my fingers and grabbed one.  so far after our first test run i'm totally sold.  i can't believe the difference that hip band makes.  i barely felt her weight.  when you're wearing the regular bjorn you have to force yourself to stand up straight otherwise you hunch a lot, in this one you can hold yourself and the baby comfortably and very securely.  once you secure it the first time you can get it on and off pretty quickly (i'd say under a minute start to finish, beat THAT silly wrap thingies).  the kid seems to love it, too.  i deny one star because even folded down the face out option comes up a wee bit high on her, so it would be nice if you could adjust for length a little like on the original.  it would also be nice if you could could zip off the in facing butt flap entirely so it's not just flapping around when you're not using it.  the waist band straps are kind of difficult to adjust once the kid is in, so make sure those are snug before you position the kid.  you also need a partner to adjust the midback support, but you only really have to do that once so no biggie.
B000BU4C9Y|5|I really love this product is so easy to use and it stay so clean too!!!  I really recommended to anyone !
B001W98104|5|My granddaughter has several of these, and she loves them, especially at nap and bedtime. I bought one to keep at my house...just in case. I've never met a child who did not love these little blankies. They are a small, washable, durable version of a security blanket. Very soft.
B00A5AWV48|5|I enjoy taking my grandson for walks even more due to the ease of using this stroller. When the wind picls up I simply attach the wind gaurd.  I am looking forward to using it more as the weather gets nicer.<br />Michigan Grammie
B00NLJAU5C|5|Nice!
B00004SYNQ|5|My son is 21 months old and says only 2 to 3 words.  After receiving Toots the Train he has progressed to now saying &quot;Go&quot; and &quot;Stop&quot;.  He received the toy for Christmas and plays with it every day several times throughout the day.  It is simple enough that he can make it stop and go.  He enjoys putting items in it's path and watches the train push it along.  It keeps my son busy and entertained while I am preparing meals.  Highly recommended!
B000TGGDIS|5|I bought it before my trip knowing I would go from one place to the next, visiting my family and I am so glad I did.  My little 7 months old ate in every chair of every place we stayed at without any problem.  It's very easy to set up, to use, to pack, etc.  Love it!
B00AQ2R46A|2|This is the second Britax we've had.  We had a Roundabout and LOVED it.  Unfortunately, we had to purchase a new car seat because my car was rear-ended at a red light in September.  After confirming with her pediatrician that a car seat was still the best option for my daughter (as opposed to a booster seat), I decided to get a newer Britax model, since the Roundabout only went up to 40 or 55 lbs (depending on the model) and my daughter is aged 3 1/2, 42 inches tall and 38.5 lbs.<br /><br />I HATE this seat and wish I could turn the clock back to get a different one.  It is incredibly hard to get her in and out of and to buckle and unbuckle her (regardless of what she is wearing, i.e. shorts set vs. winter coat) because of the short length of the harness straps- I don't see how she will make it to 70 lbs in this car seat.  I thought at first that maybe we had received a defective one because the straps were so short and hardly adjustable on her.  However, I viewed the model at Babies R Us, and it had straps that were just as short.  I even asked the sales clerk to demonstrate the loosening of the harness strap, even though I had already owned a Britax for 3+ years and I read the manual from cover to cover.  He had the same experience we did- he could barely get her arms through the straps without her crying that it hurt and he could not buckle her in (she was wearing a lightweight dress).<br /><br />In addition, we cannot find a cup holder that fits for this seat, including the one that Britax makes.<br /><br />I absolutely hate getting her in and out of this car seat every day.  I spent a lot of money on a product that is close to useless for us- we will have to replace this in the next few months with the next growth spurt.  I am sick about the idea of spending another few hundred dollars to get a new car seat, but she will not physically fit into this seat with another growth spurt.<br /><br />It may be safe and work for smaller kids, but for older or bigger oneslike my daughter, it is an absolute nightmare.
B002FB7FBE|5|Great diaper covers; they stand up well to washing (even with bleach).  The velcro strips are thick and will last a long time.  I use them for my 15 month old toddler.  He weighs 23 pounds and I use the second biggest buttons.  They fit great and will last until he's diaper free at roughly 2 years old.  I used the older style Thirsties with my older 2 sons, and these are a huge improvement, with thicker velcro and adjustable size.  I definitely recommend for traditional style tri-fold cloth diapers.
B00K6ZQWKQ|5|Excelent
B0070U6RAA|5|Great price for this. It is just what I wanted just wish it had a handle like on the other NUKs.
B000056J23|4|is easy to put and remove, is pretty strong and fits in your purse for when not using it perfect for twins
B000FT9IZY|5|My baby just loves this crib.  I bought a second one for my mother-in-law's house.  What a great buy.  Fits perfectly in our small houses.
B000WYEOZ6|5|very nice product it does keep sun out im very happy
B000OS8BP4|5|As a pediatrician and a mother of three, I am always looking for ways to help my kids.  I find the nose frida aspirator to be the most efficient aspirator out there.  I am reminded daily how fluid and bacteria in the nose can lead to complications such as ear infectons and sinusitis.  The best treatment and prevention is adequate suctioning.  I find the nose frida to work alot better than the typical bulb suction. It is easier to use, less irritating and yields better results. My parents are happy and so am I. I highly recommend and endorse this product without any reservation at all.   Dr Fernandez, Miami, Fl.
B00EYU1JA2|3|My child loves it and loves that he can stick his hands in the &#34;wings&#34;. It's a good soft towel. However, I was really hoping it would be longer (I know the sizes are listed, but it's hard to know what that will mean--I wasn't sure if the length was including the hood or not, etc). It's certainly bigger than the baby towels, but he's going to outgrow it soon. He's 3'2&#34;
B002FQKB2Y|5|purchased 2 of these.  The 2 nets were for stuffed animals in my kids rooms which work really well and 1 chain for my sons baseball hats and the other I put in my kitchen to hang my aprons and my kids lunch boxes on to get them off of my counter.  It's not the most beautiful thing to look at but it's easy to remove to put away if guests are over I actually have started clipping chip bags to it as well (limited on cabinet and counter space in my kitchen so it works really well for little things like that)
B00J0YSFZ4|5|Love it!
B002DND57M|3|For some reason my buy couple of month later still don't get used to it ..  he just prefer other ones, it can be just a matter of personal preference.  Item itself it's good quality, and it looks good ( I like it :D )
B00GGPJ4LO|5|The birds worked great, ended up being the favorite of my grand son!
B000HEBA12|5|We were on the hunt for the perfect product to help hold up our daughter's head while in her car seat.  Even though she has great head control and is sitting up, etc, on longer car trips and esp when she falls asleep in her car seat, she needed something to prevent her head from flopping over and the straps from digging into her neck.  These strap covers provide the perfect level of comfort and support without being too bulky (I think the pic makes them look bigger than they actually are). These picky parents give this product an A+.
B00005V6C8|4|Okay... Lid broke early on. I like the ubi way better!! I use for cloth.
B004044LD4|5|I was very hesitant about this purchase. The mattresses at Buy Buy Baby and Babies R Us are so much more expensive, and I assumed they might work better.  I was concerned that the baby would be uncomfortable with this mattress. At first touch it is not very plush. My 9 month old has been in the crib for almost 3 months and she doesn't seem to have any issues with is. She slept with us for months and our mattress is very plush. I didn't think she would like the crib mattress but after 4 nights of dreadful sleep training it was all good. We do have a mattress cover on top of it [[ASIN:B001KZH69C American Baby Company Organic Waterproof Quilted Crib Mattress Pad Cover]]. So far this item has really worked out for us. I am so glad we didn't spend more money.<br /><br />Pros<br />+ The baby sleeps through the night<br />+ Very good price<br />+ Easy to install<br />+ Arrived timely<br /><br />Cons<br />- Not as plush as other mattresses but that doesn't seem to matter to my baby
B003TSDMH8|5|My daughter loves this!!! it makes feeding her much easier because her spine remains straight, which I'm sure helps her digestion,  and I'm not straining my back and shoulders either. She loves sleeping on it after a feed.
B0081S5SFA|2|I have been a huge fan of Bilz for a number of years---have used the mazes for years until one finally broke. This pinball style was frustrating and nearly impossible to accomplish.  It's one thing to be challenging, but after a while it takes the fun out of the gift.  I had hoped to give them a different challenge, but it turned out to be a disappointment.  Sorry.  but--I will keep on the lookout for new Bilz products!
B00A0FGPFO|5|Fits tommee tippee bottles.<br />Auto off feature - which should come with any bottle warmer.<br />Small but efficient.<br />By far the best bottle warmer I have seen on the market for that price.
B0000BX8M8|5|I just bought this sterilizer and I think it's great. It doesn't take too long and it's VERY easy to use. The only problem is that I really don't like cleaning it. That part sucks but other than that it's great.
B000BK8RL8|5|I bought this when it was offered at a steal price and very happy with the product n quality.
B00EOTV6XI|3|they leak
B001H9NXCA|3|It's a kids toy and my niece enjoyed it because it was just that a toy, but it didn't suction well so of course it was thrown everywhere.
B004U5FQJ6|5|I love it the lunch bag, so cute! My daughter choose the Fox because She really likes Foxes!<br />So do we
B0000798KU|5|We have the Summer Monitor Camera and love it.  The picture is so clear that we can actually see our daughter's chest moving up and down and if her eyes are open or closed, when her room is pitch black.  If I didn't have this monitor, I would be walking in her room all night long, but instead, I just have to look at her while I am lying in bed, without getting up, or possibly waking her up.  We have now been using it for 6 months and could not be happier.  We haven't had any issues regarding clarity, range, or static.
B00LK5J73U|1|Not happy with this.  It broke after just 8 weeks of having it in the car.  Thankfully it broke while my baby wasn't with me so it didn't fall on him!
B004KAAUMO|4|This product was delivered on time, and was in the condition as described.  This plate was bought along with a bowl for my niece's baby.  She loved the bright colors and the cute faces of the animals.  The only downside == expensive.  The product is overpriced.  As an aunt, I couldn't resist and was satisfied.  It's adorable.
B0097OATP6|5|This hamper exceeded my expectations. It is made well and is a nice orange color<br />that goes perfectly in our babies nursery.
B0015GO6SK|5|Just buy these if you have tables and a little one learning to walk.  It saves both the edges of your table and lots of crying from the little ones.  This one is priced well and worth every penny.
B006W79MAY|2|Not real happy with purchase because it does not stick as well to tray up as I would have liked it to.
B008ED1XJ2|5|These are really great cabinet locks. They are really easy to get on and off (unlike many other models which can take 30+ seconds each time); these are off in about 1 second and back on in about 4. Being easy they arent the most secure (my 4 year old can open them after trying a lot but not my 2 year old),
B0028J2EQY|4|I love it probably more than my baby.  He likes it sometimes, but he's not a pacifier dude really.  It is smaller than I pictured, so he cannot manipulate it as well as I wanted him to.  This washes well and air dries quickly.
B000BVKPO4|5|I LOVE this thing!  It holds a lot more than you'd think & whether your bottle feeding or breast feeding, you need to constantly sterilize something.  This is so much easier than running the dishwasher.  I bottlefed & after each feeding I'd wash the bottles out then put them in this - once it was full, it takes 5 mins & everything is squeaky-clean!  Takes up about the same amount of space on your counter as a large toaster & totally worth it.  In addition to bottles & all the accessories, we used this to sterilize pacifiers, teething rings and almost anything plastic that my son was putting in his mouth.  It worked out great & I would buy again & again
B001EX81ZI|5|Fits nicely with the bottles/caps with no leaking even after I accidentally dropped one.  Just make sure the seal is seated properly and there are no problems.
B00G34TJZ4|5|Looks very strong, durable, looks like it will last a long time. Top quality.
B00HY0P82E|4|I love the colors of this bag.  And every pocket on it was nice sized except the the bottle pockets, they were too small for me to get a sippy cup in and that's what I would be putting in them.  I guess you could use the front zip pockets for sippy cups but I decided to just return it.
B0035RQF8G|5|They definitely work.
B009ICN71K|5|My 5 month old LOVES this teether more than the others we have.  And you can't beat the price!!!  I bought extras for around the house and to take to daycare.  I throw them in the dishwasher and haven't had a problem.
B000IDSLOG|5|Gave this to my sister and my best friend when they had babies.  Instantly turns into the favorite toy.  Will buy again.
B00014PLAO|1|We followed directions to the T, and within 8 hours after putting the baby in the crib, it started coming off.  Horrible product, However, it did get to us when it was supposed to.
B00MHDOEDC|5|Order was what was expected.
B001RQGAQY|5|I was very satisfied with the crib skirt I purchased.  It was exactly as I had pictured it to be and was the perfect size and color.
B006PB2C8G|5|I bought this for my grandson.  It is so easy to use and move in and out of other vehicles.
B000OQI8NG|4|Very cute and good quality. My 5 month old gets very fussy in the car, especially if it's dark out. So, the combination of music and flashing lights are just enough to keep him entertained! The song is &#34;You Are My Sunshine&#34; - a song I sing to him before nap/bedtime. So, that's a bonus!
B005PBPMKW|5|excelente
B005BTPDD4|5|Very nice!
B001KZJY2O|3|The cover is silky, so my daughter (15 mo) loves the feeling; but, she slides off when she lays her head down. Reason being, is b/c it's WAAAY too overstuffed. After I opened up the seam and took practically half of the stuffing out, it was fine. She will occ lay her head on it, but prefers the flat, regular sized pillow (cotton pillow slip) I in her crib. She doesn't roll off that one. She initially will lay head on it when gong to sleep but ends up on the regular pillow & holding the silky one. In summary, is it practical for every day use? No, not hardly. Had I not had to spend time &#34;unstuffing&#34;, it to make it flatter for her, then it would have been perfect for daily use.<br /><br />It has made for a pretty keepsake of my daughter’s “baby-hood” & sure to find its way to &#34;McKinley's Memory Box&#34;.  Having it monogrammed (locally for $10), added the perfect touch! It's also a great gift idea for baby's 1st birthday. However, if you don’t like a big hard “poof mound”, then plan on spending about an hour opening the seam, taking out stuffing & sewing it back up.<br /><br />NOTE: BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN LETTING BABY HAVE HIS OR HER OWN 1st PILLOW!  PILLOWS ARE NOT AT ALL RECOMMENDED FOR BABIES!  HUNDREDS of babies DIE EVERY YEAR b/c their loving, well-intentioned parents were merely trying to make their little one comfy. However, these parents simply weren’t' aware that babies (early toddlers) can easily smother from a single pillow!  TALK TO YOUR PEDIATRICIAN TO SEE IF YOUR BABY IS READY TO HAVE THE PILLOW.<br /><br />I'm an Emergency Room Registered Nurse and see these horrible tragedies all the time. I spoke with my pediatrician 1st. EVEN WITH HIS “OK”, I let her try the pillow at nap times (TWENTY times) while I HAD TIME TO “WATCH” HER SLEEP THE ENTIRE NAP. THIS WAY I MADE SURE SHE WAS SAFE WITH IT. ALTHOUGH SHE IS PERFECTLY FINE WITH A PILLOW, IF IT'S NIGHT SHES VERY SLEEPY, I DONT GIVE IT TO HER!  BABIES/TODDLERS SLEEP TOO SOUNDLY. THEY BURY THERI HEADS IN IT & DONT WAKE UP WHEN THEY CAN’T BREATHE!!<br /><br />SAFETY FIRST SAFETY FIRST  SAFETY FIRST SAFETY FIRST SAFETY FIRST SAFETY FIRST SAFETY FIRST SAFETY FIRST SAFETY FIRST SAFETY FIRST !!!!
B000U5FOT2|5|Great investment!! It's SUPER versatile, you can add to it, shorten it, etc. You can set it up in a line or shapes like a hexagon. This is probably one of my best purchases on Amazon
B0009ET93G|5|My 19 month old girl loves this cup. If you have any problem cleaning the straw use Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Cleaning Brush and problem resolve. This is the best cup for a toddler that will help the transition to a normal cup.
B00AJSJE6O|3|When we first put this together for my son, he started on the tallest setting. But our son is in the 99th percentile for height.<br /><br />Better than average noise makers. I'm not crazy about the fact that it is too easy to take the play things off the top. His 3yo brother likes to take them off. My 7 month old is also able to pull off the dragonfly and parrot out of their designated holes. A couple of times this has upset him as the toy has gotten stuck in the seat portion of the exersaucer with him.<br /><br />Additional information now that my son is starting to cruise: I changed the set up to the s-shape design. It is a little tipsy and I would recommend waiting until your little one is pretty steady before making the transition. It is not stable enough for a new cruiser.<br /><br />As a result of the above drawbacks, I have lowered my rating to 3 stars. (they don't have 3.5 as option)
B003NGI122|5|This car seat is wonderful.  It is made of quality material and the price is great.<br />We recommend it to anyone who is looking for economy and quality.<br />The colors are great for both girl or boy.
B001O9KIX0|2|I should have read these reviews before buying 6 of these.  My son could not suck on these nipples, they are really HARD.  It's peculiar that the other posters have commented on them being fragile...  In any event the nipples are BAD.
B004IZWQYQ|5|My 6 month olds love this!!
B000OS3AP0|5|Totally use this with our 2011 BOB (older style) and a chicco keyfit 30. Shhhh, don't tell, since I guess you're not supposed to use this with the chicco. TOTALLY solid and works, though, no problems in 7 months of almost daily use.
B000Y8ZCDI|5|This little blanket has made my grandson very happy. He carries it with him all the time and treats it like a person. He is 12 months old and calls the blanket Silky Bear. The lining on the back and on the side has a silky feel and he hugs the blanket while going to sleep. The blanket is precious and a good friend to him.
B004S2E00C|5|I love these plates! Very sturdy, good size and they wash well in the dishwasher. I purchased more from this product line.
B002WN2740|1|I just received this item today and was very surprised by the way the cotton feels.  In a word - terrible.  It feels very cheap like the sheets they'd use on hospital beds.  I'm sending it back and forking over the extra money for something higher quality.
B00FM5IWRG|5|For the price it is very good. No need to spend $150 for a more expensive one. Seems sturdy and easy to clean
B0042D69UQ|5|we registered and received a fancy bouncy chair for our shower. our son liked it but it is quite large and tough to carry up and down the stairs every day. we ended up buying this bouncer to keep downstairs as it was reasonably priced and had high reviews. Turns out our son loves this bouncy chair more than the higher priced one. it's also very easy to take apart and put back together so we took it with us on vacation and it only took 5 minutes to put together. our son loves the vibrating and also \\"talks\\" to his friends in his baby chatter. good price, good product.
B00EU5AL8W|4|Bought this item to observe my elderly father that has dementia and is prone to walking around in the middle of the night.
B007LXMPSE|5|Love this animal! Looks just like picture. Matches my bedding. Great size and made durable. Price was a little high for a stuffed animal but it was too cute
B0084CDKU8|5|I was looking at more expensive options for a stroller blanket and decided to try this one out even though there weren't many reviews. I am SO happy that I saved the money because this blanket rocks! It is plush, but not super heavy. It fits our City Mini GT perfectly! The fact that it velcros at the feet sets this a part from others I looked at. It will always stay on our daughter even if she tries to kick it off or the wind blows! I also plan on attaching this to our mei tai carrier and future child's infant car seat. The radiant heart pattern is gender neutral and is quite stylish, although I wish the Velcro were black so it didn't stand out as much. Note to Bumkins, make more patterns! If this came in a chevron pattern, I bet you would triple your sales! All in all, great product. Soft, secure, warm, affordable!
B0000ASU29|4|This is a quality set.  The longer mallet shafts help a lot if your tall.  Not that durable of a mallet head, dented up quickly.  Looks very nice, great rolling case and wickets.
B0000DF17Z|4|These are very cute and soft. I wish the nail didn't show when they are hung, but I can deal. (^_^)
B00BDCNPCY|5|Bought it for my granddaughter who came to visit.  My daughter already had the similar unit and requested the 65 DLX as to the reports and research she did. Of course after looking at the seat, we can see why it is highly recommended.  The child will be well protected in her seat.
B004I110D8|5|Why didn't we find you sooner?!?! I exclusively pump and bottle feed my son. So any car ride would involve finding a dunkin donuts and buying a large tea just so I could have a cup with hot water in it to warm a bottle. We were about to embark on a 22 hour car ride and I needed something on hand. I read all the reviews about the ones you plug into the cigarette lighter--all came with terrible reviews so I went with this one. I gave this a test run and water stayed HOT for 10 hours plus. They are also leak proof-no spills!! Will use for the rest of our lives.
B0077J2KB4|5|With my 1st child I bought almost 5 different strollers and was never happy with any of them.  With our 2nd I bought the Vista 2011 and it has been the only stroller we have needed. My daughter never was a fan of the bassinet. We used our Graco infant carseat with the Graco attachment when she was young.  I love how large the canopy is.  Sun in her eyes is never a problem.  The large basket is wonderful. I can fit my diaper bag and anything else we need for the day in there no problem. It is nice that the rain shield and bug net zip right on.  When we were caught in a rain storm my daughter was the driest one of the bunch.  They stay put and don't blow away like others I have had.  The stroller sits higher so there are times when I will just push the stroller up to the table instead of using a highchair.  The fabric washes up great.  We have used this on gravel, dirt, grass it travels well.  I love my uppababy vista.  My baby is 18 months old and I haven't even had the desire to look at other strollers.  Which for me is a big deal. :)  Customer service has been great.  We were flying and our stroller was in the Uppababy travel safe bag.  Our seat would no longer attach to the frame.  They sent us a new seat frame right away. I have the jolly jumper parent organizer, the uppababy snack tray, the uppababy ganoosh foot muff to go with my stroller. By only buying this one stroller I believe I saved money by not buying several cheaper ones.  I love my Uppababy Vista 2011 and would recommend this to a friend and you!
B00BR0OMF6|5|Great seat. My granddaughter can buckle herself into this although the seatbelt does sometimes get tangled. We have a Toyota Sienna mini van with bucket seats in the second row. The chair fits the seat very well and anchors securely. My granddaughter loves the fact that she can recline the bucket seat and her booster seat will recline again. I would recommend this seat. Got it on sale thru Amazon so it was very affordable too. Now my daughter and son-in-law want one for their vehicles too.
B004BJ0T52|4|The gates are great. We got a set of these. The 39&#34; comes with a metal 5&#34; cover that goes over the seam where two gates meet. The cover is a great idea. The package was missing a specific and special designed screw set to keep the cover secure to the gate. I called the customer service number provided. They directed me to e-mail the manufacturer, I did, twice. No response, twice.
B00CM8OZ6I|5|perfect set
B000JFHIPG|5|Tried other potties and this one is the only one my 2 year old son will use. He asks to use it all the time! He loves how easy it is to take the collector bowl out to help empty contents into the big toilet and flush away. I didn't need to do anything to entice him to use it except put it together and place it in the bathroom and he immediately came up and sat on it. He loves that it looks like the big toilet with a lid and toilet roll holder. Great product! Just bought a 2nd one for the downstairs bathroom.
B00B7ULJQQ|5|I love how this operates... for me i feel this has a great seal so i don't sense any smell
B00004D3ES|2|My baby's toes get stuck in the holes in the area that folds up.  It is not comfortable.  I always put a foam bath mat in the tub to make it more comfortable.
B00C6N27P0|5|Works great love it! Provides the proper amount of cushion to get prevent and hard contact with the head
B00FWUT996|5|Absolutely love it!! My daughter is 11 months old ...weighs 20 pounds and fits perfectly...wished I would of purchased this when she was a couple of months younger...but...overall it's beautifully made...and...so soft
B005WHQKDW|5|Great car seat. My son loves it!
B001D3G3R2|2|I was so unhappy with this purchase that I almost considered returning it. If it wasn't such a hassle, I would have.<br /><br />First of all, it was much bigger than I had imagined so it didn't serve the purpose for which I had planned on using it for. I assumed that it would be small enough to tote around to the grocery store, etc. b/c my carseat is one of those 3 in 1 models that isn't able to be continuously removed from the vehicle. Way too big to fit in a grocery cart and barely even fits into the front seat of my Toyota Corolla.<br /><br />Second of all, my daughter hates sleeping in it. We took it to a hotel for an overnight stay and she didn't sleep the entire night. The mattress is very thin and it didn't seem like she was very comfortable in it.<br /><br />Furthermore, I had assumed that it would be of some use in the future (which is why I spent the extra money) for her to use with her dolls or something but it is so large that isn't feasible either.<br /><br />Overall, pretty unhappy with this product...
B009M8P2CW|5|purchased this for a friend of mine.. they havent used it yet.. but shipping was extremely fast and the item looks great.. im pretty sure there wont be any issues.
B004DC9TAS|1|In order to recline the back you need to loosen two seat belt like straps.  In order to sit the back in a more upright position, you need to pull on those sturdy looking straps.  I've only done this a few times in the five months I've used this stroller with my now 12 month old.  I went to lower the back yesterday and noticed one of the straps was worn down to a thread.  The back of the stroller now sits slanted.  Customer service wants to send me a new strap, but I told them the strap is sewn into the back of the seat.  They deny this and had me send them pictures.  I have not heard back yet.
B000I1Q59G|5|My five month old says:<br /><br />&#34;This is pretty much the greatest thing you can stuff in your face.  There are rings for the feet.  Rings!  And it has, like, a gazillion different textures!  And it makes noise!  I could eat this thing all day long.  I totally love crinkle bear.&#34;
B00006783A|5|I really like this product.  If I had kids this would be a nice thing to have.
B00CWN3FRI|5|Excelente
B00HLVV7OO|5|a huge finger saver
B00NQR7EOE|5|Love this stroller it has made daycare life much easier for me!!  It is hard to steer at times but it is to be expected with 4 small children in. I am able to walk without the worry of children running in street!
B001KXZVEG|5|This is called a dinosaur towel, but my baby son's nursery theme is dragons and this really looks like a dragon! It's so adorable! We had it on our baby registry and were so disappointed when no one bought it for us that we bought it ourselves. Of course, it's maybe a bit expensive for just one towel but so cute that we couldn't resist.<br /><br />It's only about as soft as a medium-quality terrycloth towel for adults, but the baby doesn't seem to have a problem with it. It has washed up really well, too, even after he pooped on it a couple of times.  Sometimes it's nice to have something that just makes you smile when you use it, and this will.
B002IK4KLA|3|Even with the measurements given, these are smaller than I expected them to be. And they are not too soft either. Plus quite thin.<br />I was given some receiving blankets as a gift when I had my daughter, that I like SO much better. The only problem is they are pink and purple, so now that I had a son second, I cannot use them... I was trying to find some I would like just as much, but I'll have to keep looking b/c these are not it!<br />Expected a less cheap quality from Carter's brand :P
B004OR1DTC|4|I love this drying rack! I use it for all my breast pump parts that I'm constantly washing. It's also great for bottles, nipples and anything else you can think of. The only drawback is the price, it is a bit expensive for a drying rack.
B004N3C2RO|5|I came across the MoBoleez while surfing the net and thought this was a delightfully innovative way to give Mums the privacy they need to breastfeed when out and about. The MoBoleez hat is the brainchild of Canadian business woman and breastfeeding mum Diane Sam. The `stay on head sideways' design means that when the hat is on, it stays on - no more fussing with dropping blankets or awkward, bulky 'nursing covers'. The big brim gives mum a little privacy, but doesn't hide breastfeeding, it celebrates it in a fun sort of way! The MoBoleez breastfeeding hat comes in a multitude of designs to suit all tastes and occasions.I wish these had been around when I had my children (not that I felt the need to cover up while feeding) especially when they were slightly older and getting inquisitive.<br />Sharon Trotter<br />Founder and Director of TIPS Ltd, UK<br />[...]
B002RL7UWQ|5|It works perfectly! It also include batteries! incredible!
B00JCBD5JQ|2|Our crib had a string smell for almost 3 weeks. We washed it with baking soda and water several times as well as vinegar and water. We vented the room with fans and the window open. We also bought a plant to purify the room smell.
B00171WXII|5|Highly recommend this item. For us, both of our children have very stuffy noses from about birth to 2 and just need to \\"hose the nose\\" often to help prevent colds going on longer than they should. This is that hose for us. It is easy, quick, and simple. You get to see it working, feel it working and it's so fast and much more comfortable to use as well for both. The hospital bulbs are great but don't last forever as you just can't keep them sanitized well enough, for very long. This is quick to clean and totally hygienic as there's the filter as well. This is a great item to have for the stuffy baby noses.
B004L2JJAA|5|nice one.. as expected, can see my lil one from my drivers seat.. the clip on is more helpful than the suction attachment.
B008CDR7LW|3|This is a kid's toy but it only has 6 legs, which is just odd. Other than that it's a fine toy.
B002Y5XJCU|1|the picture on the package shows the tether extending from stroller to child.  It does not extend - after you loop it through something, it is too short to extend to baby therefore it can hold a sippy cup, for example, but the child cannot drink from it.  Has no friction around bottles - it just slides off.  Should have said how long the strap is on the package.
B005SNHVZ6|5|My kid loves the dishes.Very durable set and perfect for those tiny hands ! Arrived packed very secure.Love it I Might get diffrent collors in future!
B000UYFULU|2|Although many people love this product I found it complicated to put on. Also, it's best worn over silk or Lycra because being cotton itself it sticks to your cotton shirt, making it hard to adjust. I opted for a Becco Gemini soft carrier instead and I love it and so does my baby!
B00IMHVYV2|4|Love the caps, but wish I paid more attention to the size of the pouch. My perpetually hungry 18mo son inhales the 4oz pouches. Washes easy (if you get to it in a timely manner) and survived the dishwasher, still looking like new.
B00997OB82|1|This isn't worth it. I received mine earlier today and was greatly disapointed with it. It is not 13.5cm long its more like 5 cm long its ot what I was looking for at all
B00208RTEA|5|Exactly what we were looking for. Our daughter's crib is pretty large and wide, but this fit on it perfectly. Have had no problems with it and it has kept our girl from chewing up the crib.
B00ARTRNY0|5|We love these as burp cloths. Since we use cloth diapers also it was important our burp cloths were easy to distinguish from the burp cloths, these do the trick. Very absorbent. Come very clean in the wash. Was happy to see that Amazon offered them cheaper than some stores near us. I also purchased the pack of white ones.
B00EIGL9TI|5|Great value! My daughter loves them
B00L9NR672|5|Love it!!!
B00HVXKF4A|5|A real glass, that won't slip on the table or out of my daughter's hands! Yay!
B0054HSVGE|5|With hundreds of options for a mattress, I have to say, our newborn loves it just fine.  I really haven't thought twice about this purchase, save your money and get this item, it hasn't lost any shape and works wonderfully, fitting perfectly snug in our crib.
B000JVTT98|4|So far I haven't had any problems with this thing. It makes a crazy amount of bubbles, which my son just goes nuts over. He is 2, so at the age of looooving bubbles. It is a little noisy, and seems to take a lot of bubble solution each time. But the amount of bubble solution I guess is because mine seems to make a ton of bubbles during his bath. So far those are the only drawbacks I have found.
B00JGF1H7K|5|Worked great with the breast pump
B000A0IC78|5|This brand (Bumpkins) is the greatest of all the bibs out there.  Three years after buying them, they look brand new and have been run through the washing machine hundreds of times!  Two or three of these bibs is all you'll ever need; they're worth the extra cost.
B0011H9MFA|4|I love the first year calendars as a convenient way to keep track of all those baby milestones that can also be used to fill in the baby book when you actually have time for that undertaking. I love the Baby Prints calendar in particular for its simple and elegant design, which is decorated primarily by my own baby's photos and foot (and/or hand) prints. The only bummer about this calendar is that it doesn't have an extra month to actually complete that first year - to make it to the first birthday, a 13th month page is necessary, to repeat the birthday month. Especially given the milestones that often take place right around that first birthday, I've really missed not having that extra month page. But I still bought this calendar for subsequent babies because it is otherwise so tasteful.
B0000W3TX8|5|As promised, this is my follow-up from a previous review.  After using this over Mother's Day weekend, I would not use anything else.  There is so much storage space, we didn't need the stroller; the diapers, wipes, bottles and more fit easily into the ample storage compartments.  My 14mo old daughter loves this!  In fact, she loves it so much she cried to get back in when I took her out of it.<br />The canopy is great and did a fantastic job of keeping the sun off of her.  After practice at putting the canopy on and taking it off, it's now a snap to use.  It's able to be folded up and tucked away between the detachable storage compartments on the back of the pack.<br />The kickstand is handy to use the backpack as a seat for her when we sat down to take a break.  I heard nothing but &quot;WOW&quot;s and &quot;Awesome&quot; from other people the whole time I was walking around with her in it.  It was as if no one had ever seen such a thing before, which I find hard to believe.  While at the zoo we went into exhibits that didn't allow strollers (while laughing to myself) and had no problems getting around with this.  While parents had to park their strollers outside, we went about the exhibits with no problem.<br />Do yourself a favor and at least try this.  It's reasonably priced and you'll be thankful you did it - for yourself and for your child.  Depending on where you buy, you can always take it back if you don't like it.
B0019QCGVK|5|Great textures, colors, and size
B00KWR2BCQ|5|I was looking for a quality pillow, extremely soft pillowcase, and not too big. Need it to rest my arm on it as I have a very severe nerve condition. This is perfect for my needs. So glad I purchased this!
B00FXOYGMQ|5|Cute prints and soft material! Great for a new baby!
B00192FN7I|5|THANK GOD FOR SWINGS, JUST BOUGHT THIS FISHER-PRICE SWING<br />AS SOON I RECEIVED IT. PUT IT TOGETHER. AND VOILA!<br />FELL ASLEEP LIKE A ROCK.
B00AJSIS9S|4|I have 2 of these- one in the spare car and one for the babysitter.  They are semi easy to install (though the latches are very rigid and hard to dislodge), I was glad when I could turn them around and get rid of the latch attachments.  Comes with a cup holder which is removable.  I never attached them so I cannot speak to how well they work.  The seat only goes up to 40 lbs, butt he price is decent and this is not her primary seat so I am happy with my purchases.  The cover is easy to remove for cleaning and the color is nice (this same seat in the Willa color is more vibrant)  and there is a recline mechanism under the seat for rear facing infants.. Nothing fancy here, just a sturdy seat.
B002WN2BKU|5|Just the right amount of tableware for our picnics in the park. And, so affordable that if you lose one.. no big deal baby.<br />Dishwasher safe! Yeah!
B0034G4MCE|2|While the bag is functional, I would have thought that for the price that you pay, the bag would be of higher quality. It did not even survive one flight (one way). Before the return flight I patched all the tears and holes with duct tape. While that kept the tears from getting larger, it could not prevent additional tears on the return flight.  We have the city mini, and it's travel bag and never had any issues with multiple flights. I think that they went with low quality material for the stroller.   If you need this for just a single trip, then realize that it will be destroyed after that trip. I doubt the manufacturer will stand behind its quality.
B000BV4T9Q|1|We bought this monitor to replace a 10-year old monitor (Fisher-Price) we bought at a garage sale for $2, mainly to be able to use more than one monitor in our household.    It became immediately apparent after the first use that this monitor performed very much worse than our garage sale monitor. It greatly amplifies higher frequencies, so that if you use a white noise generator or fan, you can hardly hear anything else in the room you are monitoring. Even in a very silent room, it manges to pick up white noise.    The volume control on the receiver unit is nearly useless, mainly because turning up the volume only gives you more noise. As we wish to monitor our sleeping kids and not white noise, we returned this unit.
B002GKC4LA|2|I ordered despite the reviews saying the product has rough edges and the beautiful colors soon fade. I imagined those were outlying experiences and that the manufacturer would rectify such manufacturing flaws. Well, for what it's worth, the one I ordered has some rough edges, and being in a sunlit room ruined the colors after 3 to 4 months.
B005DMDG2E|5|This item is very nice.. Just what i expected and it is also very easy to clean as well. Wide enough to take all the mess.
B004GEXGK2|4|I have had this car seat for over 2 years now and I love it.     First, I'll say that I never did use it as rear-facing, I haven't been in an accident since my DD was born, and I don't have this exact color (I have pink and grey). Also, I actually bought a second one a few days after the first so I wouldn't have to constantly move one between cars.  I love both of them and they have both held up equally well to about 75k miles between them (in 2 1/2 years).  Sure, the colors have faded in the sun, but the fabric is still sturdy, even after 3 or 4 washings per carseat and 2 1/2 years of no garage (in SC, CT, and NH).    I love this car seat because it's such a beast and easy to operate on a daily basis.  It fully and sturdily protects my DD, it seems to be comfortable, and it is easy for me to use.  I also consider it a plus that at 3 1/2 years old, my DD still is unable to unbuckle herself (mothers of multiple children may disagree, lol!).  Cons that might bother other people are its size (if you have a small car and/or multiple children) and how difficult it is to clean, although I'm not sure that other car seats are any easier to disassemble and clean.    My specifics: We have put it into our '92 Galant, our '03 Ram 2500, our late-model Charger and Challenger, and friends' various minivans, all without difficulty (as forward facing only).  We only have 1 child, and we bought it just before her 1st birthday.    The rest of my review includes (hopefully!) helpful tips:   -I have learned to adjust the straps to my daughter BEFORE it is installed (forward facing) as it is MUCH easier to pull on the straps when you can pull down on the metal joiner in the back, while at the same time pulling up the smaller strap between the legs.     -Keep your instructions handy for a LONG WHILE - when baby gets carsick, the WHOLE THING comes apart for washing, but it's tricky and time-consuming.  I honestly don't know how the manufacturer recommends to clean it, but after my DD throws up in it, I throw everything fabric in the washer and then in the dryer.  The only thing I don't dry is the actual carseat strap!  The molded plastic cleans up just fine any way you choose - hose, bathtub, baby wipes, whatever!    -The key to cleaning the Alpha Omega is to know that you'll NEED to pull off the base (as if to make it a booster, when looking in the instructions for how-to) in order to fully clean all the plastic as well as in order to get the fabric off for machine washing.  Take off the plastic grommets that hold the fabric to the molded carseat. Those are VERY HARD to get off, but try a large flathead screwdriver (or maybe pliers?) and go slowly and try to squeeze the grommet in on itself to slide it up through the molded seat, being careful not to break them.  (They go back in MUCH easier than they come out, though!) There are two in the seat, next to baby's bum, and two in the backrest. I don't always need to take the backrest fabric off to clean the seat, but if you do, that fabric takes some serious effort to get off and on.      Here is some universal advice, not necessarily specific to the Alpha Omega line:  -The LATCH buckle (not the metal loops that go on the car, but the plastic buckle that keeps it cinched tight) is very strong and it can be frustrating trying to uninstall the carseat once you have it cinched down.  Kneel into the seat, push on the release button and push down and away from the carseat.  You have to get the angle right or the buckle will just keep tight.  To get the loops off the car, try pushing the release flap and twist the whole carabiner-like loop 90-180 degrees, then pull it away from the car.  I can't get them off any other way!    -DO NOT DRY THE BELT IN THE DRYER!!!  It can damage the fibers and make them less effective in a crash. Just hang it to dry and it'll be good to go by the next morning.  Also, LATCH belts don't come off, so don't bother trying.  And don't be like my hubby on our original infant carrierand cut the strap off with scissors, LOL!!!!  New parents...geez! ;)    -Take your time when rethreading the seatbelt through all it's holes and putting the accessories back on, or you'll wind up with things on backwards and either redoing it all (if you're a neat-freak like me) or twisting the straps to make it work.  I have rethreaded the seatbelt three and four times before trying to make all the accessories perfect, LOL!  So just think it all through before you go threading it all on there!
B001AARNFY|4|This bag doesn't have all of the bells and whistles that many of the larger bags have, but we wanted a smaller, simpler starter bag for shorter trips/outings, and this will certainly fit the bill.  I really hated having an oversized bag with my older daughter for shorter trips.  It was just huge and cumbersome and absolutely unnecessary.  So, we knew we'd eventually want two bags, one for quick trips and another one from when we're doing major trips (like road trips, or flying out of town, etc.).  This bag will be great for the day-to-day, shorter trips and errands.  There's lots of pockets/storage, and we especially like the fact that it doesn't look like other typical diaper bags, and the bright color is awesome and fun.  Once our twin daughters are bigger and we need to worry about packing more stuff (larger clothes, bottles, snacks, larger/more toys, etc.) we'll consider a bigger bag. However, for the first several months, this will work great.  Part of why I chose this bag is that I'm interested in the larger backpack bag from this brand, so I figured getting the cheaper, smaller one might be a good way to see how we liked the durability and organization of this bag before investing in the more expensive bigger one.  So far, we're please with this purchase.
B00BHKGVLO|5|Great Highchair! I love it. Small and not to clunky. Great support for my baby!
B00006C29H|5|Our 5 month old daughter has been using this for almost two months and LOVES it!!  It is incredibly solid and secure and easy to put together.  Her favorite toys are the little round rattles on the side of the seat--mesmerizing, in fact--and the microphones on either end of the keyboard side.  She will try to fit those in her mouth all the time!  Now that she's bigger, it's fun to watch her try to jump up and down on the keys.  She's content in it for about 20-30 minutes at a time, and I probably put her in it twice a day so I can fold laundry, vacuum, etc.  I would highly recommend this to someone who is looking for a musical exersaucer.  The only downside is that it is not a small piece of equipment--you need a pretty decent size space to leave it in since it does not fold up at all.
B003M9IQAC|5|I am really liking this stroller. It is definitely more substantial than your average umbrella stroller and is in between the size of an umbrella and full size stroller. It can handle bumps and cobblestones in the city easily which is huge for us- we live near New Orleans and the sidewalks are uneven. It also has a giant sun shade which is also a must to block out the hot sun and sometimes heavy rains here. Folding was a bit tricky at first but easy with practicing a few times.  Best of all my 13 month old daughter is comfortable in this stroller, unlike our last umbrella stroller. It's cushy and she is really able to relax in it. The adjustable foot rest is great.  The crotch strap sits lower on her body than other strollers, but not a big deal in my opinion. I'm happy with this purchase. Strollers with similar features sell for double or triple this price so I think this stroller is a great deal.
B00IYTTO2Y|3|I like the portion size, great for mixing flavors and adding variety to baby's meals, but the silicone rips easily when taking it out of the hard plastic.
B00HUARZSS|5|I have tried a number of disposable nursing bra pads (Lansinoh, Tommee Tippee), but this is by far the superior product. It is very easy to put in, sticks well, and is very durable. Never had an accident with this.
B000YJ89K0|3|The hitch hiker was delivered one day early which was great. It works pretty good but when I run with the jogging stroller one of the wheels from the hitch hiker shakes sometimes and I have to kick it in order to stop it from shaking. I don't think the product is worth the price.
B005P07HS8|5|Yes, they are a little pricey but I was paying at least $7 per month for the disposables so these will pay for themselves in less than 6 months.  They are very comfortable and I throw them in any and all loads of laundry with good results.  I'm a nursing mother who is constantly covered in bodily fluids so people staring at my breasts and judging wrinkles in my clothing are not high on my list of concerns.  However, these pads do contour much better to my breasts than the disposables.  I don't feel wet if I leak and soaking through hasn't been a problem so far.  Highly recommend.
B0010TSK2K|5|Purchased this as the first toddler bed for my 2 year old son. I was a bit worried as he loved to jump in his crib that he would do the same with this and break it. Luckily I've got him to stop jumping so I can't really review on how long it would last with a child jumping on it. I'm very pleased with this purchase and my son as well as myself love this bed! He has no problems sleeping in it and it's perfect for him. He can climb in and out without any issues and usually falls asleep very fast and easy in it. Was a bit of work getting it put together and the instructions could be better, but we figured it out and it's working great! Would totally recommend this bed to anyone!
B001Q87LI4|4|It's much bigger than other brands and is shaped by darts so it can wrap around you body a bit.  The boning in the top doesn't hold the fabric out as well as I'd hoped but I'd still buy it again.
B00Y9AR870|5|The One Z pillow has been a LIFESAVER. After trying countless nursing pillows unsuccessfully, I luckily came across the One Z pillow. I had been experiencing back pain and eventually occipital neuralgia (nerve pain) from being hunched over nursing. I would use multiple pillows to try to position my baby girl correctly to breastfeed. The One Z got rid of the need for extra pillows as it has support for the baby and my back all in one! I especially recommend it for women that delivered via c-section. My daughter is now 8 months old and I can place her in it so she's in a comfy position with her toys and books around her!
B00J407WGW|5|One of our best baby purchases yet! Chose this chair as a trial run when we finally got to the point where we had to make a purchase. We originally registered for two different, more expensive high chairs (hadn't chosen between the two), when we decided to &#34;try out&#34; a cheaper chair before making the investment. So glad I took my husband's advice and restarted the search. This chair was definitely not on our radar and I was skeptical that an even decent chair could be so functional and affordable; but I am HAPPY I found it!<br /><br />For starters, it is very cute (fits well with our existing breakfast area furniture), compact, easy to clean and well-designed! The chair was easy to install and is very functional! Despite critical reviews regarding the sliding mechanism on the tray, with regular use it is easy to get the hang of. As some reviewers pointed out already, you should definitely make sure baby's fingers are out of the way before sliding the tray forward as it seems that one could mistakenly get little fingers pinched (we have not had this problem, however).<br /><br />Cannot say enough good things about this chair. So many of the other complaints about highchairs (big, bulky, hard to clean, take up too much space, dangerous) do not apply to this chair. Our baby started using it at 6 months and still fits in it with what seems like ample room to grow at 7 months! The only thing I would change, as others have mentioned, is that the straps are white and it is unwieldy to remove them as well as the green cushion; but spot cleaning with a damp cloth (and soap and warm water or a little Oxyclean Baby stain remover when needed) in between washes is easy enough.
B000YHA7O8|5|This lock is surprisingly strong, and helps keep our kitchen cabinets locked and our baby safe. What I love about this lock is that I can open and close it quickly with one hand when I'm preparing dinner or putting groceries away and need to get in to the cabinets quickly. Many child-safety locks can be a real big pain for adults, but this one is a pleasure to deal with.
B000MQK4YY|4|This is a cute little outfit. It looks and feels well made, but my grandaughter is not here yet so I have not seen it on.
B0060S8SIW|4|It is really comfortable and compact. My 4 year old son loves it. But he is a normal size boy. I think it will no be so comfortable for a a bigger kid.
B00526ICYI|5|I don't even have a baby -- what I do have is a teen and a tween.  I also have a finished basement where my kids hang out and I like to monitor what goes on down there.  I can clearly hear and view from 3 floors up!  The clarity is superb, the features are great.  As the description states, you can hook this up to skype so you can even see what's going on if you are not even home.  So when my teen is babysitting, I can see what's going on from my iphone via skype!  How cool is that?!  There is also a \\"talk\\" button so if you choose, you can use it as an intercom system.  I have been playing around with it and so far, I'm super impressed with what this can do.  If you have any place in your home you want to monitor, this is the item.  This is not just a \\"baby monitor\\", it's an in-home surveillance system and can even give you peace of mind when you aren't home.  I would think this would be a great item to keep an eye on a puppy as well.  Highly recommend.  It is expensive but the quality and features make it worth the price.
B00ED20K9M|5|Darling baby gift!
B0000E0JDV|1|I found this item very cumbersome.  When the rail is in the down position it is dangerous to young children playing in the room.  It's a pain to put up and down and it lasted about a week before one of the hinges broke.  Definitely not worth the time or the money!
B006YNM5DC|5|Best swaddles on the market! They are so versatile. We are now phasing putlet daughter out of the swaddle since she's started rolling. We let one arm out at a time and these swaddles make that very easy rather than buying one of those specialty swaddles made for transitioning. And it's organic! Huge plus :)
B006OK477C|3|Very cute pouch…I can fit two size 4 diapers, 2 of the Munchkin changing pads and some disposable bibs. However, this pouch is great if you have a large bag, but it doesn't fit in a medium tote or satchel unless you don't carry anything else.
B002UD65GI|5|wonderful. grandkids  loved them.
B000FFL58Q|5|MY 6 MONTH OLD BABY LOVES IT
B00113ALAO|4|I have used this since my daughter was 1 week old.  It is not her favorite, she prefers her swing.  but we keep this in our bedroom so when I need to put her down to do something, she has a seat instead of having to lay in her bassinet.    Now that she is older she seems to like the seat more.  She loves the little giraffe toy and bats at it every time she is in the seat!    I am giving this 4 stars because after almost 3 months of use it makes a slight buzzing noise when the vibration is turned on.  not loud enough to be annoying though.  But, that is really the only problem I have with this.  I have not needed to replace the batteries yet and the seat cover is removable for washing.  and my daghter seems to be comfortable in this.  She loves to make it bounce!
B00P6WZ7QY|5|I love this attachment because it is SO sturdy.  It can not be easily pulled by a child.  It will stay in the position that the adult put it! It works great for my toddler, who wants to pull everything down/apart.  I would definitely recommend this product.
B0017VMH5M|5|This is a great product! This is probably the most plush and comfortable bouncer on the market. My son only just grew out of it, and he is 7 months old! It has a great head rest and side flaps for when your baby is small (our son was under 6lbs when we brought him home), but they are removable for when your baby gets bigger. He grew out of his swing around 3 months, but this was great for daytime naps when he was about 3-6 months old and was pretty much the only place we could put our son where he would actually stay asleep! This was also the chair we used to feed our son his first solids before we moved him to his highchair.    The toy bar is good for newborns who are just looking at the dangling items, but once the baby is old enough to reach and grab for things, it is somewhat useless. However, at that point, you can just give them a toy or teether to hold while they are in the bouncer, so it doesn't matter. My son loved the mirrored son when he was very young; it was actually one of the first \\"toys\\" he took an interest in!     The vibration feature is also very good. Many bouncers on the market have vibration features that are loud and jarring, but this bouncer is very quiet and relaxing. The little tunes are cute too... kinda like baby elevator music.    Overall, a wonderful product and a MUST for new parents! If you are trying to decide among bouncers, this is the one! I wish they made this in an adult size!
B00FFSRL5Y|5|Awesome! Fit over prefolds even on my newborn and grew with her! Still going strong at 5 months! Double gusseted so no leaks at all:)
B0055V0VGM|5|Work perfectly on both the classic ergo and the 360
B008KG5R6I|5|My granddaughter loves this. Her parents were given one when she was born. She is now 2 yrs old and has to have it when sleeps. It blocks out noise from the road and talking etc. in the house. A purchase that was well worth it.
B001KZH69C|5|I am raising my 3 year old medically challenged grandson that I feed thru the night via a feeding pump.  With all he has going on thru the night and making messes and getting sick often, I MUST wash his bed linens every day.  This mattress pad has held up to the test of time.  I have two and I rotate them every morning.  I'm amazed after over a 100 washings each they have no tears in the seams and they practically look like new.  Can't go wrong with these.
B0064ZO5ZG|2|Bought this for my wife, Seemed pretty cumbersome and the baby didn't fit in real well. So, I don't know, go ask my wife.
B00LSOXPZ4|1|Fit horrible. Need to get a size or two larger than what you think. After first wearing the zipper broke. Not impressed.
B000XT30G4|5|This is, by far THE BEST gate to keep my cat the heck out of the kitchen sink!!!!  I have tried numerous gates and they all STINK......................this is GREAT.......only issue is that I don't need all the &#34;extensions&#34; they send along for my purpose and place for the gate..............you MUST not hesitate to order this!
B000I6C6YO|4|These caps are great for the ever leaking Dr. Brown's bottles.  I don't know why I waited so long to buy these!  My only negative comment about these is that they don't fit over the tan inserts that sit in the mouth of the bottle.  You have to remember to put those and the blue resevoirs in your bag seperately, which I have a tendency to forget.  This is just a personal annoyance though!
B00J69XJ04|4|Great carseat. Even big enough for my toddler to still fit in it. Only thing is the canopy is tiny.
B001UF8BL4|5|great toy
B00KN4LOZS|4|Simple and inexpensive. What more could you ask for?
B002RL7UWQ|1|I would give 0 stars if I could. Sick 11 month old and the temp registered 97° when she was clearly burning up, quick trip to the Dr to find out she was 100.7° and had an ear infection!!! I also checked it on myself to make sure and it read my temp at 95.2° which is obviously wrong. Cheap! I guess you get what you pay for! Now it is peacefully resting in the trash! Avoid at all costs!
B00005NKXU|5|l love this Diaper bag b/c it's big alot of space! and believe me every mom sure needs all that space...  a must have! not too <BR>heavy and l love the changing pad that comes attached to it. love it!
B00HQMMLP2|5|These are awesome!! Got them a day earlier than I thought. Made my first batch of pureed food and they popped out easily once frozen! And super easy cleaning as well, I love this product!
B002ZB8298|5|nada melhor do que você dormir tranquilamente, sem ficar ansioso com seu bebê.  alem disso tem a praticidade de levar o aparelho portatil quando estiver andando pela casa.
B00BMTKPVW|4|Very pretty and clings to the wall<br />Well
B008HPP7XA|2|I wanted to love this mattress, especially with all the positive reviews, but I just can't. Here's why:<br /><br />1. We have a standard crib ('Sleigh Fixed Gate' ordered through PB Kids) and there is about 2-3 inches of space between the crib and the mattress. It simply doesn't fit and we would absolutely never use it with an infant. I agree it is way too soft for an infant. At an absolute minimum, I wouldn't use this on any child under 2 for the safety piece alone.<br /><br />2. The mattress already appears to have an indentation in the middle. We had ordered this for our 2 1/2 year old who weighs 32 pounds. I wouldn't expect this within such a short period of time (we ordered in June 2014). If you're expecting Tempurpedic quality, don't. You might consider waiting until your little one can sleep in a twin bed and buy the real thing.<br /><br />I regret that we didn't return within the window. I kept hoping that maybe it would take time to fill out, being that it had been vacuum-packed. But it is just as poorly fitting now as it was when it first arrived. Because there are so many 5 star reviews, I think I will reach out to the manufacturer and see if perhaps I got a defective mattress. I'm hoping their customer service is excellent. That could make my rating go up, or go to 1 star. We shall see. I will update as soon as I hear back.<br /><br />At this point, the softer side of the moonlight dual slumber which our 6 month old sleeps on would have been a much better choice.<br /><br />On the positive side, our little one seems to enjoy it. But he enjoyed his much firmer mattress before so I can't say definitively whether this has actually improved his sleep quality or not.
B00KLN8D5K|5|Love it. Nice and roomy and stay organized.  Changing mat is not to my taste but I already had one so I just use the old one.
B0038RVD6W|5|These are the best overnight diapers.  So absorbent, never leave red marks.  Combine with a hemp pad and these will stand up to the heaviest wetter.
B004FGT48Y|5|Looked expensive everyone love these would definitely buy these again!!! Wonderful product amazing price and fancy looking you won't regret purchasing this product
B001ARYDFA|5|Everyone who sees this in my water garden loves it. I take it out of the water to save battery life when not in use.
B00CW9IFT0|4|Good stroller. Maneuvers very well. Works perfectly with the combi shuttle carseat base. Fits through all doorways in my house. My daughter loves it and didn't want to get out. Storage is hard to get to. Cup holder for parents gets in the way through a tight doorway. No where to hang purse. But I knew these things from all the reviews I read online. Visors cover well.<br />My sister had a combi double stroller for her kids a few years back so I somewhat knew what to expect. She was always very happy with her's and I had strolled her kids in it many times and liked the feel of it and how it handled.<br />Overall I am very happy with this stroller. I would have purchased even if I did not have a combi car seat, but it is perfect since I do!
B00HPD4V1Y|5|I was skeptical, but we love these. They are a great size, seem durable, and are really easy to clean. I was worried the bottom zipper would leak or my 2.5 year old would learn to open it, but that hasn't been a problem at all. It is really convenient to fill with leftover smoothie or applesauce as we're running out the door. I would highly recommend them.
B00T63ROW4|5|Cute, good quality, packaged well and arrived super fast.
B001UFBVA2|1|I unfortunately bought this product before reading the reviews because i got it from babies r us. When i saw it i liked the design, and the fact that you had 3 different thermometers to attach to the main base depending on if you want oral, rectal or arm temperature. I thought it would be safer and cleaner since there would be no confusion :) BUT this thing is not accurate at all!! I was always advised to take an arm temperature since it's believed to be the most accurate but with this thermometer my baby always had a 35.2C temperature which is way below normal temp (37.2). I haven't used the oral and rectal to compare because i don't trust it anyways. I can't return it i threw the package away! Also the fact that it's reading the temp in 5 seconds is not great actually. It's better to have a thermometer that takes longer to make sure it reads it correctly. Also the blue light is so bright that sometimes you can't even read the temp. DO NOT BUY!
B000X2HC9W|5|This bag is very spacious and has a place for everything, including two large cups.  Great accessory for smaller strollers!
B004QW7HWW|5|Love it.
B000I0TF9E|5|I needed to get a pump to maintain breast milk flow after I was diganosed with postpartum preeclampsia  (You can't nurse while on the medication or for 18 hours after you are taken off meds)  I used the double hospital pump while in the hospital, but found it difficult to keep two pumps going at the same time.  I looked at several reviews and the style of this pump and chose to purchase this rather than renting a hospital pump.  It is easy to use and maintain.  Highly recommend this item
B008MCX62W|5|This is so soft, and cute.
B005JAICFQ|5|This is up on the wall, ready for the kids to read and re-read.  They don't know it yet, but this is the start of what they wish for, they have all wished to see Disneyland and Oct 2013 that will come true, but they don't know it.  This is large, it will also be easy to remove when the time comes. this says it all.
B0035XCJ3A|5|My daughter absolutely loves her Owly!!! She loves ot so much that we have ordered a couple more so she always has a clean one!!! They work wonderfully with her teething and are super absorbant!!!
B00006AKYQ|4|We received this as a baby shower present before our baby was born.  Our chidl is now 15 months old, and my husband and I love this diaper trash bag dispenser.  It's always in our diaper bag, and it's great for trips, both long and short.  Whether you're visiting the grandparents for the day or staying in a hotel for vacation, these bags are essential for keeping soiled diapers contained.  The cute and compact duck dispenser is a bonus.  The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it's not easy to pull a bag out of the dispenser.  Instead, it's easier to turn the duck in order to loosen the bag in the dispenser and then tear it off at the right spot.  If it were easier to pull out a bag, the dispenser would be perfect!
B000G6BZJI|2|The price on this gate was lower than most. When removing it from where I use it I have to be careful not to let both sides of the gate come apart. It then becomes a bear to reinstall and put back in the doorway.
B00HPD4V1Y|5|We absolutely love these! I frequently fill with applesauce and store in the fridge for quick grab and go snacks for my little one (and mom sometimes!).  Easy to clean. Durable. Very happy.
B0051UN5SI|5|Very cute In car Windows!! I got 2  of them I wanted something diffrent!!  Enjoy the little monkey. Love Fisher Price!
B00GKF71Y2|3|The unit is compact and fits in any bag easily. It takes the temp relatively fast. My son wiggles a lot so it is hard to get him to hold still. I have been able to take his temp with this though. I wish it would reset just a tad quicker but you just have to wait for the ear symbol to show up and you can scan again.
B004P42PK0|5|Have gotten one of these as a gift twice already. I receive so many pictures because the babies love these mats! The main thing everyone raved about was the fact it is machine washable. Great gift...always a hit at baby showers.
B00L88TNKG|5|When I received this in the mail, I was surprised by how big the box was. Let's be clear, this is no small cushion. I'm a pretty big guy, and this thing is more than big enough for my tush. It's also more stiff than I was expecting, especially since it's memory foam. It's not as soft as you would think, but that doesn't take away from the comfort of using this. I could see this going fantastic in a car, or in a lawn chair perhaps. Unlimited uses.
B001GBMDUW|5|These wall stickers were easy to apply. I even changed my mind a couple times and was able to remove them and re-stick on a different area. They've been up for about a month and have stayed put! I used the decals to complement the rest of the enchanted forest decor in my baby's nursery and they look great with the tree I painted on the wall.     A couple weeks ago, I had some guests over, and several of them asked me \\"Were those stencils hard for you to paint?\\" and \\"Who painted those animals for you?\\" so they must look hand-painted rather than like a sticker, which is exactly what I wanted. I added some photos, so you can see what they look like on an actual wall.    I would recommend checking the price periodically before buying these, as they often go for 25% off list price.
B000EI8L0O|5|I did some research before purchasing these gates.  I'm using them to keep our dog out of an area of the house.  It allows her to see through, which is nice.  Tall enough so that if she gets on her hind legs, she won't jump over.  Installation was easy enough to do alone without damaging my walls.  I like the fact that an extension is included as well.  The look is clean and neat and the gate is very easy to use.  Well worth the money.
B00ONY7L1K|5|love it it fit great
B0043IS18I|5|This fan helped during the hot summer to keep baby cool.  Don't leave in hot car batteries will bust.  Overall worth the buy.
B004AHMCKA|5|my grandson loves this toy and it's a great product for the price and a wonderful babysitter. it is very durable and actually has a great suction cup that is not easily broken
B00006H3D9|5|I've loved this car seat from the beginning.  We received it as a gift when my daughter was past the infant stage but have used it for every stage since.  The best thing about it: that red lever at the bottom.  It allows you to change the level of the car seat, making it so the child can be sitting upright or laying down.  Great for those car naps where a 2-year-old's head has no support in other car seats and their poor little head drops to their chest.  Well, not in this car seat.  Pull out the lever and they are laying back comfortably.  We're working on baby number two and planning on buying another one so each child has their own.  Great buy and worth the money!!!
B00BCCE7HM|5|I ordered half a dozen of these piggy banks to give as baby gifts.  They are adorable!  But the pink one is my favorite.  I fill them with a roll of quarters and give them to new moms.  The bank is good sized (not too large or small) and comes in a cute oval box with a bow on it.  I was able to remove the lid and insert the coins and reseal it.  I didn't even need to be wrapped.  All the banks arrived in great condition.  I will be reordering this item.
B004W02YMG|5|Came a day early! Its so comfy and great support on both my belly and back. So glad I spent the extra money for this pillow. This being my third pregnancy and trying other brands I am very pleased.
B001UF8BL4|3|I wanted my baby to like this toy because in theory it's a great idea. I gave this to him at 5 months and at 6 months it still doesn't get played with too often. It's also led to quite a few head bonks and for whatever reason the hard plastic side is always what ends up hitting him on the head. But it's easy for him to get ahold of and makes noise so maybe he will like it later on. It's honestly not a bad toy, just not one that my son in particular enjoys.
B004XJ9IN4|1|Poor quality, stop working after four months.<br />for something this expensive, you will expect it last<br />for at least one year or two.<br />Save your money.
B003WI0BM4|5|Summer Infant baby monitor battery. Bought for my girls monitor.<br />Works very good. No issues to report. We recommended it.
B005C9ODQ6|5|This is by far the best style of carrier I've tried! Ring slings were too difficult to use with a newborn and not structured enough, and the ergo was too bulky and not ideal for extended periods. The mei tai is comfy, easy to use, and offers just enough support without being too bulky. Would highly recommend to anyone interested in learning to babywear - definitely great for newbies who don't want to tackle those complicated wrap style carriers.
B00MRZIGWA|5|These things are sort of magical, really. I purchased a two-pack, expecting to be disappointed. I was NOT disappointed, and ended up ordering two more. I can toss them in my bag with no spills whatsoever. I have seen them leave minor splashes on the floor, but only when &#34;dropped&#34; fairly hard.<br /><br />At first I was afraid that my child wouldn't be able to figure out how to use it. I filled it up only partially for the trial run, and that was my mistake. Once I filled it almost to the brim, she didn't have to tip it so far to experiment.<br /><br />The magic-making gasket at top can be a bit difficult to get off, but I figure that's a plus, since it means that the kid can't get it off. If the cup gets greasy, it can be hard to grip it well enough to unscrew the lid. These are minor drawbacks. All in all, this is a really fantastic cup.
B004I10VXI|1|My brother purchased this as a baby shower gift for us.  It did not work well with our Britax B-angle stroller.  Because the loops go around the front of the handle, instead of the sides of the handle, it swings back and forth as you walk.  It is quite annoying.  I'm assuming this works on some strollers, but not the Britax.  I suggest you instead buy the Britax brand stroller organizer, it is fantastic!
B00E8NQ9E6|5|my baby book said that around 8 months it's time for a soft baby ball. it turns out that there are very few on the market, so when i found this cute parrot ball, i was excited. he is so insanely cute and the chime really got our girl interested. the wings are probably the best feature (besides the cuteness) since it made it easy for chunky hangs to grasp the ball.
B001OOG9OM|5|Item was as described and arrived quickly.  This glo worm is more compact than new ones, sound and light is great.  Thank you.
B007NG5UF4|5|Work great--amazingly clear sound without interference.
B000IDSLOG|5|My Sophie love her Sophie ! Great teether and cute little soft toy
B001H1AC0Y|5|Great purchase!
B0052QYLUM|5|I really love this baby monitor! It's affordable, got great video and audio, and has been held reliable for nearly 2 years now. It's quite a basic monitor so do not expect anything fancy. We were deciding between a IP camera and this, but since we didn't want one of our iphones or ipads completely dedicated to monitoring our baby, we wanted a seperate screen that can always be on. This was it and we are glad we got it for a great deal.
B0006UF43M|5|I had originally purchase one of these great seats for a trip with our then 1.5 year old, about a year ago. I intended to use it for air travel and a short term 5 point stroller. (I was expecting at the time and was going to be buying a tandem stroller soon.) It has turned into her everyday carseat and stroller. We love this thing.<br /><br />Although the first month or so I did have brusies on my arm from converting it, I have since gotten the hang of it and is no longer a problem. It is much lighter then her other convertable seat. So much so I was still able at 39 weeks pregnant to convert it with her in it(daughter was about 26lbs at the time)! It just makes travel much easier. As our second child is quickly out growing the infant carrier, I have even contacted the company to see if there is anyway of attaching 2 of these for use as a double stroller. They replied with they are working on it and hope to have something out in the next year or so.<br /><br />As not to go on and on, all I have to say is if you want to make getting around with baby simpler, whether around town or the world, buy one of these seats. It will be the best investment you make in baby gear. I just wish I had bought mine sooner.
B000XKIBPI|5|This lamp looks delightful in my granddaughters' princess-styled bedroom! It comes in several colors and viewing the colors on the site were very accurate.
B001KXE2NC|5|I wish I was young again so I could put the pedal to the plastic and cruse around my neighborhood. The car was easy to put together and of course had to wait 24hrs for the initial charge. It works on both sidewalk and my backyard grass. Motor is stronger then most 6v motors found on EBay.  It could be due to the large size battery. Charger has its own plug in port so you don't have to keep disconnecting the battery to connect it to the charger.<br />Delivery was fast as described ( Just wish it wasn't sent Via FedEx they tend to be rough on the packages and this time crack the plastic car in 3 areas :(
B006QT2C1E|5|Super quick shipping. Item exactly as described. A+
B0054Z0PN8|4|Nice color, soft and fits pad well.  Would like it even more if the color of orange was less &#34;dreamsicle&#34; and a more vibrant, true orange in color.  Nevertheless - it works with the design and color choice of our nursery and I am happy with the purchase.
B00579Q468|5|I attached this to my son's changing table and it helps keeping the bathroom organized and his clothes separated from ours.
B007NG5UEU|5|We purchased this monitor as an upgrade for a hand-me-down that a neighbor had shared with us.  I wish we had upgraded sooner.  Great reception even at the maximum of its range and very little static.  2 parent ends mean that there's not the daily chore of lugging the monitor from living room to bedroom and back again.  Would absolutely purchase again.
B00FZGLI00|5|I have a 14 month old and this is great for playing in the park and play dates
B00501YN20|5|It's thick and very soft. Washes very well and matches the rest of our nursery set. I'm very happy with it.
B001KZH692|4|The sheet fits the baby mattress just fine, but it's very thin and feels a little rough.  Not sure how long it will last.
B005365EI4|5|Organic & soft. Covers my 5-month-olds entire chest & shoulders. Wide neck hole a little big now, but means this bib will be around until at least the indicated 18-months. Made in Egypt.
B00005BTNA|4|We've used the Vent Aire bottles off and on for the past five months. I like them MUCH better than Dr. Brown's or Avent, but I do think they are a pain to disassemble and clean then reassemble to use. I'm not sure they do what they promise in regards to less gas and spitting up, either. However, they aren't that bad. No leaks or other issues. I'm just not convinced they are worth the fuss!
B00E3RKC36|3|Sits too liw on tge ground
B004B7NWXU|5|My little guy loves this thing! My 4 month old is still a little small for the seat but his legs are long so he touches the bottom and  he loves being able to stand without being held! I just tuck a small pillow behind him in the seat and he bounces and turns all around it. it's great to be able to throw a load of laundry in or go to the bathroom!<br />I was afraid that some of the toys were too close to eyes level for him and have some rough edges, so i just took them off and he's content- until he's older they can stay off so that he doesn't poke himself in the eye!
B00434E7GM|4|Pros:  Colors are nice, fold-up changing pad, diaper and wipe storage, as well as the bassinet insert are all good things...  Set-up was easy 10-20 mins...    Cons when we first tried to take it apart for travel we realized that not all the parts fit in the carry case...  The bassinet insert and changing pad do not fit in the carrying case.  and the metal tubes bend fairly easily so you wouldn't want to just throw them in the back of the car...    All in all we like the unit and leave the bassinet insert and changing pad at home when we travel...
B002UHKL6O|2|I bought it yesterday, because I forgot to bring a cup with us and I am returning it today. I can not deal with the spout spinning around when I tighten it. I gave it to my son not aligned and I just couldn't watch him drink from a cup sideways. This product would be great, if only they made some tabs that held the spout from turning.   I have enough to deal with and I don't need to wrestle a sippy cup daily. Sure you can deal with it, but why? Why would you want to watch your kid use improper form, while learning to drink. There is no reason to.  There are much better products out there for the same cost or less.
B00HPQTJ18|5|awesome.
B0106PXNHK|5|This baby food storage tray made of silicone with clip on lid is really nice. It is not made of a thin cheap silicone, it's actually made of a very durable and thick silicone. This tray has nine sections that hold 2.5 ounces in each section. It is dishwasher safe as well as heat and freezer safe. You can take this product straight from the freezer and place it in the oven. This silicone tray though it's marketed for baby food, can be used for so many other things. I like to use these for homemade broths. I can make a big batch of broth and pour it into these 2.5 ounce sections and freeze them. I then just pop them out and store them in a freezer safe Ziploc bag until I'm ready to use them. I've also seen people place strawberries in each of the sections and pour chocolate over-the-top. Once they have set up you have chocolate covered strawberries. I love how easily the silicone releases from the food. No need for nonstick spray's. This tray also makes good sized ice cubes. If you are like me and hate when your ice melts quickly, you could use these to make 2.5 ounce ice cubes. They take much longer to melt and your drink doesn't get watered down. Overall so many wonderful things you can do with this tray. I purchased this product during a promotion at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
B0033UVJOU|4|Well I didn't use it but if my baby could write this I'm sure she would say...*ZZzzzzzzz* She loved this thing. Best way to calm her down and put her to bed. It was also a LOT easier than the swaddling with a blanket, just place baby in and zip it up! It makes a dad look like a pro every time!
B001GIQVRG|5|Great product, kids are brushing their gums and teeth without knowing it!
B008210T8W|1|Someone's hair was attached to some tape.  SOOOO GROSS! I bought this for sanitary purposes....It is only fit for the trash!
B002NGMXR2|5|i just love this baby carrier! it is very easy to wear, very comfortable for the baby, and the baby falls a sleep in it in just seconds... excelent item.[[ASIN:B002NGMXR2 Ergo baby Ergo Baby Carrier Galaxy Grey]]
B00GHAGOXO|5|This set is so cute. I love the fact that the monkeys are actually gray and not brown. I love the monkey theme and this makes it girly.
B000BM8YMS|1|Our 22 mo. old threw his blanket over the gate and tried to retrieve the blanket and got his hand stuck in between the squares, and I mean PAINFULLY stuck.  Thank God I was able to gently get his hand back out. I later had my husband hold 2 fingers in the square (3/4 the size of the regular squares) where our son had his hand and I then attempted to unlock the gate and just the motion of unlocking the gate COULD HAVE created the space smaller, pinching into our son's wrist even more. THERE ARE NO WARNINGS ON THIS GATE ABOUT SMALL CHILDREN GETTING THEIR HANDS OR FEET STUCK.  It is common sense though and one would think that a child would be able to bring their hand back out. But because he got it between the end where the gates overlap, the area was smaller.  I see the far edges are smaller too.  I wouldn't even trust this gate for an animal.  I will be calling the company the next business day.
B0009J3QI0|1|This mobile is a wind up mobile, so the music only lasts for a very short time. As soon as she was entertained it stopped playing. I went to Walmart and bought a battery operated mobile that was more brightly colored and I didn't have to rewind it every minute. It's pretty, but was not worth the purchase.
B005IWNNK4|4|this is an awesome baby monitor.  I like the versatility and controls via the base unit.  the night vision mode is OK, but it probably could use more powerful IR lights because the range is only about 5 feet, beyond that it gets very dark.  I wish it had auto-focus to sharpen the image and height adjustment would be sweet.
B000BPMJR6|1|It only last few wash.
B004V8VQC8|5|We've got a 2 month old and purchased this after a friends little one got it. Our daughter loves it. From the first day we placed her down on it she's been hooked.<br /><br />The keyboard buttons I think could be a little bit softer, our little one kicks pretty hard and sometimes I worry about her bruising her little feet. Other than that though it's solid enough to take her beating on it so far.<br /><br />The hanging pieces are the usual plastic construction with varying actions to them. The hanging mirror has been a nice addition and usually keeps her interest for a bit.<br /><br />Being able to adjust the overhanging pieces, as well as lay it down for tummy time has been nice as well.<br /><br />I would suggest this piece to other parents. Shipment was delivered in a reasonable time with no damage or issues. WOuld buy from this seller again.
B002G5I0YK|3|I actually bought these \\"on the road\\". My daughter and I were travelling in my mother's car, and while packing I had forgotten to detach my sunshades and transfer them to her car.<br /><br />Definitely do not go out of your way to buy them for every day use. However, they are nice for travel.<br /><br />These shades can fold or roll up to fit a small space. To attach you basically press them to the window, as they are a cling film. They won't smooth out but they did stick for awhile. After some time the bottom (with the useless heat button -- if its \\"lit\\" then it FEELS HOT in the car. Some common sense renders those obsolete.) tended to detach and swing free.<br /><br />Overall, I can see how this would be nice to pack in a diaper bag for traveling with an infant (if you were going to be in a very sunny cab or something for a long time, or visiting someone's house and planning to move the baby carrier car seat around.) However, the baby seat sunshade canopy that is usually attached to most infant car seats is much more useful.<br /><br />If you need to block out bright sun while driving long distances like we do, buy the ones that clip over the window top or use suction cups. At least with those you can usually press a button and retract the sunshade.<br /><br />With the cling film you will need to remove the whole thing to roll the windows down.
B00GS1H0YO|5|This chair has worked out well.  I bought it for visiting grandchildren.  It doesn't take up as much space as larger models, and is easily moved when I want to give the grand baby a &#34;starter&#34; for his breakfast while I am cooking in the kitchen.  It is easy for him to sit in it while I am working in the kitchen then easily moved into the dining room with him in it.
B00DDUM1CY|5|Love it
B0014C54NG|5|I have been looking for a Photo frame for my daughters first communion for 2 years. There were several to choose from but I wanted one to match her brothers. This is the closest I found that had a big enough picture area.
B009SYEVXG|5|This are really cute. It is exactly just the in the picture.
B00BUGQ6VK|5|This bib is really amazing. It makes eating time less stressful and fun. I know what to get my mom friends for Christmas.
B007F21F1O|5|This is a very comfortable carrier and not too expensive! My son is 20 lbs and he is light as feather in this thing. One con is that the straps are a little too short, but it's not that big of a deal.
B000GYP9MO|5|It's super cute but it's HUGE!!! He will eventually grow into it so I guess it's okay!
B0035JL93K|2|I tired a smaller size first and they were too big still.  My son peed right through them to my jeans where he was sitting on my lap.  This pants were dry even though I was wet and my son was too.  I was able to return these with no problem!
B005EJEWYW|5|Got these for camping and haven't had a chance to use them yet.  The looked to be packaged nicely and I'm sure they will be very useful.
B00H9KR27I|4|I think they work pretty well. Smell is reduced significantly, using two taped inside lid and one in bottom.
B00I90HURY|5|My little girl loves this. She was not a fan of her car seat if awake so we started to put this with her when in her car seat and she just loves it and doesn't cry in her car seat much at all as long as she has this with her. She is 11months now and still in love with her monkey blanket !!
B0007D8G4W|1|Had the same problem as others, it's not the deluxe version. Please correct the description, it's about time you did
B000BXHPEU|2|Not sure why everyone loves this so much. I used it a couple of times with my son, but the seat was a bit awkward for him, it doesn't have a splash guard and many times would sort of fall off the toilet when he climbed off. We've stopped using it.
B003TJ9P64|5|I bought this way back for my nephew and he liked it. We all liked it. Though it is bit pricey, i will recommend it. And it is durable too.
B007ZRVMC6|5|So far so good. But can't fold it back to the red bag what came with the cover. :(
B00BWLPDLW|5|I love this product so much! My son rolls around a lot at night and I have watched him from the monitor hitting his head on the fabric, and he didn't even wake up. My only disappointment was that the number of bumpers was reduced (either by Go Mama at the factory or Amazon), and you can tell by the packaging - it said &#34;36&#34; bumpers were inside, but the &#34;36&#34; was covered with a piece of tape that said &#34;24&#34; instead. I am just a little annoyed that there was a thought for 36 pieces, because that would have made sense! The bumpers will only cover the 12 side slats and not the head or foot board - you have to buy 12 more, hence why 36 would have been ideal for the price. However, the bumpers still get five stars for easy installation, great colors, and safety for babies! Woo hoo!
B0065LTW52|4|I recently had my first baby and was excited to try the Simplisse Double Electric pump.  Unlike others, I had never tried another pump so I have nothing to compare this one to.  However, I found the pump very comfortable and easy to use.  There was no pulling, tugging or pain during the pumping process and felt very similar to my baby nursing.  The pump is very straight forward and easy to use, but being a first-time mom and pumper, it took me a bit to figure out the best settings for optimum results.  It's a bit noisy, but as I said before, I have no other experience to compare it to.  I would recommend this pump to anyone.
B003TSDMH8|2|First off I will say that I do like the design/shape of this pillow.... minus the bumps, which is supposed to be where the babys head goes or something?.... but this item is sooooo cheaply made.  I actually thought I had received a knock off because at first glance the fabric quality is super poor.  I looked up the name of the company online since mistakenly thought it was called the Breast Friend and my 'Brest Friend' was a fake.... but I was wrong, it is the real thing.  The foam inside is the kind that will just flake apart, cheaper than a dollar store sponge... and it stinks like chemicals very badly.  I can imagine actually using it, as you could never wash the foam and there is no waterproof barier to keep from this foam from soaking with breast milk or whatever.  Or being able to wash the cover and put back on the foam without it all falling apart.  Also the fabric they use also is like a cheap Wal-Mart type quality.  Not made to last AT ALL.  It is quite a shame since it felt like a great fit, and I liked the clip and pocket.  I could never use it with my baby though, it off gasses and just isn't worth the money I paid.  I am returning this today and looking for something with higher quality materials, as this is not something I will lay my newborn on.
B002YQQQJW|2|When I saw these on line they looked like the perfect product for making and freezing my own baby food.  While they are the perfect size and I love the stackable storage system, the only drawback is that the lids don't stay on - it's a pretty major drawback. They aren't easy to put into place and don't freeze well.  Seems that when they're frozen with a baby puree in them they don't hold the seal at all.  And if it comes loose you can't secure it again.  So I'm not able to send my food with my baby to daycare, I'm only able to use them at home.  Unfortunately I don't recommend this product if you're planning on using them to send off in a diaper bag with your baby to daycare.  :(
B00674S1Y0|5|We've used this through 2 children, now and it's still going strong.  This fits well over most toilet seats and we've never had an issue with shifting or tipping over.  The handles are great if your little one gets scared sitting up high on the potty.<br /><br />The guard in front has worked well with my son (no splashes), and it's comfortable enough for them to sit a long time.  I put a Command Hook on the cabinet next to the toilet to hang on when not in use.  It doesn't take up much room at all.  I clean it once a week with some water and bleach and it still looks new.<br /><br />I recommend having at least one of these, if not one for each of your toilets.<br /><br />It is better than the smaller toddler potties we've tried as it take up no room when in use, and makes the transition to a big potty much easier.  We have a small foldable step stool beside the potty so they can climb up and have a foot rest.
B003XMWF2S|4|My grandchildren love Sesame Street and Elmo.  This toddler set is fun for dinner time.  The only thing that can be problematic is that smaller hands have a little more trouble with the grip around Elmo's share.  My older grandchildren don't have that problem.
B000GFP3A6|3|This is a very cute wooden wind up toy. The feet and winder are plastic so not very durable if a kid is rough.  Part of the foot has a small piece of plastic that could break off easily.  Mine actually broke in shipping.  I could see this getting broken and swallowed easily by a baby/toddler.
B0010BQ6LK|5|We bought this car seat for my first baby and he was just so tiny. He fit comfortably in this seat with the back adjusted to the smallest height. It is cushioned well and the padding on the seat belt part held his little neck perfectly. It is such a comfortable seat for him. The safety bar is an excellent feature. While talking with a car seat specialist at the hospital, she told me this was one of the best seats you can buy for safety because of that bar. While the child is in the seat you are also suppose to leave the handle up on this seat. I couldnt find the instructions manual on this seat when it came to my house...but after searching this seat, it is located on the back under the canopy...A convenient little pocket for the manual in case you should ever need it. The only thing I absolutely hate about this seat is the canopy. It does not stay up. Every time I carry my baby anywhere in this, it always falls down. Sun, rain, snow..you name it, it gets in his eyes. This seat would be perfect if the canopy would stay up. Everybody always complements me on how nice it looks. It snaps in easily to the base and is easy to get out.
B00K317X1U|1|Awful! Stopped working in the middle of the night- can I rate zero stars?!
B00EI6DAV8|2|Bassinet looked great until arrival and is missing the leg pieces. Pretty dissatisfied especially seeing as I'm due anytime now.
B000067K0L|5|We got this as a gift and we use it for our daughter every now and then. She loves pulling the toys attached to it especially the monkey and the parrot. She also likes to kick the music pad and can spend atleast 30-45 minutes on the gym mat when music turns on and off. Recently she has started turning over her tummy and now she also likes watching herself in the mirror. Great product and very good choice of colors.
B00GLFQLMO|5|Very clear and my son loves seeing himself in the mirror
B00D2YYN2M|5|Fit as expected.
B00G5JK244|3|I didn't like the way it collapse, but it is a good size. It's not too heavy and it can hold up a lot of dirty laundry.
B005FEOV88|5|This is just what we needed! We are using them as goldendoodle beds, attached to our own bed under the mattress. The dogs go right into them and stay there all night. They can sleep with us but we still have all of our room. Attractive and easy to assemble. I put a king sized pillow over the mattress and used the provided sheet on the pillow. The dogs slept through the night in it the very first night.
B0088N4CUA|5|My 20 month old loves it and so do I. Haven't taken it on our trip yet but we do own other Skip Hop items that have held up very well. I originally planned on getting the Skip Hop Zoo Safety Harness but with comparison between the two the backpack it is just slightly larger. My daughter is 34 in tall and the bag sits just slightly over her bottom ( but it's not overwhelming on her ) . I plan on adding my own harness that can detach ( to be used only at our international airport) It's always crazy busy there.<br /><br />FYI: If you don't care about brands you can get JiaYou Unisex Baby Kid Casual PU Bag Daypack Animal Style Schoolbags Backpack for about half the price. I don't know the quality but ran across it when I was looking for a matching rolling luggage for the skip hop backpack.
B00073HJG8|1|Claimed jumbo, but this thing wasn't any bigger than maybe 2 feet!
B007Y75G0G|5|This was a great buy!  As a child care owner of thirteen years, I find products like this a &#34;must have&#34;.  Especially with consideration  to the good quality and affordable price of an item like this.  The children get excited, learn faster, easier, and have fun with this hands on, open-ended activity.
B002O3NLIO|5|I love all of the Lifefactory stuff we have and will be sad when the baby outgrows it all.  We have Dr. Brown's nipples as well and they don't compare.  These aren't flimsy and they hold up great to daily use.
B002B55AC0|5|I love the easy to use design and the &#34;catcher&#34; is genius. It stops most of the mess from hitting the floor. Great for restaurants and eating over at friends.
B0052GM9S8|2|My baby is about to born. I will say this is very useful when i am going to do my breast feeding. the only problem is that one of them came in crack so i ended up have to throw it away. I think next time you guys should do a better protection on the package.
B005FIVBFU|4|I was so worried that the sofa would be too small for my twins. They just turned two and fit perfectly, with room to grow. It was delivered quickly and undamaged. I would say the one downfall is that it is not build sturdy as I would have liked, for the price. The UPS guy was able to carry it over his shoulder with one arm. I picked it up expecting it to be heavy, but it was extremely light. The fabric is really nice, and can be cleaned easily. However the padding is very thin and uneven. My girls have had it for two days and their butt prints are already seen. I did go for a set that I could redo later, however I don't think the structure will outlast the fabric. For now my girls love it and there doesn't seem to be any defects on it.
B000WJLKQM|5|This jumper rocks, seriously.  We were able to put my son in it at about 15/16 weeks (he's tall) and even then he had fun bouncing a little.  Now at 22 weeks, he goes to town on it.  It's super easy to clip to the top of the doorframe, and I never see any damage from the pressure of the clip.  And it's so light and easy to clip, I take it around the house.  I clip it in the door near the kitchen when I'm doing dishes (ha! or rather, eating over the sink) and in the bathroom door when I'm getting ready for work in the morning.  The bumpers keep damage to the door, and keep him safe.<br /><br />My only complaint is the height thing.  We've got ours as high as it can go, and I worry we won't be able to use it much longer if he gets much taller very soon.  My son's not crazy tall, the 75% percentile at his 4 month visit, but his feet still touch the ground on the highest setting.  But until he gets too tall, he loves it.
B00K2RXMUQ|5|This bag is awesome!! Perfect for airline travel with 5 year old and infant! It fit everything I needed, and still had room - and there are a bunch of accessories that I didn't even use - but were also great! I used this bag with an infant carrier, and I still found it to be quite comfortable. The cooler seemed a little small - but I didn't use it yet so I can't really give it a review! Thus far I have nothing but positive things to say about it! If you are looking for a backpack style diaper bag, this one is definitely worth the money!
B000XT30G4|5|Great! We love it!!! I would recommend this gate to anyone with young children. It is sturdy and holds up to the little monkeys climbing on it too!
B001CDFPY0|5|we use these for our changing area on our pack and play and it fits perfect!
B003TJACAC|4|I've been using this bag for a few days now, and I have to say that I really, really like it.  My basic requirements for a bag are that I can wear it as a backpack, it would have pockets to accommodate 4 beverages (sippies/bottles), and it would have a full zipper at the top, since I tend to sling bags around, or bend over a lot, etc. This bag not only meets these requirements, it also has the added bonus of the pull-out drawer, which is truly the absolutely best part.  I currently have 2 young boys and am always throwing things like snack bars, pretzels, grapes, and bananas in my bag, which end up smooshed and crumbled, and therefore wasted.  The drawer completely elimininates this problem.  I'm currently pregnant with #3, so I knew I would need to be able to carry at least 2 bottles and the boys' sippies without them tipping over and spilling, so I'm thrilled at all the beverage pockets.  I would give this bag a 5, but I do find it a tad large, but, as a friend pointed out, I'm about to be using this bag for 3 children, instead of just 2.  There are a few tweaks I would make in order to make this the #1 perfect bag for me, like padded straps when in backpack mode, a grab handle for the top, a bigger \\"mom\\" pouch for my personal things, since I don't carry a separate purse, and maybe different fabric options (I have the Elite Pearl, which is fun and fabulous, but perhaps a tad too ostentatious for my taste), but these are just ideas, and do not at all affect the function and practicalness of the bag, which is absolutely what every mother needs in a diaper bag.  I've spent the past 4 years using crappy, unorganized, catch-all bags that I hated and would frustrate me, so I am elated that I finally have a bag that I'm excited about because it makes my day a little easier.
B0042G8YCY|4|Beeds are very small
B00IMF2IUA|4|I really like this bottle brush. It last a long time and I like that the nipple brush screws into the bottom of the main. Super convenient. It's nice that this came as a set with the straw cleaning brushes, considering that I needed to purchase both.
B002JH9D7I|5|Diaper bag is just what I was expecting. All around happy with this purchase - shipping, price and expectation. I was looking for something a little girlie but not too girlie for daddy to carry around when he has his darling daughter - this is perfect! Can't wait to start using it
B001OC5UMQ|5|Gates are of high quality
B0039YP27U|3|I bought this and the KidKraft Two Step Stool; one for a downstairs/high-use bathroom and one for upstairs/non-guests. The KidKraft one is awesome for my 18mo old as it gets him to a good height to wash his hands at the sink. This one, however, we're going to have to wait to use for awhile because it is too short and he can't reach the sink. I'm hoping within a year he'll be able to use it. Maybe we can use it when he starts to potty-train and ever needs to get up to the regular-sized toilet? Not sure. The stool itself seems sturdy enough and has nonslip tips, so I think it will be good once he gets older/taller. (He is a typical-size/height toddler.)
B00LIRIZVU|5|I crazy love this little guy.  It holds just enough food for lunch, it's easy to clean, and I have warm food when I can't get to a microwave.
B00A475DRO|5|Just great. Very convenient in feeding and no mess! Instead of holding spoon and a jar - just have this and feed your baby. No mess!
B0058CT68M|5|We purchased this when expecting our first child and it made organizing the closet a breeze. Bonus, very easy to install. We loved it so much, we purchased another now that we are expecting baby number 2.
B004JM8XCC|3|We were looking for a 2nd car seat base for my when the opportunity to review this infant seat came along so I decided to go with a second full seat instead of just the base.<br /><br />I agree with the previous reviewers: There are some great features, it's very safe but this seat is too big and heavy.<br /><br />I'm a fairly strong, 5'10\\" woman and I have to say that the First Years seat is a serious upper body workout.<br />Miraculously, it fits in the backseat of my Mini Clubman with enough space for me to sit comfortably in the passenger front seat. However, it's so heavy and unwieldy that it's hard work getting it in and out with a baby in it. (The Clubman has a 3rd door that widens the passenger side opening for easy in-and-out of the backseat.) When my infant is facing forward, in a year or 2, the weight will be a non-issue because I'll just leave the seat in the car. (***Edit: This seat won't convert to forward facing.) Unfortunately I can't get her in and out of the rear-facing configuration without removing the seat from the car. I also worry that the baby plus the seat will weigh more than I can comfortably/safely move in and out before it's time to turn the seat around. (Hopefully my muscles will grow with my baby!) Maybe no one else tries to move kids around in less than a 4-door sedan anymore...<br /><br />If you do need to maneuver this seat in and out of a tight space, think carefully about how much weight you can lift and adjust. Once I get the seat into the back of the car, I then have to do smaller adjustments to get it onto the base correctly, which the physics of levers turns into more work.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Heavy duty construction<br />- Actually easy to install the base! Really!<br />- Well padded with thick foam and high-quality material<br />- Easy to adjust straps! (I wish we'd gotten this one first just for the ease of adjusting the shoulder straps!)<br />- Rebound handle position so that the seat stays put better in a crash<br />- Cute, attractive print without being gender-specific<br />- Spots to put pictures or labels which I will find handy when I bring it to the gym's childcare room<br />- All that weight amounts to what seems to be a great, safe, seriously engineered car seat<br />- There's an option to strap this seat in without the base (I haven't tried it but it seems like it would be handy when traveling)<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Weight. It's just too big and heavy for easy maneuvering for most people<br />- Under the padding there are some straight edges of plastic that bother me - the other seat we have has curved edges in the same place but is not as thickly padded. I guess it's a trade off<br />- Size<br />- Canopy when down can interfere with the handle to release the seat from the base<br />- Did I mention that it's heavy?<br /><br />Edited to add, after 9-ish months of use:<br />Pros:<br />- Very solid. I've been very happy with the stability of this seat.<br />- The ease of strap adjustment is still great enough to mention again!<br />- Now that she's older (after 5 months), we've gotten good at getting in and out of the rear-facing seat in the back of the Clubman without removing it from the car.<br />Cons:<br />- I did have to put a phone book under it to get it to level out properly. Part of this is due to the slope of the seat in my car rather than the car seat itself.<br />- Hot/it doesn't breathe. My daughter comes out of this seat sweaty and hot after long rides.<br />- Still heavy but, hey, I'm getting stronger.Cute, attractive print without being gender-specific<br />- Spots to put pictures or labels which I will find handy when I bring it to the gym's childcare room<br />- All that weight amounts to what seems to be a great, safe, seriously engineered car seat<br />- There's an option to strap this seat in without the base (I haven't tried it but it seems like it would be handy when traveling)<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Weight.

B00440CZVY|1|I hated these cups.  I don't know what I was doing wrong, but I had the hardest time assembling them in such a way that even I could suck more than a few drops of water from the cup.
B009WPUMXE|4|It is made in the US. If you like to avoid using plastic bottle, I guess this is the best option. I rarely use this product because of my right hand. It is little heavy and my right hand has not been in a good condition after the nurse hit the nerves trying to put an IV when I was in the delivery room.
B007A2ZP6K|2|These work for child proofing door handles but the majority of handles I have make it difficult for adults to open. My fingers get pinched trying to turn the handle.
B004AP9YJO|5|This bag could easily be mistaken for a Kate Spade. This bag is absolutly adorable, functional, spacious, and durable. Its hard to tell from the pictures but the material on the outside is almost as smooth as leather so everything wipes off! There are hooks on the inside for each attachment to a stroller. Great gift for a mother-to-be or for yourself. You cannot go wrong with this diaper bag!
B003XMWF2S|5|Niece enjoyed very much.
B001N44UX0|5|I purchased this gate to keep my twins in the living room area, out of the dining room and it is perfect! Very sturdy and easy to open and close for adults!
B007TTIRUU|4|I was anxious to try these bottles, because I had heard that this style made it much easier for babies to switch between bottles and nursing.  My new baby did not care for the nipple on this bottle.  I'm not sure what was going on with it, but she seemed to have a problem getting a \\"latch\\" on it and controlling the flow.  Even with the \\"slowest\\" nipple on the bottle, she still gagged and choked on the milk that was pouring out.  I did check to make sure that all of the parts were in place properly, which may have led to the milk coming out too fast.  I do like the wider opening on the bottles, which makes it easier to clean.  I have used these bottles several times, and sterilized them several times and there has been no adverse effects to the bottle as far as I can tell.  I have heard good things about these bottles, so I don't want to write them off too quickly.  Once I return to work, if I find that I need to supplement with formula I will give these bottles another try. Perhaps the thicker consistency of formula will come out of the nipple more slowly, and also once my baby is older/bigger, she may be able to control the flow of milk better.  Overall, the quality of these bottles seems to be good, and hopefully my baby will learn to like/use them.
B000JVXZF2|1|This was a waste of money. I bought it for the grandparent's home and when I went there I realized that the item is of poor quality
B00KM60D3Q|1|I have had 2 of their products. 6 years ago I bought one and loved it, great picture.  I bought another last year and its a complete piece of junk. Its like the dont even use the same technology and the picture is terrible cant even tell yhere is a body in the crib..
B001DWEL3G|4|This rocking chair is perfect for my baby's room!  It is very comfortable to sit in.
B00PL1KV70|5|I love the Happy Mat. It is so easy to use and it sticks to my kitchen table which sadly is loosing its finish and I thought this might not stick but it did. It is so nice that my daughter can not throw this like she can plates for fun. It is also microwavable safe and dishwasher safe. I plan on getting more in the future as well as some of their other mats that they are coming out with. It is well worth the price. Plus it is a family run company that gives back to others, which makes it even more worth it for me.
B00IQBQIHY|5|very nice
B002DWALTI|5|This activity mat is adorable.  It says for boy, but I think it's unisex.<br />It's lightweight and love how it folds away for storage.  The patterns used are eye catching.<br />Two cons:<br />It's hard to collect the material together when it's folded in order to strap the Velcro together.  The Velcro strips are way tiny.<br />The mat itself is a slick material, so when baby is on tummy, he can't get any traction with his legs and feet.<br />Even with those &#34;negatives&#34;, I still give it 5 stars.  It's lovely!
B001KZH67Y|5|I've bought two of these so far. They fit the Graco Pack and Play as well as my Arm's reach Co-Sleeper.  The material is soft, and I realized after purchasing that the material is perfect because it does not feel cold to the touch - putting a sleeping baby down on plain cold cotton sheets can be a challenge but these feel soft and flannely and therefore warm. I've been using them ~2 months so far and I've no complaints!
B002JP47LM|5|I have a sweet little swaddle buster with long arms and legs (21\\" at birth).  She grew out of receiving blankets quickly, and can bust out of a velcro swaddle faster than you can say Houdini.  These blankets are cool enough to use during summer, and large enough to tuck once you have wrapped your baby up!  Awesome for the die hard traditional swaddlers who do not like velcro or miracle blankets. LOVE 'EM!
B007NG5UF4|5|Works great. I was worried cause we already have two other monitors in the house. One is a very old model Safety First and the other is a super cheapo Gracco picked up new from Wally world. We just had a third child and I like having one in each bedroom. I get absolutely no interference on this one. I also like the talk back - it's very nice to have and something neither of our others have. We have the other two set on alternate channels (A and B) but there is nowhere to select one on this unit - I think it just picks up the strongest available, which is cool. I'd probably know more about how it works if I took the time to read the insert, but with a 3 yr old, 16 month old and newborn - I just don't have them time. I love ordering gadgets that just plug and play and this one does just that.
B00A69H9U4|1|Not good material.
B00FFSR5HI|3|I think this is Thirsties' most basic diaper cover:  it has velcro but no snaps. It isn't as adjustable, but with the leg gussets, it still doesn't leak. Regardless, I can't get over how rough the material is. Obviously the baby mostly feels a cloth insert next to his skin, but I just can't seem to find a way to position this diaper so that my baby's skin isn't rubbed at least a little bit raw around the leg holes. I've had this problem with two kids now (and with Thirsties' covers with AND without snaps), and it's just frustrating.<br /><br />I will say that these diaper covers are extremely light and easy to clean. If your baby has only peed a little bit, you can even just replace the insert and keep the same cover. (Is that gross?) This is a distinct advantage over my still-favorite cloth diaper, ([[ASIN:B002SWK6A2 Fuzzi Bunz One Size Cloth Diapers 6 Pack Gender Neutral Colors]]), where you have to change the entire diaper EVERY time. But, then again, Fuzzi Bunz diapers are softer and don't irritate my baby's skin, so that's a trade-off I'm willing to make.<br /><br />Ultimately, finding the \\"right\\" cloth diaper really does take some trial and error. Every kid is different, and you have to figure out what works best for you and your kid.
B0002U1SFE|5|My 6 month old son loved this from the first moment he was in it.  When he pushes the animal buttons enough times to get it to play a song he grins from ear to ear.  He plays with all the toys but loves to chew on the sun and star.
B000CSBP9K|5|got this for son when he does his art classes it is great planning on getting another for home
B0035LLG2W|4|Works for what I need it for
B0053ZD2IY|5|Great Idea, very practical and sturdy and easy to wash.

B0026O772W|5|Completed the nursery.
B000K05XO8|5|I ordered this set from another site because they had free shipping. The bedding arrived today and it is sooo much prettier than in the pictures. I LOVE it! We have white furniture and the colors really pop next to it. It seems to be of good quality. Baby isn't here yet so I do not know how well it wears but I am inclined to think it will last. I ordered the mobile, fuzzy blanket, and car seat insert. They are all very cute and I am happy I got them. I also love that this set includes the diaper stacker and valance, both of which are adorable. I really think this is a spectacular set for the money! Happy shopping!
B0041EJ822|1|Very disappointed their packing. I saw every parts for Phil and Teds stroller were not in the plastic bag at all and all parts were so messed in the box. Plus first I opened the box stroller footwell had a crack. When I reported this as claim to Phi&Teds customer service, they told me they are not resposible for this claim. Retailer HealthCheck Systems told they are getting footwell part and forward it on to me. It has been over 2 months but no response from HealthCheck Systems. I will never purchase anything from Phil and Teds and their retailer HealthCheck Systems.
B004LWZZ76|5|My 10 month old granddaughter loves these and there is no place for mold to collect on these, like the squeeze toys do.
B00LC3MFRA|1|Who sells 25 bags for that price? Are you kidding me? 625 count would make more sense.
B001RJUVS4|5|I really like the Munchie Mug! I was a bit concerned as I read some previous reviews that the quality was really bad, but I went ahead and ordered 2 anyway. Well, the quality isn't the best around (not Tupperware quality), but it isn't as bad as what some reviewers described. I can see how the cover or non-spill cover could crack if one screwed it on too tightly. The plastic isn't very thick. But I don't see it as a problem. I just had to remember to screw the cover on gently. Maybe my kids are a bit older (4 and 6), but I appreciate the bigger container as compared to something small like the Snack Trap (which we used when the kids were much younger). With the Munchie Mug, the cheerios could last for a whole day outing without running out. I would say that the quality of the non-spill lid is better than the snack trap's. With the Snack Trap, the non-spill lid would fall off if my kid pulled on it or tried to pull his hand back out of the lid if he inserted his hand too far in, but there is no risk of the cover falling off unless the kid unscrews the lid. Overall, I'm happy with the Munchie Mugs. I just wish they were a bit cheaper!
B007A2ZP6K|5|These were super easy to install and work like a charm!  One went on my toddlers bedroom door and the other on the bathroom door.  See, typically in the morning my child will bolt to the bathroom and dig thru my makeup case.  Painting a bright assortment of colors all over my bathroom mirror.  The day after I installed these I woke up to a loud SHRIEK coming from my 2 year old ... &#34;Momma! Door broke!&#34; with little tears running down her face.  I won't lie, I giggled ... then responded &#34;yes baby, the door is broke!&#34;.  She walks by the door each day and tries to open it with no luck!  Thanks for saving me hundreds of dollars in replacing ruined makeup!
B00KHR82FQ|5|Great chair. NOT for stand-alone use. Use it as intended and it's a great booster that's easy to store or transport.
B00T6XZBV0|5|This monitor is great for the price. Has good night vision.
B00XAWQN9W|5|Got to try this for a reduce price and in return I would provide an host review; easy to install just stick to the window and thats it; these truly are great sun shades if you have little ones in the car.
B003Q4OMMO|5|Good changing bag.
B008WHM1AK|5|I bought this from seller's website, about the same $. The shipping was fast and the product is great. My son just turned 5 months old and is grasping and nothing everything. We've only used thud in the carseat a couple times but it's been great. We no longer have to stretch and search in the seat to find the pacifier or teething toys, my son can easily see them grab them.
B00C8OSBQ6|5|go glass, dishwasher safe is a huge help to parents who are busy
B00HURF2KE|1|Very Dissatisfied<br /><br />I barely used the tub for 2 months. My baby was 6lbs at that time. I kept the baby on the sling n it suddenly snapped and the baby fell in the tub. i will strongly suggest not to buy this product and that the makers should pay more attention on the safety feature
B0006FHB92|4|My son and daughter-in-law requested this item and they are very pleased with it.
B008LWPVXA|5|Love it
B00821Q9LI|3|Baby loves this it is a great combination of soft and harder textures.  Easy for a 4 month old to get ahold of.  Rather expensive for what it is.  Actually found a better one later that she likes more.
B000S35QLC|3|mostly ok.  other electronic devices (cell phones, ipad, wireless phone) seem to interfere with it often, causing static and other loud noises.  battery doesn't last as long as I had hoped.  Will usually make it through the night, IF you charge it fully though beforehand.  Definetly doesn't last 2 nights without a charging.<br />The microphone in the base unit is pretty sensitive, so I have no complaints there.
B00A5DQFWE|1|Items arrived totally different than shown.  This was BROWN and pink, not black as shown in the pictures.
B0019UG62Q|5|great gripping action..color goes nicely with my bathroom decor..feel safe taking a shower anytime I feel like it...great great grreat
B0006HBS1M|5|good
B00AX9EEUA|5|I don't even know where to start, I love this book so much! As a first time parent this book helped me to learn to make my own baby food! The information and recipes in this book have been endlessly helpful! Highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to make their own baby food.
B005HJ2CWS|5|Exactly as expected
B000XA6DC6|2|Hard to handle this bag once the car seat is in it.  If you are checking your car seat I guess it's a good cover but I used this to drag it around the airport and it was tricky to get it to balance right to pull & then when turning it would tip over.  Not cool when I had a baby & stroller to deal with.  Ended up putting car seat in stroller for transport & strapping baby on me.
B00AJF7QIK|4|This was exactly what I had hoped, a bright color so it stood out when we are searching all over for it and helps keep the pacifier in place.  Also helps her older brother know it is not one of his.
B00CXV0HPM|4|It's on the larger end for fitting, my baby is 8 months old and just now fitting into it. It leaks, but all cloth diapers leak (don't even lie to me, I bought one of every single brand to try them out.) I like this product but I won't be buying this brand again due to cost- I get the same quality and effectiveness from Alva brand and they're much more affordable.
B00KXY8NZW|4|Keeps drinks cold all day long and cleaning is a breeze. It has a slower flow compared to other sippy cups. Also, we've found that if we overtighten the lid, nothing comes out at all.
B000F1OAE6|5|Never have had any problems! Not the easiest to clean, but safety is my number 1 priority and this is it!
B004MDL5U0|5|Some people seem to really hate this, but I bought this seat for my baby before she was born on the advice of multiple parents who'd used it and liked it.  It's nice and small, but my daughter just turned one year old and is currently 22 lbs, almost 30&#34;, and she still fits in it.  She's about to outgrow it length-wise, but we may keep her in it a little longer, since she's not uncomfortable in the slightest.  I love the adjustable back--the knob is easy to turn to move the straps up and down.  It goes down to 5 lbs, where some infant seats only go down to 8 lbs, and it goes up to 30 lbs, where some only go to 20 or 25.  I liked this one in the store because it felt like the lightest seat to pick up by the handle, which is important to me as I'm small and I have one bad shoulder.  A heavy seat could've been a dealbreaker in the beginning.  The handle is also nicely ergonomic.  We never intended to have a stroller but we bought the Baby Trend jogging stroller to go with this and let me tell you, we use it all the time.  It handles like a dream.  I don't know about the regular stroller, but if you want a stroller with this seat, you can't go wrong with the jogger.<br /><br />After one year of use, the seat looks surprisingly clean and not at all like the milk-and-Goldfish mess it should look like.<br /><br />As far as some of the complaints, we have had the straps twist from time to time, and it's a bit difficult to untwist them.  Other reviewers have indicated that other seats don't have this problem--I'll believe it when I see it.  Regarding difficulties tightening it down, pulling the strap on the front does tend to tighten one shoulder strap more than the other, but you can grab the hip straps and pull on the tighter side to take up the slack from the looser side and then pull the front strap again.  I've never found it to cause problems.<br /><br />Installation is very easy, and, besides the fact that it has a 20-pound, squirming baby in it, I find that getting the seat on and off the base is also a cinch.
B0012OYEOG|4|These come with nice little plastic covers to keep on when not in use. Can't wait to try them out on my little one.
B00020L78M|5|I have used this gate system for multiple children. Love that it can be expanded, lightweight and collapsible, easy set up and take down, very sturdy. Great price!
B003HC8622|5|Bought this for my grandson. So far, he loves being in the walker. The activity fold-in sides are fantastic and the play items keep him busy. We are very happy with this purchase.
B00G1MEISG|5|Truly non leaking and loved by my baby boy bottle .Very small amount of air gets in his stomach also!!!!
B009UPUJIY|2|These are really soft but they're too soft!  You go to shove a diaper under your baby and the whole liner gets all bunched up underneath.  I would not buy again and will reluctantly use these when the Boppy ones are dirty.
B0017JQPUM|5|Nice quality!
B005OI8OCY|5|Love these chewy rings!  The baby loves them too. :). She's been a fan since she was around 3 months old...and continues to chew on them now. We've ordered a couple different sets.
B004B762AK|5|I love this monitor set. I love that you can pan the camera from the remote & see the entire bedroom. Its great.
B004CLYYV4|5|super cute, love the quantity for the money.
B002SZT35S|5|We bought this for a 50&#34; plasma (samsung) that we have on a stand.  Screws provided fit, put into two studs and the tv is not going anywhere.  Easy install. Overall happy.
B000S9POMM|4|I bought this stroller with my 3 year old grandson in mind.  He is a tall boy and his other strollers had become tight for him.  We often take trips and still need a stroller for a tired boy.  This stroller fits the bill!  It is large enough for him to have headroom with the hood opened.  When you are 3 you are a big boy and  a stroller seems like a babyish thing, but when you are asleep on your feet it sure feels good to get off of them!  It will even ride his 6 year old sister in a pinch! The best part is how light it is. I have no trouble carrying it around when my big boy insists he is too old and can walk! It is sturdy for a trifold and easy to push.
B000RFBW00|5|Awesome drying rack and easy to clean ! Great for travel or everyday use ! Love it !
B0012E4FV8|3|Cumbersome to use - You have to bother the people on the row behind you to to put it on and off as they have to move their tray.<br />Don't fit toddlers well - The straps are too long and won't adjust short enough for my 2 1/2 year old.<br />Very expensive - This should be half the cost for the incredibly small amount of materials, most of the cost is probably for the exclusive FAA certificate.<br />It will probably be more handy when my kid gets a little taller. Plus I had him carry it in his own little luggage that he loved to pull behind him like us.
B004N7D57Q|5|What a great way to bless a new born baby with this precious cross! Although I did not get it for a baptism, I purchased it for a great grandson as a reminder of our love for him through Jesus Christ, our Savior and Lord.  We may not be here when he grows up, but we will leave our witness with him through this lovely cross.
B0077M41Z4|5|Cleans nicely. Very reasonable price. I am glad I brought this to clean my sons straw bottles. It fits perfectly in the straws and cleans deeply
B009UPUC36|5|My 14 month old loves this little nightlight.  We use it when we are traveling.  It's cute, it provides just enough light, and it turns off after a set amount of time.
B00OJMAHPS|5|Love this product. I have a very nice stroller that was a gift which is made of white leather so this bag did its job during my recent travels.
B002GAY07Q|5|the production is very good. my friend is very love it . i want it better packing. very like it
B00186ZQUO|5|After having to switch my son to formula I learned how big of a pain it is to warm up bottles. I refuse to use the microwave, I don't want hot spots or for the plastic of my expensive Tommee Tippee Sensitive Tummy bottles to break down. At first I did it the old fashioned way...a hot pot of water on the stove. But it takes so long for the water to get hot enough to warm the bottle and it's really annoying to constantly have a pot of water sitting on the stove. It's also a different floor than the nursery is so it was an even bigger pain in the middle of the night. Then my mom got me one of these....it's heaven sent! Sure, it's loud, but my son quickly got used to the beeping, and now knows when he hears the beep he's about to get food so he calms down if he's fussing. Plus it only takes about a minute, so by the time we're done with a diaper change, it's ready to go! I love being able to sanitize pacifiers and nipples in it as well. I'm now buying another one...to keep from having to run downstairs if we're upstairs, and to get rid of that darn pot of water on the stove that annoys me...and that the cats drink out of lol!
B004L2JJ6E|5|We have used this bassinet for travel and at home. It easily fits into a large suitcase which is nice for air travel. I don't like using hotel rental cribs. When baby was quite young I laid this in the bed next to me for sleep so she would be safe and accessible for middle of the night feedings. Overall, we have used this much more that we thought we would and it has been great. Our daughter is almost 6 months old now and we are just getting to the point where she will be too big to use it much longer.
B00BEVF1XU|5|Now we can ride in style when daddy is driving his Rally Red Lancer!!🚘
B0083QCAXS|4|We gave this book to our daughter who just had a baby girl and she loved it! It is nice because it covers 5 yrs and has the extra storage box for larger keepsake items.
B003KYSSNE|5|I am very happy with this product.  we previously had a &#34;Bummis fabulous wet bag&#34; with a zip top, and it was hard to get the dirty diapers into it without getting my hands dirty.  we bough this Thirsties bag because it has a bigger, draw-string opening, and because it is the right size to cary in the diaper bag and transport dirty cloth diapers when we are away from home.  We've had it for almost a week now, and so far and am very happy with it! it is, in fact, easier to get the dirty diapers into it with the big opening.  i do not know why so may reviewers have complained that this bag was not what they expected- the size is clearly marked in the product description.<br /><br />i will say that my baby is only 11 days old and is breast-fed, so she does not make stinky poops yet. i cannot comment on how well the bag holds in stink or very soiled diapers.  but i can say that it is the right size for what i want, and the big opening makes it easy to quickly dispose of dirty cloth diapers.  the only criticism i would offer is that i wish this bag came in other colors! white is scary because it seems it could easily become stained. but so far, it has not.
B009EDSWJA|5|Seems to be good quality although was a gift so can't comment any further
B000WUB9Y4|4|I bought this for my toy chest for for grandchildren. I was looking for the original chime ball to create a collection of toys my grandchildren's parents played with.  I was unhappy with the condition of the old ones,and settled for this one.  I love the rainforest these,and am happy with the toy, as is the baby.  The only drawback is that the original ball with the rocking horses was much more interesting because it would roll all the way over.  The leaves on this ball prevent it from getting away.  The sound is awesome.
B00MTWHDZM|5|Dominic looked absolutely fantastic in his outfit and everyone commented on it and asked where I got it.  Even the priest was impressed and admired the outfit - so befitting the special day.  Dominic was very comfortable in it and we all especially loved the wonderful added touch of the hat.
B00150T8KC|5|I love it!  The colors are well represented in the picture, but the quality and detail is even better.  Very easy to match all the colors in the quilt/sheets.
B0078LZHRK|4|It's a good product and my daughter loves it. Good price, good looking and delivery is very fast. I would like to recommend it to others.
B00IVNEFAY|3|Baby is distracted by it however not entertained for long periods of time
B000058DQJ|1|I bought the Avent Breastshells because of my sore nipples, and a way to collect leaking milk while I was not nursing, and relieve some engorment. <br /> <br />1. It is very messy when removing the colleting cap <br />2. My nipples are still sore <br />3. And the only way to relieve engorment pain is to nurse or to pump <br /> <br />If I would have known about these factors I would not have purchased this product!
B003553WHA|5|Easy to assemble. Pretty sturdy& it's the perfect length, even for my tall child.
B005WH3RBU|5|We've been using this car seat for six months now, and I couldn't be happier!  My son is 19 months - we still have him rear-facing for safety, and the seat keeps him perfectly comfortable.  My favorite thing about it is how easy it is to get him in and out of.  The tightening strap pulls very smoothly, and without much effort unlike his old one (Baby Trend).  Update: 6/23/16 - Just bought a second one of these for my daughter.  My son (now almost 4 years old) still has his and we have zero problems with it.  Nothing has broken or gotten worn down, which I'm happy about because I want to keep him in a 5 point harness as long as I can for safety.  The picture is both car seats installed in my 2012 Honda CRV.  I have the rear-facing one behind my seat.. I'm 5'4&#34; and have more than enough room in the driver's seat without having the back touching the car seat.
B005MQR9TM|5|I am not a fan of big bulky car seats and I researched high and low before we bought this for our 13 month baby boy. The Diono Radian RXT is stylish, sturdy, compact (it fits in its own seat and does not take up 1 1/2 seats)!!!! We have two older boys that fit perfectly.  Our son is completely secure and the straps have long cushion pads along with the side pads that snuggles his torso and legs. We have been using this car seat four months and I have yet to find something that I am displeased with.<br /><br />We are beyond pleased!! We just ordered an additional seat for our SUV!
B005DOS2EE|5|We LOVE these gates and fencing. We purchased 4, along with some of the fencing. We are a rescue family and have several small/medium terriers that, in spite of our best efforts, have challenged us with containment in certain areas of the house. These gates have given us control back of our household! Quality, Quality, Quality - and they look so elegant compared to other gates we've tried, and were very easy to install. I DO agree with the reviewer that mentioned the bottom brackets don't seem to take into account floor baseboards, but for the rest of what we have gotten out of it, we were happy to cut out a piece of our molding,  We will never order from anyone else again!!
B008TWGMBW|5|With so many spout covers to choose one I was happy when I came across this one made by Puj. It is soft and easily fit on the bathtub spout. My daughter loves to point out her green elephant during each bath time. With a great design and price I am sure this product will not disappoint.
B001CZ8O64|3|I bought this because it looked cute and thought my son would enjoy it. it's a pretty toy, but I don't love it... it is difficult to make it produce sounds, and it sheds orange hairs....
B0088UXLSW|5|This cot has gotten so much use already. So awesome! A bit large to travel with - had to use XL suitcase to put it in. But, love it!
B001BPZHQ0|2|It doesn't fit all faucets, not my daughter-in-law's nor mine
B003KYSSNE|3|I should have read the description better because when I looked at the picture, I thought the bag was larger than it is. It still can hold several diapers but it's more of a travel wet bag and not really one that you'd keep next to the changing table. The only problem is that because of the way it is sewn at the bottom, you can't fold it as compact as I would like so it ends up like folding a fitted sheet, just wadding it up and stuffing it somewhere in hopes that I'll use it before anyone examines my folding abilities! While I don't love it, I don't hate it either.
B000262HNU|4|I've accumulated quite a few bottle bags, from buying a breast pump and two diaper bags. This one beats them all. The height and width works great for my Dr. Brown's tall bottles. Best of all, the liner is easy to clean and won't leak. When I'm in a rush I sometimes just dump some ice cubes into my bottle coolers instead of a cool pack and every one except this one leaks.
B002KE1CBA|4|My little one like it. I took one star off because after wash it, the hanging apple lost its sound.<br />other than that it is good.
B00D04R2JA|5|Love this carseat. It has great safety ratings and is made by a great company. Britax is a little bit pricey but worth every penny. SO easy to install with the LATCH system or the seatbelt.  Very comfortable for my child who uses it. Very easy to buckle children in. Also, love that you do not have to re-thread the harness straps when you want to adjust the height. It has a lever you push on and can just adjust the height of the straps. Cupholders are great for cups, bottles, or small toys. Overall, I am so pleased with the purchase that we bought another for a different car. Love that this can grow with our child.
B0037NXP18|5|Washes easily, holds the moisture in and fits easily on a regular kitchen trash can. Much prefer it to other liners I have tried,
B00BEIOASU|5|Great Stroller for Yankee fans.  Haven't seen anyone with it and I know fans love it.  Yankee fans or not I'm sure people wish they had a stroller to show their team pride.
B007VBYVVA|4|These worked very well and are super absorbent. They turn gray after using them for awhile so I only used them at home, but they worked the best of all my burpclothes.
B000K50780|5|I love my warmer for cloth wipes. I just pour about 2 cups of wipe solution in then place this pad before adding my dry wipes.
B006P05SHO|1|Do not buy!<br /><br />We bought this to help clean up our tub area.  The suction cup kept failing when my wife and I would shower -- but while we were giving our infant son a bath, the suction cup gave way and the whole thing fell on our son.<br /><br />Luckily, we did not have anything heavy in it (a couple of rubber duckies), but still -- it gave my son a scratch and gave us a big scare.  It was terrible to hear my son scream like that, and I thank God there was nothing heavier in the bag that could have done more damage.<br /><br />It's a cheap piece of Chinese made junk, and I would not recommend that any parent waste their money or risk their children's safety with it.
B00494DNZC|5|I am a mother of four. When my oldest (15) was born, I used Playtex Vent Air and loved them. I used them for my 13 year old as well. When my 4 year old was born I bought them again and they leaked like crazy. So I tried Dr. Brown's, Avent, Mam, and others only to find leaks or so many parts that putting a bottle together was like solving a rubix cube. I ended up with the $1 Graco bottles for him. When I found I was pregnant with my youngest daughter I did some research. I decided on these because of reviews here and else ware that said they didn't leak and only 4 parts. (bottle, nipple, nipple ring, and the leak proof ring) My daughter is a week old today and I love these bottles. They do not leak at all. The nipple is a nice size. And that extra ring simply sits in the bottle before the nipple gets put on. Very simple and I can even put them together at 3 am if I forget the night before. I have had no leaking problems and very easy to wash. Thank you Avent for making a leak proof, colic friendly bottle without 100 parts!
B007D1SHUY|5|This is the best thing for the lawn drying wrack!! So versitile and makes so much more rm, especially for someone who washes a breast pump, multiple bottles and toys EVERYDAY!!
B006R3KBYO|4|Pump and accessories work well. But there is not one page of instruction, a simple booklet, diagram, nothing that shows how to moun the hands free system.
B001WAJVZM|3|Very cute abs cheesy concept, but does not fit all tub spouts. The instructions say that if the spout is hanging out of the cover at all not to use it. Unfortunately, I decided to return, because we had that issue.<br />Had it been 1/4-1/2 inch longer in front, it would have been a keeper.
B003XMWFBE|3|I wasn't too impressed with this. I had problems with things falling out of it. Can't really get a lot in it.
B00005BLM6|5|I am a first time mom and these are truly the best bottles ever made.  We tried the Playtex disposable bottles and that lasted one day.  We also have Evenflo and Ventaire bottles.  They are fine backups, but the best bottle is definitely the Dr. Brown's bottles.  They are easy to clean.  The starter pack includes a small brush to help clean the insert.  Also, our baby doesn't need much burping when we use these bottles because they cut down on the amount of air she takes in.  We will not buy any other bottle.
B00ISS2JV4|5|This car seats are amazing for the price,  got one first to tryout for my son,  and I order a second one soon after for my daughter. They love the cup holders :) .  I recommend this.
B007A2ZSZ8|5|Great addition to my steps taken to make my home a baby-safe place.
B00EVWX8IY|5|The scent is mildly sweet after dried, I wouldn't pin point cotton candy per say. Still I love it and it doesn't bother my baby. Will order again.
B0025Y6742|4|It keeps my kids' soup warm for about 4-5 hours, although I always put hot tap water in it before the soup to help it out.  It doesn't leak and my kids (ages 4 and 6) can still open it on their own.  The only thing I would change would be how much it holds.  It fits about 3/4 of a regular can of soup, and since I have one for each of them, they just each get half with empty space.  This will probably not work when they get older and need more food to keep them going, but for now it is working great.
B00J9NVZZI|3|These are an ok substitute. They are a harder material then the ameda brand ones. So far they are working great and creating enough suction. Just since the material is harder I was worried. I'm curious to see how long they last.
B0032Z81M4|5|I started out just using a Boppy for breastfeeding my twin girls, and found that once they were each around 8 pounds it was just too difficult. I purchased My Brest Friend Twin Pillow at that time, and it has made tandem feedings so much easier. This pillow is huge (not like my Boppy that I could just through in the car and take with me) but so worth the ease. There is plenty of room for one baby to rest on the pillow and up against you while you pick the other baby up. The cover washes up nicely, and the pillow is formed just right to ensure both babies are comfortable and in a good position, even when they get super relaxed (my two like to flop on their backs and sprawl when feeding...they get super comfortable). My only complaint is that the attached pillow support that velcros on is too small. It is a great idea, but I find that I have to put another pillow below it since I would like the support all the way down my back (not just where the small pillow lands).<br /><br />If you have twins and are breastfeeding, this is a must. A twin breastfeeding pillow really makes feedings so much easier.
B004044LD4|5|Great product and great price
B0047OT0DI|5|Love these blankets for our twin boys Noah's ark themed room =)  We purchased them in August and after frequent washes they are still holding up and looking great.  They are so very soft and cozy for sure!
B000G80R22|5|Well made. My daughter loves paging through these (we have bought more since the first one). I love how you can change the picture and words on the side
B0016KV73W|5|I absolutely love this porta-potty! I keep it in my bag for our outings, and can't even begin to tell you how many times it's come in handy...I have even pulled over and let my son use it in the back seat of the car. The only negative thing I can say about it is that I wish it had a higher lip on the front for boys...there have been a few occassions where some \\"peepee\\" has ended up on the floor. Also, the liners are great...some people use regular plastic bags with paper towels thrown in the bottom, but I like the liners...it's just easier and they have a nice baby powder smell.
B000UWTXNS|5|My grandson (5 months) wasn't sure what to think of this at first. The different texture I suppose. But it is one of his favorite 'toys' now! He LOVES IT!
B00GRS9XEI|5|We have two grand babies under 1 year old.  They both love this bouncer.
B00794BOIW|5|Hopefully, these will help  the baby sleep good through the night but she hasnt arrived yet so we will have to wait and see.
B0084ZCPJM|5|This carseat bundle is great and really keeps baby warm!  It's super easy to wash and almost like a blanket (which helps cut down on the bulk in the carseat.  My child doesn't need to wear a full snowsuit with this because it's super heat efficient.  The product was exactly what we wanted, the description was perfect and we received it very quickly!
B0020ML7QW|4|We bought two of these for our son and daughter's room.  The kids really like them and they have held up well through numerous washings.
B000GF5G0S|2|Not worth it for the price the zipper broke on my first trip and I didn't even put anything in there but the stroller its not even a hard material is just like a very big duffle
B000IDSLOG|4|My daughter just loves to look at Sophie and suck on her ear. Not surprised babies love this toy.
B004LEAYI4|4|I like the ease of use of this sling. The only negative I have to report is thatthere are no instructions whatsoever of how to safely get your baby out of it.
B004MDL5UA|1|If you have a chubby or TALL baby they will be squished or their feet will be smashed against the back of your car by the time they are six months.
B000W9B8XW|4|I don't think this seat is as good as the reviews I've read.  It's fine, just not spectacularly comfortable, etc.  My daughter is 4 1/2 years old, 40 inches tall and just at the 33 pound requirement for this seat.  (most are 40 min. required) We needed a new booster as she has grown too tall for the old carseat.  This one has probably a little more padding than a Graco cheaper one, but not as much as I would have liked.  Also, I wished I had bought a full size seat as my daughter ends up all hunched over when sleeping on a long car trip.  But my daughter claims to love it (probably because she can unbuckle -not buckle- her own seat now and says she's a big girl!
B0019UJLMS|5|Goes with the others I have up
B0012E4FV8|4|I was very worried about traveling with my two year old on the airplane because he really does not like to sit still.  I thought about taking a carseat on the plan but really did not want to have to lug it around in the airport. I was skeptical of this harness but thought it would be better than nothing.  When I got on the first plane I was able to set this up in about two minutes for the first time and immediately strapped my two year old in and told him just like in a car he has to sit still.  This worked very well. I think just having the extra restraints convinced him he had to sit still. On the next flight when he wanted to sleep I unhooked the top part of the harness so he could lean on me. Otherwise he would not have been able to sleep with this harness.  On the last flight he did realize that he could unhook the airplane seat belt so we had to fight about that a little bit.  The one thing I wish this had was a strap between the legs so he could not slide down but this was not a huge issue.<br /><br />As far as the other reviews that this could choke a child if they slid down too far... that just seems silly to me.  First of all I didnt really have that issue. Second of all, if you have a small child that would be able to choke on this, don't you think they will have a parent next to them that would notice if they were choking on it... Like I said, those comments seem silly.
B000O7YOWY|5|SO VERY SOFT!!  Like your favorite tshirt
B00EEJOV3A|3|I started using these Zoli BOT cups at 6 months and they were a great way for my babies to learn to use a straw. However, these expensive straw replacements keep tearing after a couple of uses. I think maybe that's because my babies have teeth now. I also find them hard to clean. I don't regret starting off with the Zoli BOTs before my babies could use a different type of cup, but given how expensive the replacement straws are and that they keep getting ruined, I won't be continuing to use them.
B004GCJMLG|5|My husband will be the first person to say that carpentry is NOT his thing. We were almost going to hire a handyman to install these but when he read the directions and decided to tackle the project himself I kept hearing him say, &#34;Genius&#34; over and over again in regards to the installation process as he installed them. He buzzed through all our cabinets and draws installing these with easy. He did by himself a new &#34;toy&#34; from Lowes to help with the job though. It was called Hammer Head ($40) that was a brand new product in the store and it was low profile drill unlike a conventional drill so it allowed him to install the locks easily in tight spots like inside the drawers. Nice locks and Amazon has by far the best price for the 8 pack.
B00BPACWCI|5|Excellent!!! The fabric feels so nice
B001QCIG16|3|I bought this for my granddaughters ages 2 and 5. The fountain lasted for one play time in the tub. Very disappointed! Water got in where the batteries were and ruined it . I just think that maybe it was a poorly  designed.
B000GKWA66|4|This sheep has a 20 or 40 minute timer. My son naps for two hours. It is great for the 40 minutes but since I have other kids, people over, deliveries or whatever noises outside the 40 minutes my son wakes up. Still great quality!
B0018ZC7H0|5|Great price, very easy to set up and use. Love that it folds flat and will slide under seats in car. The side pockets hold TP and bags so there is nothing else needed. Handle makes it very easy to carry. Very light weight but VERY sturdy! Highly recommended for car, camping and boating.
B002T44LFK|5|This is the only animal backpack that is actually big enough to carry anything in.  We recently got this for a trip we were taking.  I knew it would be a hit because my daughter could wear it and hold on to the dog.  I was worried that if the animal was on her back that she would throw a fit and insist on holding it.  We used this as our diaper bag.  It fit 5-6 diapers, some wipes in a baggy as well as a shirt, pants and socks for my daughter.  It doesn't have the best straps and clip compared to others I've seen but my daughter doesn't really wander so that wasn't a big deal for us.
B00516GACU|3|Its a nice book but for as many pages as it has, it sure doesn't have enough firsts.  Wish it had more space for the first year.
B003FGWA8G|5|This is a wonderful monitor.  I love the different settings for sound and love love love that it shows me the temperature!!
B0043D28B4|5|We got this for our 5 week old baby and she loves it! She will actually pay attention to it as I read, which is really cool considering how young she is. It's short but engaging enough even for a newborn. The crinkly pages keep their attention and the contrasting colors will also grab their attention.
B00005QI1H|3|I found this swing for my nephew by chance. After returning back our previous one (&quot;Cubby Parade&quot;-- see the review there) we decided to get our first one again since it had many good features that many others didn't have (&quot;Smart response&quot;-- see the review). While we were going out of the store I noticed something very colorfull in the area all the returned items were. It was this swing... we instantly liked it and tried the baby on it. It seemed to have everything we were looking for in a swing (big, comfortable seat, music and some kind of stimulation for the baby and in this case that would be the colors and sounds) It's even portable and after getting it home we realized that was very usefull.<BR>But after almost a month we noticed that it would swing very slowly like the others and my nephew would outgrow it very soon. It was obvious it had to be either another swing or none.<br />We returned it to the store and decided he didn't need a swing. Instead, I bought him my personal favourite: a doorway jumper (&quot;Party Time&quot;-- I think I already made a review there) and we couldn't be more satisfied with a purchase.
B000WJHF7A|5|love Them! They Were Perfect For What I Needed Them For!The Quality Of Then Were Great Too! great Pricing Too!
B000G7TIZA|5|I recommend this changing pad, it is an awesome product, best one I have seen around. Also my son seems to like napping in it!
B00KRJQIKK|5|Perfect size and easy to wash!
B001UF8BL4|4|My daughter is 5 months old and I bought this for her about 2 months ago. She loved it from the moment she had it in her hands; it's absolutely her favorite toy. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the description states that it's soft flexible plastic; but I can't say I agree. I guess it's as soft as plastic ball can be but it takes quite a bit of strength to \\"bend\\" and flex. My daughter has banged it on her head/face a few times and no bruises or marks were left so I don't feel that it is dangerously hard.<br /><br />Overall a wonderful toy that fascinates my daughter.
B003PCYMP4|2|UPDATE:  My 18-month old baby got teeth in the last few months (she got teeth very late)and chewed through the binky.  In a dramatic moment, I had to cut off the binky and give her back the amputated lamb. She tried to suck its face.<br /><br />It would be great if there were some way to remove the binky and put a new one on there.  Otherwise plan on spending $15 every month.<br /><br />We now use a $1 mouse from Ikea.  We fasten the binky into the mouse tail.  My daughter loves her mice.  Each night before bed she asks for \\"my mouse\\" (we only give them to her at bedtime).<br /><br />Previous Review:<br /><br />We just bought this for our 16 month old daughter a couple of months ago and it was the best $13 we ever spent on any baby product.<br /><br />Our second baby loved her pacifier from birth.  She only took the Soothie kind and wouldn't take other pacifiers.  The problem with the Soothie-brand pacifiers is that they bounce around and are hard to find.  So, if she was sleeping and her binky rolled out of the crib, we would have to feel around on the floor to find it.  We learned that we had to be armed each night with half a dozen Soothies.<br /><br />The other [bigger] problem we had with her since around 4 months was that she was waking constantly at night looking for her pacifier (this was on top of her other sleep problems related to her having severe colic which are off-topic here).  It got to the point that my husband and I were waking every 20-30 minutes at night.  At 6 months I was losing my mind with sleep deprivation so we took away her binky cold turkey.  This worked for a while but she gradually started waking more and more until we were back to waking many times a night.  Then we would give in and let her have the pacifier again and she would sleep better for awhile.  Soon, she would again start waking and the process would repeat itself until we again would take away the pacifier.  We went through this process several times.  It started to feel more and more cruel to deprive her of this comfort.  She would scour the drawers in the kitchen searching for binkys that we may have forgotten about.  Desperate, she would pull out a bottle nipple and suck on that.  It was a sad sight.<br /><br />Enter this little lamb.  It is amazing.  She find it at night easily. It soothes her. She loves it. She is sleeping through the night pretty consistently for the first time ever in her life. Occasionally, it will fall out of the crib or she will be too lazy to search around for it if it is not in arm's reach but it has made a world of difference.  If only we had known about these sooner so much pain and suffering (on both sides) could have been averted.<br /><br />It is supposed to be for babies under 6 months but I think it is even better for older babies that can grab the pacifier by themselves.  She always liked the infant Soothies better than the harder ones intended for older babies so this works out perfectly for us.  The only problem is that we are not sure how to clean it and ours is looking a little over-loved...e and more cruel to deprive her of this comfort.

B00A46A582|5|It was what my son picked out for his first baby .  My first grandchild Jaxon a boy of course.  So I just had to have it. Everything!  They truly love it and it was so easy to match with the furniture and other things.  We love it!
B00073HJG8|5|Perfect space saver in my daughters room!
B004I1KVWO|5|This is simple yet the turquoise color is beautiful and really adds a ton of color.  It can be coordinated with other colors and patterns for baby girls or boys.  It is sturdy and holds a lot of diapers.
B001C0IZRW|3|The product is well constructed and durable, but it is sized small.  I ordered a size 3. My grandson is a small 3 year old who wears mostly size 2T clothing.  The snowsuit was too small for him.  Also, the leg openings are very small and will not fit over a child's boots.
B005BQRTMK|1|Waste of money. I bought 2 packs of these and the bracelets.. Basically stickers. Used sharpie, followed directions, and ink rubbed off / transferred to skin in the car on the way to the park.. But I will say the bracelets were no better..
B00AHVR3GQ|5|Excellent quality for a folding stroller.  Great and easily accessible basket in the back.  Comfortable handle.  Maneuvers well.  Smooth ride for 10 month old grandson who was visiting.
B005XTKIBO|2|The cup is very cute and has silicon sides so it's easy for a baby to grip on. Unfortunately, it leaks and I have to use a zip-lock all the time...
B006PB2FX8|5|This has worked perfectly for my toddler-aged grandbaby and I. I have had no issues taking the trays apart, they clean up easily, and if you take a second to line the arms up with the right place on the tray, there's no problem putting it back on. It's cute as heck, and the fabric wipes off easily too.
B0000W3TX8|5|Just returned from the mountains to visit Thomas the Tank Engine!  With three children--this was the easyiest way of transporting baby by far!!!! Got lots of \\"wish we were smart enough to have purchased that\\" looks from other parents, who were leaving their strollers outside rides as we walked on in.  With this being our third child-we've done it all with baby products.  My husband didn't even want to trade out while our daughter was riding.  He enjoyed the bonding. Wasn't hot and was very comfortable!!!  You won't be disappointed with your purchase.
B00OMP4WFS|5|I really LOVE Charlie Banana swim underwear/panties. I began to look for a reusable swim diaper cause lets face it, swim diapers are a waste of money. So I found these and with the good reviews I decided to trust them and order a pair. They fit my daughter perfectly. I ordered her a medium and she's 3. My daughter is and always has been so skinny that I have to sew up the waists on all of her clothes.  Which is the reason I was shocked to see a DRAWSTRING on the inside of these! ingenious! They are beautiful so I put them on on the outside of her diaper when she's wearing skirts so her diaper isn't hanging out. When we get seriously into potty training I'll love to use these as well because some of them cane with a super thick bottom (the crotch) so it will soak up the pee for an accident. The only thing I don't like is that some of them I ordered had the thick crotch, but some didn't have the extra padding... Don't know what's that about
B009AE77EO|5|not as beloved as the banana teether but still a favorite at our house.
B004044LD4|5|It fits the bed well and is apparently comfortable as suggested by the ease with which my great granddaughter falls asleep and stays asleep.
B00NLJAU8E|3|Good car seat
B000VBGT3K|3|My baby used paci and was a fussy medicine taker, so I tried this. Worked ok for larger volumes of liquid, when I diluted the actual dose with a little apple juice. I had a little bit of a hard time screwing the paci on when filled with liquid and it leaked often.
B00JPXPRNI|5|I love, love, love this! The instruction video was easy to follow, and it looks awesome. Be sure to email the company right away with your color choice and name spelling. This will be my go to for wedding shower gifts.
B000KUAS20|5|Great!  We use it about 20 times per day for our twins and we have no complaints!  The covers fit well enough.
B002XMWILC|5|I love this night light's portability and the light is the perfect brightness/dimness for night feedings. I also love that it is rechargeable and I never have to worry about replacing the batteries. Out of the four colors it shines I prefer the blue light. I take it with me from the nursery, to the bed, where I feed my babies, and back to the nursery to put the babies down, and all without introducing too much light. I also mix formula by it. One improvement I could suggest is a switch to increase brightness which I find I sometimes need when I'm trying to read the sides of the bottles. Other than that, this light is perfect and I'm considering buying another one.
B00IH8KRRI|3|Item is definitely for a newborn.  Cute prop, but had to work to make usable due to shipping flattening them out.
B0034G5V06|5|I liked the photo album very much.  It was exactely like the review written about it and just what we wanted.
B002K99IUM|5|This spoon is absolutley wonderful.  If you are traveling in a car, train, plane, this is a must have.  You just put the baby food in the bottom portion and squeeze it out.  No need for balancing baby food containers and spoons, etc.  Every new mom should register for this!  I get compliments on mine all of the time.     In response to one of the reviews that was posted about not being able to squeeze the food through- that has never happened to me.  The only thing I thought was slightly hard to squeeze through was thick yogurt, but even that wasn't a problem.  Use it for baby food and for babies ranging from 6-12 mos.    Pros: great for travel, easy to use, and chic   Con:  Can't hold as much food as I would like (holds about 1 large container of baby food)
B0077P3U8A|5|Received this from our registry and was a little nervous, having not seen it in person and only having read a handful of reviews.  It came fully assembled, which made things so much easier, and is a great compact size for a corner of the nursery.  Baby should be here in a few weeks and i'm already thinking it will be a great place for breastfeeding, but also for sitting together and reading as she gets older. This will also blend in perfectly with our living room furniture once its job is done in the nursery. That was very important to me, but I also didn't want anyone looking at our registry feeling compelled to purchase a thousand dollar chair, as most of the upholstered models are!<br /><br />It is true that you cannot lay your head back in this glider because of the height of the back of the chair.  I knew this before receiving from the reviews, but I suppose if I had not that might have been disappointing if I was hoping to sleep in it.<br /><br />After receiving I decided i'd love to have a gliding ottoman to go with it so I could really kick back. I considered the Babyletto Kyoto Ottoman in Mocha so it would match. Luckily, I checked the dimensions as I think the Kyoto Ottoman would be much too high compared to the seat of the Madison.  I ended up purchasing the Dutailier Regular Harvest Finish Gliding Matching Ottoman, which is a great match and almost half the price! And, as an added bonus, if I put a small pillow behind my back and lay back in the Madison with my feet on the Ottoman, I CAN lay my head on the back of the seat and think I can even fall asleep in it.<br /><br />Highly recommended and very comfy :)
B002CN5E22|1|Didn't work too long.
B006Z6E8AG|5|The popular bowl ,very cute.And my baby loves it.Many babies in China used this kind of bowl.Wish there's more discount.
B007XL658K|5|I used this all the time! My baby slept so much better when she was swaddled. After I had success with these, I bought two more.  :)
B007NG5UEU|4|This has been great so far. We've had only for a few weeks so I may change my mind after a few months depending on how long it lasts. Very very quiet no static whatsoever- I had an old one that had so much static I thought something was wrong with it bc hear no interference or static at all. It beeps even when I turn it off in and plugged in the parent set in liv rm but haven't read directions why so I just unplug it when I go to bed and turn the other one on in bedroom. I've used the microphone part which is a great feature to have that others don't!
B0085F7T4W|5|Amazing footmuff! Very long - 114cm. Can be used as a seat liner or stroller footmuff. Thank you!
B000NOXLFY|3|I'm not sure if this had an effect or not. It did not, however, bring about any harm so I guess it's ok.
B00020L78M|5|This is a great product! Keeps my 9 month old twin girls safe while I cook and clean. It easily breaks apart for storage.
B002J4U8P2|5|My 4 month old grandson loves this.  It's easy for him to spin and grab.
B002GWVZDQ|5|this bed is worth the money it is very sturdy and build great. i would recommend there products to everyone. but if you order it order it with the mattress.
B000YZAF60|5|I love this high chair! Before my toddler was old enough to sit in the high chair, I used the seat that is incorporated into this chair.  I could easily cook and clean the kitchen with her in the seat, and roll her wherever was convenient for me. It's easy to take apart and clean, and the baby seat was perfect for the first feedings when babies can not quite sit in a high chair.
B000S35QLC|1|I have purchased numerous items from Amazon.com-- even those that didn't live up to the billing-- and have never once left a review until now.  This monitor is the bane of my existence.  I bought it replace the one that quit working after our first child since it seems to be the only simple one out there.  What a mistake!   Now I'm cursed with this bleepin'beepin' thing for the next 2+ years unless I decide that my sanity is more valuable and junk it.  It's awful. The range indicator beeps all of the time!!! Aghhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!1
B00031XUG2|5|This is so much fun to roll across the floor! The little heads pop in and out as it rolls. My one year old had a grand time trying to figure this ball out using his little finger to push the heads in and turning it at the same time.
B00000ISE2|5|I have an 18 month old who recieved this toy and a 3 year old. Both ME and my kids love it! (Kids of all different ages who come to play at my house are fascinated with it also.) I was surprised at how quickly my 18 month old grasped how to operate this toy. It has reinforced colors, shapes, and sequencing for her just for starters. It has also held her attention better than most toys and is one she plays with often.
B000HEE73K|5|I saw these and thought this would work for my<br />Granddaughter's car seat, see loves them and<br />likes chewing on the ears.
B004FOPBGU|5|Was such a pain to have to constantly hold my 20 month old son's snack cups while he feeds himself, cause he would ALWAYS flip them over or drop them! Especially a pain when we're out and he's in his stroller and I have to stop each time so he can munch on some cheerios/whatever.<br /><br />With the munchie mug, wherever my son goes, he carries it and feeds himself!!! Walking around the house, in the stroller, in the car! I never have to worry if he flips it or drops it (he still does!). I would say some cheerios still manage to fall out when he's pulling his hand out, but it's still a fraction of what would go to waste if not for this mug. Not a big deal, I just pick up the 10 or 20 cheerios in the car or on the floor and throw them out. Beats picking up the HUNDREDS that would fall out of his regular snack cup.
B00H8MSK1Y|5|We really like this car seat. Our child is comfortable and the upgrades they made from the previous &#34;70&#34; edition are considerably better(which we own). Wish this came out before we bought our other car seat, we would of bought 2! Shipping was quick and packaging was the original packaging(no damage at all)
B009EVOVRO|4|I bought this for a friend after reading the positive reviews. One of the most commented things (besides the chic-ness of the bag) was the clips to hold on to the stroller. I met with her when her baby was five weeks old and one of the clips has already broken off. Disappointed by that. I have not contacted the seller yet to see if they will fix. I will update with feedback after I do so. The rest of the bag is as described and nice!
B00AY5PL96|5|Good product
B009JV34RC|5|Great product. Great company.
B0031ARQLC|5|This is a sturdy toddler bed. It's a nice dark color and appears to be made of decent quality material. Fits a crib mattress just fine and is a very lightweight frame.
B00LFNONX6|5|Purchased this item for a Subaru Forrester in southeastern U.S.  The suction cups have stayed on despite a scorching week in the 90's, but I also used the adherent cling feature.  Think of removable window clings but better.  No marks or real adhesive, but they stick very well to the window.  They provide similar protection to a darker tint on the window, but don't completely block the sun.  They aren't big enough to fill out the whole window (as expected based on dimensions), but still provide adequate coverage if placed strategically. Also fit well in a compact care our nanny drives. The little carrying case is nice if you want to port them, but we plan to just leave them up. I was hesitant to order anything because all the other products I've tried, from cut to size window tint clings to retractable shades to products similar to this just haven't been worth the money.  However, today I am ordering 2 more sets of these for the rest of the backseat windows in all vehicles.
B007S1T42O|5|If you have a little one, this is the perfect thing to have for bath time.  Give the support you need with the added cushion.  It holds infants just right and makes bath time so much easier for the parents.
B00AHVR4LA|4|I use it as a baby changing area now, but will use it as a bed when we are traveling.  Wish the bottom was a little softer, but I can cushion it with a blanket.  Folds up to a good size for travel.
B002Y5XIO4|5|initially when I gave them to my twin boys they didn't care too much for them, but after giving it another shot a few months later, they LOVE them.  They both sit next to each other with their cups and feed each other from them.  It's great on the go or at home.  They can definitely dump everything out if they want to, but as long as I give it to them when it's snack time, there's usually not much of a mess to clean up after.  Plus, if they're whiny, giving them a snack in it usually does the trick.
B002IAEA06|3|The door knob covers work well but are hard on my arthritic hands--you have to press them hard to open the door. But they last and are totally child-proof. The drawer latches worked well for awhile but then the plastic bent. I had to take them out and put in latches with a spring [[ASIN:B000YIX27Q KidCo Spring Action Cabinet Lock 4-pack]] which have been great and are still working after a year or more. The U shaped cabinet latches are still working after a year or two. The only problem was with some cabinets where the two knobs were too far apart to be able to hook the latch over them both in order to lock them. Outlet covers are a must and work well. It's challenging to child-proof a house.
B001OC5UNK|2|I actually wanted to use this gate outside to keep my dog within the porch.  But it turned out to be designed to be permanently installed on a wall.  Also, the metal was kind of rickety and kept coming apart even when I applied pressure with the feet. Additionally, the latch did not close completely, I guess it was broken. I suppose that's what you get for $30.  It might be ok if you install it permanently but I would probably spend a little more to get something higher quality.
B003ILKLKC|5|It allowed you to make mistakes, you could detach what you pasted already without damaging the picture- which we found extremely helpful. I would recommend it to anyone! :)
B002SW3B40|5|We love these blankets! They are light enough for summer but cuddly enough for fall/winter! They seriously get softer with every wash.  My 2 yr old loves it and my 3 mo old cuddles so close with it...These are a must for any baby/toddler...They are also great if you need to cover up for nursing or cover the carseat from sun! Very great for swaddling..I tell everyone that has a baby or is pregnant about these...even great for a shower present! :) Thank you Aden and Anais for making such a quality product!
B000058DP2|1|This stroller has been nothing but headaches. I would not reccomend this product at all. It is nice to look at, but not nice to own. I beg you, choose another stroller to purchase, I wish someone would have told me befor I spent 140.00 on the darn thing!
B0038JE5N8|4|Remember to disassemble the plate and its rim when washing; if not, food particles and odor will be retained. Otherwise, good. Because it's not ceramic, the white part of the bowl and plate will show signs of wear/tear after awhile and may stain.
B002UKXLJK|4|My children range from age 23 to 37. I had this type of cup with each one. They may<br />be hard to camoflage than the soft cups, but believe me when I say the relief they<br />provide outweighs that problem. My two daughters are having babies, and I was<br />so afraid I would be unable to find them, because I can't find them in stores. They<br />give relief, but mostly they save on embarrasment while out in public. The cloth and<br />disposable pads always failed me and let circles form on my clothes, but these I<br />could go to the nearest restroom and dispose of the excess milk until I was able to<br />nurse. I also kept them clean and would save the excess when at home. I am getting<br />sets for both girls!
B0012HCECC|4|The rails came with the wrong screws to put it together, also when I opened the package there was a piece of the rail that was broken.  You can can get the screws from the other parts of the crib your not using anymore. The rails are holding up pretty nicely, there have been up to three kids jumping on the bed, the full size bed is sturdy and will last a while.
B006CWTL9G|4|I appreciate that this doll is machine washable--since so many kids toys don't seem to be!  This is a small doll--perfect for little hands to hold onto. I give it to my daughter to distract her during diaper changes.
B00BRHSD5Y|5|This is a must! We've raised many children and trying to take temperatures on infants can be a chore. This thing is very accurate, construction is great and it comes with a cover for the nipple. So far, it's been very quick and reliable. Plus, the price is pennies!
B00FXA9WI8|5|I liked this but be advised it does take some time to put it up right as everything is in little pieces. The vines are broken up into sections. The monkeys are broken up in to head, body, separate arms and legs. The tree branch is in pieces. Im sure if they were all one piece it would be difficult to not have it  fold over on itself. So there is a method to the madness but it was a bit time consuming to put up. I will add a picture later when I have time. Great product tho.
B0036OROGU|1|My first review- Great product. Easy to use. Lightweight. Delivery was fast.    Second review after use- After a month of using I discovered that the quality was poor and the seams came apart in multiple places. This carrier looks exactly like a free hand mai tei but it's no where near the quality.
B003HUAHXU|5|I love the ocean wonders bag but it wasnt the bag in the picture. if you want the one in the picture get the precious planet bag that i actually was hoping for but as i said i am happy with the one i recieved,.  (Update) As i said before i love this bag it is so adorable. I am very happy with it. After i left that comment the picture has been changed and is now the right bag. I would definitly recomened this to people.I would also reccomend the seller too as he sent me some baby stuff to make up for it as well as a personal letter. I would definitly buy from them again not just because of the additional items but because i like how they makes sure your happy the best they can. Thank you so much!
B00E5LYF8S|1|Had to return it. Material was not what I expected at all!!
B004Y42BL4|5|love love love this little bag. I use it all the time when im our running around being a single mother it helps a lot
B003457E16|3|this keeps my son from playing with the spout but it is hard to get off when someone needs to shower and barely fits
B007AJ85QA|1|These are absolutely horrible. The screws strip way to easily and they are very difficult to install. If everything isn't perfect the cabinet won't close
B000GCE5C6|5|my baby loves to brush his little teeth with this gum, its taste really good and its not dangerous for him. i recomend it.
B00A47J6Y0|5|This chair is not perfect. The tray has a slope and the leg holes should be redesigned. Thus said- we used this all the time and will buy a new one asap if this one ever breaks or is left somewhere. I keep it in my vehicle at all times. So perfect for zillions of situations.
B002A9JCVW|5|I had used the cute grass rack for the past year but it took a long time for bottles and sippy cups to dry inside because of a lack of air flow at the bottom. This product doesn't have that problem and more effectively gets things to air dry. It's not hideously ugly like some other drying racks. If you are debating between the grass rack and this one get this one!
B005UV0USQ|2|The new born sleeper was very nice to use.  The changer started sagging into the bassinet by day 3. There is no support for all sides of the changer which is really bad design.  It is still useable EDIT(  IT IS NOT USEABLE)  .  If you want to use all of the parts for a trip or something, it is a disaster to pack.  You CAN'T break down and stow the changer or the newborn sleeper.  Such a pity, because the idea/concept is there.    EDIT*****    BEWARE OF POSITIONAL ASPHYXIA WITH THE BASSINET!!
B003JHUV96|5|If I had read the other reviews on Amazon only prior to purchasing these plates, well, I never would have gotten to the \\"buy\\" phase. As it turns out, we visited a family friend with a 2 year old and my son got to use her plates (he is 20 months) - these sassy plates. My picky eater is still a picky eater, but he is ever so happy to dip and each of these plates have a dip section for ketchup, etc. They also have sections that separate the food nicely and he doesn't like his food mixed up. And he can carry the plate - it's not too big for him to carry across the room and it has a lip so the food doesn't slide off. Once I ordered the plates and saw they came with the tops, we take them every time we go out to eat. We bring his plate and a top, and use the top to contain the mess left on the plate (including his beaba plasticware which fits fine under the lid) so we can pack him up in a hurry and go home, without trying to clean up the plate prior to leaving. No more being worried one of the plates at the diner will end up broken on the floor and no more risk of dirtying the diaper bag. As for the review that said that you couldn't cut on the plates without leaving a mark, it's unclear to me what plastic plates can be cut on without leaving a mark... Regardless, we don't cut on these plates and they are in great shape, even after many washings in the dishwasher.
B0039GDDWY|5|I have purchased two of these Planet Wise Diaper bags for use at daycare.  The bags are sturdy and hold up well.  The only issue we have had with them is that the strap starts to pull away from the main body (at daycare the bag is hung by it's strap....a bag full of diapers gets heavy!) so a quick sewing fix has mended it.  For reference this bag is washed at least 2x a week and has been in constant use for about 6 months now.
B00GY8J9BS|5|We purchased this stroller about 5 months ago for our upcoming trips. After 2 weeks in Australia, 3 weeks in Europe, I love it so much that I have to write a 5 star review.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Light-weight. It's one of the most light-weight strollers you can find on market. With the strap, it's very easy to carry. When in Europe, we had to lift the stroller up the stairs from time to time (especially across the bridges in Venice). So we were very glad that the stroller itself is very light weight.<br />2. Decent recline. This stroller was mainly for our one-year-old son. The recline function is comfortable enough for him to nap a few times during the day. Amazingly, our 4-year-old daughter also enjoys napping in this stroller very much, when she is tired during the trip. She weights 40 lbs and is 43 in tall. Her head does come out a little bit higher than the back of the seat. But it does not bother her at all.<br />3. Affordable price. We have a B-ready at home that we really love. So I did not want to spend a lot on an umbrella stroller that we use for travel only. Compared to other high-end brand strollers with similar features, this stroller is very affordable.<br />4. Folding is easy and can be single-handed + foot with practice.<br />5. Good size storage. We always have our baby carrier, blanket, extra clothes, food, etc. in the storage basket. They do become hard to reach when the seat is fully reclined, but when the kid is sleeping, we don't really need to take any of these things out.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. As mentioned in other reviews, the cup holder does fall off pretty often. I have a separate stroller organizer (with 2 cup holders) attached, so I don't really use the cup holder that much.<br />2. The front wheels does get stuck from time to time. What we have learned that when that happens, just pull the stroller backward for a few steps and then again forward. It usually solves the problem.<br />3. Single hand pushing is a bit of stretch. After a lot of practice, my husband was able to push it with just one hand. But in general, it takes both hands to control it.<br /><br />All in all, this is the perfect stroller for traveling. I love it so much that even now that we are back home, I left it in my trunk and use it often for short grocery trip, etc.a lot of practice, my husband was able to push it with just one hand. But in general, it takes both hands to control it.<br /><br />All in all, this is the perfect stroller for traveling.

B001QC77W0|4|I used this specifically to visit family that didn't have any kind of high chair when my son was 9 months old.  He's  little guy and also wiggly.  It definitely depended on the chair we were using whether or not it worked well.  Any chair that had a high back and a fabric seat worked well, but on a chair without fabric then my son was sliding everywhere.  We didn't use it in a restaurant, but I wouldn't have.  It was fine for home, but I really did have to be paying attention to him the entire time because he could have easily tipped sideways.  I definitely think it's a great product and I would recommend it to other people and I think that my son is now 11 months, walking, and much more stable sitting on furniture that it would work much better.  It did what I needed it to do in a pinch and it was so easy to travel with.
B00005QI1G|5|My daughter has been using this bouncer for the last 6 months and she still enjoys it.  I purchased another brand to keep at my mother's, but it made her sit up too straight, therefore, would cause my newborn to slouch. She sits comfortably in this one.  It is also easy to take off and clean.  Anything that's easy to clean has my vote!
B000RFFQEI|5|Good buy
B0087IWPQ4|3|Doesn't work as well as I wanted it to. My 2 year old stills wiggles around too much and water gets in her face anyway. This is good for my 6 year old but not helpful for young kids who still squirm. Too bad b/c that's usually who you need this for. It does make a nice rinse cup but the front is useless for keeping water out of the eyes.
B005IWMADK|3|3 stars due to weird tails that doesn't hold tight to stroller, and the button is too hard for littles ones.
B0051Y1L1W|4|I would have given this 5 stars if the headrest were a little bit larger. My daughter is 2 months old (granted, she's 98th percentile for height but her head is only 30th percentile) and her head is snug in the headrest. I will be able to use the insert without the headrest, but it's days are already numbered and that is disappointing because she is so young it would have been nice for her to use it longer.
B00NJCACVS|1|Two of the three swaddle blankets came damaged. One has a large hole & several large snags across the whole front of the design. The other has many dark spots that at first looked like lint but upon inspection turned out to be some type of hardened glue. No way to get them off. Requesting a replacement to see if this is an anomaly....although I'm not confident as the matching burp cloths I ordered had a large hole at the edge of one where the material was never sewn between the binding. Very poor quality control for such expensive items. These will snag easily with usage but shouldn't be received, brand new, before baby is born & already be ruined.
B00BCYDSKW|5|These are super cute but run big nothing a stitch or two couldn't fix.
B005D6JDCW|5|This set is so cute. The colors are bright even after washing. I ordered the 6 month size for my 4 month old. It fits and allows for some room to grow. I would say the sizing matches up pretty well to Carters. Shipping was fast too. Couldn't be happier!
B00GEF7I5A|5|Best thing I have ever bought! A lifesaver
B0052QYLUM|5|Our family wanted a monitor that was not complicated, simple, safe, and affordable. This monitor was recommended to us by a friend and we like it a lot! Here are some reasons why:<br />1.) easy install/set-up<br />2.) can monitor up to 4 different areas (comes with one camera)<br />3.) good signal connection (for us, we've probably been at about a distance of 800 feet and seems to work fine)<br />4.) battery life is good (depends on how long it's on/off. it has auto shut-off when it doesn't sense sound and will turn on if there is sound).<br />5.) you can adjust brightness of screen<br />6.) you can allow the monitor to turn on/off based on sound detected or not-detected. helps with battery life.<br />7.) NIGHT time monitoring! you can see/monitor at night!<br />8.) easy to use!<br />9.) easy to mount!<br />10.) great customer service at infant optics!
B002VBXY4U|3|The chair itself is great, please read other 5-star reviews on that. However, I am surprised why nobody said anything about the toy bar. The bar is just wrong... and not child friendly at all!!! The toys are sewed onto it and cannot be removed unless you use a pair of scissors. In fact, the central toy (the plastic lion) is large enough so when it is turned perpendicular to a baby's face it hits the baby right into it when he/she bounces in the chair! And BTW, so do the other two toys when the baby slides to the side a little bit.
B004PHWL3I|5|As described..  Recommend.  A+++++
B003UTCKH4|5|Arrived on time and so far has worked fine.  It's still too early to see how it performs down the road.
B0083SULYQ|4|Overall it's a good change pad. The vinyl cover means it's easy to clean and I don't have to worry about laundering another sheet.<br />Like many reviewers mentioned, the toy bar is really flimsy and doesn't stand up properly after a while. That is the only down side. My 2 month old LOVES the monkey and giraffe on it though (isn't it funny how babies show their preferences?) and enjoys looking at and 'talking' to the animals. We'll probably have to use something to reinforce that bar so it stays vertical but after 2 months it totally flops over.
B002B8QL0C|2|This pad seems to be built OK and the size was exactly what I needed.  However, the picture and description when I purchased it don't show that it is quilted with rose floral pattern.  First off, roses aren't a great pattern for little boys.  Second, it's flat-out stupid to have any kind of quilting pattern on a diaper changing pad.  It's not actual stitching, just an imprinted pattern, but it makes it more difficult to clean.  Had this information been in the description and I bought it anyway, I would rate this pad highly.  But it's not.
B004FHM8KY|5|As a first time mom, I agonized over and researched strollers to death.  I was so sick of looking at them by the time I picked one.  I ended up with the Uppababy Vista, which I loved but it was just so big and heavy!  It was almost impossible to get in and out of the car with a baby on your hip.  Enter the Maclaren.  My baby was right at 3 months when we got it, we were going on a long roadtrip and my husband was refusing to bring the uppababy, due to it's huge size.  I can easily unfold or fold this with baby on my hip.  The recline is a dream, I wish our BOB, which we use for running, reclined like this.  I was so worried about lightweight strollers and chinky wheels, but these are definitely not chinky and our little guys gets a smooth ride.  My husband is 6'3\\" and he isn't hunched over pushing it!  He is very comfortable heightwise pushing it.  The basket sucks, but it's a small stroller, what do you expect.  The canopy is great!  We are very happy with this purchase, and I wish I wouldn't have blown the money on the vista.  You will definitely get your money's worth on the maclaren!<br /><br />Baby is 9 months old and this is still the only stroller for us!  It has been on a plane trip, gate checked without a bag, and it did great!  A couple of scratches, but that just builds character.  I really wish I didn't blow all of that money on the Vista.  While it's nice, it just isn't necessary and the Maclaren does everything we need!  Oh and my sister in law had another fancy umbrella stroller, an Inglesina I think.  And while hers was a little smaller and lighter, there was not doubt that my baby was more comfortable and the umbrella on the Maclaren kept our baby out of the sun, while her's just didn't do the trick.  I couldn't be happier!
B000099Z9K|3|Like many others, I am rating this seat with only 3 out of 5 stars because it is nearly impossible to install correctly in the rear facing position--even in larger vehicles.  We have a Dodge Durango SUV with decent leg room in all seating rows.  To install this car seat in the rear facing position with the correct full incline according to the level lines on the buckle guides, the front seat has to be pushed completely forward, leaving no leg room at all for front seat passengers.  I tried it with and without the base, and with a very thick rolled up towel to get the correct inline.  However, buckling the seat in tight enough so that there isn't too much side to side play throws off the inline also, forcing the seat forward into a more upright possition.  And passing the vehicle belt under the padding between the crotch portion of the five-point harness, when it is adjusted for a newborn, and the back of the seat (as instructed by the manual) bunches up the belt so badly that it looks neither comfortable nor safe for the infant.  So, if you are looking to save some money, as we were, by purchasing this as an all-in-one car seat for a newborn to toddler to booster seat, look elsewhere.  After having spent at least an hour and a half trying to install this seat correctly, I did not feel that it was a safe option for an infant in the rear facing position.  Needless to say, I went out and purchased a newborn/infant car seat/carrier, and had it installed safely and correctly in about fifteen minutes according to the manual instructions. <br /> <br />All of the above being said it works wonderfully in the forward facing position for children of the correct age, height and weight.  It is incredibly comfortable for my daughter of three, (we used it for a bit as an extra carseat in my sister's vehicle) and I like the fact that you can adjust the shoulder height of the straps from the front so that you don't have to remove the seat from the car.   <br /> <br />In short, the Alpa Omega Elite is a great car seat in the forward facing possition, but absolutely terrible, bordering on unsafe, in the rear facing position for most vehicles.
B00LK5J73U|3|Mirror is distorted
B009BTHFPY|4|Not bad at all. happy with the items.
B0044UOVP2|4|I purchased these reusable snack bags for my son's lunch bag.  It got extremely frustrating to me to have to open his lunch bag after school to find that if he didn't finish the snacks I gave him, his aid would just put the opened bag back in his lunch bag.  Which is fine, but the bag was never sealed so I would find cheese doodles, crushed potato chips all in his bag which defeated the purpose of sending them back home for him to eat later, plus I got tired of always having to clean out the bag from crushed chips or cheese doodles.<br /><br />I love the bags they have worked perfectly.  They are easy to wipe out, I love the fabric it's sturdy and colorful.
B0049U5UFC|3|I bought one of these and the matching 3 bin cubby, they are suppose to be the same espresso color but side by side they look completely different. Doesnt look good
B009MHXU0O|5|Finally a warm and cozy sleepsack. I have been searching for a thick sleepsack for a long time. Halo sleepsacks are definitely not good for fall/winter nights This sleepsack is fantastic. My son wears a PJ underneath and it keeps him very warm. It is also very soft inside. All in all, finally a great buy, worth every cent!
B004PKJXYK|4|What I find most useful about this bottle is that the feature of a heat sensor (blue is safe and pink is too warm) within the vented tube of this bottle. Previously we had to test the milk on the back of our hand before feeding our daughter. However, this simple feature made it so much easier for us to know the temperature of the milk.<br /><br />As for the other features, with the venting tube collecting air bubbles through it thereby no air goes to the milk is great, as this will prevent my daughter from taking in air while drinking her milk. So far we have used other milk bottles with similar features and they all work great, except when she was teething.<br /><br />We also liked that the bottles are wide-mouth and thus easier for cleaning, although this bottle had the extra venting tube to wash and sterilize.<br /><br />Overall, a great bottle to use when you are in a hurry and try to mix the temperature of water for the milk and it assures you that you are feeding your little one with the right temperature, however, this is not all compatible with some of the Tommee Tippee bottles which I find is a hassle especially if you have already bought other Tommee Tippee bottles. In this area, I prefer AVENT as they are all compatible with their different lines of bottles.
B00M5CUU7Y|1|Want to waste your money? Buy this item...no really...
B000ZYL5ZK|5|My granddaughter loved it
B0000DEW8N|5|This chair is a must-have! All of the reviews I read on this chair before purchasing were correct, very easy to clean, portable, lightweight, a great price!
B0035ER8LM|5|Bought this to use at a frequently visited travel destination. Other than a wheel popping off (easily fixed) this has been a great purchase.
B00H9JJ6PA|5|I've used both Medela and Munchkin sanitizing bags. You pay more with Medela, and you're paying more for the name. The quality is the same as Munchkin. Save yourself some money and go with Munchkin.
B008YIKKZ0|5|I have found the portable potty so handy.  Easy to carry and a very present help in case of toddler emergencies, especially on long road trips.  Great product.  Never leave home without it.
B006V84M1I|4|Great first cups.
B000O7SR36|5|The sheets are so much softer than I was expecting! My son love them! I wash them a few times already and they are still look brand new. I would buy definetly buy extra!
B00PO8W52E|5|This is the only tool i use to shorten my baby's nails. I own several pairs of clippers and the Joy Baby electric trimmer and nothing is as good as this.
B0013RRNLI|5|This swaddler, along with Hylands Baby colic tablets and pacifiers are FUNDAMENTAL for newborns!! We've used all three twice now and they've saved our life! (An infant swing is also KEY) ;)
B0017SFKF4|5|Compre la chamarra en color azul y me gusto mucho el diseño y que es delgada. Muy buen producto por el precio que pague, ademas la talla estuvo perfecta. Sin embargo por la foto pense que estaba comprando un conjunto de chamarra y pantalon y no fue asi, solo era la chamarra, pero por el precio no hubo problema.
B0034ZI4ME|5|Very soft. Love this blanket. Silky inside soft outer perfect for days where baby needs a light blanket. This is the blanket to give to baby as their favorite blankey!
B003HS5JPI|4|This rattle is cute and soft. The different textures and bright color on the backside are great for baby's development. The downside is the rattling itself. It doesn't seem to be loud enough to attract my 2-month old.
B00B1M2PQS|5|I absolutely LOVE this swaddle. My 4 month old sleeps literally all night long when we swaddle her in this. It's super warm and amazingly soft. I would buy another in a heart beat if we needed one and would definitely purchase these as baby shower gifts.
B00UGV8CLW|5|Love the quality and absorbance!
B000FFL58Q|5|My kids love this!
B002CN5E22|5|Everyone that I know who is  having or expecting a baby I buy a Cloud b Gentle Giraffe.  Everyone I have given one to loves it, parents and baby<br />.  Great product..
B000HKYKT0|1|It was uncomfortable and scratchy and I never got the hang of using it and noticed I did not produce as much milk when I did use it. I would not recommend.
B003GUBVYA|5|The Shop and Play Shoping Cart Cover is wonderful.  I love the convenience it provides and the roll-up/store feature is great - it is always in the car without taking up space and being cluttered.  My granddaughter loves it!!!
B002V92XRQ|5|This tray is so easy to use!  My baby eats finger foods now for lunch and dinner.  This tray makes it easy for her to see what is available to eat and the sections cause her not to be overwhelmed with choices.  Right now, at 14 months, I use only three sections since she is not a big eater.  I also love that you can cover it.  It goes to Grandma's when Grandma takes care of my girl while I'm at work.
B0011MOVOW|4|The item was wonderful except that the packaging was terrible and the item came open and dirty.I would suggest picking it up at a retailer rather than ordering from amazon. The cost of having the material professionally cleaned so it was appropriate to put a baby in was more expensive than it would have cost to drive to a retailer and pay more. I tried to make a complaint about it but there is no one to call. No numbers and no customer service to speak of.
B005647QAM|5|I really, truly believe that our Amber a Teething Necklaces are helping my son through cutting his first two teeth. What a difference they have made.
B00648JQ2A|5|We were looking for an alternative to plastics as they often leach unintended chemicals to children.  We found these things, made out of corn. They wash great in the dishwasher and by hand. They are easy, light weight, and my daughter has really enjoyed eating all sorts of meals out of them. She's 22 months old.
B0031KMAJK|3|As others have noted, this crib is cherry in color.  We knew this beforehand and it was one of the reasons why we chose this crib.  We ended up receiving three of these cribs, as the first two had cracked pieces.  We actually had to mix and match parts from two shipments to get one functional crib, and we still ended up having dented pieces.  Thus, I would recommend ordering this well in advance of when you would actually need it.  The assembly was pretty straightforward, and once it was put together it looks pretty nice.  My little one is 9 months old, and she occasionally pushes her leg through the slats and has a difficult time getting it out.  Just something to watch out for.<br /><br />Pros: Looks nice, affordable.<br /><br />Cons: Poor packaging during shipment, Cracks/dents easily.<br /><br />Purchase price: $250<br /><br />Purchased from: Amazon (received as a gift)<br /><br />Recommended: Only if purchasing locally from store and can inspect it first, not having it shipped
B004A910UG|5|We love this stroller!  It turns on a dime making it so easy to maneuver in stores.  There's plenty of storage underneath the seat.  I attached mommy hooks which adds even more room to hang bags or purses.  The wheels are durable and easily survived a stroll down a rocky road.
B004EBUX9E|4|Absolutely safety is most important, which other reviews will attest to, so that aside; what I love is the pattern (Dixie)!  Super cute for a girl and may just buy this again, for our son to use - just kidding, we'll get him the black one!!  Our daughter likes how comfy it is for her, too...lots of cushion in the butt! :-)  Totally agree w/ other reviews on how the seat belt doesn't easily glide through when buckling, compared to other car seats we've have/had.  I figure there could be worse features/issues with this car seat and there are not! Therefore 4 shiny stars for this product!
B0043RQJQU|5|This wrap is so cute and I loved wearing it with matching nails! Haha My only other wrap is plain black and I like how this one didn't seem as hot. It was breathable and my baby really enjoyed it. She's getting bigger now and too mobile. But on occasion when she's in a &#34;hold me&#34; mood, I can still place her in it.
B00009P7I5|5|This was the third monitor that I tried, and I think this one is great.  The only concerns that I have are that the lights don't really correspond with the noise.  If a car goes by, the noise isn't really that loud, but the lights go all the way up.  If the base is too close to the receivers, you'll get noises, but that's the only problem I've had.  Sometimes switching channels on it will cause me to hear my neighbor's telephone conversation, but I switched it back and it was fine.   <br /> <br />I love that it has 2 receivers.  I have one in my bedroom, and another in my den on the other side of the house, so I can always hear the baby, and I don't have to move them around.  I also like the fact that I can hear my son breathing...that's how sensitive the monitor is.  I love it.
B0037TS7RY|4|Very satisfied with purchase. Would consider using this seller again.
B00L4MJEC8|2|Great to clean, but collapses when you squeeze it and becomes loose. Would not buy again
B000Z6VSSC|2|the joints don't stay together well so the mobile ends up falling down on the baby's face.  and the bracket, where it's attached to the crib, keeps moving around.
B008EHUPQ0|5|Worked great. Happy with my purchase. Would buy again!
B00AWQIXGK|4|My daughter uses it for a crib in their small apartment
B004X8GJPA|5|These liners are genius! They are made from a plastic similar to that of a grocery store plastic bag. The genius part is the fact that they have an absorbent pad in the bottom of the bag to soak up any liquid. Then you can just tie the bag closed and toss. At first I thought they were expensive for 30 disposable bags but it's well worth the price to not have to worry about any mess. They are perfectly made to fit on the Potette Plus Potty Seat so you'll want to buy these bags for that potty to avoid any mess. Love them!
B00DYOQNNM|5|Can handle heavy bags, water jugs, great for diaper bags.  The velcro is strong and the green part is non slip.
B006PB2B3W|5|I am very pleased with this product.
B002UHJV6U|3|I really love the colors of the mobile, it matches the Pottery Barn bedding we bought. What I don't like is the music it plays.  It is VERY SLOW and off tune.  It sounds more like music from a scary movie than soothing music for a baby.  Just a bit odd b/c everyone comments on it.  With that said we may return the item.
B002SZH45E|4|Works great! Gets a lot of mucus out!! Doesn't really getthe hard/ dry boogers as well but it does work great ootherwise!
B000066CMV|5|I received this pump in 1999 from my sister as a gift.  Our daughter, Cecilia, was in the NICU.  She passed away and I stored this pump in the box until 2002, when my son was born.  I used it for 6 months - and yes, it cracked after 6 months of using it after I returned to work FULL time and pumped 3 to 4 times a day.<br />I purchased another pump and was VERY upset.  I emailed Avent USA - wanting the replacement.  Within 12 hours they replied that they would send me the replacement part.  Within a week I received the part & a sippy cup for my son!<br />While pumping for our daughter - I found this to be better than the electric pump and it increased my production when it was decreasing.<br />I have breast fed/pumped for 3 babes - I hope my experience can tell you AVENT is a wonderful product!  Has wonderful service and WORKS.
B005UV0UEA|5|My wife and I got this for our (5) month old. It's perfect! Highly recommend. We love to travel with it.
B000YDDF6O|5|Baby has been loving this since he was 3 months.
B000MW1FMS|4|I gave these ,as a party favor for a bridal tea party and everyone really enjoyed them. Well made and very unique. I only wish they were bigger but that was my only complaint.
B000FTD1OI|5|The crib is beautiful!  We like the \\"old school\\" look of it.  It's very sturdy.  A little difficult to understand the assembly directions if you've never put together a crib before.  The standard size mattress fits into it perfectly.  The drop side is easy to operate - can drop the side with your foot or your knee - doesn't require 2 hands.  The baby will love it!
B00BKV0O68|4|Baby seems love it expect it gets him sweat a lot. I guess all convertibles have the same problem. Wish there're some new materials or widgets that can help adjust the temp.
B003IP8RRM|1|These were awesome for about the first 2 days, then they stopped working at all. My 6 month old got through them. Now the sticky part is stuck to my furniture but not stuck to the actual device. I was really disappointed by these! I can't get the sticky stuff off without taking the paint off of my furniture which I wouldn't mind so much if they actually did what they were supposed to do.
B000BXHPEU|4|This folding potty seat will fit any toilet.  Any reviewer who says otherwise is probably not doing it correctly. It sits on top of the seat and outside in the front, so it doesn't matter the shape of the toliet.  The seat seems a little flimsy and it does slide around a little bit.  However, it works and it keeps my little one from touching the toilet with his hands, which he does when I use another potty seat.
B0042RU2SW|5|We received this as a shower gift, and it's one of the first toys I've used with my baby from the start (mostly for tummy time then). She's 7 weeks now and is making more eye contact with the toys and smiling at them. I love the gym because they built so many sensory functions into it. Some of the leaves on the mat crinkle and squeak. Most of the dangly toys do something, whether they rattle or play music. I also love that I can set my daughter down on the mat and she can entertain herself and exercise for about 15 minutes while I do quick chores nearby. Definitely worth it and I'm so thankful to the person who got this for us!
B004044LD4|5|Very nice, lightweight and easy to put in and out of my portable crib.
B001J6H8MW|5|My son like this ball .
B000JVZWY4|4|This stool is perfect design and price for my little man.  He specificly uses it for in front of the toilet and it gives him perfect height to keep accidents to a minimum.  The only problem - all the colors shown in the picture were primary colors - any of which I would have been fine with - but the one that came... was pink and purple.  My husband said to ship it back, but for a $10 stool, I would have paid more for shipping than it was worth... so WORD TO THE WISE... BE PREPARED YOU MAY NOT GET ONE OF THE COLOR COMBINATIONS PICTURED.
B0033B9CZ2|1|It needs to be made clear that this product is NOT by Medela. I thought it was from the same manufacturer, but it's not.
B00C8OSBQ6|5|Perfect
B005ZBFNBU|4|I absolutely love it!!! My back doesnt hurt, easy to use. My lil one and I feel safe, we did a 3hr hike when she was 2.5mo old in it and it was fine. Never used the infant insert she was too tall. Shes 6mo old now, we have only used it with her in the front not on the back yet. Love that it is organic cotton. The only negatives thus far, is that there is no pocket/pouch for cellphone, money, id, etc. and it should come with teething pads:( I would definitely recommend this. Oh my husband used it for the first time and did well. Easy to adjust sizes. Oh I really like how you can roll up the straps securely so they are not hanging down. Foxie is a great unisex carrier.
B00IN8OJ30|5|Made of great teething material. One end has soft gel bristles. This is a true teething toy.<br /><br />YES Recommend!
B00PX8PCKW|4|Great stroller and car seat. I love the purple color.
B00B1HEUBG|5|So far, so good.  The picture quality is phenomenal.  I'm hoping it functions for a long time as it is a replacement for one like it that broke.
B000KN0M7S|4|I bought these when I couldn't find the type I already have with the center suction cups for a good price. These have the suction cups on the ends, and they do dangle loose which causes me some irritation when trying to attach them one-handed quickly. The advantage to the dangle suction cup method is that you can hang it at a corner of a window and sort of prop the lower end onto the dash and swing it out of the way or back into place as you need to see things better. They don't completely block out the light, so you can still see through them like my center suction cup shades. One advantage to the end suction cup placement is if you suction one end to the upper side window and leave the bottom of the shade unattached, you can lower the side window almost all the way down and not disturb the shade.  Disadvantage to this shade: Some of the suction cups seem to be a little deformed so sometimes they don't suction adequately enough and have to be wetted to suction.  They're OK, they work well enough for the price.
B00I0OZBFM|4|I love this diaper bag -- the design is cool but not too girlie (daddy doesn't mind carrying it), it has so many pockets sectioned off to make it easy to carry all of baby's things.  My only complaint is that it has magnet closure when I wish there was an actual snap/clasp/buckle or something as it often flops open and doesn't stay closed, but other than that we love it!
B000JVXZF2|5|Other than that it is an inexpensive booster seat, which is what I was looking for.
B001AQLGO2|5|This is a perfect. I have had so many people stop me and even take pictures of this. I have 3 children all under 4. This has turned my double bob duallie stroller into an extremely function able triple stroller. I walk about 5 miles a day with my children. This has been perfect. For a very reasonable price. Assembly was not easy for me but was very easy for my husband who is in construction.
B00LIRJ03W|2|not hot keeps food warm for more than two hours , even following the recommendations of the manufacturer
B002EA2IPE|5|Ii have recommended this item to my coworkers  They seen the boys room and liked it. Great great great great
B003HS5JMQ|5|I love this backpack.  I got it because my daughter was moved into the pre-toddler room at daycare andthey keep their stuff in backpacks.  This fit on her perfectly, although it threw her off balance so normally I carry it.  It's very thick material so I see it lasting for quite some time.  Super cute and we get lots of complements on it.
B00EWVTEAK|5|Cute cute cute!!!! My daughter is almost a year old and fits great!
B002JLUKO4|4|The insert is well made, sturdy and with lots of pockets. It has a firm bottom so it less flexible when fitting it into a purse, was larger than I expected so has not used it yet since it did not fit in the purses I was planning to use it in. If you are using a very large purse you will love it.
B00C4ZC106|5|These reusable pouches have been a savior! I can fill them with whatever I want and the best part about it is I know exactly what my kids are eating, there's no hidden ingredients in my purées. My kids love yogurt in these pouches as well. I have even filled a pouch with peanut butter to squirt onto my apple for myself.  We take them with us on the go all the time, really convenient  for our busy schedule. The pouches have an excellent seal and are a cinch to wash. Such a simple purchase makes me feel better about my contribution to help the environment too. I'm always excited to share these pouches with others, they are my go to birthday gift. Keep em coming GoFreshBaby!
B00008439C|2|Ok, perhaps you can't hear a pin drop, but the highest volume on this machine is still pretty quiet. On second thought, that may be a good thing since the sound choices on this unit are all pretty unpleasant - very mechanical sounding at best, and the \\"womb\\" choice sounds like the background to an alien invasion movie or something. I am totally disapointed with this cheap looking, low quality item.
B000LEVVCQ|5|This is BY FAR the best jogging stroller on the market.  Here is what I like about it:    - Very smooth ride  - Excellent turning radius and very stable on turns (front wheel can lock straight or not)  - 5-point harness fits both my 4-week old and my 26-pound toddler equally well  - Comfortable ride, the kids sometimes go to sleep in it  - Made with high quality materials, nothing on it feels cheaply made  - Very light for a double jogger  - Does not pull to one side when I have only my older child in it  - Each kid has their own canopy, and it comes far down so no more pinning blankets to the canopy for my sleeping newborn to keep the sun out  - The kids aren't crammed in there, there is room to be comfy  - Stable on neighborhood walks or running the Town Lake trail here in Austin; great on all terrains I have tried it on  - Fits through most doors and doesn't seem huge    What I don't like about it (very little):  - Have to get the handlebar console and rain shield separately.  For the price of the stroller, these accessories should come standard.  - Not all that easy to transport although it does fold easily and isn't heavy. It just doesn't stay folded up that well.  If you're buying this as a frequent traveler, it might not be for you.    Overall I am very happy with this stroller and wouldn't think of getting anything else.
B00LXB8Y3U|4|These work really well for heavy soakers or overnighters.
B005XJ2VGE|5|We are very pleased with our purchase!  It rolls smoothly, is the perfect height and we plan to use it for years to come!
B009PQZIIE|5|This is a fantastic buy if you are needing a sturdy playpen, bassinet, or crib for your baby.. We travel a lot!! We have an rv and a home we bounce in between due to my hubby's work, we like staying together.. I'm a smart shopper who likes a bargain and I don't waste money BUT I HAVE purchased three different play yards before being content with this one and now realize the first two were a waste of $$.. I Baught a regular size one first, that was a bassinet and then a play yard when child grew=was to large in size, next I purchased the arms reach co-sleeper=was great for a lilbit, has storage underneath BUT what they don't tell you is IT DOES NOT turn into a play yard, it only designed to be a bassinet, I studied this item and others for about two months online in order to decide which play yard/ bassinet would suit us best and never even noticed this. It appears to be a play yard type just like all the rest, until my baby girl of 6 months started pulling herself up to standing position while in it at the bassinet height, so I said no problem it's time to lower the floor of the bassinet to play yard position =never happened it is sewed in one position (bassinet) it's ok, but I felt very betrayed because it is not advertised at all as ONLY BASSINET!! They leave that info out..... So I'm happy with the time I had with it, but would have been much happier having purchased this graco one in the beginning, This play yard is Great!! It's perfect as a bassinet for a newborn and then you it's a cute play yard or crib for your older baby, It's sturdy, pretty, it's a perfect size and in no way appears cheap, it is definitely designed well, it's even easier to put up and to break down and the price is totally fair and nice!!!!! FYI - this is the first review I have ever written and l took the time to do so because I'm so impressed with this product, Thx GRACO!
B00006IJRU|1|I purchased two of these bottles, and returned them the next day.  My baby could not get anything out of them.  I tried sucking on them myself and at first nothing would come out of the nipple, then I could somehow get it to work, and then it wouldn't work again.  I called playtex, and they told me the baby's mouth has to be above the little lines on the nipple.  I tried everything, even another nipple, but it was useless.  After dealing with a worn out (and hungry) baby, I would have to say these are useless.  I find myself pretty bright when it comes to figuring things out, but this bottle was beyond my ability.  Feeding a baby should be simple!
B00GZFNHOA|3|They say that the top is sealed so that it's sterile, but I think it's a pain to have to tear off the top every time I use a bag.  It also doesn't stand on it's own as easily as some of the other storage bags.
B000P97ET6|2|these things are really a pain to use. they don't fit right in the bottle, and they leak.just use the drop ins and save yourself the trouble!
B000056HNV|5|Great Crib mattress!!
B002J4U8OI|2|I agree with the other reviews I've read on Amazon about this product. The buttons are hard to press for a baby although my son has discovered that if he closes the lid that trips the \\"Mode\\" button so he just does that over and over. Between this and the mirror it seems to keep my son fairly entertained.  The product is supposed to teach colors both in English and Spanish (written and spoken when the appropriate button is pressed). However, the button for Orange indicates that Spanish word is \\"naranja\\" instead of \\"anaranjado\\" (they gave the word for the fruit rather than the color). Issues like this just seem to indicate an overall lack of attention to detail in the design of this product.
B00V8HLW1U|5|Great company and great product.  Boat this boat for my son to play with in the pool and he loves it.  We just ordered another boat to have races.  The remote control broke by accident and the company is sending out another...they really back their products.  Moving forward this is the only toy company I will use when ordering online.
B005WH3RV0|5|Easy to clean (as far as a cloth seat can be)<br />Fits in the back of my not-large sedan<br />Baby seems really comfortable in it<br />Easy to get baby in and out<br /><br />Baby  insert cushion is great for 3-4 months and older, but I don't think there would be enough support for a newborn.
B00AM5NTIS|5|Exactly what I expected.
B004ZH2UE8|3|This is a good safety feature, I definitely feel like it would put pressure under my belly should the worst happen, rather than squish the baby. However the fabric is suede-like so you can't slide into the car because it grips your clothes. Also very slow to fasten every time.
B000CSBP3G|5|👍
B004G8QNAI|4|I have used the Halo sleepsacks since I stopped swaddling my 20 month old - so for the last year or so.  I love them because you always know they have a blanket on. The feet openings actually drove my little guy nuts though. He wanted his feet either in or out and he couldn't get either done by himself.  If you want something they can walk around in,  this is great, but realize that your child may not be a total fan if they are picky about their feet.
B00AO083KU|2|My son loved this for the short amount of time I was able to use it. At 3 months my baby was 14 lbs& on the highest speed it would just barely glide. Would not buy again.
B0079EQA18|5|Provides additional space for drying the nipples and rings for all the bottles that we go through during the course of a normal day. Works great with the lawn to get the smaller pieces up in the air so that everything dries quickly.
B005DOS2EE|5|This is the best temporary gate I've ever used. It looks great, its easy to install, and sturdy too. I attached mine to studs in the wall for extra support.
B002YQ3ZEG|5|A coworker recommended this changer and it has been a lifesaver. My 7-week old daughter pees on the changing table a lot and we LOVE how easy this is to clean. We have the baby blue and it is becoming very slightly discolored but I will probably try to clean it using the tips from other reviews. Regardless it still looks fine and is so convenient, would recommend to any friends having babies.
B000YDDF6O|5|great
B001D74FOQ|5|These flannel crib sheets are worth the price!  They are soft and warm.  I checked other flannel sheets, but they weren't warm and not much fabric to them.  Highly recommend these to anyone.
B0012IZAFY|1|When we got the set it already had stains on it!  Soho's return policy is only 7 days and they're only open for 4 hours a day 5 days a week.  so if you miss their little window your out of luck!  DON'T buy anything from this seller!!!! Oh! and it is light blue and a BRIGHT LIME GREEN not a pastel grayish green as it is in the picture!
B002SSEMWO|5|Great surprise gift idea for grandparents, well made
B00KW8ORTA|1|Extremely poor China quality. I have passed the return date policy although it is unopened. Very disappointed!
B00DU6J47G|5|I checked this product out at a local &#34;toy store&#34; and then checked other reviews online and decided to purchase it for a friends baby shower.  I did not use it personally but did asked my friend how was its performance and she said it was great!  She really liked the fact she can view her new born on her iPhone, iPad or TV.  It was also much cheaper on Amazon!
B002WB2G9I|4|Really love this stroller! We got it as a second one that is more suitable for quick trips.<br />Although it does stink if you quickly need to use one hand (lol), it's perfect.<br />Compact & my 2 year old loves it, too!
B008RWD99C|5|We tried 3 days with it and 3 days without it and it seems like the days without it was horrible! I love this product!
B000WU3DVG|5|I bought this booster seat because it was recommended in Toddler Bargains, and I haven't been disappointed yet.  It's easy to get my son in and out of, and very easy to clean.
B002YGSXF2|5|This a great item. It fits snug on all our sippy cups. No more stinky milk cups under my car seats!! Love this for going to the mall or zoo. I have lost many cups in the past. No matter how you pull on it the velcro hold strong!! A must have if you have little ones
B00AYY6CRC|3|Half of them did not work correctly, as my child just pulled them off the wall. Yes, I followed the instructions.
B0042QE65I|4|I haven't gotten to use it yet but the shipping was quicker than the expected delivery date and it's bigger than I expected. As a teenage girl, I already love the bag even though I have not begun to use it. The design and color–everything!–is just so cute; how can you NOT love it?!
B000YS3FO6|2|While I am grateful to have a mattress not filled with toxic chemicals for my child's room, unfortunately this mattress is not comfortable. It would have been more descriptive if this mattress were listed as being a hard mattress. We bought it for a trundle in hopes that guests could sleep on it, but we'd never let a guest sleep on something so uncomfortable and now have to spend more money on an alternative solution.
B00FZGLMCY|1|Honestly, I did not understand how to use this? I followed directions but it says the put one packet in a case and attach it under the diaper genie lid, but its a sealed packet, how is the good smell supposed to come out? When I actually opened a packet, its just a bunch of granules that don't even have a smell? Waste of money, I'm sorry! Wish I could have gotten a refund :(
B0025Y6742|5|This works great for the kids' lunches.
B00HDODQIY|5|We have a lot of cups at our house. My kids are getting to where they are old enough to fill up their own sippy cups, but that's dangerous because I don't know if they screwed the lid on the right way or tight enough. I love these Nuby cups because I have trained my kids to listen for the click! They know that if they don't hear it then they need to unscrew it and try again until they do (or come get me to do it for them). They have gotten really good at closing these cups thanks to the click and I can be confident that the cup won't spill. Great idea adding the click for peace of mind! I also love the soft straw. My baby learned to use a straw with these cups since the straw was soft I knew it was a safe option for him. Love them all around!
B001AATP3W|5|We have had our DadGear bag almost a year now, and its still the bag we use the most. Having the built in diaper wipes is my favorite feature. I also love all the little compartments that help me keep organized. I can keep enough diapers in here for a day trip with my 1 year old and 2 year old, with extra clothes for each, sippy cups and snack. Plus I have the zipper compartment for soiled clothes so nothing else gets yucky. Also, being able to use the built in straps to attach is to our stroller is great, and even with smaller umbrella strollers, the weight of the bag doesn't pull them down. Don't hesitate to buy this bag. I will never use another.
B000M4XVDW|5|We bought this stroller last year and have used it now for a full year - it is worth the money - it has held up exceptionally well - we use it to jog and walk with on concrete, asphalt & dirt roads. We also use it for everyday - it folds up nicely and I can pick it up easy enough and load it in and out of our car.  We bought the accessory bar to use with the infant (Graco snugride 32) car seat and we also bought the accessory for the cup holder - I recommend both of these. I am so pleased with our purchase and confident that this stroller will be going strong through more than one child.
B004WOZMQ2|5|This is my 2nd, for our 2nd girl. So cute and comforting. Just buy one.
B00083D754|5|My babe loves it! Easy to grasp.
B000CNMUQC|5|Love these potty seats!!  The cushion is soft and comfortable and my kids always use the handles.  The handles are adjustable.
B00746WUEW|3|I tried all of the suggestions written by the other reviewers to get this plate to stick in a way that my 14 month old would not be able to unstick it...and unfortunately he learned how to break the seal on the suction after his 2nd meal with this plate.  It is a cute plate though, and the design is adorable.  Hopefully it'll be more useful once he learns to leave the plate on his tray.
B00O10L87O|5|These baby teethers are great! I purchased them for a friend's child after I received a promotional code. I was very impressed with the material. It's very soft and flexible, and yet is also very durable, so that a baby can comfortably chew on them. Many of the teethers that my daughter had were either very hard, or soft but flat, so she wasn't able to really get a good bite on them. I don't think this will be a problem for my friend's baby! I will definitely look into giving these as baby shower gifts in the future!
B003SZPEFA|5|we were just simply very pleased with the product
B004XOK0OA|4|Granddaughter thought the chair was great.  Now her brothers can teach her when they get home from school because she has her own desk!  It went together smoothly, easy to clean and she Loves it (the most important)!
B00ER7502K|3|Im giving it three stars because Im sure it will work for someone out there just not me. All of the chairs I have are too tall and my baby just ends up hanging instead of sitting and its very time consuming to strap her in especially when shes hungry. I am returning it.
B0093JQCGK|5|Sturdy, lovely and easy to assemble ( for my husband). I like this crib so far. The only &#34;con-&#34; I can think of is that bedding set ( bumpers and diapers bag)  do not really fit. You can barely tie the bumpers' strings to the crib's rails. The diapers bag simply can not be tied to it.
B004L2JJAK|5|Love the size of this. Was a little larger than I expected which I am happy about. Haven't installed yet, but seems straight forward.
B003DA5TH8|5|Love these covers. extra cute and leak proof. my son is 4 months and 18 lbs. we have tried a couple other covers and these are the most comfortable for him and havent had a leak yet. love the velcro and the snaps.
B00003TL7P|5|I received this as a baby gift and it works great. I have not noticed any smells, and my baby has had some pretty smelly diapers.  It holds more diapers than some of the other diaper pails and has the greatest advantage-- no expensive refill bags.  It uses regular trash bags.  I suggest buying scented trash bags to even greatly decrease the chance of smells.  It is a little tricky to open, but once you figure out how it's not bad.  Just push down on the lever rather than trying to pull up.
B003VNKLIE|5|Great product and easy to assemble!
B002WN2B6O|3|I purchased this very large sterilizer for second baby due in a month and just used it for the first time for a test run. I'm not sure I can get passed the amount of water that remained on each and every item I just sterilized. I suppose I should have anticipated leftover water but this was a lot. I do not mind whipping out the bottles but all the little things will be quite time consuming. A dyer of some sort would have been a nice option. I currently have a dry heat sterilizer in my older son's bathroom that I use for medicine cups, droppers and his toothbrush and still works after 5 years. It's shallow however that's why I choose this model.<br /><br />I'm concerned about all of the people that mentioned it stopped working after X months for me to keep something I'm not so sure about. Having said that, very few people seem to find this water issue a deal breaker so that does count for something.
B00JA9I4VY|5|Bought this as we were limited for space in the nursery. It fits perfectly on the stork craft dresser<br />Well made... Would buy for others in the future having a baby<br />Nice gift and well made
B005JCPL8A|5|VERY CUTE
B0044R7I00|5|We bought this chair for our 2 yr. old granddaughter after receiving one for our home that is similar.  It is very well made and my husband was able to put in together in about 30 minutes.  She uses it without the tray and having the straps to fasten her in is a plus.  It cleans up easily and when her younger sister is big enough she will probably use it with the tray.  This can easily be used for a long time...our 5 yr. old grandson still uses it when he comes to visit.  It is easy for little ones to step up on to themselves because of the height adjustable foot step.  I would highly recommend it.
B005DOS2EE|5|A wonderfully designed fence/gate systems.  We have two of them in our house to keep our two Golden Retriever puppies sequestered where/when needed.  A very flexible design.  The ability to quickly disconnect one end and fold it flat against the wall on the opposite hinge is great.  The hold-open option for the gate also works well when we want to keep the gate open for extended periods..Quite expensive, but in this case you get more than your money's worth....<br />As I'm sure the warnings will tell you, DON't use this at the top of stairs......
B007OQP6A2|5|Super cute & I love that it has the added Styrofoam around the head area. Works as intended, fits well in my Saturn sedan with a big kid booster on each side of it. I have a total of 3 carseats in my small back seat & this one works great! My one year old loves her seat!
B004K6LMW0|5|Works great with water bottles...my grandson is always wanting everyone's water bottle so when I saw this on Amazon, I knew I had to get it.
B003UERRCC|3|This bag is well made but I expected the background to be white as it appeared that way on my screen. It is not white but more of a cream yellowish color that looks dingy. I returned the bag.
B00BPIKJF2|5|It fits my 18 month old perfect.
B002XZKY7O|1|I purchased these bibs based on the size and price.  I was truly disappointed when I felt them  They are very stiff and rough.  I would never put them on my baby's face.  They have a very odd texture and I don't know if they're even absorbent. I haven't tested it yet.  At the same time I purchased the same type of bibs by JJ Cole and they are very soft and absorbent, I would recommend those.
B0000DBHHR|1|I bought this gate years ago for my toddler.  I was unable to extend the gate myself and it was a difficult feat for my husband a well (maybe ours is a dud).  Our purpose was to pressure mount for occasional use.  Once we got it opened we didn't dare close it down for storage so it became a big issue to find a place to store it when it wasn't in use.  As another reviewer stated the plastic feels flimsy, but my little one certainly put it to the test pushing on it and it never broke, so despite a flimsy feel it seems sturdy.  I knew that pressure mounting it I would not be able to swing it open.<br />My son is now 4 and no longer needs a gate I had given up on this one a while ago and collapsed and put it away.  we have company with a toddler coming soon so I found this gate stored away it was when I tried to open it I remembered my former plight.  This time my husband was not able to extend the gate either.  After a short period of both us trying together we gave up and just threw the thing away.  Again maybe ours is a dud as no one else has mentioned how difficult it is to extend, but being unable to extend the gate makes it pretty useless.
B0002JETOM|3|Great price, a little flimsy but it worked... until my jack russell started jumping over it. Some dogs might not even try, but I have an 11lb russell/eskimo mix and he doesn't even hesitate anymore. Buy with caution I guess, at least it's not very expensive.
B005DVU0J2|3|The product' color I received is not exactly the same as what it looks in the picture. But it's ok. The quality is just so so. I wonder if it is safe as a baby teether.
B002F9MUM0|3|We are using these to freeze one ounce cubes of our own baby food.  The product works as advertised, BUT it's very hard to get the frozen cubes of food out.  I don't like soaking it in hot water around the bottom b/c that melts part of the cube and defeats the purpose of trying to freeze bulk one ounce portions.<br /><br />The method that I've found that works is to flip it over and on a clean counter (or cutting board, plate, etc.) firmly hold the two short ends and bend the tray in the middle until you feel it give, meaning part of the cubes have broken loose from the silicone wall.  Flip it back over and figure out which row broke loose by gently bending it back wards again.  Once you've identified the row (usually it'll be the middle row of three cubes), flip it back over and firmly grip the tray on the long sides and use both thumbs to press hard on the center cube that is loose.  It may take a second, but the cube will eventually break loose from the other sides and you'll be able to push the cube about halfway out.  Flip it back over, grip the cube that's halfway out, and wiggle and pull on it until it comes loose.  Flip it back over and repeat until each cube is out.  It takes a little bit of time, but not that much and you get nice frozen cubes instead of partially melted runny cubes that make a total mess.
B00FW43E3E|5|Love this combo totally recommend it!! Can't remember exactly on how long it took to arrive but definitely wasn't more than what they said it would take.The padding on the car seat is amazing, it also came with a free pacifier! The stroller is very nice as well and easy to set up to connect the car seat to it. Love everything about it..light and easy, no hassle what so ever!
B000MGQE7A|2|Just got these today and I don't know in who's universe this is double stick tape, but not in mine.  I spent 15 minutes trying to peel the 2nd backing off.  I like the corners themselves, but I'll be buying my own tape.  I can see how a child would be able to pull them off unless they are really stuck good. Maybe super glue....
B004OR1DT2|5|Our daughter loves this chair. We started her in it when she was 6 months old. It's molded enough to be fairly supportive and seems to make her quite comfortable. She's happy to sit in it for mealtimes as well as just to hang out when I'm fixing dinner. It easily raises to counter height, which lets her see what I'm doing when I'm preparing meals. It's also easy to adjust downwards to table height, so she can sit at the dinner table with us and be at our level, which she also loves.<br /><br />Clean up is super easy- it just wipes clean with a damp cloth. The webbing of the harness is very smooth and tightly woven, so it actually wipes clean pretty well. The only thing that looks like it could really collect food is the harness buckle, but so far we've avoided that by keeping it under her bib. I like the fact that the snap on trays are smaller than the typical high chair tray because they easily fit in one side of our double sink- I can set the whole snap on part of the tray in the sink to rinse it off. The snap on tray covers almost all of the main tray, so the main tray usually just needs a quick swipe with a damp sponge. I also like the fact that the pommel is part of the seat and not the tray- my daughter is still pretty secure in the chair with the pommel and harness when I pull the tray off at the end of the meal. Being able to have her sit there securely without the tray make it much, much easier to clean her up. The wheels are another nice feature- I just wheel her to the sink for clean up at the end of the meal.<br /><br />Some reviewers have complained about the brake, but we haven't really used it because the base is so heavy the chair really isn't going anywhere without some effort. We may need the brake more when she gets older, but for right now, the chair really stays put on its own. The brake does seem sufficient when I have used it.<br /><br />Overall, this was the perfect replacement to the Chicco Polly chair we had inherited- the Chicco was overly complicated to use and a cleaning nightmare. This was one of the more expensive chairs I considered, but now that we've been using it for a couple of months I feel it was well worth the price.complicated to use and a cleaning nightmare.

B00069BV8A|5|We took the potty on the go to the Strawberry Festival where there is nothing but the REALLY DISGUSTING porta pottys avaliable (you know the ones--big and blue and stinky).  I just closed the lid down on the disgusting PP put the CLEAN pp on top of the lid and had my nearly 3 yr daughter use her CLEAN PP, with no problem.  Also used the Clean pp at the movies and the mall.  light weight and easy to carry.  actually she carrys it in her back pack-no problem.
B000LZFZVS|5|The product came to me well and on time, without any problem, I'm already using and it works perfectly, totally recommend.
B00NWGWILS|5|Great bed
B00PTL46J6|5|Well built, leans back to keep child head back while sleeping. Good size cup holders with variable storage pockets. Fully adjustable mounts with attachment variations. One down side its a little heavy for moving from car to car but tolerable.
