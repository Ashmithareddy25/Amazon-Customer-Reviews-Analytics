0553269631|5.0|A friend recommended this book to me and I will be forever grateful to him for doing so.<br />Set in a small southern town in the early 40's, it follows the lives of all the people who come into contact with one man - John Singer.<br />Singer is deaf. And everyone in the town feels that they can come to him with their troubles and thoughts. Their dreams and hopes. And each one sees Singer as a copy of him or herself.<br />No one sees Singer for who he really is.<br />There is only one person who Singer needs. Only one person who sees Singer for who he is. Only one person who understands Singer. Antonapoulos.<br />But Antonapoulos isn't well and is sent to live in an asylum.<br />As each one of the characters come to Singer and sees their reflection in him, each one is a little less lonely. Each heart is a little less burdened.<br />But for Singer, who has no one to understand HIM, he becomes more lonely and more isolated. And finally, when Antonapoulos  dies, Singer realizes that there isn't anyone else in the world who can understand him. Who can listen to him. Who can love him.<br />I thought this book was incredibly sad. All the people were so concerned about having another person listen to them and love them. And I kept thinking - what about spirituality? What about God?<br />It seemed to be the missing link in every character. There was no promise. No future. No hope. Just the doldrums of living everyday without anyone knowing you. Without anyone understanding you. Witout anyone loving you.<br />It was beautifully written, it remains a true American classic. But it made me very sad for all the characters in the book who couldn't seem to see beyond the here and now.
B0000524E5|5.0|Well, at the beginning of the movie I thought what is going to be so good about girls on top of the bar dancing, which I might add is one of the reasons I didn't go and see it with my boyfriend. But as I started watching it I loved it I just wanted to get up and dance along with Jersey and all of the other girls. Kevin was a hottie and I felt so bad when we found out that he didn't have a home and had to be moving around every 2 yrs. The music was great and after the second time watching it I felt that I knew all the words.I loved it and am looking foward to getting the soundtrack when I get my money from working. Well Thanks so much for listening and I hope to see a sequil.               Sincerely
B00005KJ1G|5.0|If you're looking for a type of music that can make you feel alive and puts you in the new and dangerous territory of high end vocals, screaming guitars and amazing harmonies... this is for you. The power of this amaizing album has no paralel, songs like battle hims are nearly a clasic on the heavy metal ground. This is true heavy metal, no pretensions, just powerful music.Enjoy!!.
0790734850|5.0|At first glance this movie obviously has something to do with a nice, big, juicy plot. Even though it doesn't seem apparent at first, the great writing and great actors reveal the full story of what's going on. You'll be second guessing yourself as to what is going on, so seeing this movie is a good idea, if you're not going to buy it. <br />It's really something to watch multiple times, you understand more and more how everything just perfectly fits together. The writing was done meticulously, I haven't found a flaw yet.
B000056NX5|5.0|I wrote a review for Jesus Christ Superstar VHS and I still say that Jesus Christ Superstar is a life-changing muscial.  It changed my life forever, honest!  Glenn Carter is an amazing Jesus, and there is no one else who could play a better Judas than Jerome Pradon!  And if you prefer the original movie version, I would suggest that you see this version to compare and to just see Jerome Pradon in action as Judas--he's the reason why I got hooked in addition to clever lyrics and great music!  And of course with DVD you get different, cool features: movie trailor, actor profiles and &quot;the making of&quot;, which Superstar all includes plus some more.  And also, you can pause the DVD to get nice mug shots of your favorite actors or stop the action right in the middle for a cool effect--like Glenn Carter throwing a TV!  It is worth every penny!
B00005AAFS|5.0|I thought Sehnsucht was going to be their best CD, but now that I've have Mutter, they are the two best CD's I have. Rammstein obviously has talent. They have to talent to put out 3 great CD's. I think it is worth having, and if people say it is Neo-Nazi, they're wrong. The CD is called Mother. I know for a fact they are very concious, none of the songs are offinsive in any way, I can speak Garman.
B000002OVJ|3.0|I used to think the remastered version of Live at Leeds was an improvement over the original LP, which was a classic in itself. That was, until I found a copy of the bootleg &quot;Live At Leeds Complete.&quot;  The problem with the remastered &quot;Live At Leeds&quot; after hearing the boot is obvious: the original tapes were tinkered with. Entwhistle overdubed new vocals and bass parts, as did Daltry and possibly Townsend. The boot features the entire show, which includes ALL of &quot;Tommy.&quot; As a double disc, it's over two hours of primal, undubbed, unedited Who (&quot;Shakin' All Over&quot; contains an entire part where they go into &quot;Spoonful&quot; that is edited out of the remaster!<br />Alan Wright
B00001NFCY|5.0|This is just an awesome album! I love all the songs; they're all so good! But, I still like their first album, My Own Prison, better. That album is more hard rock and I seemed to like that one much more for some reason. Depending on your tastes, you might like this one or My Own Prison better. *shrugs* They're both good, in my opinion. I can't wait until they come out with their 3rd album (November 20, 2001)!
B00003CXP1|5.0|Excellent interpretation of what loneliness &amp; lack of hope can become;  SO raw, so intense that you can barely take your eyes of the screen.  Aronofsky swings between two parallel stories with the SAME meaning so smoothly that it seems like an italian opera.  He interprets what you can make the center of your life...it can be drugs as it can be HOPE.  Excellent effects, excellent sounds (the airplane one is awesome!).  Jeniffer is a delight of natural beauty &amp; an incredible actress (Knew it from ROCKETEER).  Leto is a natural gem;  I believe that ELLEN BURSTYN deserves an OSCAR for her roll(she was soo intense &amp; realistic).  This type of movie is what defines THE ART OF CINEMA...Shaping feelings &amp; thoughts on a screen.  FOUR THUMBS UP ARONOFSKY!!...Keep it like that and you'll become the &quot;KUBRICK of the century&quot;.
0780624890|5.0|Stylish comic book to movie conversion packed with excellent Matrix-like action sequences and explosive fight scenes by the truckload.  Wesley Snipes is bang on for this role as the menacing daywalker Blade. Great stuff - and there's a sequel on the way.
6302779278|5.0|This was definitely a good movie.Everything a movie fan could ask for is in this movie. Excellent actors and actresses, a good plot, and outstanding music came from this movie. Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston made this movie. Kevin Costner plays the role of a bodyguard assigned to protect a rock singer well played by Whitney Houston. He of course saves her from several close calls. In the meantime a close relationship develops between the bodyguard and the singer. In the meantime an evil person is always lurking nearby to do the singer harm. This proved to be an excellent movie that was entertaining to watch. You will not be  dissapointed.
B000059XYK|1.0|I could forgive the many sins of this movie if it would have just got the soundtrack right.  But as it stands, every time an even halfway decent song starts it either stops immediately or gets ruined by the actors doing something.  <br />Some actors may have chemistry onscreen, but the only chemistry you'll see here is the type that occurs when you mix acids and bases - which is to say everything blows up.  No one is believable in their role.  No one is funny.  No one is even likeable.  How you can take actors of the caliber of Cage and Duval and with the beauty of Jolie and only completely get everything wrong is beyond me.  <br />Maybe if the actors had been ignored entirely with the focus being on the cars the film would have been bearable.  But you never get even the slightest hint that anyone has any love for these cars.  The only passable car scenes involve the Mustang and these aren't worth waiting an hour for.  <br />Others have suggested &quot;Bullitt&quot; and &quot;Ronin&quot; but I would recommend the original &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot;.  It at least has some chemistry between the actors, decent driving scenes, and it never takes itself seriously.
B00005A1PR|5.0|INDIA.ARie, this has been the most inspirational cd i've bought in a long time. I'm 25yr brotha Chilling just collecting music. and I bought India.arie  to Listen to what a sista had to say. she had my undivided attention from the beginning intro to the outro.

B00005B4GU|3.0|Radiohead is a great, innovative band that has never ceased to amaze and impress the hell out of me...until now.  &quot;Amnesiac&quot; was touted as a more song-oriented record.  Though I love &quot;Kid A&quot; and it's spacious brilliance, &quot;Amnesiac&quot; is uglier, more difficult and definitely NOT more song oriented.<br />I love bizarre music, the more ambitious the better, but &quot;Amnesiac&quot; largely fails to speak to me.  <br />I applaud Radiohead for pushing, and pushing hard, but this album is cold and it seems like their trying too hard to be weird, thinking that their pretty much invincible.  They may be, but personally, this is their least enjoyable album since &quot;Pablo Honey&quot;.  <br />Don't get me wrong, I practically worship this band, but I'm also honest.  Check it out if you're curious, but I think you'll find it massively less appealing.  You're on your own with this one, kids.
0345440757|5.0|My daughter had her first baby girl in May.  I purchased this book for her and she said it is wonderful. The baby is sleeping 6-8 hours per night. While awake, she is attentive and content, and takes her naps and feedings very regularly.  The author writes using her English accent and with a good sense of humor, which can help a new mother with the baby blues.  If you are having your first child, I stongly recommend this book.
B000007OY0|5.0|This film seemed like a sure hit: based on a Stephen King story, directed by Frank Darabont, and starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. From what I heard, people were praising it, saying it was amazing, the best film in years. But after I read somewhere that this film was better than The Green Mile, I decided that I had to see for myself, though I doubted it would come close. I mean, The Green Mile was directed by Darabont, was based on a hugely popular King novel, and starred Tom Hanks...it seemed to have everything that Shawshank had, but I somehow felt it would be of higher quality. Honestly, I was wrong.<br />After watching The Shawshank Redemption, I was truly in shock. It was about 40 minutes shorter than The Green Mile, but that did not take away from the movie. Second, Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins did a wonderful job. Freeman played a better role than Hanks, in my opinion. <br />The story is simple: Tim Robbins is accused of murdering his wife and her lover, and is sent to prison. We all know he is innocent, but nobody seems to believe him. As he learns that prison will be his home for the rest of his life, he befriends Morgan Freeman, and a wonderful relationship begins. <br />When I rented this movie, the box said that it had one of the best finales in cinema history. I smirked, thinking that it would probably be a let-down. IT WAS NOT! I couldn't be more satisfied with the beginning, middle and ending of the entire movie. On a scale of 1 through 10, I give this movie a 9.5, whereas I would give The Green Mile a 9. So if you saw the more popular prison film that starred Tom Hanks, and have yet to see 'Shawshank' rent this movie. <br />(It's rated R for violence and very strong language, though it somehow seems appropriate in the prison background.)
B00005B4GU|5.0|An amaizing new album, thanks god there are still bands out there able to make music without compromises.<br />In the 70's bands like King Crimson , Pink Floyd , Yes and others gave us a reason to listen &quot;inteligent music&quot; , hidden inspiration for all this new bands , like Sigur Ros , Godspeed and others and for some others to carry on , like King Crimson ,oh yeah,  still around and innovating.<br />If you are not into this kind of music or you did not know that its roots are so old get ready , there is a come back in the horizon and there are some good acts out there.
0380796090|5.0|If you are suffering a mental breakdown, you need this book! Especially if the breakdown can be directly related to a boyfriend or husband, or lack there of. I have bought this book multiple times for heartbroken girlfriends, I gave my copy away, and, unfortunately, its time to buy another copy for myself. You will relate to the need to neglect yourself by spoiling yourself with alcohol and occasionally throwing the Vodka bottle at the wall. You can live in this book. You will try to slow down your reading so that it will last just a little longer, and most likely read it again.
0380973650|4.0|Storm has spent three years in prison, the only thing keeping him sane is the thought of returning home to his wife. Days before his release from prison, Storm learns his wife has been killed in an accident. Alone, Storm ventures back into the world with the goal of making a better life for himself.<br /><br />On the plane ride to the funeral, Storm will meet the mysterious Mr. Wednesday. Striking up conversation, Wednesday proposes that Storm come work for him. Storm, not knowing what to think about Wednesday, refuses, but after serious thinking, he takes Wednesday's offer, even though he doesn't really know what the job entails.<br /><br />As the two men begin their working relationship, Storm comes to realize, Wednesday is a man with a lot to hide, and his schemes will lead the two men on a cross country road trip that will have them come in contact with many twisted individuals... individuals with knowledge about Storm's past.<br /><br />As Storm becomes deeper involved with We!dnesday, he will come to find out that his past won't die, and even his beloved wife had secrets.<br /><br />Storm struggles to understand everything that has happened to him, and at the same time a war is being fought, and losing the war will change the world as we know it.<br /><br />'American Gods' is a very hard novel to describe; at once it is road novel, while having gothic overtones. It is a mystery, with an offbeat cast of characters, that of which would be found in an Elmore Leonard novel, and still Neil Gaiman has maintained a fast-paced, entertaining read.<br /><br />Although not for everyone, 'American Gods' succeeds on being a highly original, readable tale, one that is filled with myth, magic, and mystery that will hit the bestseller list's, and introduce Mr. Gaiman to a whole new audience.<br /><br />A very enjoyable read.<br /><br />Nick Gonnella
B00003A9QI|5.0|This music is incredibly simple yet equally complex.  Aside from the gorgeous glimpses of New England in the fall, I didn't care for the film at all; but (pardon the pun) the simplicity of the main theme struck a chord with me.  Only after seeing the movie a second time and having Portman's music infect my mind for days after did I feel the need to add this CD to my collection.  Portman's score is very emotional.  I suppose the beauty and draw of any good movie score is its ability to transport your mind back to scenes in the film itself.  While Portman's music can certainly achieve that end for a listener in such a frame of mind, it also stands alone quite well and can serve, in a sense, as the score to one's own life.  The emotions of wonder, love, loss, turmoil, and joy that Homer experienced in the film are universal.  As Portman's score appropriately paints the backdrop to Homer and the others' experiences in the film, it also resonates deeper and causes me to reflect a bit on my own life.  Don't just listen and let the music fade into the background as you do some other activity -- let listening be the activity.  You will smile!
B00004STW3|3.0|I don't understand why so many people trash it. This movie is by no means hilarious, but it is cute.<br />The all star cast was an interesting touch. I mostly found it funny because after the aliens have zapped almost everybody in the movie, congress (or whoever they were) still thought there was a chance that the aliens were friendly.<br />I am not a fan of Tim Burton whatsoever. In fact, this is ONLY Tim Burton movie I like. I have recently seen Sleepy Hollow and hated it with a burning passion. Knowing this, I wasn't too sure about this movie, but the plot sounded interesting.<br />If you have a boring day and need to kill some time, this movie really isn't so bad. It's NOT the best thing ever, but I would rather watch this than many other movies.<br />It's just a rip on old sci fi UFO movies, and has a light sense of humor. Nothing more than a parody really.<br />More of just a cute movie than anything else. I still love the guns the aliens have. They look like squirt guns!<br />Try it out and see what you think. The worst thing that could happen is you wasted your rental cost.
B000002HO3|5.0|I kept hearing Holding Back everywhere I went and I love it and that's what made me by the CD.  But then I listened to some of the other songs and I became a life long fan.  I had it on at work and when Money came on I realized that I must have been typing 150 w.p.m.  And everytime I hear Something Got Me Started and he does that little groan I have to throw water in my face.
0767802659|1.0|The film is a total misfire. The attempts at satire are delivered with the subtlety of a atomic bomb. The acting is insipid. The screenplay a total wreck. The direction is a crock. The only reason to watch the film is for the effects work. The rest is trash.
B000003BE4|5.0|I'm giving it five stars because it's their best effort of this early period in their history - a period that ends with the release of &quot;Aftermath.&quot;  The original songs on this album are phenomenal including &quot;Satisfaction,&quot; &quot;Play With Fire, &quot;Under Assistant...,&quot; and &quot;The Spider And The Fly.&quot;  The covers are well rounded with their various influences and the band seems to have found itself a comfortable spot to build upon.  It's curious how albums were released back in the day, where the fickle taste of the public was combatted with the constant production of new albums so the popular bands of the time weren't forgotten.  So the Stones produced a glut of albums in a few short years and it proved quite a learning process, one which we can listen to over and over and begin to see how subtley the band gelled, the songwriting became stronger, and these five fellows became the greatest rock and roll band ever.  An excellent study in what the Stones were all about in their formative years.
0380778556|4.0|Ok, so I'm only thirteen. But this book displayed great detail and almost brought you into the the whole setting and gave you a great idea of what the author created these characters to be. An extremely well written novel about love, deceit, jealousy and truth that deserves to be read by many.
B00005B1W5|5.0|I didn't know what to expect when I put this DVD in my player. I had never heard Yanni's music before but my brother told me it was a MUST HAVE. So I got myself a copy too and let me tell you that this is a MASTERPIECE! Yanni breaks borders and boundaries in this remarkable concert filmed in India's Taj Mahal and Beijing's Forbidden City.  All the musicians are truly gifted and there performances really add something special to Yanni's compositions. If your looking for the ULTIMATE concert DVD look no further! A previous reviewer complained that there is a slight pause (or \\"freeze\\" if you prefer) during one of the songs. This is because the disc is DUAL LAYERED with the layer change occurring right on the beginning of the 4th song. It is quite a good change that doesn't interfere with the overall flow.<br />  With the Concert and Additional documentary spread over a dual layered disc the results are a superb picture quality that is clean and sharp. I won't complain that it isn't widescreen because what we get here is a high definition fullscreen picture free of noticeable defects. The Sound is also incredible! Included is both Stereo and Dolby Digital 5.1 audio tracks that are clear and well defined (and not \\"over cooked\\" as one reviewer claimed).  Also included is the documentary \\"No Borders, No Boundaries\\" which takes an intriguing behind-the-scenes documentary on the making of Tribute and Yanni's travels throughout these two fascinating countries. Bonus features also include a recent interview with Yanni and footage of the artist at work in his state-of-the-art recording studio. <br />Overall this disc is reference material even down to the animated menu's that are some of the best I've seen! You have to get this DVD and witness the musical genius that is Yanni!!
0393312836|5.0|Fifteen-year-old Alex lives in a world where crime takes over at night.  The government/police dont do much about it, and while Alex roams the streets, just looking for &quot;fun&quot; (yes, apparently it IS fun to bash peoples' heads in) he eventually kills an elderly lady and is arrested.<br />In jail, he puts forth a false attitude that he wants to change, and so he is the first &quot;victim&quot; of a new government program to reverse the mentality of criminals.  For a fortnight he is forced to watch gruesome videos of people being killed, of the German concentration camps, of a world of evil that he once took part of.<br />When he was released, he went back home to find himself replaced by his own parents. He then saught shelter with a man that he once tried to kill, but instead gained respect for him.  When he stayed in his house, the man put forth the attitude that something awful had been done to him, but he was really the man who pushed for it.<br />Eventually, all the effects were reversed, but nonetheless Burgess has created a remarkable novel here.  Throughout the story, Burgess tinges the plot with his own made-up slang such as you would &quot;viddy&quot; a movie or watch a movie. Its quite interesting at times and also through out is the line &quot;So whats it going to be then, eh?&quot; which is quite interesting. Overall, wondeful book and I loved it, had that 1984 feel, but that wasnt nearly as good. The slang can be difficult to get used to, but you do, and want to talk like it afterwards, really gets you in the feel for things.
B000002U82|5.0|When I listen to this cd I am reminded of what is missing in today's version of Floyd - Roger Waters!! Without him they are only a shadow of what they were. His influence is everywhere here, songwriting, vocals and his trademark bass work, even tape effects!! Not to mention his pure imagination and just overall creativity. This album was an immediate classic and stayed on the charts for years!! The music is very trippy and was always considered to be best listened to while under the influence. Money is my favorite track; but there isn't a bad cut on the album. It has a wonderful cohesive flow to it. Not a bad job by the rest of the members of the band either......
0451191153|5.0|Ms. Rand has created a wonderful novel in The Fountainhead.  Its a beautiful symphony of a struggle of a man facing the beliefs of a modern world while still standing by his own ideals.  Howard Roark is a man who mankind should take after.  I really dont know how to put it, but he is everything that most people aren't.<br />Throughout the book, Howard's strengths are enveloped with drastic comparison (if thats what you would call it) with his &quot;friend&quot; Peter Keating. Peter will do what ever his client wants from him as a young architect and he has done everything in his power to make sure that he succeeds, even at the price of others.  Howard on the other hand will not sacrifice what be believes in, and thats what brings him down.<br />Howard loved the work of the architect Henry Cameron, and when he was expelled from art school by not making traditional Gothic or Greek homes, he went strait to work for Henry Cameron.  Cameron was a once famous architect who believed that whatever has been done in the past, should never be done again, so he designed totally modernistic structures.  This came under much scrutiny and praise as he was called &quot;untraditional.&quot; He was eventually destroyed because &quot;Men hate passion, any great passion. Henry Cameron made a mistake: he loved his work. That was why he lost.&quot;<br />When Howard applied the same principals, people werent sure what to think, and he reclined great comissions for the most wealthiest people. However, man didnt see his great line of ideals and he was labeled as an egotist, and people set out to destroy him.<br />As the story progresses, we see Howard as a man who doesnt hate. He cant particularily, but he does have his beliefs.  And that is what makes this book wonderful.  The entire story is philosophical, and it becomes slightly overwhelming at times, but Ms. Rand makes a wonderful story of it.  The story ends in a dramtic climax at a trial where Howard testifys everything he believes in.  He brings up the case of Altruist vs. Egotist. An egotist is one who gives up others for self. He creates, and is a creator, he made the wheel and everything else that has allowed the others to succeed.  An altruist is a person who gives up self for others. He is the parasite, and doesnt use his brain, he punishes the egotist for making that wheel, and then uses it himself for personal gain.<br />Again, this book really broadened my outlook upon society. I have been quite interested in philosophy and this book really helped me see what man can be like. This is one of my favorite books of all time and i highly recommend it. The afterword is also quite interesting, before or after you start reading of the book. I loved this book and its highly recommended to all who can actually read the 700+ pages without being frightened.
B00004SCX6|5.0|I like this cd WAYYY better than the first.  She sounds so much more mature on this album.  Also, the songs acutally makes some sense then the other ones on her first album.  I like Britney Spears and this album cuase she is not afraid to do what she wants.  She has put up with a lot of ... people has given her, with the rumors and ... liek that.
B000001ESP|5.0|I bought this last month and this is my first 'Rush' album. I liked it so much that 'Rush' is already one of my favourite band. I will soon buy more of them. The highlight of the album according to me is 'superb instrumentation in all the tracks'. It's nice to listen this album with your headphone on. Sound effects are heavenly great and the whole theme is presented with an unforgettable style. I found some similarities with 'Deep Purple' - (another band with superb players) while the instrumentation is concerned. Everybody may not like Geddy Lee's vocal but everybody should like the wonderful work done by Neil Peart (lyrics and drumming). To me 'YYZ', 'The Camera Eye' and 'Tom Sawyer' and 'Red Barchetta' are all 10 on 10 tracks. 'Witch Hunt' is a little week in my opinion. Buy it, it's real good rock album.
B000059H99|5.0|&quot;Rocky&quot; is one of the great classic films that stands the test of time. This is an original, entertaining and captivating movie. Instead of using large, complex brushstrokes, it makes a great story out of ordinary people. Sylvester Stallone gives a great performance as Rocky, he's not some brute tough-guy, he's just a nice guy who is suddenly given a big chance at his sport. The screenplay by Stallone is an authentic and intriguing journey into the world of boxing, and the side storylines do not interrupt the film's structure but flow along with it. There is also sweet, uplifting romance with the story of Rocky and Adrian (played by Talia Shire, sister of legendary director Francis Ford Coppola). The boxing scenes are exhilarating and exciting, especially the final boxing climax at the end. Overall, &quot;Rocky&quot; is an inspiring movie because it gives hope that people can get a chance at big things, that we can strive for more, and if we work hard and use our minds, we can excell. &quot;Rocky&quot; seems simple, but has strong things to say at its core. It is one of the great sports films, but also a great drama and romance. It is classic filmmaking done with style, focus and energy.
076790382X|5.0|This collection of essays, written for a newspaper magazine supplement gives Brysons wry observations on American life after returning there after 20 years.<br />Whilst I find the book hilarious, I should point out that these essays were written for a British audience, and as such have a tendancy to poke fun at the American way of life.  If you are prepared to laugh along, then you will enjoy this book, but some people may get a bit defensive.<br />Bill isn't being particularly harsh about American culture though, it's his general style of writing - if you read one of his books about Britain or Europe, you will find that he is similarly critical, though as always, in a humourous way.  (As much as us Brits like making fun of the US, we are also very self-depreciative, and find it amusing to read about our own quirks and eccenticities).<br />As well as making fun of US Culture on occasion, he is always ready to point out the genuinly charming aspects of New England life.
068484267X|5.0|This book is reccommended by Stephen King in &quot;On Writing&quot; - a book I highly reccommend.<br />Frank McCourt's &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; is a wonderful literary accomplishment.  I was deeply touched by the story (as I have an alcoholic family-abandoning father, too).  <br />The prose is rythmic and soothing, and the stories are a wonderful tapestry of life.  There are moments when the failings of the people around Frank make you wish you could reach back in time and slap them.  There are moments of laughter and tears, and throughout the book you cannot help but root for Frank as he struggles to keep his family and himself sane during the hardscrabble life they lead.  <br />I reccommend this to all, however, if you have trouble with rambling sentences or dialogue with phonetic colloquialisms, you may be better off seeing the movie - which is a perfect compliment to the book.<br />The ending leaves you dying for more, however, I found &quot;'Tis&quot; to lack the heart and the hope of &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot;  Also of interest, Malachy McCourt has also written two books on his related life.<br />I delayed reading this because I dislike sad stories, but this one is really a story of how a family's love can light up the darkest corner of the world, and how that love never leaves you, no matter how imperfect it may be.<br />Enjoy.
0060273224|5.0|Sabriel is fabulous. It is my all time favorite book now, or maybe together with its sequel Lirael. Garth Nix manages to capture and create a world so real and intriquing, i could not put this book down until i was done, and it is written so that young adults and adults like myself can thoroughly enjoy this masterpiece. I have never much liked morbid storylines, but this book's dealings with the dead and necromancy was so mesmerizing and unique. Garth Nix is a true genious and i recommend this novel to anyone.
0671024256|5.0|I just finished this book, and I recommend it to all (except my mother, because it has strong language).  Whether you are a writer or not, this book is touching and heartwarming.  As you read, you will probably feel as I did; I felt as though Steve and I were at Starbucks, gabbing over a macchiato.  He speaks honestly and frankly about his life, the good and the bad, and offers up real, practical, and encouraging advice for writers.  The back features a list of suggested reading, which I have attacked furiously.  (Please see my website for more info).  <br />I highly recommend that you read this book, and share it with a friend. Although I -am not- a fan of most of Stephen King's work (except the Green Mile and the Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon), I treasured the encouragement and advice therein.  I have a newfound respect and admiration for him and his work.  A mandatory summer read.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Damn, did McCartney ever top Penny Lane or Paperback Writer??<br />These are truly great songs.<br />I would, however, like to know why &quot;Please, Please Me&quot; wasn't included in this set. It was a number one in England, and is a far better song than, say, &quot;From Me To You.&quot;<br />Still, though, brillance abounds. Great music from masterful songwriters.
B000002AOZ|3.0|Otherwise a great musical and artistic testimonial from a quaint era long gone (and sadly missed), this recording is hampered by hollow vocals, a cheap sound, and all around weak production. The recording, and the artist, deserved better. Was it produced by one of her many enemies? Sure sounds like it. Never-the-less, here-in lies a great collection of pop songs delivered with both dignity, AND alacrity. Despite the unparelled success of the number &quot;ITS TOO LATE&quot;, the standouts &quot;...earth move...&quot;, &quot;...natural woman...&quot; and, &quot;You've Got a Friend&quot;, lend depth to a recording that is as much an historical document of 70's zeitgeist, as it is a pop-rock venture.
B000007O9L|4.0|<br />This is not an 'unplugged' release, but is instead the Rolling Stones stripped of all frills.  And it works.  The CD is a bit heavy on ballads, but the no frills approach brings them to the listener with an emotional rawness that cuts through the jadedness of thirty years of arena rock.  It's also cute (how's that as a word to describe the Stones?) to hear them stumbling through Bob Dylan's \\"Like a Rolling Stone.\\"  \\"Wild Horses\\" and \\"Dead Flowers\\" are done to near-perfect effect, especially Mick Jagger's sneering mockery on \\"Dead Flowers.\\"  Nowhere better than this does Jagger demonstrate that fronting a band is a lot more than singing the words to the right tune.  His whole tanging bearing makes this song replete with mocking and loathing.  And their take on Robert Johnson's \\"Love in Vain\\" is as gorgeous as I think the Stones will ever get.  It's an epiphany to hear Jagger sing delta blues both this close to the vest and this well.  (But they've got to give Robert Johnson credit in the notes.  This '(Adaptation and new words by M. Jagger/K. Richards)' (crud) is disrespectful.)  Their use of their back catalogue is hilarious.  When I first heard Jagger's change of the line 'She looked about thirty' from 1965's \\"The Spider and the Fly\\" to this CD's \\"She looked about fifty\\" I howled with laughter.  The Stones are great, and can legitimately claim to be the greatest rock band in the world (even if I think they're wrong), but it is their sense of humour and ability to not take themselves too seriously that make CDs such as this a treasure.
B00005B36H|4.0|While maintaining their overt 20's something sensabilities, Keenan and Co. are actually producing real rock. Haunting, surreal, and full of surprises, Tool stands nearly alone as a sunspot in the otherwise blightfully bleak soundscore of 21st cen. rock. The plasticine liner presentation is a bit atavistic, but few of the fans will even know what I'm talking about. I used to have one of those skeleton books too! I look so forward to seeing them live! Cool.
068484267X|4.0|Next time your teenage kids tell you lifes not fair open this book at any page and read.  Frank McCourts childhood unfortunately is typical of the tough religious hard upbringing in Catholic Ireland in the 1930 and 40's.<br />Unable to make a go of things in America the family return to Ireland.  His mother is downtrodden, proud but often desperate, his father a drunkard, not so much violent as absent, and just as likely to spend the weeks wages on Guinness as food.<br />Autobiographical but written almost in story form, the book is breathtaking.  McCourt has the knack of bringing bad news at such alarming regularity, that you accept it.  You can almost feel the cold, and share the hunger with them.  Considering the subject matter and some of the events it is not a sad book, just a great one.
6301963717|5.0|This is not just another mafia movie.  It is interesting and full of surprise twists throughout the movie.  The main character is a gutsy loner type.  The music in the movie is quite good. There are several interesting characters in the movie and I like it because it shows strategy and development of character, not just shooting like other movies of this type sometimes do.  This movie will excite you, amuse you and is one I highly recommend to watch over and over.
6305313687|4.0|Excellently shot in both colour and black and white as the story moves backwards and forwards. Danny is a teenage racist, why, because his older brother Derek is, as was there father before them.  Each one becoming more blinkered earlier in life.<br />Essentially the story is in 2 parts.  It is the story of Dereks racism and how it lands him in jail and how Danny idiolises him.  Whilst in jail Derek sees the error in his ways and must attempt to show Danny the futility of his bigotry before he too ends up in trouble.  Danny sees this as selling out and is not keen to be converted to sensible ideas. A powerful film, moreso for the black and white prison scenes, it hopefully carries the message that racial violence solves very little.
B00003CXRM|4.0|I didn't believe I would care much for this film and because I  assumed so, I didn't see the picture at the theater.  When released on DVD, I took the opportunity to rent &quot;Oh Brother&quot; and &quot;had a ball!&quot;  The cast was perfect, Clooney was excellent, the plot was hilarious and the music was terrific.  I never imagined the story was actually a loose (depression era) representation of Homer's &quot;The Odyssey&quot; and, as such, was fun to spot the similarities between the two journeys.  &quot;Oh Brother Where Art Thou&quot; was a very enjoyable movie.
B00003CXQY|1.0|Similarly to only a few other writers, I would like to draw attention to the poor quality of this particular dvd release. I have seen several Disney dvds with problems such as sound and video skipping, poor transfer quality, and failure to run at all. This release is no exception! I've tried two different copies on different players with problems every time! If you share this disappointment, let Disney DVD know that you actually care that your movies play correctly. Maybe then they will put some time and money into the quality of their future dvd releases.
B00005IC2H|5.0|I conjure up images of icebergs and grand landscapes when I listen to this Icelandic group's brilliant cd. There's a picture of a foetus on the cover that doesn't look quite human, encapsulating the embryonic and alien feel of the music. The band sings in a language called 'Hopelandic'. The translation of the lyrics is irrelevant, though. Words cannot do justice to the voice the lead singer possesses, it makes you feel like the loneliest soul on Earth. This cd for the most part drifts languidly on a celestial mix of sparse post-rock instrumentation: droning guitars, string instruments and organs. I didn't take to this record immediately but once I did it stayed in my cd player for days. Face it, if these guys sang in English, they'd be huge.
0440224764|2.0|I have read many of Grisham's books and found this the worst.  It was the same general plot as the Firm but with a terrible ending.  If his character was smart why didn't he place part of the money in a joint account.  He wouldn't have to know where it was and if this girl was so in love with him, why the ending. I wouldn't pay the money to watch it as a movie.
B00003CXRP|3.0|Cast Away (so-called because Nicholas Roeg had already used the title &quot;Castaway&quot; in a somewhat better movie), should have taken place inside the mind of Tom Hanks.  Robert Zemeckis hadn't the skills to pull that off.  So what we're left with are the physical details, daunting enough in themselves, I suppose.  For me the best moment in this overwrought film was when Hanks has finally found a way to leave the island.  He rows for all he's worth into the unforgiving waves, and looks back at the island that was his home for four, albeit terrible, years. Hanks manages to register enough requisite sadness at the sight of that island disappearing into a squall of rain to make the film almost a success.  But then the script-writers took over.  Tom Hanks is by now far better than the scripts he is submitted.
0451163532|1.0|Boring, boring, boring. The writing style of this book is dry and dull. It sounds like it was dictated by Perot. With all the high marks that readers have given this book, I can only guess that they are all EDS employees, or Perot himself.<br />Its nice that these people were resuced, but nothing heroic really happens. They wait in a hotel till the prison is stormed. Then they drive across the border. What else could they have done. Perot should have probably pulled out of Iran earlier. <br />Perot is always negitive about goverment, but he owes his fortune to goverment contracts.
B00005B36H|5.0|This album illustrates that tool continues to progress and create great music that sounds like no other band out there.  &quot;Lateralus&quot; is full of unique basslines(schism, the grudge),creative riffs(lateralis, disposition), and an array of hypnotizing vocals(parabol, reflection).  Putting aside the fact that it lacks a true radio song, lateralus is in my opinion the best album we will see until tool's next offering.  This long awaited and highly anticipated collection is the first offering from tool since the masterpiece &quot;aenima.&quot;  You won't hear songs like &quot;reflection&quot; or &quot;schism&quot; on any other tool album, which is exactly what the band was shooting for.  The eerie finger picks of &quot;the patient&quot; and the power vocals of the epic &quot;the grudge&quot; are what makes this album a five star piece. Well worth the wait!
B00005B36H|5.0|There is only one word that can explain this album,amazing.Well, maybe unique,creative,artistic,beautiful,ugly,heavy,light,mind-boggling,intense,and so on.So there is a little more than one word,even though some of these adjectives will contradict each other.When listening to this album be ready for a total trip into the dark and sometimes very frighteniing world of Tool.Carrying intense lyrics to go along with his amazing voice Maynard James Keenan proves his vocal geniusity.His lyrical contributions are what helped shape Tool from the begining and what carried not only Tool but his other band(NOT a side-project) A Perfect Circle.Many times he plays lyrical tricks on the mind to almost control it so that you can see the world like he does.The tracks on this album are all long but don't let that fool you,this isn't a repitious or dragged on album.The album is amazing and powerful.The key to the heavy sound of Tool though lies in the two guitar players,Adam Jones,and bass guitar player Justin Chancellor.Using powerful riffs Jones unleashes a lead guitar thats not so lead yet not so rythm either.And with the exception of Les Claypool(Primus) and maybe Matt Freeman(Ranicd,yes,Rancid,Have you eve rheard a Freeman solo?),Chancellor is the best bass player in music today.Chanceller produces a hard hitting metal sound that a guitar won't give you.Many times he is the fuel that Adam Jones ignites,then this flame grows even more when Danny Carey does amazing drum solos.Finally that huge flame will explode into a firestorm as Maynard adds his vocals.Carey carries quite a sound to,he too maybe the best drummer in music today,maybe the best since John Bonham of Led Zeppelin.Carey drums like a madman and varies the beat from a speeding train to something slow enough to make you go insane.THis album is incredible and shows Tool's comeback and improvement since their last LP,Aenima.
B00005B36H|4.0|If you are trying to make a choice to buy this album or not, I recomended buying either the first c.d.s this band has put out which are Undertow and Anemia.  But if your a major Tool fan like I am I recomend this album.  Long, dark, and well performed songs make this c.d. come alive.  This album I would give a 4 and 1/2 on the count of some tracks aren't as good as the bands other c.d.s but still an awesome albulm espically if you are a fan of this band.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|Don't miss this movie!  Baz Luhrmann's vision is different than any other director's.  In the same way that Tim Burton's movies all have something distinctly Burton about them, Luhrmann seems to infuse his movies with something that makes them his, even from a distance.<br />Kidman and McGregor both have lovely voices, and there is real on-screne chemistry between them.  Leguizamo is funny and tragic and perfect.  <br />Don't sit in the front row for this movie; it's too big - you'll miss something.  And see it on the big screen, preferably in a theatre that has a good sound system.
B000000993|5.0|Even if you are not a fan of the band, you are not a rock fan unless you have this albulm in your collection.  This is one heck of a c.d. with songs you can't skip.  Even though I am a big fan of Tool please follow my review and take my word on this is a really good c.d.  If you still aren't sure listen to Tool's other c.d. Anemia which is just as good as this c.d. maybe better but still take a look at this c.d.
B00005B36H|5.0|I've been a Tool fan for years. This album does have to grow on you. But when it does, you will be glad you were patient. Worlds better than anything else remotely close to the mainstream rock world.
B00000I8BX|5.0|This is another great death metal CD that Fear Factory has managed to pull out.  I love all of the tracks.  Shock is a great beginning, Obsolete is an awesome way to top it off, and Timelessness is a surprising finish.  My fav tracks are Shock, Hi tech Hate, Obsolete, and Concreto(bonus track).  I still like Demanufacture(earlier CD) more, but Obsolete is still really awesome.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|I went into the movie unsure of what to expect and whether it would meet my expectation of a musical. I was more than completely impressed and added this my list of favorite moviee. But how would the soundtrack fair? I bought it immediately and was almost equally impressed. The music is explosive and moving. There was just the tiniest disappointment that the &quot;like a virgin&quot; song was not included. The rest of the cd more than made up for it.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|I really enjoyed the varied use of popular songs but was really anxious to get the music played during the credits at the end of the movie.  I also wanted the version of Queen's &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot; but both were absent from the soundtrack.  I assume that the ommission of the Queen song are do to some licensing constraints but I thought the music during the closing credits was original.  If interscope plans on releasing a musical score, I hope they include both in the future.  They are certainly worth paying for.
B000002NJS|5.0|After 3 years, I still amaze with this album. The more your listen, the more you feel addicted. Every track is a winner.   My personal favourites are &quot;Ray of Light&quot;,&quot;Swim&quot;, &quot;Frozen&quot;, &quot;Power of Goodbye&quot;, &quot;Sky fits Heaven&quot;, &quot;Drowned World&quot;.  I never understood why &quot;sky fits heaven&quot; was never released as a single. It could easily become a top 10 hit, or even a no.1.<br />&quot;Ray of Light&quot; is a feel good album and I would recommend anyone to buy it. Madonna voice is strong as so does the lyrics and rythm. <br />It's hard to compare with her latest effort as they both are very different,though I must admit, I like &quot;Ray Of Light&quot; much better.  IT's a true masterpiece and it can't get any better.

0767802659|4.0|Many punters watching Starship Troopers will miss Verhoeven's point. Rather than being a slightly post sell-by date space action flick, it's a spoof in the tradition of Zucker &amp; Abrahams, although the slapstick is very deeply submerged in good old fashioned sci-fi hokum: Planet earth faces a barrage of asteroids being flung at it through hyperspace from a species of arachnids inhabiting a planet the far side of the galaxy, but the humans refuse to conceive that the bugs might be sentient, and (repeatedly) get a good pasting when they arrive to teach the bugs a lesson. The funniest scene is when a starship commander suddenly cottons on that the beams of destructive plasma which keep obliterating her squadron are being deliberately aimed and aren't just random!<br />Along the way we meet a set of bluntly-drawn, wafer-thin  characters who have been sucked into enlisting into the infantry by the propaganda of Verhoeven's trademark all-intrusive Government, who get put through the mill in a terrific send up of the traditional Hollywood boot-camp.<br />The characters are too thin, though, and the film doesn't really work on any level except as a spoof, because you can't identify with - or like - them. Verhoeven toys with the idea of a love triangle, but even he can't be bothered drawing it out, and rather suddenly gives up on it half-way through.<br />Not a bad way to spend a rainy evening, but not likely to go down in the Motion Picture Hall of Fame either.<br />Nice special effects, though.
0792156684|1.0|OK, although I'm not a movie expert, I do consider myself somewhat versed in this field.  One of the things I look for in a movie is originality (YES, EVEN IN A TRUE STORY).  James Cameron knew this, and put in a love story on top of the historic event, which was the movie's downfall.  Love stories are fine.  Star Wars has a love story.  It's the type of love story that brought it down;  it took the soap opera route.  Girl fools around with guy when engaged to another guy.  The guy she's engaged, in a jealous rage, flips breakfast tables and slaps her in the face.  Originality?  Bah.  We've seen this stuff before.  Next thing, the screenplay.  The dialogue and plot movement are incredibly shakey.  They call this picture an epic, but we can't forget that scene when Leo teaches Kate to hock loogies off the deck.  When Leo and Kate are being chased, she flips one of the chasers the bird, which didn't enter pop culture until several decades later. The dialogue is stereotypical, with lines like &quot;never let go&quot; and &quot;I'm king of the world&quot; are so laughable in this, the most expensive disaster of the 1990s.<br />P.S.  You'll notice that I didn't even call Leo and Kate by their &quot;character names&quot; because there is no character development whatsoever.  They play themselves, not unlike their good friend, Ben Affleck.
B000002JS8|5.0|Highway To Hell by AC/DC released in 1979 still remains as a constant in any true classic rock collection. Highway To Hell is one of the few albums (by any group in my opinion) where every track is strong.<br />From the opening title track to the last track &quot;Night Prowler&quot;- this album sounds as fresh and new today as it did back in 1979. While it is very difficult to choose the best tunes here- I can only say check out &quot;Touch Too Much&quot;(some of Bon's best vocals!) &quot;Get It Hot&quot;, &quot;Night Prowler&quot; and &quot;Love Hungry Man&quot; (great bass line)- these tunes are my personal favorites off of Highway To Hell. As I stated before- there are no weak tunes here- just some personal favorites.<br />Highway To Hell is a must for anyone who likes great &quot;kick in the head&quot; rock in roll. This album has withstood the test of time.
B000009PNY|3.0|I love tribute albums because they're a great way to hear the bones of a song -- sometimes a bass line becomes a guitar line, or a backing vocal comes to the front, and you hear things you'd missed all these years. That's what I wanted out of this album. As a teenager, I nearly wore through the vinyl of &quot;Black Celebration&quot; and &quot;Construction Time Again.&quot; What did I miss?<br />Unfortunately, I didn't find out much. Too many of these bands reworked the wrong parts of the song. In Hooverphonic's hands, the glorious, pained melody and incongruous dance beat of the original &quot;Shake the Disease&quot; get buried in a haze of boring half-time synth work. Dishwalla slows down &quot;Policy of Truth&quot; so much, it can't rouse itself even for the great chorus - you get the feeling they worked on this version for an hour and put it to bed in three takes. &quot;Master and Servant&quot; loses its sinister edge and becomes a kitschy, sleepy lounge act by Locust. The Smashing Pumpkins defangs &quot;Never Let Me Down&quot; -- there's barely a hint of the power of the original. Veruca Salt makes the fatal mistake of covering &quot;Somebody,&quot; a song that no one else can (or should) sing with a straight face. Worse, they get the words wrong. And no one can improve on &quot;Stripped,&quot; despite Rammstein's industrial-strength attempt.<br />However, some bands get it right. God Lives Underwater takes the chant of &quot;Fly on the Windscreen&quot; and adds a great guitar line and groovy beat while keeping the wacky harmonies that made the song so interesting. Failure twangs into &quot;Enjoy the Silence,&quot; then sends it straight into industrial grunge, a place it's right at home. Meat Beat Manifesto freshens up &quot;Everything Counts&quot; instead of trying to force it its melody and lyrics into another mold. <br />Maybe I did learn something after all -- Depeche Mode's melodies seem so strong, but they're really delicate. A lesser band can't pull themoff.
B00004XOWM|1.0|I must admit that I did like Three Dollar Bill somewhat and Significant Other did have it's high points. Chocolate Starfish is a horrible example of what rap/metal has become. There is no high point either lyrically or musically on Chocolate Starfish- this album is just plain NOISE!!! I'd rather smell someone's foot odor all day than be subjected to this trash again!!
1573225517|5.0|High Fidelity was a treat to read.  Rob, the protagonist, engages on a self journey that is about ten years too late.  The book draws the pop culture fan in by using top five lists and record labels as frequent metaphors to get his point of his own personality across.   The more astute reader, however, will gain a deeper understanding of Rob.  The book does not appear to be so much about pop culture as it is a device to portray his evolution.  Rob begins as an overgrown teenager who is unable to make it &quot;maturity-wise&quot; to the next phase of life.  He needs to gain an understanding of his past relationships in order for this to happen.  It is not until the death (will not say who for anyone who hasn't read it) that he is able to actually progress towards the phase of adulthood (which is portrayed in his ability to interact with other adults...even those who own Tina Turner albums!)   Many will misunderstand the book to be solely about pop culture or his relationship with Laura.  Not so!  As we can infer from the end, Laura is only a means to allow him to advance from an overgrown teenager to an adult.  One can make the comparison of Rob to the Joycean Stephen in &quot;Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot;, as both need external events for them to evolve.  This book will appeal to those who enjoy things on the surface (such as the view of pop culture) as well as those who look for the deeper meaning.  Please also read my review on the movie.  Accolades to Mr. Hornby, I eagerly anticipate reading the next book!
0783240287|5.0|I purchased this DVD because I enjoyed the road show so much which also starred Donny Osmond.<br />Imagine my surprise when my five year old son also enjoyed watching this as well.<br />The music is good as well as the message.  Glad to find this rather rare DVD with content suitable for the entire family!
079070546X|5.0|Plenty of films have been made about that magical season of miracles - a time when people are pressured into being happy and jolly, the suicide rate goes up, and relatives are forced to pretend they like each other. In a word: Christmas. &quot;National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation&quot; could well be the best (and funniest) film about Christmas ever made.<br />For Clark Griswold, Christmas turns out to be anything but a happy, harmonious affair. Everything goes wrong. The Christmas that Clark envisions becomes a holiday fraught with hilarious mishaps, setbacks and disappointments. Nevertheless, Clark is determined to make this Christmas work.<br />Things don't get any better with the unexpected arrival of cousin Eddie.<br />&quot;Christmas Vacation&quot; is a film packed with moments of sheer laughter at Clark's expense. One scene I always think of is Clark getting ready to carve the turkey, with the relatives sitting around the table looking on. It sounds like a common enough picture. But this film takes it to a whole new dimension.<br />If your Christmas is going badly, this film will certainly put things into perspective. This is as close to reality as a Christmas story can get.
B00004X01U|3.0|I happen to be a HUGE Madonna fan, so it hurts to give this album only 3 stars, but I rate on quality. Madonna's latest is not very good. The only songs I really liked were the title track, &quot;Impressive Instant&quot; and &quot;What It Feels Like For A Girl&quot;. The song that I COULD NOT STAND was &quot;Paradise (Not For Me)&quot;. Maybe it was the new producer (Mirwais) that I did not like about this album, maybe the ballad-like songs dragged it down (such as &quot;I Deserve It&quot; and &quot;Nobody's Perfect&quot;). All I know is that &quot;Ray Of Light&quot; was a far more superior CD than this drivel. Madonna's gonna have to do better than this next time. I feel her fans were shafted. This &quot;Music&quot; could've been better.
0316518565|5.0|I guess, in order to create some overarching conflict, and keep the story from looking like one long apology, Leeson had to dwell on the issue of management controls. This, however, would only seem a sound line of inquiry if he could actually prove the controls would have any value, absent his own activities (and questionable character). <br />   An organization as (historically) successful as Barings had been, particularly in an industry as competitive as merchant banking, will dispense a significant amount of discretion to mid-level managers in-order to facilitate innovation and risk-taking, two activities paramount to success in merchant-banking. <br />   Therefore, Leeson can't possibly have been alone in enjoying his level of localized discretion, at that or any other time in Barings' history, though HE ALONE misused it to such catastrophic results. Perhaps, then, the question is not should we check better on our employees' actions, but should we even hire employees that we aren't 100% sure could effectively utilize our level of discretion?<br />    While Leeson apparently acted in order to retain his leadership position, he effectively revealed his inability to lead by: <br />1) Creating a culture, within his office, of sloppiness and irresponsibility. (By allowing employees to utilize the 88888 account, rather than condition them, either by reprimand or more aggressive training, against making so many mistakes.)<br />2) Mistaking his superiors' TRUST of his own abilities for &quot;aloofness,&quot; and thereby failing to properly utilize (rather than ABUSE) that trust.<br />3) Never, ever, ever owning up to his mistakes, or actually devising long-term solutions to his problems (like, say, never using the 88888 account after the first two times he cleared the balances, or simply not putting his OWN trading errors in the account.) ------ All this having been said, however, Leeson's account of his activities, and his flare for storytelling (or his co-author's, duh) make this a sufficiently enjoyable read.<br />Aspiring traders in particular should probably read this story just in order to get a grasp of some trading concepts, as well as a general account of life as a trader (albeit a dishonest and irrational one such as Leeson).

0684800713|1.0|well, I just finished speedreading this book. apparently Ernie liked to drink and drink and drink. I like that. but there are so many parts of this book where they are not drinking. those parts suck. the bull was pretty cool though. and a lot of drinking was going on. what is pernod though? is it like budweiser? this book reminds me a lot of lynard skynard because I get drunk listening to their records. did ernest hemingway ever hang out with lynard skynard? probably. but who knows. but I hate this book because of all the parts where they're not drinking. it just doesn't make any sense. if there would've been more drinking I would have loved this book. but it sucked.

B00003CXDG|1.0|Wow. Amazing. I was so very impressed at how bad this movie was. There were others in the theater that shared my point of view; I know this because I could actually hear them roll their eyes during the ridiculous courtship and expedited consummation of the Cruise and Newton character's \\"relationship.\\" I know this because I heard them laughing during the tedious, overwrought \\"action\\" sequences. And I know this because I heard them HOWL when Cruise emoted his laughable dialogue to Newton before parachuting from inside of the building.<br />A real triumph in bad movie making. Bravo Mr. Woo!!

B000058TDY|5.0|What else can you say?? This is the last of one of the greatest singer/songwriters of the past 50 years.  Cat Stevens' last effort and a great farewell to this stage of his life.
6305841861|5.0|A very important movie, and one of the funniest I have ever seen. One of the few films I enjoy more with each viewing. Jim Carrey obviously took several lessons in physical comedy from Bruce Campbell and this film... too bad he became the megastar and Bruce is still more of a &quot;cult&quot; favorite. Maybe it's cooler that way. Watch the film, and you'll know where the inspiration for the &quot;Doom&quot; video game came from.
B00003CX5P|2.0|Besides the gripping lightsaber duel there is no reason at all to see this sorry excuse for a movie.<br />George Lucas has sold out completely - especially with Jar-Jar. He was always in it for the money, with the merchandising avalanche of the first trilogy. But, at least there were some redeeming qualities in the first three movies. Ep 1 is simply garbage. The countless millions he spent on the boring pod race and the cliche &quot;blow up the big enemy ship&quot; would've been better spent on a script-writer (or maybe a whole team of them). How humiliating for McGregor and Neeson to be tied to such a third-rate production.<br />Save your money and go see The Lord of The Rings this winter- Tolkien's trilogy is a thousand times better - with much more interesting characters, plot and no pander-to-the-8-year-olds Jar Jar character.
B00005A1PR|5.0|This CD is a must have for anyone who truly loves music.  India's music and lyrics wraps around a nice bottle of wine and relaxes the mind on a cool yet sticky New York day. I am happy to be able to appreciate the true artistry of her works.  I suggest a concert of Nubian Queens: India Irie, Jill Scott, Amel Larrieux, and Rachelle Ferrell.  What a GREAT IDEA!!!!  If I do say so myself.

B00003CXS4|5.0|This movie is in two words F@+*ing AMAZING, the story is a little too close to Lock, Stock but it works. it's funny with some of the best one liners ever in a film. NOTHING and i mean NOTHING hollywood could make could come close to this.<br />buy this DVD if its the same as the uk version keep an eye out for the hidden extras the very funny
1559211407|5.0|well, that seems like a pretty stupid heading, since a book thats brilliant at one time will still be brilliant at another.  but i guess thats what 84CCR proves in part.<br />i remember reading this for the first time in readers digest [!] where it was unabridged [!!]  it has always remained one of my favorite ways to spend a lonely afternoon, and serves to remind again how deep love can exist between people who never even manage to meet in person: something that ought to be remembered by the fools who condemn internet relationships.<br />read this book if you want to be touched, amused, feel hugged.  i will always treasure it.
B00004Y87J|2.0|i however didnt and ended up being completely bored for nearly 1 and 3/4 hours.Dont watch this version watch the robert powell version its totally cool.
B000002UA5|1.0|Before you banish me to the ninth gate of hell for not liking this I can honestly say that PF is one of my favorite bands and I never thought I would be able to say a bad thing about them, yet when I heard Ummagumma I laughed out loud. This cd is horrible. A group of small animals...is laughable, as are many other songs. This isnt music this is the sound my car makes when its braking down. Don't buy it it is a complete waste.
B00003CXB2|5.0|This is certainly one of the movies that I would call art. Perfect story, great actors. It belogns to me in the category of Cleopatra, Ben Hur and Gladiator. For a long rainy afternoon exactly the right thing.  And always entertaining again. I like exspecially the added scened that are not available on the standard DVDs or VHS formats
0399146253|4.0|This book is very interesting, but seems to move at a slower pace than previous Kay Scarpetta novels.  The many twists and turns do get a little difficult to follow, but make the book hard to put down.  The crime scenes and autopsies are explained in too much graphic detail.  Read this book if you like good mysteries and gory horror movies.
B00005BL2A|1.0|Don't get me wrong - there's a lot of Depeche Mode that I really like.  But - and this is a big one - this disc is slow and moody.  I greatly prefer the higher-octane stuff.  This one gets donated to the public library.  Look for it there.
B000000HSU|4.0|In a plethora of highly over produced, dumbed down, slacker --EERRRR--&quot;modern&quot; rock, this has been a breath of fresh air, and actually got me interested in listening to music again...H.R. has a voice that you will either love or hate--I'll admit, it took me a few takes to get it---but his lyrics are very intelligent and extremely thought provoking...I love how Dr. Know isn't afraid to show that he can play---and he can...The way the band can shift gears from hardcore to reggae at the blink of an eye is a real testament to their rhythm section...If there's one chink in the album's proverbial armor, it would be the production--I know what I said earlier, but it's a bit thin for my liking (Ric Ocasek did a much better job with Weezer)...I can't give it 5 stars because of that, but the songs and the musicainship give it a strong 4 star rating and besides, how can you not love a band who not only successfully averted mainstream for so long, but boldly and brashly held up their collective middle finger at it?..
B000007S5B|4.0|Although not one of the band's best works, definitely better than 'Soft Parade' and contains some excellent pieces, such as &quot;Spanish Caravan&quot;, where guitarrist Robbie Krieger stands out playing flamenco guitar.<br /> Also worth noting are the closing track and classic &quot;Unknown Soldier.&quot;
6305657939|5.0|This is one of the *few* movies me or my husband hadn't already guessed the ending...it was a complete surprise to us!  Great film and fantastic soundtrack
B000002I2M|5.0|If you're looking for rock in the band's closing album with Morrison (before his tragic death in Paris, later the same year the album got released) you might be a little dissapointed.<br /> This is, in essence, a blues album: a very good one, but a blues album.<br /> There is not a missing piece here: the entire album fits like a glove for any serios blues fan.<br /> You will never regret making it part of your collection. It's one of THOSE albums you cannot afford not having.
B000002GLE|4.0|This is a great, energizing and positive live-record. The Police-songs are even better in this jazzinfluenced arrangements.
B000002I25|5.0|Few times does a band define so well how their sound is to come will be like, with a debut statement, as The Doors did with this, their first album in 1967.<br /> It contains great hits such as 'Light my Fire' and 'Break on through', but the highest point in the album definitely corresponds to 'The End', the closing piece.<br /> Still, almost 35 years later, it continues to be an incredible work of art.
B0000509BZ|5.0|I have always loved this film, but the director's cut is even more beautiful than the American version.  Just the right combination of romance, action, &amp; humor--Sean Connery &amp; Christophe Lambert are the perfect team....
B000002I2G|3.0|Running the risk of getting flamed here, I am afraid to say I disagree with most of the comments made.<br /> I consider this album to be their worst work, out of their studio albums.<br /> I would say only 'Touch Me' saves it...
6305263248|4.0|I really like this movie.  Ronin is about a group of spies/mercenaries who are seeking work in the post-Cold War world.  Robert Deniro plays Sam, an American who is clearly an experienced player in the espionage world.  Sam gets hired by Deirdre, an attractive Irish woman who is looking for a team of mercenaries to steal a mysterious brief case.  Deirdre is played by Natascha McElhone.  There are also excellent supporting performances by Jean Reno, Sean Bean, and Jonathan Price.  The entire plot is shrouded in mystery as none of the mercenaries really know who they can trust.  However, this is more than a cloak &amp; dagger film but an action film as well.  The action sequences are amazingly well done.  This movie may contain the best car chase ever captured on film.  It should be noted that all of the chase sequences were filmed with actual cars, with no computer touch ups.  The action is hard core and gritty.  Innocent bystanders are often caught in the fray.  The only thing this film lacks is a strong love story or any sort of graphic sex.  The focus is more on the goals of the mercenaries and the relationships of these hardened men.  However, it should be noted that Katarina Witt does have a small part.  The movie itself is a smart thriller with a gritty edge.  It is certainly a far cry from a James Bond film.<br />The DVD production is excellent.  The print is relatively clean and I didn't really notice any speckling.  Much of the movie is in the shadows and the dark colors are contrasted well.  I didn't notice any image wash in the shadows.  The sound is nice and full, especially in the action sequences.  The only possible shortcoming of the DVD production is the lack of extras.  There is a director's commentary and an alternative ending.  The alternative ending is insightful, but you'll certainly realize why they cut it from the movie.  I would've loved to see some other deleted scenes or perhaps some comments from the actors.  I probably would've given thisproduction 5 stars if there had just been a few more extras.    <br />On a personal note, I first saw this movie on pan &amp; scan video tape.  A friend of mine, who had seen it in the theater, raved about the action sequences.  I enjoyed the film on VHS but couldn't understand the hype.  I understand it now.  This movie looks completely different in wide screen format and I can't say enough about what the wide screen DVD adds from the pan &amp; scan production.  However, it should be noted that this DVD contains both a pan &amp; scan and widescreen version on alternate sides of the disk. If you're into espionage/noir type films, I cannot recommend this movie enough.
B00004XOWM|5.0|Limp is bound to make a hell of a lot of money off of this one.  I have already heard the One, Rollin', My generation, My Way, Take a Look Around, and the Rollin' remix elsewhere besides the CD.  Limp Bizkit shows more maturity than previous albums (especially Three Dollar Bill, Y'all).  There is a lot less senseless screaming.  Also, it is their most vulgar album.  Overall this is probably Limp Bizkit's best album.
0312853254|5.0|In this sequel to &quot;Ender's Game,&quot; Card does what few thought possible.  He has made a sequel that rivals even the original in splendor.  After reading &quot;Ender's Game,&quot; I decided that no book could even hold a candle to the obvious genius of it.  It is in this book that I am proved wrong.
0553579908|5.0|I find excellently written books all too rare in the Fantasy Genre.  This one and the entire series so far by Martin are wonderful exceptions.  I highly recommend this book.
0767802659|4.0|STAR WARS fans will surely love this film. The visual effects are truly awesum, from majestic space panoramas to creature animations it is just about perfect for this genre.  <br />The plot does, however, require some suspension-of-disbelief by the viewer. I wondered WHY, for instance, in an era of super high-technology are ground based infantry troops even needed when the enemy bugs could simply be nuked from orbit or by some other advanced technique instead of an old-fashioned WWII search-and-destroy mission. Of course, face to face with the enemy insects is the theme so you need to overlook questions like that.  Also, the seemingly totalitarian Earth society does little to elicit much sympathy, and the question of exactly why the bugs became Earth enemies is never made clear.  Most S-F stories have a MORAL--maybe the book did--but it's missing in the film.<br />The film is also a bit too long and could have been edited better. On balance, it is visually stunning and deserving of 4 stars for that alone. Highly recommended for S-F fans.
6304474652|4.0|Salma and Matthew deffinatelly make a perfect couple.  Or maybe not so perfect.  He, talented and educated from New York, meets her, the Mexican beauty full of love to give and passion she holds of her country.  After a one night stand, turns into her falling pregnant, they irrationally decide to get married and move in together.  Without realising their cultural differences affect their 'love'.  Will their marriage work?  This movie is filled with laughs, humor and romance.  Myself being from a different culture I know how hard it can be in relationships. I give it 4 stars...
6302413931|5.0|I finally understood why South Vietnam was lost when Brando's character related the story of Charlie cutting off the arms of children who had received shots from American corpsmen.  This may be considered just a movie but merge this film clip with the pictures of beheaded American Marines published in Hustler magazine and we can get the picture that our Christian ethics have no place in war if we want to win and save our sons lives.  It really is a great film*****
B00000JCB2|5.0|this is one of the best cds ever, i dont see why people dont like it it has a good balance between rap and rock, so all the people who think they sold out can just shut their mouths
0345442989|4.0|Cloak of Deception has the most political intrigue of any the  recent Star Wars books dealing with the time around Episode 1. The most enjoyable parts of this story deal with the maneuvering of Senator Palpatine/Darth Siduous. The numerous plot twists that are orchestrated by the Senator could only be accomplished by someone as steeped in the Dark Side as Siduous. From time to time the story drags when detailing some of the exploits of the terrorist Nebula Front. I would have preferred a little less of the 'action' surrounding them and had a story more focused on the political machinations of the Senate. In the end, though, there is a generally good balance to please many readers. I would have given 5 stars, if I hadn't lost interest during some of the non-political sequence, but that's just me. If you are a fan of the Star Wars universe you will enjoy this novel.
B000002KNI|4.0|I have to admit that I'm biased with respect to this album. This concert - orginally shown on HBO - was the concert that introduced me to this &quot;group.&quot; They instantly became my favorite musical entity and have stayed that way ever since. They are the only group where I own everything they ever produced.<br />That being said, the Concert in Central Park still doesn't get a 5 star rating. Why? Well, because, as great as S&amp;G are -and they are - this album is just a simple concert compilation of songs that you can get on any one of their other albums.  I don't particularly thing that the songs they did here are any better or worse than the studio albums, although it is interesting to hear the differences they put into the concert.<br />I also think that the voice tracks between songs actually worked better in concert (i.e. video) better than they do on the CD.<br />This is a wonderful CD to introduce someone to S&amp;G as was done to me so many years ago. However, if you have these songs already, this CD may not really add value to your collection.  On the other hand, if you're an S&amp;G FAN and want everything they ever did, this CD does stand on its own.
B000056N8X|3.0|I have only seen the films and wanted to have some closure, however not having seen the TV series would I be left guessing as to what has been happening in TV land. Having seen the other reviews which really didn't help I bought it anyway.<br />Basically the answer is yes I understood it, it gives a degree of closure to the series and yet leaves enough room for a future film / series, more importantly did I enjoy it. Yes if you take the series as Highlander 1,2 (renegade version) and Endgame you would have a decent trilogy, if you realy wanted to include highlander 3 I feel you would ruin a good series.<br />Good set of extras on this DVD, lots of trailers.<br />yeh ! 3 stars 3.5 if I could<br />Not a great DVD but cerainly not a bad one certainly worth the $15
B00003CX5P|5.0|Many people hated this prequel. I can understand why they would. After all, when something like Star Wars has an almost religious following anything less than a religious experience would be disappointing. What these disappointed people should do, however, is watch the original trilogy and see how many goofy and annoying things they can find in it... seriously. Everybody hails the original Star Wars as a godsend but let's face it, Princess Leia was a whiny brat, Mark Hamille couldn't act his way out of a paper bag, and the lightsaber duel between Vader and Obi-Wan was far from exciting. Even the dialogue was less than great; &quot;But I was gonna go to town to get some power converters!!!&quot; &lt;&lt;whine&gt;&gt;. Or how about the fact that Luke finds his aunt and uncle (the people who raised him) both charred to a crisp and then basically goes; &quot;Oh well... I guess I'll be going to Mos Eisley with you after all...&quot; But God forbid should anyone find fault with the original, because after 20 years it has become like the Bible of sci-fi, because that is the way as children we REMEMBER it. As children, we could care less about acting, special effects or dialogue. What really mattered is all the cool stuff... how Star Wars made us feel... that we had been transported to another WORLD full of new creatures and technology, a world so remarkably detailed and complex that it seemed real. NOBODY but Lucas has EVER been able to create that feeling of otherworldliness. Every sci-fi movie since seems to me like a director/producer just trying to make a little world for a little 2-hour film, but Star Wars is much more, it gives us a glimpse, a magic window into a very real, living world that you can believe continues to thrive long after your window has closed and the credits roll. With the beautiful landscapes of Naboo, Coruscant and Tatooine, with the miasma of aliens and vehicles, who needs to see more? If you want good acting, watch the Godfather... or better yet, watch CNN and stay in good ol' boring (but realistic) Earth.
B00003CXP1|5.0|!WOW! i just rented this movie about a week ago and was shocked, if any of you have seen pi (by the same director) and liked pi than you will just love this movie. I don't know what else to say about this movie except that it is the best movie you will ever see. !trust me!
0385501560|4.0|&quot;Entertaining&quot; isn't the right word, but it's the first word that comes to mind.<br />Although I thought Fight Club, the novel, was much more edgy, entertaining, and compelling, I still believe Choke is worth reading especially for ANY fan of Palahniuk's style.<br />Chuck Palahniuk has a style that captivated many through his novel Fight Club.  Choke, like Fight Club, deals with the problems of one man.  The story is told from his point of view so you get his opinion on everything.  Choke, however, is less about physical and mental destruction and more about one mans semi-fight to stay sober as he is a sexaholic.  <br />Victor Mancini, the sexaholic, attempts to attend numerous meetings with others that have the same affliction, but he fails as he is usually side tracked in some closet with a female sexaholic.  When Victor isn't working at the Colonial Historical Park he uses his spare time to &quot;earn&quot; money in a very unique way.  Victor must use this money to pay for his mothers $3000 a month hospital bill as she is somewhat sick and confused.<br />Many twists and turns makes this a good fiction read for most who are looking for something different.  On the other hand, Choke is a must for fans of Palahniuk's special style.  I'm definitely looking forward to his next novel. <br />Oh yeah, and about Victor being the next coming of the Messiah...
B00005ALNI|5.0|&quot;The Big Chill&quot; put together a terrific cast, including Glen Close, Jeff Goldblume, Kevin Kline and William Hurt about this story of college friends reuniting after the death of one of their classmates.  (The dead friend that you see at the beginning is Kevin Costner, though you never actually see more than his wrists).  This movie is a picture all about friendship-the hilarious, tangled, difficult and uplifting ups and downs that we all go through with our friends.  The movie is filled with wonderful motown hits that will immediately want to make you buy the soundtrack too.  Pop the popcorn and sit back and enjoy!
6301934229|5.0|If u want a non stop action packed movie with an interesting story, then u should consider sparing 100 minutes of your time to view this movie. Some viewers however might lose interest in the movie seeemingly quickly if they like movies which they can relate to at all times and seem to have a good grasp of reality.
6305696071|1.0|I learned so much from 'Pretty Woman'.  Previously I considered prostitution to be a symptom of many of the ills in society, like loneliness, emotional neglect, addiction, inequalities in wealth and access to education, but now I know that prostitution can be fun - in this movie it's fun for the prostitute and it's fun for the client.  Also, in the past, I suspected that there was more to life than money and good looks, but 'Pretty Woman' set me straight on that one: boy, was I wrong!  Money is the most important thing in the world.  It even makes love possible.  Having been taught so many important lessons about life, I think it only fair that we, the viewing public, reward the producers and stars of this film with many millions of dollars - it might even be fair to call them prostitutes too, and to consider ourselves, the audience, as their clients.
0517053616|5.0|This by far is one of the best books I bought. It has most of Shakespears works printed in a split page bible style. I recommend this book highly and I also recommed A Shakespear Glossary to go with it.
B00004Z311|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this movie!  I catch it as many times as I can (when shown on TV)  We don't have a VCR anymore - so no good just buying the tape.<br />Can't wait until the uncut version gets produced-as I already appreciate it in the version I've seen.  Feel sorry for the people who pick this movie apart....It's old, and it's fantasy - I mean, who cares?
078324228X|5.0|Good acting, montage, photography, directing, screening, dialouge and execution. Average special effects. I recommend viewing this movie if u r a kind of person that accepts the recommendation of others towards suggesting movies to watch.
B00003CXRP|5.0|If you were expecting another Robinson Crusoe then this movie is not for you. This movie deals with the human aspect of being removed from everything you know and having to deal with not having the familiar around to keep you comfortable. If you are looking for exciting fights with the natives and constructing amazing devices from coconut shells and bamboo then you may want to go watch Robinson Crusoe or Gilligans Island. This was, I believe, probably a very difficult movie to make and probably even harder to sell the idea to a studio. Like I said earlier this is not Robinson Crusoe and you aren't given a lot of action to watch but what you are given is a look at just how man deals with what he's dealt. How many times have you found yourself having a conversation with ,well yourself, when no one else is around? Now take away all that you have and all your family and friends and, for that matter everything you have, how would you deal with it? A volleyball might just become a good friend. I don't think this movie would ever have seen the light of day if it hadn't been brought forward by such box office powerhouses as Hanks and Zemeckis and I don't know anyone else who could have pulled it off better than Hanks. So I recommend that you watch this movie but don't watch it for a survivalist action adventure flick watch it for what it is, a statement on the human condition and just how one man copes with what life throws his way.
076790382X|5.0|Being Dutch, but having lived in the States and now in Scotland, I really enjoyed this book. Probably because I have seen both sides of the ocean, I can fully understand what he is talking about. Although it looks he is complaining, he basically puts up a mirror in front of you. If you are honest, the things he is writing about makes you to like the States.
B000002JS6|4.0|I purchased this album after seeing VH1's greatest albums of all time list.  Overall, I am pleased with the quality of the music.  Although most of the tunes sound the same, the album is a true classic of hard rock none the less.  However, because of this albums status as a classic, I thought it would have nice liner notes, providing information about the band. Instead I found 5 pictures and a list of the tracks. Disappointing.
B00004KD1L|5.0|For anyone who is planning on buying this album for the track &quot;I see you baby&quot;, stop right there.  If you are looking for crap you have come to the wrong place.  Despite one well intentioned discripancy this is one of the best albums every made.  Tracks like Dusk You &amp; Me, and At The River transport you to beautiful, dreamy soundscapes while the trip-hop sounds of Whatever, Whenever are thrown in to mix things up.  I bought this album on a whim having never knowingly heard Groove Armada. The album gathtered dust for a brief time until I gave it a true listen and realized the gem I possesed.  Groove Armada deserves every accolade they receive and the only time Vertigo leaves my sound systems is to be replaced with their first album, Northern Star.  Kudos to Groove Armada!
B000002H33|5.0|Since this album has been out for 15 years now, I doubt I can say too many good things about it that haven't been said already.  But I might as well add my name to the chorus praising this albums crunching riffs, intelligent lyrics, and ominous-sounding vocals.  My personal faves are the lightning-fast &quot;Battery&quot; (an even better version of which can be found on &quot;S &amp; M&quot;) and the slower, but still plenty dark and heavy &quot;Welcome Home.&quot;  Like all of Metallica's '80's albums, an essential work of thrash.

Then continuing with his sons,etc. Please,can someone do this.If a dvd of this caliber is finally produced,I would be first in line to purchase it...cost ?..no object!Also please add the scenes that were&quot; thrown on the floor...&quot;.             thanks for letting me air my opinion.

B00005BJC7|5.0|Another great album by my local god and the guys.It is more like a dream session for me.it starts with this weird-beautiful song &quot;packed like...&quot; and ends with the surprising&amp;great&amp;perfect  &quot;life in a glass house&quot; ..43 minutes of travelling in some dark blue water,with God's voice as ur guide. The album is just perfect,in fact I can't get it out of my cd player for a second.... I adore this band and anything comes from them is holy. God(Thom)loves his children.
B0000214F0|3.0|The unrated version is great. Beautiful Penthoue-bunnies, lot of ... and terror, a vulgar movie for men only :-) The picture quality is moderate, like a good quality VHS tape. Unfortunately, there is only English sound in low quality and no text.  The only extra is the \\"making of\\". Te disc has no regional coding.
0780622642|3.0|When I was a kid I used to thrill to the adventures of the LOST IN SPACE TV series each week.  As I got older though, and watched the reruns, I noticed how campy this TV series was.<br />I was pleasantly surprised to see this video.  Unlike many of the  movie re-makes of old TV series, this is loads of fun and enjoyable. The special effects are great and supplement the plot nicely.  Gary Oldman comes off as a particularly nasty Dr. Smith; while John Hurt is a flawed, but valiant John Robinson; and Mimi Rogers is a much tougher Mrs. Robinson than June Lockhart ever was.  The plot is  drawn from the earlier series but with some interesting twists.  Given its a movie of a TV series you have to wonder exactly how they are going to end it.  Its not campy like the TV series.  <br />Pleasant, fun-filled television for the whole family.

B000002P5R|4.0|Last time I reviewed a Hendrix release I didn't get a lot of &quot;helpfuls.&quot;  And that was a favorable (though qualified) review.  See, I don't think Hendrix was God or anything.  But, sonically, he could be pretty damn amazing.  (I think where I part company with the real hard-core Hendrix-philes is that I find his lyrics often awkward at best).<br />&quot;First Rays of the Rising Sun&quot; is a sort-of best of the posthumous releases compilation.  And it really does succeed well on that level.  Who can deny that an album with such masterpieces as &quot;Night Bird Flying,&quot; &quot;Angel,&quot;  and &quot;Room Full of Mirrors&quot; isn't a must for any fan.  Can it really matter whether this &quot;estate authorized&quot; version of his final release OR some other version (I don't know &quot;Voodoo Soup,&quot; though I'm sure the comparison would be, at least, interesting) is superior?  Ultimately no compilation of tracks that the artist himself considered &quot;unfinished&quot; is going to be perfect.  But this one has lots and lots of great moments and only serves to remind the listener of what could have been if Hendrix had lived.<br />By the way, the editorial comments above suggest that an older, wiser Hendrix might have been a lot less fun.  Maybe, but this record has my alltime favorite Hendrix &quot;fun&quot; song too.  &quot;Dolly Dagger&quot; mines the same load as &quot;Foxey Lady&quot; and &quot;Purple Haze,&quot; but is even wittier and has just the right bounce.  The Ghetto Fighters harmonies are a nice touch too (always nice to have real singers around even when the emphasis is justly on that amazing guitar work).  <br />Bottom line: obligatory for most fans.  Beginners would do well to start off with &quot;Are You Experienced?&quot; or &quot;Electric Ladyland&quot; however.
B00004ZD69|4.0|This CD contains 2 discs, each with 2 songs timing in around 20 minutes.  Each of the songs contain about 7-12 minutes of excellent 5 star music.  Each contain about 1-4 minutes of OK 3 star music.  Some parts of the album go for about 4 or 5 where you can't even here anything.  One song rattles on and on about Coney Island.  Some of it, is just a noise.  Get rid of the silence and the just a noise, this would be a 5 star review.  Some say that the silence is necessary...if I wanted silence I wouldn't turned my stereo on in the first place.
B000050FEN|5.0|When i bought this movie I had'nt seen it but was convinced that it was good atleast. So I picked this up at a DVD store, got home and popped it in the player and watched it. When i had seen it I was convinced that this was a GREAT movie! This movie has got to be the best impulse buy I've did since Sleepy Hollow, maybe even The Abyss: Special Edition! Also, the DVD is on of the best DVD's ever! The video transfer is beautiful and crisp and i have'nt seen a single flaw yet. I have'nt had a chance to test sound fully yet (lack of surround sound system!), but that i can hear is great. The extras are good and intresting (4 audio commentary tracks!) and really makes the DVD even more worth buying. The only gripe i have about this movie is that it's not for everyone, but it was'nt as gory as i thought. Higly recommended, buy this NOW, you wo'nt regret it. Aleast I have'nt.
B000001Y42|5.0|This is the first and best album from Limp Bizkit. It serves as much melody, rap and rock as every other album. I just can't stop liking it, it rocks. Everybody should have this cd. My favourites are Indigo Flow and Stink Finger. Just get it.
0446677450|4.0|I found this book to be a great motivational teaching, a good kick-in-the-pants for those who are comfortable with their 9 to 5 jobs. Like others have said, there are probably a few embellishments to the story, but the premise of what he is saying is solid.<br />What kept me from giving this book 5 stars is that it is flawed in some of the business concepts that it teaches. Kiyosaki does not have a business degree, and it shows. For example, he defines &quot;assets&quot; as &quot;anything you own that generates income.&quot; That's not too bad, but a standard accounting definition would be &quot;anything you own that has financial value&quot;. Conversely he defines liabilities as &quot;anything you own that isn't generating money;&quot; again, the concept of assets and liabilities in financial accounting does not consider income, which is totally different. Considering that the point of the book is for you to go out and make an impact in the business world, it might be important for you to have the terminology right when you talk to people. He also regards &quot;corporations&quot; as tax shelters; that's not quite right, either. Corporations get taxed, too, and you are taxed again on any money you take out of the corporation. Supposedly, his co-author, Sharon Lechter, is a CPA, so it's difficult to understand how such glaring errors could have made it into the book.<br />Like any other motivational book, read it with a grain of salt, absorb it, take what you can use and discard the rest. If you are looking for a book to get you motivated about investing and wealth-building, then I think that this is a good one to have.
B00005B4GU|5.0|though admittedly, radiohead at their worst is still better than most bands. i've read a lot of just plain wrong things about this album (see Entertaiment Weekly), but the worst has to go to the guy a few reviews down comparing Pyramid Song to Ben Folds Five (just because piano features prominently? that's absurd) This is a tuneful album, never boring and often captivating. It doesn't flow like Kid A, it seems more to be a collection of unrelated songs. Amnesiac is a slightly brighter, more accessible album than Kid A and is not, as many would-be clever people have said, &quot;Kid B&quot;, an album of Kid A leftovers.
B000002LR3|5.0|Everyone gives this album 5 stars and they'll tell why this album is good.  Top 10...If you have said this, do not buy this album: 10.  &quot;I really enjoy listening to Journey albums.&quot; 9.  &quot;Van Halen's For Unlawful Carnal Knowlege is the best album of the 90's.&quot; 8.  &quot;When I get home I like to turn on the TV and watch the Beverly Hillbillies.&quot; 7.  &quot;Today's music ain't got the same soul, I like that old time uh rock and roll.&quot; 6.  &quot;The only 'new band' I like is Aerosmith.&quot;<br />5.  &quot;I really miss big hair bands.&quot; 4.  &quot;In 1992 I was jamming to the cool original riff of Ice Ice Baby.&quot; 3.  &quot;Who sings Stairway to Heaven?&quot; 2.  &quot;Call the radio station, they are giving away tickets to go  see Lynyrd Skynyrd.&quot; 1.  &quot;When Sceamdelica came out I didn't want to hear tracks like 'Loaded', 'Come Together', or 'Damaged' because I was jamming to real cult heroes and future Hall of Famers The Velvet Underground!

B000003TA4|5.0|To respond to riversideknight...  If you had listened to this CD back in late 1991 as I did before it was well known, you would have done what I did then... caught your breath when you could and realized that you just heard something bigger and better than anything that had come before it.   I didn't know then that Kurt would forever change what we believed in, but after one listen, I had my suspicions...  Nirvana killed Poison, Warrant, Motley Crue and all the other hair bands (thankfully), even as they ultimately brought upon themselves (Kurt) their own destruction.  To Kurt and the band, we say thank you, we couldn't have gotten here without you. So..to every person under 30..  guild this thing, frame it, put it on an altar... but never forget that you and the music you listen to (with the exception of Brittney and N'whatever and the like) is the anti-thesis, the answer to, and the reward for everything we put up with B.K. (before Kurt). Thus ends my eulogy.

006092988X|5.0|I have read many classic books, but \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" is by far the best work of literature I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing.   As a sixteen year old young woman from suburban America, many may question how I can possibly relate to the unfortunate life led by Francie Nolan.  However, this is the beauty of Betty Smith's masterpiece, for EVERY young woman is capable of relating to many of the scenes found in this timeless classic.  These include Francie's sexual assault, the favoritism Francie's mother has for brother Neeley, and the close relationship Fancie has with her father, whose alcoholism ultimately leads to his untimely death.  <br />Despite the hardships Francie is faced with, she perseveres, acquiring a job in order to help her family survive.  Although her education must be put on hold for the time being, Francie remains hopeful that the day will come in which she, like her brother, Neeley, will be capable of going off to school. <br />Not only is the ongoing story of a young girl growing up in Brooklyn simply timeless, but the metaphor of the tree outside Francie's window that has grown through unfortunate circumstances is absolutely perfect.  The tree had been cut down and was even the victim of a bonfire, but it continued to grow and blossom.  Just like Francie, the tree beat the odds and rose from nothingness to beauty and strength.<br />Never have I read anything and cried at the end simply because it was over.  As you read \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\", you become wrapped up in Francie's life until you feel as though she and you are one in the same.  The fact that I have only read this book once astonishes me, and I can guarantee you that I will read it again this summer.  The purchase of this book may set you [a few]...dollars, but the experience of reading \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" is absolutely priceless.
0691023565|5.0|You know? I was looking for the book for 6 months. It's a very old book(Second Edition 1956). I guess no one in Bangladesh have the book. Not in any University Library or in general. No way to be found in New Market. I asked some one will visit Calcutta, India. He was my teacher. He failed to bring it for me.<br />At last, one of my friends at Toronto order the book for me, she got after 15 days and send it to me after 30 days through one of her relative.<br />I felt I must read it. After having and reading, I found that the book is really a very basic book to open your mind for facing problems. Which helps to understand, think, analyze and solve problems. I'm a programmer in C. I love to think about problem.
B000002H33|5.0|In 1986, Metallica were not well-known yet, except for mainly diehard heavy metal fans. Although this album did not have any hit singles that made MTV (they were way too cool for that at this point), it earned them some recognition among the average citizen. This eight-song album shows just what can happen when Hetfield, Hammett, Ulrich, and Burton combine (and by the way, all of these are in my top 3 or 4 of their respective position in this genre.) It is sad that Cliff Burton died while on tour for this album. It challenged Metallica, but they showed that they could still make great music. And, besides, they had nothing left to prove. Not after this masterpiece. Though not at their lyrical peak yet (that would happen on And Justice For All), they had still had great lyrics, and everything was working on full cylinders. <br />What I find ironic is that what Metallica was intending to do on this album was done much better on &quot;And Justice For All&quot;. They wanted to get much more into complex strong structures, and although they certainly do that here with some songs, it is consistent from track-to-track on &quot;And Justice&quot;. Moreover, this concept seems to especially lose steam on the second half of the album, where they opt for faster and quicker songs. However, their intent resulted in metal perfection, while &quot;And Justice For All&quot; was underdone in terms of production and overdone in terms of musical complexity.<br />&quot;Battery&quot; opens the album, and while it starts with a not-very-original acoustic intro, it quickly works its way into an all-out pounder of a track that clocks in as the quickest on the album, even with the acoustic intro. However, what is to follow is the true gem of this album: The title track. An 8 1/2-minute masterpiece, this track starts out as a genuine hard rocking song. However, at around 3:30 in the song, Metallica get tired of this. So all of a sudden, the song goes quiet and then builds its way back up to where it started. Then comes one of the best solos of Kirk Hammett's career, and then back into the song. This is easily the best on the album. However, the two tracks that follow this one, &quot;The Thing That Should Not Be&quot; and &quot;Welcome Home (Sanitarium)&quot; are in a close race for second. The former has a very catchy, though simplistic, guitar riff and very cryptic and interesting lyrics. The latter is the slow ballad on the album (like track 4 usually is on early Metallica albums), and it makes you wonder what was going through James Hetfield's mind to write these lyrics. The whole concept is horribly brilliant, yet I will spare you in case you have just eaten lunch. Then comes the other 8-minute song, &quot;Disposable Heroes.&quot; This song has great lyrics, but is a little overlong considering it sticks to the same concept throughout the song. I probably rate it the weakest on the album, but it's still far from skipworthy. The last three songs on the album are &quot;Leper Messiah&quot;, &quot;Orion&quot; and &quot;Damage Inc.&quot; A beautiful instrumental with all four members of the band (well, except the singer, obviously) having great solos, &quot;Orion&quot; sandwiches two of the angrier songs on the album, &quot;Leper Messiah&quot; and &quot;Damage Inc.&quot; Both of these clock in at under six minutes (this is what I was referring to as destroying the concept), but are still heavy metal masterpieces, although &quot;Leper Messiah&quot; seems too dependent on the heavy-metal concepts of the time. (The world was just being introduced to hair-metal, which occasionally had some sacreligious aspects to it.) <br />Overall, I rate this an astounding album, that is certainly one of the best Metallica has ever done, and a landmark in heavy metal history. If you have an early Metallica album and liked it: run, don't walk, to the CD store to get this one. If you have a late Metallica album and liked it, yet are only used to the Metallica that sings &quot;Fuel&quot; and &quot;Enter Sandman&quot;, get this but be warned that the songs are much longer and the music is somewhat heavier than you are used to. If you do not have any Metallica albums yet, start with this one unless you are pretty sure that Metallica is the heaviest band you have tried. In that case, try &quot;The Black Album&quot; first. No metalhead's collection is complete without this.

B000002BPS|5.0|I have heard every single one of their CDs. The Offspring, Ignition, Smash, Ixnay on the Hombre, Americana, and Conspiracy of One and I know which ones are the best. If you want your cheesy-now-a-days &quot;punk&quot;, then you should listen to the most famous of the 6... Of course Americana and Conspiracy of One... Who doesn't know those? But if you like music that really gets to you, that makes you want to scream, or cry, or just sit down and stare into space, or make you so you can't move even if you wanted to... Ignition, Smash, and Ixnay on the Hombre or the best. From &quot;The Meaning Of Life&quot; right down to &quot;Save The World&quot;, you won't be disappointed. I got the CD just because of one song, &quot;Gone Away&quot;. The first time i heard this I cried. This song really gets to you. You know that when they wrote this song they really felt the loss that is shown in this song. Or &quot;Meaning of Life&quot; this song shows how controlling the world can be. &quot;Me and My Old Lady&quot; and &quot;Cool to Hate&quot; just show what they think about anything and everything. &quot;Leave It Behind&quot; just a very powerful and great song. I bought this CD for just one song and when I got home and listened to it, never once did it come to my mind that this was anything other then one of the worlds greatest CDs. I totally think you should go out and buy it... Before you're to old to understand it.
B000002H97|4.0|This is an album often hated by many early Metallica fans. Even though they like it somewhat because it still has that early edge, they dislike it because it was the start of what they refer to as a sellout when Metallica attempted to go mainstream. True, there are three Top 40 rock hits off this album, and six songs that are now considered classics by many different types of rock fans. And, yes, the songs are shorter. Much shorter. (My Friend of Misery is the longest, clocking in at 6:49). However, this is one of a quintet of highly successful rock albums released in 1991, which really was a great year for music. And it still holds the title of being the heaviest of those five, mainly because two of those five were breakthrough albums for major grunge groups. James Hetfield's voice has not lost its edge, Kirk Hammett can still play the guitar, Jason Newsted is learning the ropes at bass, and Lars Ulrich's drums are still top-notch. It's just that now everyone knows about it. Is that a bad thing?<br />The album starts off with &quot;Enter Sandman,&quot; which is the best by far that you will find on their latest three full-length &quot;regular&quot; studio releases. The better half of the songs on this 12-track album (the six hits) are &quot;Enter Sandman,&quot; &quot;Sad But True&quot;, &quot;The Unforgiven&quot;, &quot;Wherever I May Roam&quot;, &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot; and &quot;Of Wolf and Man&quot;, in order of how they appear on the album. These six songs are certainly better than the other six. &quot;Sad But True&quot; has lyrics that I don't really like that much, but it still has killer riffs; &quot;The Unforgiven&quot; is strong enough that I can see why they created a Part 2 to this song, &quot;Wherever I May Roam&quot; is a solid rock composition, and &quot;Of Wolf And Man&quot; has a great ending that makes it perfect for playing live. The only one of these six that are considered &quot;the better half&quot; that I dislike is &quot;Nothing ElseMatters.&quot; This is a quiet Metallica song that...stays reasonably quiet, unlike anything they've ever done before; a little bit of a cheesy ballad if you will. While I can understand why this track was created, it just isn't up my alley.<br />Of the weaker half of the album, there are still some especially solid songs. See in particular &quot;My Friend of Misery&quot;. The lyrics seemed to take a slight step back this album; unfortunately it is a pitfall that they have, as yet, been unable to recover from. This album created &quot;Load&quot; and &quot;Reload,&quot; you will see a much more detailed explanation when I review &quot;Load&quot;, as I dislike people who can't see why &quot;Load&quot; and &quot;Reload&quot; were in demand at the time they created them.<br />Overall, if you are new to Metallica, start with &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; (if you're new to Metallica but not new with metal) or this (if you're new with metal.) Probably their 3rd best album, again it's really close between &quot;Ride The Lightning&quot; and this. A solid work that showed Metallica were ready to appeal to the masses.

B00003CXRP|5.0|I give this movie 5 stars because of Tom Hanks, his performance was extraoridinary. The movie and plot are good (4 stars) with pretty deep meanings that really touched me at the time because of a situation I was going through. Some people call this movie boring, well I call them shallow. This movie is deep, moving, and touching. It is by no means exciting except for the plane crash. If you want to see what should have been an oscar winning performance then you should watch this film. The majority of this movie is shot on the beach with only 1 actor and you are still enthralled. Enjoy it, I know I did.

B000050IMJ|4.0|Very good car flick except for the Mustang (would have been more interesting with a COPO Camaro). Nickolas Cage proves that love for a brother is much more important than mere money. Angelina Jolie gets very jiggy with it too. <br />That Mustang gets pretty roughed up in this flick.<br />In the end Nick Cage gets the keys to the Mustang. Too bad it won't start.
B000002H6C|4.0|All things considered, it would have been very tough for any album following &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; to receive 5 stars. The expectations set by that album of greatness would be too tough to live up to. This was made even harder when Cliff Burton, Metallica's expert bassist, died while on tour for the &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; album. His replacement was Jason Newsted, another excellent bassist, but struggling to live up to Burton's lofty standards. Still, that is no excuse for the production to be so murky. The production cuts down on bass, as you might expect, but it cuts down so heavily that you begin to wonder if it's a three-man band. Compared to the glittering &quot;Master of Puppets,&quot; this is very shoddily done production-wise. However, this does not detract too much from the way the songs were written. After all, this is Metallica, people. There are no secrets behind those guitar chords, this is just great, loud music, and it isn't meant to be anything else. <br />That being said, I will say I still took a star off for the production quality, which added a bit of the sameness to the songs. On Metallica's &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;, every song had its own way that it stood out and made you listen, particularly on Side 1, probably the best album side in the history of heavy metal, short of maybe Side 1 on &quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot;. On &quot;And Justice&quot;, there are only three songs that truly stand out from the murky pitfall of the production, and the reason one of them does is was because it was an instrumental that was the last track Metallica did with Cliff Burton. However, Metallica seemingly makes up for it. They were easily at their lyrical peak on this album; this was their most political period. The lyrics are not only strong, they are now powerful, and they had, by this time, learned how to make the music fit the lyrics. James Hetfield is also in prime form on this album, maybe even better than on &quot;Master of Puppets.&quot;<br />&quot;Blackened&quot;, &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot;, &quot;Harvester of Sorrow&quot;, &quot;The Shortest Straws&quot;, &quot;The Frayed Ends of Sanity&quot; and &quot;Dyers Eve&quot; are all great songs. While &quot;The Frayed Ends of Sanity&quot; is one of the best song titles of all time, the song fails to deliver. These songs just fall too much into the mold of everything else. Metallica tried too hard to extend their songs on this album, and as a result, with only nine concepts expressed in sixty-five minutes, you can end up repeating yourself a lot. However, now let's get to those three other ones.<br />&quot;To Live Is To Die&quot; is an instrumental that was the last song Metallica ever did with Cliff Burton. It has a great song title, and it is a pretty good song although I was surprised the production quality was not improved too much for this one. It is overlong though, as it is near ten minutes---it's not good when the longest song on your album is an instrumental. It is only one second longer than the title track. I love the fade-out.<br />However, now we get to the two gems. These two songs could easily earn this album three stars if all Metallica played was polka music for the rest of the album. They are track 2, &quot;And Justice For All&quot;, and track 4 &quot;One.&quot; The former is Metallica's 2nd best ever idea of how to make an epic (falling just short of &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;), and the latter is THE best song Metallica has ever done, barely beating out &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;. &quot;One&quot; is track 4 on this album, meaning that it is again the slow ballad, but it doesn't stay that way. There are, count 'em, THREE, great guitar solos in this song about a soldier who has had everything taken away from him because of the war. At around 4:30 or so, the way the song effortlessly moves from a gripping ballad into a thrilling headbanger is nothing short of breathtaking. This was the song that finally got Metallica to do a music video, and it may have caused &quot;The Black Album,&quot; which, though different, isn't necessarily a bad thing. I could easily program my CD player to put those two tracks on repeat for hours and not get bored. They feature the best guitar solos and guitar concepts that Metallica has ever dreamed of.<br />If you are new to Metallica, I do not recommend starting with this at all, instead try &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; or &quot;The Black Album.&quot; If you love Master of Puppets and the song concepts to death, get this. If you, however, love it only for the music and wish the songs were shorter, go back to earlier in their career. And if &quot;The Black Album&quot; is too heavy for you, forget this. While certainly not the highest point of Metallica's career, it's worth buying just for &quot;And Justice For All&quot; and &quot;One&quot; alone.
B00004XOWM|4.0|It don't matter what you think they're still the best. They won't stop making excellent records, and C.S.A.T.H.D.F.W isn't an exception. One of their best sides are their lyrics, when Fred Durst raps with his high monkey-voice those magical words you can't go back. Just buy it, ok?
B00004YKUY|5.0|I saw Journey last year on tour and was completely impressed with the new lead singer.  I was however, doubting that he could produce a CD with the rest of the band that would keep Journey on top of my favs.  I was completely wrong!  Journey has written and produced an excellent CD!  this is a must!  I just hope this new band Motorplant can find as much success as Journey has over the years.  Check out their new CD &quot;American Postcard&quot;
B000059XYM|3.0|I've been avoiding reviewing this video because the dialog is sort of crude. To be more specific (bleep this out if you want) when that girl says \\"oops I farted\\" I became nauseated. Not my kind of flick I lost interest about half-way through and turned it off.<br />That phoney ghost just makes me want to puke.
0393314804|5.0|What an abosolute delight from Welsh. I think the movie didn't do it justice at all. Trainspotting had a distinct vibe throughout the whole book. It had a sense of anarchy, distortion, and a little bit of righteous sense. The characters had excellent personalities and attributes. All of them were diverse in their own way, but most of them shared something in common, skag(heroin). It's quite a shame that I saw the movie before I read the book. I think the movie simply just summarized the book in a short method and changed some scenarios. Also, it took me about an hour just to get used to the dialog but that's just another reason why the book is outstanding. Welsh actually wrote it from a prospective of a person. Trainspotting is now one of my favorite books. I recommend this to everyone or to the ones that want to read about reality through the point of view of an addict.
B00003CXN4|2.0|Anytime a movie gathers so many positive reviews, I feel obliged to listen to them and see what the movie is about - after all, the critics are likely to credit those movies that pay attention to character development and credibility and pay less attention to plot developments. Unfortunately, I still have hard time determining just what this particular movie has achieved, what original characters it has generated and passed on to directors and screen writers of the future, for them to admire. I can safely say that more than 100s of movies about drugs (good and bad) have been made in the past and that &quot;Traffic&quot; recycles ideas from them all; as hard as I searched, I could not find any original ones. With the exception of Benicio Del Toro, none of the characters were sufficient to redeem the movie - rich kids for whom we are supposed to feel sorry and who blame their parents for not listening to them, politicians and the nouveau riche drug dealers (even the various American anti-drug organizations are represented) fill the rest of the plot (I understand that all these people have been integrated to compare various aspects of the war on drugs, but anyone who has read a book by Clancy or seen various FOX series of the 80th will be privy to little new; so I wonder what new angle this movie has presented and why we have to pay attention for 2 1/2 hours) and we are supposed to feel/know their pain. I am not even sure I find the character development believable or reasonable. E.g., Catherine Zeta-Jones' character undergoes amazing transformations into a opportunistic killer - and we are expected to understand her pain or blame the drug world or suffer the harsh reality of her actions and just understand how cruel the world may become - but I must ask why is such a character even interesting and whether some individual sacrifice (like walking away on her husband) would not be more realistic and worth some admiration. In any case, I am most disappointed by the critics when it comes to this movie. It seems that they have all jumped on the &quot;PC&quot; bandwagon so to speak (I know I am going a bit too far with this observation but oh well), just to make sure that they have not written wrong reviews that would be inconsistent with their colleagues. Having seen the movie, I have found nothing rewarding in the experience. I am still a little baffled why the movie won Oscar for best editing.
B00004XQ83|5.0|I hate modern country.  I can't stand the whiny, complaining, nasally lyrics that accompany the twangy music.  The songs on this soundtrack are nowhere near today's country.  They far surpass anything that'd be played at Grand Ol' Opry or on CMT.  The songs are rhythmic, spiritual, and uplifting.  On &quot;Po' Lazarus&quot;, everytime the axes are dropped, I get shivers.  (That's a lot of shivers).  On &quot;Down In the River To Pray&quot;, it makes me almost start crying.  The vocals are so unbelievable and the harmonization is perfect.  Each of the four versions of &quot;I am a Man of Constant Sorrow&quot; are beautifully and uniquely performed.  Every song is fantastic and this CD is well worth your money.  By the way, I usually listen to disco, classic rock, and old school R &amp; B.  This is certainly a change, but I love it.
B000002IZM|5.0|Until I became aware of \\"Vangelis\\" I had always thought \\"Tangerine Dream\\" had done the Blade Runner soundtrack. That music at the end while the credits are running is so very hopeful. The end of the flick is really a beginning and Vangelis really sums it up with this track.<br><br>Rachel is a replicant, yes, but without the four-year built-in expiration. Philip K.

014028009X|3.0|This is a very funny novel.  The story of Bridget and her friends brings back some memories of being single, but her adventures are pretty extreme.  Her liquor salesman must be quite wealthy, I'm amazed at her alcohol consumption(and went to a college with a well known rep as a party school).<br />Bridget's take on being a singleton is not to be missed, enjoy.
B00001NFCY|2.0|First of all I am not a Creed hater but a music fan, I listened to there cd and felt it was very inspiring and obvious that he was influenced from a higher calling. I think the music is un-original, you cant honestly say that after listening to the cd that you have not heard that type of music voice. I suppose the only thing i did like about it was that it was positive and easy to listen to without the annoying explitives in the music because that tends to get old. Im sure after listening to the cd you can comprise a list of music bands that make Creed out to be a carbon copy of those bands (ie: Pearl Jam, STP, etc.)
B00005B4GU|3.0|Following the intrepid but rewarding experimentation of the brilliant Kid A is Amnesiac, an album with the same rudimentary personality. The tracks that constitute Amnesiac were recorded during the Kid A session, and as a result of this, they share a sense of uneasy solidarity. I say uneasy because throughout Amnesiac, I felt obliged to make comparisons with Radiohead's previous album, and the indisputable fact is that Amnesiac feels like the less talented brother of Kid A. <br />Amnesiac also marks the return of guitars, but they are not used as effectively as they were in The Bends or OK Computer. The underlying sentiment throughout listening is one of disappointment. Amnesiac fails to attain the stupefying heights of OK Computer and falls short of matching Kid A's subtle, melancholy and captivating audio panorama. Instead, it is an inferior halfway house between the two giants.<br />I originally considered it generous of Radiohead to release two albums within eight months of each other, but after repeated listenings, Amnesiac begins to falter, its foundation losing credibility, until I finally gave way to the notion that Radiohead missed the chance of a lifetime. Rather than separating the products of their Kid A session, the best of the two albums should have been blended into a single, phenomenal masterpiece . However, Radiohead chose not to take this path, and as Amnesiac stands, it looks flustered and broken.<br />This isn't to say that Amnesiac does not contain sparks of ingenuity. The pleasing 'Packt like Sardines in a Crushed Tin' harks back to 'Everthing in its Right Place'. 'Pyramid Song' is a haunting and evocative euphony. 'You and Whose Army' culminates into a stunning climax. 'Knives Out' sounds like something that would have fitted quite snugly into OK Computer. 'Dollars and Cents' is a strangely absorbing reproach aimed at our 21st-century financial idiosyncrasy. 'Life in a Glass House' is an eccentric but likeable combination of Thom Yorke's desperate vocals and the cacophony of a seemingly but not-quite discordant brass section.<br />However, the momentum of Amnesiac is disturbed by difficult tracks such as 'Hunting Bears', 'Spinning Plates' and the uniquely named 'Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors'. They are very obviously of the same breed as tracks from Kid A, but are less proficiently crafted and seem deeper than they actually are. 'Morning Bell/Amnesiac' and 'I Might be Wrong' are both promising tracks that, ultimately, fail to engage the listener. <br />Looking at other customer reviews indicates that the general reception for Amnesiac is a warm one. There is no doubting that Radiohead are one of the most important bands in existence right now, but this does not deter me from concluding that in the end, Amnesiac adds up to a disjointed and distant album that lacks the cohesiveness. There are superb moments in Amnesiac, but there are deficiencies almost in equal parts. This is what makes Amnesiac so bewildering: it is a magnum opus that voluntarily drowns itself, the result being that it emerges embarrassed and dulled.
B000003S5H|5.0|..One of the few PERFECT albums in existence. The first time I heard this CD I was floored. Anybody who can listen to a song like &quot;All I Need&quot; and not be moved must be dead. Truly amazing. This is a &quot;must buy&quot; for any music fan.
B000002IWH|5.0|Undoubtadly one of the best soundtracks of all time, this soundtrack captures the mood and feel of the movie perfectly.  Plus this is the only time you'll ever see and hear The Cure, Stone Temple Pilots, Nine Inch Nails, Rollins Band, Rage Against the Machine, and Pantera on the same album.  A true classic.
B00004XOWM|1.0|Fred durst's voice ruins everything. the sad thing is people actually buy limp stuff to hear him.
0446677450|1.0|If you are looking for specifics on how to make money, you will be disappointed.  This book tells you what to do, rather than how to go about doing it.  Few of us need to be told that in order to become rich, we have to cultivate our `Financial IQ' and invest wisely, etc, etc.  This amounts to plain rhetoric, although the author is without doubt a brilliant marketeer who expertly packaged his otherwise commonsensical ideas and made use of a catchy title.  I find it rather irritating to see the same few ideas being repeated so many times throughout the book, as if the readers are so dumb that they need reinforcements.  I am amazed that such a hollow topic can take up close to 200 pages!  Don't waste your time on this book.  To me, this whole thing is just another fad.
0140131558|4.0|We read this book in our book club, and it received less than stellar response from the other readers, but I have always found Auster a rather idiosyncratic &quot;taste&quot; just the same.  The initial story, my favorite of the three in the trilogy, is &quot;City of Glass,&quot; is a portrayal of an aimless character, who finds himself drawn into a mystery, for which there is little to gain and an obtuse and not particularly linear structure.  The &quot;noir&quot; story structure is used throughout, and though there is certainly mystery of a sort as to how the smaller clues will lead our hero to piece things together, and arrive at the stories conclusion, there is a meditation on language and how ideas are conveyed that is really at the root of the events of the story.
1562020714|5.0|Having been raised on a working ranch located on the Texas/Mexico border, I can say without reservation that the characters in this film are extremely realistic.  The tack, gear, weapons, speech, and mannerisms are all authentic.<br />While the story, plot, drama and light-hearted moments in the film are obviously the big draw, it is important to note that many of the central characters are almagamations of actual people who lived in Texas during the time this story takes place.  There really were renegades here who were every bit as vicious as Blue Duck (or &quot;Mr. Duck&quot; as Gus calls him at one point).  Gus and Call are familiar to me because the men I was raised around were exactly like them.<br />If you want to see a good Western with authentic Texas flavor and a good story, this is the best you'll find.
B00005B4GU|3.0|If you want to have an aproxiamte idea of Radiohead sound, better go to other material. Amnesiac represents a decline in the evolution of Radiohead art. Perhaps Life in a Glasshouse is the sound that every Raidohead fan expects...but, unfortunatelly, it comes until the very end...after you heard a very unusual and nonsense material. Like a fan of Radiohead, I excpected too much more....this record its just a case of Amnesiac....
B00005BJ2O|4.0|I just recently saw the movie, and it was &quot;spectacular, spectaular&quot;.  The songs in the movie were great, so naturally i went to the store to buy the soundtrack.  I was surprised that &quot;Like A Virgin&quot; was not included, as well as the Sound of Music parody (the hills are alive...).  What also struck me as odd was that they included some songs that weren't really in the movie.  The songs from the movie that were included were great though.  So don't get me wrong, I think the soundtrack is very very good, but it cannot be the complete five stars because of what is lacking.  All in all, if you don't mind that some songs are missing, you should definitely go out and buy this soundtrack.  The Elephant Love Medley is the most hilarious batch of songs, and McGregor and Kidman have quite good voices.
B00003CXCS|5.0|I always watch DVD movies through my laptop, enjoying better visual quality than on TV set. When this DVD was loaded and played on my laptop, I couldn't help suspecting that my eyes had something wrong. The video quality was so enhanced that the film looked so dfferent from what I've seen on TV.<br /> So much accustomed to the video qualities of the 1960's movies aired on TV, that I felt a little awkward and uncomfortable with its vivid full-fledged colours, but fortunately, my eyes adapted themselves quickly to its colours, as the film ran on.<br /> With a supplement disc, this DVD version is a &quot;must-have&quot;, if you are real fans of musical movies. To me, this DVD is the first one that is constantly inducing me to buy a DVD player and widescreen TV to enjoy the full benefits from DVD technologies.
B00005B4GU|2.0|I tried to like this album, I really did. I turned off the phone, locked the doors, sank into my listening room chair, killed all the lights, and let her fly. Now, writing this review after 3 complete listenings to the album over a period of a week, I find myself unsatisfied with the release.  I like the &quot;feel&quot; of the album; I like the direction Yorke is trying to take it, but it just gets bogged down by the particulars; too long a track here, too underdeveloped a guitar line, or, more predominantly, too much low bass. Not something I enjoyed listening too; it's always a bad sign when I'm eagerly awaiting the NEXT track, hoping it will be something good. The one stand-out track for me is You and Whose Army, which is powerful and beautiful. It reminds me of Exit Music (for a Film) just a bit (my favorite radiohead track ever).. listen to You and Whose Army, in the dark, at high volume, if you've skimmed over it.
6305308659|5.0|From Writer/Director Gary Ross(Big, Dave) comes the original and breathtaking film &quot;Pleasantville&quot;. The film opens in the America of today, where we are taught that the world is in a down spiral and will only continue to get worse. A teenager named David(Tobey Maguire) is a fanatic of the 50's television show &quot;Pleasantville&quot; and knows everything about it. Meanwhile his twin sister Jennifer(Reese Witherspoon) is a satire of teenage life in herself with her getting ready for her date. They both fight over the television remote and when it breaks, a television repaire man knocks on the door, offering a remote &quot;with more oomph&quot; in it. When they click it, they are magically transported into the world of &quot;Pleasantville&quot;.<br />&quot;Pleasantville&quot; seems to combine the worlds of many 50's television shows, from the twin beds to the lover's lane where nothing goes on besides holding hands. David and Jennifer become Bud and Mary Sue, the children of George and Betty(William H. Macy, Joen Allen). The townspeople have no idea of an outside world. When Jennifer asks what is outside of mainstreet, the teacher answers, &quot;The end of mainstreet is just the beginning again.&quot; Life is absolutely perfect, with the basketball team incapable of missing a shot. When one player Skip discusses his first sexual experience with the team, everyone misses the basket.<br />David can adapt to this world easily because of  his &quot;Pleasantville&quot; knowledge, but Jennifer tries to change everything, and make it her definition of normal. From this black and white world, vibrant colors emerge and changes begin to appear. Rock and roll blares from the jukebox, and the teenagers no longer just hold hands at lover's lane. The kids at school become interested in books, and the library becomes one of the popular hangouts. Bud's employer Mr. Johnson(Jeff Daniels), a soda jerk, becomes involved in art when Bud hands him a book filled with reproducedworks of art. He then goes on to paint his own works of art on the outside of his diner.<br />As the people change from black and white to color, there are still many people left unchanged. This splits the town in the ways that America was divided during the era. The chairman of the chamber of congress (J.T. Walsh) wants to keep things pleasant, so he wants to take out the things that are unpleasant. Violence breaks out, and the people do not realize that they would be in color as well if they expressed their inner feelings. Mary sue questions why she isn't in color and Bud answers: &quot;Maybe it's not just the sex, it's the change&quot;.<br />&quot;Pleasantville&quot; shows how different life was in the 50's, but it is not really as different as you might think. Some of the townspeople accept their new change with happiness while others fear it. They are pleasant but they are not really happy. They are merely settled into there lives with an everyday redundancy. &quot;Pleasantville&quot; is a cinematic masterpiece with incredible acting and a remarkable kindness to it. The film is a suprising joy.

630382790X|5.0|Based on the actual Apollo 13 space mission, Ron Howard directs this amazing film that not only centers around the struggle to bring back to earth three astronauts in a doomed space craft, but it also focuses on the emotional impact that this actual event had on the families of the astronauts and the entire nation.  The talented actors, Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon portray the three astronauts who are estatic about receiving the opportunity to land and walk on the moon.  However, the entire mission is soon in peril when something goes terribly wrong.  The mission control crew attempts everything possible to bring the astronauts safely home.  In the meantime, the three astronauts struggle to maintain their composure and sanity as they also try everything to arrive home to their anxious families.  This 2 hour and 20 minute video is a must for anyone's video collection, with fabulous graphics and emotional dialogue.  I've viewed it several times, and it never gets boring.
0064407667|4.0|Why my daughter and I enjoyed reading about bad luck that happens time after time to the unlucky Beaudelaires is beyond me - but we did. Each of the seven books in the series so far has similarities but enough unpredictability to make each book worth reading. Violet and Klaus are likeable and empathy-inspiring characters.
B00005B36H|5.0|I dont feel like typing much but just a little word of advide: listen to this CD, over and over...it keeps getting better like a fine wine.<br />At first listen, the Grudge, Parabola, Ticks and Leeches will grab your attention, as well as Schism since its the first single and you probably already heard it numerous times on the radio.<br />After a few listens you will quickly come to realise that the true beauty of this CD lies within these tracks: -the patient, disposition/reflection and ...one, if not the most beautiful song i have ever heard, Lateralus (or Lateralis if you bought the first shipment).<br />Tool really creates something beautiful and inspiring here, most of the songs crack the 7min mark which is bad for radio/video promotion, but then again what else could you expect from these geniuses.<br />Ok im done...do yourself a favor and buy this CD if you havnt already.
B00004ZD69|5.0|Huh. This is the first album I've heard of GYBE, after listening to praise them like the second coming, and I somehow thought the  real thing would pale in comparison. Wrong. I found it strangely engrossing, undeniably compelling. It's not quite what I'm used to, what with no proper vocals and twenty-minute tracks, but it's all extremely interesting without being too cerebral to enjoy. The spoken samples are cleverly used and are sometimes extremely creepy (the preacher). The album begs to be listened to in one long stretch; when you do, it pulls you into a dark landscape of sound that seems to stay with you after the last notes have died off. It's not a perfect album, but it's perfectly wonderful.
B0000024K1|4.0|this is the best country music album of all time but if they had gotten rid of flava flav it would be even better wazzup wit dem clocks!?!?
B00003CXDZ|4.0|But I did. All I had to do was get through the first 20 minutes of the movie and I ended up really enjoying it. I guess it is kinda like shock therapy. They give you the over-the-top stuff at the beginning to get you to suspend disbelief and into the rest of the movie. At first, my friend and I looked at each other and the only reason I stayed in my seat was the fact that I had heard so many good things about it. So we stayed and I'm glad that I did.<br />Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor were wonderful to watch, and they did an exceptional job with the songs. Speaking of the songs, I expected the modern songs with the period setting to be distracting, but they were not. They added to the fun of the movie and I enjoyed hearing the familiar songs in such unusual settings. (There is a VERY interesting scene to Madonna's Like a Virgin that I will not soon forget!)<br />Anyone interested should definitely see this movie in the theater as you may need no distraction to really get you into the story. My friend said that if she were watching this at home she would have turned it off in the first 5 minutes, but she was glad she saw it in the theater as she ended up really enjoying it -- as did I.
0061001783|5.0|Cotillion was only the second Heyer Regency, or for that matter any type of adult romance, I read.  (The also wonderful Grand Sophy was my first.)  I agree with the other posters in their praise of what I believe to be her finest book.  I have read it many times as it is my favorite, well along with the Grand Sophy, and Devil's Cub, and The Reluctant Widow, and Sylvester,and the Nonesuch, and oh dear!  The best praise I can bestow is that it was enough to make me hopelessly and very obviously addicted to Heyer.  It is well worth your time.
B00005176F|5.0|...Was the last thing I expected to hear from the totally apathetic, into-grunge-looking cashier at the music store when I bought this. I was so shocked I didn't know what to say, except that I thought I'd heard that too. Why I was really buying this CD was because I saw the video for &quot;Coffee and TV&quot; on MTV2 for the first time in a long time, and I was starting to get into Gorillaz anyway too, and all of a sudden I really wanted this album. I'd never bought a Blur CD before; usually I buy the CD that, little to my knowledge, was critically acclaimed upon its release, but I buy it on average two years later then discover its hype. About this album... Ever buy a CD expecting it to be really good, though you don't exactly know why, listen to it once, and have to listen to it several more times to get accustomed to it and really begin liking it after a slight, initial disappointment? This is NOT one of those albums. This is one that you might know a couple songs off of (&quot;Song 2&quot;, from a zillion commercials and every major televised sporting event ever, &quot;Girls and Boys&quot;, maybe from some MTV Spring Break specials aside from the radio, and &quot;Coffe and TV&quot; by the adorable dancing milk carton video), but, if Blur's new to you, you can play this CD over and over and over, but by the 1st repeat you've already decided what your favorite songs are (mine are &quot;The Universal&quot;, &quot;End of a Century&quot;, &quot;Tender&quot;, &quot;On Your Own&quot;, and &quot;Music is My Radar&quot;) aside from the farmiliar ones mentioned. I was listening to this album on-and-off for like 2 days straight. Plus I was really surprised that the price was so low considering there was a whole bonus live CD. Usually box sets are really expensive. So overall I was definitely pleased that this wasn't a waste of money and will probably serve as a bridge to getting more into Blur and buying some of their older stuff.
B00005ATQI|3.0|If The Shining were about camera work and atmosphere only, it would rank with Kubrick's best, which is to say about as good as the movies get. To Kubrick's handheld camera and cinematic imagination, the hotel's vast empty corridors and adjacent rooms become a labyrinth of horror in which evil of any kind might emerge. Only The Sixth Sense, of recent vintage, comes close to capturing the same spooky anything-can-happen atmosphere of the Shining's Overlook Hotel. If the film were about script only, it would still rate an arguable 5 stars, as Kubrick &amp; Co. substitute mood and spectral apparitions in place of the book's hokier parts, such as flying topiary. Nor do I think the film is overlong, since a leisurely buildup is essential to the crashing, mind-altering climax.<br />But this is not the early Kubrick, the sure-hand behind Paths of Glory, Dr. Strangelove, or 2001. This is Kubrick in decline. A director who either cannot or will not control the wild excesses of his celebrity-star Jack Nicholson in the film's pivotal role. In a part that fairly cries out for sublety and nuance, especially in limning the descent into madness, we get instead a leering, smirking self parody of an actor obviously wallowing in a chance to pull out all stops. And who can believe that that dreadful mood-killing line, &quot;Here'sss Johnny!&quot; is actually in the script. Rarely has such a grossly self-indulgent performance been allowed to reach the screen in unaltered form. And for that, there is only Kubrick to ultimately blame.<br />I realize I risk offending Nicholson's legion of fans for whom this &quot;cool dude&quot; can do no wrong. But the fact is he traded in his acting credentials soon after Cuckoo's Nest for the easier road of self-parody, in which the silk purse of Five Easy Pieces becomes the sow's ear of the typical Nicholson Role. I care because in more disciplined hands - say an Anthony Hopkins - this could have been a great movie, instead of the artistic irritant itfinally is.
0195067142|5.0|I was a Marine in the Gulf War, and earned a couple other combat action ribbons. Of course, never had to go through what the Marines of WWII did. But the thing I loved the most about this book compared to other accounts of war, is the details he mentions. Like how fighting for weeks without bathing or even shaving can have a real impact on you. And what it's like in a foxhole during a war. For anyone that thought D-Day or any of the Marine landings in the Pacific had glamour and excitement, really needs to read this.
B00004XQ83|4.0|....The movie, a modern take on Homer's The Odyssey, has some of the best music that I have heard in awhile.  The songs are from a variety of artists that include Alison Krauss, Emmylou Harris, The Cox Family and The Soggy Bottom Boys and have a country-bluesy-gospel feel.  The guitar rythms are toe-tappin', whether slow or fast, and the high-pitched voices from songs like \\"I am a Man of Constant Sorrow\\" are clean and clear.  This is definitely a cd to buy for those of you into the old-time, REAL country music and even for those who like today's country.
6304493681|3.0|As a major sci-fi lover, I found this to be a dissapointment after all the rave reviews.  I was debating whether to give this 2 or 3 stars, and ended up with 3 only because the Audio and Video quality was very good.  The plot is difficult to follow and I can hang with even the best technobabble filled plots.  In this case, the conmstant meaningless technobabble and plot were hard to follow leading to a poor experience.  It was if way too much of the movie was an 'inside joke' type of experience.  I did not gain anything pleasurable or meaningful from this 'Anime'.  Unless you are a proven Anime fan, I'd rent this DVD (at best).  Usually I am very enthusiatic when it comes to anything sci-fi, but this did nothing for me.

The Dialog and interaction between Young Darth Vader and his mother was just APPALING.  Way too 'see spot run'.  I'm just dissapointed with LUCAS and his attempt to 'clean-up' all his films.  Let's just shoot for a G-rating next time Mr. Lucas?<br />I love Star Wars 4-6 but this was the biggest dissapointment yet. I'm sick of the rated G mentality.
0805062971|4.0|Palahniuk's now legendary novel, &quot;Fight Club&quot;, remains one of the more biting criticisms of our times against commercialism and the susceptibility of today's society. A fast-paced and intriguing novel, Palahniuk loses you in the reckless world of Tyler Durden and his actions, an infatuation with someone one could never be.<br />Although the book itself is some 200 pages, it really reads like it's 150 or so. The chapters are short, brief snippets of the narrator's view into society. Not only does Palahniuk keep you engaged through this but also gives you a near stream-of-conciousness style of writing, engaging in tangents about Tyler Durden and his hatred of Marla.<br />While most of the exposure of the book is directly corrolated with the immense success of the movie, the novel, as a stand alone work, is immensely enjoyable. Palahniuks constant prodding at societal mediums (movies, the emergency cards in air planes) and almost humorous cynicism towards the brainwashing of society (&quot;His name is Robert Paulson. His name is Robert Paulson&quot;) makes this novel one of the best of the past decade, a worthy addition to any library.
B000002BUY|5.0|I remade my review, 'cause the older one didn't do this album justice. When S.C.I.E.N.C.E. came out in 1997, there was nothing else like it. No band had captured the unique musicality and funkiness like Incubus. Fungus Amongus and Enjoy set the precedent, and Make Yourself couldn't live up. Here's a track-by-track:<br />1.)Redefine: 9/10-Great opener. Shows off Brandon skillish rapping ability right out of the gate. Sweet bass solo, too. The song is also an original way of expressing the whole 'you can't change me' attitude.<br />2.)Vitamin: 8/10-It's okay. It has a nice buildup in the beginning, but loses much of Redefine's momentum.<br />3.)New Skin: 10/10-This song was a hit for a reason. Patton-like rapping, lots of bongos, and a raw, heavy, riff at lightspeed. That's great.<br />4.)Idiot Box: 8/10-Good lyrics-very true. The slow groove is good for the song, although it makes it very boring.<br />5.)Glass: 10/10-That's funky right there at the beginning with the cool twangy guitar thing. The song builds into a great chorus. However, the language is very strong.<br />6.)Magic Medicine: 7/10-An entertaining little instrumental, but \\"Battlestar\\" is much better.<br />7.)Certain Shade Of Green: 1000000/10-This song kicks ... The explosive main riff rocks. The lyrics are humorous, and the scratching by Kid Lyfe is so well-timed and crisp, the song wins the cake and prize for my fave Incubus song.<br />8.)Favorite Things: 9/10-A nice little song that for some reason everyone enjoys.<br />9.)Summer Romance[Anti-Gravity Love Song]: 8/10-Lounge-ish type dance ballad that really showcases Brandon's vocal talent. Sax solo is great.<br />10.)Nebula: 3/10-The only bad song on here. The singing is done in the stupidest way, and the middle of the song is just insane to the point where the song ...<br />11.)Deep Inside: 10/10-Funkadelic! This sounds like a polished FA track, and houses an incredible solo from Mike at the end, plus a humorous and well-timed line from Brandon. Great song.<br />12.)Calgone: 10/10-Starts off real bad, and then blows up into a screaming rapmetal frenzy. Slows down again, and alternates between a myriad of styles until the hilarious, expletive-ridden climax.<br />13.)Hidden Track: 10/10-12 minutes of funny episodes filled with sound effects and gags to last a lifetime. Wonderful!<br />There's also an ECD with some cool stuff, making this an unbelievably complete record from one of the most innovative new bands out there: Incubus! Not nu-metal at all, the closest working categorization would be jazz/hip-hop-infused funk-metal.
B00000I8BX|4.0|I first found out about this CD when I bought a compilation that featured Fear Factory.  I listened to a few sound samples of this CD on the internet and the shockingly loud songs practically frightened me.  This was a few years ago.  Recently, I bought this CD and I decided things had changed.     First off, this CD is not nearly as extreme as I remembered it.  With song titles like, &quot;Smasher/Devourer&quot; and &quot;Edgecrusher,&quot; I expected a brutally loud, death/industrial metal CD.  What I got was something a bit different.     That's not to say that this CD is bad.  It's pretty good.  The vocalist is very talented; his voice ranges from very melodic, unique singing to gutteral roars.  The guitars are nice and crunchy, while not sounding very complex.  The drumming is pretty good while keyboards and programming make a nice finishing touch to each song.  This CD is hardcore, just not quite as hardcore as I expected, so naturally, I was a little disappointed.     Fear Factory has a fairly unique sound.  My favorite songs are &quot;Shock,&quot; &quot;Edgecrusher,&quot; &quot;Smasher/Devourer,&quot; &quot;Securitron,&quot; &quot;Hi-Tech Hate,&quot; &quot;Obsolete,&quot; and &quot;Timelessness.&quot;  On tracks 9 and 10, FF shows their musical diversity by incorporating a string arrangement into the music.  The particular version of this CD that I own only has one bonus track, &quot;Cars.&quot;  It's alright, but doesn't add much.     To sum up, this CD is good, just not what I expected.
B000053VAF|4.0|Dogma is a great example of how Kevin Smith can keep the New Jersey series going while not focusing on &quot;a day in the life&quot; stories.  In my view, Dogma is a good comedy with good acting.  Smith brings the bible to life (sort of) and makes it funny!  Affleck &amp; Damon put on a good show.  The movies content itself involves some bible characters and bible mythology.   For people that are looking for &quot;Clerks&quot; &quot;Mallrats&quot; and &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; type stories, you won't find that here.  But if you give Smith a chance, this movie will win you over.  And besides, it has Jay and Silent Bob in it, what else do you need?!
B00000JPHG|5.0|I enjoyed it a lot. It was funny and one of the best endings. Get it.
0449227421|2.0|A friend turned me on to Ken in high school and I have read every single book that he has ever written.  I loved them all.  Pillars of the Earth, Night Over Water, Eye of the Needle, Man from St. Petersburg, even Dangerous Fortune.  <br />For some reason though, his books have been detiorating.  A Place Called Freedom was a boring romance (disguised as historical) novel and now this.  Follett is a master at making us understand his characters thought processes and he draws them out with such precision.  But in this case, the characters were shallow, the book predictable.<br />If you're looking for quality Follett, don't read his recent stuff.  Stick with his classics.  Start with Eye of the Needle.
0790729628|3.0|My VHS copy of Blade Runner is getting old, so I went ahead and bought the DVD of the &quot;Director's cut&quot; even though I had already seen it and was very dissapointed. I was suprised to get TWO versions of the film on the DVD: a standard version and a widescreen version. That's nice. The interactive menu, especially the scene access section, was pretty lame, however. It seems that not much thought was put into this. Also, the movie seems to play automatically and with subtitles, so you have to stop and turn off the subtitles then restart the movie!<br />As for the movie itself, I have said I didn't like the director's cut very much and watching this DVD didn't help matters any. The omitted voice-over by Harrison Ford is the biggest problem. Those scenes where he had been talking are now uncomfortably long and silent. If Scott was so insistent on taking out the voice-over, why didn't he tighten up those scenes so it would be more watchable? As it is now, we see Harrison Ford just gazing off into space and we don't know what he's thinking or what purpose these long shots of him just sitting there are supposed to have.<br />And another thing: the so-called unicorn dream. Part of Scott's original vision? I don't think so. Obviously, this was lifted from his film, Legend, and inserted into Blade Runner to connect with the foil unicorn Deckard finds at the end of the film. It doesn't fit with the rest of the film at all. It's an afterthought, hardly the director's &quot;original vision.&quot;<br />Probably my biggest question with the whole movie is what happened to the last Replicant? We are told six &quot;skin-jobs&quot; jumped ship and came to Earth, but one got fried trying to break into the Tyrell corporation complex. Lets's count now. That leaves five. Rutger Hauer is one, Daryl Hannah is two, &quot;Leon&quot; is three, and &quot;Zorah(?)&quot; the snake dancer is four. What happened to the fifth one? This is never explained and if you start thinking that Harrison Ford is the fifth Replicant, then the entire storyline pretty much falls apart with &quot;then why didn't they...&quot; and &quot;then how come they didn't recognize...&quot; questions.<br />All in all, a fair DVD of a messed up version of a good movie. I wish I could get the original version on DVD.
0671042858|5.0|Big Steve is back, and he's at the top of his form.  This is just an amazing piece of work.  Much shorter that King is used to writing- he's learning the difference between a novel and a phone book.<br />Central to the story is Trisha, a nine year old girl who can only be described as spunky.  She and her brother are trying to recover from their parents' divorce.  Mom takes the kids on a nature hike.  Trisha gets off the path to answer nature's call, and things go downhill from there.<br />The main character is so real that I had to read the whole thing in one night so as to find out what happens to her.  After all, just because you're a little kid doesn't grant you immunity from death and pain in King's stories- witness PET SEMETARY, SALEM'S LOT, and most especially CUJO.<br />Almost as interesting as the main character is the setting.  I live in central Texas and DARN but I want to go to Maine next summer.  I want to smell those trees and see those stars at night myself.  There are scenes in this book of such beauty that you can temporarily forget the grave danger that Trisha is in.<br />Good work, Big Steve!
B00003CX8V|4.0|The Apartment is a 5 star movie that has just recently beentransfered to dvd.  Howerver the dvd [is bad].  I still suggest getting it just because the high quality of the movie.  If you have never seen it get it and if you are a fan of the movie like I am get it there's no question about that.  I'm sure that in 2-3 years they will put out a better version to make more money off of us, and I will buy that too, But we will worrie about that when it happens.
0920236162|5.0|Princess Elizabeth's world gets destroyed by a dragon - her castle is smashed, her clothes are burned, and her Prince is carried off by a dragon.<br />Does Elizabeth sit back and let the dragon win? Nope.<br />She puts on a paperbag and heads out to rescue her man. She puts her smarts to good use and defeats the dragon. No violence. <br />And for her troubles? Ronald yells at her!! What's a Princess to do? She tells him off an skips off into the sunset.<br />I loved Elizabeth's resoursefulness. I loved how the test of her character showed her that Ronald wasn't the Prince for her. I loved how, instead of weeping over the loss of such an unprincely Prince, she dances off into the sunset.<br />This book is one of my all-time favorite stories.
B00000K19E|5.0|I went to see this film at the movies, and was not expecting much.Boy, how wrong could i be! i enjoyed it so much i went back the following day and watched it again! Although i have the region 2 version of this film, i'm sure there is not many differences, i would reccomend this to any one who doesn't mind thinking about a film, as a lot of people i know said they found it confusing, i did not however.Excellent special FX , excellent acting, excellent storyline. It makes you fell like a kid again, by the way it makes you want to be Neo, and learn Kung-Fu in a few minutes.I can't wait for the sequels. :o)
078062999X|5.0|Hamlet is my favorite play by the Bard, besides Titus Andronicus anyway. Branagh did a fabulous job of bringing Ol' William's magnum opus to the modern day &quot;theatre.&quot; I only have a few nitpicky complaints. The first few scenes with the ghost are pretty, but the visuals can get distractng. All of the various cameo appearances also tend to be a little distracting, but the only one that REALLY stands out is Jack Lemmon's Marcellus (one of those &quot;what the heck is he doing here?&quot; sort of things). Kate Winslet did a good Ophelia, but she got a little whiny in some parts. Horatio was a little too reserved, but it worked. Laertes was portrayed as being too old in my opinion. The play gives off vibes of a brash young bravo, ready to get himself killed in the name of pride, not some foppish, spoiled noble. I thought that Billy Krystal played the gravedigger smarter than he probably should have, but that part, too, worked. The final nitpick is at the end when Branagh shows Osiric getting stabbed by one of Fortinbras's troops. That wasn't in the play, and it served no useful point in the plot of the movie, so I think Branagh should've elimanted that detail. Other than those minor complaints, I heartily reccomend this film to movie, theatre, and Shakespeare lovers everywhere.
B00005B7CK|4.0|If the thing that attracts you in Coen brothers films is the thrills or the dynamity, you better leve this one in the shop. But if you are into their movies because of the lovable characters or just the general &quot;feel to it&quot;, ou should have a go. It is not as violent or dark as Miller's Crossing or Fargo, not as sharp as Big Lebowski, but it is so sympatethic that you can't go wrong with it. There are still funny characters in it, although nothing quite hilarious as Jesus Quintana, Mike Yanagita, Marge Gunderson or Carl Showalter. The best thing in it is the music; &quot;Man Of Constant Sorrow&quot; , for example, stucked to my head instantly, although my musical taste is usually far from roots or bluegrass. Only if you are a Homer's Odyssey purist, you might be dissappointed, because although it is loosely based on it, it's far cry from it, really. This is probably the best Coen movie for those who don't even like Coen brothers' films. Highly recommended.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This is a good album. Buy it. Seriously. Being a staunch Radiohead fan, I love this work more than any of the other four offerings by these talented Brits. This album got me back in to Radiohead after my intial disappointment with &quot;The Bends&quot; (which I now have newfound adoration for). The first time I heard the song &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; I was actually sitting up at one in the morning reading part of Douglas Adams's (May the almighty Bob rest his soul) Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series. It was a groovy song and the Adams reference hooked me into buying the album. That one particular song is a good example of Radiohead's over all sound; one can see the more traditional, matured style that was Pablo Honey and The Bends, and the roots of the musical &quot;transcendentalism&quot; found in Kid A and Amnesiac. The rest of the CD is also terrific, but two songs stand out: Karma Police and Exit Music. Karma Police was a nice soft song with great lyrics and vocals. Exit Music was used at the end of Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet. The mixed emotions of optimism and despair mesh nicely in the song and it worked well in the movie. The final score: If you like soft modern rock buy this NOW!!! OK Computer will give you a good feel for the range of tones that Radiohead delivers and will probably convince you to give their other albums a listen.
6305807043|5.0|One of the best movies in recent memory, Bein John malkovich is certainly among the most original Hollywood films ever made. Containing stunning visuals, positively confusing plot and hilarious situations, it is a ture masterpiece. If you like movies such as Con Air or Eraser, this might not the be what you are looking for, but if you are keeping an open mind or looking for a challenging comedy, this is a definitive answer to yor prayers. Being John Malkovich makes art out of oddity. A true masterpiece.
B00005B4GU|4.0|I've been a fan of Radiohead since I heard &quot;Creep&quot; for the first time way back in 1993 when I still lived in Nashville. I own all of their albums (although my copy of Pablo Honey was loaned to someone and I forgot who) and love every minute of their music. It was a pleasant surprise to hear that the band was going to be releasing two new albums within a years time. I hope they can use the rest of the '&quot;Kid A&quot;' session material for a third album sometime soon. Anyway, down to business.    This album is wonderful. Saying more or less about it would be a waste. The tone is similar to Kid A, but different enough to justify the band's idea of releasing the material as a different album. The only complaint I have (and this is the reason for the 4 instead of 5 stars) is that the songs don't flow across the album like they did with Kid A. There's no real continuity to it. Each individual song is great, but you lose the near seamless, trippy effect that made Kid A so fun to listen to.  The final score: If you're a Radiohead fan, buy this immediately and slap yourself for not buying at 12:01 AM the morning it came out. If you've only been a casual follower of the group, spend the night with one of your R-H fanatic friends and have them put the album in about 30 minutes before you're ready to go to bed, and see if you jive with it. On that note, this album, like all Radiohead is fantastic sleeping music, but Kid A is slightly better for that purpose. The final, final score: As good as Kid A, but OK Computer is still my favorite album.
B00003CXN4|1.0|I was shocked by the movie because it was so long and drawn out. There I was also amazed that it had won alot of awards. The movie went nowhere through out the beginning to the end. The characters weren't developed enough to understand them emotionally. The plot never thickened nor was there ever a climax(the part where you are on the edge of your seat) The only thing I was doing in my seat was dozing in and out of pure boredom!! I mean did the people giving out the awards actually watch the movie????? Or did they just see the list of stars?? I do not recommend this to anyone at all!!!
B00003CX5P|5.0|Only pseudo-intellectuals hated this movie. Those fat, ugly, virgin, pizza eating computer geeks who feel for some reason as if Lucas owes them something. For some reason they all think the original trilogy was dark and morose and horrid and wrecthed. Those were meant for the family and so is this one. I loved this movie the second i saw it. So did everybody else. They just wanted to fit in and be cool and all simultaneously said they hated it in order to look cool and fit in with the crowd. The movie is great beyond a shadow of a doubt.
B00003CX8V|5.0|Here's one of the all-time great films that features Shirley MacLaine when she only had one life (and wasn't apparently planning to have any more than that), and Jack Lemmon when he was still interested in turning in a honest performance and not in collecting awards, and the remarkable Billy Wilder, pulling the whole thing together at the peak of his form. Even Fred MacMurray (whose performances were usually on a par with blancmange) plays a fine, believable villain. The Apartment also has one of my all-time favorite scenes: Jack Lemmon straining spaghetti with a tennis racket.<br />Not to be missed!
0385495323|4.0|This book is a eclectic mix of codemaking, codebreaking and the use of ciphers throughout history.  For a beginner in cryptography, some of the technical stretches are a bit tough, but well worth the effort.  I learned a lot from this book.<br />The first 100 pages cover the history of (western) cryptography from ancient Greek steganography through the end of the 19th century with Marconi &amp; the invention of the Wireless.  In between, he speeds through Arab cryptanalysis (a real revelation to me), the Vigenere Cipher, the Great Cipher of Louis XIV (invented by the Rossignols and broken by Bazeries), Samuel Morse &amp; the Telegraph (better communication needed ciphers), Charles Babbage, and the Beale Papers.  The author gives equal respect and technical coverage to both the cipher 'creators' as well as the cipher 'breakers'.<br />The next 200 pages cover 20th century topics, events and famous characters in cryptography.  The Enigma Machine/Code -- designed by the Germans, then cracked by Poland (Marian Rejewski) on the eve of the German invasion; refortified by the Germans, then cracked again at Bletchley Park during WWII by a wondrous team, including Alan Turing.  The Zimmerman Telegram and the Navaho Code Talkers each receive very nice treatment.  Even the history of the decipherment of Egyptian Hieroglyphics and Linear B (both, as it turns out, 'phonetic' codes) receive technical treatment. <br />Singh rounds out the historical discussion with the discoveries (or re-discoveries) of 'key exchange' by Diffie-Hellman-Markle, and complex cryptographic systems like DES and RSA encryption architecture.  Phil Zimmerman and PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) rate more than a dozen pages, bringing the book right into the Internet age.<br />The author concludes with a discussion of the Future of Cryptanalysis and Quantum Computing (including a brief tutorial on Quantum Physics for Dummies).<br />The book has swell appendices, a glossary, a comprehensive bibliography and an index.  The author generously points the reader to David Kahn's mammoth 1200-page The Codebreakers as an &quot;invaluable resource&quot; (pretty classy stuff).
B00005B36H|1.0|It shouldn't be a suprise that Tool's latest release &quot;Laterlus&quot; is a lackluster, commercial effort since it followed the equally commercial release of &quot;A Perfect Circle&quot;.<br />I never thought that I'd see the day that Maynard would sell out. This release is stale, monotonous, and repetitive. It seems that the members of Tool were more involved with the packaging than with the music. Of course, to the masses, &quot;Laterlus&quot; will be hailed as a masterpiece. <br />Tool does nothing new, nothing innovative, nothing gripping. The cd is frankly one big potpourri of songs ripped off from their own library of music.  <br />After having to swallow the muck &quot;LATERLUS&quot; has to offer, listening to the earlier material becomes increasingly more  difficult because after the mystique they had created as a band, how can one take them seriously now?
0385486804|5.0|Krakauer is an excellent author.  He takes non-fiction and makes it readable and entertaining.  I became as enthralled with his real life story and information as in any fiction book.  I rarely read non-fiction, but just ate this book up.  A rich account of a fascinating young man and his attempt to live in the wild, including some of his history and motivations.  The combination of events that occur on his adventure and the culmination of those events is fascinating.
0553108034|2.0|I was quite keen to get started with this series, after reading some of the reviews on this site. Now after finishing this second book, I am not so keen any longer. George Martins choice of telling the story through 10+ different characters tend to make for a shallow story telling. There is little variation on the written style in between the different characters, which seems distanced and very neutral in the first place. Many of the emotions the characters are supposedly experiencing, are usually being explained beforehand, to color the otherwise weak dialogue between characters. I would have preferred more emphasis on the dialogue itself by far. A good example of a book series using several main characters to tell a storyline, with varied language style to tell the characters apart is the Hyperion series by Dan Simmons. Another thing which makes A Song og Ice and Fire a bit more difficult to swallow, is the speech and thoughts used in the first person perspective of the young children. Bran is 7, Arya 9, and Sansa 11 in the beginning of the book series, and at the end of book 2, 2 years have passed. But one ought to believe they were 40+ years old from the language and trains of thought they go on. There is quite many details on the sigils of the different houses, many details and descriptions of the different interrelations of the many nobles, however I find it a bit overdone, especially when George Martin spends half a page describing/listing names of nobles in a newly arrived party, just to have the names show up again as an anecdote in a later chapter, where it is learned that such and such a person died in some battle. I have spent the time reading the books, and will probably finish the rest of the series when it comes out, however I must say that mostly I felt as if I was sitting with some sort of soap opera of epic fantasy, and this series will go on for a looong time without really hinting why or for what.
0553106635|5.0|If I had the power, I'd crown a new king of fantasy.  G.R.R, the other R.R., seems to get better with every book.  Unlike the majority of fantasy authors in business today, Martin decided to wow us with realism and gripping plotlines, as opposed to dragons and wizards shooting fire every few pages.  I read this book in two and a half days, and I'm still confused why it took me so long.  Read this series, please, you will be better for the experience, and you might even begin to respect yourself.  I know i did.
B00000K19E|5.0|This is a great movie to watch!! The special effects are great and the story is very different from other action packed movies!! Good acting by keanu, carrie-anne moss and lawrence fishbourne. <br />Watching The Matrix on DVD makes it even better because you can watch it in widerscreen and the sound is clearer!! This dvd also provides behind the scenes look and dditional features for the dvd-rom. This movie also won 4 oscars, including 1 for special effects and one for the soundtrack, so watching it on dvd is great, cos you can choose on only listening to the background score of the matrix while watching the movie!!<br />All in all, this is a good addition to your dvd collection!

B000002KKC|4.0|By 1978, Lindsey Buckingham had grown tired of the music he was making on huge albums like &quot;Rumours.&quot; He swore that Fleetwood Mac would be given a totally different sound: and he delivered. With some drum tracks recorded by Buckingham himself in his garage, this album is an avant garde effort that shows pure genius fitting along with insecurity. Overall: Although for a fan, this will be most certainly be recognized as a favorite album, the common buyer should stay away from this album's unfamiliar sounds and quirky melodies.
B000050XEI|5.0|I had never heard of Enya before I first heard &quot;Only Time&quot; play in the theatre as I waited for the movie to start. I'd never heard that before, and it was such lovely music. It reminded me of &quot;Orinico Flow&quot; (I didn't know that it was called Orinico Flow at the time), or at least the instruments sounded like it. After the song was done playing, I heard them say it was  &quot;Only Time&quot; from the CD &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot; by Enya. After that I immediately bought the CD, and listened to the other great songs! This is the first CD of Enya I've ever bought and actually heard, and now it's making me buy more of Enya's work. I really love this CD, the music is so peaceful and calming, and it shows how nice a voice Enya has and her and the Ryans' talent with creating this music. I recommend getting this CD if you are just getting into Celtic music, or if you are curious about Enya's music, because I'm sure you'll be pleased with it. =)
B000002KXO|4.0|Following the hugely popular album, &quot;Rumours,&quot; and the artistic effort, &quot;Tusk,&quot; Mirage featured a side of the band that was much different from anything before. By its release, Lindsey Buckingham had a butnout with the music he was recording, and fell interested in such bands as &quot;The Clash.&quot; Its sound is apparent on the entire album, with an even edgier ambience on such gems as &quot;Empire State,&quot; and &quot;Straight Back.&quot; Stevie's songwriting couldnt have been better, and Christine was completely up to par. With a finalized Eddy Cochrane glow, the majorly irredescent album shines and bathes in a light created by Mick Fleetwood's dueling percussion and John McVie's complicated and creative Bass. Overall: A great album which only lacks the time at which it was released: This would have been an amazing effort if only it preceded &quot;Rumours.&quot;
B00005B36H|5.0|No person can dislike this album and still claim to be a Tool fan.<br />As with many Tool fans, I have waited several years for this album, and it was not in vain.  The band has evolved yet again, incorporating new concepts into their sound flawlessly, while retaining that quality which makes them the band we have come to love.  I prefer to listen to this album from beginning to end, without interuption...it just feels wrong to me to skip around.  I feel a concept running through the music that is better appreciated when it's listened to in full.  But that's just me.  Listen to it and decide for yourself...
B000000HTM|1.0|After all, there is nothing interesting and exciting in their music. There are so many listenable music out there.
B00003CXN4|1.0|My husband and I love Michael's movie. But this one is the worst of the worst movie that he had even made. His wife look so old and ugly, we can hardly believe ourselves that it's her in the movie. not worth the effort to watch it at all..trust me..
B00004XONN|1.0|I'm sorry but if I bottled my dog's excrement it would be better than this garbage-- Kid A. The band does not even try to make sense anymore and apparently spent too much time in the studio working on this annoying, repetitive, plodding release. I would not recommend this horse bowel movement to my worst enemy.
0812548094|5.0|I have written a review for WFR and after reading some more I have decided to annoy every single person who has read Robert Jordan. <br />Terry GOodkind writes much more egrossing stories that display much more emotional characteristics than Robert Jordan's. The relationship between Rand and Egwene really isn't that engrossing. I think that Rnad should go with the Woman In White instead just to make it interesting!<br />Also, about comparisons.  I have read some Robert Jordan. They were good, but not really my style. The love-stuff is completely unrealistic and some people fall in love with Rand  realy uncharacteristically. True, Aes Sedai, Clack Ajah, Whitecloaks, I could go on forever. but the thing is, the core of imagination stems from reality and what you know. The truth is, if things weren't already there, people wouldn't be expanding on that idea and making it bigger. Take birds for example, they fly. Chances are a human being probably wouldn't imagine flying if there weren't beings that already could fly. The imagination is an expansion of knowledge, not something picked up out of nowhere. Also, Terry Goodkind's books are like Marmite, you love them or you hate them. You don't really get that many in betweens though there are some. I think this is because you either agree with his morals and are fanatically involved with them (like me: I try them out after I find out another e.g.Wizards First Rule. A friend claimed she was feeling carsick. I gave her a 'tablet for carsickness'. Immediately she felt better. the tablet only works after two hours) or you totally disagree with them and try to find out every single flaw with them.<br />Don't read any reviews that tell you not to read a book. It's your own decision and it's your own morals that have to relate
B00004RF98|5.0|The best musical ever.  Buy it.  Own it.  Watch it.  Love it.
6304981635|5.0|Can't really add much - the film is fantastic. Forget the plot, you want the fight scenes, where Bruce avenges his sister, where he beats Han, the Numchuck scene (banned in the UK since 1973), the subtle humour (the snake, the &quot;fighting without fighting bit....), I just love the film.<br />I have to say that although I understand the &quot;racism&quot; comments regarding Jim Kelly, I thought the only reason Han beat him was because he got distracted by a faceful of Dove and took a stone hand in the face. Pure bad luck. And the only reason he stole the police car was for a quick getaway, otherwise he'd probably have caught a cab.<br />But I agree, he's a far better fighter than John Saxon, and it would have been nice if he'd stuck around in the movie for longer.<br />Peace.
B000002OZY|5.0|what is all the buzz about? let's see, the greatest lyrics, great music all topped with some great artwork and the sound quality of the remastered clears the tape hiss balances out the sound.  Captain Walker doesn't return home from war and is apparantly dead, he returns to find his wife with a new lover and the lover thinks he's an intruder and attacks Captain Walker and Walker kills the new lover.  Tommy witnesses everything in the mirror and the parents tell him it's a figure of imagination and never really happened and that he didn't hear it, see it, or think anything of it, hence death, dumb, and blind boy.  After the parents convince him about this the mirror puts a curse on him and is never freed, and get's molested by his uncle Ernie and tied up and beat up by his Cousin Kevin.  Tommy is introduced to a pinball machine and leads a following.  Tommy's Mom is fed up with Tommy's behavior and how he can't be cured so she decides to smash the mirror curing Tommy and he starts his own Holiday camp and rejoices. May sound stupid but oh my god the music can also be used to tell a story, the who and townshend are genious!
B00005BJC7|5.0|Amnesiac is an album which, listened as a whole extracts all inner emotions of the listener and elevates them to some subliminal level...enough said, try listening to Whose Army? and Knives Out in the dark, and singing along with Thom, you'll feel the hair on your back stand in cold sweat. Almost haunting by nature, Amnesiac is one album which keeps the listener awake long after the horns section in Glasshouse ceases...!!! Oh yeah, the artwork by Stanley &amp; Tchock in the L.E also complements the surreal imagery that plays in your head when it starts to reach into the emotional depth of the music! 5 Stars for another 100 years!
B000002U82|5.0|exactly what I said before, what is wrong with this album? probably the fact that it's 28 years old but my god is it great! You start out listening to &quot;Speak to me&quot; which is a short instrumental with talking and clinging cash sounds from &quot;Money&quot; with a fade of musical genious into &quot;Breathe.&quot; When I heard this album I never bothered skipping a song because that ruins the whole experience of Dark Side of the Moon, every track needs to be played through because the album continues like it's one whole song.  There is some nice synth work on this album that is superior by today's standards even if today's music completely sucks!  I would have to say this is my favorite rock and roll album and Physical Graffiti is my favorite from Zeppelin, I suggest you buy this!!!!!!
B00004XQP4|4.0|Alright, maybe this cd wasn't their best work if you were looking for a cd that sounds like all the rest, but i think that Green Day really dosn't really care if their new stuff dos'nt appeal to everyone. They're most likly proud of this cd, as anyone would be. They've been around for a while and they have made complete growth since 1039 Smoothed Out Slappy Hours. That's as it should be too. They don't care if it sounds like a wuss cd to you they even said so in a review i heard. Billie Joe said, &quot; If it sounds like a wuss cd to you, that's because it is.&quot; They know what they're doing and they're not ashamed. I'd be proud of myself right now if i were them. All people look at if they say someone sold out these days is whether or not their cd sounds exactly like their last. And that's not possible nor is it right...... so maybe we should look a little farther than that eh?<br />I enjoyed the change, though it is by far not my favorite cd, i hope they keep on going.
B000002AGN|5.0|40 years after its original release, &quot;Time Out&quot; is easily recognized as one of the most important albuns in the history of Jazz. Differently from seasonal music that fades with time, &quot;Time Out&quot;, like a great Cheteaux from Bordeaux, is getting even better, giving more and more pleasure in listening to it.
B00005B7CK|5.0|One of the most enjoyable movies I've seen - funny, uplifting, thought-provoking.  But, you must have familiarity with The Odyssey, and DEFINITELY have an understanding of the Depression-era rural south, and southern culture in general, in order to appreciate the rich and subtle substance of the film.  If you don't, watching this movie is a poor use of your time.  In direct contradiction to comments from some who apparently fail to meet these criteria: the music is simply marvelous (again, if you enjoy the harmonies and lyrics of bluegrass and folk music), the dialogue (particulary Clooney's part) is witty, and the stereotypes (and allusions to other films) are both necessary and delicious, and clever as well. This is most certainly not a racist film and the point is NOT the 'plot'. Yes, there are a few rough spots and historical inaccuracies. But, they are trivial. This movie is an testament to the talent of the Coens, and far better than Fargo, which had a dark and bizarre side!
B000002NCW|5.0|Another strong 90's album from Mike Oldfield. This highly Celtic-influenced set is a must own for any fan of Mike's. We get a better example of his guitar virtuosity here than perhaps on any other album. From soft, deft New Age-esque acoustic guitar work to his stinging electric work that is often likened to David Gilmour, Oldfield here shows that he is one of the instrument's foremost composers. However, there are, of course, quite a few other instruments used here. From keyboards to pipes to traditional Celtic instruments, it's all here. Divided between crafty originals and new takes on traditional pieces, Voyager is a very good Mike Oldfield album that is perhaps one of his most underrated. Beautiful melodies and interesting progressions ensue throughout, making this an essential album for any true Oldfield fan.
B000002O51|3.0|To make it brief:<br />Amanda is OK. How this is Boston's only number one hit is beyond me. Probably just goes to show that ballads get more airplay on more stations. I can skip &quot;The Launch&quot; (it's not even really a song!), &quot;My Destination&quot;, &quot;A New World&quot;, and &quot;To Be a Man&quot;. That's three and half tracks worth that I think are essentially wasted.<br />The other real problem with this album is that it never sounds like Scholz is playing with a real band. Compare the drumming on this with Sib's from the first one, and you'll conclude that there's a whole artistic component missing. Not to mention that the drums sound like they're in some sort of sound-absorbing box.<br />&quot;Third Stage&quot; is another one of those albums where I get the impression a talented group didn't get enough outside input on song selection. Note to aspiring bands: Write constantly and throw out half the stuff. Keep the best.
B00004YW6I|4.0|i HAVE A LOT TO SAY ABOUT PJ HARVEy'S STORIES FROM THE CITY, STORIES FROM THE SEA. What a great title. Cities are like the sea. They are just there. And then any stories from them could be a portrait in time of a great moment in the life of, say an ant- as valuable as in the life of the Governor of that city, if not more. PJ picks out those instances, those star fish as she digs into the ocean, hands it to us and they're forever with us....she uses references to The City -   New York, of course, with such lyrical ease. For example: On a rooftop in Brooklyn/One in the morning/Watching the lights flash/in Manhattan...and then at some point she says&quot;the Empire State Buildiiing&quot; in a highly romantic urban(the only romantic way there is)lyrical tone.<br />The first song is about being in motion, having a protrusion even though you were'nt born with one and about having a pistol!( it's perfectly OK for PJ to demand one...shewill handle it better than anyone who claims they can)...and it's about love....&quot;i'm immortal when i'm with you&quot;<br />She used to question &quot;is this desire?&quot; but she's sure this time around of what i think may be a slightly more memorable feeling.  &quot;this is love, this is love...that(she's)feelin&quot;.<br />And of course, my favorite song of the album is &quot;You Said Something&quot;. She never tells us WHAT it was that &quot;you&quot; said but that &quot;it was very important&quot;. It's a beautiful scene from when two lovers standing on rooftops in NY are in love at one in the morning. This song is a scene of a feeling that she's created using the imagery and the romance of the city and never needing to say what exatly was it that her lover said.<br />The rock guitar backdrop is like no other i've heard in a long time. Powerful enough for her statement and sophisticated and fresh as anything.
0782008364|2.0|The movie was mildly sexy and a bit clever, but overall I found it to be cliched and pat. The last line of the movie, which epitomized the tone of comformity that existed throughout the movie to be a &quot;good dyke&quot; was frustratingly corny and an insult to my intelligence. I mean, please!
6303027016|5.0|Robin Williams gives his best performance as Adrian Kronauer, the manic Vietnam DJ, managing to blend riotous humor, tenderness, and believability into the real-life character he portrays.  I don't know if Kronauer is really like this--but, based on Williams' other performances in real-life roles (Patch Adams comes to mind) I think he is pretty close.  If I had been serving in Vietnam, risking my life on a daily basis, I would rather listen to the Stones or CCR and have someone like Kronauer/Williams to listen to than all the other pap the government served up at that time (Lawrence Welk, the McGuire Sisters, etal.)!<br />Thanks for allowing me the space and time to air my personal views.<br />Maura Meyer
B00002Z88D|5.0|This is absolutely amazing!  No Leaf Clover is probably one of my favorite songs ever and -Human is also good.  Both new songs hint at the older syle Metallica and the solo in Clover in agreement with a fellow reviewer sounds a lot like something Pre-Load.  I loved Master Of Puppets, Load, and the other non-album tracks (Clover, Human, I Disappear), so it just keeps me longing for the next album (which they're in the studio making right now!)  This is simply amazing and it is a must have for a fan of practically ANY musical genre.
6305558167|2.0|I own this DVD only because it was given to me for Christmas.  I myself would never buy it.  When I first saw Excalibur back in the 80's, I thought it was rather boring.  Today I don't think it is as much boring as it is dark and dull.  The acting is pretty bad and any of the characters are likable.  Arthur's voice annoys the heck out of me and the rest seem to be unhappy with their lives and always mad at each other. Merlin runs around and, like a broken record, does his magic with a single spell.  Speciall effects are very poor, too.  The scene where Uther, under Merlin's spell, rides his horse on the way to Tintagel Castle made me laugh.  He looked like riding on one of those &quot;quarter-horse-toys&quot; that can be found in a shopping mall. I gave Excalibur two stars because it is overall &quot;watchable&quot; and it does have a few good scenes.  However, I consider it as a one time event.
B000002H97|5.0|This is an album that really has it all.  It has the fast furious riffing that made Metallica famous, but it adds something new to the mix, an actual heartfelt ballad called &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot; Here's a rundown of all of the tracks:<br />1. Enter Sandman-4/5, Probably the definitive Metallica song and by that I meant that it's the most recognizable and most accessible.  It has a very good chorus and mean main riff.  The only reason it gets 4 instead of 5 is because the song is overall simplistic compared to the others on this album.<br />2. Sad But True-4/5, This is another classic.  It is a bit slowed down but just as mean as the rest of them.  It gets a tad repetitive though, but a great song nontheless.  The chorus is great.<br />3. Holier Than Thou-5/5, I just love this song.  It's fast, heavy and the vocals are awesome.  This is a nice fun song that attacks that music industry (somthing a lot of people don't know about this song)<br />4. The Unforgiven-5/5, WOW.  This song is very intense.  It starts off with an absolutely amazing acoustic riff.  The song has a lot of feeling.<br />5. Wherever I May Roam-5/5, Not much to say about this except that it's a very good song and it's quite atmospheric as well.<br />6. Don't Tread On Me-4/5, This sucker is heavy, but it isn't quite classic by Metallica's standards.  It has good lyrical meaning but the main riff sounds a lot like &quot;For Whom The Bell Tolls&quot; (Ride The Lightning).<br />7.Throught The Never-4/5, Fast, furious, and heavy, but the lyrics aren't too memorable.<br />8. Nothing Else Matters-5/5, Simply amazing.  James proves that he can sing on this song!<br />9. Of Wolf And Man-5/5, Amazing main riff and great drums.  the vocals are INTENSE!<br />10. The God That Failed-5/5, A very personal song for James Hetfield about his mother who died of cancer when he was a teenager.  It is a very heavy, ugly song, and is quite amazing.<br />11. My Friend Of Misery-4/5, Not one of the best on this album, but it's great nontheless. I love the bass intro and the vocals.<br />12. The Struggle Within-4/5, This is very fast and the vocals are brutal, good way to end this killer album.
B00003CX8J|3.0|No, this movie isn't a triumph of art. But it's very nice. The casting isn't perfect, either. Halle Berry is a cream puff, she doesn't have the amazon looks of the real Ororo Munro/Storm. Same for Anna Paquin -- she's no woman, just a little runny-nosed girl, which is very disappointing. But then again, the story involves her earliest introduction to the X-Men organization.<br />What does make the movie is everyone's favorite bad boy, Wolverine. Hugh Jackman steals the show in his movie debut, but what do you expect from a stage actor -- the man can act. You don't doubt him for a second. His story is very interesting too.<br />The depiction of the X-Men school is great. So is the depiction of Magneto, Sabretooth, and did I mention Wolverine? He's the MAN. You'll notice the pace of the movie accelerates towards the end, but otherwise it's a good flick.
B00003CX5P|4.0|So it wasn't the best film ever! Were we all really expecting it to be? We've all grown up with Star Wars (hell, it's been on TV every year since about 1985!), IMHO we should look at this new film as part 1 of 6 ...<br />Why was the technology better? Well lets look at the ancient civilisations like the Myans and the Egyptians and then look at where they are now ... Civilisations fall, looks like that could be what's about to happen in the Star Wars universe does it not?<br />The whole Metaclorin thing ... Makes perfect sense, the civilsation fell and when old techology was found no-one knew how it worked ... it became &quot;magic&quot;. No doubt in the years after Jedi this sort of knowledge could be recovered.<br />Jar Jar. Ok, I'll give you Jar Jar (although you probably wouldn't want to take him!) ...<br />In short, if you are looking to hate the film you will find no end of reasons to, if you want to love the film then it doesn't matter what people say you'll love it. Make up your own minds, don't listen to any of the robots here ...
6304994540|4.0|I loved this movie the first time I watched it. This is a sleeper if ever there was one. It is about a lazy man, the Dude, whose name is Lebowski. Of course, everyone calls him Dude.<br />At times the movie gently rolls over you like a warm lover in bed, it also dishes out a lot of hard-hitting strife and conflict. By giving you a taste of the Dude's laid back attitude and juxtaposing it with an increasingly harrowing series of events, the movie really creates a visceral experience for the viewer. But despite everything the Dude goes through, he comes out alright in the end.<br />What helps ease the suspense are a series of long, slow motion musical interludes. They use scenes from the Dude's dreams as well as his favorite pastime, bowling. I loved every single one.<br />The narration is so good, there just isn't enough. Also, you watch the movie and have a chance to solve the mystery yourself, as the Dude eventually does. There's plenty of depth to explore in the meantime though. And lots of laughs.<br />Not every scene is perfect -- sometimes the dialogue feels more like a slap in the face. But much of the movie is that much more gratifying and on the whole, it is a pretty cohesive work. The Big Lebowski loses out the most on replay value though, which is why it only gets a 4.. and maybe should only be 3.5. But don't deny yourself seeing this movie at least once. Okay?
B00005J73X|4.0|The CD is great. The only drawback is that they play their old songs (ie Living on a Prayer) when they were older. I was expecting them to sound the same as when they were younger. It's still good but not like the good ol days. It's worth buying if your a fan.
B000002J20|4.0|Other Yes albums contain the songs Yes fans most love to hear (&quot;Siberian Khatru&quot;, &quot;Gates of Delirium&quot;, &quot;Starship Trooper&quot;, &quot;Wonderous Stories&quot;, &quot;And You and I&quot;, &quot;Awaken&quot;, etc...), but this album remains the most interesting to me. After over 20 years, I still love listening to most of their music, but as a 34 year old man, I am most intrigued and challenged by &quot;Topographic Oceans&quot;. I think it was too &quot;difficult&quot; for me to grasp as a teenager, and has only come to reveal itself to me fully after having developed more sophisticated musical ears and a longer attention span. Sure, a lot of it is pretentious, but much of it is daring and beautiful. The two most fully realized songs are &quot;The Revealing Science of God&quot; and &quot;Ritual&quot;, and even these songs sound a bit &quot;pieced together&quot; in spots. My personal favorite, however, is &quot;The Ancient&quot;. The percusion and soaring slide-guitar intro is disorienting and troubling. The tumultuos &quot;thwak&quot; that punctuates the middle section throws the &quot;pretty&quot; sections off balance. The instrumental section at the end of the &quot;rock portion&quot; of the song is more chaotic than the comparable section of &quot;Gates of Delirium&quot;, and then the song ends with a folkish melody delivered with only acoustic guitar and vocals. Man, this is just a freakishly beautiful recording, and one can only be thankful that the bald-heads at Atlantic let the band release this music commercially.  <br />Spend a day listening to the Bartok string quartets, &quot;Tales from Topographic Oceans&quot;, Charles Mingus &quot;Antibes&quot;, Schumann's &quot;Dichterliebe&quot;, and finish up with the Beatles' song, &quot;Hey, Bulldog&quot;.
B000002I25|5.0|One good thing about 60's bands was their diversity of songs on one album. As an example, on this cd we have the Doors recording ballads, power rock, blues, and opera in a style that at times sounds otherworldly. In a documentary of the director Ed Wood, there was a quote that said every time you watch Plan 9 From Outer Space, that no matter what time of day or night you watched it at, it always seemed like 3am. The same can be said of this cd. When you listen to it, you  get a sense of twilight and sunset. You could say in some ways that Morrison was the founder or rediscoverer of gothic imagery in music.  Most of these songs, except \\"I Looked at You\\" and \\"Take It as it Comes\\", sound like no other songs being written during that era of flower power and smile on your brother puke. Even the averageness of \\"Take it as it Comes\\" is raised by its daring innuendo. \\"Break on Through\\" is one of the greatest moments of rock. \\"The Crystal Ship\\" is one of the most beautiful, almost like a 20th century lullaby. Also on hand is the horror driven song of death, \\"End of the Night\\" which sets the stage for the epic \\"The End\\", a song about murder and rebirth and casting away of old personas. This is one of the greatest cds of all time, and amazingly, was probably bettered by their second, Strange Days.
B000007S5B|2.0|Five to one seems to be the ratio of bad songs to good on this, the Doors third cd. Most of Morrison's best songs had been packed on to the first two cds, The Doors and Strange Days, which are both masterpieces. As compared to what came before, Waiting for the Sun is muddy sounding and unimaginative. Really, the only decent songs are &quot;Hello, I Love You&quot; and &quot;Love Street&quot;. But even these are average. The most interesting song is &quot;Not to Touch the Earth&quot; which was taken from a longer song cycle called The Celebration of the Lizard. For some reason only one song of this cycle was recorded on this cd. It can be found in its entirety on The Doors In Concert double cd set which I highly recommend. The inclusion of a studio recording of this work would have pushed the bad songs off and Waiting would have been if not good, then a really good cd. The Doors were yet to sink lower on The Soft Parade. But don't despair, the bounced back on their next one, Morrison Hotel.
B000002HH2|5.0|Bjork is the most original music artist of all time.  This is her best album, plain and simple. Every song is unique in it's own way (as are all of Bjorks' songs) and deserve repeated listining's.  From the industrial sounding 'Army of Me' to the trance inducing 'Headphones' there isn't a bad song on this album.  If you are new to Bjork's music, you can't go wrong with this one.  If you are already a fan, WHAT THE HECK IS WRONG WITH YOU!! Buy this cd.
078322933X|4.0|I knew as soon as I heard about his film that i'd like it. It is a tale of obsession that turns into a deadly game. A couple who seem so happy...then one day things turn sour...he can't let go of her!! He plunges her and her family into terror. Both Mark Wahlberg and Reese Witherspoon play the parts with true belief in their motives. An overall thrilling movie from beginning to end!! Don't miss this movie!!

B00002MZ4W|4.0|Who cares if there's a word in the title for every pound that she weighs! She is one of the most talented, soulful, and downright awesome musicians we've got going for us right now. The tracks on this CD run the gamut from angry, agitated, kinetic (&quot;On The Bound&quot;, &quot;A Mistake&quot;, &quot;Limp&quot;) to eerily light-hearted (&quot;Paper Bag&quot;). It offers a foray into several different styles of music, and lyrics that will set you up and bring you back down. I think she's really on to something here, and my only complaint, other than people's pointless response to the creative title, is that she hasn't put out more CDs, but I know that her kind of masterpieces takes longer to produce than simply &quot;sampling&quot; other artists' work. Don't miss this one!
B000059QY2|5.0|Vi este DVD en Espaa y me dio muchsimo placer.  Los cantantes son de la primera clase, y se destacan Wixell, Pavarotti y Gruberova.  Para los que no conocen bien la magia de la pera, les recomiendo este DVD para llegar a conocerla--la historia de Rigoletto es buena e interestante, contiene mucha accin, y no es una obra tan larga.

B00005BJPO|5.0|Ahh, Akira on DVD the wait is over. One of the greatest sci-fi films of all time is back. Akira has a complex plot, beautiful animation and a great score. If you haven't watched Akira your missing out on a great film, but it's not for everyone. If your anime taste rests on pointless violence and T&amp;A Akira is not for you.
B000002HPV|5.0|Well...what can I say? This is like, incredible. I've never heard anything like it. Cool. Only Bjork can create music like this.

If you like good music, buy this as soon as possible!!!!
B00003CXP1|5.0|Absoloutly must see.  Arguably this is one of the most powerful pieces of cinema ever created. I would recomend this film to people of all ages. I know many people would say that is irresponible but hey this movie is about the truth behind not just drug addiction but about addiction in general. What make this movie so powerful is the amazing performance of Ellen Burstyn. Had she been omitted the story would of taken on a fantastical element, similar to Trainspotting. Jared Leto gives and amazing performance as does Jennifer Connely and Marlon Wayons. It is inspiring to see such a young director take on such an ambitious project and then succed in handling it brilliantly. I was not at all surprised to find out that Hollywood wanted no part of this film. Everything from the cinematogrpahy to the original score is an inspired work of art. And ofcourse hats of to the brilliant James Chindlund.
B00005BJ2O|1.0|After I saw this movie I dashed out to buy the CD to hold me off until I can buy the DVD. What blew me away was the great original soundtrack by Craig Armstrong, especially the ending credit music... I was appalled to find out that not only was that not on the CD, but the original actors were not singing on most of it and were instead featuring well known music stars which was Extremely Disappointing. How can you call a soundtrack original if it doesn't play the music featured in the actual movie? <br />This also happened on Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet soundtrack. I don't buy the CD because what's her name or what's his face is singing on it, I buy it because the music, with the original actors, moved me in the movie--so I can listen to it and feel what I felt in the movie. <br />Although I LOVE David Bowie, I wanted to hear John Leguizamo sing the &quot;Nature Boy&quot; which is very key to the whole movie. Even the &quot;Hindi Sad Diamonds&quot; is different from the movie. And they put an old record filter on Nicole's voice when she sings the &quot;Sparkling Diamonds&quot; intro which changes the mood from how it was in the movie. ! This type of &quot;creative license&quot; is actually detrimental to the integrity of the true cut of the film. <br />I feel cheated...I am not sure why they are doing this or who is making these nonsensical decisions. I even wrote to Interscope of which they never replied. Don't people listen to what the customer's want anymore? It's just like how on TV nowadays they squash the ending credits on a movie with advertising together so you can't enjoy a proper closure--what's the point because you can't even see the credits anymore? It destroys the end of the movie and no one seems to care that it feels improper anymore. I don't like being force fed, hell I've been out of diapers for many many years now. Are you listening out there you big dudes in the Business out there?<br />But I digress...<br />I loved the ending credit music from Moulin Rouge so much I was thinking of recording it on a tape snuck in the theatre but it's probably illegal or something. Grrr!
630460288X|4.0|The movie is kind of bad. The plot is really stupid. Many important personages were not well developed. There were not even good actions. But, what the hell! I watched the movie several times and I have really enjoyed it. Why? Because Sylvester Stallone and Sandra Bullock just saved this stupid film from crash. Her sweet way and nice smile actually transformed this movie from substandard to great. Stallone's acting and humor was terrific. Thus, this movie is really worth watching. Watch how Bullock said to Stallone quite innocently: &quot;Would you like to have a sex?&quot; Wow! You should see it yourself!
078401115X|5.0|I love this movie for so many reasons. This of course is one of the last great perfomances given by Mickey Rourke. However Robert De Niro's cameo appearances are fantastic as well. The detail of this movie is lost on a viewer the first time through. It takes several viewings to truly take Angel Heart in. But that is the genius of this film. It can be watched over and over again. Each time connecting a few more dots in what turns out to be an all together brilliant movie.
B00003CXRM|4.0|If you liked &quot;Raising Arizona&quot; or &quot;Until the end of the World&quot; you will love this movie. This is a story revolving around the characters in it.
B00001SIES|5.0|For anyone anywhere put off by the idea that MUSE are like RADIOHEAD, then honestly, they are NOT. Any UK fans will know that MUSE are tired of hearing this comparrison. Their songs are far more original. Inspired by the composer 'Berlioz', Matt brings out incredible piano intros, like that of 'sunburn', &amp; choruses explode with powerful riffs, such as that of ' Fillip' &amp; muscle museum. Other sadder songs like 'unintended' are beautifuly crafted , with simple guitar in the background. Anyone who likes My Vitriol, JJ72, IDLEWILD or NiRVANA, will love this, &amp; if YOU like this then the new album 'origin of symmetry' will blow you away... Especially 'NEW BORN'. If you get the chance to see MUSE live then do. You will remember it FOREVER.
6304007523|5.0|I have an original VHS of the movie RockyI from 1986. I recently bought the 25th Anniversary edition. Having seen Rocky I over 100 times I have the dialogue almost memorized The dialogue in the 25th anniversary edition has been doctored. In the opening scene after the fight with Spider Reko in the locker room Spider Reko says &quot;You were lucky tonight&quot; in the original version he makes mention of Rocky's hard punches.    On the dock when Rocky collects from some loser named Bob in the original Bob stutters about taping up the thumb to make it look like Rocky broke it as Rocky had been ordered to do. In the 25th anniversary edition he does not stutter and the words &quot;No one will be the wiser &quot; have been added. For the first part of the movie I got the impression that it was the TBS version. The rest of the movie is like the original
B00005A1PR|5.0|India sings from her soul. I have listened to this CD just about every day since I purchased it.  There is a song on this CD that mirrors whatever mood I'm in.  The songs are both acoustic and soulful. The track &quot;Video&quot; should be an inspiration to every girl and woman, how can you not love the lyrics? Not only should women love this album for the hit &quot;Video&quot; but so many of the songs echo the life experiences of just about any woman.  If you're thinking about escaping, &quot;Beautiful&quot; is the song for you.  If you're looking for love, listen to &quot;I Ready for Love&quot;.  Other great songs are Back to the Middle, Promises, Brown Skin, and Always in My Head.  The lyrics to these songs are simply poetic.  Her style is not traditional soul, but her delivery is smooth.  India is a new soul artist who has her own style and should be around for years.
B00005LMBK|5.0|I love Dan the Automator and Del's past work believe me this project lives upto it, no doubt. Damon, on some of the tracks, takes the vocals up to sounding like the Kinks early works. I just wanted this album to keep going on, add b-sides to it. My only complaint is that on the enhanced part of the disc. Why didn't the producers include the video for Clint Eastwood???? The disc is a classic....
B00003CXAT|4.0|When a rich entrapreneur finances a bold experiment, and succeeds in the cloning of Dinosaurs, he needs the authorization of a few experts and critics to ok his new attraction after a fatal accident occurs.  However, during the tour, a Tropical Storm hits the secluded island of Isla Nublar, and all hell breaks loose....and that pretty much sums up one of the greatest movies ever to grace the silver screen.  It was only a matter of time before the release of the Special Edition DVD.<br />Usually when you see the words 'Special Edition' you can look forward to Deleted Scenes, Outtakes and behind the scenes documentaries.  Well, unfortunately, there really isn't much anything 'special' about this.   Don't get me wrong, the quality of the movie is outstanding.  I have never seen the movie in such great sound and picture quality before.  There are a few 'making of' documentaries and other related things. There are also a few trailers.  However, there is some footage that is still missing from the movie, footage that was NOT cut in the theatrical release, but was cut in the transition to home video.  Now on DVD you would expect some of these scenes back.  That is not the case. There really isnt much making the DVD 'special' other than its incredibly high quality and behind the scenes documentaries.  There are also some fun facts about the Dinosaurs on the island, but it still feels like there could have been more.  All in all, a very good DVD, a must own for fans of the movie.
0783240503|5.0|I could watch this movie over and over again! All the songs are so catchy and Donny Osmond makes a great Joseph (he has a really nice voice). Andrew Lloyd Webber is a famous name in musicals, and I think this is one of my favorites.
B00003CXHJ|2.0|This film credits American sailors with the daring capture of the Nazi code machine,the Enigma, an event that changed the course of the war. In fact, the Brits seized Enigma before America had even joined the war. this shows us that it is just another movie that was made so that they could get big bucks. in 1942, the U.S. Navy had a minimal role in the Battle of the Atlantic.Also around this time U-Boats were ranging up and down the largely undefended American coastline, sinking hundreds of ships in the process. The defeat of the U-Boats was largely the result of years of struggle and effort by the Royal Navy and at the very least, the film should have made mention of the role played by the British in defeating the U-Boats. Instead, the film tells viewers that, until the timely arrival of the heroic Americans, the Germans largely had their way with the British. In another scene, the German crew of the U-571 brutally machine guns a lifeboat full of survivors from a presumably torpedoed merchant ship. Overriding the objections of the crew, the captain tells his men that it was &quot;the Fuhrer's order&quot; to kill all survivors of shipwrecks. this was done to make the Germans look even worse than they were.
B00005KFUM|4.0|You may or you may not like the music Muse make, but you can't simply ignore it. At least not now. Although 'Showbiz', their debut, had an astonishingly good music coming from so young musicians, it didn't get the thumbs up you'd expect. The only reason mentioned: they're copycats. Well, it can't be denied that at times they really sounded a lot like Radiohead, but even it is so, is it a good enough reason to disregard music with that quality? The winds have changed. Radiohead have gone their way and Muse evolved into something you may even fear of. Introduced by the rather one-faced but tricky single 'Plug-In Baby', this album is really something close to a space opera. It is loud and atmospheric and it constantly morphes into something you didn't expect, led by one of the most original frontmen in the moment, Bellamy. That's about it. Don't want to be fun-spoiler. Cheers!
B000005RFQ|5.0|well, let's start by saying that Sabbath never had and will never have anything as powerful on vocals as Ian Gillan. So why did this album fail? Very simple: because Gillan and Iommi are two different schools. When you combine Deep Purple with Black Sabbath, chances are that the result will be more of a confusion than success. <br />While Gillan's voice is unmatched, this is certainly the most un-Sabbath record. Hell, it's even odd listening to Gillan screaming about witches and satans. I guess, a perfect lineup may not necessarily imply a perfect record.
B000059HAI|5.0|This film is about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour in December of 1941.  It is not about anything else - there is no love story!  It is told from the perspective of the leaders of both sides, including the PM of Japan, the military leaders (Marshall, Yamamoto, etc.), and the senior diplomats (including the US embassy in Tokyo, and the Japanese in Washington).  The first 80-90 minutes tells of the lead-up to the battle, showing Japanese pilots practising, diplomatic/political meetings, setting up radar stations in Hawaii, etc.  The final 40-50 minutes is a recreation of the battle.  Of significance is the attention to detail.  The uniforms, ships, and planes all look very nice.  In addition (as the director's commentary points out), all the events depicted in the movie are well documented as having really happened, from eyewitness reports, ships' logs, etc.<br />The most impressive part is, of course, the battle itself.  It looks amazing!  Especially when compared with modern movies ; why don't computer effects obey the laws of physics?  Bombs do not fall straight down, they follow parabolic tragectories.  Because all the effects are &quot;real&quot; in this movie (i.e. full-scale models), the battle has a sense of realism that modern movies do not duplicate.  Further, there are frequent cuts to dumbfounded officers watching the carnage, which, instead of slowing the action down, make the action scenes more poignant.<br />Modern movies have a disturbing tendency to gloss over (or change outright) facts for the purposes of the story.  Here, everything is in context - WWII did not start with this event, which other movies often imply by ignoring the broader picture.  A second modern tendency is to tell the story from a swabby's or PFC's perspective, which will necessarily limit the character's scope of knowledge.  Instead, Tora, Tora, Tora tells all from the brass and civilian leaders' perspective, so you get more of the subtlties.  Finally, showing both the Japanese and US perspective makes for a much better look at this battle.<br />The DVD extras are not great, but the director's commentary (also featuring a Japanese film historian) has some interesting tidbits.  For anyone unfamiliar with the battle, the 20 minute documentary will be helpful, although the identities of the men interviewed are not released, which gives it an air of amaturism.  Incidentally, the name &quot;Tora, Tora, Tora&quot; comes from the code word signalled by the Japanese pilots to indicate that complete surprise was achieved in the attack.
4789004546|5.0|Want to learn to speak proper Japanese? If you said \\"yes\\" then you MUST have this book! It is as simple as that. It is not a textbook, but this book goes into much more depth then most other Japanese learning material on the market. It assumes you have a grasp of the rudimentary basics and gives you the necessary foundation needed for proficiency. Each entry gives in-depth explainations, examples, it explains common mistakes students make when using certain grammar points, and also refers you to similar pharses. It can be used as a reference tool, or just flip through it at random and study new ways to express yourself.
B00005B6N7|2.0|This is another of those &quot;Americans did everything in the war&quot; and &quot;American Hero&quot; Movies. In This movie the Americans went ahead and said that they did all the work in capturing the ENIGMA Machine, when in fact, the English did, even before the Americans even joined the war. Another historical fact, The real U571 was sunk off Ireland, by good old Aussies. Now to get onto the actual Movie.  The movie was actually very boring, people in other reviews are talking about good &quot;special effects&quot;, when it is all just good pyrotechnics. Not a good movie, don't see it, it should get a 1, but it bumped to 2 because of lots of explosions.
B00003CXN4|4.0|This was an excellent movie, probably better than the one that one the Oscar (Gladiator). Great performances, direction and a great script. Unfortunately, the DVD was bare-bones, with only a very short feature. They may come out with a special (&quot;untimate,&quot; &quot;transcendent&quot; or whatever they will be calling them that month) edition one day, so I would wait awhile before buying. I'd definitely rent it though, because it is a very entertaining film.
B00004STPT|5.0|I am a 14 year old who loved the movie and decided to get the soundtrack. I love it. The battle and now we are free are the best. But I was reviewing the reviews and found a women named Gretchen C. Elsner. She gave it 1 star! She thought it was a bad cd and said not to buy it. I think something is wrong with her head to say that this cd was a bad one.
B00005HYH9|5.0|This album is a beautiful Pink Floyd album, but it is definately not a starter album.  Tracks like &quot;Wots...uh the deal&quot; and &quot;Childhood's End&quot; are quite simply Pink Floyd at their best.  This is an album and true fan should own, and an album that is a must for anyone who enjoys the albums More, Meddle, or Atom Heart Mother.
B00005ASOC|5.0|Before I rented this movie, I was skeptical as to my interest level.  But after a bit of coercion from my wife I consented an rented it.  Half way through the movie I was captivated by the beautiful story line and the supurb acting.     The movie is set in the Bronx, NY.  The setting is typical New York urban developments; children playing, tall buildings and much traffic.  The movie begins with a few young men playing basketball on an outside court.  Their attention is diverted to a window at the top of a, moderately tall, apartment building.  Here, William Forrester - Sean Connery, sits and watches the urbanesque view below.  Through acts of inmature jesting, the paths of Jamal , Rob Brown, and Sean Connery meet.  This meeting will invoke a symbiotic relationship where the two men discover their need for each other - filling an empty void within their souls.      This movie has all of the emotions that humans can understand.  You will remember this movie not just as an entertaining story, but also as a life lesson that we each can learn from.
B0000025ZF|4.0|This album is not about a man cheating on his wife, it is a story of a dream plain and simple.  It is a fantastic sensory journey that Waters drags each listener (who actually gets it) through from start to finish.  I love this album because it plays tricks on your mind just as each of our own nightmares, and eventually we awake to find that they were only our imagination.  Waters is an amazing lyracist, and has composed a brilliant concept on this album.  I personally rank this album much higher to his later released Amused to Death.
B00005BJ2O|3.0|I bought this CD the day after seeing the movie.  While this is a music review and not a movie review, you have to relate the two.  You basically have to see the movie to appreciate the music and understand some of the songs.  In any case, Ewan McGregor missed his calling as a singer.  If acting doesn't work out (yeah, right!!), he could certainly make a living with his voice.  Every time he opened his mouth to sing, my heart literally took a leap.  (His lucky wife!!!)  In my opinion, the best songs on the CD are those done by Ewan and Nicole (she has a great voice too, by the way).  The mixture of songs done in &quot;Elephant Love Medley&quot; (once again, you have to see the movie to understand about the elephant) is creative and interesting, to say the least.  Their duet, &quot;Come What May&quot;, could well be a wedding song we hear a lot in the future, and I hope to hear it on radio.  Sappy, cheesy, whatever some may call this, it's still quite a good love song and ties in well with the theme of the movie (their &quot;secret song&quot;).  Like many others have voiced, the inclusion of the remake for &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; should have been replaced by the combination of tunes used in the movie for one of the opening scenes (Can-can, Nirvana's &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;, etc.).  Also enjoyable is the take on Sting's &quot;Roxanne&quot;, appropriately fitted to the &quot;women&quot; in the movie, if you happen to know what the song is about.  Frankly, I would have liked to have heard more from Ewan (ok, Nicole too!!).  A point to make is that he definitely does NOT need backup, as demonstrated on what I thought would be his solo effort, Elton John's &quot;Your Song&quot;, where he's joined by opera singer Alessandro Safina.  Ewan's WAY better than Elton John, forgive me if I offend.  While this compilation includes more songs from the movie than some soundtracks do, I, like countless others, wonder why songs NOT from the movie are included.  Give usthe movie music, please, and ALL of it!!
B00003CXRM|3.0|First of all, the movie deserves 3-1/2 stars.  This movie might be the highest example of having the potential to be one of the greatest films ever made, but falling short of the mark.  The movie is one of the best: acted, filmed and soundtracked I have ever seen; HOWEVER, the screenplay is sometimes confusing as well as paced rather poorly throughtout the film.  It is definitely entertaining, but I would rent it once before buying it.
B00004TJLD|3.0|Alan Parson's I Robot is a milestone recording that reached many inovations in the music industry. The DVD version could have been better, in stereo mode the recording is unsurpassed it's everything you would expect and more. However in the 6 channel mode the sound is flat and for the money it is a bit disappointing, in addition I could not get it to play in Dolby Digital 5.1?? I rated this a 3 stars because for [the money] I would have expected more for the money and certainly more for this outstanding recording. Sorry folks if you already have the CD keep it, if you don't then buy the DVD audio.
B000002HPT|5.0|My first one was A Change of Seasons, which I discovered when I was in 9th grade.  A year later I bought this one and fell in love with one of the greatest discs ever.  Why?  &quot;New Millenium&quot; starts it heavy with plenty of crunch and time changes.  &quot;You Not Me&quot; is a more steady, (I hate to say commercial but it was more radio friendly) even rocker that doesn't go off on too much of a tangent, but is solid.  &quot;Hollow Years&quot; and &quot;Take Away My Pain&quot; are gorgeous ballads in and of themselves, and the closer &quot;Trial of Tears&quot; is just amazing.  But my highlight of the CD is the trilogy of &quot;Burning My Soul,&quot; &quot;Hell's Kitchen,&quot; and &quot;Lines in the Sand&quot; (They should've made all three just one track in my humble opinion.).  Burning My Soul is straight forward metal with a badass Derek Sherinnian keyboard solo that just wails.  After all that thrash, we get into the moody &quot;Hell's Kitchen,&quot; which has to be one of the most beautiful, melodic, and technically astounding instrumentals I've ever heard.  The middle to end is awesome especially when Petrucci, Myung, and Sherinnian go off on a run from hell, playing the same melodic lines on their respective instruments, at full speed just blowing one away.  And &quot;Lines in the Sand&quot; gives us tempo changes, great vocals (Ty Tabor of Kings X with James LaBrie!)  and one of John Petrucci's most melodic, and most powerful guitar solos of all time.  <br />A lot of people downplay this disc when comparing it to others, but DT themselves stated they went more for a songwriting approach on this one as opposed to being very technical.  What do you get?  A more open Dream Theater.  A little restrained yes, but not bad.  This still stands as one of my favorite discs I've ever picked up.  It shows that Dream Theater can do everything with music.  They can be technical, melodic, idiosyncratic, and very open and laid back.  Most importantly, it shows they've matured to know when to hold back just a little bit, and to know when to give us everything they've got.  If they hadn't done this album like this, would Metropolis 2 be as great as it is?  I don't think so.
1563890119|4.0|Gaiman's incredible Sandman series starts with this collection. While trying to capture the personification of Death (a tried and true fantasy convention) a magician captures instead the King of Dreams, who remains his prisoner for seven decades until he (Dream) is finally given an opportunity to escape. Comic book conventions come into play at the beginning with guest appearances by John Constantine and Etrigan as Dream pursues his lost tools of office. But when Dream finally confronts the man,(a minor DC villain,Dr. Destiny)who possesses the last of these tools the series enters a different realm far from the typical comic book. Taking his lead from Alan Moore's work on Swamp Thing, Gaiman creates an atmosphere of real horror as Dr. Destiny warps the lives of a few unlucky diner patrons, driving them to madness before he is finally stopped by Dream. It is in the scenes at the diner Gamain's talent really comes to the forefront and you realize that this is no typical comic book experience. By showing the gradual destruction of these characters Gaiman give the reader a peak at what becomes the theme of the entire series; the power of dreams in our lives.
B00004XQP4|5.0|Green Day is definately the best modern band around.They have the  most ceative lyrics and instruments.They ARE very impertinent,  which is probably one reason I like them so much.Billie Joe is a great baritone singer,Mike Dirnt is a good bass player, and the  drummer is always doing something different.&quot;Misery&quot; is a great song,the opposite of what anybody is doing these days.&quot;Minority&quot; has a great message,a message that more songs should have,rather than all that pop crap about how &quot;baby I dont/do want you back.&quot; This is such a great cd I give all the songs on it 5 stars. AND FOR ONCE AND FOR ALL,GREENDAYISNT ANYTHING LIKE BLINK 182!!!
014100018X|4.0|Chocolat is a modern fairy tale in which an unmarried chocolate maker and her daughter run afoul the local parish priest when they move into a small French town to set up shop. While the tale is not a highly original one, Joanne Harris excels at creating an atmosphere of mystery and magic and peoples her novel with characters the reader can readily identify with. Her descriptions of this small town and its many denizens make for a delightful read. The conventional plot is told in an unconventional manner, with just enough twists and turns to keep anyone occupied and entertained.
B00003CXHJ|1.0|u-571 is a story about some yanks on a submarine who try to capture the enigma code which is the german navel code during the second world war. This statement that is made by the movie is verry in corect and the americans did not realy even have anything to do with its capture. The british were firstly the ppl who captured it and they had done it beefor the americans had alread begun. In u-571 they also portray the germans to be evil when they were not. by history student at shore school
0375501851|2.0|As wtih many of the other reviewers, I wanted very much to like this book.  A few good friends had told me how much they enjoyed it, but about half way into the book, I had to wonder if I was reading the same book they had.  The characters were interesting and well developed, but I found parts of the plot to be unrealistic.  The ending was particularly poorly conceived - abrupt and nonsensical.  Overall, I was glad to be finished it.  I am hopeful that the author's next effort is better crafted.
B000001E7V|5.0|I saw tricky live in hollywood last week and he gave a fantastic show.  He played four songs on this album and most of the rest on his new album blowback.  I have to say that Tricky is reinventing his career and is emerging as one of most daring artists to ever coming out of the underground music scene.  He is so amazing cuz he doesn't sound like anyone else and his style is so unique no one can really match him or even criticize his artwork which is very angst driven and often very sexual.  Songs like Overcome, Pumpkin and Abbaon Fat Track are very sensual and soothing almost like a sexual trip into an unknown world of darkness and mysteria.  Martine's voice is angelic and beautiful.  Mixed with Tricky's painful lyrics and devilish vocals her contribution makes the album sound ethereal and listenable all the way thorough.  Unfortunately,  Martine is no longer singing in Tricky's albums but his new singer Ambersunshower sounds just as sweet.  I listened to her sing the news songs on the new album at the concert i went to and i was blown away by the intensity and the uniqueness of her voice.  The new album is so good it will be the next best thing to come out of trip hop since maxinquaye's debut.
B00005KFUM|4.0|As I am writing this I have this wicked CD on repeat on my stereo and each time I hear it I become a little more acquainted with parts I never recognised. A little more complex and in depth then their debut, Origin of Symmetry is a sophomore effort which defies the much anticipated second-album convention of bathos which has plagued many a less worthy act. The sometimes demonic, sometimes seductive bass-lines, the complex layered guitar and synth and most importantly the soaring operatic vocals of Matt Bellamy make this a must-have for the discerning progressive rock fan.<br />This is very probably what radiohead might sound like if they had taken the guitar rock path and started listening to a smidgeon of tool or angst-ridden punk rock. Experimental, progressive and almost always brilliant, Muse excel. The second single, New Born, makes a rip roaring opener which contains one of the most charged guitar riffs ever penned once the band has dispensed with the pleasantries of the piano driven intro. The second song - and obvious third single - Bliss shows a lovely blend of guitar and synth effects to show off a side of muse which didn't emerge fully on the debut but was always hinted at. The song rocks. Full stop. Hyper Music says all that needs to be said in its appellation, and is just a little funky - which is weird given the angry/morose lyrics, but still very cool.<br />If you're reading this you have no doubt heard plug in baby, and as a guitarist I tell you that's what it makes me want to do everytime. Just plug in and rock out, the riff is incendiary and the bass line ...is just awesome. Unfortunately, the rest of the album doesn't quite meet the high expectations Muse generate in the first five tracks. Don't get me wrong, there is some great stuff in there...but experimentation and complexities seem to run away from the normally blistering three-piece. However, the second half is what makes this an album and guarantees you won't be bored by it. Don't be surprised if you end up drawing your favourite track from amongst these after spending a little more time getting acquatined with it. <br />It is great, and if I hadn't been so quick to review it a little more time would probably have earned it five stars. ...the fact that someone is still rocking out, trashing instruments and making something new of a tired medium is all that's left. Grab it.
0783243499|5.0|an insightful and hysterical dark comedy that demonstrates what happens to our psyches when we live in an environment of lies, greed and superficiality.  the setting in this case is wall street, but wall street is really a metaphor for modern society at large.  the main character at first, acting on impulse, starts knocking off the &quot;worst of the worst&quot; of the over bearing, manipulative, pretentious creeps he encounters.  as his madness grows he loses sight of good and bad people and starts killing indiscriminately.  the main actor christian bale does a great job portraying the serial killer patrick bateman, in a stylish performane on par with richard gere's breakout role in &quot;american gigolo.&quot;  all this and a surprise ending that will keep you guessing and questioning after the movie has ended.
0375704027|5.0|If you want to read a meaningful story of hope versus despair, past versus present, love versus lust, read Haruki Murakami's Norwegian Wood. This is a cut above the normal love story - in fact it's more than just a love story (much more) - but you'll have to read it to find out why. Let's just put it this way... some books provide candyfloss entertainment and are easily forgotten, some books make an impression and keep jumping back at you. This belongs firmly in the second category.
B00004XOWM|1.0|When it comes to no-talent &quot;musicians&quot; who are just in it for the money, Limp Bizkit takes the cake.  I thought they couldn't sink much lower with &quot;Significant Other&quot;, but somehow they have managed to create an even worse album.  This has got to be one of the worst albums ever made.  I mean, really, can Wes Borland even play the guitar at all?  I'm not a guitarist, but I think that after about an hour of practicing chords, I could outplay him with ease.  Then there's Fred Durst.  He's gotta have one of the most irritating voices there is.  He can't rap at all.  I'm not really a fan of rap music anyway, but I know that someone like MC Overlord or LL Cool J could outrap him without even breaking a sweat.  If anyone in this band has any talent at all, it's the bass player, but he's still average at best.  And, the songs...&quot;Rollin&quot; and &quot;My Way&quot; are about as bad as a song can get.  &quot;Hot Dog&quot; is one of those &quot;let's-see-how-many-times-we-can-fit-the-f-word-into-one-recording&quot; kind of deals.  Pretty immature, actually.  &quot;The One&quot; is yet another lackluster hip-hop-ish ballad that is better than most of their stuff, but still not very good.  It all compiles into one awful package.  I'd list all the albums that you should buy over this one, but there is not nearly enough room.  If you want good rap metal, get Papa Roach's &quot;Infest&quot;, Faith No More's &quot;Real Thing&quot;, and Machine Head's &quot;Burning Red&quot;, but this is not even vaguely worth it.  Now, if you'll excuse me, I feel like getting in my car and &quot;rollin, rollin, rollin&quot; over a copy of this CD!
0684853523|5.0|I think anyone would enjoy this book, not just the aspiring writers that he's aiming at.  The autobiography portion is funny and touching and gives you an insight into the modest beginnings of one of America's most prolific fiction writers.  But what I love about this book is that he talks plainly about what he considers to be good writing, with actual instructions that are immensely helpful.  He answers questions that any new writer would ask.  How long should my book be?  How many words should I try to write each day?  What staples of writing instruction should I have at my dispoal?  His advice on 1st and 2nd drafts is very helpful and he even gives you his thoughts on sentence structure - the nuts and bolts of language!  This book has been invaluable to me, and I would recommend it overwhelmingly (please read the part about adverbs - very funny).  When it's time to produce the second draft of the book I'm currently working on, I know I'll go back and reread the passages I've underlined, if not reread the entire book.  Buy it, you won't regret it.  Along the same vein is Bird by Bird by Anne Lamott, another book for people who aren't yet confident enought to call themselves writers.
B00003CXP1|4.0|this movie should be used in a &quot;say no to drugs&quot; campaign for kids.it shows in an extremely unsettling manner how even the most minor usage of drugs for the strangest reasons can lead you into a complete downward spiral in no time at all.this movie really shows us how things can start off minorly messed up and end up in the worst situations possible.very scary.
B000001FY9|4.0|This is one magnificent album! Just about every Bob Marley song that got any popularity is included here. If you've ever wanted to get into reggae, but found the selection of albums and artists overwhelming, I would suggest you pick this one up. I only have a couple complaints about this album. One, the version of &quot;I Shot the Sherriff&quot; on here sounds horrible. Well, at least the Wailers do. Really off-key... they could have used any other version. Also, I was shocked that &quot;Smoke Two Joints&quot; was missing from this collection. Anyway, this is excellent chillin' music, and I highly reccomend it, especially to the calm ganja smokers! ;-)
0312979479|5.0|As an avid peruser of most Agatha Christie novels, I must state that this is one of the Queen of Crime's superb mysteries. Set on the mystical, deserted Indian Island, eight people are invited by an unknown host to stay at a house complete with a butler and and cook, Mr. and Mrs. Rogers, who are completely clueless of the identity of their employer. In each of the guests' bedrooms, there is a poem pinned up to the wall: and old nursery rhyme featuring ten little Indian boys. It is then that the murders begin, revealing that each guest (including Mr. and Mrs. Rogers) is concealing deep, deadly secrets connected to murder in their past (accidental or on purpose). Who the culprit is is the case which causes commotion and suspicision among the house's occupants and fright. But all is not lost since a pattern develops following the content of the poem. Soon only two people remain alive on the island, Philip Lombard and Vera Claythorne. Which one is the killer? The solution is quite a twist since both die anyway as predicted:  &quot;Two little Indian boys sitting in the sun;  One got frizzled up and then there was one.  One little Indian boy left all alone;  He went and hanged himself and then there were none.&quot; So get your hands on 'And Then There Were None'; it's grand fun and suspense and if you are that a great of a sleuth like Hercule Poirot, the solution is quite a clinch and erratic, yet highly expected of Agatha Christie.
B00005BJ2O|2.0|don't get me wrong, on its own this is a fine enough album. BUT, it's missing some of the best numbers in the film, and i'd much rather hear John Leguizamo sing &quot;nature boy&quot; (as he did in the film) instead of the faux-coolness of David Bowie. where is &quot;like a virgin?&quot; where is &quot;spectacular spectacular?&quot; and where is &quot;zidler's rap?&quot;  i hope they release a CD that plays ALL the music &amp; songs from the movie, in their proper order. meanwhile, this album only makes me hunger for the songs it's missing.
0061007137|4.0|The adventure begins when Adam Scott, a former captain enlisted in the army, has a yellowed envelope bestowed upon him in his father's will. To discover what its content is, he visits a Swiss bank with his girlfriend, Heidi, from clues in the letter placed in the envelope. Meanwhile trouble brews in Russia due to a painting called &quot;the Czar's icon&quot; of Saint George and the dragon among Russian agents of the KGB.It seems that the painting, which has been lost for 15 years, contains a concealed document that marks a compromise between the United States and the Soviet Union that will be invalid in a few days (on June, 20,1966, to be exact). At the same moment, Adam discovers that the icon was the object bequethed to him, unaware of the dilemma in Russia. It is then when Heidi is kidnapped and murdered by Alex Romanov, leader of the search for the icon, that the Englishman realizes the Russians will do anything to retrieve the icon back. Running across Europe for his life and to reach England, he is pursued by agents of the CIA, the KGB, and his own countrymen. 'A Matter of Honor' is not only intriguing but conveys morals that everyone needs to grasp and the love of a son for his father we all comprehend. With its historical settings and characters (i.e., President Johnson), Jeffrey Archer's novel is sure to be a winner with most of us.
B000003TAB|5.0|This is a wonderful album. I listen to it 24/7. It's music is pure punk. Turnaround, Sun of a Gun, Aneurysm, Been a Son and Molly's Lips are great punk songs that are fun to sing along to. Big Long Now is a kind of depressing song that makes you think. Stain, Mexican Seafood, Hairspray Queen, Downer, and Aero Zeppelin has grungy, hardcore sounds to them, which makes them all the easier to listen to! Very enjoyable songs. This album is a must for ANY grunge/punk/Nirvana fan.
B000059XXZ|4.0|I might go as so far to say it is the only good Batman movie. There. I said it! This is the only good Batman movie. Burton's Batman does not have any of the cheesy cartoonish-ness of the later Batman films. His characteristic dark moodiness gives the first Batman an edgy hipness that the others definetly lack. This is not without humor, of course--Jack Nicholson makes a wonderfully perverse Joker. I also love Michael Keaton as the unlikely superhero. Kim Basinger is a little annoying as Vicki Vale but oh well, you can't have everything.
B00003CXN4|5.0|This movie was totally amazing and should be viewed by everyone.  I don't understand why so many people believed that this movie has no plot and was boring.  THese people just don't understand how important a movie like this is. Even though it plays like a documentary in some parts (especially the mexican american border scenes) it is an even better way of showing what a problem drugs have given the world. This movie also had great camera work (I'm a sucker for that)that definetly gave a gritty feel to mexico.  So don't listen to the one and two star reviews. This is a great movie and should have beaten the ... movie gladiator for best picture. SEE IT!
B00005JIZA|5.0|Very rarely does one buy a CD and enjoys every track they hear. Room for Squares plays like a Greatest Hits compilation. Never before have I heard such invigorating, haunting, passionate and beautifully imaginative melodies...especially from such a young, talented artist. My favorite tracks are &quot;Back to You&quot; &amp; &quot;Great Indoors&quot; with the remaining 10 tracks being tied for second place. I hope the gifted Mr. Mayer is welcomed by the lackluster play list of American radio. An artist of his magnitude and brilliance should be heard!
0451527712|5.0|I missed reading this book until a few years ago and found that the book blows away every movie ever done in the name of Frankenstein. The timeless questions of God and existence are handled beautifully and the emotional depth is vast and haunting.<br />If you like intelligent horror you'll love this one.
B000002BE9|5.0|Man! this album is a true classic,the first time when i heard about Fiona is when i heard the song 'Criminal' and imideately i was hooked.The album is full of grooves and deep lyrics,the kind of lyrics that goes straight to your heart like an arrow.My personal favourite is 'ShadowBoxer' its dark,jazzy and totaly elegant.Fiona's music reminds you of those seductive nights with candles and satin sheets and her words speaks like a confession.I cant find any other artist that can produced such an amazing album as this especially at her age when she recorded this album.Buy it you wont regret it, because once you put this album in the player,you will be transported to an elegant jazzy world of pure music.A true classic.
B00003CWTI|5.0|Ok, I'll be honest.  This is my third review of this movie but I have to counteract the 1 star reviews.  I KNOW I KNOW, their opinions are valid, but I don't think they are being honest.  Most of them praise several aspects of the movie (acting, art direction, etc.) but just slam the length.  If they like something about it, it must be worth more than 1 star.  This movie, whether you like it or not, is obviously better than a hollywood throwaway.  If these people were honest they would admit that they thought it was at least average.  1 stars should be reserved for the truly terrible movie without any redeemable qualities.  So anyway, i do love this movie, though I certainly wouldn't recommend it to most.  It is challenging.  It is art, it is not entertainment.  Most people only want entertainment so they do not like this movie.  Like all challenging art, when someone praises it, those who do not enjoy it feel insulted.  They feel they are being called stupid which isn't true.  The problem is that they are looking for the wrong things within the art.  So then they call the movie pretentious (how can a movie be pretentious? People can be pretentious but objects can't.)and say it draws attention to itself (what else should it do? Draw attention to your couch or shoelaces?). So anyway, I know I'm preaching to the choir here, but i cannot let people ruin this.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|The Beatles are, without question, the greatest pop band of all time. They influenced all of the musicians around them and all of the musicians yet to come. BUT THIS IS NOT THEIR GREATEST WORK!! Songs like &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;, &quot;She's Leaving Home&quot;, and &quot;She Came in Through the Bathroom Window&quot; all deserved to be at no.1 at some point, and it really gets to me that songs like &quot;Paperback Writer&quot; made it and these songs did not.      <br />     But do not get me wrong. The majority of these songs fully deserve to be on the &quot;Beatles 1&quot; cd.                  <br />     Bottom Line: Buy it, but be sure to pick up such titles as &quot;Abbey Road&quot;, and &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;.
B00003CXRP|4.0|Tom Hanks delivers another exceptional and emotional performance (Don't worry I'll back that up).  The film is not perfect, but it would be silly to expect it to be.  In the first act, you are introduced to Hanks' character, Chuck Noland, a Fed Ex engineer.  We are given the idea that he is planning to ask Helen Hunt to marry him (giving her an obvious gift) but he decides to wait until he returns from his trip.  He leaves for his plane exclaiming, &quot;I'll be right back!&quot;, but that doesn't happen.  His plane goes down and he (being the lone survivor) washes up on an island with nothing but his clothes, a load of Fed Ex packages that wash ashore, and an antique watch that Helen Hunt gave him just before he left.  The second act, where the only life you see for a while is Hanks (I don't even think you see a bird or anything else until that whale), is the most compelling and memorable part of the film.  His relationship with &quot;Wilson&quot; the volleyball is more believable than the one he has with Helen Hunt (there is also more chemistry between the two).  I feel more sympathy when he loses &quot;Wilson&quot; than we he finds Hunt married with children.  The ending is a little weird but what did everyone expect, after 4 years?  Hunt's character  single and waiting in front of her house for someone she attended a funeral for?  The most important part of the film concerns his determination to stay alive on that little island, not his relationship with Hunt (Which, by the way, could have been played by just about any actress).  I don't think that this is just having to endure Hunt in every other movie since &quot;Good as it gets&quot; talking either.  There just isn't much chemistry between the two. It is not uncommon for Hunt to lack chemistry with a male character or for there to be some confusion as to why the male is interested in the first place (see Dr. T, What Women Want, etc.).  I think she was cast due to her popularity in other films or maybe Hanks requested her.  Anyway, the film is worth seeing (owning actually) for Hanks' performance and for that little volley ball that took on a larger emotional significance than any other character in the film.
B00005BJ2O|3.0|I saw the movie first, and I was really hyped to see the soundtrack, as I loved most of the songs done in it.  <br />Then I saw the track listing. I loved all the music done by the actual CAST of the movie, that actually pertained to the PLOT, actually had something to do with the MOVIE. <br />Had the cd contained more of the cast's songs and less songs thrown in there, I would have given this cd as many stars as I could.  <br />Alas, it gets only three.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|I love this CD - I think Savage Garden has gotten even better with this second CD than their first attempt.  Their music is so meaningful and melodic - very well written.  I could listen (and have listened) to this over and over again without getting tired of it.  Also very easy to sing along with.  If you like to sing and you liked the first Savage Garden CD, you'll love this one!
630438551X|3.0|If/when a live genius elects to credit/blame a dead genius as part of the commercial naming of one of these projects, Baz Luhrmann might want to leave the nightengales/larks in place? Nevertheless, this intoxicating dramatic machine, Shakespeare's gift to the adolescent (in fact or dreams) in each of us, always WORKS, somehow, if any audience LIKES the human beings cast as leading star-crossed players. Claire Danes is a deeply attractive Juliet. Many can EITHER deliver the lines decently OR project sweet 14 graciously. Few can handle the mix as effectively as Ms. Danes. Leonardo seems functional enough as Romeo, though this judgement is best left to adolescent (&amp; older) women, who apparently enjoy the dude? One may wish for MUCH less simultaneous &amp;/or alternate speeding up &amp; dumbing down of the play, regret the careless/stupid excesses of the production, bemoan the harsh fact that yes this IS a fair example of the kind of vile punky gunslinging cinema that can assist a troubled youth into murderous temptation, all that. But it was ever thus, if slightly less brazenly/obviously in 1595? This is the Teenager in Love zone. Visit (or revisit) at your own risk.
0920668372|5.0|I think that people need to stop over-analyzing this book. It's just about a mother's love for her son. I don't think some of the ideas seem too logical. I mean, how can an old woman pick up a grown man. I think it's just symbolically saying that a mother's love for her child never ends.
B00004XOWM|4.0|.... ...don't buy this album expecting to hear great prose. From the first song, 'Hot Dog', in which Fred injects the f-word on just about every single line ('If I say f--- just two more times, that's 46 f---s in this f---ed up rhyme'), Limp Bizkit makes it clear that this album is all about energy. If you don't have a place to play this with the volume cranked up, don't bother. <br />'Full-Nelson' is an example of the high-energy Durst screaming similar to their debut with 'Faith'. 'Rollin', 'Getcha Groove On', and 'My Way' have some catchy beats and clever rhymes, and are probably worth listening to at normal volumes. My personal favorite song is 'Livin' It Up' - a tribute to the band's \\"life in the fast lane.\\" Most of the songs on the last half of the album seem to be there because they had to have enough songs to fill the album, though the 'Rollin' remix is pretty good with DMX and Method Man. <br />....
0451523938|5.0|Henry Jekyll is a renowned scientist and a respected man. But lately, his behavior has become strange, reclusive and mysterious. So his friend Utterson tries to find out what he's up to. In the meantime, terrible and strange things are happening by night in the streets of London. As the tale unfolds, we discover Jekyll's dangerous games with his own psyche. He discovers a drug that reveals his evil side, without any moral restraint, and gradually loses control of the drug. The narrative technique of Stevenson in this short masterpiece is simply perfect; its philosophical stand is frightening; its moral implications are relevant; and the construction of the story superb.<br />The onion-layer style serves very well its mission to reveal every event in a semi-slow but tense pace. The environment is insuperable: the dark, wet and gas-lighted streets of London, where Mr. Hyde's steps resonate frighteningly. The ending is horrifying and very well written and, overall, this is a gem of a book. It should be best read in loneliness, in the dark. It is much more than a simple horror novel, because it says something very real and very terrible: without moral restraints, our deeper self can be unbearably evil. It's true.
6304082428|5.0|This version of Pride and Prejudice is amazing! The scenes are gorgeus and you learn so much about every character that you feel you live in their time! Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy is wonderful! His early silence draws to him and his love for Elizabeth Bennet is so passionate and honest. Jennifer Ehle is every bit of Elizabeth Bennet as I imagined as I read the book. She is a superd actress and is full of personality. THe costumes of beautiful and so are the scenes of Pemberley. Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth are both so easy to look at on screen. They are becuatiful together and are a pleasure to watch. Pride and Prejudice is my favorite novel of all times, and I love the video so much! I have had it for 5 years now and I watch it every month still! I love this story and I always have dreamed of being Elizabeth Bennet and falling in love with the rich and hansom Mr. Darcy. The supporting cast is amazing too! Mrs. Bennet is funny and extravagant, and Mr. Bingley is a pleasure to watch. The Passion and excitement never go away in this movie, Though it is almost 6 hours long, The time just flies by. There is not one slow part in the whole movie.      This videois a great thing to watch before or after you had read Jane Austens novel Pride and Prejudice, and I'm sure after seeing this you'll want to read much more of Jane Austen's novels.I cannot describe to you how wonderful this movie is. YOU MUST BUY IT!
B00005JK93|5.0|I just got to see this film as part of a film festival, prior to its national release, and it is fantastic!  Like both &quot;Rocky Horror&quot; and &quot;Tommy,&quot; it is filled with over-the-top excess, great original rock songs, and interesting characters--esp. Hedwig/Handel her/himself.  We learn about Hedwig, a refugee from the former East Berlin, via a series of flashbacks, often during performances of Hedwig's &quot;internationally unknown&quot; band, The Angry Inch, as it continues its national tour of low-rent seafood restaurants, always near where famous rock star Tommy Gnosis is playing (but don't say she is stalking him, even if he did steal all her songs and broke her heart).  The ending is unexpected yet satisfying, as Hedwig comes to understand the origin of love.  Filled with witty dialogue, biting song lyrics (including new songs just for the film), and unique visual imagery, &quot;Hedwig and the Angry Inch&quot; is a must-see tour-de-force that already has a cult following (thanks to the success of the off-Broadway show and the success of the film at Sundance).  I can't wait to get the soundtrack, and eventually the video/DVD!
B000005KQT|5.0|If you are into blues and blues harmonica,this is it. A real deal bluesman who lived the life(see fabulous biographical insert). Part of Muddy Waters band and the electric &quot;revolution.&quot;  Feel the raw power from his newly developed crunchy, eery back alley, plugged in amplifier sound. Hear the beginnings of modern electric rock &amp; roll. His voice even sounds harplike. Waters and his bandmate Jimmy Rogers play on some tracks,as well as Willie Dixon, Bo Diddly and Otis Spann.  From his famous #1 R&amp;B hit  instrumental &quot;Juke&quot; to the well known &quot;Boom, Boom out go the lights&quot; every track is a winner. Many tracks recognizable as modern bands have covered some of these.  One of my desert island picks.
B000059TCE|4.0|I'm still not completely sold on the 'necessity' of the live-action 101 Dalmations, but in deference to millions of other Disney fans, I'll admit the first romp with Glenn Close was nicely done.  Like anyone old enough to remember seeing the animated version as a kid, I had a few melancholy moments watching the remake, noticing bits that had been updated or altered to make the story more contempo.<br />Making Cruella (or more precisely, Glenn Close) the star of the remake suited Disney and moviegoers just fine, but I think her casting tips the balance of the story toward spectacle.  The improved animation with CGI tips it even further, although it's hard to fault the production for using the best modern tech.  I guess it's all part and parcel of trying to make a twentysomething film palatable to a modern audience.  In my opinion, the original film has less visual dazzle but a lot more character as a whole.<br />As for buying this twofer instead of just one of the films...it's completely a matter of personal tastes.  If Glenn Close was one of your biggest reasons for enjoying 101 Dalmations, the sequel is probably a must-view.  The movie is almost entirely hers, as Cruella is given the lion's share of characterization and screen time.  The supporting cast is affably anonymous, with the exception of Gerard Depardieu, who must have sold his soul to Disney to get stuck in such an apalling role.  (Gratuitous humiliation: Gerard's Van Pelt winds up face-first in a toilet.)  If you found yourself slightly disappointed by aspects of the 101 remake (like the fact that the dogs didn't talk any more), the sequel isn't likely to improve your opinion (even though you'll get a talking cockatiel with the voice of Monty Python's Terry Gilliam).<br />This DVD set has the usual Disney extras, at least for modern releases, so you can expect subtitles, some &quot;making of&quot; docu-footage and (drumroll please)... a garsh-honest DELETED SCENE from 102.  (In it, Cruella is released from prison...but don't blink 'cause it's a short segment.)  Put these bonuses together with the features and you have, IMO, a little four star bundle of entertainment to enjoy.  (My personal rating for this package is about 3 stars, but I've adjusted my final rating to reflect the belief that most young kids will love these films in all their live-action spectacle.)<br />Jom prison...but don't blink 'cause it's a short segment.)

0783117523|5.0|This is it folks - a genuine \\"breakout performance\\". We don't get them often enough so we should pay attention when we do.<br />WARNING ::: This review reveals some plot points !<br />\\"Gia\\", a film for HBO, stars Angelina Jolie, Faye Dunaway, Elizabeth Mitchell and Mercedes Ruehl.<br />This film is the life-story of Gia Carangi, one of the first \\"supermodels\\". How big a star/model was Gia? Well, Cindy Crawford was dubbed the \\"young Gia\\" and the \\"next Gia\\" - that's how famous she was.<br />Unfortunately, besides being the \\"face\\" of the day in the modelling world, she was also fairly famous for her drug addiction and ultimate fall from grace.<br />If you want a more indepth depiction of Gia's life - there are a couple of books available. The best being \\"Thing of Beauty: The Tragedy of Supermodel Gia\\".<br />Back to the film.<br />Angelina Jolie BECOMES Gia in every sense of the word. Her performance is one of the best portrayals of real people in years. She is completely and utter believable. She captures what is surely the essense of Gia. She brings a desparate wanting to the character that you can feel.<br />Elizabeth Mitchell ( recently of \\"ER\\" fame ) co-stars and really provides an excellent touch-stone for Gia's tortured existance.<br />There's nothing pretty about this film - it shows the whole story, the drugs, the parties, the sex, the pain and the suffering. It depicts, with little filter, the USING of Gia and her decent into her fate.<br />It's no surprise that Angelina won a Golden Globe for this amazing performance. It's no surprise that she was nominated for an Emmy either. You're not able to take your eyes off her. As a matter of fact, this is a much awarded film - including a best actress award for Angelina Jolie at the LA Outfest.<br />Faye Dunaway is mainly here for star power - almost as if they weren't sure Angelina Jolie could pull it off. She's okay here, but we all know that Faye has done some amazing work and here, she sort of phones it in.<br />Mercedes Ruehl plays Gia's mother and she does a good job. She's a little over the top but you suspect it's an accurate portrayal.<br />For the Angelina Jolie fan - it's a MUST SEE, MUST OWN film. For others, it really is worth the time and money.<br />You don't often get a chance to see a young star make an amazing film like this. You'll see small tales of \\"Lisa\\" from her Academy Award winning performance in \\"Girl, Interupted\\" in Gia, but mostly you'll see an INCREDIBLE performance by Angelina Jolie. Really remarkable.<br />FYI : There is an UNRATED version available on VHS that is currently not available on DVD. The UNRATED version contains more explict scenes ( specifically the shower sequence is longer ).<br />In all, a great film. Well written, directed and acted. A real gem. Thank you HBO.<br />All The Best, turtlexbr />Mercedes Ruehl plays Gia's mother and she does a good job.

B000059Z8J|2.0|Okay-- let's face it, &quot;Superman&quot; is not the best, and certainly not the most consistent, franchise in movie history.  The second film in the series, &quot;Superman II&quot;, is a classic comic book movie-- superior in every way, shape, and form to the original.  How rare is that??<br />This first Superduperman is too LONG!!  It is also very short on STORY.  All the stuff on Krypton with Superman's parents, the baby Superman's voyage to Earth, the teenage Superman-- all this stuff could have been told so much quicker.  The early scenes with Clark Kent and Margot Kidder at the Daily Planet are cute, but beyond that, there isn't much going on in this movie.  Lex Luthor wants to blow up the California coast, Superduperman has to stop it.  And the ending??  Well, I don't want to spoil anything for people who haven't seen it, but suffice it to say that I don't believe anyone can literally turn back the clock.<br />As for the DVD, yes its a lavish package (the screen tests are particularly fun).  But there are better movies that deserve this deluxe treatment far more.  Richard Donner is a good director, but I bet he's had bowel movements more interesting than this overall bland film.  Rent part II and save yourself the gas pains.
B000002HPV|4.0|I've just recently discovered Bjork's music after seeing and hearing her stunning performance in Dancer in the Dark and its soundtrack, and have since listened to all her solo discs, and seem to now on a regular basis. This one is my favorite. Debut and Post are both wonderful discs, but on this disc she has found the perfect balance between electronic and acoustic backdrops (combining ambient beats with gorgeous string-based melodies) and created her most truly focused recording. The entire album is a supremely melodic showcase of her songwriting, experimentation and incomparable voice. The disc minus &quot;Pluto&quot; - which I find rather grating - is five star quality (explaining the four stars - 4 3/4 would be more accurate). The highlights for me are &quot;Joga&quot;, &quot;Unravel&quot;, &quot;Bachelorette&quot; and &quot;5 Years&quot; which are absolutely beautiful - lyrically and musically. The disc is basically an orchestral feast for the ears. I look forward to her upcoming Vespertine disc, which hopefully is a continuation of the brilliance she displays here.
014028009X|3.0|At the beginning of this novel I was surprisingly pleased with the funny way she spoke of the insecurities that plague allmost all women in this day and age.  We all have the fat day, the too many drinks day, the hate all men and wish they would all spontainously combust day etc.  I found myself laughing out loud at certian points relating to the character.  But, then about half way through I started to get quite annoyed.  I mean her largest weight, once translated from stones to pounds, is like 130lbs, and then the book started to wear on me like a friend that constantly complains ablout her weight searching for you to tell her, no hon you look great. I became bothered by the fact that this women could not find anything about herself too be happy about, that she could not find any measure of peace alone and that only in finding of a man would her life be fulfilled.  By the end of the book I felt that she had become a character that bothered me, so I couldn't root for her, instead I felt like grabbing her and yelling, &quot;suck it up for gods sake&quot;!!
0380973650|5.0|I simply could not put this book down. I just read for 48 hours. With this work, Neil takes his already considerable talents from the comic spaces and delivers his first full length novel. It works brilliantly. He tackles big ideas in this novel and it works well. I have never read any of Neil's other work but was quickly drawn into this one. The story (on the surface) involves a Shadow Moon, serving three years in prision. He is sprung a few days early only to learn that his wife has been killed in an acident. He meets a strange character on the plane to the funeral, named Wednesday. He offers Shadow a job and with nothing to lose he accepts. But he finds that working for Wednesday is not at all what it seams.<br />The two embarg on a wild road trip across the country where Shadow is introduced to a whole host of really interesting and fascinating characters, who turn out to be old Gods, stuck here in America, forgotten. They all seem to know more about Shadow than he does himself.<br />This is also where the book takes on a wonderful additional quality. On one hand, a large part of the book conveys a wonderful description of back-roads middle America and small towns and the people that populate them. There are great descriptions of roadside attractions.<br />All along, Shadow constantly hears that &quot;a storm is coming.&quot; It soon becomes clear that the storm is nothing less than a war between the old Gods who followed their faithful believers from Europe and the new Gods of the 20th Century: the god of the TV, the god of the Internet. There is a very bizare and fully scene with the god of television, taking the form of Lucy Ricardo. Neil's talents at keeping this all together are formidable.<br />In short, this is brilliant. With this work, Neil moves from the top ranks of comic book narative writers into a new realm where he shows us that can create his own myths and deliver a as a full fledged novel writer.
B00003CXRM|5.0|This movie is pure entertainment, if you'll just let it be!  Don't try to overlay 'The Odyssey', as it won't fit line by line.  Enjoy the subtle references and the music.  This movie is like a beautiful drive through the country, while the radio plays all your favorite old harmonies.   Scenes are astounding, the acting is superb (Nelson's Delmar is hilarious) - 'Oh George, not the livestock' - and the music comprises one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard.  Buy this movie!
6304712936|5.0|F. Murray Abraham proves in this film that he is not a good actor. F. Murray Abraham proves that he is, in fact, one of the best. His portrayal of Antonio Salieri is unprecedented in its believability and gives credence to the fact that Mr. Abraham is indeed one of the best actors of our generation. Tom Hulce's performance is also impeccable: He actually *becomes* Mozart. Even after having seen dozens of pictures of the real Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, I still picture Tom Hulce in my head when I hear Mozart's name.  <br />This ideal combination of acting talent makes for one of the best films ever produced - its eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture, are all well deserved. It is undoubtedly one of my favorite films of all time (if not my very favorite), and the DVD-quality picture and sound (as if Mozart's music wasn't fantastic enough already) make it all the more enjoyable. Don't get up from your computer without purchasing this masterpiece.
B0000524E5|5.0|The strengths of this DVD are : 1) A nice storyline which shows how a country girl tries to survive in NY. 2) Nice music eg. Can't fight the moonlight, etc. throughout the show. 3) Girl-Appeal esp. the innocence of Piper Perabo and the sensuality of the coyotes. 4) Romance with a nice ending :) 5) various commentaries on the movie 6) music video of 'can't fight the moonlight'
B000002IZ4|5.0|&quot;Fine place for a day full of breakdowns&quot; yells Scott Weiland against 'Meat Plow's ear-filling riff in STP's sophomore album. One of the strongest (and most overlooked) songs on the album, it is a thundering, original fresh blast of air, despite what all the critics say about STP ripping off (admittedly superior) bands like Nirvana and Pearl Jam. It is followed by 'Vasoline', which is over before you really get a feel for it. The saving grace of 'Lounge Fly' is its mellow, acoustic midsection which is far more affecting than the louder riffery of its first half. 'Interstate Love Song' and 'Still Remains' are two different views of love, both featuring memorable riffs. Weiland's chorus line &quot;if you should die before me ask if you could bring a friend&quot; are the most affecting lyrics on the album. 'Pretty Penny' and 'Big Empty' are slower tracks that grow on you, but neither is a standout. 'Unglued' and 'Army Ants' are both saved by their choruses and cool guitar riffs. 'Kitchenware &amp; Candybars' is unusual, but a decent closer. The secret track, '12 Gracious Melodies', is so ridiculous and overdone you can't help but love it. After a few listens you'll never get it out of your head. However, best of all these songs is 'Silvergun Superman', an edgy, longish (by STP's standards) epic with unique song structure and striking, whispered verses. Overall this album breaks free from the mold of other similar music. It may not rock quite as hard as Nirvana or have the realistic, personal lyrics of Pearl Jam, but it makes up for it with its melodic and fun rock music.
B00004Y6TQ|5.0|I had heard about DANCER IN THE DARK for sometime but could not get my head around the idea of Bjork.  I was wrong.  DANCER IN THE DARK is a fantastic movie, probably one of the year's best.  And SELMASONGS is a beautiful compilation of the music from the movie.  Bjork is one the most overrated performers out there today and her voice is so unique and magical that it's a crime to not listen to her.  Even though there are only seven tracks, it doesn't matter.  Most CD's have only one of two good songs on it anyway.<br />This CD takes you back to what emotions and feelings you experienced while watching the movie.  It's a fantastic buy and I also recommend to buy the DVD of DANCER IN THE DARK.  It's a real movie about the human soul.  A movie with depth, heart, and a well conceived plot.
B000000W6F|5.0|Billy Corgan has described 'Gish' as a &quot;religious album, not in a God way, but in personal way.&quot; Although this may not make much sense at first, songs like 'I Am One', 'Rhinoceros', and 'Snail' confirm this somehow. Their bizarre, almost otherwordly melodies are a pleasure to listen to. Other standout tracks include 'Siva', 'Bury Me', and 'Tristessa' and the fleeting beauty of the strange 'Daydream'. This unsettling but enjoyable ode to Corgan's personality is nowhere near as technically and musically perfect as later albums such as 'Siamese Dream' and 'Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness', but it has a depth and feeling that was somehow missing. Plus, none of the later albums had a song so personal, so gut-wrenching and beautiful and strange and indescribable, as 'Snail'...
0312954468|5.0|I completely enjoyed reading this book! I have read it over and over even though I usually do not enjoy re-reading novels! It is my favorite book so far and I am so anxious to start Warlock! My only complaint is that I cannot make the book a reality and live it! This was truly a work of art!
6305161879|2.0|This gut-busting comedy starring Kevin Kline, Jamie Lee Curtis, John Cleese and Michael Palin deserves better.  The DVD has the worst sound I've ever experienced on DVD or VHS.  If you're used to 5.1 sound, mono just doesn't cut it.  It's one of my favorite comedies, and maybe my most disappointing DVD.
0871137380|5.0|If you have cause to listen to this book in its audio format, you will not be disappointed. The presentation, which starts a bit gung ho, will keep you entranced for the duration. I sat in the garage listening, long after the engine had gone cold. This story never does.
0440219078|5.0|I have to say that I'm not a person that really reads a lot.  I never have time too.  I picked up this book before I fell asleep assuming that I'd just put it down not long after. Boy was I wrong.  I stayed up all night long reading this book and had it finished by morning!  The book really hooks you and makes you keep reading!  I recommend this book to everyone!!!  I have read it so many times and I still am not sick of it!  Try it!
0783227272|4.0|I applaud &quot;Amistad&quot;'s decision to tell its story from the point of view of the Africans.  We see the United States, and the local politics, through their eyes -- chilly, contradictory, and often downright silly.  Not enough can be said about Djimon Hounsou's screen presence.  He dominates the film's opening and closing shots, and the overwhelming majority of the rest of the scenes.<br />The rest of the cast is a glorious assemblage.  Dozens of veteran character actors are almost shoehorned into the piece, tripping over each other to steal the show.  Arliss Howard, Austin Pendleton, and Harry Groener are all lurking in the background, for those who pay attention.  The big-name stars, the faces on the movie poster, are also a draw:  Anthony Hopkins, again playing a US President, is dazzling.  Pete Postlethwaite fortunately gets ample time to strut his craft as the leering District Attorney.<br />I'm a little puzzled by the courtroom scenes, most notably the lengthy oral argument Hopkins gives before the Supreme Court.  Granted, this film takes place in 1839, but the Court doesn't interrupt Hopkins once -- not a single question!  Retired Justice Harry Blackmun appears on the bench, although he doesn't say a word.<br />Matthew McConaughey plays the standard Spielbergian lawyer.  Unlike the poor fellow in &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, the attorney Baldwin is given time to grow and develop - but he's still played by Matthew McConaughey, so the character perhaps lacks some of the realism he so richly deserved.  He says less in thousands of words than Postlethwaite does with one tilt of the head.<br />There's a lot in &quot;Amistad&quot; to appeal to moviegoers of all stripes.   I don't think the movie was meant to be as powerful as &quot;Schindler&quot; -- the American politics are too one-dimensional, the political machinations almost done for laughs -- but for the most part it's a symphony of filmmaking and a movie to be seen more than just once.
0783225857|5.0|There is nothing about this movie I dislike.  Gregory Peck is brilliant and so are all the other actors and actresses.  How about the filming, directing, writing, plot, casting?  Well, &quot;As good as it gets&quot; would be a suitable way of how I rate this movie compared to all others.
0067575315|5.0|As a designer this book has one of the richest layouts Ive ever seen in a book of its genera. As a fan, you cant find a more complete collection of visuals and concepts about the animated series in one volume. Now, if they would only do the same with Batman Beyond. Hint Hint.
B00005B36H|5.0|Well, now that I have had some time to really listen to this I'll write up my thoughts.<br />This is an incredible piece of art. I've been listening to Tool for over 8 years now, and not here and there, pretty much constantly. Especially for Opiate and Aenima. Undertow is great, but my least favorite album.<br />On May 14th &amp; 15th I was up all night in anticipation, but I managed to get to the nearest cd store at 8 am and buy my copy. When I got home and put the disc in my cd player I did not know what to expect, nor had I brooded about it over and over all night. I just cleared my mind and pressed play. I was so shocked that I could finally relax enough to fall asleep. This is in no way a bad indication. As soon as I woke up I jammed the play button of course.<br />Everytime I listen to this album it sounds different. That's a quality I cannot say any other artist has accomplished. Tool are just a group of geniuses who make absolute masterpieces when they go into the studio. For anyone who is a Tool fan, I recommend this on the highest tier. For people who are sorta new to Tool, or just liked their singles, I say pick it up anyway. You're bound to like something it has to offer. I have two copies for when the first one wears down as did Aenima and Opiate. Not a bad idea for my fellow hardcore Tool fans.<br />Final summation; classic.
B00003CXMG|5.0|By the end of watching 'Almost Famous' I felt really cheated. By cheated I mean that I wish I could have lived at that time. It seemed like such an era of real emotion and adventure. Today's commercial world that shows in the music and in the additudes of society makes me feel like something was taken away from me.   By the description above you can tell I really connected with this movie. That's because when I watched it I never saw Patrick Fugit or Billy Crudup or Kate Hudson. I saw William Miller, Russell Hammond, and Penny Lane. It was just so real to me I felt like I was there watching William's life as if I was sitting next to him. I guess it's because the script was based on Crowe's real life and he did actually live the story. Along with the great actors who put themselves into the characters. The realism was unlike anything I've ever seen, it was like watching a documentary but a whole lot more enjoyable. This movie made me see what I missed.    On a different subject I think one actor in this movie who was also a little cheated. His name is Michael Angarano and he played the 11 year old version of William Miller and even though he was only in the movie for the first 8 minuted of dialogue, I thought he was really great. Mike added to the real emotion as well as the older and more well-known actors but nobody in the Amazon.com reviews for this movie recognized that and I would like to be the first.
0553274503|5.0|Flowers for Algernon, an early Hugo winner, has long been considered a science fiction classic.  However, the main theme of the storey is not science fiction.  It is a tragically moving tale written in a style similar to Gogol's Diary of a Madman.  The sad feeling impressed upon the reader is too strong and real.  The ending is so painful it will make you regret having read it.
B000002ULO|4.0|I really enjoyed much of this album.    A few of the songs such as &quot;If You Wanna&quot;, &quot;Used To Be GBad&quot; and &quot;Really Love You&quot; seemed like throw away songs.  However, &quot;Beautiful Night&quot;, &quot;Souvenir&quot;, &quot;Heaven On A Sunday&quot; and &quot;Somedays&quot; are really good.  All though maybe a little over-produced at times.  &quot;Flaming Pie&quot; is a fun song to listen to.  I think Paul would have had better look reaching and adult contemporary audience by releasing songs like &quot;Souvenir&quot; etc... as singles instead of the light pop of &quot;Young Boy&quot; and &quot;The World Tonight.&quot;
1558216847|4.0|I truly wished that I could believe this was a true story. Somewhere buried inside this tale is a lot of truth. Certainly the horrors of WWII and the Soviet gulags are all  terribly true enough.<br />There is just too much to take.   I did a search to try to  corroborate this story and could find nothing anywhere that interviews the other members or corroborates this in any way.<br />I hope that they do make a movie out of this story since that will force enough attention to try to verify this story one way or the other.<br />I can only hope that it is corroborated and the &quot;real&quot; story is the victim of an overzealous and not very competent ghost writer.
0446364495|1.0|I don't mean to sound insensitive, but if this book were a horse, I'd have to shoot it.  No, really; it's that bad.  I don't know a single English professor who ever read it.  It was smarmy and pretentious.  When I read the line about a &quot;star creature on a comet's tail&quot;, I was groaning out loud.  And when I read &quot;I am the highway and a peregrine and all the sails that ever went to sea&quot;, I found myself hoping that those sails would be capsized by a hurricane.  And the part where Francesca's children read about her lovemaking really creeped me out.<br />&quot;Yes, kids, nothing says healthy like reading about your mother's adulterous sexual escapades.&quot;<br />Overall, despite its hype, this is nothing we haven't seen before.  You read one romance novel, you've read 'em all.  Kind of like Stephen King novels.  If you're truly curious, pick it up at the library.  You'l laugh until you realize that it's not a comedy.
0671027344|5.0|'The Perks of Being a Wallflower,' a book that anyone can relate to. Chbsoky writes from the perspective of a young, confused teenager. I started reading this book at 10:00 pm and didn't put it down until 1:00 am. I laughed at Charlie's sense of humor and I cried at his sensitivity to the world. In a time when all is crazy and doesn't make sense it is a comfort to me to read something that reminds me I am not the only one experiencing these feelings I have.
B00000DLVA|3.0|As brilliant as this album is, I can't help but note the Portishead(who I also love) in almost every song. I love Nina's voice, it's hard not to feel like you're being wrapped in a blanket with her vocals, but I was hoping for more of the Sixty-ish happy tunes, like Tomorrow from Life or Lovefool from FBOTM.<br />Turning to darker music with depressing lyrics has just made them like a lot of other bands. Almost every song you hear on the radio today is depressing in some way. I'm not saying they're bad songs, and I'm not saying the songs on this album are bad, but I miss the happy summer tunes that make you feel good about the world.  That's how the Cardigans started out; why couldn't they have stuck to that?<br />But anyways, pick up this album because it's still great, but don't expect it to be like Life. And if anyone gets offended by my review, I'm sorry; this is just my opinion. I still think the Cardigans are great.
B000002LK1|5.0|I've owned this album (both the tape and the CD) since it came out over a decade ago.  Many people have said that this is their favorite DM album, and I will agree with them.  So why do so many people like Violator?  I think the main reason is that EVERY song on the album is very solid.  I own about every other Depeche Mode album, and, while I like all of them, I can say that most of them have one track that I just don't like as much as the others.  I stress the fact that it is only one or maybe two tracks, because DM have made nothing but solid albums since the beginning, a feat that very few artists can also claim (consider also the fact that they've been around for 20+ years).  Back to Violator.  Violator is a little faster as a whole than the more recent albums (Exciter and Ultra for example), and maybe a little more catchy.  It's easy to see why songs such as Personal Jesus, Enjoy the Silence, and Policy of Truth went on to have such a success.  The other songs are excellent as well (I'm a big fan of Sweetest Perfection and Clean).<br />I'm sure you've read enough.  Let me just rephrase everything I've said in the past paragraph: If you've ever heard anything from DM and liked it, I would say with certainty that you will also like Violator
B00004Y6OA|5.0|From front to back, this is a jewel of an album that all VH(or rock fans in general) should own!  This is Van Halen's first all-original record.  No covers here(not that cover tunes are bad).  They do sound a little more seasoned, but they still haven't forgotten how to have fun(They don't until around 5150 or OU812...gee, I wonder why. =P ).  <br />Although Eddie's guitar playing isn't quite as firey as in VH1 or Fair Warning(my personal fav.), it still smokes!<br />There are no fillers on this album; every tune is of top-notch quality--something that we don't see enough of these days.   Oh, and Dave is Dave, of course!  It doesn't get much better than this, folks!<br />Check this Mutha out!!
B000001FI7|5.0|This is the ultimate 'Bristol Sound'.  Beth Gibbons vocals blow you away from start to finish.  Their ability to be soulful and unimposing is outstanding, and the perfect compliment to the music itself.  The tracks are easy to listen to and memorable.  One of the best CD's in my collection...
6304806418|5.0|Evita is an absolutely wonderful spectacle to behold.  Andrew Lloyd Webber's music is, as always, fantastic, contemporary, and (a very good feature) completely addictive.  See Evita once, and you must see it again, memorize the words, dye your hair blonde, and practice singing to low E.  I love Andrew Lloyd Webber's music--he tests the limits of the human voice, and makes it interesting with vocal extremes (SQUEAK to RUMBLE).  However, Andrew also gives all of us girls a break from having to take the high parts all the time, and usually writes most of his girls pretty low, and all of his guys in the VERY HIGH (For a male) range.        Madonna was great!!!  She gives hope to all of those altos out there!  In a way, Evita's story reflects her own, because Madonna didn't exactly start out on top, and neither did Evita.  Both women had the qualities of acting like celebrities before they achieved stardom.  Also, I have heard (because I have not seen the stage version yet) that Evita was played with a more manipulative edge in the stage version.  I have read parts of Evita's biography, and her true personality was not like that.  Madonna becomes Evita perfectly by playing her more sincerely, which is more fitting to the real Eva Peron.      I had no idea that Antonio Banderas could sing as well as he does.  His style of singing does not lead you to believe that the songs are very hard at all, and that anybody can do it.  (When you actually try, even for me--a female--singing the way he does on such high notes is pretty hard).  His portrayal of Che is complex and does not confuse you with the complexity.  You can practically hear his thoughts aloud when he is walking up to kiss Evita's coffin: &quot;I could have loved you, but so much separated us in life that nothing was possible.&quot;, which may be part of why he hated her (sorry, a more diluted word escapes me at the moment).  I, personally, had no problem with the accent, as I have heard some theatre purists complain about it.        I believe Che may have respected Evita, even if he did not agree with her, and I think this movie shows that anyone has to, because of what she did.  She was not totally good or totally bad.  She was a human being, just like you and me, but she fought her way to the top, and you must admire her for that.  This movie did this great woman in Argentine and world history justice.      P.S.  Look for me one day playing Evita, because that has become my No. 1 role on my Most Wanted Musicals list.
0688145078|5.0|We received this book as a gift to my 22-month old son when his baby brother was born.  I thought it was so cute and he loves it.  That was 8 months ago and I can't remember how often I read it to him back then, but he asks for it to be read to him almost every day now!  Whenever I read the book to him, I have always substituted his name for the &quot;I&quot; in the book just to make it less confusing for him (so it doesn't sound like I (mommy) am the big brother).  He can relate to the pictures in the book because they look just like things we all have at home - the infant car seat, swing, baby bed with mobile, and even the toys they play on at the park.  It is kind of hard to tell which one is the Mom in the book, though!  I'm ordering the book for a friend whose 2 1/2 yr. old will be a big brother soon, too.  I highly recommend it!
B00005214X|5.0|George Harrison really didn't have to prove anything after the Beatles fallout. He did that on Abbey Road with &quot;Something&quot; and &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; (IMHO the 2 best tracks off that album, my favorite one by the Beatles). What he really did was announce to the world &quot;I told you so.&quot; He had tried to get more songs on albums, but Lennon and McCartney &quot;appeased&quot; him by &quot;letting&quot; him have 2 of their valuable tracks. One begins to wonder how mad they were if such wonderful tracks like &quot;Isn't it a Pity, and the title track were presented to the Beatles, but not given room on Let It Be or Abbey Road.  Good thing Harrison kept them because they are just 2 of the many awesome tracks. Tell me &quot;The Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp&quot; isn't as good as anything the Beatles did. The Remaster sounds great. It was much needed. Also, I wish the album was put on one disc and the apple jams and bonus trakcs on the other, but it still doesn't take anything away from this album. Buy it, cherish it. Tell your friends.
B000059R8Y|5.0|I bought the CD when it came out after I had much fun with &quot;Riding with the King&quot;. After having bought all of his recent years CDs I think that Eric is a lot like Single Malt Scotch whisky--the older he gets, the better his music. :-)<br />I had &quot;Reptile&quot; with me on my recent vacation while spending many hours on British Columbian highways driving through the mountains and other marvellous scenery and played that CD over and over again--couldn't get enough of it. In my humble opinion a definite 5 star CD (would give it 6 if possible).
B00003CX5P|5.0|The number one film of all time gets the number one DVD of all time...<br />The Star Wars Episode 1 The Phantom Menace DVD surpases any DVD ever released.  With over six and a half hours of bonus material, it is a must have for anyones collection.  <br />You will not be disapointed.
B00003CXHJ|1.0|U-571 is a film that was about WWII U-boats from the American forces stealing the enigma from the Germans, WRONG. This movie has got the real history all wrong. It was the Brittish(Poms) that took the Enigma off Hitlers army. I would know I studied WWII history at Oxford Universty.
0812550757|2.0|If you can wade through all of the painfully cheesy heartstring pulling and redundancy/bad writing then you'll find a couple really cool ideas, the coolest of which is Jane, a sentient computer program which teams up to help Ender tackle his problems.  The overall plot of the story adds to the scope of Card's universe, however I found myself literally wincing in pain throughout the book, eventually just skimming the last 100 pages just to find out the plot resolution so that I could put the book back on the shelf where it belongs.  All said, you'd do better to get the Cliffs notes rather than damage your opinion of Ender/Card.
B00003CXHJ|3.0|This film was okay as the action was qite intriguing however it lacked historical factors and wasn't eintirely correct. It all starts off with an American Captain leading his crew in WWII, who then leads his crew to victory eventually after many close misses with the Germans. It typically is quite stereotypical as it makes the Germans out to be the bad ones just like many other movies and the Americans to be the good guys. A inacurracy is during WWII the Americans weren't even in the war at that stage. It is a typical American movie when there is a lot of big baddies around with one small goodie (this being the U-571) and know matter how good the opponents the goodies (Americans) always come out on top. It is quite entertaining however and is enjoyable to watch.
0316286850|5.0|i'm a 15 year old girl and before i got this book, makeup wasn't a priority. Not that i was a feminist it's just that i was a complete idiot when it came to make up, but after reading this book,i can't wait to do my makeup in the morning . i saw that it was so easy and that you didn't need an unbelievable amount of makeup to pull of a look, less is more. i do my friends make up before dances, and i am i make up junkie (CVS and Target baby). all i have to say is thank you soooooo much Kevyn!! this book is a must for every female.
055321277X|4.0|We've probably all heard the story of Jekyll and Hyde, but reading the original tale for the first time is an introduction to what a true suspense novel is all about.  The horror of this tale comes not from the deed itself, but by its steadily being uncovered by Mr. Utterson, the respectable Victorian lawyer. Utterson's friend, Dr. Henry Jekyll, was also a respected Victorian man of a hard-working and decent nature.  He maintained a respectable persona in public while hiding his indecent, baser impulses.  Jekyll was troubled by the dual life he was leading, and so when his scientific interest led to mystical studies of the divided nature of man, he hoped to find a solution to his problem.  He dreamed of separating the good and evil natures within man and proving that &quot;man is not truly one, but truly two.&quot;<br />What follows is a step-by-step account of how his friend Utterson discovers the relationship between Jekyll and Hyde.  The reader is privvy to the torment of Dr. Jekyll, particularly in the final climactic chapter in which Dr. Jekyll in a letter to his friend explains all that has gone before.  This is not a horror story, as some movie versions have implied, but a psychological study of man's dual nature and the relationship between civilized man and uncivilized man.<br />Robert Louis Stevenson did a masterful job of building the tension and excitement and laying the groundwork for the final chapter, skillfully recounted in Dr. Jekyll's own words.
158234082X|5.0|I read Anthony Bourdain's hilarious article in THE NEW YORKER magazine last year and couldn't wait to read more about his years spent in the bowels of some of New York's finest restaurants.<br />KITCHEN CONFIDENTIAL did not disappoint. I laughed all the way through the book and learned a lot along the way. Think Hunter Thompson, drugs and all, writing about the restaurant business.<br />I learned that running a restaurant is not for the faint of heart. Just hauling all the bloody meat carcasses around would be enough to turn your stomach. Learning to carve the beef, fish, poultry and lamb would put me off the job right away. The pressure of turning out 600+ dinners in an evening is daunting.<br />Paying the bills, keeping the nut-case employees happy, knowing which Italian family currently controls disposal of waste, and trying to stay on top of the ever changing and always fickle American palette is enough to make anyone's head spin.<br />The leveling factor, or so it seems, is chemicals -- and lots of them. I don't think Bourdain has drawn a completely sober breath since he first stepped into a commercial kitchen at the Dreadnaught in Provincetown, Cape Cod. When they weren't drinking up profits from the Dreadnaught's bar, they were high on coke, LSD, mushrooms laced with honey, and finally, heroin.<br />As Bourdain explains:<br />So who the hell, exactly, ARE these guys, the boys and girls in the trenches? You might get the impression from the specifics of MY less than stellar career that all line cooks are wacked-out moral degenerates, dope fiends, refugees, a thuggish assortment of drunks, sneak thieves, sluts and psychopaths. You wouldn't be too far off base.<br />After reading this riotous tale, I've made some changes in my dining out behaviors. I will not eat fish on Mondays. I won't &quot;do brunch.&quot; I will schedule my dining excursions for weekdays, not weekends. I will never order anything well done and I won't insult the chef by asking for sauce &quot;on the side.&quot; I will sit at the bar and watch what comes out of the kitchen before ordering. I will skip lunch and save my appetite for dinner. Also, on my next trip to New York, I will make reservations Bourdain's restaurant, Brasserie Les Halles...for Tuesday night, of course!<br />If you want to know WHY I've changed my routines, read this book.

0805062971|5.0|This is the BEST book I have ever read, and, believe me, I have read quite a few, from &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot; by Dante to &quot;The Brother's Karamazov&quot; by Dostoevsky.  While the writing may not be the quality found in either of those two books, the paradigm altering concept(s) behind this book are of an unmatched quality.  Rarely does excellent writing come together with vivid imagery and dark, twisted, enlightenment -- but in Fight Club, everything comes to a head.
B000000IV0|5.0|When I heard that UltraDisc was making a \\"Gold Master\\" of Nevermind and In Utero, I emptied my bankaccount. Kurt often complained the standard version of Nevermind was too syrupy and processed, this mastering cuts through some of the syrup, but overall it kept the classic sound intact. The downside....and I highly warn you about this, the CD's potential can only be reached on a really good stereo set-up. On a normal boombox or discman the CD doesn't sound all that different. But with a good set-up words can't describe how much better this version sounds. So I'll leave it at that.
B00005LK95|5.0|I just watched the DVD today, and I have to say it's EXCELLENT!  The picture quality is EXCELLENT, and so is the sound.  I'm really impressed with this DVD.  Sure, it doesn't have many extras (just a few &quot;bonus trailers&quot; and very short featurette), but the quality of the DVD itself is astounding.<br />I'm glad I've finally been able to watch the movie again in widescreen.  I've seen Short Circuit 2 recently on HBO (a few times), and I didn't notice that in the full screen version that I was missing so much going on in the movie.<br />If widescreen isn't your thing, you still have no worries.  The DVD comes with the &quot;full screen&quot; version as well.  The disc is a flipper, meaning one side is widescreen while the other is fullscreen, thus satisfying both crowds.<br />As for the movie itself, I love it.  I've always loved this movie.  I like it more than the first Short Circuit, and mainly because this one focuses more on &quot;Number Five&quot; (Johnny Five) than the first movie.  It's funny at times, and there's even one part of the movie I get teary-eyed, no joke.  I think this movie teaches many important things, such as building and strengthening friendships (through the interaction between Johnny Five and the other characters), and it shows how to break the boundaries and treat everyone as equals.  It also shows you the delicacy of life.... (later in the movie--I won't SPOIL IT for you!).<br />I recommend this DVD for anyone that might need a good laugh here and there.  There are a few &quot;cuss words&quot; in the movie, so I don't know if I would recommend this for children that are too young.... but I would hate for children to miss such a movie.  I saw it when I was 8, and now I'm 21 and I still love it.  That says a lot for a movie that's now &quot;old.&quot;<br />If you decide to not buy it, then please at least rent it.  I think you'll find it to be a charming movie that most people will get something out of.

0792833236|5.0|Don't need to write too much to praise this film, cos everybody else on this site has done so.  Just wanna say this movie is about humanity at its truest and most sincere.  Anyone that knows about filmmaking could tell you Raging Bull is technically masterful; but it is the story and character that stay with you.  Scorsese and De niro told the story with such urgency and intimacy that it makes a viewer unable to remain detached from its emotion.
0792156684|5.0|Before writing this review i sat to read some of the other reviewer's opinions and after half hour or so , i've come to the following conclusion : people these days are not able to let themselfs free and enjoy a movie . Instead they are desperately trying to find it's weaknesses , faults and bad points . Titanic's massive advertise campain and hype made many people for many reasons angry . Many of them decided not to go because &quot; ...it's stupid , it's all corny and romantic . I'm a more serious viewer . I won't go and see this mumbo-jumbo crap because it's been advertised so much &quot; . Talking about a film withought seeing it is , in my opinion , stupid . Others went to see it but where determent not to like it anyway .Others stucked to weird details . Read some of the following reviews and you'll see what I'm talking about : &quot; ...those people running around would have suffer from hypothermia &quot; or &quot; those Picasso paintings still exist in museums . What are they doing on that ship? &quot; are some of the lines you will read.  The fact is that Titanic made a lot of people who never went to cinema to start going to the movies . It touched and made many of them cry . But for some ,this prooves a lack of high I.Q . The fact that Cameron chose to tell a love story at the same time the ship-tragedy takes place is logical. Should he just have focused at the sinking part ? No in my opinion because this would have make the film seem like a cold documentary. Could the script and the dialogues have been more mature and deep ? I don't think so . I don't believe that all those people had the time to analyze the purpose of life and the vanity of human existance at that point . Panic is the only feeling they must have experienced during that tragic night. I understand it when people tell me that they  had a good time but weren't that thrilled with it . What i don't understand is how could someone detest Titanic so much to not like even one line ,  one image (the frozen victims on the water for example ) , one perfomance .
B000002N3N|5.0|All of Enya's music and beautiful sounds soothed me as I traveled over 2000 miles to my little cabin on the lake in New England.  Of all the songs I missed hearing was \\"Amazing Grace\\" and would like to know on which CD it could be located.  I know it exists but just can't find it.  Please someone email me with the information.
0671027344|5.0|This almost explains my life to a T.  I can feel how charlie felt almost all the time.  Only difference is that I'm a girl and charlie's a guy and that doesn't exactly work.  But the book was great.  I think I'm gonna read it again because it's so good.  The poem in the book is awesome too.  just a great book.
B00005B6N8|4.0|&quot;Pitch Black,&quot; about a stranded group of space travelers threatened by voracious alien monsters, is an entertaining thriller. True, it's not the most original film: elements of this story are reminiscent of such past films as &quot;Aliens.&quot; But solid direction, performances, and special effects make this an above-average film of its genre. The ominous, threatening atmosphere is greatly enhanced by some outstanding cinematography. And Vin Diesel delivers a memorable performance as a criminal who is stranded with the rest. If you like sci-fi thrillers, I recommend &quot;Pitch Black.&quot;
B000001FS3|5.0|This, this is the album that made everyone shut up and listen to themeselves.  In an incresingly material, ammoral age, apathetic age, The Joshua Tree is what made everyone stop dead in their tracks and contemplate where they have been and where they are now.  This was the backlash album, the album where the greed-is-good decade was brough to an abrupt climax, and caused people to atleast try to become moral again. This album is meant for those sick of the amorality of our world, for those weary souls yearning for comfirmation that there is something better.   This album is just what the world needed in 1987, but in our incresingly commercial world, we still need albums such as the Joshua Tree more than ever.  Named after the legendary knotted tree that would bring direction through the prophet Joshua, this album promises to keep things in perspective, provide a much needed relief from an increasingly bloated world, let us know that there is something better, provide a beacon of inspiration and hope in an increasingly dismal world, and drive us to keep searching for what we are looking for, whatever that may be.<br />And the Joshua Tree keeps all of these promises to the very end.
B000000132|5.0|To me &quot;Turn of the Cards&quot; represents some of the finest music ever recorded by this great artist. With the soaring vocals of Annie Haslam and the incredibly tight compositions this CD is a sheer delight to listen to from beginning to end. If you are thinking about purchasing your first CD by Renaissance then this is a great CD to start with and if you are already a fan of this fantastic artist and don't already own this superb gem then what are you waiting for to purchase it? If you do decide to purchase this great recording you will be very glad that you did.
6305161879|3.0|Given that &quot;Wanda&quot; is way up there in my personal &quot;Top 25&quot; list, I eagerly anticipated its release on DVD and picked it up as soon as the opportunity presented itself.<br />Unfortunately, I'm rather disappointed in the DVD version.  Were there no deleted scenes or outtakes that could've been added?  Was there no behind-the-scenes documentary footage to show us?  Could Michael Palin and/or John Cleese not be persuaded to add any commentary to one of the audio tracks?  And speaking of the audio - why on Earth is the soundtrack in MONO??!?  When I saw that on the box, I thought that _had_ to be a misprint - but no, the soundtrack is indeed in bloody single-channel monophonic.<br />Sorry, MGM - you blew it with this one.
B000006OS2|1.0|The DVD is of very low quality due to the use of an old unrepaired master film. It is also in the pan/scan format for TV. If you want to see this movie in it's best form, watch it on Turner Classic in the cleaned up wide screen format.<br />I give this DVD 2 thumbs down.
0192838679|4.0|Those who have not see the movie &quot;Cruel Intentions&quot;, it is worth also reading the book, before you run to the video store.

079074841X|4.0|Eyes Wide Shut presents a married couple on the adult discovery of the true nature of sexual paradox.  Sex, as presented in most films or media, is shown to be:  a commodity that can be bought,  a taken for granted romantic bell and whistle,   a spiritual plateau,  or a pure fact of biological life.  Yet when the character of BILL hears his wife ALICE confess an extremely intimate sexual fantasy about another man, his preconceived ideas about sex (as mentioned above) are destroyd.  First, the romantic and faithful sex between husband and wife are shattered, then the biological fuction of life (in the old man's death scene) is weirded out when the grieving daughter hits on Bill, then the notion of prostitution is undermined and yields HIV, then sex as spiritual is revealed in a cult setting with dire consequences for Mandy, Bill, Alice,  and all concerned.   Sex is pleasure and it is death.  It is not any one thing and it is certainly not anything that anyone in the movie has a grip on.  This is a movie that dethrones sexual desire and acts as anything that can be understood...and yet it clearly is in everyone's life.  Kubrick's film is a revelation in an overly-sexed world that no matter how hard any of us tries, we cannot know sexuality like we claim.  There is an inner universe in Kubrick's film that comes clearly out into the open in the form of smooth tracking shots and lush lighting, colors and staging.  Why this film was marketed as a blockbuster just makes me laugh. It is the antithesis of that very notion.
0441172717|1.0|Thank goodness it takes only eight thousand years for a little political instability to worm its way in. Dune is crap. It's a bunch of pseudo-science hoodoo. I tried reading this book as a child and I was enchanted for awhile, the idea is so lovely it practically throbs. But really, for some reason, I just couldn't finish it. Now as an adult I tried again to read it and it's just more than silly. I guess Proust is right, you can't go home again. Or whatever. Maybe there was a time to read it and it passed. Of course, the idea is nice. If there was a book on the idea of Dune I'd probably read it. Even the idea of Frank Herbert. Just a book about some cat with a big prophet beard and a penchant for writing crackpot books of science fiction/philosophy. That would be nice. That would compel. Even if he veered at times dangerously close to fascism, which he does, and so does that Nazi Heinlein. It would be hilariously funny to read about some chubby floodge who wrote silly books of facsistic science fiction but never had the heart to get them published (there's a spin on things), and whose rantings were restricted--safely--to the confines of his kitchen. Funny. Sabbath's Science Fictional Theater. Yeah. But Dune is, sadly, really sadly, poorly written and should have been better. Sorry.
B00003CX5P|2.0|You know, I'm the type of guy who enjoys his DVD perks; deleted scenes and alternate endings are what I live for. Character bios and director commentaries are great too, if done well. These are the things that make a DVD you want to buy, rather than rent. look at \\"Dogma\\": 100 minutes of deleted scenes! Yikes! Plus candid commentary about the pitfalls of making this film. Not that you have to watch them all, but at least they're there if you want them.<br />I don't see this happening with \\"TPM\\".  First, His Greatness has held off way too long on bringing out the DVD version, KNOWING fans were begging for it. It wouldn't have taken that much more time, and sales would have been through the roof. Now, even I'm going to have to rent it before I make my decision as to it's worthiness.<br />Second, if the extra scenes contain any Jar-Jar , you'll be able to see the sales bar drop ...<br />Third, I'd pay more for Episodes 4,5&6 with just the deleted scenes we already know about than Epi 1. That's how much better these films are; even the lice-ridden Ewoks are more tolerable than most of the creatures from Anikins childhood.<br />Lastly, it's about ego. I don't feel like rewarding someone with my hard-earned money for having \\"artistic sensibilities\\" that deny me what I want. Movies are made for the public. Either give them what they want, or back off and let someone who will give it a shot.
B000003S0B|2.0|Well that's about the only thing here worth giving any real mention to. At this point, Fripp found himself completely at the helm when he really didn't want to be. Ian McDonald had left. Greg Lake was somewhat on hand, only as a guest vocalist on three tracks. He was also busy at that time working on the first Emerson Lake &amp; Palmer album. I know it may seem redundant to say that the first half of the album sounds like a bad copy of the first 3 songs on their debut, but so many other reviwers have said it and I have to agree. &quot;The Devil's Triangle&quot; is just an adaptation of Holst's &quot;Mars, Bringer Of War&quot; and not a very good one at that. A sentiment that Mr Fripp has stated himself. No mention was ever given in the credits to Holst.<BR> The critics pounced all over &quot;Lizard&quot; and &quot;Islands&quot;, while not saying too much one way or another about this one. Both of those albums blow this off the map just for pure originality alone. The only time I drag this one out is for &quot;Cat Food&quot;, which would have fit better in the context of &quot;Lizard&quot;, due to the manical piano stylings of Keith Tippet. Robert Fripp really begins to develop as a composer and guitarist after this clunker.
B00003CXHJ|4.0|The action was good, the story line was good, the Americans were supposed to be good (heroic, legends, the best(try hards)), and the Germans were bad.<br />If this film was meant to entertain us it did well, if this film was trying to teach us and state the truth they failed.<br />the Americans didnt get the enigma coder, the English got it before the Americans entered the war.<br />this like other false acusations and incorrect history didn't really bother me because i was there to watch and be entertained, and the film did this for me.<br />this film gave me the impression that the world was against the Germans and the Americans were the legends, this put the rating down a bit.<br />All up good film, hopless historical facts.
B00004X01U|5.0|Madonna's &quot;Music&quot; is my favorite album of all time.  The Parisian techno-pop is stunning.  Both William Orbit and especially Mirwais make awesome contributions.  Madonna's lyrics are beautiful and deeply earnest.  A wonderful endeavor on her part!  Standout tracks are &quot;Music,&quot; &quot;I Deserve It,&quot; &quot;Don't Tell Me,&quot; and &quot;What It Feels Like for a Girl.&quot;
B00005IBGQ|3.0|Say what you will about Rufus Wainwright, but his flamboyant stage persona and bratty but lovable interviews can't overshadow the fact that his records ooze with talent. Poses doesn't quite reach the astronomical majestic moments that his first album did; but it certainly has it's keepers. Wainwright continues to grow into an amazingly powerful singer. His sparkling pipes could blow the roof off of a theater - with or without a microphone. This kind of vocal talent is not only god-given, but the kind that one must hone and work on through lots of work. Rufus Wainwright is a singer's singer, and his style is probably lost on those who have not had some kind of training - vocal or musical - themselves. Nonetheless, even if you're not musically inclined; all you need is a keen sense of melody and pop song literacy to appreciate this new collection of songs. Highlights include the title track, a piano number reminicient of his work in his debut album; as well as &quot;California&quot; a pop radio-friendly ditty that would probably climb the charts if we were in a different time. &quot;Grey Gardens&quot; is gorgeous as is his cover of his Dad's fine tune &quot;One Man Guy&quot; - a terrific song that family friend Syd Straw covered as an opener for her wonderful shows  on her last run through LA and NY. Like Rickie Lee Jones and Cat Stevens, Wainwright is certaily one to watch closely as he continues to develop as a songwriter and singer. American radio won't let him in, so be sure to follow on your own and soak up everything he has to offer. He's the real thing - and the real thing doesn't seem to come around too often these days. Now all we need to do is get Jon Brion to produce his next record. That would be something special.
B000005RFQ|4.0|When I heard that one of the greatest heavy metal bands and one of the greatest hard rock/metal singers had collaborated, I was naturally intrigued; at first mention it does not seem that a union of Ian Gillian and Black Sabbath would be &quot;natural.&quot; Having listened to this album several times now, I'm still not quite sure it is... Regardless, this is a very interesting record and one well-worth finding; with the exception of &quot;Keep It Warm,&quot; every track is a winner, even the two instrumentals. Iommi and Butler create great riffs as usual, especially on the extremely foreboding &quot;Zero the Hero,&quot; which is as menacing as anything Sabbath created with Ozzy or Dio (no other band is as adept at creating a mood as Black Sabbath). And Gillian... he turns in an incredible performance. While it could be argued that perhaps his regular singing voice does not fit the Sabbath vibe, it does not detract from the material. When Gillian wails, however, any doubts that he does not &quot;belong&quot; are erased - at times he sounds more otherworldly than the music, not even sounding remotely like a human being (especially at the end of &quot;Disturbing the Priest&quot;). For one record Ian Gillian takes us on a journey with Black Sabbath, and it is not one you will soon forget.
B00004XQP4|5.0|To begin, I'm sick of people saying that us who enjoy listening to this CD are not real music fans.  Maybe we enjoy listening to a CD that's actually melodic, and not just screaming into the microphone.  And now, the tracks.<br />Warning: Excellent track, but doesn't make a whole lot of sense.  Oh well, what can you do?<br />Blood, Sex, and Booze: My least favorite song on the album.  The guitar riff in the background is just too repetitive, and Billie Joe sounds like he has nose plugs on.<br />Church on Sunday: You'll be humming this one for days.  It will be stuck in your head whether you want it to or not.<br />Fashion Victim: One of my favorites.  It mixes light and heave guitar riffs just right.<br />Castaway: Excellent, but not my favorite.  A little too fast paces.<br />Misery: A little like Jewish klezmer music.  I could probably get away with playing this at a bar mitzvah.<br />Deadbeat Holiday: Again, not one of my favorites.  Too repetitive.<br />Hold On: My second favorite song on the album.  I love the harmonica opening.<br />Jackass: Ehh.  Very average.<br />Waiting: I love the syncopated guitar riff.  Had me tapping my foot to it relentlessly.<br />Minority: Wow!  A mix of an Irish jig and punk rock.  I just wish it could have been longer.<br />Macy's Day Parade: A rant against corporate takeover of every aspect of our lives.  Good way to close out the album, very melodic and with a good message.<br />In closing, don't buy this CD expecting hard rock, but if you want music you can actually sing along to, pick it up.
B000003NA3|5.0|Greensleeves - truly perfect music. Some artists have nothing of value in their entire career, despite selling millions - U2 spring to mind - conversely some CD's are worth buying for just one track, even at this price. The rest is great too.
630588255X|3.0|The film is a worthy cause gone astray. One knows that Harold's baby-face charm will not be enough to sustain the film, and adult supervision is urgently needed. Maude comes to the rescue, changing the tone of the film for the worse. Maude is grossly over-acted. The self-indulgence in the acting of her character makes the idiosyncracies of Harold's death wish look almost monastic. The story, like that of many films made in the 70s, is too self-righteous to be taken seriously. The writer and the director like Harold and Maude so much that they run off the tangent in terms of plausibility. The failure of the film is a pity. Our over-organized life badly needs an antidote promised by this film. The problem is that a promise is all we got.
B00004XQP4|5.0|this c.d is really great ive got most of there albums and this is one of the best the best buy far is macy day parade
B00005BJ2O|3.0|I was floored by the movie &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; and quickly went out to purchase the soundtrack. Imagine my dissappointment when many of the wonderful songs from the movie were missing from it. In their place were frivolous versions sung by stars who never even graced the flashy &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; in the picture. The songs that are performed by the cast, however, are real gems, and make the CD worth the money spent on it.
B00004ZEQX|3.0|First of all, good movie.  Much gore, okay plot. Typical Amnityville storyline: good people + bad house = goretastic thills and bloody spills.<br />Now, about the d.v.d.  Problems were constant freezing throughout earlier part of movie.  My d.v.d. player is almost two years, and I've never had a problem like this before where the counter was erased and disc was unable to be ejected. As it got into the movie, problems slowly went away; but back to the menu, problems occured again.<br />Other than that the picture and sound were a 10.  Definately worth the money if you can find a d.v.d. that doesn't have the curse.  For the money, I'm sure a good 1 out of 3 probably have this problem.  Is it worth getting the [price]. version? I don't think so, unless you have a passion for Fulci.<br />But beware of the cheaper [price] version.  Keep your receipt and buy it somewhere where it's easy to return.
B000056K04|5.0|It really all boils down to this: If you are a die hard Dave Matthews Band fan and have a lot of concerts on CD-R or what have you and love the live sound when they jam out songs, you will probably not like this CD.  However if you are a fan of just purely great emotional music that can get into your soul and give you goosebumps and have you singing the songs in your car then &quot;EVERYDAY&quot; is the album for you.  Many fans are confused about this album, saying that it is not DMB at all.  I beg to differ.  Just give &quot;Space Between&quot; a couple listens, what a song that is, The best DMB song to date.  &quot;Angel&quot; with its comparison of love to a game of cards (cliche but beautiful).  &quot;When the World Ends&quot; it's a great song that abruptly ends.  &quot;Dreams of Our fathers&quot; another great song.  And the 2nd best song on the cd being &quot;So Right&quot; proves that Dave Matthews Band can do many things with its music.  Diehard fans may say that they have gone pop, who cares, if the music is good?
0486411818|5.0|Excellent. Well writen. Although simple its thorough and its mathematical treatment is good enough. It covers most of the important aspects of the method. If I sould choose between this book and the Bathe Book witch is a clasic i would recoment this one as a first read. Its much easier to read and more self study orienteted. 5 Stars Rating.
0316777722|4.0|I love David Sedaris's writing and performances, So I couldn't wait to read this book. And I wasn't disappointed -- it's laugh-out-loud funny. But I *was* puzzled. The first half and the second half are two entirely different books. I found myself wondering if Sedaris had simply glued together two unrelated pieces so he could make deadline, or capitalize on his success, or just get the book done already. Hmmm. Well, both halves are fun and funny, so the book as a whole is a good read. But I wish Sedaris had taken his time and fleshed out both essays so we could have two books instead of one.
B00003CXRM|2.0|This just goes to show that I should never listen to hype and reviews on movies.  This movie isn't even in the same league as one of their previous movies &quot;Fargo&quot;, which I continue to watch and never get tired of.   I found this movie boring, difficult to follow, and annoying.  I guess I must have missed it's &quot;Deep meaning&quot; somewhere.  Personally - I would have been dissapointed in the rental cost of this despite the fact that I actually purchased it.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|Just like the film, this CD is certainly not for everyone. Yet, if you enoyed the music, I can assure you that you will love the soundtrack. It's true not all songs from the film are included on the CD, but the postmodern and pastiche interpretation of some very familiar songs is really astonishing and very refreshing. Ewan MeGregor is fabulous, his voice is truely touching. My favoirtes are 'El tango de Roxanne' and 'Hindi Sad Diamonds'. A great and innovative soundtrack!
B000055WIQ|1.0|Being an admirer of \\"The Exorcist&quot; I didn't like &quot;the version you've never seen\\" at all. They did a great job remastering the picture and sound. But I think the film lost something, something small but very important. It's like coloring black-and-white pictures, a kind of sacrilege. And the segments they added, added nothing new to the movie. So I will keep the old tape, the original release.
0790729628|2.0|I resubmit this review as a service to DVD fans... Won't waste your time with movie analysis, just the DVD complaints:<br />1. No extras, like commentary, outtakes, etc.<br />2. No 5.1 sound<br />3. No DTS<br />4. Doesn't include both versions: with voice over and without.<br />I keep reading a new version is due out. Consensus seems to be wait and see if Warner addresses any of these complaints before buying. That's what I'm doing.
0385335482|4.0|If you're searching for a relaxing, LIGHT read for the summer, look no further. This book is so much fun, and the pages fly by in a breeze! You couldn't ask for a better book for a trip to the beach or to accompany you on a long plane ride. Rebecca's adventures -- and the rationalizations that keep her shopping, despite the fact that, as a financial journalist, she knows better! -- are guaranteed to keep you laughing. This is another terrific British novel in the tradition of Bridget Jones et al. I'm so happy that American publishers have started bringing us more of these books by hip young UK writers. Keep 'em coming, please!
B00004Z459|5.0|I have never owned a cd I could relate to more than Hybrid Theory. They are so powerful with their language and the songs can relate to real life. They are not afraid to be real and be true artists. I am a life long fan now because I know them and I know they will continue to be true and real. I thank them for this CD. It is the best cd I could ever own.
B00003CX5P|4.0|The most anticipated movie of all time is a substantial slogan a movie should hold, Star Wars Episode I The Phantom Menace unfortunately had to suffer the consequenced of this title. Lets face it people, the movie aint THAT bad. Sure Jar Jar should have been sliced and diced in his first 10 seconds of his screen time and Jake Lloyd's &quot;Yipee's&quot; do get annoying but the adventure, atmosphere and sheer fun of all the Star Wars movies is evident The Phantom Menace. I Refuse to beleive that not one veiwer smirked at how bizarr, quirky and downright hypnotic this film was. <br />What I think that people dont realise is The Phantom Menace is the film that it started to intended to be. Their were meant to be alot of special effects because this is a special effects movie!!!! Some movies dont have ANY special effects, but this movie had crap loads, is that SO hard to expect? <br />I must admit, I did go into this movie, 14 years of age, expecting it to be the best movie of my dreams, of course it wasnt and I dont think any other movie could fill those heafty expectations of anyone.<br />Another joy of The Phantom Menace is to see the brilliant range of amazingly talented actors that are in the movie: Liam Neeson, Ewan Mc Gregor, Pernilla August, Terence Stamp and Natalie Portman are all cult hit actors in their own right, and just because they chose a project that was a bit more big budgeted than the rest of the films they have done, there is no reason to ridicule them for it, they are in it for the fun of it, just as YOU should be.<br />So when you sit back and relax and watch The Phantom Menace,throw your brain out the window, and enjoy one of the most amazing technical and inspirational piece of cinema ever.
B00005LB9O|3.0|Travis has brought out another quality product.  A safe formula is given and stuck to throughout the album.  The results are blissful tunes.  The problem as in &quot;The Man Who&quot; is the monotonous quality of the album.  There is very little variation.  So then my question is &quot;Where is the rock?&quot;  We know Travis can rock.  If there are any doubts of this, check out the hidden track, &quot;Flashing Blue Light&quot; on &quot;The Man Who.&quot;  Now it's not like I'm asking for a whole album of radiohead-like rock.  Travis, like quite a few British bands, is still crafting better music than most American bands. The request is for variety.  Although I love &quot;side&quot; and &quot;pipe dreams,&quot; sometimes I just want to hear some fuzz.  Travis has only provided for that once with &quot;flashing blue light.&quot;   Still, I am enjoying this more than &quot;The Man Who.&quot;
B00005BJ2O|5.0|My fav. songs from the movie are: The Secret Love Song, and How Wonderful Life is Now That Your in the World. Before I go and buy the CD, I wanna know if it has those songs. So please post a review to answer my question. Thanks a bunch!!
B00004TRD8|5.0|Thats not a bad thing... There are so many extras on this DVD that it is insane.  This is how DVDs should be made.  This is without a doubt the best DVD I have ever owned.  This Dual Sided &amp; Dual Layered DVD packs so much it is hard to believe including 3 versions of the film (the third is a hidden Easter Egg) and details on every detail of the filmaking process.  Photos show every detail including the mechandising &amp; advertizing, as well as filming.  A ton of Trailers and Making Of featurettes are also included as well as the full Script, Cast Bios, and Commentaries.  Cool animated menus are just the icing on the cake!  The film looks and sounds great especially in DTS.  This DVD is worth owning even if you aren't a fan of the film.  (...And trust me, you will become a fan of the film once you own this DVD!)
0061053147|5.0|Any fan of the movie would find this detailed study fascinating. At times the detail seems to be more than you need; but in the end, this book will serve as an excellent chronicle of a difficult project which was released to lackluster business, only to acquire, over the years, the status of modern classic.
B00003CXHJ|4.0|U-571 is a film about americas involvement in the process of breaking the enigma codes. it uses fantastic graphics and themusic completely gives a title of heroism for the americans and relly tenses the viewer in a climax point. the film gives no chance to really bond to the germans as they are portrayed as evil and they are beastily unshaven men and it all falls into perspective. the americans however as in all american war films are portrayed as heroic young well presented men that hardly ever swear and sre always there to save someone. The americans when storming the U-boat seem to ecape any injury while the germans seem to cop the bullets whenever needed so. the plot all seems to fall into place and give the americans a form of great heroism and all in all a good movie does the job, the job has been done and a good movie has been made a good view and the climaxes are awesome. to bad its alittle corny towards the americans.

B000002IZM|5.0|The soundtrack to Ridley Scott's second major motion picture (following \\"Alien\\"), \\"Bladerunner\\" is an excellent complement to a stressful drive to have on the CD player.  Following the plot of the movie, the flow from track to track is logical and pleasing.  A mere forty-four minutes long, it has a way of relieving stress and making one feel like he or she is actually in the future.  Other problems don't seem to be as important at the moment.  How can you put a price on such a valuable recording?

B00003CX5P|5.0|I know this is an unpopular view - but I thought Phantom Menace was well done. Granted, the creatures (like Jar-Jar) got annoying. But when people say that, I wonder what they thought of the Catina scene in Episode IV, or the Ewoks in Episode VI, or Jabba's palace, also in Episode VI, or perhaps the Jawas in Episode IV. To me the cute and cuddly Ewoks taking on the Empire was less believable than the Gungans in Phantom Menace.<br />The story in Episode I was much more fleshed out. I love the original trilogy, but the dialogue is severely lacking in many places. (Witness the scene between Leia and Han in the Ewok village discussing her alleged feelings for Luke in Episode VI for just one example.) All of the movies are very cliched in many respects: there are a lot of dystopian viewpoints in it as well as Messianic overtones and even some Arthurian/Templar type mythology. And that is what Star Wars is: a recasting of many of our major myths in a science-fictional format. It still astounds me the people who fail to realize this and treat it as such.<br />I thought this movie did a good job of showing the initial formation of the Empire via the machinations of Senator Palpatine/Darth Sidious. No movie is going to be perfect (especially when matched up against people's expectations; even though they rarely know what their expectations were) but I think Episode I was a worthy addition to the Star Wars mythos.<br />I take heart, however. Star Wars Episode IV gathered pretty bad initial reviews as well when it came out in 1977. It took people a little while to come around. Perhaps the same will occur with Episode I.<br />I have also seen a lot of specific complaints about the movie:<br />&quot;Anakin not being dark enough.&quot; That would miss the point. The point is: he is the balance. This goes back to the mythology aspects of Star Wars, and is reminiscent of the idea of the seventh son. What this means is that Anakin is one of those that can be swayed to good or evil.<br />&quot;The midichlorians.&quot; What is wrong with that? Star Wars was a little too much like mysticism with the Force originally. I like the idea of this being a pervasive force throughout the universe (like a Higgs field in our own universe) that can be channeled by people. This should have a ready place in the hearts of New Agers or those who believe in the ability of people to channel energy around them. I am not one of those people - but at least I like this attempt to explain how some people can utilize the Force and others cannot.<br />&quot;Technology is better.&quot; Well, visually the movie looks better! Does that mean the technology shown in the movie is better? Are there some detailed specs that are floating around for each ship and that someone has done a massive comparison of? I doubt it. The droids were basically droids. The ships were quite obviously precursor designs in various cases to X-Wings and Tie-Fighters. This movie only took place 32 years prior to the events in A New Hope. Thus we would expect improvements but not necessarily massive change considering that during that time the Empire was in power and thus, much like the Roman Church in our history, clamped down on technology. And that is what we see: from the relatively simple ships, we later see Death Stars, Star Destroyers, and Mon Calamari carrier craft.<br />&quot;Jar-Jar.&quot; Okay, to some degree he might have been annoying. On the other hand, how different was he from Wicket (one of the Ewoks in Return of the Jedi)? I agree he was a little bit corny but, then again, Lucas probably wants to appeal to younger and older audiences - always a delicate balancing act. In fact, Jar-Jar was sort of the Wicket of this movie - he introduced the Jedi's to the Gungans (much as Wicket introduced the Rebels to the Ewoks).<br />Also consider that this movie followed the theme of Return of the Jedi, particularly near the end. We had three battles going on: the space battle, the ground battle, and the light-saber duel. Think about Return of the Jedi and you will see that the same thematic ideas were used. Both movies showed a relatively inferior race (the Gungans and Ewoks) coming under the control of an ostensibly more powerful force and then, in the end, winning out. I bring this up because I have seen many people who claim they liked (or even loved!) Return of the Jedi say they hated this movie.
1878424319|3.0|This book was added to my collection after being invited to a local monthly book club.  My husband read it too and we plan to attend the discussion together this week.  <br />The Four Agreements, provides typical self-help and personal growth advice.  &quot;Toltec&quot; wisdom reiterates positive thinking and confidence in yourself.

B00004XOWM|1.0|i dont think this cd is worth anything. How could you spend years making this, build up all this hype, and turn up with this? Is this even music?
0380973650|5.0|There are a couple of writers out there that have a tendency to twist your imaginations.  They make you see the world in a way that while totally consistant with what you've seen so far, illuminates it in a totally different way.  Kinda like standing in one place and looking west at Noon and Sunset.  The landscape is the same but the picture is totally different.<br />American Gods is a look at a country that doesn't believe in very much, or at least not for very long.  It's a place that doesn't really believe in it's own past, forgetting it for the sake of convenience.  It encompases the Melting Pot of America and the sad truth to what becomes of the beliefs brought over to this country.  Neil Gaiman does a marvelous job mixing and matching the past, the legends and the truths that have made this country what it is.<br />An all around excellent read. Highly Recommended.
0783222955|5.0|True to the novel from which it was drawn, this movie combines a number of stellar performances from a tremendously talented cast to produce what I think of as the quintessential American film. The issues it deals with are the big ones- love, death, growing up and racism- and it views them through the clear eyes of a young child. I've been watching this film at least once a year since I was a child. It still never fails to move me.
0780626966|5.0|If you are a &quot;Nightmare&quot; fan, this set of the entire series is a must buy. It contains all of the movies plus a bonus disk full of special features. The sixth movie even comes with 3-D glasses so you can see the special ending. No collection will be complete without this set!
B00002MZ2T|5.0|One of my favorite artists, Australians Savage Garden has done a superb job in making this album. The songs are pretty good from the romantic &quot;I Knew I Loved You&quot; to the sad &quot;The Lover After Me&quot;. They're not like boy bands with their &quot;dirty&quot; pop tunes like 'N Sync or the seductive Britney Spears. They have a unique calm syle of pop that deserves to be on the top of the charts. One star for great music, one star for great lyrics that have been written by lead singer Darren Hayes himself along with his musical assistant Daniel Jones. One star for deserved popularity, one star for great vocals by Darren Hayes and one star for a good style of music. I could underate this group, but have found no reason why.<br />5 stars is my rating and there is no good reason why you cannot rate this album one star.
0380973650|5.0|Neil Gaiman's work is always imaginative, fun and provocative, but this time it's more.  He combines myth and history, politics and pop culture, with a variety of characters that ring true as gods, legends and people.<br />The book sweeps across the continent and through 15 millennia, yet it reads as a most personal story.<br />It's really great.
B00004YX39|4.0|Expressing my thoughts as a fan who thinks \\"The Royal Scam\\" quite boring, I have to say I think \\"Gaucho\\" a cool masterpiece. & although the quality coefficient fares lower than in \\"Aja\\" which is pretty perfect, I would have to say that this album actually has a song that is so beautiful & funny & slick & just plain GORGEOUS that your jaw will drop & you will spend some days playing it again & again - as I have for the past few days - & the name of that song is... \\"Gaucho\\", a much better track than the nice & groovy - but nonetheless preppy - \\"Time Out of Mind\\". I have this feeling that \\"Gaucho\\" is about Jesus, but then again, it might be my hermeneutical fancy weaving its treacherous path of delusion rather than exactitude speaking with sanity: yet that is the best thing about Becker & Fagen's musical genius: they just let your mind roam free & the lyrics are so obscure/inviting/puzzling/witty that you end up having as much fun listening to the music as trying to figure out what...they're going on about. If there is one thing I envy the 70s generation about it is their excellent music, that amazing soundtrack to boring existence that just seems to lift you up & make you feel better for just polluting this planet. As a teenager in the 90s I felt that there was lots of interesting things happening too: but as a 20 something seeing the new century open up with a dearth of talent I am learning to appreciate the gems of the past. Since the music industry is going to the dogs there is really nothing one can do but accept that fact that rock & roll is dead & that it lasted for about 40 years, four decades: & that's it. It went dead somewhere during the 90s & I, for one, don't see how it can return. One more reason to sing along to this one: the lovely & voluptuous eponymous track alone makes it quite worth it!...
0394521684|5.0|This book is out of print and very hard to come by, hence its largely inflated &quot;collector's&quot; price, but well worth every penny!  Much of the book contains the conceptual design artwork Brian Froud did for the Henson production &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot;.  Considered Henson's biggest box-office failure, it has gained much more appreciation in recent years since its recent DVD Release packed with extra features (which I also highly recommend).  The World of the Dark Crystal contains the memoirs of Aughra, one of the film's main characters and follows her first-person account of what the world was like before the Crystal was shattered and the events leading up to its healing. Froud's dark and cryptic, yet elegant and beautifully mysterious, illustrations bring much depth and life to Aughra's story, and were carried over into memorable creatures seen in the film itself. Highly recommended for fans of The Dark Crystal, Henson puppetry, Froud artwork or just wonderful aestethically pleasing pictures.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Even thought a lot of people says that this movie is not great, i have to disagree with them. To catch the greatness of this movie, you have to think of it as part of a whole. You have to remember that The Return of the Jedi means that ANAKIN comes back from the dark side of the force, so the whole movie its about ANAKIN and his offspring, but mainly ANAKIN. I also think that Lucas took too long to release the DVD. I cant wait to have them both in my hands and enjoy the movie with full quality, great sound and new footage while I wait till Lucas wants to release the Original Trilogy on DVD and complete the episode II. I already have the VHS version, and I will enjoy the movie even more now on DVD. To all the people that havent seen any episode of this movie, go ahead, and see how Anakin becomes a bad guy, and the circumstances that force him to rethink his behaviour and redeem with himself, his friends and family. This movie is a MUST for your family. The special effects, comic relief, and other stuff, are a plus, not the main reason to see the movie. The main reason is the Plot itself.
6303471714|2.0|I would highly recommend skipping this video and getting Cindy's &quot;The Next Challenge&quot; video instead.  On this tape, she moves far too quickly for correct form,  offers very little instruction,  and often gives the impression that this is a tape to show off her beautiful self, rather than a fitness tape.  The Next Challenge is far superior in that she spends a lot of time on correct form, the workout is much more thorough with a wide variety of excercises, and the pace is much easier to follow correctly.  Obviously, &quot;second time's a charm&quot; applies here.
1577311523|5.0|Although I had studied elements of what Eckhart Tolle writes for many years and made tremendous gains from doing so, I have never seen the information so simply and beautifully communicated before. I prefer straightforward useful information to parables or obscure references. This book puts complex ideas in a form so simple that reading the book is effortless and pleasurable and yet extremely powerful. I felt changes occuring just by reading the information and that was only the beginning. Applying it on a regular basis provides ongoing, neverending improvement. Even for readers with lots of earlier experience with these concepts, there will be something new and better. As a certified trauma counselor, I've used these ideas extensively, even to the point of writing a book called &quot;Your Mind and Body are a Corporation and You are the CEO&quot; filled with ways to help &quot;become the watcher&quot; where mind and body are concerned. In spite of all that experience with these concepts, I still found great benefit from what this book contains. Thanks so much for the wonderful book, Mr. Tolle.
B00004XQ83|5.0|This sound track brings the average music listener is contact with the some of the greatest blue grass/early blues/folk ever recorded.  These songs are simply filled with 100% authenticity, love, and soul. Perhaps the greatest charm of this magnificant collection is that it seems to have no mass commercial value whats so ever, save a few hollywood stars in the movie.   When I saw the movie, the song that moved me the most was Man of Constant Sorrow, which is the best song I've heard in years. (being a rock musician, that's not easy to say, but it's the truth). This song is followed by simply the most pure and wonderous American music you'll ever hear. This album receives my highest recommendation I could possibly give anything.  If you're a music fan, this is an instant classic you MUST have.  Only improvement I would make is listing when the songs were written and when they were recorded.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Some facts regarding Beatles 1 are: for a song to make this collection, it had to be released as a single in either England or America, AND go to no 1. Love me do DID go to no 1 in America in april of 1964,and stayed there for one week! Yesterday went to no 1 in America for four weeks in september of 1965!Every song on here went to the top as a &quot;A&quot; side in one of the two countries!Regarding the music itself,if any album deserves to become the biggest seller ever(and Beatles 1 is on it's way), this is it!
0452282152|2.0|I was so excited to read this book--every time I saw it in the book store I thought..this is the next one!  However, upon finishing the novel I am left with a sense of longing for a deeper, more richly worded novel, and a plot that does not leave one hanging on for more.  The plot is too simple and ends with little to no resolution.  Griet realizes very little about herself, and we are left not liking or especially disliking Vermeer.  One would like to cultivate a reader's relationship with him as well.  I wanted much more in this novel.
B000059XY5|5.0|this movie rules. I remember i saw this when i was a kid, but it still kicks. The penguin is pretty sweet. So is catwoman. After a deformed, abused child (penguin) is given away at birth, he rises to power in Gotham city. Since he hates batman, he tries to frame him, but after batman thwarts his plan, he loses. Lots of action, and suspense. Micheal gives a better performance, than is in Batman1. So get this if you liked that one, but this one has way more action.
0316777722|2.0|Too sarcastic for me!  Hearing him read it was worse.  He does sound like a little whimpy girl.  Some parts were hillarious, but overall I didn't like it and wouldn't recommend it as a book club discussion book, or for the squeamish.
B000001E7V|5.0|This is a terific album. My first exposure to Tricky was \\"Hell Is Around The Corner\\" off the 'Rebirth of Cool Phive' compilation and it was good. On 'Maxinquaye', Tricky teams with Martine, whose rangey voice joins with his low, growly tone. There is not a weak track on the album, as Tricky uses deep and pulsating beats, tripy and eerie sounds, a dubby influence, soothing bass, samples, distortion and effects. Of course more \\"conventional\\" instruments are used to make the sound of this album complete.<br />The other aspect of this album are the incredible lyrics. They are confronting sexually and politically, but it works well for Tricky on this album, an example is on \\"Ponderosa\\" where Martine sings \\"...underneath the weeping willow lies a weeping wino\\" and in \\"Overcome\\" we hear \\"...and when we f#@K we'll hear beats...\\", which is a mild lyric compared to some found on \\"Abbaon Fat Track\\".<br />As mentioned, all tracks are without weakness and their play order is excellent. If I had to pick a couple to point out, they'd be \\"Black Steel\\", \\"Pumpkin\\", \\"Aftermath\\" and \\"Suffocated Love\\".<br />Unfortunately, the remaining CDs of Trickys' that I have heard or own are quite weak in comparisson to this masterpiece of sorts. If you're into Massive Attack, Portishead or Lamb, you'll be sure to like this classic Trip Hop album.
B00003CXRM|4.0|Oddly enough I did not know this film was based on the Oddysey. But when telling someone about it, I described it as an oddysey, in that the heroes travel from place to place and meeting strange and sometimes famous people with whom they champion their way through difficulties.  Because of the title and the poster images, a lot of people think this is a rather heavy film with some humor. If you want to get a bead on what this film is most similar to in flavor and in its unfolding I would say Pee Wee's Big Adventure. It is laugh out loud funny very early on. And as a bonus you get to listen to a really outstanding soundtrack you may even want to own. I was talking over the film with a friend and we both agreed this was George Clooney's best and most likeable role to date. Perhaps John Turturo's as well. So if you are not fond of either of these actors, set your reservations aside. Oh Brother, Where Art Thou became popular through word of mouth. The audience I saw the film with really was enjoying this film, especially the &quot;Man of Constant Sorrow&quot; segment, and you should have a good time as well.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Every true Star Wars fan knows and loves this movie. If you knew what happened before &quot;The New Hope&quot;, then following this movie is easy. But if you do not follow and were expecting action sequences like in &quot;Empires Strikes Back&quot; or &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; then it is your loss. This was a time of peace in the universe and corruption in the Senate, and this movie lays the ground work perfectly. Buy it, rent it, do whatever it takes to see this movie.
B00003CWNR|4.0|John Irving, author of the novel, also wrote the screenplay for this film.  So it's difficult to say that the film doesn't stay true to the novel.  I watched the film before I read the novel, and I could tell there were things missing.  For instance, Homer Wells is passionately anti-abortion, but there is no reason given for this.  The film is still good though, if you accept some things on faith.  It still tells a good story, and it is similar to the one in the novel.  I do recommend reading the novel afterwards though.  It is different enough to be new and fresh, and also makes the film more enriching.
B000002HRE|4.0|This is going to be a brief review as it is basically a twin album to Load, and I got everything off my chest in that review. This was originally going to be released as part of a double album with &quot;Load&quot;, until they realized they could make more money by releasing more singles if they released them as two separate albums, and this would also give them the time to write better songs. (Smart move!) Although some don't like James Hetfield's new approach to singing, it's tolerable in small doses. This is a mammoth album, so I usually don't listen to it all at once. The riffs also make a return on this album, after their complete absence on &quot;Load&quot;, something which many will be happy about.<br />The first and the last tracks rock, and it's a mixed bag in between. &quot;Fuel&quot; is a great solid metal song, and for some reason I am addicted to &quot;Fixxxer&quot;...I could just put it on repeat for hours. It's an awesome song. The only places I thought where they were being too light for their own good were &quot;The Unforgiven 2&quot; (country-rock from Metallica?) and &quot;Low Man's Lyric&quot; (which, unlike most Metallica songs, starts slow and STAYS slow.) I do like these songs, however they are just not something I would expect a band like Metallica to play.<br />I told you this would be quick and painless...A solid album that is quite a bit better than &quot;Load&quot;...it doesn't get the extra star for all the offset ratings though as there aren't as many. However, still, don't start with this, unless the heaviest music you've listened to in your life is alternative.
630522577X|5.0|If you are reading this review I am going to assume you already are a fan of this musical. Audrey Hepburn Rex Harrison and Stanley Holloway are unforgettable. If you have somehow missed the film this is a musical even people who don't like musicals will be won over by. I had not seen the film for many years but I have been buying and playing a lot of DVDs as I purchased a projector this year.  My Fair Lady is one of the truly great experiences I have had with the DVD.  If you are trying to select DVDs that excel in both picture and sound and supplemental features you should include this film in your collection.  This DVD version of My Fair Lady is far and away the best ever released.  It has been painstakingly and lovingly restored to near perfection. The supplemental commentaries on the disc are fascinating and discuss the restoration process at length.  This is one commentary where I really felt educated about cinematography specialized techniques.  Having seen this film I watched David Lean's restored version of Lawrence of Arabia and I could really tell they didn't put as much into the restoration as this film.  I am no expert  but felt like one after listening to the supplemental materials.  The picture in my room is ten feet diagonal so I can really see flaws. This disc is near perfection. The colors are rich and vibrant and show the subtle details of all the costumes. Particular attention was made to not lose the details in the blacks and bright whites of the costumes.  I am frequently a little disappointed with the Surround Sound on many films but this fills the room with lush magnificent sound that is just spectacular.  If you want a disc that shows off both your sound and video system this is gold. Especially if you want to have something to play your parents will enjoy as most of the really good films to show off are in the sci fi genre.  The real reason to buy this disc is it is fabulous entertainment.  But for picture and sound you may never own, or own only a few discs that were transfered with such care.only a few discs that were transfered with such care.
B000002513|4.0|I recently sat down and listened to my vinyl recording of this album.  The record is in good shape and the turntable is top notch and this recording is really, really bad.  I don't see how a digital transfer could help things without some serious time put into remastering and perhaps even remixing this sonic mush.  I loved this album back in the 70s and I guess my expectations for sonic quality have increased markedly.<br />But these are sublime songs.  &quot;Wild Billy's Circus&quot; would not have been out of place on Greeting From Asbury Park.  It is folky and surreal at the same time.  &quot;Sandy&quot; is the musical bridge from the first to the second album.  It is quiet, romantic song with a wonderful accordion in the fore of the mix.  But it is the epics on this album that most people usually laud.  &quot;New York Serenade&quot; is like West Side Story in a single song (with better dancing because you have to imagine it, not watch it).  &quot;Kitty's Back&quot; and &quot;Rosalita&quot; are delerious with the joy of being alive, young and misbehaving.  <br />The E Street Band was still a bar band at this point and had not acquired the rock-steady drumming of Max Weinberg.  Vinnie Lopez is all over the place and it is especially noticeable if you ever to try to actually dance to this recording of &quot;Rosalita&quot;.  Miami Steve is not yet present and Springsteen plays all the guitars, which are pretty impressive although I more for exuberance than for technical reasons.  I appreciate exuberance much, much more than technical accomplishment.  This isn't jazz.  It is supposed to be a lot of fun.  And it is.
014028009X|4.0|The heroine is as lovable as they come, and the story is always amusing as we watch poor Bridget blush again and again. Triumphant story of hopelessly vain Singleton, seeking to be self-assured and happy in an obstacle-course world of smugness. Makes you glad your life isn't as sad as hers, or if we're truly honest with ourselves, makes you glad you're not alone in your humiliations. Good for light, feel-good reading (summer).
B000002HMH|4.0|This is one of the albums that fans of early Metallica love to hate. They have many complaints about this album, the main one being that it is too light and that the songs are too groove-oriented. Although some of the songs on this album are definitely skipworthy, Metallica tries something new with mixed results. Below is a brief highlights review, followed by the reason they really had to make this album.<br />Overall, this album isn't a hard rocker start to finish as many Metallica albums are. However, the highlights are tracks 4-7 and 14. One of those tracks from 4-7, &quot;Hero of the Day&quot; sounds absolutely positively mainstream, but it is still a good song. Track 7 is a return to the rock epics for Metallica, as &quot;Bleeding Me&quot; clocks in at 8:18 and is a great song. And of course, the last track is the longest song they've ever attempted that's by them. &quot;The Outlaw Torn&quot; is one killer of a track, and I love the storyline that is involved in this 9:53 masterpiece. Among the remaining, some are solid and some are..well, not so solid which is why this mixed bag receives an average rating of 3 stars. At 78:59, it is tied with Tool's &quot;Lateralus&quot; as the longest album in my collection. However, I upped the star rating one to counter a little bit the wasted negative 1-star reviews.<br />Now, here's the story. Metallica needed to make this album. Back in 1991, when they decided to break the mainstream with &quot;The Black Album,&quot; hair metal was just beginning to fade out. Even though the lyrics were generally inane, it was some heavy stuff at times and therefore Metallica could still get away with making heavy stuff to counter the mainstream. However, in 1991 a groundbreaking 2nd album was released by a Seattle trio that may be familiar to you. This new fad of grunge music was quite a bit lighter than hair metal. Then, when the lead singer of this group of guys from Seattle died in 1994, even LIGHTER music, alternative, stepped in to take its place. As a result, a lot can happen in five years; and in 1996 when Metallica released &quot;Load&quot;, they couldn't afford to crank out another heavy metal album. They would be perceived as too heavy for that time period. So, instead, they stuck to heavy alternative with a wishwash of influences finding their way into the music. In 1997, when they released &quot;Reload&quot;, alternative music was still the trend. However, they said their upcoming album, which is to be released in late 2000-early 2001, is going back to their thrash roots. But the reason is because they can afford to, because now rap-metal is (usually) slightly heavier again. This is what happens when a band breaks the mainstream. So get used to it. I used to be in your category, until I saw why these albums had to be made. Then I understood and sympathized with these guys.<br />Definitely don't start with this though, unless the heaviest thing you listen to is alternative. However, still a stellar work from a group that had to make a change. Maybe their worst, but not all that bad.
B00001NFCY|4.0|I love this CD and I love Creed, so don't get me wrong, but the single complaint I have is how they will say 1 line a couple billon times in a song. But besides that, the songs are great. My favorites are Higher, What if, Say I, Beutiful, and Wrong Way. They have a very strong voice and it sounds as though he cares what he sounds like more than other bands. I suggest buying this CD today and listen a few days nonstop. It's really cool.
B00003CXP1|5.0|I bought this movie, it took me two long days to watch this movie, and I'll never watch it again.  It was brilliantly done, and it hit you hard.  Just amazing.
0679735909|3.0|Although Possession starts out rather slowly and also in a complicated manner (as far as character and plot development), the second half of the book redeems Byatt's abilities.  She possesses a sensational ability to fuse the past with the present. Her talents are revealed through the use of poetry, letters, and prose. I found myself, after 500 pages, sad to put it down.
B000002N3N|5.0|This is my very favorite Enya album to date. Even writing a review of it will not come close to my inner feelings about its music. The first song, the title track &quot;The Memory of Trees&quot;, is the most beautiful song I've ever heard. From quiet strings to layered voices and shy piano to an orchestral-sounding climax with percussion and complex vocal parts, this song is gorgeously triumphant. &quot;Anywhere Is&quot; is a catchy but beautiful song that brings to mind wandering through a maze. Another highlight of the album is &quot;Pax Deorum&quot;. The first time I heard it, I thought of a group of hooded figures in a dimly-lit temple performing a ceremony. Enya shows off her low range with this piece. It is also interesting that she combines two different languages with two different religious ideas: the polytheism of the Romans (the Latin part) and the monotheism of the Christians (the Irish Gaelic part). Another tidbit: The Irish Gaelic part in &quot;Pax Deorum&quot; uses the same melody and text as the following, breathtaking piece, &quot;Athair ar Neamh&quot;. Being Catholic (a Christian denomination), I am sure that this song (whose title translates into &quot;Heavenly Father&quot;) has a personal meaning for Enya. &quot;From Where I Am&quot; is also another beautiful but quiet song, an emotion-packed instrumental. Enya certainly proves that you can be very quiet but still display strong feelings. From the joy of &quot;China Roses&quot; to the tranquility of &quot;Tea-house Moon&quot; and the expectantcy of &quot;On My Way Home,&quot; _The Memory of Trees_ is one of Enya's most wonderful works. I strongly recommend (and LOVE) this album. Brilliant!
B00004ZAV3|5.0|This is such a great contemplation of songs for such a great band.  However, there is so much more magic to the Beatles than what this CD has to offer, so those who buy this CD are only getting a small spoonful of the Beatles.
B00005ARDC|5.0|Seeing the slow decline of rock as a reputable genre within music&#8217;s ever expanding categories is somewhat depressing, and yet, at the same time completely understandable.  With so few awe inspiring acts these days I lay no blame at the feet of the masses gathering in front of pops catchy jingles.  With the millions buying Limp Bizkits latest album and getting caught up within the cheesy guitar riffs and horrible drumbeats we can almost forgive the consumers their desire to fit into some American rock heritage.  Yet, with MTV labeling Fred Derst as the new poster child for rock and roll, and so many accepting this image is inexcusable. Rock and roll never had dance tunes that lyrically imitate the hokey pokey as does Limp Bizkits song Rollin.  So to help bring this confusion to an end I went in search of a band that would have done the late Jim Morrison credit, and came up with Black Rebel Motorcycle Club.  Three guys from San Francisco decked out in tight leather jeans with studded leather jackets, a style that in itself resembles the old rock legends of old.  Their sound comes across as a Velvet Underground, Joy Division with a little bit of Dylan thrown into the mix. Whatever Happened to My Rock and Roll a clever parody written with parenthesized words &#8220;punk song&#8221; thrown at the end of the title, creating the image of angry rockers who know the soul of rock still exists within true music lovers.  Their anti-Christian song, a staple in any rock bands play list, White Palm is a wonderful example as to why rock once demanded so much attention. Now don&#8217;t get the impression that these leather-wearing musicians don&#8217;t have anything new to offer.  The large tonal canvas they create gives the vocals a dark background in which to form, and the bass player is allowed to be a key component with his catchy bass lines that almost overshadow the guitar. Keyboard usage is also an important aspect to this bands originality.  Used to help support the melancholy guitar and the weeping bass, yet not overpowering the vocals that are so well integrated instead of thrown in as an afterthought. All together a band that does not have to have a hit single or mass appeal to stand out from its lacking brethren.
B000050XEI|4.0|I absolutly love this CD.  It has a heavenly fresh sound to it that brings serinity to my mind when I listen to it.  It brings peaceful thoughts to my head such as looking at clouds or laying in flowers.  This CD is a great de-stresser, and it's especially ideal for things such as practicing yoga or for playing in your car during rush hour traffic.  It's also musical enough that you could listen to it and get some musical enrichment from it.  The only thing that kept me from giving the album a fifth star is the fact that her album is layed down just like some of her others, beggining with a beautiful piano ballad, and well, if you listen to Enya, you know the rest.  However, in this album, Enya experiments with more sounds wrapped in her music, making it richer than usual.  Definitly a great buy!
0060920386|5.0|The dot-com stock market insanity of 1999, followed by the dot-bomb fall in 2000, is eerily mirrored in this book from a decade earlier about big money, big egos, and raging insanity.<br />Burroughs and Helyar tell the story of the leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco in gripping fashion, showing how greed and shortsightedness contributed to the biggest and worst-managed corporate takeover in history.  The players:  Salesman F. Ross Johnson of RJR vs. Henry Kravitz of KKR.  Everything from a wild, rip-roaring potboiler novel is here:  Secret deals, stock market manipulation, flouting of laws, surprise plot twists.  All of it almost unbelievable, but all of it true.<br />The next time you wonder about how people could have been taken in by internet companies with insane stock prices who blew through venture capital as if it were funny money, read this book.  It's well worth your time, effort, and energy.
B00005B6N7|1.0|As bad movies go U-571 tops the charts. A American Submarine crew has to find a way to board and overtake a German U-boat, and bring back a crucial secret-code transmitter. It turns out to be more difficult than they expect. Agreeably old-fashioned WW2 submarine drama starts with a bang and but holds little interest throughout, then fizzling out at the end.  The film has no historical facts in it and has been described by many as an outrage, as it simply steals the true hero's glory. <br />We are introduced to Captain Andrew Tyler, who has just found out that he did not receive the position of captain as he had hoped. His commander, Lieutenant Commander Mike Dahlgren, feels he does not have what it takes to be a captain at this point, and that his emotional connection to his shipmates would prevent him from putting them in situations of potential danger. <br />Soon, our men are on their sub, heading out to sea, where they encounter the German submarine, take the crew hostage, and swipe the Enigma and code book to bring back to the attention of the U.S. Armed Forces. However, the German sub that responded to their call for help destroys the American sub, killing the German hostages and some Americans, leaving the rest of the crew on the German sub with Tyler as their captain. As their special ops mission turns into a race for survival, Tyler must make the right decisions in order to keep his crew alive and ship afloat as they near hostile waters on their way to safety. <br />The plot of the story follows a pretty basic pattern that is intensified by the suspense of the action sequences and the way in which Mostow works his magic with the camera. I found myself guessing what was going to happen in certain scenes of the movie, mainly because after seeing the trailer, I knew there was more that had to happen than just allowing the sub to sink and the Germans to win. And as much as the story does for its characters and their will to survive, I knew that the script wouldnot shortchange them in the long run. This really doesn't hinder the story, though; it still has a lot to offer. <br />Mostow has done a masterful job in creating an atmosphere that is tightly cramped and perilous all at the same time. The lighting used for the insides of the sub is merely the lights actually shown, not offscreen, giving it an authentic and real feel. The crew finds themselves huddled tightly together at times during sequences in which depth charges are deployed to harm the ship, which adds to the sense of small space while also keeping us at bay with the question of whether or not the vessel will make it through the treachery of the explosions. The depth charges provide the most ominous threat to the vessel, which is carried out on film in a most intense manner. The first set of explosions takes place outside of the vessel, where we can see everything that's going on, while the second set keeps us inside the sub so that all we can do is hold our breath with the crew and wait for the explosions to end. <br />The fact that the movie can set up this kind of connection is a testament to its brilliance. Mostow is able to bring us into the movie with the characters, giving us bird's-eye views of the action as well as taking us right into the middle of it. Either way, the effect is truly awesome, showing us a different kind of warfare that can be just as intense and terrifying as hand-to-hand and firearm combat on land. When the movie was over, I felt jolted and out of breath; the movie simply delivers the goods. <br />The visual and sound effects also help to bring us into the movie's rich canvas as well. Miniatures and life-size vessels were used in the filming of the actual submarine, and while the effects that surround it may be digitized, it helps to have something that is real to harness the look and acuity of the shot. The sound design and use of the elements available is tremendous and pleasing, with a low bass frequency playing pretty much throughout the entire movie to create a sense of tension. This is one of those big, loud effects movies that, even if you don't care for the story, will please on its visuals and sound alone. <br />Casting is an important factor in bringing out the emotion and depth, and this one, an all-star ensemble, does just that. Matthew McConaughey is the ambitious Lieutenant Andrew Tyler, who is the strongest of the characters. He is portrayed as earnest in his endeavors to save his crew, while keeping the movie from degenerating into a blatant effects show. Harvey Keitel is Chief Klough, a pivotal character who advises and aides Tyler in some pretty tight situations. He keeps Tyler from losing his cool, which is important for the movie. Bill Paxton plays Lieutenant Dahlgren, and while his character has little screen time, he does well in keeping us informed of the events at hand. Jake Weber is a convincing Lieutenant Hirsch, who knows everything about the mission and plays his character with integrity and intelligence. <br />One of the better war films to come out of Hollywood, &quot;U-571&quot; follows an intense and gripping storyline that delivers the goods to even those who don't follow the war film trend. Under the direction of Jonathon Mostow, who also directed the thriller &quot;Breakdown,&quot; the film contains a stellar cast that knows what it's doing and superb visual and sound effects that add to the atmosphere of suspense.
B000050HTO|4.0|...here and there that make it feel like walking with a pebble in your shoe forever, for what is not included (or included).  Ugh, missed the bull's-eye, Sony.  Sorry.     This can serve as acceptable primer on Bob Dylan for the neophyte, I guess.  But it is fatally, ever-so-naggingly flawed for the inexcusable and unacceptable omission of the much-beloved &quot;She Belongs To Me&quot;.  The evidence of Dylan's sense of humor needed to balance collection's like these, which often end up being too solemn in a worshipful sense, and thus less joyful than they should be, would have been corrected had &quot;She Belongs To Me&quot; been here.  His sense of humor humanized his work, and brought his image down to earth among fans and made it more psychological accessible to listeners; and so that aspect is not served here.  I want to enjoy and appreciate Dylan, but the too serious worshipful air created by the chosen sequence doesn't serve his image or legacy as well, if this is someone's only purchase, such as a newcomer may opt for.I hope it was not x'ed-out of the final list for the &quot;Quinn The Eskimo&quot; inclusion.  And that is the fly in the good ointment for me.  And I wouldn't have minded seeing if some scuttling and squeezing elsewhere might have made room for the essential &quot;Every Grain of Sand&quot;, but on this latter point, I know, that would be asking a lot.   Maybe they should have produced two double-discs (separately packaged) worth of songs, labeling them Essential Bob Dylan, Volume 1 and Volume 2 respectively, even though, Lord knows (and all below) there are already a lot of repackages already.  This cannot be definitive and at the same time, a comfortable and confident overview for me, so I would advise going for the first box set, Biograph - although, sure, it is the current best way to pick up &quot;Things Have Changed&quot;, admittedly.  It has that going for it.  Maybe no one could properly pick for his whole career on 2 discs, but it wouldhave made for a guilt-free, or more whole-hearted recommend with &quot;She Belongs To Me&quot; in there.  Bob, how could you allow one of your own beloved exercises to be excluded?  If this is truly a limited-edition, then &quot;Bringing It All Back Home&quot;, which we all should own, would have nothing to fear, sales-wise.
B000002AGB|4.0|After wearing out a copy of the Live at Leeds remaster (not true, but you get the idea), I figured I'd give their IOW cd a try; knowing that this is was one of the best live bands of all time, how bad could it be?<br />In actual fact, it's a solid live album, and like most of the other reviewers, the tunes from Tommy performed here are worth owning, but the band takes a bit too long to get into their groove, and Moon's drumming on the first 4 songs is pretty awful, by their own previously set standards.<br />I don't doubt that it was probably a fantastic show to attend, but Live at Leeds is the stronger album, in both performance and sound quality.  This album sort of catches them on the way down, and while they still had a long way yet to fall by 1970, it's not an essential live recording.  Anybody that tells you so is likely a die-hard fan, and as such, their opinion is too biased to give you honesty.
0793518326|5.0|This is the book that all musical Beatles fans (at least those who can read music) have been waiting for.  Every song the Beatles ever recorded on album or single.  Very accurate, though I have found a few miniscule errors, and easy to read.  The inclusion of tablature for guitar and bass is a big plus.    The only problem with this book is something the authors had no control over, and that is the many sound effects the Beatles used that are impossible to transcribe on a musical staff.  For example, the transcription of John Lennon's sound collage, called \\"Revolution 9\\", is almost unintelligible.  Of course, \\"Revolution 9\\" is also impossible to perform on stage.    ***A must-have for any Beatles fan who can play and read music***
B00002R0MC|5.0|Songs of Freedom should stand as a blue-print for all anthologies and box sets henceforth. To say this collection represents an accurate cross-section of Bob Marley's work is a gross understatement. The selections range from The Wailers earliest efforts under the deft production of Lee &quot;Scrath&quot; Perry to Marley's last concert appearence in Italy, 1980. Even if you own all the Island/Tuff Gong releases and the Trojan Records LP's, you've simply got to have this collection. It be da real ting mon. It don't git no bedder den dis. Peace, Respect and Ire Mon.
B000002AGB|5.0|Most People Think That Live At Leeds is better than this album, they're right, but what's wrong with listening to a raw live Who Album and especially at a festival, no not Woodstock (yet...), but Isle Of Wight is just as good. So their live Tommy is seperated between the two discs, so what! At least there is a live Tommy (that was until there was a Live At Leeds Deluxe). There are alot of cool jams on here worth to listen to, like John Entwistle's \\"Heaven and Hell\\", \\"Water\\", \\"Tommy Overture\\", \\"We're Not Gonna Take It\\", \\"Shakin' All Over/Spoonful/Twist And Shout\\", and \\"Substitute/My Generation/Naked Eye/Magic Bus.\\" I won't say that it is an important album to buy for any Who Fan, but if you do decide to buy it, it's good to hear.

B000002572|5.0|I feel as if I've bitten off a little more than I can chew trying to do justice to undeniably, one of the most important albums of all time - but here we go. It isn't often that a person's life is actually changed by a band, let alone a single album by a band, or even more ironically an album by a band by the name of that same band (!) but that is the case here with the monumental album by Boston based band &quot;Boston&quot; ironically entitled: &quot;Boston&quot;. I had been to Boston as a child in order to visit the Liberty Bell with my parents, only for my parents to realize that the Liberty Bell was actually in Philidelphia, which kinda sucked, but that visit stuck in my mind for the rest of my life because we went to a Red Socks game and some other stuff....anyway, I always had a special place in my heart for 'Boston' often telling my friend about the trip I went to in my youth. Imagine my delight when one day I saw the name 'Boston' on the cover of a record at a local music store - I was beside myself with glee and purchased it outright with money ear-marked for gas for the week, but so be it - and I have never looked back -- IN FACT THERE IS ACTUALLY A SONG ON THE ALBUM CALLED: &quot;DON'T LOOK BACK&quot;!!!!!!!!! how about THAT irony?<br />The album was everything I could have hoped for, flawless from start to finish - aural ambrosia - no two ways about it. I quickly became so enamored of this album that I began to collect as many rare and unusual copies of it as possible. One time I actually found a mint condition first pressing with the name &quot;Shutlz&quot; in black marker across the front - it cost me $150 (at the time) but I figured it was well worth it [I later was confused by the misspelling of Tom Scholtz's name and after asking the proprieter about this he explained that it was actually the autograph of John Banner who played the part of &quot;Schultz&quot; on Hogan's Heroes, which I thought was kind of a rip-off, but the guy wouldn't give me mymoney back and gave me $30 worth of credit instead with which I bought Sweet's &quot;Desolation Boulevard&quot; and Foghat's &quot;Fool for the City&quot;, but I was still felt ripped off, and haven't been back since].<br />Anyway -Rock on!
6303855474|4.0|i don't know why,but the first time i watched it i was like &quot;dang,i hate this movie&quot;but the second time it was much more interesting.Rob Shneider was very funny in this movie.this really has no plot but a lot of action.
0783225903|1.0|I am a BIG fan of British humor, but I found this movie to be a muddled, totally unfunny mess. It was all I could do to watch it through to the end, scratching my head the entire time and waiting in vain for it to get good. I wouldn't watch it again on a bet.
6305665753|5.0|this is definately one of the best stallone movies i have ever seen.the arm wrestling tournament was very good.i don't know what to say just go see it
0793518326|5.0|I am a good fan of the Beatles and believe me when I tell you that this is a very good book for those who like Beatle music and want to play it. I have some other songbooks of the fab four but this is the best. It is the only one that has all the songs reordered by the fab four and in the key played on the records. Complete transcriptions for all the instruments. It has chords, guitar tabs, drum scores, vocal lead sheet and scores for piano and other instruments when used. You will enjoy it. It could be used not only to learn the tune it is helpful for musical analysis for the Beatles songs and having all the instruments can be used for making arrangements (including solo playing), to play it with a band, to understand the other instruments performance, deduct some arranging techniques, etc. The only thing that is not so good about this book is that the print is a bit small, but perfectly readable.    Excelente libro, muy completo, tiene todas las canciones y una trascripción exacta de todos los instrumentos. Mejor compra que otros libros de los Beatles ya que tiene absolutamente todas las canciones y una trascripción completa de la obra a diferencia de otros libros como Fake Books o los de tipo P/V/C que solo tienen arreglos simples de piano, la línea melódica y acordes. Esto es conveniente porque puede utilizarse este libro como Fake Book o incluso para extraer versiones en piano solo (o cualquier otro instrumento), pero también permite conocer la interpretación del instrumento tal cual fue grabada, así que es muy útil a la hora de tocar en conjunto. A mi me fue útil incluso para hacer análisis musicales de ciertas canciones y deducir técnicas de arreglo y composición. Muy recomendable.
B00004TL21|5.0|that's what you'll be saying once the final track of the cd is done.You wont be able to skip any track cause this cd has more hit's then a hokey game during the playoff's. my fave song's have to be change (in the house off fly ) this is one song that will have you singning the lyric's way after the song is over, then there is ex-queen wich is such a treat for your ear hole's &amp; digital bath wich like the previous song's i mentionned are great to listen to &amp; enjoy i cant see a person not owning this cd (white pony)anything other then this would be uncivilized.

0679879269|1.0|Disgusting. Just disgusting. This book is a big, BIG let-down, but not because it was poorly written. No no no, this book could have been great...if it haddn't been full of [stuff]. The author obviously doesn't know a thing about the Catholic church, because this book is chock full o' errors. This book is a huge insult to my religion, and it makes me sick. The first two in this series were good, but suddenly something went wrong. I am not in the habit of doing this, but I burned this book, because this sort of filth should be destroyed.

079072961X|5.0|Dr. Richard Kimble claims that he is not responsible for his wife's murder.  Despite his proclamation of innocence, no one believes him.  Harrison Ford portrays this doctor, who soon becomes a fugitive from the law.  Ford's character journeys around Chicago in a desperate attempt to search for the actual killer and prove his innocence.  However, his quest is difficult due to the fact that he has US Marshals attempting to capture him and bring him to justice.  Tommy Lee Jones has the role of US Marshal Sam Gerard, who is persistent as he tries over and over again to capture the fugitive.  Despite his relentless attempt to find the doctor, Ford's character manages to keep one step ahead of the marshals since he always manages to find an escape route.  Chicago provides the background for this movie, and the camera follows Dr. Kimble as he runs through the sewers with the deputy in hot pursuit.  This is just one example of this entertaining, action packed film.

B00000JCOV|1.0|All there is on this album is disorganized tuneless NOISE. No artistry, no lyrical meaning, just lots and lots of NOISE. NOISE NOISE NOISE. Slipknot makes me sick with thisr idiotic posturing, saying that they are the &quot;voice of thisr generation&quot; and that they are &quot;leading the revolution against nu-metal.&quot; In reality they are the epitome of nu-metal: marketed to the demographic of inartictulate, mentaly and emotionally deficent 13-19 year old males living in suburbam America, looking for a way to scare their parents and appear different from theit peers. Aside from that, the &quot;music&quot; is just AWFUL, and I am a big fan of other REAL metal bands like Pantera, older Metallica, and Megadeth. Get any of those band's albums and dont pour any more of your hard earned $$$ into the faceless money making machine that is Nu-metal and Slipknot. NOISE NOISE NOISE NOISE NOISE NOISE NOISE NOISE NOISE.............
B00003CXHJ|2.0|This movie is about an American raid on a German U-boat to gain possesion of the enigma code machine. As with all American blockbusters the Americans were depicted as the clean-cut, good looking 'nice guys' and the Germans were shown as the scruffy in-breeds. I am sick of these movies, therefore U-571 did not go down very well.  There is also a few historically incorrect pieces of information displayed in this movie.<br />1. The Americans were not involved in war during this time. 2. The British were the ones that captured the enigma machine.<br />Overall. i did not really enjoy this movie as it was hard to follow, boring, historically incorrect and American.<br />PS. Do not see tomb raider........big waste of time.
B00000331V|5.0|Am I the only person who sees the incredible irony that, sadly, dogged the J. Geils Band?<br />Though they had a few modest hits over the years (like &quot;Give it to Me&quot;, which is given a fiery workout on this disc), the band spent most of its career laboring in relative obscurity. That eventually changed, thanks to the more pop-oriented sound they adopted with &quot;Love Stinks&quot;, &quot;Angel in the Centerfold&quot; and &quot;Freeze Frame&quot;. <br />How then can nonsense like the Blues Brothers be explained? With the same formula the Geils band perfected years earlier - a devotion to classic rhythm and blues - those characters became media icons. In a better world the J. Geils Band would have gotten there first.<br />&quot;Blow Your Face Out&quot; is one of those live documents that shows just how good a band can be when, in front of a wild audience, they fire on all cylinders and deliver the goods. Kicking off with \\"Southside Shuffle\\", and running through a generous set list of fine originals and reverent covers, the J. Geils Band takes no prisoners on this collection. <br />J. Geils finally got the brass ring (albeit but with much fluffier material), but this disc showcases a band that could shake it without breaking it.
0385484518|5.0|I am convinced that this book is one of the few books, that I can say with confidence, has something in it for everyone. It is very difficult for me to understand why so many people are into fiction stories, when you have nonfiction like this, that is every bit as gripping as any fictional tale. I would like to mention that, in my opinion, there can be found more context that contain elements that are compelling to the mind in true life than in fantasy land. This is that `true life' that I am referring to.<br />It is true however that many people can relate better to fiction than real life. That is not hard to see when life is so twisted and alienating. Tuesdays With Morrie is an exception that is welcomed and overdue.<br />This is a great story, true life, that is engaging, heartbreaking, and heartwarming all at the same time. This story is well written, easy to literally digest yet hard at times to emotionally stomach. It is the story of life written under the context of death, therefore it is most revealing in that `too close for comfort' kind of way. This book is a great teacher in many different ways. I cannot see how someone would not like the story as it is central to existence here on this planet.<br />What I loved the most about this story is that we come away from it with that feeling that death is not something to fear. I had entertained thoughts that I had never considered before I read this book. I am grateful to have been exposed to this book for all its wisdom and meaning. For its ability to relate to me and my fears.<br />Tuesdays With Morrie is a very rare and exceptional book because its characters portray their exceptional lives and the transition of life in real time.
0553577123|5.0|It's hard to put into words the feelings I am left with after having finished reading this book.  There were moments during reading it when I laughed, when I was sad, and times when I felt angry.  To look back on this time, a time before I was even born, and to see how people could have treated one another, almost leaves me with a sick feeling inside.  To look how people still treat one another, what with racism, discrimination, and with apathy still, only increases that feeling.  And yet, with reading Anne's words, and feeling her optimism still for the future, with all that had happened, I have to still believe that we as a people can change, and become better beings.<br /> I had seen the \\"Diary Of Anne Frank\\" as both a play, and as a movie before I had sat down to read the book.  The movie was all right, but I liked the play more, mainly because the girl who portrayed Anne was closer to her own age, somewhere around the age of fifteen.  Knowing what the ultimate end of her story would be had always kept me from reading the book, until I decided to just go ahead and read it.  And now I am glad that I did.<br /> Anne had a unique style of writing, wherein no matter how normal what she was writing about might have been, that I always found myself interested.  She had depth, a real love for life, which really came through in her writing.  Maybe it was the fact that she yearned for a close friend that she could tell anything to, and made that friend her diary, and called it Kitty that made it so interesting.  Because of that, she wrote in her diary as if she were talking to a person instead of just an object, and put down to paper her true feelings and thoughts.<br /> At times, she seems almost prophetic when she is writing about the dreams she had about them being captured, and sent away to camps.  But then, I would have to stop and think, and realize that they lived with this fear every day they were in hiding, because they could never know what might give them away.  To imagine living with such a fear for almost two and a half years is almost beyond my belief.  And then, some of her entries in her diary were amusing, like when she told the story about one of their helpers creeping down the attic steps in his socks, and taking fifteen minutes to do so so that no one will hear him.<br /> I have to wonder what her life could have been like had she managed to survive, if she and the others hadn't been discovered hiding in the secret annex.  But then, maybe we wouldn't know her story as well as we do if that hadn't happened.  It's a sad truth that tragedy is more often better received than victory is.  Still, it would have been interesting to have seen what she could have accomplished, whether she could have realized her dreams of becoming a journalist, if things had been different.<br /> Many things have stayed with me since I finished reading the book, but none so much as her entry dating April 5, 1944.  She writes about her own writing, noting that she is her own best and harshest critic.  She goes on to say that she doesn't want to lead an ordinary life, she doesn't want to live a life in vain like most people.  She wants to be useful and bring enjoyment to all people, even those she has never met.  And finally, she says that she wants to go on living, even after her death!  That touched me like nothing else had.  She has gone on living even after her death, through this diary, which I, and many other people like me, have read.  If you haven't read it yourself, I encourage you to do so.  Anne was a remarkable girl, and I can only hope that some day the world can find the peace that she so desperately sought..

6305609705|5.0|On the last day of shooting, Francis Coppola stood before the entire cast and crew and said, \\"I've never seen so many people so happy to be unemployed.\\"<br />The film itself is true art, an exploration of the thin line that seperates genius from the insane--but the movie is so closely grounded in the system that we are familiar with (i.e. Hollywood), that it's overshadowed, labeled and marketed as a \\"Vietnam War Epic.\\"<br />Most complaints I hear are about how it drags through the third act.  The great, enormous battle sequence with Col. Kilgore at \\"Charlie's point\\" is almost totally out of proportion with the rest of the movie--but is so well done that some may find it a bit of a letdown when another stunning action sequence doesn't materialize.  I think this is a rather shallow way of looking at it, since the emotional journey is really what this movie centers around, and when Willard is inside the Kurtz compound--those are some the most emotionally intense moments I've ever seen put to film.<br />Apocalypse Now is based loosley upon the Joseph Conrad novella, \\"Heart of Darkness,\\" which should encourage you to dig a bit deeper into the film to witness the awsome power and scope of the journey Captain Willard takes with his intrepid river boat companions.<br />Francis Coppola and Marlon Brando both lost their minds after making this film.  Martin Sheen begged his son Charlie not to do \\"Platoon\\" for fear he wouldn't be able to handle the intensity that gave his father a heart attack on the set.  Robert Duvall found Jesus.  I think it's safe to say that this is one powerful motion picture.<br />As for the DVD, I liked it--though I would have really enjoyed a compilation of this movie and \\"Hearts of Darkness,\\" the documentary that Coppola's wife shot about all the work that went into the production of this film.  Also, the only director commentary was for an extra piece of footage not used in the film.  That is somewhat disappointing, but not enough to keep me from giving this movie 5 stars.
B00005BJPO|5.0|Do yourself a favor and buy this movie.  Do yourself another favor and watch it in Japanese.  The first 15 or so times I watched this film it was in Japanese.  I don't know Japanese, but the origonal translation was so bad it took away from the overall experience.  This is a must have DVD.
B00000JCOV|1.0|I used to love this a lot, I mean A LOT. It was like my bible. I was all like, 'yeah, the cursing just expresses what he feels' but now, I'm a little wiser, and bands like Thursday and Cursive can effectively display their anger without resorting to insane cursing or such musical lows. Although the music is undoubtedly catchy, it just seems so...pathetic. I mean, they have NINE members. They can do a lot more. Incubus has one DJ and he wipes the floor with the two DJ's Slipknot have, who don't even do much. And the guitarists, for lack of a better word, [...stink]. And the bassist might as well not be in the band. The lyrics are okay, but too profane and derivative to be enjoyable. I feel like all those times I defended Slipknot was wasted time. Maybe not. It was just a phase, which is what Slipknot is to the fullest. I don't want to say anything too negative, like \\"this is whats wrong with music today\\" but its kind of true. Terrible lyrics and mundane music. For some good nu-metal, listen to Nonpoint.
6305363668|1.0|I only saw Blade Runner because it's my dad's favorite movie, and I got it for him for Father's Day.  Anyhow, we ordered pizza and sat down to watch the Director's Cut of Blade Runner.  As the movie started, I was like &quot;okay, this isn't so bad after all,&quot; but I quickly took back my optimistic thought process.  It was a depressing 2-dimensional action/sci fi flick about... well, what was it about?  I don't know if anybody's sure about it.  Another mystery.<br />Anyway, Rachael, the replicant object of Deckard's affection, has no personality whatsoever.  I seriously wonder how he fell in love with her.  Maybe he's a replicant too... and, miraculously, that's the amazing question the movie is asking.  There is some deep meaning in this film.  Is it that Deckard is perhaps a replicant too?  Wow.  Too hard to handle, for me at any rate.<br />Most of the film I didn't get, including the white-haired replicant guy who ran around howling with a nail through his hand.  He was extremely creepy, if not completely repulsive.  The only part in the movie that I enjoyed was the 10-second-long vision of the unicorn.  At least I think it was a vision.  It was neat, but I'm not sure how it fit into the story.  I also liked the end, because it was not really an ending at all, and because that meant the torture was over.  But I suppose this all has to do with some mind impediment that I suffer from.  After all, I'm just a moron with no taste for sci fi flicks, except of course for the coolest movie ever, Star Wars.  Well, I guess if you're like my dad, you'll enjoy Blade Runner.  And if you appreciate real plots and characters with emotions, then you won't like this movie at all.
6301607929|5.0|Some of the finest acting ever done on the silver screen happened in this film, Picnic.  William Holden portrayed a &quot;drifter&quot;, and there will never, can never be anyone who could make the character of a &quot;bum&quot;...a man without a job, money, car wardrobe, home, etc. appear so appealing,deeply faceted  and enticing.  He lends to his character Hal Carter, his own  untamed spirit, and that is the essence that emits throughout the story.  The beauty of it all is that every drifter is searching, but some never know for what it is that they search.  In Picnic, he finds Madge Owens, an honestly unassuming feminine beauty, Played so lovely  by Kim Novak.  This was a story of the sublime in the ordinary..no fancy sets, or wardrobe..just superb acting. Rosalind Russel was someone you must know from your own family or group of friends.  She and the other supporting actors areimpeccable in their art, during this film.  There is never one moment that they allow your attention to drift other than being with them, on that mid western Labor Day event, that fills  the air with the sweetness of late summer.  If I could choose to escape anywhere in my fantasy, I would want to be there with all of them, under the &quot;Moonglow&quot;, (the most exquisite music score.)  When they say this is the stuff dreams are made from...for me, it's &quot;Picnic&quot;.
B00003W8NM|4.0|This movie is perhaps the most twisted, mentally confusing movie since either Seven (another Brad Pitt mess-with-your-mind movie) or Clockwork Orange. Watch it just once, you miss more than half of the things going on in it.  I saw it twice in the theatres, and then bought the DVD the day it was available.<br />Every time you watch it, you see something new, or get a new insite. Edward Nortan plays one of the most convincing &quot;screwed-up&quot; characters in recent memory.  Brad Pitt....  well, I had lost hope for him after Seven, but he turns in a character performance worthy of being compared to Hannible Lector. A stretch? Not really.<br />As with Seven, do NOT watch this movie on a full stomach, or by yourself...  that is, unlsee you're into that sort of thing. :)
B000056K04|5.0|I was at first dissuaded to buy Everyday because of the negative feedback it was receiving, but being the dedicated fan that I am, I gave it shot and bought it.  Everybody couldn't have been more wrong!  I love the CD... I think it shows the band doing something a little different, and I applaud their taking the risk to put out some new kind of music out there.  My favorites include The Space Between, Fool to Think, and Sleep to Dream Her.  It's really a great CD if you simply listen to it with an open mind, not expecting what you think SHOULD be on it and just experience the new road that DMB has taken.

B00003CXAA|5.0|The Godfather is by far the greatest film ever made.  The drama and excitement of a mafia, but most importantly, of a family of Italian Americans who occasionally commit murder one.  The Godfather II continues the saga, and the torch has been passed, and Michael takes complete control.  The Godfather III is a touching conclusion, in which Pacino works for redemption for his family.  The Greatest.  This review is kept thin so that it will be read, and many important event were left out, and this doesn't even do it justice.  I am a godfather buff, and have awaited its release on DVD for quite some time now.  Definitely worth the cash, this souped up collection is better late than never.
0812550757|5.0|I read Ender's Game and loved it, so I decided to try this book.  It is very possibly better than Ender's Game, althought it is decidedly different.  And it is (unfortunately) much better than it's successor - Xenocide.  Orson Scott Card has written much more than sci-fi with this book, it also contains an impressive amount of interesting philosophical ponderings.<br />My advice: read it, but AFTER you read Ender's Game.  (The author claims that you don't have to read them in order, but it spoils &quot;Ender&quot; if you read &quot;Speaker&quot; first.)  Don't read the intro or even the back, just pick it up and read.  You won't be able to put it down.
0380789019|4.0|'Neverwhere' is a curious mix of comedy (think Terry Pratchett) and horror (think Clive Barker) where a befuddled London man is taken on a bizarre, fantastic journey (think Douglas Adams).  One can easily dismiss it as derivative nonsense.  Despite this lack of originality (.. Neil Gaiman even blatently &quot;borrows&quot; the idea of intelligent rats from books from Pratchett/Adams) the book makes for compulsive reading, especially for fans of London.<br />'Neverwhere' is a journey through the sewers and London Underground where an entirely alternative, and decidely creepy, reality exists.  We encounter the dregs of London life from the past several hundred years, along with some rather supernatural creatures thrown in for ... I don't why.  The story is, of course, ridiculous.  But the journey through London, both past and present, is fantastic.  Oh, and Neil Gaiman writes some very funny prose.<br />Bottom line: the perfect mild diversion for Pratchett fans, and a must read for Londoners.  The book doesn't take itself seriously; you will not confuse it with works by Dostoyevsky.
0060925000|4.0|I bought this book after hearing some good reviews of it. Yet I never imagined it would be THIS good.  Yes, its immense size is definitely intimidating. But after turning the last page, I sighed and realized that it was worth it.  I have never been so immersed in the lives of so many different characters at once. My absolute favorite character was Maan. I was completely drawn into his charming, flippant personality and the strength of his infatuation with the mysterious courtesan Saeeda Bai.  Admittedly, while reading I sometimes wished that he felt that way for me. Another favorite character of mine was the audacious Meenakshi Chatterji, whose personality I despised, but I kept reading just to find out what incredibly rude or self-centered thing she would do next. The intricate way Seth has connected these 4 families is entirely believable, and he makes each family stand out with the distinctive personalities of its members.   I gave this book 4 stars only because of the lengthy passages dealing with politics that were sometimes tedious to read, especially if you were involved in the action of other characters. However, these passages must at least be skimmed, because some of the main characters have important interactions that affect later events.  So they are somewhat of a necessary evil.  But no one can say that Seth did not use historically and legally accurate detail when writing these sections.  <br />I have truly never been so moved by a book.  The night I finished the book, I started reading at 10 PM. When I reached the climax, I found myself sobbing uncontrollably at 3 AM. At that point, I was so involved with the characters and events that I knew I wouldnt sleep until I finished the book. So when I finally reached the last page, my eyes still tearing, I looked up to see daylight. The way Seth wrote the climax and events immediately following, I felt the characters pain, worry, anger, and sorrow. It was indescribable.<br />In conclusion, A Suitable Boy isone of the best books I have ever read. It brought me into an amazing world, where I could hear the bustle of Brahmpur market and smell the blooms of Mrs Mahesh Kapoor's beautiful garden. Although a large reading project to undertake, it is one that will leave you utterly satisfied, as if you have just spent time with intimate friends.
B000005H4K|5.0|On this CD, Mrrs Duke Ellingon (1899-1974), Charlie Mingus (1922-79) and Max Roach (b1924) form a trio which sets the standard for all Jazz trios.  Recorded in 1962, MONEY JUNGLE is a landmark, a watershed of standards and new material.  From the soulful REM BLUES to the wild CARAVAN and MONEY JUNGLE.  My favourite is SWITCH BLADE because the three titans are engaging each other, pushing each other, and even mocking a bit.  All in good fun, though, which drives their competitive spirits.  But what do I know?  Mr George Wein (b1925), an accomplished jazz pianist, owner of the famous Storyline, a Boston Jazz mecca, and promoter of the Newport Jazz Festivals, writes &quot;To hear this album is to believe fully in the validity and lasting qualities of jazz.  Ellington displays the scope of four decades of musical experience.  He adroitly mixes the most advanced harmonic chords, a touch of stride piano, and Ellingtonia of the thirties and forties.  Mingus and Roach know their Ellington and perform as if this were a trio of longstanding.  But they add through their distinctive musical personalities a dimension never heard before in Duke's playing.  The combination makes this one of the greatest piano trio recordings in jazz history.&quot;  Ignore at your own risk.
0790733226|5.0|All of the greatest work by the greatest scientists has been done while they were very young, when they were stupid enough to believe that two-plus-two-equals-five, and pursued it instead of listening to all of those who were much older and wiser who said Don't Waste Your Time.  Einstein, it has been said, asked all of his important questions before the age of twenty-five, then spent the rest of his life working on them.  \\"Contact,\\" directed by Robert Zemeckis, is the story of a young scientist, Ellie Arroway (Jodie Foster), who like Einstein and all the greats before her, has been asking questions and seeking answers since she was very young.  And now, as a member of the SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) team, she is able to pursue her obsession with the mysteries of the galaxies and the infinite universe that surrounds us.  Her job is to sweep the skies, using the most sophisticated equipment available, for a signal from deepest space.  It may be her job, but for Ellie it's a labor of love, for she is convinced that there is something, or someone, out there somewhere, because otherwise, she reasons, what a terrible waste of space it would be.  Ellie may be a dreamer, but she knows in her heart that it is the dreamers who over the years have been responsible for making us evolve, making us learn and grow because they are the ones who take insane, foolish ideas and pursue them.  And to her, two-plus-two will always be five.<br /> Ellie loves her job and believes in what she is doing, but it's been a struggle over the years, as she and others have had to constantly fight for the funding necessary to keep the project alive, begging for dollars from short-sighted, unimaginative people with vision that goes only as far as the bottom line of their budget book.  It's been a tough row to hoe, and she's had to swallow a lot of pride over the years, but then one day it all pays off, when in one magic moment she hears what she's been waiting for all her life:  Asignal from a distant end of the galaxy-- someone attempting to communicate, to make contact, with the people of the Earth.  <br /> Ellie and her team soon realize that, whomever it is, they are using the universal language of prime numbers in their attempts at making contact; and when Ellie deciphers the code, she discovers something monumental in the bargain.  But it's a message of global importance, something much bigger than she and her team alone, and she soon find herself fighting to remain a part of the drama that is only beginning to unfold-- the first interaction between human beings and an alien life form.  And it's only the beginning of the adventure and the wondrous places this film is about to take you.<br /> Jodie Foster gives a performance here that demonstrates what a gifted, talented actor she is.  Her Ellie is convincing and believable, and someone to whom you can genuinely relate, no matter who you are or where you're from, because there is something universal in Ellie's passion and longing to discover the truth and to see beyond the veil of our limited mortal capacities.  There's a strength to Ellie, born of a combination of intelligence and innocence, as well as tenacity and faith, and Foster manifests all of these complexities of her character beautifully, with a performance that should've landed her an Oscar nomination.  In this role, she is simply as good as it gets.<br /> As the young Ellie, Jenna Malone gives a terrific performance, also, which certainly captures the same spirit that we find in the adult Ellie.  And there's a maturity she brings to the character that far exceeds her years.  She was a perfect choice for the part, and if this is any indication of what she is capable of, Malone has a successful career ahead of her.<br /> The supporting cast includes David Morse (Ted Arroway), Matthew McConaughey (Palmer), Geoffrey Blake (Fisher), William Fichtner (Kent), Tom Skerritt (David), James Woods (Kitz) and Angela Bassett (Rachel).  Zemeckis did a brilliant job of bringing this film to fruition, especially in the way he allowed Foster the time to really develop her character, by giving her that extra moment at just the right time that ultimately meant so much in the final analysis.  Too often it's those few minutes that wind up on the cutting room floor that make the difference between  a good film and an exceptional one; and between Zemeckis and Foster, they took it to the edge by taking some chances to realize that combined vision, which in the end made this a great film.  Thoroughly engrossing and entertaining, \\"Contact\\" will transport you to places you can only imagine, and it's all done with style and in a way that makes this a truly memorable cinematic journey.  It's what the magic of the movies is all about.
0140434135|5.0|I loved this book, and although I do admit to liking all of Jane Austen's novels, I think it is the best way for a non-Austen-fan to understand her wit and charm.  Her irony in this book is much more apparent than in the other five, except perhaps &quot;Emma&quot;.  It is short, and easy to get through, and her leading lady is endearing.  This was Austen's first novel, but wasn't published until later.  It is obvious that she still has much to learn, but her genius is still present, if a little raw.  A wonderful book.
B00005B4GU|4.0|I fell in love with this album as soon as I listened to it. I'm not very easy to please, and I just don't hand 4 star ratings. Following up &quot;KID A&quot; is a tough act, but the group pulled it off. Radiohead is like a group of scientists experimenting with music and pushing the envelope. What you will find on this album compared with &quot;KID A&quot; is deep, powerful songs like &quot;I Might Be Wrong&quot;, &quot;Packt Like Sardines&quot;, and &quot;You and Whose Army&quot; which I think are the best songs on the album. Also notable is the incredibly innovative &quot;Knives Out&quot; and incredible experience of the &quot;Pyramid Song.&quot; <br />What you won't find compared with &quot;KID A&quot;, is the apocalyptic sounds like &quot;Every Thing In It's Right Place&quot;. Also missing are the tracks that make you feel like your on a journey, like the title track &quot;Kid A&quot;.<br />Getting back to AMNESIAC, the only tracks that I couldn't feel are &quot;Like Spinning Plates&quot;, which I think they went to far and &quot;Life In A Glass House&quot; which other people like, but is too up-beat for my taste. That took away a star in my eyes because I feel they didn't finish the album on a good note.<br />Other than that, the captivating music is still hear with &quot;Morning Bell/Amnesiac&quot; which has a creepy feeling and the haunting sounds of &quot;Hunting Bears&quot;. But the most mysterious track is &quot;Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors&quot; which sounds like nothing before. This album is ground-breaking in many aspects and something everybody must have.
B00000I8UF|4.0|This was my introduction to Bu in my college days, and in retrospect it barely scratches the surface. For a follow-up, pick up the eponymous collection on Columbia with Mobley and Byrd. Also, be certain your Blakey collection generously represents, among trumpet players, Clifford, Kenny Dorham, Freddie Hubbard, and Bill Hardman (not to mention Wynton, Valery Ponomarev, and Terrence Blanchard). As for saxophonists, Golson, despite his compositional talents, is one of the lesser players to occupy that spot in a Blakey ensemble. Even when it comes to composers, if there's a \\"genius\\" among the Blakey contributors, it's Walter Davis, Jr. \\"Jodie,\\" \\"Ronnie's a Dynamite Lady,\\" \\"Backgammon,\\" \\"Uranus,\\" \\"Gypsy Folk Tales,\\" \\"Scorpio Rises\\"--these are all Davis compositions that Blakey saw fit to record, challenging, adventurous material that places Blakey in the forefront of modern, progressive music, a musicmaker beyond category, as opposed to being simply leader of jazz' foremost \\"hard bop\\" ensemble.<br /><br />It's not easy to find, but look for another \\"Moanin'\\" on Laserlight. Recorded live, it features Hardman playing the title song like there was no tomorrow along with a cadenza on \\"Blue Moon\\" that Freddie, who introduced the tune on \\"3 Blind Mice,\\" could have played only in his dreams. Another good introduction to Hardman's trumpet artistry is the Italian LP, \\"Art's Break,\\" on which Art stops the band while Bill plays for half a dozen choruses unaccompanied.<br /><br />That's jazz. That's the inexhaustible world of Art Blakey.
B00001MXXG|4.0|It was good and I know there's no love triangle.  But I have to admit, it did get sappy after Cameron destroyed the Ferrari.  I still love this movie though
0060278234|4.0|I truely enjoyed reading this book.  I bought it because I enjoyed his novel, Sabriel, so much.  I was not disappointed.  I found the main character, Lirael, to be believable and felt her fears, frustrations, and joys.  However, I rated this book only 4 stars because I personally don't like it when the story is clearly left hanging and incomplete.  I'll be surprised if there isn't another novel soon.
0393312836|5.0|This book is not for the week of heart.  However, it is a book for the strong of mind.  This book is way out there, and I mean WAY OUT THERE.  If you like such off the wall books as Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, than this book is for you.  Have fun, the book is real horrorshow, as Alex puts it! ;)
0064471837|5.0|Sabriel is categorized as a young adult book however, like Garth Nix's other books, is very engaging for adults.  Nix's character development is excellent as you get to know Sabriel and follow her quest to find her father, learn who she is and discover her inate talents and strength.  Nix has created a hard to put down book with this story that blends magic and fantasy with believable technology.
B00005A0N5|5.0|I borrowed this CD from a friend of mine at work.  I normally don't listen to his type of metal (he's into the hardcore gothic and death stuff).  Anyway, he had a note on it labelleing it &quot;Operatic Metal&quot;.  Decided to take a chance.  Boy, was I glad I did - this thing is spectacular!  Decided to pick it up immediately!<br />I don't know how to describe it other than some intelligent stuff, well written, catchy, and definitely NOT your standard stuff that falls under the label of &quot;metal&quot;.<br />I normally listen to stuff like Black Sabbath (I run black-sabbath.com), and stuff that falls under the category of 70's metal; the only metal to come out of the 80's that I truly liked was Queensryche &amp; Metallica.  This is the first new thing in a long time that I've had this kind of positive reaction to!<br />Highly recommended!
0380973650|4.0|Neil Gaiman has been on my list of &quot;must-buys&quot; since before his Sandman days.  His writing style has always been right on target and his lyrical myths have fascinated me from the word go. American Gods is another step on his way of becoming a household name -- however, he veers off course late in the game and never seems to get back on track. The characters stick with you but not quite in the same way as Door or the Marquis de Carabas did in Neverwhere.  As far as stories go, the two books couldn't be more dissimilar, but American Gods take a hard right into Stephen King territory about 200 pages in and never veers back into Gaimanland. All in all, it's an excellent book by an excellent author, but compared to his other works, it falls short -- Sorry.<br />But a mediocre book for Gaiman is heads and tails above the greatest book by most anyone else.<br />Buy it - Enjoy it - Read Stardust - Read Neverwhere - Be Happy.
B000056VIY|1.0|&quot;BUYER BEWARE&quot; for 2 reasons. <br />1. The albums stinks. The only song that is worth listening to is    PLAY, which brings us to reason number 2.<br />2. PLAY has some major curses in it. <br />This album will be purchsed and listened to by kids. Lopez's record company should have either deleted the words or placed a warning on the cover.<br />Fortunatly, I was able to return the album and get my money back. And if I didn't, oh well, as long as it was out of the house.
0375703764|5.0|Very enthralling.... make sure to have nothing important that has to be done for several days when you read this book.... You will not get anything done, but you will read this book. I have accomplished nothing save reading this book and working, I still continue to reread passages and make notes. In a word: Incredible....
B00003CXHJ|1.0|i don't know if you are but i am sick and tired of Americans changing history so they can cry and blow there nose on other countries national flags. U-571 was the same again. The movie should of been named &quot;Yanks are up themselves&quot; or &quot;We didn't do anything in the war so lets pretend we did&quot;.I also hate how the Americans are alwayus so clean cut and loyal and there opponments are rough, dirty and scraggy. Not that i am saying the the Germans where all well cut but there was not that bigger difference between the to opposing countries. For example the americans are all well shaven, well dressed and well stuck up themselves saying quotes like &quot;this enigma machine will make or break the war&quot; and &quot;we are doing this for America&quot; as they sail off into the sunset. but in comparresment not one German is shaven they all have scrappy cloths and are hidding at the depths of the sea. to end don't see it it messes with your mind
B00003CXDZ|5.0|I HAVE SEEN THIS MOVIE FIVE TIMES AND I HAVE LISTENED TO THE CD ALOT! AND I HAVE BOUGHT THE BOOK AND THE POSTERS, THIS MOVIE IS SO FULL OF COLOR AND MUSIC. IT IS DEFENTILY SPECTACULAR! SPECTACULAR! THE ACTING WAS GREAT ON BOTH PARTS FOR NICOLE AND EWAN! I LOVE THE SONGS IN THE MOVIE IT REALLY DOES MAKE YOUR HEART SINGS! IT BRINGS YOU INTO THE MOVIE AND MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE A CHARACTER IN THE MOVIE! SO IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE              YOU HAVE TO GO SEE THIS MOVIE!
B00003CXHJ|2.0|This film set out to make us pick sides, by using music, clothing, plot, and other tactics to pursuide us that the Americans are the &quot;good guys&quot; and the that the Germans are the evil enemys that have to be concured for the hope of man kind.<br />This film trys to make you feel that the clean cut Americans have to capture the enigma machine so that the world will be saved. They try to personalise it by seeing that the Luitenent fails to become a captain and that all the crew love him.<br />This film trys to makes the Germans out to be filthy and brutal by killig the survivers of the submarine which the blew up. The also made the Germans look bad by when the Americans let the Captain live, how he escapes and sabortages the sub.<br />Even the History is wrong, because it was the Britz that actually captured most of the enigmas and who also cracked the code not the &quot;brave&quot; Americans.<br />Over all this film decives ytou to make you believe that you should be baraking for the Americans 10 mins into the movie. it is a very crewl and deceptive film. I can not belive that such a lie was even let out on film let alone of Vidio and DVD.<br />P.S. I recomend to not watch this if you have not seen this before!!!
0440211727|5.0|This book is an excellent read. Very enjoyable. One of my favorite Grisham books. You will feel what the characters are feeling. Jake Brigance, the young lawyer, battles with an annoying D.A., his own client, the NAACP, and the Klan. This book is very exciting!
0782008364|5.0|This is a wonderful movie -- it's exciting and campy at the same time. It also looks really good, but if you look at it closely you realize that it was made really cheaply (which I find even more impressive). It was the first outing of the Wachowski brothers (who most recently have been making &quot;The Matrix&quot; movies), and stars Gina Gershon, Jennifer Tilly, and Joe Pantoliano, who all give excellent performances.<br />One of the treats of the DVD is to listen to the commentary track, which starts off fairly typically with the W. brothers and some crew (including the &quot;lesbian sex consultant&quot;) talking about the movie. However, the three leads show up about midway through (they were actually late!) and then the track is hilarious. Gershon and Tilly are a riot, and their remarks lead to revealing comments from the W. brothers and Pantoliano that I found both convulsively funny and fascinating. And I've never heard as spontaneous and honest a self-evaluation as Tilly talking about herself in some of these scenes.
0440224764|5.0|Exciting! Grisham's masterpiece. One of my favorites. Patrick takes 90 million from his firm and flees to Brazil. Patrick finds himself in the middle of the biggest scandal to hit the coast in years. YOU ABSOLUTELY CAN NOT PUT THIS BOOK DOWN.
B00003CXBK|5.0|I was one of the people who complained bitterly when this DVD was originally released w/o a Japanese track and English subs.  I loved the movie visually but hated, hated, hated the English dubbing and refused to buy the DVD. Thanks to Chasemouse, I have checked the specs again and now see that there is a Japanese track, so I have ordered the DVD.
B00003CX5P|2.0|What happened with that young director that some twenty one years ago presented us with a movie that sent our imagination soaring and that started one of the great cultural movements in the last century?<br />Well, he became  a greedy toy merchandiser planning to steal 8 bucks from you.<br />Instead of placing a milestone in film history Lucas gives a flick intended for the Nickelodeon audience, toddlers that will throw a tantrum so they can get the cute-cuddly-tickle me- Jar Jar, and he whole assortment of useless children toys, as well as the Watto fluffy slippers.<br />I know that he had to go for a young audience so he could continue the Star Wars phenomenon through the next generations, but he could have settled for aiming at +13 year olds, not for 4 and 5 year olds.<br />This movie has a completely dull plotline that starts running until some fifteen minutes before it ends, the acting (specially Jake Lloyd`s) is pretty lousy with some exceptions, and the only really good thing are the amazing special effects and soudtrack.<br />I ratted this DVD and it hasn`t even come out,and eventough I think it bites I will have to get it to complete my Star Wars collection.<br />I hope Episode 2 is a lot better (but again, I doubt it), and for telling you the truth I could have lived with only episodes IV, V, and VI.
0618135871|5.0|The Dying Animal isn't really a novel as we have come to expect it, there is no plot to speak of, barely any dialog, and it's 156 pages.  What it is is an exploration on the nature of life and death, it's about growing old in a country obsessed with the young.  The narrator of this monologue is David Kepesh, a 70ish professor reflecting on an affair he had with one of his much younger students several years earlier.  Something has happened, which we discover towards the end of the work, which has put him in a particularly pensive and reflective mood.  He talks on about his affair and other events in his life.  He's not a particularly likeable person, some would consider what he does despicable and sexist, yet what he has to say is compelling.  I don't think I could have taken 500 pages of the Dying Animal, but 156 seems about right.  What Kepesh has to say is thoughtful and thought-provoking, and the point of his monologue becomes clear as the work draws to a close.  The Dying Animal clearly isn't for the faint of heart, the easily offended.  If you can handle a thought-provoking exposition with apologies to no one, give this one a try.
0375805613|5.0|Grover is more than a little nervous - after all, there's a MONSTER at the end of the book. So, he enacts all kinds of zaniness like gluing the pages together in order to keep (protect) YOU (not him!!) from the monster at the end of the book.<br />This is the only book I remember my dad reading to me - EVER. (Probably because I asked for it a million times!!) He would act the parts out and change his voice and I would roll on the floor with laughter. When it came to Grover's antics, my dad would pretend that the pages really *were* stuck together. He'd grunt and groan and s-l-o-w-l-y turn the pages.<br />I read it to my kids - my children and students alike - in the same manner. And you know what? Everyone rolls on the floor giggling. Everyone has a good time.<br />I highly recommend this one - it is a great story about the wacky ways we devise to avoid what we think we fear. BUT, it is also a great way to build memories that will last forever with your children.
B00005A1PR|5.0|This cd isn't what i would normaly listen too, but i heard a few tracks on the radio and decided that i had to buy it.  From the moment you put this cd on, you are drawn inand you cannot let go.  My favourite tracks are Video, Promise, Brownskin, Always In My Head and Simple. This is a cd to have as its well produced and its one that you will get your monies worth from
B000005GW2|5.0|Chet is my main man...Ever since i saw the documentary about him (&quot;Let's Get Lost&quot;), I have never been able to get enough of this man's musical genius. And that goes for both his trumpet-paying and his singing.<br />Some people try to make the argument that he's really not a singer. Excuse me? Do you have ears? Aside from Billie Holiday, I don't think there is another jazz singer who can touch Baker. <br />I listen to a lot of singers...from Louie Armstrong to Abbie Lincoln to Nina Simone to Ella to Kurt Elling...and nobody moves me like Baker...<br />He's phenomenal...Buy this cd...do yourself a favor...
B000053VAF|5.0|Those people who really want more from their DVDs will probably already be aware of Kevin Smiths films, Smith really pushes the format, each of his previous releases (Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy &amp; Clerks Uncensored) are overladen with goodies.  Deleted Scenes, interviews and hilarious commentaries are standard issue for Smith and this disc brings Dogma into line, after a lacklustre bog standard release, this Special Edition really delivers.<br />With Smiths signature heroes Jay and Silent Bob again grabbing the plaudits, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck give fine performances, Chris Rock and Alan Rickman are great and with the gorgeous Linda Fiorentino and Salma Hayek producing the goods, is there really a reason not to buy this disc?<br />With the final instalment due soon (Jay &amp; Silent Bob Strike Back), take the opportunity to get Dogma and get up to date before it's over for good!

B000002JKA|5.0|I first got into Dream Theater because of these album , when I bought it I never thought that it would change all my music tastes at the time, Awake is a very interesting piece because it was a major change in Dream Theater musical style the album was wrote in inspiration of the images and words tour and reflects a whole experience with Dream Theater's signature, John Petrucci got a heavier sound by experimenting with seven string guitars and develop a darker sound than images and words, Awake was the last album recorded with the original keyboardist Kevin Moore, his solo contributions Space Dye Vest (a mid tempo basically piano-voice piece) is probably one of the most sentimental songs Ive ever heard in a my life, The virtousity roller coster starts with 6:00 an excelent song with incredible solos en tempo changes, next one of the signature songs of the album Caught in a web a killer piece with some cool strings effects, track tree is Innocence Faded, a melodic song with a great guitar solo, tracks four to six are mi personal favorite the trilogy a mind beside itself: &quot;Erotomania&quot; , a insane instrmental piece with odd time signatures cool piano parts, and a guitar solo that will blow you away, &quot;Voices&quot;: an epic song, probably one of Dream Theaters best pieces, and finally &quot;Silent Man&quot; an really cool acoustic guitar piece, track 7 The mirror ,is one of the heaviest dream theater songs a killer composition with great lyrics and unbelievable melody changes, track 8 Lie is a cool heavy song, with petrucci signature sound, Lifting shadows of a Dream: is a cool mid tempo song, with some great lyrics, Scarred is a like an album resume and all the members show their great skills, and the last Space Dye Vest Do your self a favor and buy these album now you wont regret ir never!
6304602944|5.0|A good action movie. There's some good nudity in this movie especially the topless women in the car. The women has nice boobies.
B00003CXN4|4.0|Had Traffic stuck to the storylines about Mexico and the Ayala arrest/trial, it would have been a modern classic.  Benicio Del Toro is nothing short of spectacular, and was well-deserving of his Oscar, and the interplay between the Feds monitoring Ayala's wife is very funny and believable.  Unfortunately, the filmmakers decided to go &quot;big picture&quot;, too, so we get the very weak Michael Douglas drug czar subplot.  Although it too has its moments (the scene where the boy o.d.s is very believable, particularly the profuse sweeting and feeling hot that proceeded it, and the tear in the eye of Douglas's daughter when she first freebases is a nice touch), the overall tone of this part of the film is a bit preachy.  The Douglas subplot also contains the two biggest flaws in the movie - the speed with which Douglas's daughter turns into a drug-crazed prostitute, and the totally unbelievable scene where Douglas resigns right in the middle of his first press conference (although I like the line, &quot;...I don't know how you wage war on your family.&quot;)  Still, this is a good, not great movie, and the DVD is pretty much along the same lines - some nice special features, but nothing that blows you away.  Recommended, but there are other DVDs you should own first.
014028009X|3.0|Having read &quot;Bridget Jones Diary&quot; first and then the &quot;Edge of Reason&quot;, I was glad that I had read the first, just to have the background to understand the second.  I found the first book to be so-so as far as entertainment value.  It is basically just an ordinary single womens view of life.
B000002JSP|3.0|In Through the Out Door reminds me of the Who's last few studio albums - competent enough, great sounding, but pretty short of new ideas.  Any Led Zeppelin album where the highlights are the ballads is really not quite up to snuff.  That said, Fool in the Rain is still a great song, but All of My Love gets a little old with repetition.  The rest of this album, though interesting to listen to, is ultimately expendable.
B00003CX5P|1.0|Lucas has forgotten what is to write and direct a movie and just remember what special effects are.<br />Sadly special effects are just shiny lights without meaning in this movie.<br />Also He manages amazingly well in destroying the concept of force,and death star explosion is now but a joke.<br />Sad, very sad, star wars first trilogy nows look a little worse than before
0790729725|5.0|&quot;GoodFellas&quot; is the best mob movie ever made, better than &quot;The Godfather&quot;. But the DVD is terrible. Ican't not give this movie 4 stars, but wait until they release the digitally remastered version (if they do)
B00003CX5P|1.0|This is, simply put, not a good movie. George Lucas used Kurosawa's &quot;hidden fortress&quot; as inspiration for the original Star Wars... why did he not search the volumes of film/foreign film classics for inspiration of this film? I would say that almost every movie I saw in the last year was better than this-- and I did not have very high expectations for this movie (I didn't see it until it was in the dollar theater.. after all of the bad reviews)<br />rather, this movie comes off as kind of like Star Trek... with the mysterious Force being explained pseudo-scientifically.... I guess a little kid might be amused by this film but I didn't like this movie at all.. and it would be shameful to even mention this dog excrement in the same sentence as modern movies.
6302914191|5.0|Well, I don't know where to start exactly, this is the most overwhelming Lynch mystery there is to offer. It's addicting, it's something you can fall in love with severely, it's basically the best work Lynch has ever really released. I love it. Buy it. It's the best watching you'll ever do. I gaurantee it. Even if you're not that cool with Lynch's work. It's a great experience. The Twin Peaks venture is brilliantly put together, however it is filmed on I think, EP mode, it's not the most perfect visual quality but as for the collection, it's always beautiful. I love it. I watch it as much as I can. 30 episodes of Twin Peaks, just ain't enough.
6305265488|5.0|This movie is really good. It is like Cinderella yet different. The story of this movie is really good and well throught up. One part that I find wierd is the part with Leodardo da Vinci and how he relates in the story it is a little wired, but don't get me wrong he is a great charactor and adds humor to the story.  Drew Barrymore acts wonderfully in the Middle Ages backgroud with all the elegent clothing. Angelica Huston is also a great charactor playing the evil step mother and having a world of her own. This movie is a sad someparts throughout the movie, but over all this is a great movie and I think you should see it today.
B00003CXDD|5.0|WILLOW MUST BE RELEASED ON DVD IT IS ONE OF THE PAST TIME FAVORITES U CANNOT NOT LIKE IT ITS IMPOSSIBLE  PLEASE MAKE THIS MOVIE ON DVD PS I'M 15
0375751513|5.0|Hell can be fun! A book choc-full of bon mots and little phrases to use in everyday life. Wilde was genius personified. Carry this with you always.
0553108034|5.0|I have to say that I was more impressed wih this novel than the first of the series.  The characters are equally believable and the plots have definitely thickened into a nice stew.  Tyrion is a wonderful character and the lines between men and women are more realistic for the time period than many other period pieces.<br />I will agree that Martin does have a thing for being descriptive with sex and that it really doesn't add a whole lot to the story.  I mean it's one thing to bring incest into the story, but another to graphically describe it.  I also still hold to my thought that he uses language that does not sound like it was part of that period.  i can't repeat the words here but they just dont fit in the story and when you come across them they stall the story a bit in my opinion.<br />I still think this book belongs a part of your Fantasy Masterpieces collection.
B00005B36H|5.0|....<br />The great thing about an album such as this is that each time you listen you \\"hear\\" new things.  Subtle intricacies and repetative beats become the main focus of the song and you are left, as I was, with it ringing in your head begging you to listen again.  You then find yourself hearing something new and even more complicated.  And then there are the lyrics....<br />But as with any great album, it requires many listens to gain appreciation for the music and to be on the same frequency as the artist(if that is even possible in this case!).  A comparison I can make is Dream Theater's \\"Scenes From A Memory\\" or even \\"Images and Words\\".  Two albums that have never strayed far from the CD player.  Very complex albums.  <br />Take the time, listen....
B00005B4GU|2.0|Pablo Honey was good. Bends was perfect. OK Computer mixed genius and self-indulgence. Kid A was almost pure self-indulgence--monotonous and pompous. Amnesiac is more of the same. Bring back the hooks!
B00004RFFS|5.0|I agree with someone who mentioned regarding the dvd.  Yes, it plays fine and yes it's &quot;dual layer&quot; where there will be a slight pause but the slight pause has the image as if the film was cut in half and put together.  The image in the next second is not continous with the image before the &quot;slight pause&quot;.  It should be &quot;flowing&quot;.  Brad Pitt tips his hat, next image his arm is down.  It's only on Chapter 15 though, but forewarned if you want a perfect movie on dvd because it's not!
6305265488|5.0|This movie is absolutely amazing, definitely my favorite of all time. It brings humanity and real emotion to the old Cinderella story. Every single character is well-developed and believeable (with perhaps the exception of one of the stepsisters, but sometimes you just need a villian). Danielle is wonderfully independant, passionate, and strong - all of those are the reasons Prince Henry falls in love with her. It is nice to see him be enchanted by her inner qualities and not simply her beauty. He grows up as a result of meeting her, as she fearlessly discusses her beliefs with him. Leonardo da Vinci is a great character, as the wise, irreverent old man who guides Henry through his emotions and decisions with sharp wit. Even the stepmother has her moments of weakness, and it is shown how her cruelty towards her stepdaughter is fueled by jealousy - the girl's father loved his daughter more than her. At any rate, this movie is a masterpiece and you will definitely feel satisfied at the end.
B00005K3LU|3.0|You really have to watch this movie with the precept that the bad guys forgot just one little detail...Bruce Friggin' Willis! You can just hear them saying under their breath every time he does something to throw them off their task or screw up their plans...'d'oh!' with a German accent of course.  And, thank God  that, though it was cut from the movie, the DVD special feature's outakes introduces us to the love scene Bruce has with his own ego after the cast rap party.  Really folks, it's entertaining, but good god, could the good guys and the bad guys be any less subltly defined?  I was waiting for Hans, the head bad guy to put on his Snidley Whiplash hat, twist his pointy moustache and yell; '...nyah ah ah!'  And what is it with the walkie-talkies?  Are we to believe clever international criminals are stupid enough to use such easily-monitored devices?  Apparently audiences are thought to be so dense the director thought they wouldn't 'get' all the action and plot line unless everyone was on the same page using a common communication device.  When it's all said and done, this movie is the modern day equivalent to a Roy Rogers western...complete with the 'yippee-i-o-ky-yay!' and the obligatory ride into the sunset.  Of course a sequel was inevitable...but the formula was the same...same plot, same protagonist, different venue.  I can just see the director now...'yeah that's it...instead of a big building, we'll do it in an airport!'  Oh it's a good movie, and it's okay to watch, but suspend disbelief and put your brain in the closet...you won't need it.  For this one, the second one and the third.
0790729628|1.0|Bring Back the Oringinal version that was shown in theaters with the voice over. It's a hell of a lot better than this \\"Director's Cut.\\" If the studio feels that this crappy director's cut is better, why not let the consumers compare by putting both versions on the DVD? But no, instead of doing something of quality that makes sense, the studios would rather release immediately whatever piece of manure that Adam Sandler decides to put on film.
B00004XOWN|1.0|This album is bad.  Limp is angry, but they have nothing to be angry over.  Fred cant rap, he cant sing, and he can't write anything intelligent.  The only reason anybody buys this is because it somehow got popular.  Shallow people like dumb jocks with low intelligence might enjoy this album.  If you want a real rap/metal band get some of the older rage albums.  And oh, zack de la rocha's rapping skills is superior to fred durst's.
B00003CX5P|4.0|It is very difficult to give the characters the depth they needed for this movie to be an oscar nominee, but Lucas did a fine job putting this film together.  I believe those that hated Jar Jar Binks with the passion they do are overly cynical, and overly pragmatic.  I didn't particularly enjoy his onscreen presence, but I don't subscibe to the &quot;Die Jar Jar Die!&quot; principle.<br />Wonderful effects, the characters needed a little more depth, and Annakin should have known what he was doing flying that Naboo fighter as opposed to, &quot;What does this button do?&quot;<br />Overall, an excellent movie, but it is missing some icing on the cake.
B00005B36H|5.0|First, let me say that I'm a casual Tool fan, casual meaning I have Undertow and APCs Mer de Noms (not Tool, I know, but Tool related), thus I cannot compare Lateralus to Aenima (although, if it's even half as good as Lateralus, I'll be buying it soon).  That being said, here's my review:<br />This is not an album for the faint of heart.  All of the songs are epic in scope if not epic in length.  I don't recommend it for the casual listener, for to truly appreciate the band's efforts, one must be an active listener (in other words, one can hear something new upon each new listen).  Here is a track-by-track review:<br />The Grudge: This and Ticks and Leeches are probably the worst songs on the CD.  This song sounds too disjointed for my personal tastes, although there is a pretty cool part towards the middle.<br />Eon Blue Apocalypse: One of the &quot;artsy&quot; songs on the album.  No singing, just a minute or so of hauntingly beautiful music.  A perfect way to lead into The Patient.<br />The Patient: Much better than The Grudge, in my opinion.  The last segment of the song is incredible.  As infinite and intimate as the mind.<br />Mantra: Artsy song #2.  Another haunting song, and this, too, serves as a perfect lead into the next song, Schism.<br />Schism: I think we all know how good this is :)<br />Parabol &amp; Parabola: These are essentially one song.  Very uplifting, and the way they connect is great.  Probably my favorite(s) on the album.<br />Ticks &amp; Leeches: Eh.  Maynard sounds pretty...upset.  Not my particular cup of tea, and it doesn't seem to fit into the rest of the album.<br />Lateralus: The title track is a very good song.  I especially like the last half.<br />Reflection: This reminds me of Pink Floyd.  Eerie, beautiful, incredible.  <br />Disposition: Over ten minutes of genius.<br />Triad: If Hell had a theme song, this would be it.<br />The last &quot;song&quot;: I forgot the name of it, but it isn't a song, rather an audio clip about Area 51.<br />The disappointments on the album are blown away by the other incredible tracks, and thus the five star rating.  Don't buy it because it is Tool.  Buy it because it is an epic.
B00003CWTH|2.0|Magnolia is way too weird for me.  I watched the whole thing hoping that it would get better and also hoping that it would somehow make sense in the end.  I guess it was not supposed to make sense ... it was just supposed to show you how people's lives interconnect.  There are a some good things about this movie though!  Such as the music, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Melora Walters' BIG and beautiful smile at the end. My heart went out to Stanley the Whiz Kid and I cried for him.  Great acting by Blackman, Hoffman and Walters. Also, Cruise plays a great egomaniac!
B00003CXHJ|2.0|U571 is a badly written film. It is a bias film that would have had potential but it didnt. I didnt like it because it was boring and there was no suspense. An example of this is when there all dancing, about to go on the submarines. It lacked a the true storyline, and this is the main reason of the movies weakness. The that were bertrayed were very realistic, such as the germans and how they looked not as heroic as the americans. they looked like dogs, with smely underarms and they hadnt shaved for a few days. This was the main positive thought of the film. Overall it wasnt a great success, it was a fizzer meaning everyone thought it would be good and it turned out to be bad. i would give it a two out of five. I dont recommend seeing it. You are just wasting your money when you could be spending it on other movies such as Saving Private Ryan and the Shawshank Redemption.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Radiohead started with Pablo Honey, straight rock and roll.  They followed with The Bends,a classic which took there music to a new level.  Their last two, Kid A and Amnesiac have become more into electronica and experimentation and less about guitars.  OK Computer is the point of Radiohead's career where the new and the old met, and it doesnt get any better.  You want highlights?  How about songs 1-12?  From the rocker Airbag to the epic Paranoid Android, from the energetic Electioneering to the eery Climbing Up the Walls, this album gets better with every listen.
0553573403|5.0|George R.R. Martin has written the very best fantasy series that I have ever read, and I have read them all!  This story is so far above anything else that is out there - including the much applauded Robert Jordan and Terry Goodkind series - I cannot recommend it more highly.  Superb writing on every level; character development, plot, readability, etc.  A must read for every fantasy fan.
B00003CXSM|5.0|I WAS VERY HAPPY THAT I FOUND OUT JENNIFER WAS DOING A COMEDY, NOW IM MORE HAPPY THAT ITS COMING OUT ON DVD SOON.<br />THE MOVIE IS ABOUT A WELL KNOWN WEDDING PLANNER WHO FALLS IN LOVE WITH A GUY WHO IS ALREADY ENGAGED, IT ACROSS THE LINES OF MY BEST FRIENDS WEDDING, THERE ARE ALOT OF TOUCHING MOMENTS IN THE FILM, AND SOME VERY COMEDIC SCENES. J-LO DID A VERY GOOD JOB CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT THIS IS HER FIRST COMEDY FILM.<br />A MUST FOR ANY J-LO FAN!
B00005BJ2O|5.0|With this soundtrack you can relive every moment of a brilliant movie.  Every track brings back exciting visual memories and more because some tracks such as &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; which were not played in their entirety in the movie, are brilliantly played in full-length versions.  This is a must for every fan of the movie.
B00005LMBK|5.0|After seeing Clint Eastwood on TV, and listening to a few downloaded imports, I was really anxious for this album to come out.  The Gorillaz sound like Beck with Blur's lead singer at the vocals instead.  This album has just as many unique sounds in it as Odelay.  Anywhere from Harmonicas to Nintendo sounds.  If you're looking for an album to chill with, pick this up!
B00003CXHJ|2.0|The film U-571 is as entertaining and captivating as any other product of hollywood. But when look at from a historical point of view, its inaccuracies and misrepresentations are sky high. Not two minutes of the film can pass without sign of hollywoods ignorance of the events that took place in the race to capture the enigma code machine. Even someone with little historical knowledge can identify innacurracies through nothing more than common sense. It is shocking that the writer and director of the film can portray the events with such imprecise detail and show such disrespect to the men who lost their lives in these events of WWI.  This film would be good if more historical research was attempted. I rate it 4 out of ten.
B00003CXHJ|3.0|U-571 is a new film that has been released in the USA and around the world been fairly successful.<br />In the film there are two main countries that are fighting each other (the Germans and the Americans). The Americans of course are made out to be the courageous men wearing the white suits and the finely shaved beards looking very smart to the viewer. This then made them look like the good guys in the film. The Germans are made out to be the bad guys in the film with their dress been rather scrubbed up and their beards been not shaven at all. <br />The film rather in accurate in the way it betrayed both of countries in the way that they did. An inaccuracy was that the Americans weren't even in the war yet. The Americans didn't move in to the war until a later stage.<br />Overall I thought that the film was rather inaccurate and wasn't good to be bartered on the film that was released in the cinema. I gave the film 3/5.
B000007SIN|5.0|Excellent music, excellently mastered.  This is a 5.1 channel DTS CD.  It is playable on any A/V system that can decode DTS and has a digital line back to a CD or DVD player (even ones that can't play DTS movies).<br />The surround mix has been critisized for having the horns in the rear channels.  However, the mix is consistent in the location of the instruments (no flying trumpets), so I really like the use of the surround channels.  The bass is punchy and well defined.<br />Overall this disc is highly recommanded and I still use it to show up what an A/V system can do (even with DVD-Audio discs available).
B00003CXHJ|5.0|What really happened in the spring of 1942? Did the Yanks really go in and take over the enigma machine? Did the Americans play any part in the battle for the atlantic?<br />This movie, aside the fact that nothing in the events was close to the real happenings, was a thriller. It combined the old World War 2 style of events with the gung-ho and always courageous effort of the all-muscly Americans. <br />It is set around the capture of the Enigma coding machine, by the Brits, in Spring- 1942, and was to be of major victory to the allied forces in the coming days. The Americans (the ONLY contributers to the war.....) decided they would twist the events and make it look like they had done everything and won us the war.  All in all it was a great success, and the movie was awesome in the fact that it showed the reality of what life at war was really like 50 years ago. But it still lacked a few major facts. - The real U571 was destroyed 2months before this even happened. - The Americans weren't even in the war at the time. - The British were the courageous young lads who led the daring  assault.<br />So just remember the facts when you watch the movie, and as amazingly cool as it seems, dont be swayed by the &quot;facts&quot; that this movie portrays. It is an excellent choice, and i urgwe you to watch it as soon as possible. Top class work.
B000056HUA|4.0|This is so close to a perfect DVD-Audio disc from Warner Music that it is disappointing it isn't.  The tracks have been meticulous remastered and the sound is sharp and &quot;new&quot;.  &quot;Riders on the Storm&quot; has the storm in all the channels and is extremely effective.  I played it in a local home theater store that had overhead rear speakers and that was very interesting.<br />The one track that still needs work is &quot;Love Her Madly&quot;.  The drum solos fly around all the channels per beat.  An interesting effect but somewhat annoying after a while.  But, the real disappointing part is the LFE (the .1 low bass channel).  The LFE level on &quot;Love Her Madly&quot; is almost non-existent on the DVD-Audio version but powerful on the Dobly Digital version.  Unfortunately, this means the Dolby Digital version sounds better than the DVD-Audio version of &quot;Love Her Madly&quot;.  I find it hard to believe that this was intended.<br />So, with the exception of the one track, the disc is excellent.  Too bad Warner Music can't fix that problem and make this a fully enjoyable disc.
B0000042HV|5.0|I can't add much to the other favorable reviews. It's just a great set: great music (truly! to me it's like a blend of Haydn and Bartok), great playing, great sound. Great price! Grab it, folks! See why we revere Shostakovich as one of the greats.
B00003CXDZ|2.0|When I bought the ticket for this movie, I thought it was a remake of the old movie based on the life of Toulouse-Lautrec.  I expected to see some semblance of reality.  This movie was trash-a mere vehicle for a lot of trashy rock music.  The only thing good about it was the beautiful Nicole Kidman.  The farcical treatment was absurd. It was hard to take it seriously because of all the silly musical bits. This was nothing like what Paris looks like. A ridicuous elephant draped in front of the Moulin Rouge?  Seriously, save yourself money or buy a movie that's  worth the viewing.
0449227545|4.0|I read very little fiction but this book caught my interest.  I grew up in California - &quot;earthquake country&quot; and that is why I chose this book to read. This book is fairly fast paced and gives good descriptions of the places, and especially the characters. A good book for those looking for &quot;brain candy&quot; to kick back with and something thought provoking.  What if this were possible?  A very fresh idea and viewpoint on domestic terrorists.  A great summertime read. Enjoy!
0679879269|3.0|What a shame, as the first two were so good.  And I'm not talking about the theology, about which I couldn't give a rat's rear. It's all fiction to me anyway, and having encountered, wide-eyed, Ellison's 'The Deathbird' when I was 13, I can't well deny the value of some good, rousing blasphemy for intelligent young readers.  The problem for me is structural.  Halfway through this one, I got the distinct impression that Pullman panicked and was literally making it up as went along, rather than following some preconceived, well-thought-out plot.  I'm sure that can't be true, but how else to explain the awkward changes of heart Mrs. Coulter and Lord Asriel go through, the embarrassingly-named 'Metatron' character, the hurried tieing up of loose ends that comprises the last hundred or so pages?  Still, the early  'interludes' featuring the dreaming Lyra are wonderful, and the scene where Will and Lyra finally face up to their fates is truly wrenching, epitomizing the themes of loss and separation that made the first two books so moving.
B00005B36H|5.0|great stuff,I have been wighting for this cd for 5 yrs and it has been worth it,with all the so called music out there its good to know there are real bands who know how to rock, buy this cd all u limp bizkit sell outs stay out.
0060392886|4.0|A fascinating read...the band and various other players take us on a whirlwind tour of their lives and career as one of the most notorious bands in history. Written in diary style, each chapter features a different voice. No one is spared, least of all themselves. I couldn't put this book down. Dysfunctional families, illness, violence, sex, drugs, rock 'n roll, death... it's all here. Guaranteed to keep you reading well into the night, even if you're not a Motley Crue fan.
B00005BL2A|5.0|great cd depeche mode never disappoints with there heart felt electro/synth music, shine is a strong balled full of emotion but i love all there music and always will
6305078181|2.0|The first time I watched this movie was back in 1980. I remember it as the first Vampire movie which depicted a Dracula holding a cross. I was quite impressed back then.<br />More than 20 years later, I bought the DVD version of the movie from local HMV store. After viewing it, I believe I paid too much. I was expecting the quality that DVD can deliver, but most of the time I was under the impression that I was watching a VHS copy, instead of DVD. The colour was poor and close to black and white. Although I have set my screen contrast to high, the picture was still too dark. The sound, on the other hand, was quite reasonably done (for the movie of its age). One more thing worth mentioning is the closed captioning service. I spot quite a few errors which I believed was caused by some confusion. This movie used the original Bram Stoker's character, but did not really follow the original story. But again, this is not Bram Stoker's Dracula, so I guess it's OK to modify a bit of the story line.<br />My conclusion: I was not impressed by this DVD. In fact, watching it once is more than enough for me. Imagine Entertainment should have treated the movie better.
0393317552|5.0|That was the question, posed by a tribal leader in New Guinea, which piqued the curiosity of one Jared Diamond and fomented the production of this fascinating and accessible account of the development of human civilization.<br />Mr. Diamond begins with the first humans, and describes the movement and evolution of these humans. He demonstrates the primacy of environment to the progress of people groups and crafts a convincing case for the what might be called the &quot;right place at the right time&quot; school of cultural supremacy. <br />Advantages such as a wide variety of domesticable plants and animals and the ease of transmission of technologies explain the rapid rise of some to meteor heights without reference to any innate superiority. <br />The advantages bestowed by their respective geography culminated in the development of Guns, Germs and Steel by the would-be-colonizers. <br />In short, this book weaves the bare facts of World geography into a wholesale account of the development of human societies. Mr. Diamond is fully cognizant of the political ramifications of accounting for the different development rates of people groups, thus he is careful to eschew any idea that would smack of racial superiority and reaffirm the completely contingent and external sources of such differences.<br />Diamond, in fact, essentially assumes that racial or ethnic differences are irrelevant. He makes numerous attempts to discredit theories based upon racial difference and restricts his positive explanatory assertions to those based upon geography. <br />The Book is a fascinating speculative account of the development of human society. It seemed to me that he was a bit too curt in dispensing other, less politically palatable, explanations for this phenomena. In so doing, he abstains from bringing the death knell down on the claim of an innate basis for racial disparities.  His ultimate conclusions were hamstrung by his self-imposed political constraints that serve to hamperthe compelling case that he makes in opposition. Nonetheless, the book is so ambitious and fascinating, that I was more than willing to overlook this shortcoming.
6305546789|3.0|A good way to start this franchise. chilling story about killer believed to be pure evil escaping from mental hospital after killing his older sister as a kid. The plot focuses on him trailing after his sister played by Jamie Lee Curtis. Donald Pleasance does a wonderful job as Michael's doctor. One of the more successful horror franchises, but sorry, it and michael do not compare to Friday the 13th and Jason Voorhees. Although it is one of the 3 best series.(the other being Freddy and A Nightmare on Elm Street series)
B0000508U6|5.0|coldplay reminds you a little bit of the beatles but with a harder rock edge to really get you going. seriously guys i listened to this cd for 9 hours straight flying amsterdam to atlanta, both ways, and i didn't get bored with it. is there any greater test of a cd's intrest value. check it out and see what a new group of guys has done with the beatles sound, think oasis but not so nasty.
6305971099|1.0|This movie is bad. Nothing else can be said about it
B00005ASOI|5.0|...  This is an excellent movie, full of atmosphere, mystery, and suspense. It is not, admittedly, for those who don't like a slower pace, and is not a cheap-shock-a-minute gore fest like alot of horror films, but thoughtful and artistic. The color saturation is beautiful, and the screen is drenched in greens and reds, making the viewer feel quite uncomfortable (it grabs you so much that, later in the film, when the main character actually leaves the primary setting, the outside world doesn't quite seem right). The music is insane; one of the best ever. Goblin has never been better. And there is blood and gore and frights. This is my favorite movie ever, so don't listen to a few negative reviews by people who don't get it ... - check it out for yourself. It won't be a waste of time.
6305137293|2.0|This takes place immediately after H1 with Michael stalking his sister in the hospital. Again, Donald Pleasence is great in this movie, but the series starts its downfall after this movie
6305531374|2.0|this film tries to recapture the spirit of the 1st two but by doing this basically disregards h3-6. So much for continuality. This should have been the end but they just had to make pt8 which makes H20's ending look stupid. H8 has no chance of being good
B00003CXRP|3.0|Don't get me wrong, I had a great time watching it.  Tom Hanks is fun to watch, the story moves along at a nice pace, and Zemeckis does a good job of getting you to care about Hanks and Hunt.<br />But come on, how many times did we have to see the FedEx logo???  I understand that Hanks' character works there, but they show the FedEx logo in virtually every shot for the first half hour of the movie.  Sometimes they show you 4 or 5 logos in the same shot, it's like paying to watch a commercial.  I wouldn't be surprised if they asked Hanks to wear a FedEx cap for the island scenes.
B00003CX5P|1.0|I will not buy this on DVD. I will not buy the &quot;first&quot; three either (unless they release a NON-special edition version). I'm not going to make Lucas or Fox any richer on my dollar.<br />I'm not going to talk about what this movie could have been. Everybody has their theories about what they wanted to see on that screen after waiting 20 years. I want to approach this movie on it's own, and not as part of a universe. The main reason that Alien 3 was so disappointing was because of the story line inconsistency with the previous movies. It was terrible what that film did to the story that Scott and Cameron had built up, but taken on it's own it's not really that bad of a film. I wanted to give the Menace the same chance.<br />To address some arguments before I begin. First, as far as I know, in 1977, Star Wars was not made for children. Star Wars did not cater to children. It had audiences from 5 to 75 fascinated. Not just 3-13 year old future Gen-Xers, but all audiences fell in love with that movie. In LA, people in their twenties and thirties went to see Star Wars two to three times a day. This film was ground breaking and blew people's minds. Sure, when you see \\"Star Wars\\" or \\"2001:A Space Odyssey\\" now, it is possible to forget the impact these movies had. Taken in context of when they were released, these movies inspired, confused, and awed audiences of ALL AGES world wide.<br />Second, I state that children do not need to be catered to. When I was eight years old I saw one of the greatest films ever made, Raiders of the Lost Arc. At that time in my then short life, Raiders was the most incredible thing that I had ever seen. As an eight-year-old, believe it or not, I did not need a flatulant pack animal or a goofy sidekick or a \\"yippee\\" child to keep my attention. I enjoyed a movie that was able to be very fun and intelligent on it's own merits.<br />Now on to the menace. The first thing seen in this movie are bug-like aliens who have overdubbed Asian accents that don't match their lip movements. In the beginning of this epic space opera, the director starts us off with the equivalent to what we see at 2:00 in the morning watching 70's Kung Fu movies. Bad overdubbing.<br />Next we get our buddy. The Jar-ster. I don't think I need to comment. Within the first two minutes on screen the Biggs quotes Wayne's World. How \\"current\\" to make reference to a movie that came out in 1991. I'm sure at least half of the 1300+ reviews below me have gone into how hideous this character is, so I don't need to. The Phantom Edit speaks for millions....\\"exsqueeze me\\"?????!?!?!?!?<br />The \\"bad guys\\" in this film, rather than the menacing Stormtroopers, are a group of rickety robots. They don't have any emotional quality to them, so the only way to make them threatening is to show them in immense numbers. Who are the robots the biggest threat to? The CG gungens. Oh...no real loss there. The gungens are rather annoying anyway, and watching the CG robots attack the CG gungens doesn't really impact the film viewer in any way.<br />The pod race was 80% there. The sports announcers really took from that scene. It brought the movie out of \\"long ago and far away\\" to USA Saturday Football game. It totally killed the suspension of disbelief that a viewer tries to build up. Also, the race was so ... boring that Jabba even fell asleep. Yippee!<br />What I put above are what would give this film two or three stars. Add into the mix that Darth Vader built C-3PO, the really stupid space battle where Anakin accidentally blows up the robot control ship...whoops, the E.T.'s that were in the Galactic Council. The stupid accents given to every alien race, rather than developing a creative language like Jawwa, Huttes, and Ewok. Changing the Zen philosophies of \\"Empire\\" into mitochondria...*cough* I mean midichlorians. <br />What gives this film the 0-1 star rating is the lack of character. I don't give ... about special effects. Clerks, Rear Window, The Godfather, Reservoir Dogs, and Goodfellas had hardly any special effects, but are superior films because the characters are fascinating. Special Effects can only help a movie, and will never make a movie great unless there is meat underneath them. As the now gone Eon Magazine said, Obi-Wan was basically a glorified mechanic in this film. His job was to...fix the ship. At last Darth Maul will have his revenge. For what? Qui-gon is on the outs with the Jedi council...why?<br />My Phantom edit: Give Qui-gon and Darth Maul more flushing out and back story. Cut out the gungens completely. Edit the space battle so it's exciting. Cut the slave stuff out. We've spent 3 movies on Tatooine now, time to move on. Spend an additional 20 minutes on Corsecant (sp?). Spend 20 fewer minutes on Tatooine. Spend a lot less time on gungen planet. Try to edit the other action sequences to be as exciting as the light saber duels. There's too much to fix, so I maintain my 0-1 star rating. I hope the second film will be better, but I'm not holding my breath. A friend of mine at ILM tells me that they will return to that desert planet a fourth time, and have just as much frigging Jar Jerk as before. At least we have \\"The Fellowship Ring\\" to look forward to. Peter Jackson has yet to disappoint!
B000003S5H|5.0|All I need is the air that I breathe and the Air that plays on my stereo.  Hands down the best album ever made.  I was never a fan of electronic music until the day I heard Air and my life was changed forever.  Air is now my drug of choice and it gets me higher than any chemical has every been able to.  Buy it, live it, love it.  Good music has finally been awakened from it's long dormancy and it has proven to be a sleeping giant.  Music fans rejoice the musical messiahs are here and things just keep getting better and better with the recent release of 10,000 Hz Legend.  The music gods are smiling upon us all.
0440234743|4.0|This was one of the few books I have read in recent years that  made an indelible mark on my soul.  I was prepared for the usual quick, absorbing but light, read of a typical Grisham novel, but this one is different.  It delves into depths of the human heart and psyche in such a personal and universal fashion that everyone who has lived a rich life can relate to it.  It is a story of healing and deliverance and ultimate peace, and who isn't looking for that?  However, this is no feel-good, pat answer, pop novel.  The &quot;gold&quot; is felt from realizing the struggle required from every human on the road to personal discovery and true fulfillment. It also has inspired a new passion for me; traveling.  After reading this book, I am suddenly aware of my own desire to seek out the unknown, whether in some far-away exotic locale or just in my own daily life.  Sounds extreme?  This, in my opinion, is an extreme novel.  Extreme in its daring, but authentic quest for ultimate truth and subsequent peace that cannot be found any other way but the long way.
B00003CXRP|4.0|this is really two movies in one.  unfortunately, neither of which really comes to fruition.  <br />the first movie is about a guy with his priorities seemingly askew (work obsessed) getting a rude awakening to what really matters.  except that this latter awakening never really happens à la *fearless*.  instead after a gripping crash scene and the learning of a lot of survival skills, the metaphysical or spiritual awakening never occurs.  which is too bad.  it's a definite and noticeable void in the film.  (the first film :)<br />the second film, well, that might be a spoiler if i saw too much, but needless to say it wasn't too well done either.  it could have been much more fully explored, but seems to have been cut very short and it seems like the writers (which i guess includes Hanks) were sort of searching for an ending.  and that's the way the movie plays out.  <br />there needed to be more character development and better insights into human nature in order to really make this movie into something special.  and unfortunately it didn't happen.<br />that said, Hank's acting throughout is marvelous, and it is still a compelling film - as in: what would i do in such a situation? . . . it makes you think :)
0375707972|1.0|I was very excited to start The Reader because I had heard such wonderful things about it.  Unfortunately, I was very disappointed.  I found the relationship between Hanna, a grown woman, and a teenage boy really sick.  Then when I saw how their relationship paralleled the relationship that Hanna had with the children in the concentration camps, I was even more disturbed.  In addition, I did not find the book thought provoking, or educational as many other readers have.  As I was reading I also felt that some of the lack of fluidity must be from the translation from German, which was more interesting to me than the story itself.  As a side note, I read this book for a book club, and no one else enjoyed the book either.
B00003CWTI|1.0|holy cow, did this movie stink!  poorly adjusted people swearing, complaining, doing drugs, spacing out, whining about their feelings and misery for more than three whole hours.  oh joy!  then there were the overly-long dreary songs and the cast sing-along in the middle of the film to boot.  and of course don't forget about the &quot;surprise&quot; ending.<br />this film tops my &quot;stupidest films of the 90's&quot; list, with *the green mile* a close second.<br />someone please get pta some prozac before he writes his next film.  because this film was complete trash.
B000000WZ4|5.0|Ultra is different that DM's prior CD's. More moody, not as poppy and a bit edgier and sexier. Dave's vocals are smooth, but Martin's &quot;Home&quot; is so sincere and so raw, you almost feel you walked in on a private conversation.
B00003CXE7|4.0|let's be honest.  this is basically a faster paced but not as well done version of *braveheart*.  the musical score is very good, and it's made all the more better by lisa gerard's contributions.  the actions scenes are good.  Russell Crowe's acting is very good.  Connie Nielsen's unfortunately isn't until the final scene.  Joaquin Phoenix does ok as the unloved and immature son, but isn't buyable as a ceasar.  the editing and directing and lighting frankly were subpar - it's like this movie wanted so badly to be a Simpson/Bruckheiemer production, but couldn't master the tricks of that genre.  the editing was choppy and intrusive.  the fight scenes were good, but the directing in final night scenes was difficult to follow.  perhaps this was in part due to the measures they had to take to cover for Oliver Reed's untimely death.  it's too bad this movie didn't have a more leisurely pace and a little better acting, character development and plot development.  but this movie was geared toward being a summer blockbuster, not a classic.
6303369170|5.0|Has been one of my all-time favorite movies since first seeing a showing of the original version (terrible that that isn't available).  I still watch the this version about once a year and still notice some new metaphor or motif every time.  Some very dark humor here -- Lili Taylor attempting to hang herself with a pair of panty hose is hilarious.  Taylor and Depp are wonderful throughout.  Seems to me like this was an unusual role for Depp -- he plays a rather average sort of fellow, who finds himself among some real eccentrics.  While others may feel that those eccentricities are a bit over the top, in some ways this made them all the more believable to me.  Too bad the soundtrack isn't available -- it includes an Iggy Pop song that I'd really like to have.
B00003CXP1|5.0|This movie is unbelievable -- who would have thought I would care about these people.  You do.  You know someone like them or are one yourself.<br />The day after I saw this movie , I couldn't get the music or the images out of my head. They are not good images.<br />It is better to see this movie having no idea what to expect (as I did) because if you have heard hype or whatever you are kind of expecting it.  I was not expecting it and don't know if I could sit through it again.<br />I loved the cineamatography (spell?) and thought the acting was incredible.  BUT IT IS THE SADDEST MOVIE YOU WILL EVER SEE, DEPRESSING AND SAD.  But I have to admit -- it did move me.

B000002P2W|3.0|Probably the best part of this release by these modsters were the softer and more eccentric cuts on the record.  The Pete Townsend sung Blue, Red, and Grey is a real pretty track.  Probably one of Pete's best complete solo vocals.  Imagine A Man features Roger at his best on vocals as well as some nice piano accompanyment.  Squeeze Box is a goofy fun song and However Much I Booze is charming even if Townsends vocals strain in spots.<br />In general, this is a good recording.  No tracks are particularly weak.  Other than the cool bass and drum riffs from Dreaming From The Waist, the heavy rocking tracks just don't add  many mind blowing instrumental passages as on previous releases such as Who's Next, Tommy, Quadrophenia, and others.  Three and a half stars on a good day.
B00000I41G|5.0|Wonderful indeed... and worthy of inclusion on anyone's shortlist of the best late night albums ever made. Kenny Burrell's &amp; Stanley Turrentine's superbly cool playing combined with strong blues based melodies and lock-tight backings produce music that completely captures the ambience of a smoky club on a hot summer night. Unobtrusive, unforgettable and packed full of low-key jazz virtuosity at its very best.
0345347951|5.0|The key to appreciating Childhood's End is to recognize that it is not actually about humanity. Or more accurately, it is not merely or even primarily about humanity. This story evokes its strong reactions because, at its core, it is really about the universe. It transcends the cares and concerns of humanity and asks us to consider the cosmic perspective. Therein lies its power. Step by step, we come to understand that the story of humanity is actually only one thread within a huge and truly awesome canvass.<br />Childhood's End may be one of Clarke's earliest novels, but it is by no means immature. In many ways, it is his most ambitious project. While many of his future novels will force us to view humanity in a context that greatly exceeds our conventional perspectives, he will never again force upon us a perspective as vast as this. Those who interpret it as pessimistic are wrong. Clarke's vision is too large to be confined to purely human terms like optimism or pessimism. In its final pages, we are caught up in something so momentous that to apply human concerns to it seems pedestrian and provincial.<br />Clarke's writing will never qualify as great literature. His characters tend towards the static and the flat. In all of his writings, there isn't a single protagonist who is burdened with the angst or the inner conflict that defines the most memorable characters in the classics. He cannot reach the depth that, say, a Joyce or a Dostoyevsky can. In 2001 A Space Odyssey, far and away the most interesting character is a sentient computer. Similarly, Clarke's themes, while entirely worthy, offer no fundamentally novel insights into human nature. His plots are interesting, but don't keep us up nights turning the pages.<br />Clarke's genius lies not in the strength of his writing but in the depth of his imagination. In general, Science Fiction is distinguished from other genres primarily in the depth and breadth of its imagination and Clarke is one of its Grand Masters. He is at his best describing other worlds so exotic and astounding that one can't decide whether the greater marvel is his imaginings or the fact of his imagining them. This is very evident in his description of the dreams of the super-child, dreams that are, quite literally, otherworldly. And the ending itself comprises one of the most imaginative exercises in the genre.<br />All good writing challenges one to think outside oneself. But for me, Childhood's End is a masterpiece because it challenges one to think outside all of humanity. We are reminded that the universe is comprised of more than just bipedal water-based oxygen-catalysing meat. Clarke goes beyond the grandeur of the human spirit to encompass the grandeur of the universe.
B000002OX5|3.0|On this CD you can see The Who at its most impish; having fun making mock radio commercials (which is intriguing when you hear \\"Bargain\\" used in car commercials) and songs that have a more lighthearted feel to them than the songs you hear in their later recordings. The bittersweet humor of \\"Tattoo\\" is worth the price alone, but this CD also contains the brilliant \\"I Can See For Miles\\" and an early form of the &quot;concept&quot; songs(Rael) later used on Tommy and Quadrophenia. The sound is a bit primitive if you're used to the later more polished band but any fan of the band should give this a listen.
0553278398|3.0|Like the old friend who doesn't know when to quit the party, this sequel has overstayed its welcome. Producing one-sequel-too-many seems to be an occupational hazard that strikes many writers of popular fiction, but it especially afflicts authors of science fiction. Herbert should have stopped after his first Dune novel. Clarke should never have added any further digits to 2001. And Asimov, who created what is arguably the best trilogy in the genre, should never have produced the dish-watery addendums that have made up each of the sequels to the three masterful originals.<br />The original Foundation trilogy worked in part because it struck the right balance between exposition and mystique. As the founder of psychohistory (one of the most inventive creative achievements in the SF genre), Hari Seldon may have been no more than a man, but Asimov wisely invested him with an almost mythical allure. This mystique was derived by maintaining a certain distance between the reader and the character, a remoteness that was necessary to sustaining the enormity of the books' setting. In making Seldon a larger than life figure, Asimov produced an archetype: a personification of knowledge; a symbol of intellectual potency; a prophet for the totality of human history. It is unwise to flesh such a figure out too fully. By limiting our knowledge, Asimov frees our imaginations to impart an element of majesty to the archetype that a more detailed exposition would only have destroyed.<br />In this book, and in each of the subsequent sequels, Asimov makes the mistake of demystifying Seldon. In so doing, he demystifies the universe that he so painstakingly created. We can no longer lose ourselves in the vast historical sweep of a galactic empire. Instead, our attention is diverted from the large drama of its collapse to the small drama of one man's struggle. In losing the mystique, we also lose the wonder.<br />To be sure, in the hands of a literary genius, stories setting off the life ofa single individual against a backdrop of immense historical forces can be very compelling. But Asimov is no Hugo or Tolstoy. As a writer, his strengths are not to be found in his characterizations, his finesse, or in his facility with high drama. Like all great science fiction writers, Asimov's primary strength is his imagination. A galactic empire; a planet-straddling galactic capital; human behaviour reducible to mathematical laws; mental manipulation of emotions; the delicate balance of the human mind; the empathic relationship between the individual and the group; these are the themes that show him in the best light. When he sticks to them, as he does in the original trilogy, he invents a future that is overwhelming in its texture and its scope. When he departs from them, as he does here, the shallowness of his characters doom us to a disappointing stroll through the merely mediocre.
B000002OZY|4.0|With Tommy, The Who have created a musical experience for anyone who loves popular music best when it challenges the listener. Townshend's  \\"deaf, dumb, and blind boy\\" is a masterful creation and The Who does some of their finest work on this CD. While the plot is a mystery (What happened in 1921?)  the journey through Tommy's life reflects on the world, even with such repulsive characters as Uncle Ernie and Cousin Kevin. The imagery is there for the listener to interpret; you get to decide what it all means. (Isn't that more fun than having it all spelled out for you?)
B00003CXDZ|5.0|One of the most different, unnerving and yet fabulous shows of all time.  A spectacular display of costuming, choreography and opulent scenery is flashed at the moviegoer in a strobelight effect never seen by this reviewer outside of MTV.  The scenes are chopped up and thrown at you, bit by bit, which makes for a totally unique experience.  A visual feast.  A rollercoaster of a ride.  The musical numbers are so out of sync with the era and the emotional context of the scenes that it makes it delightfully reminiscent of Gilbert and Sullivan.
B00003CX5P|3.0|I feel ripped off, but I should have seen it coming.<br />Wasn't it about a year ago, that the world (well, at least Star Wars fans around the world) was either looking forward to being able to watch Episode 1 at home, and the rest was pissed off that it was only on VHS, that they were allowed to watch the Star Wars prequel that split over 20 years worth of faithful desciples.<br />Back then I wasn't sure if I should buy the VHS version, I wanted to wait for the DVD, but when I read that Lucas was planning to wait for Ep. 3 to be finished and then release all six films together on DVD for the first time, I reluctantly bought an inferior VHS copy. How stupid was I?<br />Now about a year after the VHS release, LucasFilm announces the DVD release for the most anticipated movie in cinema history for this fall. One could believe he needs more money for completing Ep. 2 (as if George Lucas hasn't milked us enough in the past 20 years).<br />Despite my gripes, I have preordered Ep. 1 on DVD (but I bet you guessed that already, dincha?). Let's just hope Lucas won't pull the same stunt with Ep. 2. <br />PS: 5 stars for the movie + 1 for the later DVD release = 6 / 2 = 3 stars.
0618135871|5.0|This is not a sex book. It is an essay on &quot;letting go&quot; and on facing death. Sex is a metaphor for life; as it has always been for Roth. Perhaps, if I were younger, I may have missed the point. David's battle with depression is the war we all fight as seniors. And Roth's never ending struggle with the concept of committment has been an recurring theme throughout his career. It is true that he comes back to these themes many times, but he does so with great skill and creative talent. A few of his books have, in my opinion, been over the top, but this one is a strong &quot;thumbs up&quot;
B00005ATQI|5.0|I love this movie. It's brilliant, hilarious, disturbing, and intriguing. Yes, Kubrik strayed a great deal from King's novel but you know what-- he improved it in my opinion.
B00000CQJZ|4.0|The quality of the Laserlight/Hollywood Classics DVD releases appears inconsistent at best.  Their version of THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH is quite good, while their edition of Orson Welles' MR. ARKADIN was shockingly poor.  Fortunately, Laserlight's issue of THE 39 STEPS falls into the former category.  While I'm sure the Criterion Collection version is probably superior in terms of picture and sound quality, it's also much more expensive (at least four times the price).  If you are just looking for a useable copy to watch without worrying about extras, this version should be just what you're looking for.<br />THE 39 STEPS is one of Alfred Hitchcock's most famous films and upon viewing it's easy to see why.  The plot revolves around an old Hitchcock standby - an innocent man who becomes caught up in an international secret society of spies.  The story may be very straightforward, but Hitchcock was excellent at making even the most ordinary events seem thrilling.  For example, while hiding out in the highlands of Scotland, the protagonist pretends to be a visitor interested in securing a place to stay overnight.  His concealment in the Scottish house is a fairly short scene yet it highlights everything that Hitchcock did best.  Not only is the character on the run from the police and the foreign spies, but he's faced with convincing his benefactor that he isn't having an affair with the man's wife.  These little touches really help demonstrate how a man who had been a normal member of society was now a complete outcast from the world even from those people who know nothing about the spy plot.<br />The acting is uniformly bright and the two leads (who become handcuffed together) have real chemistry.  Their motivations were obviously painstakingly worked out, with neither one of them behaving irrationally.  Madeleine Carroll's character is not won over simply by being charmed by the handsome, Canadian hero, but through careful uncovering of the real facts behind their chase.  Every step along the way seems believable and the annoying movie cliché of people suddenly believing or disbelieving the hero beyond all rational thought is thankfully avoided here.<br />The Tony Curtis introduction is rather bland, and the included trailer for NORTH BY NORTHWEST isn't in terribly great condition.  However, you won't be buying this DVD for the extras - the movie is entertainment enough.
B000002C1W|5.0|What is wrong with you people? This is not as good, and worse than Pink floyd with waters? This is album is phenomenal! Maybe you think i'm crazy, but gilmore is a lot more interesting than waters. Sure, it's a lot different than some of the stuff they released earlier, but that's not a problem. This is an album I can listen to begining to end, few albums are like that(this and Vast - Music for people). If I had to criticize on one track it would be dogs of war. But other than that it's really remarkable. Did anyone else hear elements of The Alan Parsons project?
6305079900|1.0|The movie is great but the DVD version was very disapointing considering it is in Mono. They claim that in the movies it was not in stereo either but with the technology of today they definitely have to re-release this title in with new sound. It is out in other regions, why cant they do it here? I went crazy to find this title new but was lucky enough to get it used at funcoland for 19.99 and it was disapointing
B00004Z459|4.0|Linkin Park is one of the best rap metal bands in today's music.  Their debut 'Hybrid Theory' is a great cd with good hardcore guitar riffs. With vocalist/singer Chester, vocalist/rapper Mike Shinoda, Guitarist Brad, DJ Joseph Hahn and drummer Rob, the band takes metal to new heights.  From the hardhitting opening track &quot;Papercut&quot;(their next single) to the newest single and last track &quot;Pushing me away&quot; the band has a great sound.  They are lacking in some areas that would make them better like guitar solos for Brad or something besides drumming backbeats for Rob.  But now with the addition of Bassist Pheonix in November, the next album should have a deeper sound.  I can't wait.  But to wet you appetite get Hybrid Theory now.
0140868445|5.0|Dylan Baker's extraordinary reading of Grapes of Wrath is amazing! The story, of course, is an all time classic, but what makes this special is the exacting impersonations of each character and the mournful tempo of the read. When I finished this one, I wanted to put in tape 1 and keep on driving.  Highly recommeded.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|This soundtrack rocks!  It's all I listen to now! The sounds were awesome in the movie, so of course the soundtrack would be wonderful to listen to, also.  I can't even listen to \\"Come What May\\" because I'll start crying, but I love all the others.   They're either extremely pretty to listen to (like Roxanne) or else upbeat (like Lady Marmalade) or even fun (like Sparkling Diamonds.)!<br />They left out \\"Spectacular Spectacular,\\" \\"Like a Virgin,\\" and \\"Zidler's Rap.\\"  While Zidler's Rap was cool, and I wish it would be on the soundtrack, the other two were kind of...I don't know the word.  But, while they were an enjoyable part of the movie, they weren't exactly ones I'd pop into my car stereo and listen to.  Needless to say, I certainly don't mind the fact that they were left out, and unless you're an extremely die-hard music fan you won't either.  <br />All in all, it's an excellent soundtrack from a great film.  I love it.
0553277472|1.0|Nothing to do with Zen.  Almost nothing to do with motorcycles.  And contains more ancient philosophy than a college text.<br />Some say ZaMM was autobiographical.  I hope to God that it wasn't.<br />I read it over 15 years ago and HATE-HATE-HATED the book!!!  Between the seemingly endless volumes of philosophy, that lead character was so haunted by Phraedus and his quest for &quot;good&quot; and &quot;truth&quot; and &quot;beauty&quot; that he never opened his eyes to appreciate the world that motorcycling or life in general was bringing to him.  In the first night or two of camping, his son complained of stomach problems.  He ignored the kid, &quot;Go take care of it, son&quot; and then casually mentioned to the other couple that &quot;His doctors say it's psychological.&quot;  No wonder the other couple took off on their own way.  The guy was a total A$$ and a BAD FATHER!  It was a classic example of how his madness made his entire family dysfunctional, and small wonder he wasn't liked by friends that he tried to make.  I slammed that book down several dozen times because I was so angry with him.  (But I was determined to finish it.)  I won't spoil the end for you, but no wonder THAT happens!  And I'm sure the lesson he learned was only temporary...  As you can see, he still makes my blood boil.<br />On a sad note:  Robert Pirsig's son, Chris, was stabbed to death in SF, coming out of a Zen temple in 1979.  I wish with all my heart that he played a more important role in his father's real life than he did in his book.
B000005DQR|5.0|If this album were given to you as a blank disc with no identifying information on it, there's little doubt you'd still love it.  Then imagine if someone told you the album is just one giant remix.  The entire album!  Every sound, every note, and every nuance comes from a very different source.  The whole album is sampled!  Comprehending this is still a little difficult for me.  However, I also realize that this is what makes it a masterpiece.  For all the effort put into this album and for it all to work without it getting muddled and overproduced is stunning.
6304458924|3.0|Occasionally I feel in the mood for a movie that I know is going to be ridiculous, but that I just want to be a couch potato for. No note making. No expectations. No brainpower required. And action thrillers are a good genre for this kind of mindless forgettable entertainment. Plus as I hate flying on planes because it's like being locked in a room for hours, I get a perverse kick out of seeing plane disaster movies. What surprised me about this film, and what I doubt even the makers realise, is that it becomes a two hander, and I was imagining it being done on the stage, if you can imagine a plane set on stage. (But then Nixon in China had a plane). Whilst admitting to not noticing the upstanding martini glass after the plane did its sommersault, one thing no other reviewer has picked up on is the karaoke joke, which made me laugh out loud. And darn it if I wasn't upright for the finale, hoping above all that the plane was gonna make it home safely, and grateful we didn't get the ubiquitous you-thought-I-was-dead, didn't-you? cliche. And did you think we would get a title at the end about someone studying for a new career? The crowd accumulated in the flight tower worried me. I mean, why so many? And imagine poor Hector Elizondo thinking that his part would be important going from the opening scenes, to be then shunted aside. Well he always has director Gary Marshall to work for. As for the acting, well, Helen Hayes may have won an Oscar for Airport, but has anyone else survived their turn with reputation intact? It's always nice to see Lauren Holly run around in her underwear, and I was sure glad to see Catherine Hicks only have a minor part. Some might say considering the performances she's been giving, she deserved to meet a serial killer a long time ago. As for Ray Liotta, I'm only sorry he wasn't given a musical instrument to play.
B00005J6T1|5.0|This album is incredible.  It is funky and bold, it's hot and punk, and it's classic and remastered.  It is unreal that this record is almost 20 years old.  &quot;Madonna&quot; isunbelievably fresh, the songs are reminders of the days when Madonna was just another pop singer.  Before her image overtook her medium.  Before all the nasty names and half baked scandals, Madonna released her debut album, simply titled &quot;Madonna&quot;.  Every song is funky and fun, her only true dance album to date.  It is useless to critique the songs now-they are classics.  &quot;Lucky Star&quot;, &quot;Boderline&quot;, and the super track &quot;Holiday&quot;, along with the club hits &quot;Everybody&quot;, &quot;Physical Attraction&quot;, and the brilliant &quot;Burning Up&quot; all seem too divine to stand up to scrutiny.  The collection has been remastered(duh), and the bonus tracks alone are worth the cash.  &quot;Burning Up&quot; is remolded with a different arrangement, less punk and more dance.  It gives me a Madonna moment.  &quot;Lucky Star&quot; too was retooled back in the day, and finds itself getting high on the funk(funk really is the only word to describe this amazing album).  Easily the best release of the remastered series, and one of Madonna's top albums, &quot;Madonna&quot; proves that even when she was &quot;nobody&quot; she knew exactly how to do it.
B00000IAU3|1.0|This is not trip-hop, nothing near it. Her voice is also nothing but show off... Out of these songs only &quot;Don't Think of Me&quot; (Couldn't find the relationship with &quot;You Oughtta Know&quot;) and &quot;Here With Me&quot; really work...Musically she is mostly like the Corrs (which is not really a good thing) and her optimisim in her lyrics just really annoy me...
B00000AFWW|5.0|I never heard a single song by Courtney Love until my friend let me borrow this Cd. I wont give it back to her now.I am hooked to the don't mess with me lyrics and whinning voice Courtney does so well at. Her songs remind me of Fiona Apple and Alanis Morrisette because they are the one I listen to when I have had a bad day. The Cd was well put together I liked Boys on the Radio, Dying, Petals they all had great music accompaniment.
B00005BJ2O|1.0|Every once in a while, a movie comes along that has that certain something which captures the hearts of the movie's audience.  This particular quality that sets movies of this type apart is not the same in every movie, and is often difficult to define.  Some movies, say, Casablanca, or Titanic, just strike a soft spot in the American psyche.  Moulin Rouge, however, a film that might one day fall in the same category as the aforementioned films, has a more obvious attraction: its music.  Ignoring a decades-long taboo against movie-musicals, director Baz Luhrman takes a bare seedling of a plot and waters it with song to create a stunning garden of sight, sound, and soul.  Indeed, it is the music that brings this film to greatness, and gives it the meaning and splendor to rise above typical Hollywood glam and typical American cynicism.      The album, sadly, takes the music that was the heart of Moulin Rouge and runs it into the ground, or, more accurately, into the arms of your local radio station.  Unlike a standard soundtrack for a musical, which includes more or less verbatim the songs that one hears in the production, this cd cuts numerous memorable numbers in favor of star-studded covers and ill-conceived studio-style numbers.  While the movie's songs, rough-hewn as they sometimes were, had a vital poignancy, the songs on this album, with the exception of the seven songs apparently untouched from the film, are flat and strictly commercial.  Even these seven did not escape the corporate meat-grinder unscathed; for example (and this is only one of many on each track) MacGregor has a new partner in &quot;Your Song,&quot; as well as a annoyingly constant rhythm that lacks all the honesty and true stage-musical &quot;live-ness&quot; that made it so beautiful in the first place.  This and every other track on the cd reeks of the editing room, a place where the soul of music is so often lost.  And that is a shame.      To conclude then, on a happier note, I will say that the songs on this album do have some merit in themselves, though more as radio chart-riders than as pieces of something more meaningful.  However, this soundtrack lacks a heart, lacks coherence, lacks the starry-eyed naivete of the musical.  I wanted a musical, and all I got was a soundtrack.
0385501560|2.0|I'm a fan of Chuch Palahniuk. I've used Fight Club in my freshman level lit class. Unfortunately, Choke confirmed my fears: Chuck P. is a singer of one song (so far, anyway). Other than substituting sex for violence, the themes (and characters) are no different from FC (except FC is far superior). For example, in  Choke, Victor refers to his boss as &quot;His Highness&quot; and &quot;His Lord High.&quot; Tyler uses a similar &quot;tone&quot; when referring to the president of the union: &quot;Mister His Honor.&quot; These comparisons may sound minor, but, reading Choke, I couldn't help but to think of FC and Survivor, to a lesser extent. <br />No new ground is covered here. If you have never read Palahniuk, buy Fight Club or Survivor. This book is little more than a &quot;re-tread&quot; of his previous works but done with less brilliance.<br />I do think that FC is a modern classic. I just hope that the author will move on to new territory and explore some other issues of modern life.
068484267X|5.0|Frank McCourt recounts the deeply moving story of his childhood in Catholic Ireland... an Ireland where bigotted religious zealots make small children feel guilty just for surviving... an Ireland where the Irish detest the English and the Ulstermen, yet are not too proud to take their money off them... an Ireland where the injustice of life is thrust in your face by the tale of a small boy struggling to survive a broken marriage and an alcoholic father.<br />You couldn't fail to read this true story without admiring the spirit of the boy who crawled his way out of the gutter to a better life. His typically Irish sense of humor (and of the absurd) shines through the squalid settings and the dismal truth of the story. You will be touched by his acceptance of burdens that most of us could never even imagine... living in absolute poverty... relying on charity for a pair of boots three sizes too big... collecting scaps of coal that have been ignored by others... always in debt... always cold... always in bad health.<br />We have a lot to be grateful for.
B00005ATQF|5.0|When Saving Private Ryan came out, it inspired a craze for war movies in a many people.  War was hip again.  Of course, Enemy of the Gates came out: a horrible piece of dirt.  So, that's the reason I saw Full Metal Jacket, which in many respects, is just as good as Saving Private Ryan (SPR from now on).  I found myself comparing every war movie to SPR, as if I had exprienced war myself.  But Full Metal Jacket is very different.  Besides from being a different war and different generations, the characters in Full Metal Jacket seemed more effective.  In SPR, the characters were stereotypical, merely representations, I think.  You could compare the character Upham from SPR to Gomer Pyle (beautifully played by the underrated Vincent D'Onofrio).  Gomer Pyle's character is much more dark and disturbing and doesn't find courage in the end.  He shows the horrors soldiers suffer without even going over seas.  The Drill Sergeant at Paris Island is one of the best characters in cinema history next to Wolverine, Greg Focker, anyone in Goodfellas and Tyler Durden.  He is not a D.I. who softens up at the end and really cares for his special, unique soldiers.  He is in their face, intense, fast-talking and even violent in order to make them into killing machines.  Some say that the first half of the movie in the boot camp is the best part; I say they are either lying or fairy tale characters.  The second half that actually takes place in the Vietnam War is wonderful.  The movie follows Matthew Modine's character Joker through out Boot Camp and in Vietnam.  Matthew Modine does a great job as the witty character who is easy to relate with but doesn't have flashbacks of his best friend back home every five minutes.  The movie does a great way of showing his alteration without painting it on a billboard.  My favorite part of the movie is that they all have cool nicknames.  This movie makes the proccess of giving nicknames look really easy.  Speaking of nicknames, the dialogue in thismovie rocks- meaning really good.  It's funny, effective, displays emotions and above all, is realistic.  Especially the D.I.'s scenes.  When you watch other movies D.I.'s, they seem so fake and a guy who calls men 'ladies'.  But the best scene in the movie (in my opinion of course- Amazon), is the last scene which involves an enemy sniper.  It's so neat.  The character Animal Mother's performance here is superb.  Although it's a movie, it still seems heroic.  The music that starts up when they look for the sniper is genious.  It's so eerie and truly shows who Stanley Kubrick was (because we've all met him).  And the very last scene (a big group of soldiers walking in the night singing the theme to the Mickey Mouse Club Show) is awe-inspiring.  You see these nem say and do awful things, but they can still sing corny songs in tune.   To sum it all up, this is one the greatest movies ever made.  You know it's great when so many lines are brutally copied from it without proper recongnition.  Some could say it is better then SPR, but I say it depends what mood you are in.  If you want realistic war with classical moods, go for SPR, but if you want expressionistic depictions with cool nicknames, get a FULL tank of gas, put the pedal the METAL, if it's cold wear a JACKET, and rent that one movie.
B00003CXDG|3.0|Yes, you have to put your brain on hold and suspend your disbelief higher than the cliff Cruise's character dangles from but if you want a movie purely for stunts, you will probably enjoy this one.  The plot may be tired and thread-bare but the movie is a nice filler when you don't want a deep movie but one that just carries you along for a fun ride.  Yes, it's loaded with a bunch of cliche-type elements and characters but some of the stunts truly were exciting and innovative -- even if many of them stretched belief way past the breaking point.  If you want a movie with character depth, heart, unique stuntwork and kick-butt fighting sequences watch Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  If you want testosterone-laden stunts without the bother of needing your brain, this one may just fit the bill.

0788811355|5.0|This is a beautiful film, reminiscent of something by David Lean, and in some ways superior to the book, which more closely concentrated on Kip, the sapper and Hana, the nurse, whereas the film likes the story of Katherine, the spoiled, and Count Alm&aacute;sy, the bitter, better.  I think the film is right for a popular audience.  But essentially they are similar works done in different genres.<br />Although The English Patient won a number of Academy Awards, including best picture and best direction by Anthony Minghella, the public was not entirely pleased.  There are two problems: One, the central love story is not appealing to many people because Katherine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas) is committing adultery and Count Alm&aacute;sy (Ralph Fiennes) is not a sympathetic character.  Two, the structure of the movie with its flashbacks and temporal ambiguities is very demanding on the audience.  Because of this some people found the movie boring.  However, the structure is very well thought out and works well to convey the sense of time during war in which events sometimes happen so quickly that time flies, and at other times the slow pace of days is unbearable.  Additionally the Academy Award winning cinematography by John Seale makes vibrant the expanse and feel of the vast desert setting and the sense of timelessness that the desert can evoke.  And of course the cast was excellent, right down to the supporting players including Naveen Andrews as Kip and J&uuml;rgen Prochnow, whom you may recall as the captain of the Unterseeboot in Das Boot (1981), as Major Muller, and especially Juliette Binoche who won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress as Hana, the nurse.<br />There is some irony here, because had Minghella followed the story and structure of the novel by Michael Ondaatje more closely, the movie would have focused on Hana, and Binoche would have had to win the award for best actress; and Kristin Scott Thomas's part, for which she was nominated, but did not win, for Best Actress, would have been a supporting role.  Also note that in the novel there is a similar disjointedness in the time structure.  Ondaatje worked as though painting in layers, going back to a point and elaborating on it, coming back to a &quot;present&quot; and then going back again and again, and then finally moving forward to the end.  Minghella tried to convey a sense of that structure because it was an important part of the novel, a statement about the subjective nature of our experience of time.<br />By the way, the book disappoints with its phony PC notions about how Kip and some others might have reacted to the atomic bombing of the Japanese cities, the author imagining that Kip would be offended that the bomb was dropped on &quot;brown people&quot; and not on Europeans; but in truth, few at the time really comprehended or cared about anything other than ending the horror of the worst war in human history.  Director Minghella, wisely, I believe, does not bring Kip's notions to the screen.  I was more horrified by the booby trap bombs left behind by the Axis soldiers that Kip had to disarm because they were left specifically to murder people whereas the atomic bombs had at least one clear and laudable purpose: to end the war and to end it as quickly as possible with a minimum of lost life.  It should be added that the firebombing by both sides, in particular the firebombing of Dresden by the Allies, was worse in terms of damage and lives lost than the atomic bombings of the Japanese cities.  It is cliche, but a profoundly true one, to consider once again that war really is hell.Best Actress, would have been a supporting role.  Also note that in the novel there is a similar disjointedness in the time structure.

I was more horrified by the booby trap bombs left behind by the Axis soldiers that Kip had to disarm because they were left specifically to murder people whereas the atomic bombs had at least one clear and laudable purpose: to end the war and to end it as quickly as possible with a minimum of lost life.   It should be added that the firebombing by both sides, in particular the firebombing of Dresden by the Allies, was worse in terms of damage and lives lost than the atomic bombings of the Japanese cities.  It is cliche, but a profoundly true one, to consider once again that war really is hell.
B000001FQI|5.0|This cd is so great! I love every single one of these songs. This cd also introduced the great talent of Oleta Adams. I played this until it was worn out. I don't mean to be corny but they were &quot;sowing the seeds of love&quot; with this one. There is not one song on this cd that is hateful or negative.<br />It is definitely too bad that they decided to split. Perhaps they will get back together in the future but this cd is enough to carry the Tears for Fears name on for years to come.
B00004XQP4|5.0|Just saw the boys live in Chicago, and guess what? The crowd was more into the new songs than the old ones. And that's cause the songs on this CD are great! They closed with song 10 on the CD and then with &quot;Minority&quot; and the place was up for grabs. This is a CD for Green Day fans and everyone else. Clever lyrics, great melodies, and just enough rock. Love it.
B000002MFN|4.0|Madonna is the queen of copy cat's. I love her for it though, she does it so well. She goes to the places that main stream America won't go and sometimes can't go to  collect her data and then adds a few of her special touches and makes it her own before presenting it to us.<br /> With all of the hooplah about the &quot;Sex&quot; coffee table book this cd went under the radar which is too bad because it's actually pretty good. If you don't have this one you may as well get it to complete the set, the cd and the book...I know you have the book.
B000002J1H|5.0|After recording the mediocre album &quot;Relayer&quot; in 1974, it was clearly evident Yes needed a break. Three years later, the versatile prog-rockers returned to the studio. The final output resulted in Yes' most prolific musical work to date - the marvelously well executed &quot;Going For The One&quot;. Perhaps the main element that helped Yes return to its artistic glory, was the return of keyboardist Rick Wakeman, who was the missing piece of the Yes musically dynamic puzzle. The title track definitely sounds like the Yes of old, and starts off the album in high gear. &quot;Turn of the Century&quot; has that classic Yes brand of storytelling written all over it, complete with the opening line: &quot;Realizing (American spelling - sorry!) a form out of stone&quot;, which is, archeologically speaking, a lyrical and musical find, as well as moving, to say the least. Both &quot;Parallels&quot; and &quot;Awaken&quot; feature a pastoral sound, courtesy of the church organ featured in both tracks, particularly in the latter selection, where the organ is featured in the middle stanza. &quot;Wondrous Stories&quot; offers much sageful wisdom, which will leave one feeling all the more knowledgeable even after just one listen. Wakeman's return was definitely the major boost Yes desperately needed after the so-so &quot;Relayer&quot;, but the wonderful Yes wall of sound wouldn't be standing tall much longer, for Rick Wakeman left the band after Yes' next release, the very average &quot;Tormato&quot; (1978). If you're a fan of this great progressive group, and you don't have &quot;Going For The One&quot; in your CD collection, all I can say is, &quot;WHAT? ARE YOU NUTS?!!?&quot;
B000002IZ4|5.0|Wow, what can I say? This CD is one of those CD's that never leaves my 5 CD changer. From Meatplow all the way until Kitchenware and Candy Bars this is a CD that will become a classic for years to come. The best song on the CD would have to be Unglued but I honestly can't choose. If you like slow ballad type songs this CD is for you but if you like fast, fun songs this CD is also for you theres something for everyone and most likley you'll like it all
B000003BDJ|5.0|Well, I am quite satisfied with this purchase. I had bought the Digitally Remastered Version  because I had heard previous reviewers mention poor sound. Although it still has some flaws, it really has a great selection of songs. This is a great cd for a newbie for the Stones, but don't let this be your only Stones purchase. I really wished &quot;Monkey Man&quot; from the Stones hit album &quot;Let it Bleed&quot; could have been on here. It is an awesome combination of guitar riffs, great lyrics, great vocals, and some great piano work, unfortunatley it is a greatly underrated song. The psychedelic &quot;2000 Light Years From Home&quot; would have been a nice touch But I guess &quot;You can't always get what you want.&quot;<br />&quot;Time is on my side&quot; is a great kick-off with &quot;Satisfaction&quot; not so far around the corner. The pill-popping inspired &quot;Mother's Little Helper&quot; gets you ready for your &quot;19th Nervous Breakdown&quot; where &quot;on our 1st trip I tried so hard to rearrange your mind.&quot; And if &quot;Paint It Black&quot; gets you too dark, skip to &quot;Ruby Tuesday.&quot; And that's only the 1st disc.<br />Disc 2 is alright now, infact it's a gas with &quot;Jumpin' Jack Flash.&quot; You'll shout and scream and kill the king with &quot;Street Fightin' Man.&quot; And for the ultimate Stones Rocker, a sin of a song, &quot;Sympathy For the Devil&quot; with &quot;Gimmie Shelter&quot; just a track away. Don't let the boys' choir in &quot;You Can't Always Get What You Want&quot; make you want to skip track, it get's better. Keith lays down an awesome riff that could whip the women just around midnight in &quot;Brown Sugar.&quot; And ending your very awesome CD set, Mick gives an excellent vocal that couldn't be dragged away in &quot;Wild Horses&quot;
B00004S35Z|5.0|Although critics might not agree, I feel that that with the fresh new material and supberb use of exotic and exciting rhythms this is Wonder's finest hour. In the new 24 bit remastering it assumes an intimate immediacy not previously heard.  A word of caution, however.  Just because you order one with the &quot;original recording remastered&quot; claim it does not mean that you will get the remastered version.  The remastered version has a gold label prominantly attached that says &quot;A stevie wonder classic remastered in 24 bit sound&quot;.  Several times of late I have ordered such recordings here and received only the standard CD version.  Of course, you can send them back, but it is a pain in the ***.
B000000H5K|2.0|WAY TO SLOW. MAX TOOK THEM IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. THEY SHOULD HAVE STUCK WITH THE PURE THRASH. MAX IS AN AWESOME SONG WRITER, BUT HE CHANGED IT UP TO MUCH ON THIS ALBUM. BUY BENEATH THE REMAINS AND ARISE.
B00003CXA2|5.0|Finally on DVD! This has to be one of the greatest films I've ever seen. Great special effects and greater acting, Tom Hanks is the best. When it was originally released, I went to see it 3 times in the theaters! There's a reason why this is going to be released as a 2 disc set, that's what the people want, it's a fantastic film that needs to be split onto 2 discs, 1 disc for the movie, another for the special features. You won't be dissapointed purchasing this DVD. I don't know what else to say about this wonderful film. That's why I was a little disturbed to read the review below mine, from someone unfortunately named: &quot;Rivkah Maccaby.&quot; We all love the fact that we can review movies on Amazon, it's really cool to be able to give our own &quot;2 cents&quot; on our favorite movies. In the same respect, it's also fun to trash movies that we don't like, it doesn't matter if the movie deserves it or not, it's just fun. But, if you're going to repeatedly call a movie &quot;stupid&quot; in your review, at least have the brains to explain why you thought it was stupid. Give us some details, some parts of the movie you thought were bad.  Rivkah Maccaby, are you also a filmmaker? Are there any movies that you have made recently? Have you ever heard of the term &quot;I'd like to see you do better&quot;? Can you make a better movie than &quot;Gump&quot;? Probably not, but if you ever make any movies, I would love to review your work so that I can make the same brainless comments as you did on the Gump DVD. The fact is that &quot;Gump&quot; is a brilliant movie that you should buy right now for your home movie collection. But that's just my opinion, one of over 150 reviews so far.
B00002MZ4W|4.0|Wow! this is the most stylish album in my collection ever.The whole album is remarkable.The album opens with Fiona's trademark style song 'On The Bound' wich has the excotic grooves and sharp words.the whole album is full of lethal grooves.My personal favourite is 'To Your Love',its the most stylish song in the album,by the end of the song i feel like gasping for air!.Truly a great performer and a wonderful follow up to her debut 'Tidal'.
B00005B36H|5.0|It may not be for everyone, but I have listened to Tool for a while and I think they are the best band in the business right now.  Having to wait so long for this album made me worry that it would not live up to my expectations, but I was relieved when it did.  It is a different album, it really cannot be compared to Opiate, Undertow, or Aenima.  Lateralus is not as angry as previous albums and looks less at the outside world and more inward to a person's mind, I think it's outstanding.  Even though it is different than the other albums, it still sounds different(and better) than most of the mass produced sludge like Linkin Park, Staind, or Limp Bizkit.
B0000062GE|5.0|Darkest days is one of the best cds of all time. Not only is it gothic,but it's industrial as well. Stabbing Westward is at there best if you don't already have this cd and you are a big Stabbing Westward fan you had better get it because you are missing out. My favorite song is darkest days because i'm sure anyone can relate to it.
B000001Y2U|5.0|Antichrist Superstar, the second LP from Marilyn Manson, is the album that catapulted the band and the man to the international stage in late 1996. Written and recorded by Marilyn Manson and produced by Nine Inch Nails mastermind Trent Reznor during a torturous 8 months of mind experimentation, sleep deprivation and Kabbalistic re-interpretation, ACS is a bizarre, dark, beautiful and thought-provoking concept album. Semi-autobiographical in nature, the sixteen songs follow the transformation of an innocent all-American child into a confused, scared victim of Christian guilt, and then into a megalomaniacal world-destroyer, the Antichrist Superstar, who rails against the tight-lipped moral world that now hates what it, in fact, spurred the creation of.<br />Marilyn Manson has had quite more than his share of detractors, from ignorant Christian organizations who think he is an incarnation of some demon, to hard-core Limp Bizkit types who think he's a hero because he wears make-up. The media even went as far as to blame Marilyn Manson for influencing the Columbine shooters Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, even after it was discovered that the teens, in fact, did not like him. The controversy has only had the effect, in the long run, of drawing more attention to the singer/songwriter and the ideas he presents with his music, an effect that Manson himself predicted long before his sudden fame and most likely helped come about by misleading reporters about his personal life and habits in interviews.<br />Regardless of one's opinion of Manson's beliefs, most intelligent people will have to admit that Manson's well-orchestrated albums have influenced late 90's rock in a big way. His heavy industrial rock sound, combined with truly Satanic lyrics about atheism and self-transformation, have been copied and recopied by countless other bands since. Manson's live shows, also, are an extraordinary experience in the grand old theater sense. Few live bands can compete with the energy,drama, and stage-presence this group presents. <br />Antichrist Superstar is the album that really started it all, and it is also in my opinion the best Manson album to date. Certainly worth the money and then some.
0671024256|5.0|If only I could give more than five stars to this wonderful book! My only complaint is that the book is too short. I want more. Can we have a sequel please?? I've been a King fan since I read &quot;Carrie&quot; at the age of fifteen and found both his writing and his joy in the craft to be an inspiration in my own writing. Now that I've been published, I am often asked who my favorite authors are. King is always in the top three. This book, with its hilarious, touching and insightful glimpses into King's own life, is a real treat. I remain a giddy fan.
B00005BIIP|5.0|If you're already a fan of Porcupine Tree, you probably have hunted down all of the band's singles since they often include unreleased songs.  If you haven't tracked them down--then you're in luck because this album features all of the &quot;other&quot; songs PT have released on their singles.  &quot;Disapear&quot; is a fantastic song--it's suprising it was left off the &quot;Lightbulb Sun&quot; album because it's simply great in so many ways.<br />If you have these songs already, you still need to buy this album since it contains two brand new gems.  And gems they are!!<br />&quot;Buying New Soul&quot; is haunting to say the least.  The opening of the song has a great mellow keyboard melody that carries it into the core of the tune.  A great chorus and great lyrics make this another fine PT song.  The other new tune, &quot;Access Denied&quot; is also great--up tempo with vocal effects.<br />Porcupine Tree can't do wrong; they keep releasing stunning material.  It's safe to say they may be one of the best bands around today.  It's a shame more people haven't found them yet.  That will all change soon.
B00004SCX6|4.0|Okay, I'll admit it. This isn't a great CD, and I'm not a big fan of Britney. But if you forget that it is Britney Spears and just dance to the music, you'll find yourself having a lot of fun. I used to over-analyze, and you know what, that ruins the CD for you.  Don't think about that fact that she doesn't write the music or lyrics (except Dear Diary.)  Don't think about the fact that her voice is somewhat nasal-sounding. Just pop it in the player with friends, by yourself, or at a party and just dance and have fun to it.<br />Not every CD has to be a great work of art that will be a classic CD, such as Led Zeppelin (they kick serious booty! Don't think I'm dissing on them because that is the last thing I would ever want to do!)  Some CD's are just ment to get you jiving and feeling good. That's all I have to say :)
0767903854|5.0|Whether you are traveling to Australia or just curious about the overlooked continent, In a Sunburned Country is a MUST READ! Bill Bryson is a master of storytelling, distilling the most poignant parts of the Australian landscape, people, and culture, and presenting them in a way that is indicative of this often contradictory, but truly wonderful country. Anyone who calls his style of writing &quot;too haphazard&quot; should limit themselves to high school text books, for this book is history, adventure, AND entertainment at its finest.<br />I was slated for a 4 day business trip to Melbourne and took this book along for the 24 hour airplane ride. Although I used my brief stay in Australia to devour every scrap of the culture I could get my hands on, the book gave me a truly complete picture of Down Under--confirming some of my own observations and filling in with rich history and anecdotes that one wouldn't have known, had they spent a month there. Kudos to Bill Bryson for allowing virtual or curtailed travelers a chance to enrich their experiences.

0811826848|5.0|So very many books were written about the Beatles, and so many TV documentries were made about them. Anthology is definitely the best one yet, and I don't think there will ever be another book as complete and sincere as it. For the first time the Beatles tell their own story (yes, even John - material from old intreviews with him are beautifuly collected and edited into the book), along with some help from George Martin, Derek Taylor and Neil Aspinall and some old quotes from Brian Epstein, Mel Evans, Pete Best and others, and that makes Anthology a truly unique experience. The story is told from such a personal viewpoint that you will feel like you're part of the band. George, Ringo, Paul and John will become your closest friends for the period of reading the book.<br />Anthology covers every (well, probably almost every) aspect of the Beatles' life and musical career. It starts as four seperate stories as every band member describes his childhood, then melds into the story of the band. All the interviews from the wonderful Anthology TV series are in the book, but so are many more. There are far more details - especially about the music itself, which was neglected in the series. While in the series some albums were hardly mentioned, in the book the Beatles refer to almost every song, telling a thing or two about its background. Also, more touchy subjects which were avoided in the series appear here - such as, the (phony) death of Paul McCartney, the (real) death of Stuart Sutcliffe, the unfortunate Hell's Angels incident and the terrible case of Charles Manson and his connection to the White Album. The photographs and documents shown in the book are facsinating as well.<br />And no, it's NOT too long. The only problem with the book is its weight, which makes it quite uncomfortable to read. Anthology is a superb book, which reminded me why I used to love the Beatles so much and got me to hear all their albums again - twice.
B00000IAU3|5.0|This woman has a wonderful voice and a her songs are in touch with reality.  Men, you will really score points putting this top notch CD into your player next time you have a lady you want to impress in your company!  The lyrics are soft and yet totally happening!  This is a CD I never get tired of and is a tribute to a wonderfully talented woman. The first song is why I bought it and the rest of it is why I never tire of it, buy it and treat yourself to sexy voice with a great blend of everything that is today.
B00002MZ2C|4.0|Although Evil Empire is my favorite RATM CD,I think that this one is very well done.  Morello is his usual brilliant self, and the lyrics are also very powerful, even if de la Rocha needs to learn to sing.  Rage is my favorite band and this CD has done nothing to tarnish their reputation.  Guerilla Radio is my favorite song on it, followed by New Millenium Hopes.  If you like Rage or hard rock/metal, buy this CD today!
6304493681|5.0|I m not gonna write much....cept its a manga MUST...simple...if you like animated adult movies, and especially mangas you just have to watch the movie as its required watching for any cyberpunk, manga lovin freak :) <br />You wont regret it :)
B00005LB9O|5.0|I bought this album today, and I've already listened to it straight through... immediately I love all the songs... the music is soft and melodic, like The Man Who, although maybe a bit moreso, and that is a good thing... This is not an album to put on and jump around screaming, but rather is an album for sitting and enjoying... the music is so beautiful, and the lyrics are playful as someone has already pointed out, but they are still very good... I find that the music on this album draws me in, it's very hypnotic... The melodies are catchy, and there will definately be some good singles here... Overall the album is like The Man Who, but is different, and also much better... The music is more expansive, and overall the songs are of better quality, and are utterly beautiful... while The Man Who is a good album is very very good songs, I find that some of that album is mediocre... This album however is great all the way through... this is definately a must have album if you can appreciate music that you have to actually listen to to enjoy...
B00005AAFS|5.0|What was started in Herzeleid and improved in Sehnsucht is now perfected in Rammstein's latest album, Mutter. The album contains some very powerful guitars and fast-paced vocals. While some of the songs sound the same, it is good that way because they are all great.<br />In my humble opinion, Adios, Sun, Left 2-3-4, My Heart Burns and Mother are the best songs on the album. If you don't own anything by Rammstein, buy this album first. No Rammstein fan should be without this album.
0385335482|5.0|This fantastic and hysterical book is a great follow up for any Bridget Jones fanatic. Becky Bloomwood is a funny character that any recent college grad can relate to. The writing is sharp and witty and I was constantly laughing out loud when I was reading this great story! Enjoy - and tell your friends!!
B000059R8Y|5.0|I have followed blues and jazz for many years. What I like about jazz is the way you can pick out styles of artists. Many play on each others songs and it is a great collaboration. Eric has done this on Reptile. The credits read like a &quot;who's who&quot; of music. The combinations of Billy Preston, Stevie Gadd, Nathan East, Joe Sample, Paulinho DaCosta, to name a few, makes you wonder what  the overall sound will be. I found it incredible. From James Taylor's &quot;Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight&quot; to Stevie Wonder's &quot;I Ain't Gonna Stand For It&quot; and beyond, the sound is strong and blended excellently. My favorite....?  &quot;I Want A Little Girl&quot;. Just a fun little ditty that is nightclubish yet rock n roll bluesish!  I recommend this album highly, there's something for everyone on it.
B00004W5UA|5.0|there is just about NOTHING i can say here that doesn't reiterate one of the other 760 or so reviews in some fashion, but i'd like to add a few things i didn't see in the first 150 reviews<br />i think the advertisement campaign was actually quite clever. they market it as a &quot;boxing, brawling, sweaty guys beating eachother up&quot; film, but then they release a bombshell of poignant observation about American hypocrisy and materialism. i'm betting that -=*MOST*=- of the people who reviewed this movie at 1 star are close minded ultra-conservative Christians. this movie was apparently aiming to change some minds at SOME capacity, but fell short of that. oh well.<br />this is a movie for those &quot;out of the box&quot; (not in corporate terms, doofus)<br />i don't swear by the movie and take every single line that Mr. Durden spews straight to my heart, i simply sit back and say &quot;i'm glad somebody said it&quot;.<br />i don't expect this review to be very helpful<br />also the movie did produce an amusing running joke &quot;the first rule of worship is...you do NOT talk about worship, the second rule of worship is...you do NOT talk about WORSHIP...&quot;
0453005071|5.0|Once again, this brilliant author has brought forth a collection of stories which prove that he does not simply write horror, and that his boundaries go far and wide. Unfortunately, it's hard to find all four of these novellas in a complete collection, due to censorship reasons, but if you can get your hands on all of them in this single volume, I would advise you not to hesitate. Built up from four different stories; &quot;Rage&quot;, &quot;The Long Walk&quot;, &quot;Roadwork&quot;, and &quot;The Running Man&quot;, King has expanded on his ability to examine the human mind and the very essence of sanity in &quot;Rage&quot; and &quot;Roadwork&quot;, while looking at the future in a new light that seems too possible, almost to the point of terrifying in &quot;The Long Walk&quot; and &quot;The Running Man&quot;.<br />The first novella, &quot;Rage&quot;, is the one and only reason that it is so difficult to find all four of these stories in a single volume, being the only one that wasn't re-printed and individually published. Banned from bookshelves due to censorship, this story seems to prophesize down to the finest points all the tragic school shootings which have taken place, even though it was written in the 1970's, far before such a thing was hyped up. Based around the main character Charlie Decker, the reader watches as his sanity slowly slips away and drives him to execute teachers at his high school, resulting in taking his math class hostage in a vicious standoff with the police force. Although the story may sound violent, predictable, and inappropriate depending on your opinion, it proves to be more than just violence and mindless bloodshed. As the class is held hostage, both Charlie and his classmates engage in a series of flashbacks and events looking back on life, each learning something about themselves. A very good read, by far, which should be re-printed. If censorship starts here, where does it end?<br />&quot;The Long Walk&quot;, which follows &quot;Rage&quot;, is definitely the best of these four stories, and one of the two based around futuristic game shows played on violence, simply to entertain the brainwashed masses of America (along with &quot;The Running Man&quot;). The rules of the game shown in the story are simple. One hundred boys from the ages of 14-18 are to begin walking at the U.S/Canada border. With chronometers attached to them, they are to keep their pace above 4 miles an hour at all times. Every time one of them drops under this pace, they are issued a warning. If, after three warnings, the pace drops again, the boy is executed by soldiers armed with high-powered carbine rifles. The suspense and constant wondering of who is going to die next haunts this tale. As the plot thickens and the game starts to enter it's second and third day of straight walking, empathy sets in and the reader feels like they are among the characters, back and feet in pain from the constant work. One thing which is not mentioned about this story much is the Vietnam metaphor, reflecting how the country sends their best young men off to die, only a small number ever to return, and then pushed beyond their sanity if they survive long enough. Various other metaphors exist, but are purely speculative.<br />The third novella, &quot;Roadwork&quot;, was excellent, but my least favorite of all. All of the plot revolves around the main characters fall from sanity, just as in &quot;Rage&quot;. Barton Dawes, the main character, watches as the government tries to tear his house down to build a freeway extension, his only child dies from a brain tumor, he loses his job, his wife leaves him, and he is left with no options. The story moves too slowly at first, and their isn't much action until the final pages of climax, but the characters are believable and the plot is original, similar to the film &quot;Falling Down&quot;. The only real complaint is the fact that the story is extremely long, but only about the last 10 pages, give ortake, are used to show the final steps of Barton's sanity disappearing. However, don't let that stop you. After getting into it, the story really grabs you, whether it's loaded with action or not.<br />&quot;The Running Man&quot; finishes off this volume, telling the tale of Ben Richards, a poor man whose little girl is dying of pneumonia, as he enters a game show where he has 30 days to flee bounty hunters across the world, with all of society able to turn him in for money. If he is caught, he is brutally executed to entertain middle class America on television. If he escapes the whole 30 days, there is a billion dollar jackpot waiting for him. The end is completely unpredictable and keeps you in constant suspense. If you're going to compare it to the film, don't bother. The film is good action, but weak compared to this. The story simply grabs you in the first paragraph and doesn't let go, even after the ending.<br />All four stories are excellent, even though the endings of &quot;Rage&quot; and &quot;Roadwork&quot; are a bit predictable. As far as &quot;The Long Walk&quot; and &quot;The Running Man&quot; go, they are some of the best suspense you'll ever read. Looking at modern television, with &quot;survival&quot; game-shows such as &quot;Survivor&quot;, &quot;The Mole&quot;, and &quot;Bootcamp&quot;, along with a million other clones, the reality of game shows based around death seems all too near. Frightening and exhilarating to think about. A must-have for any King fan.
B000059R8Y|2.0|If you've liked any of Clapton's work in past 25 years, you'll like Reptile. Same thing, new package. There's no question that Clapton is talented guitarist (wildly overrated, but talented) and still fairly interesting for the 40+ set who still think he's &quot;groovy&quot; much in the way the previous generation thought Liberace was &quot;one hep cat.&quot; Aside from the well-executed Son &amp; Sylvia, this is a fairly predictable, paint-by-numbers exercise.<br />If you don't have a lot of exposure to Clapton, do yourself a favor and check him out in his prime (30 years ago folks!) with Derek and the Dominos during the &quot;Layla&quot; era or 461 Ocean Blvd. There's a lot of great Clapton out there. Virtually all of it is pre-1980.
0802130208|5.0|Take this easy test: If you don't like this book, you have no sense of humor worth mentioning. If you love it, you can use this hilarious novel as a litmus for testing the sense of humor of potential spouses, mates, friends, classmates, employers, etc. (In general, anal types and neat-freaks will hate it.) Ignatius J. Reilly is one of the towering comic creations, right up there with Sancho Panza and Falstaff. Another source of delight is how Toole skewers the entire Sixties ethos that was just coming into being at the time of his writing.
0553278223|5.0|Ray Bradbury's &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot; is, in my opinion, one of the indispensable classics of 20th century science fiction. The book tells the story of human colonization of Mars--a Mars marked by the remains of a dying indigenous civilization. One can read the book as a metaphoric meditation on human history, or as a straightforward tale of an alternate reality. But however you approach it, the book is brilliant.<br />&quot;Chronicles&quot; consists of a series of interrelated short stories. The overall feel of the book is that of an epic saga, but it is an epic told in brief, intimate fragments. Particularly fascinating are the tales which capture the complex relationships between the human colonists and the native Martians.<br />&quot;Chronicles&quot; is at times whimsical, at times painful, at times ironic. But Bradbury's vision is always rich in compassion and insight. This is truly one of those science fiction masterworks which both transcends and ennobles the genre. Don't miss it.
B00005B36H|5.0|I can only say that this is a truly great ROCK album!  Easily the best I've heard in years.  It is a must purchase for any ROCK fan and if you decide, after listening, that you don't like it, that would explain exactly what is wrong with this world.  Don't be selfish after you buy it, be sure to share it with a friend or many friends for that matter.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|This stuff is really great! I love the music, it's some of the best &quot;clean&quot; music I've heard. There's hardly any cussing/dirty stuff in it. I would really recomend this to any one!
0553106635|1.0|Thats the only reason I can think that this author continues to write this series.  He certainly isn't doing it for you the reader.  He is almost as bad as Jordan and others who prolong a series for no apparent reason.  His characters are for the most part shallow individuals whom he cant keep consistent changing their basic selves at a moments notice.  He rambles somtimes incoherently as he leads you from subplot to subplot without the ability to tie them together.  While the first book was...okay, the second began the descent and now this claptrap brings you to the nethermost region of readers hell.  I can't understand how anyone would rate this above 1 star (I gave it 1 only because there is not a no star button).  I have been searching for years for a good series of fantasy, but have only found individual novels that meet my standard, that would hold me, and draw me in as only the masterpiece has done in over 35 years of reading fantasy.  If you are pleased with this book (God help you), if you are pleased with the work of Jordan, Eddings, Brooks or Goodkind go back to basics and re-read (or God forbid read for the first time) The Lord of the Rings and remember how 1st class literature/fantasy is supposed to be written.
0440180295|5.0|This is one of the best anti-war books I've read. The \\"unstuck in time\\" dilemma(read the book to see what that is) the hero is forced to endure is fascinating and adds to an already engrossing story about the tragic bombing of Dresden during World War 2. A great introduction to Vonnegut's works and,unfortunately, very timely as well..
B00003CXQY|5.0|Personal, I was a bit sceptic at first, because of the change of story we all heared of, but 'the groove flik' is very very entertaining. You'll enjoy this movie time and time again. A little bit unusual humor for Disney standards, but that's even more fun. Very brightly colored and fast-paced sometimes very subtile and almost to quick to follow for one time viewing. Its a hilarious picture with no 'mushi Disney' sause. No lovestory, but very loveable.  In a 1.66:1 aspect ratio (widesreen anamorphic) and with THX sound, it is as sharp and bright as a DVD gets. The animated menu's are even groovy and funny! The DVD Collectors edition is truly a teasure of information. The only thing is, it is presented in a childish way. That's too bad, because touring the Disney Pictures Movie Studio's is normally impossible. We see all the stages of animation and a lot of additional information.  For me it is an animation I'll see and see again.
B00003CXQY|5.0|This movie is fantastic and humourous.  There is as much fun in the movie for adults as for the children.  David Spade is his cynical best as the voice of Kuzco as is John Goodman's character Pacha the llama herder.<br />As for extras available on this set I am suitably impressed.  Disk 1 provides the fab movie and a DVD rom game which provides some light entertainment.  Disk 2 is packed solid behind the scenes footage covering the complete development of this movie from a good idea down to the publicity surrounding the release.<br />While there have been some complaints about the quality of the cut of this DVD, I have experienced no such problems.  Studios are always improving encryption on discs to combat pirating and keep DVDs within their zones.  As a result of this I am aware of some 'Zone Free' players being unable play enhanced discs (ie Gladiator).  In the end really - the responsiblity comes down to the owner insuring they have a decent quality player - isn't quality the reason for buying DVDs in the first place?
B000053VAF|5.0|I siffted through and read many of the reviews about this movie here, and I did not se anyone elude to the whole overall point of this movie.  All of the people who went to that church to have all of their sins forgiven so they could start over and one day be welcomed into heaven were all killed.  There is no easy way out, so be good.
B000059XUI|2.0|When I first saw Superman II as a kid back in the summer of '81, I thought it was great. Superman vs the three villains from Krypton. But as a young 10 year old, I was too young to understand what made a great movie so great or what was 'good acting'. I thought this sequel was better than the original. <br />Fast forward to 2001 and I'm all grown up now and how I realize I was so wrong. I still get a kick out of the comic book style fighting scenes and story, but compared to the original Superman II is not as good. Now that I found out about the whole Richard Donner/Salkinds controversey, I'm even more incensed over this film. Having said that, I know that Donner's II would have been a much better movie since it would be without director Richard Lester's emphasis on campy and cheesey stuff. (By Superman III, COMPLETELY directed by Lester, we can see that the bad scenes in 'II' were all Lesters and the good stuff was Donners).<br />Even after all that, the DVD version just lacks in comparsion to the SE of Superman the Movie. Maybe Warners never cared for the sequels or maybe because they just didn't want to re-open a can of worms.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|I can't begin to describe the feeling I got when I left the theater.  Not to mention the next 5 times! It's truely one of my most favoite movies of all time.  It's a must see!
B00003CXRP|5.0|Great movie.  Depspite long spans with out dialogue, it doesn't get boring
B00000JCB2|1.0|The music is catchy I'll say that. But you only need one song to hear the whole album. EVERY SONG HAS THE SAME BASIC GUITAR RIFF. Limp Bizkit found success in one song and they duplicated it. There is very little musical talent here.
B000005ALN|4.0|George Michael may have personal issues but he is an exceptional artist.  He sings what he loves and it shows.  This CD shows his fans his own voice without the overcrowding of synthetic beats.  The intruments complement his sometimes cliche lyrics and he gets his point across.  If you want to chill out to some good vocals, pick up this CD and enjoy it.
B000003S0I|5.0|Having this album done live several times over on the Great Deciever Box Set made me hold off from buying this, But the beautific CD re-packaging won me over.  As every live version of these songs are different this album makes a great companion to that set as we hear them in their original studio forms. LTIA part one is looser than it's live version and has great added percussion sections and meandering middle that gets replaced by a Cross/Fripp duet in the live versions.  It is very hard to decide which version of any of these songs I like better. Of course there is no version that beats the studio Book of Saturday with the backwards guitar and violin solo.  For some strange reason Cross seems to forget to pick his violin up in time for his solos live. There is always this big gap where you feel something is suppose to happen but doesn't.  But when he does play it sounds so sweet and amazing. He makes this band incredibly unique. Animal sounds introduce Exiles which has dramatic pauses, acoustic guitar and piano flourishes, making it very different from the harder edged live versions.  This album also features what I consider the cartoon version of Easy Money with all the looney toons sound effects but that earie doll laugh at the end is pretty chilling. Percussion really makes this album. Talking Drum with the wind and animal sounds builds into the climatic LTIA part 2 with all those abstract power chords and clanging chains.  The whole album flows together really well making this one of the most unique and satisfying releases I have ever heard.
6302732875|5.0|Some of the best individual performances ever seen. How did they get so many great actors in one movie? I must have seen it 20 times... I think I'm obsessed with this movie.   Do you know what it takes to sell Real Estate?
B00004UEDQ|5.0|I wasn't sure how much I would like this movie about rehab, but I was pleasantly surprised. I thought Sandra did great in this movie. It was a feel-good movie.
6305313687|4.0|As always Edward Norton proves he's a powerful actor. The story is extremely powerful and disturbing... but the question remains would it succeed to put an end to racism?!!<br />If I want to discuss my opinion about the movie, I'd say it is a well-done powerful disturbing movie that I recommend watching! It may not be suitable for some because of some violent scenes but at least there is a good cause behind this movie.<br />The story of this movie can be applied in most (if not all) countries in the world. Wherever there is hate, there is racism. And wherever there is racism, there is hate and all leads to a society weakness.<br />The main point that I think the film missed to present was RELIGION! All religions, emphasized on loving each other whether it was Islam, Christianity or any other. All stressed on peace and love... but it is us (mankind) who start hatred and wars. The film should have presented that all of this hate was developed because of lack of faith!!!
6304712936|4.0|an excellent film with great performances...F. Murray is sensational and Hulce is terrific but the film is a bit too long but well worth a viewing...
B00005BL2A|5.0|The album is excellent. I think it's one of the best in their career. The lyrics are not as depressing as in &quot;Songs of Faith...&quot; and &quot;Ultra&quot; and the sound is very different. And I absolutely don't mind their lyrical cliches: who cares? it's their choice. I think &quot;Comatose&quot; is the worst track because it's distrubing and the sound is irritating. The rest is just brilliant. I can't have enough of them, I just listen and listen and listen to this album.
B00005ARDC|5.0|I saw them live 2 weeks ago. They were great. I went out and bought the album. I love it. That's all there is to say about it. You either like it or you don't. Enough already of this pretentious psychobabble written by a bunch of teenage Rolling-Stone-Editor-Wannabees, comparing every band to some other band and calling them copycats. EVERYONE IS INFLUENCED BY SOMEONE ELSE!!  GET OVER IT!
6305079250|3.0|Boring and stupid rendition of Poe stories. The only acceptable one is by Fellini, but it also shows the vacuity of the time when it was shot and is not a work of art. Fot the other stories the only point of interest is about a very young Brigitte Bardot's partial nudity.
0425152251|5.0|Very unique.  By teaching the ideas of the great Western philosophers into a fictional story setting, it keeps us engaged.  That is not sufficient however; his synopsis on each philosopher's thought is extremely excellent for being concise.<br />These features make this the best introduction to the history of philosophy and thus, philosophy itself, that I know of.  What a great method to let more people know about the great thoughts that came before us, and to see the connections and roots of the ways we see the world today.
6305546789|5.0|In a word - Magnificent.  This is the least gory film in the series, so it is not a gross-out movie.  Probably has the best acting in a horror movie to date.  Michael Myers, is what makes the movie, you can't have a decent slasher without a great slasher.  Just look at Edge Of The Axe, the worst slasher ever. As you know Jaime Lee Curtis plays Laurie Strode, a babysitter who gets stalked by the boogeyman.  Even though everyone that I know has seen this movie, you may not have so I won't ruin anything.  Anyway the DVD is awesome.  It is loaded with extras which are enough to keep you bust for hours.  I've been a fan of the film and the series forever. This movie set the standard for horror movies such as Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street.  However the Halloween movies are better that the 2 mentioned before.  If you're wondering if you should buy this movie or not, stop wondering it's a great movie and a great DVD, so buy it now!
B00005B36H|5.0|Ok first things first, Lateralus is simply breathtaking. I have met maynard on 3 seperate occasions, and you can see how he is in person is reflected in his lyrics and singing. People say this album is mediocre, and all this...(stuff), well hey, everyone is entitled to their opinion. I have introduced tool to well over 100 people over the past year, and I will always be an advocate of tool, but I do realize not everyone will like it. And hey, that's perfectly ok. But I have become so connected to tool, that every song I hear, even off of opiate or salival, I get goosebumps, cause I can feel the emotions in the music they convey. It comes from opening my mind, exploring and being an introspective person. You have to want to open your mind rather listen to something catchy like the new sugar ray song. I like all kinds of music, but tool is by far the best music I listen to. Give lateralus a listen, it may take a few listens, if you like it great, if not, that's fine too. This music if for people who appreciate the art of music as opposed to just the sound of it. Enjoy this masterpiece, it is as good as the other 4 tool albums.
0694003611|5.0|I bought this book for my son when he was 6 months old.  He loved the rhythm of the words and wonderful pictures.  He is two years old now, has memorized it, and reads it to me every night before bed.  I wish there were more books like this one!
B00005B4GU|5.0|They are really making clear what the hell is going on in Amnesiac.  I think it is time that everyone started realizing what they are telling us.  And no, it does not concern money or matter.  Now is the time.
0767903862|5.0|There are some people who can describe things the way it is and Bill Bryson is one of those people.  Although not Aussie born, i have lived here for several years and returned after an absence of a over 15 years- it is interesting to note the authors comments on the country and certainly how it is changing (or is it?). Travelling around with Bryson is as it really is..his descriptions are brilliant, the places he describes one can relive if one has been there and one looks forward to visiting the places he describes that one hasn't.<br />Save for the lack of more detailed descriptions of the bigger cities which will no doubt follow in his new book, this book is a gem for the local traveller and foreign visitor alike.  Some very interesting facts obviously a lot of research, and a great arm chair trip around...I can't wait for the full length feature film.  Bryson is masterful
B00005LMBK|5.0|I think this is definetly the best CD of the year so far.it blends a mix of hip hop and rock.The hit single CLINT EASTWOOD is a great song and Del the homosapien's rapping ability is amazing.i could listen to this CD over and over all the songs are awesome except number 7.My favorite song is gravity it starts out slow and then it picks up with a sweet piano part.Go out and by this disc i promise you will be pleasently surprised.The gorrillaz disc doesnt get much air time but it definetly should.
B00005JG6R|5.0|If you are an anime fan, but have not seen this movie, then you are not an anime fan.  This is the most famous anime movie ever, and the best.  I recommend this movie to anyone who likes to see a good movie.  It is rated R, but dosn't have a lot of greatly objectionable material.  The end is kind of gross, but this is a science-fiction movie.  Parents may want to watch it with the youngsters, but should not have to monitor too closely.  You don't have to be an anime fan to enjoy Akira.  I want you to buy this, watch it, and love it.
0060392886|5.0|What can you say about one of the most important heavy metal bands in history?  VH1's Behind the Music only touches on some of the stuff they went through.  The Dirt &quot;injects&quot; you with all the goodies of being in this or any rock band(a dream of many).  THE GIRLS, THE DRUGS, THE LIVES of the members are detailed so well that you feel like you were there.  This book keeps the reader reading the moment it is picked up.  A great read and buy!
6305910103|5.0|pehaps because it is closest to the original series.  It is like one long episode, a continuation of the TV story, and it works very well like that.  There is the evil Kahn - genetically engineered and hence an alternative human race line - and the devious Kirk, who relies on his team to defeat him.<br />The other films were often too ambitious or over-burdened with pretention.  (In the first one, Spock sums it up by saying &quot;we may have witnessed the next step in our evolution&quot;.  I mean, sheesh!)  But this one just tells a good yarn.  It is a pity that the others aspired to more than the medium could sustain.
6303921248|5.0|I loved this movie! It was wonderful. The chemistry between Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle is awesome. A great Jane Austen adaptation!

B00000J9HE|3.0|The highlights of this collection are undoubtedly the climaxes. These include the first movement of Symphony No. 5, and the climax near the end of Symphony No. 7.  No other conductor has ever in my experience equalled Karajan in his ability to build up and sustain a powerful momentum in this kind of music.<br />Unfortunately, a lot of Sibelius does not consist of climaxes, and in general I find these performances poorly recorded, somewhat sloppily played and sluggishly conducted. Let's start with the engineering.  The DG balance engineer was obviously a brass fan: the brass instruments totally dominate the sound picture when they have a forte.  On the other hand, the woodwind sound small and distant.  This order of priorities:  first brass, then strings, then finally woodwind is particularly unfortunate in these symphonies, where woodwind play such an important role.  Karajan got much better engineering on both his earlier and later Sibelius cycles (both on EMI, though the later one is only available in Japan).<br />A more important problem concerns Karajan's direction.  Tempi are generally on the slow side and the overall feeling is one of lack of involvement.  The presence of wrong notes also adds to the impression that Karajan and the Berliners just did not care enough about this music at this particular time (and I emphatically do *not* say that about Karajan's Sibelius in general).<br />If you are tempted by this double-CD offering, I would suggest instead Bernstein's similar collection with the New York Philharmonic.  Bernstein's 4th is a disaster (it's even fun to peruse the wreckage), but his 6th and 7th are both the best I have ever heard, and his 5th is also highly regarded.  I would also recommend Karajan's earlier Sibelius (2, 4, 5, 6, 7) with the London Philharmonia orchestra, and his later Berlin EMI cycle (1, 2, 4, 5, 6), both of which feature a more involved Karajan, better playing, and better engineering.  These will involve more outlay and (in thecase of the later cycle) more effort to obtain, but it's well worth it.
B000002H6C|5.0|I remembered how Guitar Player magazine reviewed this album, \\"Back breaking!\\" I totally agree!! In the heavy part of \\"Blackened\\", the band becomes one and is the heaviest, most violent force I've ever heard. The title track is a musical masterpiece, \\"One\\" became a radio hit while still maintaining integrity, and \\"Harvester Of Sorrow\\" delves into James' mind regarding personal struggles. Incredible! It's sad to say, but I think Cliff's death had a lot to do with this album being so powerful & brutal. Personal turmoil seems to bring the best out of musicians. Better than \\"Puppets\\"! (Yes, I really think that)
B000002U82|3.0|Hey, what's wrong with the music community ! Haven't we talked enough of this album ? Though it's a good album, but it is definitely over-rated. This CAN'T be the best album of all times ? Being a true PF fan myself (collected all albums except the newer ones from Div Bell onwards) I definitely disagree that this is the best. Yes, in those days PF may be one of the first to use all kinds of electronic gadgetery, but that does not warrant it being the best. I wonder why most praise it like god, probably cause the others are doing it so ! Just follow the crowd ?<br />Well, compared to other PF albums, to me this lie at the lower rung ! I mean this album lacks good melodies, and drags too long on monotonous tunes, like on Us &amp; Them and Any Colour You Like. The best PF albums in order would be Wish, Animals, Wall, Atom Heart, Saucerful, Piper, More, Dark Side, Meddle, Momentary Lapse, Obscured, Ummagumma and Final Cut.
B000056K04|4.0|&quot;Everday&quot;, to me, is just another evolution of the independent section of modern music that is the Dave Matthews Band.  Critisized as &quot;untrue to the DMB form&quot;, this album has been slandered by many critics and fans.  That statement in itself confuses me--how can a band with no accurate label be untrue to their form?  This is just another example of the DMB's versatility.  Play the album a few times--it'll grow on you.  No, it does not surpass the cryptic lyrics of Under the Table and Dreaming, and it does not compare with a live performance, but it's good for what it is.
6305909326|2.0|so the previews looked all like interesting and stuff, but uh, really the movie goes on and on and on...and then when you get to the end...nothing.<br />all that fill in for a lame non eventful ending..worth renting if you really must see it, but reall you'll live if you miss it.
B00004XOWM|1.0|Oh my God, are we supposed to take Limp Bizkit serious? I will admit that 3 Dollar Bill was a good album but that's when LB was still genuine and Fred was humble & a nobody. Now Fred's still a nobody who thinks he's somebody that EVERYBODY should listen too. Go back to doing tattoos. Please burn that red ball cap! I actually feel kinda sorry for the guys who play in the band because they are ok musicians at best who are hanging on to dear life just for the ride. Here's some advice, change your name and never admit to being in LB. Maybe you'll have a chance. Fred, however, is doomed to be pudgy for eternity falling into the same status as Andrew Dice Clay & Joey Buttafuco.....

B000002N1E|4.0|After releasing a three disc compilation (which was a commercial disaster, stalling at platinum status), changing his name to a symbol, releasing the most hyped album of the 80's in 1994 (which didn't exactly live up to the hype), and releasing a final Prince offering (the lackluster &quot;Come&quot;), Prince made an artistic and commercial comeback in 1994 with the huge hitsingle &quot;The Most Beautiful Girl In The World&quot;. A year later, in 1995 he released &quot;The Gold Experience&quot;, but although the album received positive reviews it failed to catch fire commercially, stalling at (the almost appropriate) gold status. This is really a shame, since this is his best effort of the 90's, easily blowing away such later releases as the lackluster &quot;Newpower Soul&quot; and the slightly stronger &quot;Rave Un2 The Joy Fantastic&quot;. A lot of the tracks on this album are really enjoyable, most notably the powerful fuzzrocker &quot;Endorphinemachine&quot;, the wonderful pop rocker &quot;Dolphin&quot; and the anthemic &quot;Gold&quot;, which strangely reminded me of both &quot;Purple Rain&quot; and &quot;Hey Jude&quot;. There are some weaker moments on this album (&quot;Now&quot; and &quot;Shhh&quot;), but the good moments more than make up for that. An excellent album from one of the most exciting hitmakers of the 80's/early 90's.... Now if he'd only just bring back Wendy &amp; Lisa....
B00003CXP1|5.0|Ellen Burston should have gotten best actress without a doubt. Her performance in this movie is completely astonishing. I demand a recount! Other performances are great as well (even marlon) in this visually assaulting movie about addiction and its triumph over the human spirit. First time i saw it i put it in the top 10 of movies ive seen. After watching it again its top3 for sure. DO NOT mISS THIS! SHOW THIS TO YOUR TEEN WHOS EXPERIMENTING WITH DRUGS. Theyll quit!
B00003CXE7|5.0|When I first saw this movie, I was truly amazed. This was one of the best movies of 2000 from the battle for Germany lead by Maximus to the final battle between Maximus against Commodus the Emperor of Rome. Australian Russell Crowe has done an outstanding performance as Maximus and I soon learned that he did his own stunts in that movie. That is unbelievable but true. It truly deserved Oscars for being the #1 movie in America. One star for powerful story, One star for great action, One star for brilliant acting by Russell Crowe, one star for spectacular visuals of Rome, and one star for all the hard work that Ridley Scott did to make this movie a success.<br />5 stars is my rating and there is no good reason why you cannot rate this movie one star. (Unless you are a Roman historian!)
0452282152|4.0|This book has likable characters and an interesting plot that keeps you intrigued until the end.  The reading is very quick and entertaining.  Perfect for a hot summer day.
0140143505|5.0|This slim little volume is simply wonderful.  Ms. Hanff is wity, generous, and has a &quot;peculiar taste in books.&quot;  Her insights on some of the books she reads are off-beat and delightful.  A must read for any book lover.
B000059XUO|5.0|The first time I remember walking out of a movie theater being totally impressed was when I saw the theatrical release of The Crow.  I bought it as soon as it came out on video, have watched it a number of times since then and still am not tired of it.  This is a dark, elegant, violent, hopeful and above all excellent film that I wish would not be marred by the death of Brandon Lee.  It is not for everyone, but I definitely think everyone of age should at least give it a chance.
B00003CXDG|4.0|I don't seem to understand why many people seem to underate this movie. Mission Impossible 2 is a pretty good movie from the scene where Ethan Hunt climbs up the Arizona rocks to the scene where he fights the enemy at the beach. However, the story is not well developed. Not much action, too much talking and less locations. The movie is mainly set in Australia. It could be more interesting if there were more places to travel. The good things that I liked about this movie is that this movie is like an American version of James Bond 007. And of course, I think James Bond is the coolest secret agent to stop terrorists. It's less complex than Mission: Impossible 1 because after seeing that movie, I was baffled and had to see it six times to get the full meaning if it. I reccomend this movie if you like James Bond.
B00003CX5P|3.0|...so you can fast-forward through to the good parts. I enjoyed watching this film in the theatres, but most people have the right idea about this film: That it was a big money-making operation. There is a lot to like about this film: The light sabre fight scenes were great, the Pod Racing scene was great, the scenes in Coruscant were amazing and there were three or four other parts that I loved. But the Jar-Jar stuff, in fact all the Gungan characters were silly and annoying. That one character, coupled with the depiction of droids WE would'nt use to fight wars, took alot away from the film.
B00004TL21|4.0|Deftones is VERY difficult... I really do like it but I don't understand some of their songs. Like Elite, it's a piece of .... Why would they do something like that, as well as Korea. But I still had to give it 4 stars because Knife Party, Digital Bath and RX Queen are couple of the most greatest melodic rock I've ever heard. It's a shame that Change isn't included in this album, but nevertheless, for those few songs this is a must-buy.
0671618601|5.0|The tape and the book are excellent material.  This should be required reading in high school.  The quality of the tape is poor at best.  <br />The tape plays 2 tracks at the same time thru part of the recording on any tape player I play it on.
B00003CXSP|4.0|Let me say it first &quot;The book is better&quot;. But if you judge this film on its own merits then it deserves 4 stars. This is a very good looking film. I love Ridley Scott films, his attention to detail and the way every scene is so well designed in this film is wonderful. Yes, the film is gory in spots but so is Harris' book. <br />The only problem with the movie is that Scott did not spend more time revealing Hannibal's past, why he is so crazy, like in the book.
B00005A1PR|5.0|This song writer has something that you don't see very often.  She has the ability to say what most women are thinking.  Her music touches the soul with its easy sound and honest lyrics.  She makes you want to sway with the beat, even if you can't dance.
B00000ILDE|5.0|The restored footage filled alot of plot holes that the original film left open. The scenes of the pre-alien attack colony, what happened to Ripley's daughter, and others. Plus the restored picture quality is great.<br />Millions of people watched this movie and are still in love with it (like me). It has everything: Action, Suspense, Drama, and the Aliens!
B00000ILDE|4.0|Although most would rate Ridley Scott's &quot;Alien&quot; - the first in the series, as the best, as far as excitement goes, this has got to be it. Be sure, this ain't no chick movie. It's for the guys. See the way the marines deploy, their firepower, the way they look - it's extreme. Keeps you on your toes. And the restored 17 minutes, which shows a little of what happened to the colonists and Ripley's daughter, helps to flesh out the movie more. Cameron was probably right to leave those bits out of the first screening as they were not as strong as the rest.
0780622553|4.0|I don't think anyone went to see this at the theatres, which is a shame. It is one of the most intelligent, engrossing Science Fiction films to come out in recent years. The film's visual style is stunning and the acting is first rate. The story, about a man searching for his lost identity who begins to unravel a conspiracy involving everyone in the city where he lives, is very well presented. I recommend this movie to anyone, not just Sci-Fi fans.
B00002Z88D|2.0|Mike Palm (Agent Orange) said it best: &quot;The public gets what they deserve not what they demand, unless we all decide to be a business not a band.&quot; Well what do you think happened with the boys in Metallica? Don't get me wrong, I'm not a bandwagon Metallibasher, although I do prefer the Cliff Burton era. I do like some of the new Metallica, so I gave this a fair shot. <br />First, I will give credit where it is due. Michael Camen did a great job here. Musically everyone played extremely well. Having said that, It isn't worth listening to. Remember, this is Heavy Metal music. I can understand adding an orchestra to Aerosmith or KISS, but not Metallica. It didn't compliment their style at all. I've seen Metallica in concert and know what kind of show they are capable of. Full of intensity, energy and raw power. That's what is missing here, Metallica's raw power. This is WAY too polished. <br />Trust me, there is plenty of good live Metallica material out there. All that I've heard is better than this, so at least listen to this before spending money on it. You might save yourself some cash.
0393312836|4.0|In a time when the literary world is becoming just as lazy as other branches of entertainment (film and music, for example), it's refreshing to be taken aback by a classic that stands convention on its head and disregards the rules of dull, refined storytelling.  This is what I experienced with &quot;A Clockwork Orange,&quot; which is part science-fiction, part comedy, and part social satire, and feels just as current (and relevant) today as it no doubt did during its initial publication (1963).  It's essentially the tale of a young hoodlum named Alex who robs, rapes, and murders without remorse, until imprisonment introduces him to a strange medical technique designed to turn criminals into 'normal' citizens.  The made-up slang writer Anthony Burgess uses here is very challenging (while you read, you pick up on certain words and are left to decipher the meanings) but ultimately may be too much for a casual reader; if you manage to make it past the first twenty pages, though, it's a safe bet you'll be set for the rest of the novel.  Issues of Free Will, social disorder, and childhood merging into adulthood are addressed without Bible-pounding preachiness, topics that can easily be related to our own chaotic modern society.<br />The much-ballyhooed final chapter, in which (SPOILER) Alex discovers that being a droog is a drag and adulthood is the next step in his life, struck me as syrupy--an ending that's been ripped off countless times since in film and books, among other places.  The whole 'recovery' at the end of chapter 6 was far more satisfying, with the threat of the patient out at work in the real world again, raping and robbing as he had before.<br />&quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; was also the basis for a 1971 film adaptation by Stanley Kubrick, and I must say--in comparison to the book--the language had been softened up to no doubt make it more accessible to the audience.  However, I believe both the novel and the film stand on their own as masterpieces of their respective medium.f their respective medium.
B00003CX6P|1.0|The Talented Mr. Ripley starts off with tremendous potential and quickly plumetts into the bowls of the movie world. It seemed as though the writers were simply making things up to ad on as the movie went along. Even more shameful than the desperate attempt at a plot or consistent story line, was the unusually poor acting performances of Mr. Damon and Ms. Paltrow. The only redeaming feature of the movie is the wonderful performance of Jude Law, without which I would have vomitted on myself several time from the sheer pain of watching this film. Watch this movie ONLY if you wish to feel as though you were just robbed of a small piece of your life!
B00003CXN4|5.0|Steven Soderbergh is a sensational director and showed his ability in creating this great movie. I personally believe that Traffic deserved to win Best Picture over Gladiator. This movie has a great cast of actors (personally my favorite Benicio Del Toro), and the great cast is just a little special feature as what this movie has to offer on the war on drugs in America today. I just love the message it sends out about our U.S government..This is a must-own dvd for your collection.
B0000025CP|5.0|This is my all-time favorite Priest album and what I consider to be the best metal album ever made.  Any true metal fan has to own this incredible album.  All songs are awesome and there isn't any filler.  Rob Halford's vocal work is just incredible.  Excellent album all the way through.  A must have.
0064407667|1.0|Rarely was a book so aptly named:  This one is indeed a Bad Beginning to a series.  It's clear that writers like JK Rowlings (of Harry Potter fame), Patricia Wrede (the Dealing with Dragons series) and EL Konigsberg (oh so many wonderful books) -- to name just a few, like and respect their readers, even the young ones.  Lemony Snicket, in contrast, is snide and condescending.  I can't imagine reading any of the other books this author is pumping out.  Two thumbs down!
B00004Z4WQ|2.0|One would know the plot of Scary Movie if he/she has seen Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer, but this is not why I consider the movie ridiculous.<br />The movie starts out funny in the beginning, but as one gets to the middle, it gets stupider by the minute. To add another comment, the end of the movie made absolutely no sense.<br />After finishing my viewing of the movie, I checked out some deleted scenes, which were also stupid except for one. The one deleted scene that even came close to funny involved sex...between Wayans' character and a female. One would have to view the scene to know why it's the funniest one.<br />In conclusion, despite the few funny scenes in the movie, it is not worth buying. A lot of money would be saved just renting it if one even bothers to view it at all.
B00003CXSP|2.0|Jeesh, this is the first movie I have ever seen where someone in the theater threw up due to the content of the movie.  In fact, I am still astonished that movies with content like this are given an R rating, while movies with excessive naughty language or exposed genitals get the NC-17 or X shaft.<br />Regardless of content, this movie was pretty flat.  Sir Anthony Hopkins was good as usual, and I thought Julianne Moore did a pretty good job as well, but the script and direction were very much lacking in brains.<br />Ridley Scott's directing is very high in style, but has little substance.  He fills the screen with slick shots and edits, but they do not bring any deeper meaning to the film.  He also leaves nothing unsaid, never letting the audience figure out anything on their own.<br />One example illustrates how much better of a movie Jonathan Demme made in Silence of the Lambs.  Both films explored the aspect of women in a mostly male occupation (FBI agent), and the difficulties that come with it.  Silence of the Lambs portrayed this with subtle eye movements and stares from men over Clarice Starling's body.  Hannibal does it with Ray Liotta screaming, &quot;country pussy&quot; over and over again.<br />Character development is handled the same way.  The script throws Mason Verger's early fancy for young boys right out at our first proper introduction to him, seemingly so we can start hating him at that point.<br />The story puzzled me as well.  They set up Lecter as a brilliant man, foiling any plot to recapture him with violently clever retribution, only to have him fall into an obvious and foolish trap.<br />This movie lacks the suspense of Silence, and its only fallback seems to be gory violence.  Every death seems to get grizzlier, with blood and guts filling the screen.  If you are looking for a thriller, this isn't it.  If you are looking for a mindless slasher, this is your movie.
B000002UA0|1.0|Why Does Amazon Rate This Floyd Album As Essential? Piper At The Gates And Saucerful Are Worth A Listen Or Two To Hear The Bands Roots, But Thats Where It Ends. Guess It's O.K. With A Hell Of A Buzz, But Not In Any Other State Of Mind.
B00005J73X|5.0|Truth be told, there are a few songs (&quot;Always,&quot; &quot;Blaze of Glory,&quot; &quot;Bed of Roses&quot; and a few others) that are NOT featured on this album and should be. That said, these 15 tracks are brilliant and stand alone just fine. They cover a wide enough range so that the newly-initiated feels at home (&quot;It's My Life,&quot; &quot;Just Older,&quot; &quot;One Wild Night&quot;) without abandoning the hard-core follower (&quot;Livin on a Prayer,&quot; &quot;Something for the Pain,&quot; &quot;Runaway,&quot; a great rendition of &quot;You Give Love a Bad Name,&quot; etc). 15 tracks of live, Jersey-style rock.... How can you possibly turn this one down? It makes for great listening over and over again and leaves you with the magical experience that can otherwise only be felt live in concert...and since the tour just concluded with a great show in Giants Stadium, NJ, you must check this one out.
B00005ASQ1|4.0|Finding Forrester is a complex, quiet gem that left me totally satisfied. No stereotypes. The characters were well drawn and totall believable, even F. Murray Abraham's &quot;Salieri&quot;-like character.Rob Brown as Jamal was believable. He was an active listener,(a lesson for many experienced actors). Sean Connery's Forrester was intense and vulnerable at the same time. This is a thoughtful film about friendship in its many forms. I would have given it 5 stars, but for the sound. Some parts were just very hard to hear. Thank goodness for rewind/replay. If you want a film and characters that you can remember long after the credits, this film is for you.
B00003CX5P|2.0|But now it means nothing to us.  The movie wasn't great, and when it was first released, we were ticked for it not having a DVD release.  Now that that 'phase' is over, a DVD is released.  I know I don't want it anymore.<br />The movie has already been played on TV.  Why waste the money?
B00003CXRM|5.0|This movie is great and the extra features on the DVD are well-worth it. There is a special feature on how they did the colouring with before and after clips. Also the music video for \\"Man of constant sorrow\\" is included which is fabulous.    After I rented the DVD and watched it, I had to buy it that same day. Never felt that way about a movie before. I couldn't recommend it more highly. The story is great, the cinematography is incredible and the music is wonderful. Enjoy!
0929071697|5.0|This book shows you the life of mafia  from the side, which you never knew about, unless you are a member of it.

B00005ABX0|4.0|OK, so Smile was supposed to be the Rosetta Stone, The Golden Fleece, the Holy Grail. Get over it...We all know the sordid tales of substance abuse and manic depresssion that nearly distroyed Brian. And with his self distruction, so too were the Smile sessions obliterated. Well it's been more than thirty years and endless speculation over what Smile may have been. Never the less, Smiley Smile, which followed on the heels of Pet Sounds was as Carl Wilson so aptly put it, &quot;more of bunt than a grand slam&quot;. So the world, myself included, was under-whelmed by Smiley Smile. But, the years have been kind and Smiley Smile stands on it's own as one of the Beach Boys more satisfying efforts. Not only did they score two top-40 hits with Good Vibrations and Heroes &amp; Vilains, but Vegatables, Wind Chimes and With Me Tonight all qualify as minor masterpieces.<br />Wild Honey released in 1967 was a real departure for the BB. Not only was Brian's hand at production down-played to the extent where he really takes a back seat to brother Carl and cousin Mike, but the biggest change was the R&amp;B influence. Here the boys jump into Stevie Wonder's I Was Made To Love Her with blue-eyed soulful abandoment. While it's true most of the BB albums of this period are spotty and somewhat uneven, Wild Honey holds together rather well. In fact I do believe the bulk of these two albums sound a whole lot less dated than much of what was permeating the air-waves at that time. Do I dare say &quot;Along Comes Mary&quot;, It's A Sign Of The Times&quot;, I've Got A Brand New Set Of Roller Skates&quot;....I could go on and on.

B00003CXRM|5.0|Being a fan of Fargo and Big L., I went on a recommendation from my brother to rent this movie.  I had no idea what it was about.  I rented it on Friday, watched it all the way through and then went back several times to my favorite scenes (Thank goodness for DVD!).  I sadly had to return it on Saturday.  I rented it again on Sunday and took it (regretfully) back this morning.  <br />I am not sure if it is the story, the music, or George Clooney's &quot;watchability&quot;, but I am hooked on this movie.  I had never seen George Clooney before, and I realize that I have been deprived.  What a cutie!<br />However, the story is fabulous, the lines are funny and the music is great.  I am generally a rock fan, but enjoy many kinds of music.  My favorite song was either Down to the River to Pray or Man of Constant Sorrow.  The scenes and the songs were absolutely beautiful.  I also like the siren's song.<br />I will probably have to buy the DVD and the soundtrack.

B00003CXSP|2.0|Should have been good with the direction from Ridley Scott and the reprisal of Anthony Hopkins as the title character... yet it wasn't.  Even with all the trick camera shots, it wasn't visually entertaining, intelligent, worth the ticket price.  And these reviews I see others have written, everyone thinks the book ending would have been better but the company (MGM) spent much money and ended up with three different endings, one from the book, one partially adapted from the book, and the one in the movie.  David Mamet's only task on the writing was to re-write the ending, and that is just such an incredible waste of his talents.  It's good to see Demme and Tally have morals and quality, but it shamed me to hear that Foster only turned down the part because she couldn't get the money she wanted.  Now that's more horrible than Lecter.  Might be worth a RENT if you are able to find the dvd with all the features, but all in all no special features would redeem you for paying twenty dollars for this dribble, it is a bloody, violent, at times boring, waste of celluloid... but hey, most people just go for blood these days.
6305181772|5.0|This is an amazing movie and should be seen by all viewers and not just ardent spy fans. Tom Cruise is fantastic as special agent Eathan Hunt, Jon Voight great as his boss and that famous computer scene is worth buying the movie for.
0618135871|2.0|When you love a book, as I did &quot;Portnoy's Complaint&quot; and &quot;The Ghost Writer&quot; even more than Roth's later books, though I felt keenly attuned to &quot;The Counterlife&quot; too, you Remember the scenes vividly even if, as I am, you are aging and tend to be forgetful. Now, I read &quot;The Dying Animal&quot; only two months ago, not 25+ years ago, and I remember breasts, the cancer, the man's consciousness, but vaguely as lesser books are forgettable or become vague. Just writing this helps me clarify how to tell if you love a book and if you find it worthy: how much and how well can you conjure back, vividly. Here, not much. But with Roth, one has a large selection from which to choose. I'm a Rothophile, and do not expect genius each time out.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|What a great car CD. I love it. I just wish they had added &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; to the CD. Ewan McGregor knows how to sell a song and there are 2 amazing tenors on a few of the tracks. Alessandro Safina sings on the &quot;Elephant Love Medley&quot; and his voice just vibrates through you (as the moon). If you liked the movie you'll want the soundtrack.
B00003CXE7|5.0|I think some of you missed the whole &quot;entertainment&quot; value of this movie. I think some people put way too much emphasis on historical value to this movie. When I went to see this movie, I went to see a movie about a &quot;gladiator&quot;, hence the movie title &quot;Gladiator&quot;. Hmm, no brainer. I wasn't expecting to see a movie about historical Rome (thankfully), otherwise the movie would of been called...hmm, maybe &quot;Rome&quot;? Also, I never saw &quot;Based on true events&quot; anywhere, or &quot;...the most historically accurate movie about Rome&quot; or &quot;..gladiators&quot;, so I never expected these things. I loved the story, and the action scenes. I loved the entertainment value of it being a movie, not a documentary. So for all the reviewers who bashed the ones who enjoyed the movie by calling them &quot;moronic&quot;, who's the moronic ones? The ones who went out to watch a movie about a &quot;Gladiator&quot; and got their money's worth out of it, or the ones who paid to watch a movie about a &quot;Gladiator&quot; thinking they were getting a documentary on Rome?
B00005AACC|3.0|I was surprised to discover that this is a refashioning of Hitchcock's 1946 classic &quot;Notorious.&quot;  While Cruise and Newton are no Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman, they don't try to be.  Refreshingly, the film only borrows the shell of the story, without trying to be some kind of remake.<br />Thandie Newton is, in particular, a pleasure in this film.  Not only does she have truckloads of screen presence, is strikingly beautiful (I can't stop watching her when she's onscreen), and can actually act, she has been given an actual flesh and blood, thinking, real character to portray ... not just &quot;the woman.&quot;  <br />I was disappointed in one scene, though, where she - an obviously skilled pickpocket - makes the grevious error of replacing an item into the wrong pocket from which she'd originally picked it, which reveals herself to the villain. <br />However, later, she regains this ground when she injects herself with the virus, turning herself from a somewhat disposable character into suddenly the most valuable person in the room.<br />But what I like most about this film is something I like about other Woo films I've seen (Face/Off).  He takes characters who symbolically represent figures from ancient mythology and puts them into an arena to fight it out.  This film tells you in the first sentence what the story is really about:  &quot;When you set out to create a hero, you must first create something that all heroes require:  a villain.&quot;<br />We return to this theme at the very end during the motorcycle chase.  When the two men fly off of those cycles and slam into each other, we finally have our hero and our villain, our virus and antivirus, engaged in mortal combat - each as brutal, each as determined, each as clever.<br />Wordlessly pounding each other on that surf-battered shore, in truly operatic fashion, the film elevates from a mere action movie to the level of mythology, and to one myth in particular:  the desperate battle between good andevil.<br />Woo realizes this myth on the screen in true, splashy, Saturday matinee fashion, and - on that level - it is quite a pleasure to watch!
B00004Z4WR|4.0|ok, first i wanna say that this is a really good movie, but maybe it is more a movie for the male-viewers. the plot is very simple, but there are a lot of neat cars and sexy women, especially angelina jolie. also the ideas of how they steal the cars and how they prepare themselves is done pretty good. furthermore nicolas cage did again a really good job. anyway this is a decent movie, but if you like fast cars it is defenitely worth watching it.
0671449028|4.0|Bright colors and funny animals make this board book appealing for pre-schoolers.  The thick pages were easy to grip and durable enough to withstand my son's rough handling.  I look forward to getting more books Boynton.
B0000025CP|5.0|When I first heard &quot;Stained Class&quot; I was blown away.  This is perhaps one of the most complete records I have ever heard.  I mean, it has every thing you would look for in a classic heavy metal record. The band's musicianship is excellent and so is the songwirting.  Great, well-wrought lyrics.  And the production job is crystal clear.  Buy this classic and you will NOT regret it!
B000002HB4|4.0|This is pretty strong guitar rock. Dan Baird writes clever lyrics. Their cover of &quot;Almost Saturday Night&quot; is much better than Fogerty's original. &quot;Another Chance&quot;, &quot;Six Years Gone&quot;, &quot;Mon Cheri&quot;, &quot;Down and Down&quot;, &quot;Dan Takes Five&quot;, &quot;Keep Your Hands to Yourself&quot; are all terrific songs. &quot;Saddle Up&quot; is the highlight for me - a straight-ahead 3-chord song, but done at completely full tilt.

B000021XR5|3.0|After I bought this CD, I was quite disappointed. Not really by the songs themselves, because some of them were pretty good, Sour Girl and Down the true gems, but mostly because I knew that STP could do better. Take a look at Purple, for instance. There are so many great songs on that CD, certainly bringing out some of STP's best work. But still, I cannot say that this album is any better than their previous album, Songs From A Vatican Giftshop, in which some of the songs just were not good at all. Hopefully STP's newest album is better, because it would be truly disappointing if they offered another dismal album like this.
B00005JA2B|5.0|After 25 years, this album is now finally available in a format that does justice to the music it contains. The punch, depth, and clarity are breathtaking. If you do a side by side listening comparison between this album and the original CD pressing, particularly with a pair of good headphones, I guarantee you'll be amazed. For the first time you can actually hear a deep soundstage, with some instruments leaping out at you and others retreating into the background, literally producing a third dimension (back to front) that was never there before. You'll hear acoustic guitar licks and backing vocals that had been buried alive for 25 years. The famous instrumental counterpoint section in &quot;Miracles Out Of Nowhere&quot; is now a real tour de force- you can cleanly pick out every note of each instrument. One nice thing is that if you make personal mixes of Kansas tunes to play in your car, personal stereo, etc., you no longer have to play with your volume control as you go from old Kansas tunes to more recent ones. This remastering has boosted the signal quite a bit &amp; made it as hot as Kansas recordings from the 1990's.<br />As if the sound weren't enough (and it is), here's a re-release which contains VERY intelligently and coherently written liner notes (a rarity in the rock world) that are very sympathetic towards Kansas (also a journalistic rarity), by a fellow from Rolling Stone, never a magazine known for its great love of this band and its brethren. Well done. There are also two interesting live bonus tracks, but they are just the bow on the box - well worth purchasing even without them.<br />I have nothing negative to say about this re-release. I very rarely give five stars to anything but it deserves no less. This album is an object lesson in how to remaster old analog recordings and make them come alive, along with a package that is expertly and tastefully assembled. This is a magnificent production worthy of this wonderful album's 25th anniversary. Kansas should be very proud, and they should breath a collective sigh of relief that Sony has at last done right by them.<br />Note: all of the above comments apply equally to the new digital remastering of MASQUE, the album Kansas released in 1975 prior to LEFTOVERTURE. Buying both of these is highly recommended.nsas should be very proud, and they should breath a collective sigh of relief that Sony has at last done right by them.<br />Note: all of the above comments apply equally to the new digital remastering of MASQUE, the album Kansas released in 1975 prior to LEFTOVERTURE.

B00004Z459|5.0|Wow, what can i say? This CD is definetly worth buying. I don't usually even like this type of music, a mix of heavy metal style guitars and lots of rap style vocals. Alternative is what I prefer, but after hearing the song Crawling, I decided to check this CD out. And sure enough, I liked what i heard. While this does not mean I am a fan of all music of this type, this album is certainly an exception. Immediately upon listening through the album once, I was instantly hooked to songs such as Papercut, One Step Closer, Pushing Me Away, and In The End, although I would have to say In The End is my favorite. I also like the sort of techno style they combine with their music, especially evident on the song Cure For The Itch. Fans of any style of alternative should probably check this CD out, and, of course, fans of this type of music should definetly buy this album. It is a worthwhile addition to anyone's CD collection.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|In many ways, this is a very brave and radical film in its presentation and exploration of overt spiritual concepts in a mainstream film. Of course, these are expertly tucked inside the folds of an Orpheus-like tragedy, and I don't recall being so emotionally moved by something since Krysztof's Keislowski's &quot;Red&quot; back in 1994. I mean, how can you go wrong with a film that has an earthbound siren trapped in a marvellous space-and-time &quot;show&quot; run by a morally compromised Master of Illusion, Zidler, as she - the 'Material Girl' in a Material World -  stands on her roof after confronting the tension of Christian's love on the one hand and Zidler inculcating her over and over with the need to prostitute herself, while singing &quot;One day I'll fly away/ leave this all to Yesterday/What good is going from dream to dream/and dreading the day/when dreaming ends?&quot; I mean, Wow. Whoever expected Sri Nisardgatta, Auribindo, AND Jesus in such a brief, unassuming pop song?  <br />As for the rest, well, as a disc, I could have lived without FatBoy Slim's mechanical thunder, but it plays well enough. I avoid the radio, so &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; sounds (kind of ) new to me, still. Ewan McGregor has a distinctive voice, and his phrasing and emotion on Elton John's &quot;Your Song&quot; and &quot;Elephant Love Medley&quot; accomplish something very unusual. He and Baz Luhman have taken pop songs that seemed rather trivial and dressed for teen love or gross commercial exploitation upon their original incarnations (&quot;Don't Leave Me This Way&quot;, &quot;Silly Love Songs&quot;and &quot;Up Where We Belong&quot;) and brought them up to a newl level of transcendent meaning, at least for those with eyes to see and ears to hear. On film and disc, David Bowie's &quot;Heroes&quot; is a great moment, even as far divorced from its crafty Brian Eno origins as it sounds. <br />Nicole's voice may not be wholly trained, but her delivery on &quot;One Day I'll Fly Away&quot; is darn breathtaking, especially as it is augmented by an orchesral arrangement that sounds like film composer Pino Donaggio(&quot;Dressed to Kill&quot;, &quot;Blow Out&quot;) steering a gondola down the Grand Canal during a sunset seeping into eternity. This one is grand and totally over the top. Anyone who loved those swelling Italian-AMerican pop song arrangements from the early 60s will play it probably a couple of hundred times.<br />&quot;Hindi Sad Chant&quot; accompanies the film's mind-blowing finale in the Moulin Rouge set(which I wish we could have seen more of, Baz!)that has  been made up to look like the Indian 'Bollywood' Musical of all Musicals, and resembles nothing so much as staring into the smile of Krishna at the moment of Illumination. 'Chamma, Chamma' is interpolated along with Nicole's finale concession to Zidler's corporate mentality and 'the lure of diamonds'. John Leguiziamo gets to play the Sitar and proclaims &quot;I Only Speak the Truth...&quot;. It's a wild cut, and has great impact once you have seen the film.<br />I subtract one star simply because we deserve a second CD of ALL the  music from &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot;: John Broadbent's wacko version of  Madonna's &quot;Like A Virgin&quot;, &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot;, &quot;Spectacular, Spectacular&quot; etc, etc.  I understand the producers' vision in delivering a &quot;commercial&quot; product,and one cannot fault them their omissions for having already delivered a film and CD that rises SO FAR above the cynical, empty, nihilistic, and essentially pornographic junk masquerading as film and music that still seems to dominate current pop culture.
B00003CXP1|5.0|I have read the majority of the reviews posted and to be honest, they are all right. The majority of the responses have been that this film is great. I have never done heroin or anything of the sort, but after watching this film I am completely reassured that I would never try it, even if my life depended on it. The main point that I take from a film is how destructive drugs and addiction period has on people. I don't care how often you see a crack addict or know of friend who does drugs, this film takes you on that emotional and mental journey that many of us have never traveled. Quite honestly I had no intent on watching this film , but hearing about the power that this film it intrigued me. I am parent and I pretty sure the question of drugs will be heard at some point in life, at that time if my children are of age, I am pretty sure that I will show this film to them. Maybe these distributing images will shine clearer than those images of total bliss associated with drug use. To get back to the film the acting was great. Ellen Brystn did an excellent job and to be honest as was stated in previous reviews, she was snubbed. She was declining so fast that if you get caught up in the other characters (as I did) you do not notice her fast descent. I felt the most pity for Jennifer Connelly. It seems that every woman with a drug addiction sucumbs to the behavior that she eventually begin to manifest. I just kept reflecting back to her character in the begin of the film and how different she became. The climax is definitely heart racing and those images are burned into your conscience. I could go on and on, but this film is definitely worth purchase or viewing period. But for me the story was just to much for my mind.
0790729628|1.0|Warner Bros.! Please release Bladerunner in 5.1 Dolby and 2.0 Dolby surround. what's the point of making a DVD if it's not going to have the quality of a DVD? That's the whole reason in buying them.
B00003CXC7|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock's \\"Rear Window\\" is my favourite movie of all time, so I was thrilled to find that Universal were releasing it as one of their magnificent Collector's Edititon. Let there be no doubt about the cinematic qualities of this feature, this movie is what it is all about! If you must buy one DVD this year, let it be this one. It doesn't get any better than this. Having said that, I would like to comment on the technical quality of this \\"Collector's Edition.\\" This is the one negative aspect that I could find. The extra material is very good, however, taking into consideration the many difficulties  that the restoration team encountered while trying to save this movie, I (for one, at least) would have liked to see more about how it was actually restored. And why wasn't the 2000 re-release trailer included, when you can find it on the Internet? Also, I miss a separate audio track with  commentaries from the cast and crew, not to mention the restoration team, led by James C. Katz and Robert A. Harris.  And finally, and this is single most important issue in connection with this release, why did they make such a lousy transfer of the movie itself? It looks like it was made in ten minutes or something. Maybe a new THX certified transfer would be preferable for subsequent releases of this movie, i.e. on the second edition of this DVD. In my opinion the \\"Vertigo\\" Laserdisc edition looked sharper and had less noise than this DVD version of \\"Rear Window.\\" And I think that they did a wonderful job with the &quot;Vertigo&quot; DVD transfer, so I don't understand why this one needs to look so second-rate. Really, this doesn't change anything, though, you should still buy at least three copies of this movie! They don't make movies like this anymore.
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park's &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; is probably the best record I've heard in the past 2 years. This cd is outstanding. I cannot say enough good things about it. The arrangement of this cd is off the hook and the layout and overall feel of it is damn near perfect. These guys are very very talented and will go very far. <br />Perfectly blends rock and rap and makes it look easy. The singer's voice is &quot;amazing&quot; and the raps are fantastic. The best track by far is #8 which is probably in my top 10 of the best songs I have ever heard in my life. Buy this record. 6 stars.
B00005B36H|5.0|Reading through the reviews of this album I was surprised at how many people don't fully appreciate it.  Each time TOOL comes out with new music, it is more complex, and more musically impressive than the last.  It was very true from Opiate to Undertow, then to AEnima, and now to Lateralus.  The depth of some of the songs just boggles the mind.  The use of syncopation, (even within drums beats themselves... how can the srummer play two beats at once??) the way the lyrics fit over the music, the way one song flows into the next... I just can't understand how they manage to do it so well.  Every single track is amazing (although my least favorite track is &quot;Schism&quot;), and every track is there for a reason.  Yes, it may have the same general sound as previous TOOL work, and yes the songs are long (which I, personally, love) but it's just amazing.  If you don't have it yet, buy it now, and if you do have it, listen to it again and again and again.  This is what rock should be!!
0783110928|5.0|Gia is a very powerful and intense movie. Angelina Jolie plays the part of Gia very well, she rocks!
B0000028RR|5.0|As I had just described, no hard rock record I own is at the intensity level of Rage´s debut.  I couldn´t believe it when I first heard it.<br />Sparked by the Matrix theme ¨Wake Up¨ and nothing more, I decided to buy this CD.  Never did I imagine to find a full album with the same amount of energy and thought put into them.  <br />Zack de la Rocha´s furious lyrics tell stories of political controversy, anger, racial discrimination, and sympathy for the oppressed.  <br />Tom Morello´s guitar is insindiary, and he displays his most varied guitar work to date.  Solos that soar from the blindingly fast (¨Take the Power Back¨,¨Know your Enemy¨, ¨Township Rebellion¨), unique (¨Bullet in the Head¨, ¨Fistfull of Steel¨, ¨Wake Up¨), and the expressive (¨Settle for Nothing¨, ¨Freedom¨).  Unpredictable and well planned, Morello proves his hours of practice in his Harvard dorm room have done him well. He is truly one of today´s most ´revolutionary´ guitarists, (no pun intended).  <br />Timmy C shows great and hard to find skill on the bass, pounding out funky rhythms on ¨Take the Power Back¨ and ¨Know your Enemy¨´s intro.  He takes the bass driven ¨Bullet in the Head¨ to the next level, showing his great sense for a down played but crucial instrument.<br />Brad Wilk, though not often mentioned, provides Rage´s mandatory beat.  With the variety of funky, punk, and oddly coordinated bass drum beats under his belt, he sets the tone for Rage to take off and explode.<br />Though probably not the heaviest record recorded, it is high on that scale.  With an equally heavy background, de la Rocha lets his lyrics loose, with euphimisms that make you think, and screams that ventilates his fury.  ¨Killing in the Name¨, ¨Bullet in the Head¨, and ¨Freedom¨ are de la Rocha vehicles that express anger and years of suffering in the form of intelligent and well crafted songs.  Each song blends angry lyrics, driving guitar riffs and sounds that inspire every guitarist (including myself), thumping bass, and pulsating rhythms itno 10 rentless works of art on one album that never even for a second loses speed.<br />Though the three albums that followed all had power, and incredibly well crafted songs, none of these three will ever match the awesome energy of the original debut ´Rage Against the Machine´.  I recommend this album to any hard rock fan.  Buy It!
B0000542DJ|5.0|The movie JFK has an un-relenting belief that the answer goes all the way up to the top, that takes gumpshion. You root for Costner from beginning to end, not because he know's who killed Kennedy, but because of the deep conviction and Gut-Feeling that he think's he know's who killed President Kennedy. That is what the history has become. Not in the books, but in our theories. Mostly fueled by the thing's we cannot see, our fear's about Kennedy's death drove into the creation process of JFK the film. It is First important that you know the fact's about what was assumed to have happened before you allow a hundred different idea's change that view. JFK is great at delivering awesome performances (such as a very long and heated court scene with Costner) and showing a paranoid nation that now remembers exactly what they where doing when John F. Kennedy was killed.
B00003CXRM|5.0|This is by far one of the most unappreciated movies of all time. I had to wait to rent it and I regret having not seen it in the theaters. I would reccomend this movie to anyone who appreciates the less complicated things in life. Oh, make sure you check out the soundtrack too! Also a 5-star.
078322799X|4.0|Right off the bat in frightners you know you are in for a good ride. It starts with a wall-and-carpet surfing phantom chasing a young girl through a &quot;bates motel&quot; like house. The segment, one of many, leaves you on the edge, whether or not she get's it.<br /> Frighteners has something to offer that is definately unique: A funny rip roar into the horror and thriller world. I will go ahead a get the bad stuff out of the way. First off, in the tv preview, there is a scene that makes the hint that we are going to see Micheal and the ghost's meet the first time. Well, this scene...the one that looked the coolest (him sitting in a chair while the ghost's taunt him)...wasn't in the film.<br /> Eh, buzzer.<br /> Second off, why in the heck was this movie &quot;R&quot;? Not since last of the mohicans has a movie been so openly plastered with the wrong rating (Look at mars Attacks, for instance)! But it is still not appropriate for some.<br /> Thirdly, the cowboy ghost. He had no purpose, and yes he was funny at times, but the poor bone dropping roper could have been left out. (The jumping into the casket and rollicking with the dead corpse scene should have been left out! Tacky!) Now, the good stuff. This is for Tim Burton buffs. Even though he didn't direct it, you still get that Burton feeling. Micheal J. Fox rocks, of course, as an expert on the paranormal.<br /> There is a character in this movie so befitting Jim Carey, that I wonder why they couldn't fork out a few more bucks and get him to do it. The character is a nervous and wacky investigator that lightens up the mood (exactly opposite - but just as well as Fox.) This is a definate 4 out of 5 star movie, and could have been a little better, but heck no movie is perfect. Frighters all in all, is a re-watcher!
B000001U3K|5.0|I bought this album on the recommendation of a couple of my Lou Reed-fan friends, and now I believe that I'm a convert. I've heard Walk on the Wildside and Perfect Day before, and always loved them both. Perfect Day's contrasting lyrics and musical sound are fabulous. Walk on the Wildside is just one of those songs that you always hear on a classic rock station. It's a classic!  The use of piano and keyboards throughout the whole album is really well orchestrated. It's rare to hear such wonderful use of piano in rock n'roll. If you're into that kind of sound, check out Perfect Day and Sattelite of Love. I was far from surprised to see that David Bowie is in the credits for production, song arrangements, and backing vocals. There is definitely Bowie-influence, particularly on Sattelite of Love and Wagon Wheel. The mixture of Lou Reed's distinctive vocals and lyrics with the Bowie sound is just enchanting. If you are into an eccentric, eclectic kind of rock n'roll, this is the album for you.  If you're just starting to get into Lou Reed, this is also the album for you. I've owned this album for about a week and I'm already clicking through reviews of other Reed albums, desperately trying to plan my next musical purchase.
B00005B4GU|5.0|...In their 5th studio album, &quot;Amnesiac&quot;. Some other reviewers have called it &quot;leftovers from 'Kid A'. (Their 4th album, recorded at the same time. I disagree strongly - I thought this one was just as good, if not better than Kid A. It isn't a &quot;Kid B&quot;, either - the songs get deeper and more complex in this album. It starts off with the electronic &quot;Packt like sardines in a crushd tin box&quot;, which brings Autechre and Aphex Twin-like sounds to the plate. &quot;Idioteque&quot; on &quot;Kid A&quot; is very similar to this one. Next it moves on to the beautiful piano track &quot;Pyramid Song&quot;, and the dirty beat-laden &quot;Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors&quot; which features Thom Yorke's altered voice to a mixture of dance (if you want to call it that) beats. Both of these have the same whistling, almost screechy sound at the end. &quot;You and Whose Army?&quot; is the first song with any hint of a guitar, and it starts as a slow taunt - then picks up. This is followed by &quot;I might be wrong&quot;, which features a very catchy and funky guitar riff over a perfect drum beat. Next on the dinner table is &quot;Knives Out&quot;, a song which hints at cannibalism. Don't worry, it is one of the better tracks. &quot;Morning Bell/Amnesiac&quot; is a slower version of Kid A's &quot;Morning Bell&quot;. &quot;Dollars &amp; Cents&quot; is a simply amazing song. &quot;Hunting Bears&quot; is a bunch of guitarry goodness. &quot;Like Spinning Plates&quot; is the most bizarre track on the album, with Yorke's backwards voice over a swishy sound - It's like spinning plates indeed. Last is the jazzy death march &quot;Life in a Glasshouse&quot;, with roaring trumpet solos. Track by track review you say? Oh, you're a naughty one:<br />Packt like sardines in a crushd tin box - Very catchy, and therefore very good. This one gets an A.<br />Pyramid Song - The most beautiful track on the album, but not the best. This gets an A, also.<br />Pull/Pulk Revolving Doors - The dirty beat throws off a lot of people, but I do like it. This gets a B+.<br />You and whose army? - Seems a little too slow, but improves just enough. This one gets an A-.<br />I might be wrong - Now, we could go for this! Gets an A+ in my book.<br />Knives Out - Sounds a lot like &quot;Paranoid Android&quot;, but who am I to complain? An A for you, sir.<br />Morning Bell/Amnesiac - I didn't like this too much. C+<br />Dollars and Cents - Very cool. It gets a very cool rating too - An A+.<br />Hunting Bears - Not the worst track (I do not prefer Morning Bell/Amnesiac to this one), but it's just an instrumental, and nothing special. B-<br />Like Spinning Plates - VERY musical, VERY good. A+<br />Life in a Glasshouse - The jazzers wail in this one, amongst Yorke's wailing. It's great. A+<br />So, I enjoyed this album save for a few tracks. It's still a good Radiohead album, and I reccomend that you give it a try.
B00005B36H|4.0|This will be looked back on as one of the year's best albums. Mature, refined, and expertly crafted, Lateralus is Tool's finest effort yet. The songs are all good, and there are no weakpoints. With the help of segues and instrumental stopgaps, it all flows well together and works as an album. Here we get Tool's usual angst-driven, \\"think for yourself\\" lyrics, but this time they are more refined. Singer Maynard James Keenan also delivers them more deliberately, with less emphasis on pure screaming (though there is certainly plenty of that), including some in fact some beautiful bits of singing. Guitarist Adam Jones and bassist Justin Chancellor drive the music with pounding riffs and subtle strumming; Tool is a truly locked in, tight band. This is an album for the metal or perhaps heavy alt-rock fan looking for a little bit more. It is also perhaps for the prog rock fan  looking for some talent in the newer generation. Lateralus is not exactly an easy listen; it's a long and winding album requiring a bit of effort. However, it is highly recommended -- a contender for Album of The Year.
B000003TA4|5.0|Nirvana's second album, Nevermind, has been the defining moment for the grunge movement.  Kurt Cobain shares his views of angst and frustration, while the other band members provide a heavy background for his message.  It's not a happy message, but I feel that many listeners will be able to relate to it.  If you want an album that addresses relevant issues, along with a hard-rockin' backdrop, this is the album for you.
B00005B36H|5.0|In the last four years I have been searching for a masterpiece that AEnima became with a great album from beginning to end and I believe that I have found that in Lateralus. Lots of the reviews that I have read about this album have been very negative but I dont know how anyone could rate this album as being a disappointment. Granted its not as pop happy as Undertow and maybe not as demonic as AEnima. Yet this album had something even more special about it and after listening to it about 4 or 5 times i found that this album was more than great rock but also it is like a fine painting. Done to perfection with a strong message and just great artwork in vocals, guitar riffs, bass and the drumming is the best I have ever heard in any other album i have ever heard before. This is a must have for ANY rock fan and if you are a Tool fan and don't already own this album...shame on you.
B000002KKD|5.0|The B-52's self titled album is a mixture of both surf-rock and new wave-rock.  Most of the songs are fairly basic, but the B-52's are able to take full advantage of simplicity.  The lyrics are very original, and the songs have an upbeat feel.  I'd have to say that this is one of my favorite CD's, and it's a top priority when I'm throwing a party.
0385501560|4.0|This book follows Chuck Palahniuk's style very much.  It is entertaining, yet I think the story gets lost at times with all the underlining messages.  All things seem to reflect our society as in his other books.  It still is good and woth a read.
6305841861|5.0|Quite possibly the best horror movie ever made!<br />Most modern horror movies just throw gore at you to get you to respond. But this movie works on so many levels.<br />A definate 10 on the gross out meter.<br />A definate 10 on the laugh meter.<br />A definate 10 on the spooky meter.<br />Completely original, the Evil Dead series have a certain 'feel' to them, (for lack of a better word).<br />I had a 17 year-old girl come up to me a couple of weeks ago and said that she saw the scariest movie in the world and she just loved it.<br />She said that movie was Evil Dead.<br />I told her that I thought Evil Dead 2 was the best of the 3, but that Army of Darkness, (the 3rd in the trilogy), was pretty good too.<br />She flipped out and begged me to let her borrow my Evil Dead 2 Special Edition.<br />I let her use it upon the condition that she watched it with a bunch of her friends.<br />As far as the DVD version goes...everything on this disk is worth checking out.<br />The BEST part of the disk?<br />The audio commentary with Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell.<br />Still the best I've ever heard on a DVD.<br />If you like Evil Dead 2...this will quickly become one of your favorite DVDs that you will watch over and over again.<br />If you've never seen any of the Evil Dead movies...rent all 3 and watch them in sequence.<br />Otherwise, watch Evil Dead 2 by itself, and you'll definately want to check out the others :)<br />P.S. I have 2 versions...this version and the Tin boxed set which will remain sealed. One to watch and one to collect :)
B00004YKUX|5.0|Wow. I can't take it out of the player. Something about Johnny's old and haggard, but rich and cavernous voice, his restraint, and the way his soul is bared in front of you as he sings. Whether it's his own song or someone else's doesn't matter a jot, by the time he's finished the song is so deeply embedded in your soul it's yours too. &quot;One&quot; truly made me cry, proper tears and all, and I could never say that for the original U2 version.<br />This guy is irreplaceable. I discovered Johnny Cash properly (I mean, is there anybody in the western world who hasn't actually heard of him!?) when I by chance came across him and Willie Nelson performing on TV in VH1 Storytellers. Something about them both stopped me in my tracks and held me spellbound, and I haven't got either out of my head since.<br />The thousands of albums of inane, puerile pop phlegm currently mass-produced in soulless studios the world over could never replace this one deep and moving disc.<br />Johnny Cash, I'm an ordinary hairy-arsed married bloke. But I truly love you.
B00003CXE7|5.0|A great movie.<br />Stunning battle scenes.<br />Overall good story that may lag a little at times.<br />Joaquin Phoenix should have won Best Supporting Actor for this role. One of the best movie Heels ever.<br />A true Classic movie from modern times.<br />Recommend to everyone.
B0000062S0|3.0|I have to admit, Walking Into Clarksdale doesn't often make it into the CD player these days. That's not to say it never does, but I'd have thought I wouldn't be able bring myself to take any new Page/Plant disc out of the changer at all! Sadly this is not the case. WIC hints at what might have been, with Jimmy's driving riff work, backed up by solid rhythms from Charlie and the other dude. Robert can still sing fabulously when he wants, but it sounds like his heart wasn't in this project. The songs are good, but few stand out. And who the hell decided that that dreadful discordant cacophony Upon A Golden Horse should make the final cut? I always program that one out. Most High is perhaps the most inventive and exciting track on the disc, and the only one which has lodged itself firmly in my brain. If only the rest of the album was of similar standard.<br />I think WIC is indicative of Page and Plant reaching the end of the line in terms of a musical relationship. Not enough of the old magic remained to make this the shattering achievement it should have been, and though Jimmy can still rock when he wants, Plant sounds like he's just treading the mill.<br />Before Napster was screwed over by the music conglomerates I managed to download some fantastic new bootleg recordings of Robert in concert with the Priory Of Brion and latterly Strange Sensation. He sounds far more energised than anything from the WIC period. Freed from the shackles of expectation that come with any Page/Plant collaboration, Robert sounds like he's come alive once more, and I now wait in high anticipation of his (apparently) forthcoming new solo album. <br />If you were thinking of buying WIC, I'd save the money and wait as well. WIC is not a bad album by any means, but it's no Fate Of Nations. I'd prefer even Coverdale Page on the whole.
B00004TRD8|5.0|This movie is a masterpiece.<br />A truly original and fantastic story presented in flawless faction.<br />One of the best, if not THE best, action movies of all time.<br />I've watched this DVD over and over and messed with the extras a bunch of times for the past few months, and I don't think I've seen half of the stuff on it.<br />There are 15 deleted scenes that you can watch in sequence with the movie.<br />If you've seen this movie a hundred times, but have never seen this DVD version, you will be blown away by the extended version.<br />Also includes other deleted scenes and the original ending among tons and tons of extras.<br />This DVD is worth the price you pay and then some.
6302902010|5.0|I have read through the eighty-some posts here and was surprised to read over and over &quot;I want to see the 'original' with Sidney Poitier...&quot; <br />The &quot;original&quot; opera opened in 1935 and starred Todd Duncan and Anne Brown. Selection from this original production are available on Decca records (recently re-issued on CD). Also, on a CD entitled &quot;Gershwin Plays Gershwin&quot; there are excerpts from rehearsals of the original production!<br />In the 1950s, Porgy and Bess was mounted on Broadway as a musical as opposed to its original operatic form. All of the recitative was replaced with dialogue. So much of Gershwin's amazing score was cut. This is the form of Porgy that was used for the Preminger film. It is not the Porgy and Bess that Gershwin intended - but only a &quot;Readers Digest&quot; version.<br />At about the same time, Lyontine Price was touring in a new production of Porgy and Bess which brought the opera back to the public and which made her a star. There is an &quot;excepts&quot; version of this production which is nothing less than electrifying. It is a crime that Price never recorded a complete Porgy and Bess. She was a GREAT Bess.<br />The next great production would come in the 70s with the Houston Opera's production, which is still considered definitive.<br />I have seen the Glyndebourne Opera version when it was broadcast on TV, and I thought it was beautiful. The settings are very natural and the acting is quite good.  One very unfortunate cut in this production (or at least from the DVD) is Porgy's &quot;Buzzard Song&quot;, which is one of my favorite arias from the opera.<br />I now finally have the DVD version, and the sound is very clear and well balanced.  Using Dolby Pro-logic, there is a good separation between voice and orchestra.<br />Try to get the Hollywood version out of your head and enjoy Porgy and Bess the way the Gershwins and DuBose Heyward intended it. It is THE great American opera and deserves nothingless.
B00003CXGG|1.0|Wow! Jet Li! How fantastic!<br />Wait a second...he's on wires.<br />Bah!<br />All the wires couldn't keep this movie from sinking like a rock.<br />Over-rated and nowhere near as good as a Jackie Chan movie.<br />Chan is the real deal...Jet Li is the reel deal :P
B00004XQ83|5.0|These words apply to both the selected songs on this album, and the number of truly great movie soundtracks.  Even the best soundtracks have at least some filler, some weak, uninspired track choices, or ...  covers to serve as vehicles for empty, insipid singles (I think you all know the kind).  If you've seen this movie you know how perfectly each song fit its respective scene and vice versa.  But even if you haven't seen the movie, each and every song stands on its own.  The Coens had to reach deep into the well to pull up some of these ditties, but you'll find it was worth it.  <br />The older tunes on here, namely &quot;Big Rock Candy Mountains&quot;, recall a time before political correctness and social responsibility entered the conscience of blues or folk music, when country music truly was made for and by ne'er-do-wells.  At the other end, you have the soulful, unforced gospel tracks.  This is country music at its best: earthy, primitive and mischievous.  <br />If you feel even a little bit of visceral connection to America's past, this soundtrack will tickle you.
B00000G3Q4|5.0|If you are looking for a great date movie, then look no further than this.<br />The spookiest of the trilogy, this movie will amaze you if you've never seen it.<br />If you've already seen it, it will still amaze you.<br />Way beyond it's time, this horror movie series is set apart from all others.<br />This is the movie that all the others were trying to be.
B00000253N|5.0|If Blood on the Tracks existed in a vacuum, and we didn't even know who Bob Dylan was, the astonishment over this album would be no greater - even though we know what came before, and what an incredible lyricist Bob is, this album is still a stunner.  Some of the most beautiful lyrics in the history of song are on this album.  The highlights include just about everything.  If You See Her Say Hello is heartbreaking, as is You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go.  Idiot Wind is the best kiss-off song since Don't Think Twice, It's Alright.  Tangled Up in Blue and Simple Twist of Fate are two of the greatest songs ever written, period.  If you like Dylan, and don't have this album - do not delay!  If you think you hate Dylan, and don't have this album, you have a big surprise coming yourself.  A lot of people on here are calling this the best album ever - well, my favorite changes from day to day, but I will say this, this is in my Top Twenty every day.  A masterpiece, and I don't use that word lightly.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Older people don't like this movie, because it calls for completely destroying the world they created.<br />Remember how your parents hated the music you listened to? The same goes for this movie.<br />Totally and delightfully twisted, this movie is so completely over-the-top and original, it's more fun to watch the second time than the first.<br />I must warn you that it's not for everyone.<br />Anyone who is totally conformed to society and wallows in it's structure will be horrified by this movie.<br />Everyone else will pretty much like it.<br />It's very violent and cerebral.<br />You'll find yourself grinning ear-to-ear at things you were always told were bad.<br />A very surprising movie.<br />If you've never seen it before...WATCH IT NOW!
B0000025CP|5.0|This great album was so influential to other bands when it was released.  It is what launched the NWOBHM.  &quot;Stained Class&quot; is a product of complete origional though since noibody elese was doing music like this at the time.   true metal classic by the most dynamic force metal has ever seen--Judas Priest.
B00003CXN4|3.0|Overall, the movie was good at best. I am a huge movie fan, but this one is only worth watching once.<br />I was impressed with Benicio Del Toro, who pulled off his most subtle performance yet.<br />He should have gotten the Oscar for his role in &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot; rather than for this movie.<br />Catherine Zeta-Jones was exceptional in her role, which in my opinion was the most interesting character in the movie.<br />If you have heard lots about it, but haven't seen it yet...forget everything you've heard and go in expecting very little.<br />If you've never heard of it before, then I suggest watching it, it may, or may not, be your cup of tea.
B000055Y0X|5.0|while kubrick was a master of (among other things) wit, this one was his most straightforwardly silly and excellent comedy.  sellers comes in with 3 amazing performances.  100% worth owning and watching.  one of the greatest of comedy cinema and bound to leave its mark for hundreds of years in the future
B00003CX8J|2.0|It's really too bad the timing of this movie didn't coincide with the mid-80's when the X-Men were red hot.<br />Hugh Jackman was a little better than I expected, but I expected so much more.<br />The DVD's screen test with Jackman in it left you with little doubt that he is a true actor.<br />But the acting he performed in his screen test was better than anything he did in the movie.<br />It's ok at best...even if you are a die-hard X-Men fan.
6304698798|5.0|2 of the masters of cinema (especially western cinema) collide for the last in the man with no name trilogy.  this is the most highly regarded and best of the series.  brilliant, great, and awesome are the words to describe it.  if you're not a fan of westerns, give this one a chance, and if you are, you've probably already seen it.  too bad leone didn't make more movies
B00004YYDI|5.0|I saw The Professional, and, to tell the truth, wasn't that intersted in watching it again.<br />It was the 'Uncut' in this version's title that piqued my interest enough to give it a second chance.<br />I can't tell you how glad I was to see this version.<br />This is my most-watched DVD and my most-borrowed DVD.<br />My sister watched it 5 times in a 48 hour period.<br />The bond that these 2 characters share is quite touching indeed.<br />Leon: The Professional is movie-making the way it should be.<br />The story is the heart of the movie, and this movie will stay close to your heart.
B00003CXA2|2.0|tom hanks in with a typically dull and overrated performance and zemeckis showing off his post-back to the future boringness.  very long and tiresome, but not without its moments.  very sentimental and some decent special effects.  a not so bad performance by gary sinise as well.  not worth a watch unless you're really curious what the hype's all about.  stick with roger rabbit, used cars, and bttf 1-3
B00003A9QL|5.0|When I first heard that song on college radio, I mistook it for a Dream Theater song. I have all their albums but I hadn't heard that song. Did they have a new album? Nope, said their website. I finally found out that it was Metallica. So, it occurs to me that Metallica fans might want to know about an alternate source for the type of music here on this album. No, D-T's keyboardists Kevin Moore, Derek Sherinian and Jordan Rudess (in that order over seven albums) don't really hit the level of Michael Kamen and the San Francisco Symphony but add leader John Petrucci on a very heavy guitar and you've got a BIG sound out of 4 players. Plus, James LaBrie's vocals are a lot like Lars Ulrich's. Try 'em, you'll like 'em!
0790749815|5.0|one of hitchcock's best movies, this really introduced me to cary grant and solidified hitchcock's work for me.  hitchcock came out of the 40s (all those collaborations with selznick were HORRIBLE) with a bang and this excellent thriller segued movies into the 60's.  a very 60's feel with amazing script, acting (i thought cary grant was going to be a priss until i saw this, now i'm a true fan), direction, cinematography, editing.  the only complaint is overlength, but it actually works to its advantage since the movie is so involving!!
B0000508U6|5.0|A beautifully crafted, yet modest debut album. Can Coldplay emulate this one? <br />The shimmering guitar accompaniement to Martin's reassurances that we live in a beautiful world on &quot;Don't Panic&quot; eases you into the album only to be jolted by the Radioheadesque riffs of &quot;Shiver&quot;.<br />The wonderful post-chorus interplay of drum and guitar on &quot;Spies&quot; lifts you over the self-conscious musings of Mr. Martin while &quot;Trouble&quot; echoes a Pink Floyd influence which I sense others haven't noticed. Chris Martin can boast the most distinctive voice since Gomez's Ben Ottewell and Richard Ashcroft will be wishing he could have captured the lingering atmospheric rhythym of &quot;High Speed&quot;.<br />I didn't think I'd get hooked on an album as quickly as U2 reeled me in with &quot;All that you...&quot;, but I admit defeat. Keep it simple guys, it's brilliant.
0780020685|1.0|kurosawa is one of the great directors of all-time - this is an almost undisputed fact, even by me.  however, people fail to mention that all but 1 or 2 of his movies are deathly boring.  seven samurai goes on for 3 hours, and even with action sequences, fails to enthrall.  truly boring and not worth the time unless you're a scholar of good direction.
0930289234|4.0|For myself, I'd probably stick _Watchmen_ somewhere between 4 and 5 stars.  For casual readers who are not as well-versed in comic books, however, I give this book a 4.  This is a good work, and I won't say &quot;for a comic book,&quot; because it has to be understood that just as cinema does something that novels aren't expected to, so do comic books.  There are several media for entertainment, and the comic book or &quot;graphic novel&quot; is one of these.<br />Anyhow, this is one of the better comic books that I've read.  I think it would probably entertain most people (though I must say, it is not for children) who could bring themselves to lay aside their intellectual snobbery and pick up a comic book for once.  It's also pretty well-laden with underlying visual repetitions and symbolism, as the various &quot;Annotated Watchmen&quot; sites on the internet attest.  I'd say at best it's a good yarn, and at times even quite emotional, and at worst it can degenerate into something a bit melodramatic and full of itself.  And again, it's a mature story--the comic book trappings belie some of its (for better or worse) somewhat objectionable content.  Yet the worst moments are few, and the best are good enough that they far more than overbalance the bad ones.  I'd say that the net result is a good one...if you're a serious comic book fan, you should read this.  If you want to know what the genre can do, you should read this.  If you're just looking for a good story that you don't mind receiving in comic book form, you'd do well to give this a try.
0783225857|5.0|peck turns in a great performance (and so does robert duvall in his debut) in one of the most awesomely done black and white classics.  amazingly contemporary cinematography and direction give way to a highly interesting and very well written story with tons of great characters.  this movie comes very highly recommended as one to own.
0767802470|5.0|All of the great things that have been said so far are true.  This is truly a great film.  Besides the realistic nature of the film (the film makers found the original blue prints of the depicted sub and had the original manufacturer build a replica), I also found it fascinating to see a WWII film presented from the German perspective. Unlike most movies on this subject, the German crew of the sub are not Nazis...just soldiers doing their job, and trying to stay alive.  Despite the film's length, it seems to go by pretty quickly...if you have any interest at all in this genre..definitely see this film.
B00003RQNJ|2.0|despite the fact that i love paul newman, this movie is pretty awful.  some decent cinematography and good moments with newman can't make up for the fact that redford can't act and the script is hollow.  not much happens and we go on a journey to nowhere.  not recommended.  highly overpraised
B000003EPN|5.0|There are many good recordings of Verdi's Masterpiece. The DG D. Fisher-Diskau/Bergonzi/Scotto also stands out mainly because of its Duke who  s h i n e s! To me, Bergonzi IS the ideal Duke. However, we must keep in mind that the opera is called Rigoletto and not \\"the Duke\\". Some prefer the Milnes/Pavarotti/Sutherland. It's a popular recording but not without flaws. This Solti set, ideally balanced, will give you the essence of Rigoletto.<br />Robert Merrill as \\"povero\\" Rigoletto captures both drama and music of the role. He has a powerful, rich voice ideal for such Verdi roles. Although I mentioned my preference to Bergonzi, Alfredo Kraus is not less memorable. I especially admire his \\"posente amor\\", truly remarkable. As Gilda we hear a young, fresh Anna Moffo in one of her best moments. Exquisite singing and a convincing portrait of the young girl make her my first choice for Gilda. Let me not forget the rest of the cast that does a fine job too. <br />Superb Maestro Solti completes this thrilling account of Rigoletto. A must even if you have other versions.
B00003CXC7|2.0|i'm a fan of typically hitchcock's earlier (30s) and later (50s-70s) work, but this classic just didn't cut it with me.  extremely boring despite some good acting, cinematography and directing.  the script is extremely lukewarm however and wants you to sit through absolute nothingness forever!!  i would not recommend this one, but i'm sure friends of yours already have.  oh well..
0312243022|2.0|I really didn't think this book deserved a Pulitzer. I have read many more richer and more satisfying novels.  In fact I hated the book and wish I hadn't invested the time reading it.  I'm sorry
6305622930|1.0|i expected patton to be an explosive character study of an explosive man.  i came 10 minutes into it and i was already bored.  with all the big names (coppola on script, schaffner on direction, etc.) you'd think it'd be amazing, but it's a truly boring and unintimate portrait of a generally interesting man.  far too over long, its only saving grace is a dynamite performance by george c. scott (when wasn't he dynamite?).  not worth watching whatsoever
B00004XQ83|5.0|My dad received this CD for father's day, at the behest of my brother, and told him, though he hadn't seen the movie yet, that he'd love it.  He opted to wait two days, til we had seen the movie before opening the CD, but since then it has penetrated every wall in our house.<br />5 minutes into this movie, you can tell the supreme effort put into compiling this collection of music, which perfectly compliments the mood and setting of the film.  From Big Rock Candy Mountain (which I consider the perfect &quot;campfire song&quot;) to Man of Constant Sorrow, the 19 songs on this album will stick to your brain like peanutbutter on crackers.  With the push from this movie, the re-advent of bluegrass and &quot;old country&quot; is gaining steam, and has broadened my musical appreciation.  Thanks to the Coens, for helping revive this lost and unappreciated art.
B00003CXA2|5.0|This movie was one of the best movies I have ever seen. Tom Hanks did a terrific job throughout the whole movie. I laughed, got sad, and felt heart-warmed by everything in the movie. I recommend this movie to everyone who likes a good laugh and very well-done acting.
079073382X|5.0|Before Sunrise is far from a polished movie.  It doesn't involved carfully choreographed explosion sequences, and whiz-bang car chase shoot-outs.  Though some would consider this a fault, I find this especially why I love the movie.<br />For those who haven't seen, the movie essentially takes place during one night in Europe.  Hawke has to exit a train after having briefly conversed with Delpy, and invites her to come with him and keep him company for the night while he waits for his transfer.  She adventurously accepts, and the night is spent walking the city as the two probe each other's minds and discover they like what they find.<br />Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy's performances are so raw and realistic that you get the feeling a truly romantic and intelligent movie without the help of a James Horner score.  More than being just a romantic movie, in illustrates the beauty of conversation, the thrill of doing something foolish, the beauty of finding wonder in the commonplace, and the wonder of finding beauty in another.<br />This movie is not a sappy emotional mess, like many of the pathetic excuses for movies we see these days.  I am a guy, and even I enjoyed this movie for its incredible ingenuity.  If you want to see an intelligent, interesting, different movie, see this completely underappreciated sleeper and tell your friends about it.
B00001NFCY|5.0|I don't understand all these people slamming creed because the band dares to use Christian lyrics. Kudos to them for having the courage to sing about god and faith instead of gangbangin' . I don't care what label they sing under, they get five stars in my book just for singing a lyric without cursing!
6304458924|5.0|Although some of the reviews on here are less than flattering, I enjoyed this movie.<br />As a Flight Attendant, I like any airline related movies. This one was really good. Actually, for me it is one of those that you watch again and again until you can literally recite the lines. <br />If you like Air Force One, Passenger 57, etc. then you will probably enjoy turbulence.<br />Another GREAT one is called Free Fall. It airs on Fox Family.
B000002GYI|5.0|A true work of genius by the boyz of Dusseldorff, COMPUTER WORLD is the band's most consistent piece of work (werk?). Eerily prophetic in its themes, KRAFTWERK not only predicts the total computerization of the world (welt?), but actually also forsees the advent of cybersex by almost twenty years!!
6303921248|5.0|This film is absolutely wonderful. I saw it for the first time because my aunt made me. I must say that I didn't have very high expectations for it at all, because it seemed to be boring to me, as a ten year old. But I instantly fell in love with the movie. It became a classic in my mind. A movie that I could never live without (yes I realize I may be exaggerating a bit.) I've seen it so many times that I have every line memorized, and yet, every time I watch it, it seems new and, dare I repeat, wonderful. The acting is absolutely splendid, when you realize how much effort it would take to act in a film that took place in a time period so foreign from your own. They performed it wondefully. I love the story as well. It's what I would call the perfect romance movie, the kind you just cannot finish until the girl gets the guy (or the guy gets the girl.) Every time I start watching I can't stop watching it until it's over, and even then, I usually start it over again, just because I'm so sorry to see it end.  The scenery is absolutely lovely. Whenever I watch it, it makes me jealous because I want to be in England and, surprisingly, I want to live in that time period. I love the costumes, they are extremely beautiful. Every aspect of the movie seems absolutely perfect.
0790736039|1.0|This movie is by far the worst, along with Saturday Night Fever. I watched this by accident when I was very young and it terrified me. The only thing worth saying about this movie is that it is TRASH!  I think a garbage can is where it belongs. Now if you want entertainment that you can actually sit down and *enjoy*, I strongly recommend &quot;Anne of Green Gables.&quot;
B000002UB3|5.0|In a very brief period (62-70) the Beatles changed Rock 'n Roll. It's crazy to imagine the many different sounds each respective album has; from their early pop to Abbey Road's polished sound. Infact, it is the last two albums (Let it be and Abbey Road), which remain my favorites. By this time the group had grown up and had grown tired of each other. But to force themselves to create this masterpiece is remarkable. The beauty of this album is that each member contributed, each stamping their greatness. The songs are all familiar and loved by many. Beyond the music, they had the best album covers. This album is a must for anyone with a pair of ears.
0380789019|5.0|If you like Clive Barker, you'll love this.  Very interesting and imaginative.  I hope he writes more tales along these lines.  Fast paced.  Did not want to put it down.  Horrific and suspensful.. just a great read.
B00003CXIY|4.0|Why is this DVD classed as unrated?  I just bought the Australian Unrated version, which was touted as &quot;Unseen &amp; Explicit&quot; on the cover, but, if I had to think of three word to describe this cut of the film, &quot;Unrated&quot;, &quot;Unseen&quot; and &quot;Explicit&quot; would not be those words. . If you were hoping to catch a bit more of the video-scene, you will be disappointed. . Hell, even the Eel's Video Clip included in the DVD's special feature has been censored.  The word &quot;goddamn&quot; has been replaced by &quot;&lt;unexpected &amp; untimely silence&gt; damn&quot;. . If you love Road Trip - buy it, but don't be misled about what you're getting.
0792839749|3.0|When I was five, I saw &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.&quot; My dad said I fell asleep during it because it was too long. Thirty-two years later, it's still too long.<br />This is decent family fare, and has some wonderful moments (for one, who would have thought Dick Van Dyke was such a good dancer?), and has terrific production values, but it's overlong and overblown. <br />Take the opening sequence, for example: it takes about 10 minutes just to fill in the backstory of the car that would become Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, and by the time it's done, we're not even sure what it has to do with the story. Wouldn't it have been more fun for the characters to come upon a car with a mysterious background, and find out the story later? The same can be said of the musical numbers, some of which go on far too long. <br />The net result is a children's movie with an intermission, which is a prescription for failure. <br />That's a shame, because this film has many strengths. It's chock full of good humor and energy, the gadgets and the Chitty Chitty Bang Bang car are ingenious and engaging, and Van Dyke's performance is very entertaining. I've seen the special effects maligned, but I found them to be pretty convincing, especially for 33-year-old work. <br />I also liked the camera work and English scenery.<br />However, after a while, the endless musical numbers get tiresome (they're not that great to begin with, particularly when you compare them to similar sequences in films of that era like &quot;The Sound of Music,&quot; or even &quot;Oliver!&quot;), and the happy banter gets a bit too sweet. If the film had been shortened, and the weaker musical numbers edited out, it would have been far snappier and more fun.<br />&quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot; was written by Ian Fleming and produced by Albert Broccoli, who are better known respectively as the writer of the James Bond books and the producer of the Bond movies, and you can actually see the Bond formula in this film.After all, the title is about a gadget-laden car (though Bond's 1977 Lotus Esprit submarine from &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; is still my favorite), and the heroine is named Truly Scrumptious. If that one wouldn't get laughts in a bond movie, what would? Gert Frobe and Desmond Llewellyn, better known as Auric Goldfinger and &quot;Q&quot; from the Bond series, make appearances.<br />Also, look for Benny Hill (less the half-naked tarts, of course) as a toymaker.<br />I suppose the length of this film does have a good point: kids LOVE this movie, so if you need a few hours alone, just pop this baby in and you're all set.
B00003CXAA|5.0|With so many other people reviewing &quot;The Godfather&quot; (1,2 &amp; 3), I've decided not to say too much.Read the other reviews and pre-order yours on DVD... now!
B0000025CP|5.0|This album rules!  Judas Priest are at their best in every second of this masterpiece!  &quot;Stained Class&quot; influenced so many at the time of its release too.  One of the best metal albums ever!!!
B000053VAF|5.0|Another great film from Kevin Smith.  As always with all of Smith's dvds, the extra features are fabulous.  Be sure to check out his other films on dvd if you haven't already.
0446310786|5.0|Atticus Finch, the unforgettable protagonist of Harper Lee's masterpiece, To Kill A Mockingbird, provides the premise for the novel early on when he states to his daughter, Scout, \\"You never really know about another person until you walk around in his skin for a while and feel it.  Then you start to see what life is like from his eyes.\\"  Told in the first person, the book is narrated by eight-year-old Jean-Louse \\"Scout\\" Finch, a motherless tomboy, who encounters many adventures and learns several lessons in the rural town of Maycomb, Alabama during the Great Depression.  With Scout's elder brother, Jem, by her side, she struggles to accept the racial and economic barriers which had, for too long, separated the townspeople of Maycomb.  To Kill A Mockingbird is a love letter to a community steeped in hypocrisy and injustice; the novel suggests that the chains of the Old South would eventually change due, in part, to individuals such as Scout's sagacious and determined father, Atticus.  When Scout's father, a local prominent attorney, agrees to defend a local Negro worker accused of raping a white woman, Scout begins to recognize the cancer that has all but choked Maycomb out of existence.  As a result of the trial Scout loses her innocence and gains the wisdom that despite ancient grudges it is time for a change in Maycomb.        Characterization is a vital ingredient to the success of To Kill a Mockingbird.  Harper Lee breathes life into all of her characters; she provides them with not only an outward appearance that rings true, but with also a motivation to every action that is plausible because the author makes the reader walk in each character's shoes.  The novel possesses as many memorable figures as any other novel in American history.  In particular, Scout, who narrates the book, is transformed from a highly naive and impulsive little girl to a perceptive and sensitive individual by novel's end.  Jem, Scout's brother, converts from boyhood to manhood and gains a new respect an understanding for his surroundings.  Unlike his children, Atticus remains remarkably true to his character throughout Lee's memoir.  His character is so unforgettable that he remains as the most conspicuous role model for both fathers and lawyers in American literature forty years after the publication of the book.  Another memorable figure in the novel, Tom Robinson, is a hardworking, caring, and honest \\"Negro\\" who is falsely accused of raping a white woman.  Tom symbolizes the plight of all African Americans at the time where prejudice and injustice were commonplace.  Perhaps the most compelling figure in Lee's work is the mysterious phantom of the town, Arthur Radley.  He remains inside his house down the street from the Finches', a recluse who is neither seen nor heard.  Arthur, better known as \\"Boo\\", provides the basis for many rumors and stories that keep the gossips guessing in the small community.  \\"Boo\\" is thus held responsible for many ills and faults of the town.  The mystery of \\"Boo\\" dominates the imagination and nightmares of Scout and Jem.        The characters of the novel contain weaknesses as well as strengths.  Lee's novel possesses accurate points of view for the time period that adds to the incredible realism that is conveyed through each individual's personality.  Harper Lee's descriptive style provides the reader with remarkable characters and remarkable settings.  The attention Lee focuses on small details brings To Kill a Mockingbird to life.  Most scenes are enhanced by strong dialogue; dialogue that is particularly evident in the riveting courtroom scene that stays with the reader long after he or she has put it down.  An example of Harper Lee's vibrant prose can be found when she sets the scene for 1933 Maycomb: \\"Maycomb was an old town, but it was a tired old town when I first knew it.  In rainy weather the streets turned to red slop; grass grew on the sidewalks, the courthouse sagged in the square.  Somehow, it was hotter then: a black dog suffered on a summer's day; bony mules hitched to Hoover carts flicked flies in the sweltering shade of the live oaks on the square.  Men's stiff collars wilted by nine in the morning.  Ladies bathed before noon, after three-o'clock naps, and by nightfall were soft like teacakes with frostings of sweat and sweet talcum.\\"        The several themes communicated through Harper Lee's brilliant plausible characters tie the novel together creating a beautiful masterpiece.  A classic that ten years from now you will be able to pick up again and enjoy even more the second or third time.  I am thankful to Harper Lee for allowing me to imagine walking around in the shoes of her characters.
B00000IBVC|5.0|This version of Turandot in the Forbidden City is absolutely marvelous. The scenery, colours, singing, dancing is stupendous. Opera from now on can only be heard and seen on DVDs and Turandot in this setting creates an awesome experience.
B00005B4GU|5.0|There are so many mixed reviews for this album and Kid A and it basically boils down to that this equisite group of talented musicians didn't want to be the next, radio-friendly alternative rock band.  And why should they?  Why should they sell-out just to improve their marketing? The point is they don't need to, and instead of your everyday catchy tunes, they went a different route.  They turned out to be one of the most innovative and creative bands in alternative rock today.  I believe they are the future of rock.  This album is fresh with new ideas and concepts.  Give it a dozen listens and watch it grow on you.  It's a remarkable piece of work.
B00005B4GU|2.0|I don't care if this album is &quot;innovative,&quot; &quot;envelope-pushing,&quot; or any other euphemistic adjectives that people are currently using to describe this album.  The bottom line is that much of it is difficult to listen to.  While that may make the album &quot;challenging,&quot; it certainly doesn't make it good.  Some tracks, like #2, have beautiful pieces of music arranged in unorthodox ways; unfortunately, those tracks are the exception because  much of the rest of the album is just bland and confusing music.  I actually think that Kid A had better music by virtue of the fact that I can actually listen to the first half of the album.
0060920084|2.0|I purchased this book after I finished reading another of Bryson's books, \\"A Walk in the Woods.\\" What a mistake.  Bryson's attempts at humor in this book aren't all that funny. His observations about people and places seem unnecessarily cruel. Prehaps Bryson needs to be reminded that the people he makes fun of in this book aren't cardboard cutouts in the landscape of his reality, they are human beings.     I have to contrast his views on small town America with those of the late Charles Kuralt. Kuralt always managed to find beauty in the places he visited and goodness in the people he met.  Bryson, on the other hand, fails to see the prosperity that the endless fields in the heartland represent. His constant need to demean and make fun of the people who cross his path makes me wonder what could possible motivate him to be so mean-spirited.    Might I suggest that Bryson take a tour of a ravaged African nation...prehaps he might come back a greater appreciation of this nation and its people.
6303617719|5.0|The critics were wrong about this movie. SO wrong!  &quot;French Kiss&quot; is fabulously sweet, quirky, funny, loveable and charming! Kevin and Meg are wonderful and they have a good supporting cast.  Meg is at her most charming and Kevin is a very appealing Frenchman!  They are adorable together and the movie is cute and fun.  &quot;French Kiss&quot; has a variety of scenes (sad, funny, sweet, silly and serious); has many quotable lines (&quot;I don't like the way you say with your face all scrunched up 'Your French aren't you?'&quot; &amp; &quot;Just feel guilty. Swim in it until your fingers get all pruney&quot; &amp; &quot;Do I have to say it!?&quot; - &quot;Am I going to be able to stop you!?&quot;); beautiful music and spectacular scenery.  The cutest/funniest scenes are right after she eats a bunch of cheese; when she shows him the necklace she is wearing; the accident with the dessert cart and the beach scene.  Such an enchanting movie!  Don't listen to the critics... you will love it!
0060934700|5.0|Every now and then a reviewer uses the words &quot;every now and then&quot; to start a review.  It usually is followed by a glimmering review of a very artsy, very bad book.  With this book, though, it is completely appropriate.  It is appropriate to say that every now and then a story collection comes along that will, in the end, change the way we read short stories.  The last time this happened was, perhaps, King's &quot;Night Shift.&quot;  Before that, pick any Ray Bradbury collection.<br />But Gaiman's collection is both and more put into one.  &quot;Smoke and Mirrors&quot; is absolute masterpiece and seems like it would satisfy almost any avid reader's tastes.  There is the humor, social commentary, poetry of all kinds and even a few examples of remarkably tasteful erotica included in this timeless collection.  The dark side of the reader is revealed in a reassuring and, at the same time, frightening way.  Reading Gaiman is not mere recreation, it is experience.  This reviewer did not take long to complete these pages, despite a relatively busy work schedule.  When it was over, it leaves disappointment that stems from the fact that the book was over, finished.  Yet it is a fulfilling, and wonderful experience.  It is not bogged down by &quot;trying to make a point,&quot; despite the points it does make on the reader.  It is simply telling a story, and the reader takes it as he or she wishes.  This, in the end, is the essence of writing, and Gaiman has mastered it perfectly.<br />The stories are diverse; humor and dark, poetry and prose.  However, no matter which story you read one thing remains constant: Gaiman's superb ability in the art of storytelling.<br />Writing short stories is an art of the most refined form, and Gaiman has done more than lead the art form or change the art form.  He has transcended it and made it his own.<br />Every now and then a story collection comes along that will, in the end, change literature.  Here and now, that collection is &quot;Smoke and Mirrors.&quot;quot;Smoke and Mirrors.&quot;
B000050IMJ|3.0|I guess I'd have to say this is a guy movie. Even though I really like Nicolas Cage, even he could not make this movie interesting for me.  Based on the previews I really wanted to see this movie ... but I was disappointed when I finally did watch it.  There are some good lines in it and Nicolas is good as always and the car chase scenes are fun to watch... but all in all I prefer a movie with more substance.  So, my recommendation is to go ahead and see the movie... just don't expect any meat ... just watch it for the cars and the action. (and for Nicolas!)
B00004XOWM|1.0|What happened? Yes, I am another person who enjoyed thier first cd and thought they sucked after that. Limp Bizkit is a trend that nobody will remember in 5 years. The next generation of musicians will be laughing at Limp Bizkit. This cd is beyond bad. This cd compells me to hurl. If you wanna hear something good, go listen to deftones or glassjaw or system of a down. This is bad. But I don't expect to change anybodies opinion.. most people either love them or hate em.. ehh.. if you watch trl alot you will probably like this.
6300263673|5.0|This is a movie set in a camp, really breathless location; the campiness is a integral part of the movie. forbidden love with a dangerous Patrick Swayze - enough to make anyone feel mushy. The moves and the dancingin the movie are something else - makes you wanta try them the next time you are on your feet!<br />Light romantic movie - great picturization!
6304595247|1.0|I rented this movie because I have recently read Wuthering Heights and now feel that I understand it, and because I adore Ralph Fiennes.  But I turned it off after about 25 minutes because I just couldn't watch anymore.  Not even accurate, though it is supposedly more accurate than the one from the 40's.  I still adore Ralph, and I still think Juliette Binoche is a wonderful actress, but this movie is not worth wasting the money on.
6300213668|5.0|I saw this movie first when I was 16, it was the best - still has extremely fond memories. It's a movie which would get to every heart. <br />I know the mania it created when it was first launched - boys started walking like John Travolta and girls wanted to changeover their image from the goody-goody Sandy to the sexy Sandy. <br />A must see and the soundtrack is even better if possible!
B00005K3OT|3.0|If you're a guy. Skip it. If you are a woman. Buy it and torchure your boyfriend/husband for a couple of hours.
B000053V7Q|5.0|This Special Edition is much more than that; It's a whole new movie! It is masterfully re-done--with a perfect build-up from rehearsals to Opening Night. It's the Ultimate Concert--with Elvis in Top Form! His voice is perfect! He's relaxed, funny, looks absolutely awesome, and he's in total control of the whole &quot;Happening&quot;! It is amazing to watch him interact with everyone--and it is equally amazing to see the mutual love and respect between the band, the back-ups, the orchestra and the Man Himself. This Special Edition is a Masterpiece! If you're a fan you will be in heaven...if you're not, then you will at least understand while others are!
B00005BJ2O|4.0|i just got this cd 5 days a go and i can't stop listening to it.  There is a lot of remakes on the cd, but they are done so well, this is not a second-rate cd, it's done with taste.  I have to say that my favorite song is Complainte de la Butte, but that's because i like Rufus Wainwright's accent.
B0000542D1|5.0|For everyone who has loved the Beatles, this is a must see video!It is brilliantly directed by Lester, the first &quot;music video&quot; I can ever remember. It is zany and poignant at the same time. It is a joy, but also brought on much melancholia . Such energy, what a joy to see the moptops again, happy and full of potential. As I watched it I couldn't help think of John's life. If he only knew how many people miss him and love him to this day. See this film, all you baby-boomers. You'll be longing for those days once again.
B00004RHZU|5.0|No one has made an R&B debut that has impressed me half as much as Pink. <br />An album worth every cent. You won't regret this one, hope I've helped you see that.  (Also check out the singles for \\"Lady Marmalade\\" and the soundtrack for the movie \\"Moulin Rouge,\\" both these include the remake of \\"Lady Marmalade\\" with some other talented ladies you might know- Lil' Kim, Mya, and Christina Aguilera. Also worth the money.)
1563890410|4.0|Gaiman takes a look at the nature of Hell in this thought provoking volume of The Sandman series. As Dream enters Hell to correct a heinous act he committed 10,000 years before, Lucifer confronts him. Dream prepared for battle finds instead Lucifer emptying Hell of its denizens and locking the gates. Finally he hands Dream the key to hell. The nature of responsibility, a theme Gaiman often returns to throughout the run of the series, is at the center of this story. Dream is now in possession of what is referred by his sister as \\"the most desirable plot of psychic real estate in the whole order of created things,\\" and now Dream must decide what should be done with it and there is no shortage of suitors. Throughout the story (particularly in the conversation between Lucifer and Dream) Gaiman makes some excellent points about the nature of Hell and the afterlife. While I truly enjoyed the storyline I had difficulty with the simplicity of the ending, which is literally deus ex machina and the focus on the Christian concept of Hell (Lucifer) that seems to lack the overall worldview that is usually found in Sandman.
0064407667|1.0|My aunt asked me to read this book and tell her what it was like.  She's a teacher, so she was planning on giving this book to her kids. Big mistake. This book was bland.  I would say meaner things about it, but I might be kicked off this website.  Not only was the plot a clich, it was a pointless book altogether.  A bunch of orphans who have bad things happen to them, is not nearly a plot.  it is the basis for a plot... but where is the rest of it? It is a definite waste of time.  I urge all of you readers not to read this.  Please.  Spare the world of this book.
B0000542D2|5.0|With today's technology, could someone please tell me the reason why it takes so long to produce this fantstic movie in DVD version? I've been waiting for almost 10 months. I had a video but unfortunately spoiled it.
B000001ESF|4.0|This is a very good concept album for those who are so inclined. I would advise fans of later Rush (Permanent Waves onward) to understand that older Rush is a different animal involving different musical tastes in many ways. However, if you're looking to dig a bit deeper into Rush, then 2112 is a good place to start- a concept album with some pretty rocking moments and the kind of songwriting ambition we just don't see anymore. I'm not sure it's a total success, but you do admire the effort.
0671042858|3.0|Stephen King's The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon is suspenseful and well-written but never kicks it further.  The lead character, nine-year-old Trisha McFarland, has to survive in the woods listening to broadcasts of Boston Red Sox games and (perhaps) stalked by some mysterious creature.  The nature survival bits were more interesting than the stalker.  The author batters the girl up in his usual fashion and pushes her to the edge, figuratively and in reality, but still something is missing.  There is not enough material to sustain the two hundred plus pages (a very small novel for Mr. King) and it would have made a tight, thrilling short story instead.  A quick read but not nearly as engaging as the author's usual efforts.
B00005B36H|5.0|Virtually everything Tool front man Maynard James Keenan works on is worth purchasing. You may even want to buy a few copies of the CDs just so you'll have back ups for when you overplay and exhaust your originals.     It's been a few years now since Tool's last full studio album was released. Tool fans eagerly waited and waited for a new album to be produced. After getting through some legal problems and what not Tool has finally been able to present their fans with a new studio album, \\"Lateralus\\".  Let me be one to tell you that this release is FAR FROM a disappointment!    With it's trancey and yet heavy and powerful melodies, the awesome lyric writing talents of Maynard, not to mention Maynard's fantastic and unique enthralling voice, this CD is yet more proof that Tool is the stuff that REAL rock is made of!     With each album they release it seems to just get better and better. So, in keeping up with this pattern of things, \\"Lateralus\\" has been released and it is indeed by far probably one of the best, if not the over all BEST, album of the year.
B000000OUJ|5.0|This CD is great! It has those wacky RZA beats and meaningful lyrics. You could acually learn something from this. A must own for any fan of the Wu-tang clan
B000002MU3|5.0|Anyone who has followed R.E.M. for any length of time knows that they thrive by doing the unexpected.  Whether it was playing few of their own songs in concert in their early days, bringing out the mandolin for &quot;Losing My Religion,&quot; or following up the gorgeously introspective &quot;Automatic For The People&quot; (the best album of the 1990's) with this blast of a full throttle album, the band has always done its own thing and refused to be confined by any rules others would write for them.<br />So it is rather remarkable that some many so called fans seem to be so surprised by and so down on &quot;Monster.&quot;  The loud raucous guitar the opens the kick of track &quot;What's the Frequency, Kenneth&quot; is a sign of things to come.  It is followed by the wah-wahish feel of the glam era gem &quot;Crush With Eyeliner,&quot; and the rest of the album lives up to the promise of those two tracks.  Sure, it is a far cry from the monumental and extraordinary &quot;Automatic For the People,&quot; but the dramatic shift in gears is vintage R.E.M.
6302759110|5.0|Of all the remakes of Bram Stoker's classic book &quot;Dracula&quot; this one stands out as the best I mean sure the very first Dracula was pretty good,but this one has soo much style to it that is shines spotless.You know this movie reminds me of Star Wars Episode 1 Ultimate Edition Soundtrack cause you know that cd containes every note that John Williams wrote for the film and the original cd contains bits and pieces of it.Well in this case all the other Dracula films are like the original soundtrack for Star Wars 1 and this movie is the ultimate edition cause if you think of it all the others had bits and pieces of the novel and this version contains everything from the original book.Francis Ford Coppola made great use of Bram Stoker's novel.He took all the elements of the book and stretched them waaaaaaaaaaay out and being the original first Dracula film was a mere 75 minutes while with Coppola's excellent use of stretch we get even more of our beloved Dracula to 130 minutes,but ofcourse when your dealing with Francis Ford Coppola his movies are allways looong like The Godfather series.This film is a companion to Kenneth Branagh's Mary Shelley's Frankenstein(1994).They both are more true to the original book than the other films are and M,S,F was produced by Francis Ford Coppola so that might be another reson why they are both alike.Bram Stoker's Dracula,Mary Shelley's Frankenstein,and The Mummy(1999)are all three some what alike cause they are true the original stories and they stretch the elements out to over 2 hours long.Anyway if you are a Dracula movie fan and you haven't seen this movie then you aren't a true fan it shouldn't matter what kind of movie gerne you favor you have to see this movie no matter what so if you haven't seen it yet just trust me and the following several reviewers and buy it I'm sure you'll enjoy it.When I first baught it I watched it every day it was becomming a necessity to my everyday routine.Nominated for 4 Academy Awards and won3 of them for best sound effects edditing,best costume design,and best makeup,and the left over nomination was for best set and art direction.
0780020685|5.0|i don't have much to say about it except that it was masterfully created and filmed by Kurosawa.
B000002KHH|5.0|Cited as the first Heavy Metal album, Black Sabbath's 1970 release of paranoid is an indispensable commodity in any serious Rock N' Rollers historical catalogue.  Mostly penned by bassist Butler, the dark, ostentatious lyrics focus on themes of war, descents into madness, apocalyptic outcomes, and the decadence of the mind by opposing forces.  The bands musical brilliance comes together in 42:06 minutes of throbbing, screaming, pounding, suffering, wonderfully eccentric, transgressing, transcending, melodic praise which cannot be described by any real adjectives within the collection of human diction.  A highly recommended buy for true metal aficionado. Humboldt, Earth
0446677450|5.0|A quick read; not too hard to understand, despite being full of wonderful new paradigms.  It took me about four hours to finish.  Like other reviews said, a lot of concepts and phrases are repeated over and over, but I think that's intentional - because when you STOP and think &quot;didn't this guy already say this.... twice?&quot;  THAT is when the repeated concept sinks in.  The first third was an odd read, rather drawn out, and I had to force myself to suspend belief that nine year olds say things like &quot;Aren't you encouraging me to go to business school for my master's degree?&quot; and &quot;Can you tell me the difference between emotions thinking and the head thinking?&quot;<br />But despite the sometimes flawed delivery, the stunning and invaluable message was quite clear.  Ultimately, the value of the information far outweighed sometimes lackluster &quot;plot methods&quot;, shaky grammar and the occasional ramblings that didn't flow together well.  I'd highly recommend the book nonetheless, as it accomplishes a true epiphany, one of my favorite life experiences, which is to learn something you weren't even aware was worth knowing.  Before reading this book, if I had spent two hours trying to think of all the mental attitudes that differentiate the rich from the poor, I doubt few if any of my ideas would share a home with those in the pages of Rich Dad Poor Dad.  As for providing specific reccomendations on where and how to invest, it doesn't really give any and isn't meant to.  The book gives a knowledge foundation that is essential before even looking for your first investment.  While the focus is on real estate, the most important concepts of the book can be applied to any investment - real estate is not my choice but his experiences with it sure make it sound compelling.<br />One unexpected aspect I found was that you don't need to start with a lot of money to get the ball rolling - in fact you don't really need ANY!  I thought I'd need way more &quot;seed money&quot; than I can afford but now I'm thinking just as Kiyosaki said over and over - &quot;how can I afford it&quot; instead of &quot;I can't afford it&quot;. <br />I'm going to read it again very soon.  And probably again and again.  And I'm definitely looking forward to reading (and playing) Cash Flow Quadrant.<br />The very fact that the reviews here range from raving approval (the majority) all the way to &quot;the worst book I've ever read&quot; highlight the spectrum of attitudes and understanding of wealth and investment in today's society.  It's unlikely that most readers that &quot;got&quot; what Kiyosaki was trying to convey hated the book - on the contrary they're probably like me, having adopted the ideas with vigor and have already taken action.  Then again I imagine some understood it fully, yet still reject the concepts for any of a million reasons.  But you need only one to reject the ideas and hence, stay poor. To be honest, I'm glad some people hate it, because we'll always need people to work for money, instead of having money work for them.  They will put money in my pocket, or should I say, my asset column.
B00004Y6OA|4.0|Van Halen's third album, \\"Women and Children First,\\" was released on March 26th 1980, and it spent thirty-one weeks competing on the billboard charts.  This album is the group's third release of eventually thirteen albums, and it features the musical genius of Producer Ted Templeman and Engineer Donn Landee behind it. While the band had already established themselves as serious Rock N' Rollers in their first two self-titled album's, \\"Women and Children First,\\" solidified the bands existence within the conscious of rock.  The sexually promiscuous and musically charging opening tracks, \\"And the cradle will rock,\\" and \\"Everybody wants some,\\" propelled the album to achieve platinum status in less than three months.  Guitar enthusiasts are sure to relish in lead guitarist Eddie Van Halens solo performances of, \\"Loss of control,\\" and \\"Fools.\\"  &quot;Women and Children First&quot; represents rock in a furiously fast, attention deficit, and radical symposium of sound that has been mimicked by generations of contending bands.  Any serious collector of reputable rock music will have this in their collection.
0385335482|5.0|The first thing that grabbed my attention about this book was definitely the title. I can admit to being a shopaholic, and was ready to read about anothers misadventures involving the ever popular sport. The book was so hard to put down I was reading it for two seconds at each traffic light I came too. Sure, my fiance smirked a bit at the title, but questioned exactly what it was about. All I can say is it is a hilarious story of a writer who's &quot;appointments&quot; often take place in a department store checking out the latest shoes!
6302799066|5.0|This movie is pure genius.  Stanley Kubrick is a brilliant director, and it's movies like this that prove that point even further.<br />Colonel Jack Ripper, concerned with the purity of his fluids, sends a squadron of bombers to the Soviet Union without consulting the President.  Hunkering down in his base office, no one can get in touch with him to send the recall codes.  The Soviets are ready to respond with their own &quot;Doomsday Device,&quot; that promises to wipe out all civilation.  Does the U.S. have time to call off their boys?<br />The names, alone, of the characters will keep you easily amused, added to a fine film.  Anyone named Sargeant &quot;Bat&quot; Guano, &quot;if that is your real name,&quot; has to be amusing.  Sterling Hayden, in one of his best acting performances, plays the perfect colonel-gone-mad Ripper.  George C. Scott, not really known for his comedic roles, is outstanding as General Turgidson.  His straight-guy, take no prisoners attitude is absolutely perfect for this role, and truly adds a lot of color and depth to this &quot;black comedy.&quot;  Peter Sellers has three roles in the movie, including the wacky, losing-all-bodily-control title character, and President Muffley.  His War Room telephone conversations with the Soviet Prime Minister are classicly hysterical, marked with totally outlandish, yet intelligent dialogue.  &quot;No, I am more sorry!&quot;  But the actor that truly stands out is Slim Pickens, as bomber pilot, Captain &quot;King&quot; Kong.  His role at the end of the movie is a part of pop culture that people still talk about today.<br />Overall, this film is nothing short of sensational.  The witty dialogue is perfect, adding to the humorous tones of the storyline.  Kubrick was well ahead of his time in 1964 when this movie was made, and this is seen even more so when viewed today.  This fantastic film is guaranteed to make you laugh out loud.  It's one entertaining ride.
B000002I27|5.0|This cd is the best group of songs that the Doors ever produced. As compared to the echoey distance and relatively unadorned production of the first album, this one reaches new heights in terms of sound and experimentation. Morrison's voice has developed into a rich and vibrant instrument that is equally at home on the bluesy &quot;Love Me Two Times&quot; to the acid jazzy of &quot;Moonlight Drive&quot;. All the songs on this cd are standouts. It almost plays like a concept album. This album is full of isolation and dissatisfaction with American culture and all the materialism that comes along with it. The songs seem to follow a couple striving to find something, to &quot;break on through&quot; and find some spiritual grace. &quot;You're Lost Little Girl&quot; and &quot;Unhappy Girl&quot; both touch on the topic of women empowering themselves as Morrison and Kreiger try to encourage them to &quot;melt your cell today&quot; and &quot;saw through all your bars&quot;. &quot;Moonlight Drive&quot;, &quot;My Eyes Have Seen You&quot;, and &quot;I Can't See Your Face In My Mind&quot; all play as post-modern love songs. Morrison especially shines vocally on &quot;My Eyes...&quot;. And then we have the apocalyptic songs of death and paranoia in &quot;Strange Days&quot;, the spoken and screamed &quot;Horse Latitudes&quot;, and &quot;When the Music's Over&quot;. &quot;The Music's Over&quot; is this cds compliment to &quot;The End&quot; from the first Doors cd. This song is even more desperate with the ending consisting of screams to Jesus to &quot;save us!&quot;. You get the sense that Jim is screaming for anyone, anything to save us and him from destruction. This is the highpoint of the Doors, and along with the first cd, ranks as one of the greatest cds in rock history or music history, period.
0446310786|5.0|I was required to read this book over the summer for an Honors English class for next year. I finished it the week after school was out. It was so full of plot, and so intruiging, that I couldn't put it down. It was so incredible. I never imangined I would enjoy it so much. Harper Lee does a wonderful job setting the scene, especially with the dialect and character development. You see Scout Finch's world just as she would as the events unfold. This is one of the few times I am glad I was required to read a book. If not, I would have never known what lies beneath the cover.
B000002UAO|5.0|this cd has some great paul and george and a nice ringo song, but this is definitely a john album let's go over it song by song. drive my car- a good song with a great beat and piano. the words could be better, but hey, you cant have everything. norwegian wood- george makes the song with his sitar. the words are thought- provoking and different. a classic and one of my favs. go john  you wont see me-this is not a great song, but paul does nice vocals. nowhere man- a very original song with a great 3-part harmony at the beginning. think for yourself- this is a very 'final', slightly angry-sounding george song. paul is great on the fuzz bass.  the word- another original. great words and a great message. another one of my favorites. michelle- a sugary paul song. a classic lovey-dovey type song. what goes on- the only ringo song on the cd. this is a fun song without a 'message.' girl- a sad lennon tune. one of my favorites, this is a good song with a slow beat a great lyrics.<br />im looking through you- nice harmonies and great hammond organ by ringo. in my life- a classic ballad! this is a great song. one of the best on the album. great lyrics and piano by george martin. wait- a basic song. nice guitar but weak lyrics if i needed someone- another good george song, this has nice rhythm. run for you life- the last song on the cd. this is a funny john song (although it is not meant to be). this is a VERY jealous lennon. good guitar. one of my favorites.<br />overall, this is a great cd well worth buying. you will enjoy it.
B000000OQF|5.0|This is by far a classic album. Just the singles &quot;Welcome To The Jungle&quot; and &quot;It's So Easy&quot; give you a vital sign it's a must have. &quot;My Michelle&quot; even shows they've got songwriting talent. I shouldn't have to explain, you should know how classic and put-together this album is. Look at what everyone else has been saying. FOR ONCE IT'S NOT JUST ME!!!
B00000896M|4.0|If you don't know who Blind Guardian is then this isn't the album for you. If you like metal and epic storytelling from midevil times like J.R.R. Tolkien and D&amp;D then this is right up your alley. More of a story concept type album than a rock album like their other ones. I just discovered this type of music after being sick of american metal and its fading quality. Metallica is dead, these guys and bands like Angel Dust, Rhapsody, Kamelot and Iced Earth have taken the reigns of metal and continued on where american artists have sold out. I look forward to buying their other albums.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Basically, tha mutha of all mutha's.  Finally on DVD.  If not crammed with behind-the-scenes, interactive, audio commentary prepare for resistance.  Support for Lucas franchise has been stolen away from rent/car/food/child support payments for years, why stop now?  Because liquidation of assets for Lucas means fun. Buy it.
B00005B36H|5.0|It seems there is a common theme to the reviews for this Album: listen to it a few times.  Who am I to say something different?  Its true.  You do have to listen a few times to grasp the full weight of this album.  For comparrisons sake, it is not quite as heavy as Aenima (weather that is good or bad is up to you).  It is every bit as rich in musical variety, however, from subtle quiet moments to harsh crunching guitar.  It is a very logical progression for the band.  It's not the same old songs resung with new artwork; but its also not so different as to make the group unrecognizable to its core fans (i.e. Metallica).  As far as the best way to approach the songs, I reccomend going with songs 7 (Parabola) and 8 (Ticks and Leeches) first.  They have enough &quot;first time&quot; listen benefit to please any heavy metal/hard rock fan.  After that, move on to tracks 1 and 3.  That should get you into the album; from there the rest of its power will open up before you.
B00003CXDG|5.0|This movie was ausom and one of my favoret action movies. I admit it can get a little far fetched at times but it is good action with stil a good plot (that is hard to find in a action movies thes days,Exit wounds is an example of a pointless movie)
B000000WA4|5.0|This album is simply incredible.  People say Billy Corgan can't sing but he is not only a decent singer but a brilliant songwriter.  From the piano of the opening track to the end of the album there are many different styles presented.  Some don't work as well as others but thats to be expected from such an ambitious and huge album. Mellon Collie proves without a doubt that the Smashing Pumpkins are one of the greatest bands of all time.  The best part of this album is that it's wide variety prevents it from dragging endlessly the way many other attempts at an album of this size would do.  Like the Clash on Sadinista! but in a infinitely more coherent way, the Pumpkins conquer many styles.  From acoustic masterpieces like Stumblein, the techno-ish Cupid de Locke, soft melodies like Tonight and 1979, and especially their signature heavy metal in Bodies and XYU.  I know its a cliche, but this is truly a &quot;Desert Island Album.&quot;  Every fan of music should own it.
B00005B4GU|4.0|A lot like Kid A, and I loved Kid A.  My favorite song is &quot;I might be wrong.&quot;  I like Radiohead's new direction, and people wishing for the older CD's should listen to the CD much more deeply.
B000002H38|5.0|I love this album from start to finish.  Anita is a truly gifted singer.  Although, this is not her fisrt effort, it's definitely the best.  With tracks like 'Been so Long', 'Same Ole Love', and 'Sweet Love' this a CD to have in anybodys collection (especially true Soul fans).
B00005B36H|5.0|i have gone through many cycles with this cd, depending on how my brain is working at the moment... tool is a very important cog in my life, so they're art is subjected to unreasonable persecution by my left brain.  naturally tool simultaneously manages to defy and exceed expectations with this album.  it is a progression from aenima, and it is hard to accept any change because after 4.5 years i know we have all fallen so in love with aenima, one of the greatest albums ever.  but of course tool's style has grown, and there are countless wonders to be found in this new landscape.  in my pure moments i am awed by the sounds tool manages to create.  my brain usually thinks too much while listening to music to truly feel it, and this is a problem, but of course tool is also meant to make you think.  however i think the vibe of this album can be properly expressed in the line maynard sings &quot;overthinking, overanalyzing seperates the body from the mind, withering my intuition...&quot;  it is clear that this album is some sort of map to learn to communicate with yourself and others at a deeper and purer level.  even though i have not learned yet to totally absorb this album, it is an absolute 5 star creation and it is so good to know that this album will be nourishing me for years to come.  and of course as all tool fans know, it just will get better and better, and this is why we don't mind waiting a few more years.  <br />as for a more music oriented review... well damn, all the songs have so many pieces and evolutions... the writing of the music has clearly reached a new level of complexity (i am not a musician so i can not truly appreciate this)  every band member has improved their pieces.  the hardest change to get used to may be maynard's vocals/lyrics which are more sensitive and adam has changed the riff styles somehwat.  danny has just kicked it up another notch somehow and justin really has come into his own.  my personal favorite songs so far are eonblue/the patient which i intuitively connect with at a deep level and parabol/parabola which is really an amazing exploration of pure emotion and joy of the body and being alive and is one of the most deeply romantic songs i've ever heard... this is a great one to put on your lover's mix (if you've such things!), probably good after sex when you are holding your loved one very close.  i mean, i think all of tool's music has great sexual energy, the only problem is sometimes you start listening to the music while you are banging!  haha.  it is also strange that parabol/parabola is probably the most accesible yet also most experimental of tool's songs.  it should be their next single i believe...  i will probably go through a period where each of the songs on the album is my favorite as my brain changes and eats up the input.  also as a note this is certainly an album that begs to be experimented with in psychedelic mindsets.  i'm off to watch the weather change my brothers and sisters.  love to you all!
B000059MEK|5.0|This is one of the best CD's I've ever heard, I heard a friends copy of this CD and liked this so much that I bought it as soon as I got the chance.  The sound clips hardly do this CD justice, pretty much all the songs are great to dance to and good to just listen to.<br />If you like techno at all then this is a CD that must be in your collection!
B0000399WI|5.0|It's not too often that a bunch of college students really like a movie like this one.  Well, we all do, that's most of the floor that I lived on (about 50 of us).  It's just a great movie.  That's really all I have to say.
B000003TBP|5.0|I remember back when the movie &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; first came out...then was re-released to theatres...but somehow I never got to go see it during those times. In the meantime, I kept hearing hype everywhere about how fantastic it was, how much people loved it, how hilarious it was and how much my friends all drooled with excitement over it. But when it finally got to home video and I *was* able to check it out, I just didn't find it funny or even vaguely interesting. Everything I had heard about it had simply raised my expectations SO high that letdown was inevitable. I'm afraid the same has happened here with Beck's &quot;Odelay&quot;.<br />I had heard whispers about this guy Beck and this album back around the time it was released, but never actually heard it. I simply never got around to it (partially because the album seemed so trendy at the time and partially because the cover was so blah and ugly...not that one should judge an album by its cover, but this cover was SO blah and ugly that it really turned me off). I finally heard Beck for the very first time when he released &quot;Midnite Vultures&quot;, and I fell in love with that album. With its great songs, groovy experimentation and quirky 70s bent, it became one of my favorites.<br />After getting &quot;Midnight Vultures&quot;, I then checked out &quot;Stereopathic Soul Manure&quot; and &quot;Mutations&quot;. The first one went back and forth from country experimentations to bizarre avante-garde grooves, and I loved that. The second went for a sort of Beatlesque folk approach, and I loved it as well. I was really getting into Beck now, and after discovering all this other material I expected &quot;Odelay&quot;--which was being raved about by both my friends and the press--to be a knockout.<br />Instead, &quot;Odelay&quot; turned out to be a collection of songs which were very well-done and clever but, oddly, as a whole were unsatisfying to me as an album. I had expected so much more from this recording by this point that... well, maybe letdown was inevitable.<br />Now don't get me wrong, I do love this album and think it's great. I really do. It's just that...well, it's hard to put a finger on...I guess the best way to put it is to say that each song on here is set at almost the exact same tempo. Not slow enough to be considered &quot;ballad&quot; speed but not fast enough to be considered danceable, it keeps its medium-paced mood throughout the entire recording.<br />Let me put it this way. The avant-garde band Mr. Bungle created music that deliberately shifted from slow to fast with each new passage and as a result persistently grabbed your attention. Beck does the exact opposite here on &quot;Odelay&quot;. I never before thought it was possible to take so many different styles of music and use the cut-and-splice asthetic to form them all into material that was so steadily paced.<br />As a result, there's plenty of variety in the musical styles but next to no variety in the timing. And after a while, the album starts to sound (dare I say it?) monotonous and boring. I haven't been able to get through a full listening of this entire disc without nodding out.<br />Now maybe I'm missing something here. Maybe Beck intended it to sound like one huge collage, maybe it's all supposed to sound like it's all one long track. But after the ultracool &quot;Midnite Vultures&quot; and other CDs I heard from him, I was really let down. This doesn't come across as being an &quot;album&quot; to me so much as an &quot;extended single&quot;.<br />I recall another reviewer here giving the disc one star and stating that the disc was boring. Maybe what I'm describing here was what that person was trying to get across--if you don't mind it all sounding the same rhythmwise, then sure, check it out. But if you want cool beats or wild experimentation, check out Beck's other material. This one actually comes across as sounding to my ears as the most commercial of all his discs I've heard so far.<br />I'm sorry, Beck. I still love your disc. But that's the reaction I got from it, I'm afraid.
0783225733|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time.  The DVD transfer is great.  There is an extensive and fascinating documentary with Ron Howard, Hanks, other actors and producers, even Jim and Marilyn Lovell!  Oh, and don't forget to look for the &quot;easter egg&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;hidden feature&quot;) on the disc.  When you go to the menu, the soundtrack of the movie will start and play each song, even the &quot;unreleased&quot; tracks that you can't buy in the store!  At first I thought that the menu would just play the main title theme over and over but if you keep listening, it goes from one track to the next.  Just hit the skip button on your DVD player. Awesome movie.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This movie is great and there are some similarities to BraveHeart, but they are not the same movie. <br />Gladiatior is a movie about Maximus a great general played by Russell Crowe. The ceasar is on his last legs and asks Maximus to become next in line, but when the Ceasar's son (Joaquin Phoenix) finds out he kills his father and becomes a Ceasar with which no one likes even his sister, whom he has a very strange relationship with. <br />The new Ceasar has Maximus' family hung and burned along with his plantation. He is then picked up and becomes a slave that has to fight for a sport and gain the respect of the crowd. <br />To avenge his family's death he becomes the best Gladiator of them all and being a General for the Roman Empire helps as well! They make it to Rome for a festival and he can reunite with his army and take Rome back. He gains the respect of the Ceasar, but little does the Ceasar know just who this Gladiator is! <br />Get this movie and find out what happens!
B00000JCB2|5.0|This is a great album, though its very different from Limp Bizkit's debut album, 3 Dollar Bill Y'all$. It lacks some of the adrenaline rush that 3DBY provided, but sounds much more orgainized and thought out. The best songs are Break Stuff, Nookie, I'm Broke, 9 Teen 10 Nine, Trust?, and Nobody Like You. I would definately reccomend this CD even if ur not an LB fan.
B000056K04|2.0|When I first got it, I was excited about what it might contain, because I loved \\"I Did It\\" and \\"The Space Between\\". Unfortunately, those are the ONLY good songs on the CD. I guess I'm not supposed to say this, because I live in DMB's hometown of Charlottesville, VA. After listening to the first few tracks, I have only picked this album up a couple times, and that was to listen to \\"I Did It\\".
B00004XOWM|4.0|I don't really think that this album is nearly as bad as many people make it out to be. Here's a breakdown describing all the songs.<br />Hot Dog - this pretty much sets the mood for most of the cd. ...and full of 4-lettered words.<br />My Generation - sets up a you-versus-us atmosphere, but still a good song<br />Full Nelson - a somewhat heavier song than the other ones. its about ppl always picking on fred and how theyre gonna get knocked the ...out.<br />My Way - Good song, but freds still complaining about things<br />Rollin (Air Raid Vehicle) - A great song, but doesnt have much substance in the lyrics<br />Livin it Up - this isnt really worth making a song out of, but the music part of it is still good.<br />The One - a slower song, good that fred isnt complaining about something for a change.<br />Getcha Groove On - a decent rap song<br />Take a Look Around - the mi:2 theme. much better than the most of the rest of the album<br />It'll be OK - in my opinion, the best song on the album. finally, fred isnt complaining about the media<br />Boiler - one of the best songs on the album<br />Hold On - this song makes me very nervous about the future of Limp Bizkit. can anyone say n*sync?<br />Rollin' (Urban Assult Vehicle) - A decent song, but not as good at air raid vehicle<br />Overall, this is a decent album, but not up to the potential of Limp Bizkit
0679428887|5.0|I would just like to write a short review on Archangel as a consequence of being suprised by the average rating it has already recieved.  I thought the book to be excellent.  It was not of a genre I would have normally read, I, like many others have been previously put off books of a 'historical' nature, and attempted this book almost by accident.  Dont be put off, the book is a fantastic story and deserves better than the 3.5 rating it currently has.
B000001Y42|5.0|This is definately LB's best album (not that Signifigant Other wasn't great). It has a perfect mix of rap and rock, and really gets the adrenaline going. Production isnt nearly as good as the songs from Sig. Other or CSHFW, and it doesnt sound as orgainized, but that just adds the the overall fury of it all (not the production part, the unorgainized part :)  The best songs on this album are Stuck, Pollution, Counterfeit, Stalemate, and Clunk. This CD is definately worth buying.
B0000508U6|5.0|This is a great cd - every song is unique and beautiful. I fell in love with it the first time I listened to it, which was over a week ago and I havent stopped playing it yet. Its a great cd to play in the car while going on a relaxing drive - or as background music during a romantic evening at home.
078062565X|4.0|Before seeing this movie myself, I used to think that people who described King Kong as a Christ-figure were just trying to be outrageous.  Far from it!  They understood what the filmmakers meant, and the symbolism is hardly subtle.  Denham, the explorer who has brought King Kong to New York (after allowing the gorilla to trash a native village that had coexisted with him just fine up until then) gloats that &quot;In his native land, he was a king!  A GOD!  But we bring him to you as a captive!&quot;  And the curtain parts to show King Kong chained to a crucifix-shaped scaffolding. You'd have to be rather dense not to recall that the same thing happened to someone else's God, too.  But what really raises this movie above the level of mere action-adventure is the expressions on the creature's face, especially in the final, famous Empire State Building sequence: anger, pain, tenderness, sorrow -- he's much more &quot;human&quot; than the macho idiots who captured him.  The only other movie creature with such a wonderfully expressive face that I've ever seen was Steven Spielberg's E.T.  <br />One might also point out that King Kong goes on his final rampage in New York not to save himself, but to rescue his beloved Fay Wray when he thinks she's being attacked.  Denham, looking utterly unrepentant for all the trouble that he's caused, says at the end, &quot;It was Beauty killed the Beast,&quot; but like Adam, when he said &quot;The woman tempted me!&quot; he's passing the buck.
B00005A1PR|5.0|I'm not going to mince words.  Buy this album if you have not, put it in your player and press play. Then hit repeat entire CD, sit back shut up and listen.  Don't talk.  Listen.  Then listen again and again.  You will want to thank me, but don't,  just listen.  LISTEN I tell you!!  It's fantastic!
B00004TH7Z|5.0|Iron Maiden is one of the best heavy metal groups ever. And they have always kept their style. This album is a sample that the heavy metal (New Wave of British Heavy Metal - like) is still alive and will live forever.
0812589041|5.0|Ender's game is about a &quot;third&quot;, a child born beyond the legal two.  He, as well as his brother and sister have been conditioned to be the perfect soldiers for an upcoming war.  I have read this, as well as the books succeeding this, and i still find myself coming back to this great story, to read it again, and share in Ender's adventure.  This book is the written wonderfully, and is the very entertaining as well.  I started reading the book late one night for the first time, and it was so exhilerating, i finished it that night, I hardly slept.  I am a great lover of science fiction, and this book has it all.  Space fighting, zero gravity battlefields, and an alien enemy.  I strongly encourage you to read this book, and be prepared to read the entire book in one night!:-)  Orson Scott Card can creat such a vivid scene in your head, that you feel as if you are there.  You cannot wait to look around the next corner, and share in Ender's hardships, and in his victories.  When he wins, you feel a sense of pride, and when he loses, defeat.  But don't worry, There are far more victories than defeats!!!!   This book you can ginve to anyone.  Even a someone with a dislike for science ficion would love it, i'm sure.  That is how well it is written.  If you buy this book you wil not regret it.  It has been my favorite book for years now, and i see it as mine for more to come.
0811826848|5.0|For those of us in the world who have been touched by the Beatles and their music, for those of us who have ever been curious about the Beatles and their music, and even those of us who don't even like the Beatles, this is the book to buy. <br />               &quot;The Beatles Anthology&quot; provides an inspirational,  coming-of-age story of the greatest and most influential band of our time. You hear from all of the Beatles themselves: their opinions, their childhood stories, and their own personal description of life as pop icons.<br />          Bottom Line: Throw away all your old Beatle biographies and usher in the new biography by the Beatles themselves!
B00000ILBK|5.0|Imagine a world in which there had never been a Star Trek.  Now, that being done, imagine *this* film being released in the theatres.  This is absolutely one of the *best* science fiction scripts in ages!  An intriguing story...gradual layers of revelation about what is *really* going on...a superb combination of characters (which is partly what has always made Star Trek a good thing).  Dare I say it's, by far, the most *adult* Star Trek film in the whole series?  The emphasis is on the story, not the action.  The pacing and development of character relationships are nearly flawless.  It's a film with real depth, content, and integrity. Great space opera can, indeed, make a great science fiction movie (and several earlier Trek outings do this well).  But *this* film has gone...well...where none of them have gone before!  Approach it on this level and you will *not* be disappointed.
0553213105|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is such a wonderful book.  It should be, considering it has been a classic for so many years--it was written in 1813!  But some people are pushed away by classics for just being &quot;classics&quot;--don't be pushed away from this!  I'll be honest, I first discovered this story on &quot;Wishbone.&quot;  It was my favorite episode.  I decided to read it after finishing &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; and aching for another great book.  This is it!  It has wonderful characters that you fall in love with, a wonderful love story, and insights that really make you think about . . . pride and prejudice of all things.  It's wonderfully written, and it's fun to try to get used to the different usage of English.  Read it!
B00005KARK|5.0|Dumbo is a cinematic milestone and masterpiece of family entertainment.  The storyline and characters are well rounded enough (just) to entertain adults and older children and the quality of the animation both holds children's attention and enables them to empathise with the principle characters.  In addition, the moral of the story is well presented without being clumsily overstated as in much modern animation.<br />Both my children have frequently watched this DVD (which first came out (without extras) in Europe in 1999) since they were one and both enjoy it imensely.<br />I'm both astonished and disturbed that anyone could deem this movie unsuitable for children but can only assume they come from the same group of people who banned Robin Hood books from schools for being 'pro communist' and Shakespeare for being 'too explicit'!<br />The 'drunken scene' is funny, brief and discrete (all you see is the shadows of characters through canvas).  As to fast forwarding through the dream sequence for the kids' benefit because it is 'too long' that is verging on irresponsible.  All doing so teaches a child is that it's OK to have a short attention span and to zoom through films to the 'interesting bits'.  Perhaps I was wrong though and the moral of the story has been hidden too deeply &quot;Persevere - Don't Give Up&quot; is lost on some people.
6305841861|5.0|Warning: some spoilers.<br />The first Evil Dead movie was awesome but this sequel blows it away. While it isn't really a sequel (it's more like a remake), it's still great and given the choice I'd much rather watch Evil Dead 2 than Evil Dead 1. It's very fast-paced and is much more enjoyable and more fun than ED 1, perfectly mixes Horror and Comedy, and Bruce Campbell is the best! For the story of Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn, it's a little tough to explain because ED 2 virtually has no plot, but I'll sum it up like this: Ash along with his girlfriend Linda take a vacation at some cabin where Ash discovers a tape recorder and a weird book called the Necronomicon (a book made of Human flesh and inked in Human blood that contains spells on how to resurrect Demons and the like). He plays the tape which summons Monsters and Demons from the forest that wreak havoc and try to either possess or kill Ash. The story is basically just a rehash of the first film (I've heard that director Sam Raimi had some trouble directly following the first film because of the new distributor, so he decided to remake the first. I'll let the story problem pass because of Sam's troubles), but ED 2 is still awesome! Bruce steals the show as Ash and he just rocks here! I loved the scene where he smashed a lot of plates against his Head, sawed off his possessed Hand, got showered with lots of differently-colored blood, and when he got his Chainsaw arm! How can you not love the scene where he saws off the Deadite's Head and blows it's Head off with his Boomstick Shotgun? His lines are also very funny and memorable and their so cool (Swallow This! Groovy! Let's Go Carve Ourselves A Witch!). I liked the other characters as well. I really liked Deadite Ash and Evil Ed and the whole Henrietta storyline was great and fit in very well. The special F/X were awesome and the gore was GREAT! The finale is very exciting and way tense and the Monster (supposedly that thing that we see from it's POV in the firstED movie and early on in Part 2) is finally revealed and is way cool and is definitely worth the wait. Sam Raimi's direction is very top-notch and the camera angles are very good and the film's Atmosphere is strong and the feel fast and furious. There are a ton of fun and memorable scenes and the whole movie just kicks butt from start to finish. WAY better than the first (which is still cool) and definitely better than Army Of Darkness. Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn is truly one of the best Horror Films ever made, and simply put, it's a must-see experience. The Special Edition DVD is excellent and simply makes the movie all the more fun. Nice extras include a really funny and enjoyable commentary by Sam Raimi as well as Bruce Campbell and the Co-Writer and one of the special F/X guys, a fantastic behind-the-scenes featurette which shows how a lot of the special effects were done and some funny outtakes and bloopers. You also get a very nice still gallery which has a ton of still photographs that are very clear and have great quality, and there are plenty more extras. And yes, the transfer is great. Evil Dead 2 has never looked and sounded better and it will probably never be better than it is here. Unfortunately I couldn't get the Limited Edition DVD like I wanted, but both DVDs seem to be the same (at least, judging from technical aspects I've read). <br />What are you waiting for? Buy the Special or Limited Edition DVD of this film and enjoy it and it's extras!!!!!
0201485672|5.0|There are dozens of books that will tell you how to write 'reuseable code'.  This is possibly the only book around that will tell you how to reuse code and how to modify it to your needs without breaking it.<br />Much of it is common sense (after you've had it pointed out to you) but there's still a wealth of ideas in it that are worth having around, if only so that you don't have to reinvent the wheel' again.<br />Personally, the most valuble knowledge I gained from the book was the relatively minor bit on unit testing.  The concept of writing and starting code tests before writing the code has rippled slowly through the way I work and enriched it enormously.  For me the book has been worth it on that front alone.<br />V.
B000002H33|3.0|While I genuinely regard this to be a fine album, I can't understand why the majority of people consider it to be both  Metallica's finest hour and a &quot;landmark&quot; thrash metal album.<br />Metallica have, in my opinion, released three albums which are better than &quot;Master Of Puppets&quot; : &quot;...And Justice For All&quot;; &quot;Metallica&quot; ( a.k.a &quot;The Black Album&quot; ); &quot;Load&quot;. These three albums are more advanced in every musical department, and offer more variety. As regards &quot;Master Of Puppets&quot; being a landmark album, I deem this to be untenable; the fact is, &quot;Megadeth&quot; released a finer album the same year as Puppets in the form of &quot;Peace Sells... But Who's Buying?&quot;. Indeed, not only is Megadeth's album better, it's far better! Really, &quot;Peace Sells&quot; offers more complex guitar playing, more insightful lyrics and, generally, more adequate songwriting. ( Well, comparisons are odious! )<br />In addition, a great number of people are not fully aware of how big a formulation Dave Mustaine ( Megadeth's leader ) was to Metallica until he was relentlessly ejected in 1982; in fact, Mustaine was responsible for some guitar riffs on the first three Metallica albums ( yes, that means this album! ) It's justified why Mustaine took so long to overcome his acrimony with his previous band, and especially as so many Metallica fans did not know this important fact of Mustaine contributing so much to Metallica's early albums.<br />Metallica are a great quartet, whose music flows better than almost any other band. I am a fan of Metallica, and already they have left a legacy of remarkable music. I just can't understand why so many people harp on about Puppets as their &quot;crowning glory&quot; when they have made stronger albums. My references to Megadeth is to refute statements of Puppets being the unsurpassed thrash album, not simply because I'm a biased Megadeth fan!
0140189378|3.0|Just kidding with my tittle.  I can't help but connect Robin Williams and co. jumping off of desks in Dead Poet's Society to the phrase Carpe Diem/ Seize The Day.  (I know, Saul Bellow wrote this book before Mr.Williams was even born!)<br />I thought this book had a great start.  I loved the characterizations in the first half, I felt I was really getting into it.  Sadly, by the second half, I found the book a bit tedious and unsatisfying.  The doctor character was just plain annoying, and although that very well may have been the point, it was irritating reading about him.
6305011575|5.0|This has to be one of, if not, my favorite movie! Tim curry was wonderful as Pennywise and this movie freaked me out when I first saw it and it still does today. Well, I know that I'm definitely going to buy this on DVD when it comes out. In the meantime, I'll read the book... I heard there's some great parts that they took out in the movie! WONDERFUL movie and I recommendit highly..... be brave!
014028009X|3.0|I never thought I would promote a movie over a book... but I can't help it.  I read Bridget Jone's when it first came out, and found it fairly unthrilling.  There was so much hype surrounding its humor, and I couldn't wait to laugh out loud.  It struck me as man obsessed, and a bit dull.  The movie, however, I adored!  It was funny, and made Bridget seem more real and loveable.  I must add in that I think what the media did in regards to Renee Zewelleger's weight was absoulutely despicable. She wasn't fat at all!
B0000087QO|5.0|I was shocked that this album was not considered as an 'essential recording', since its one of the best records of the 70's. There is not a bad song on the album, great songwriting, you could listen to this album and think you are listening to a greatest hits package. At least half of the album could have made it to the top ten, but dont get me wrong, just listen to Debbie's vocals and you know this is no pop or disco music, she is getting her inspiration from a depper place. A classic.
1557280290|5.0|The other review summed up the plot already.  I just wanted to encourage others to read this book.  It will make you take a look at your own life in the end and evaluate where exactly it is headed.
B00005AAFS|2.0|I didn't like this one at all. Yes there are a few good songs but most of them I didn't like and compared to their previous albums (which I thought were great) doesn't stand up. Songs are built poorly, and the sound in the old ones was much better
0553106635|5.0|&quot;The Song of Ice and Fire&quot; is head and shoulders above the other two big fantasy series currently running. I've pretty much abandoned &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot; (repetitive, dull and boring) and &quot;The Sword of Truth&quot; (pointlessly meandering, deux ex machinas). &quot;SI&amp;F&quot; has strong, distinct characters and tightly crafted plotlines, and compelling prose. Things actually happens that change the makeup of the world in each book. Kudos to Mr. Martin.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|He can sing! He can sing! He can really sing, people! I bought this CD last week, late one night. When I got home, I wasn't even really able to listen to it because I had to pack for a trip. But now I'm back, I listen to it everyday and damn, can he sing! Ewan has the best voice. The accent helps also. Sometimes when the Elephant Love Medley or the Come What May plays, I take Nicole's place so I can sing along with Ew! Love the CD, I have to see the movie before I totally forget about (not likely to happen). And the songs... I love \\"Because We Can\\" You could really dance to it! Buy this CD! Don't wait for the movie. Buy this CD. It's totally awesome.
B00003CXRM|2.0|I can not believe you ranked this a 4 or so. Not only did it lack focus, It was not even that funny or creative. Too stupid to be good. Sorry but I don't agree this was a good movie!
B00003CXRP|4.0|I was not sceptical at all when going to see this at the cinema as I have not disliked any of Tom Hank's films.<br />The story, while a little over the top, is quite straight forward, Hanks plays a federal express chief, who, while eating christmas dinner, has a call and has to jet off with some federal express parcels. Leaving his fiance (Helen Hunt) and telling her he'll be right back!!! Indeed!! The jet crashes in some remote area killing the few on board with the exception of Hanks! I must say that the plane crash scene is one of the finest i've every seen in a movie!!<br />Hanks, on a small life boat finds himself washed up on the shore of some island along with the dead remaining crew!! Hanks soon realises that there is no life on the island and not much food, he does make use of the washed up federal packages, not least making a 4 year friend with a volley ball named Wilson!! And so begins a fight for survival where he learns to catch fish make fires and even get a septic tooth out!!<br />Hank's performance definatley keeps the film going, and while there is hardly any musical score in the film its still entertaining stuff throughout. You can actually see in his face the will to survive, kept going by a pocket sized picture of his girl!! Another good aspect, is the impressive amount of weight that Hanks lost for the second part of the film - after being there for 4 years!!<br /><br />Its this mix of drama with the action and aventure of the first part of the film that makes Cast Away a compelling watch!
6305807086|1.0|I like a lot of movies.  This movie was truly different.  Different is not always good.  I owned this movie for two days, then traded it at the used DVD shop for something better.  What a waste of John Cusak's talent.
0793518326|5.0|Like many other reviewers I started with the early version of &quot;Beatles Complete&quot;, in my case some 20 years ago. So many of these versions were not even in the right key! Any publication 1200 pages long will have errors but I've found nothing obvious yet. I have to disagree about &quot;no reply&quot;, this was not written in a minor key. This is a truly amazing feet of dedication that must rival a midday sprint through Death Valley! After years and years of trying to get close to the originals, someones unlocked the door. Whilst others have searched for complexity 4 Japenese guys have unearthed the simple genius of much of the Fab 4's music. Many moderate musicans will be amazed at what they can produce with these scores. If my house catches fire this book will be the fist thing I grab as I run out the door!
0446525537|4.0|First off, I want to say that I usually do not read books like this. However, I am trying to introduce my wife to the world of reading, and this is the book she wanted to read. She asked me to read it as well, so that we could discuss it afterwards.<br />I surely hope that Sparks was using this seventh grade writing style as a tool to convey the speech patterns of the narrator. Because, if this is truly his writing style, he is one sorry author. He uses the phrase &quot;If you know what I mean&quot; just about a million times. His prose literally rambles on like a middle school short story for a creative writing class.<br />However, in spite of the fact that this book is total slop, I liked it. I thought parts of were touching. Even if the plot was movie-of-the-week material. I can't help it. I must be just a big softy, because I got choked up several times.<br />The only downside to liking this book, for me, is that now my wife wants to read another Nicholas Sparks book. Oh well, the things we do for love.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|After seeing the movie twice within one week, I absolutely HAD to have the soundtrack. And although I must admit dissapointment at first that the songs on it do not mirror the ones in the movie, it did not take long for my addiction to this soundtrack to become almost overwhelming! Each song is unique and brilliantly put together. I can't get the songs out of my head (and for once I'm not complaining about that!) To anyone expecting the exact same songs from the movie, please remember this is Baz Luhrman AND a movie saturated with music. I need only remind you of the soundtracks for &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; and Luhrman's &quot;Romeo and Juliet.&quot; Both came in two volumes. Both volumes were fantastic. So enjoy what you can, and wait eagerly for the next volume of &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; to be released. I know I am.
1563894696|5.0|The 80s were the times of the Bat. The revolution in the Batman comics, started in the mid-seventies by people like Dennis O'neil and Neal Adams, reached its peak in the eighties, with the works of such brilliant writers as Mike W. Barr, Alan Moore, Grant Morrison and, obviously, Frank Miller. Tim Burton's Batman, possibly the finest comics-based feature film, was also made at that time. The nineties weren't as favorable to the Dark Knight. The artistic barrier was broken, and the spirit of revolution that characterized 80s comics drifted away. With Neil Gaiman and others of his kind becoming the main power in adult comics, Batman was, once again, mainstream. Although some good stories were published, none had the impact and inventiveness of Frank Miller's Batman.<br />Which is why I was very pleasently surprised to read the Long Halloween, a collected mini-series originally published in 1996, which is probably the finest Batman story released since Grant Morrison's masterpiece 'Arkham Asylum: Serious House on Serious Earth' in 1989. It was the first work I've ever read of either writer Jeph Loeb or artist Tim Sale. Loeb's dialogue is extremely powerful, flawless, reminding me of Frank Miller's writing on 'Dark Knight Returns' or 'Ronin'. Sale's wonderful artwork and brilliant use of close-ups, color and page compositions brought back memories of Dave Gibbons' work on 'Watchmen'.<br />The storyline was the best I've seen in years, recreating the story of Harvey Dent, aka Two-Face - in my mind, the most interesting of Batman's many enemies. It's a detective story, very different from the action-packed style of most 90s Batman, with the beautifuly created atmosphere of a film-noir. A family of gangsters and a serial killer are the actual 'villains' in the Long Halloween, but the main idea - the main conflict in the story - is the friendship of Batman, Harvey Dent and Comm. Gordon, and the old question of law and justice; some of Batman's more standart Arkham Asylum residing foes are brought in for short appearences, not stealing the show but giving this extremely long story some energy. Dent's personality is crafted brilliantly, as is the relationship between the three law enforcers, and the story of Dent's fall into crime is more tragic and touching than ever. The Long Halloween is one for the ages.
0792842073|5.0|Can you imagine a non-documentary film that discusses every possible angle of a highly-charged subject such as the death penalty but does NOT take a side?  That is precisely what Tim Robbins has done with Dead Man Walking.  The characters are exceptionally believable and do perfect justice to the different feelings we all have on the subject of capital punishment.<br />At the end of the film you truly don't know which side the director is on.  And in the end, we see flashes of the murder victims and the executed criminal, three dead human beings, and we can say either, &quot;good, the SOB got what he deserved&quot; or &quot;now we have three dead people instead of two, and the victims are still just as dead.&quot;<br />I would encourage everyone, regardless of their opinion about the death penalty, to watch this film.  If at the end, your position is as firm as ever, that's great; if you change your mind or at least rethink your position, that's great too, but either way your opinion is informed rather than based solely on emotion.
B00004W56S|5.0|Smallcreep's Day is a great album.  Great because of it's moving, epic vision and power.  It's the sort of album that takes you on a journey every time you listen to it and amazes you with it's originality and the strength of it's melodies.  Smallcreep's Day is based on a book of the same name about a guy who dares to leave his assigned place inside a factory where he lives and explore the rest of his world.  Of course this would be impossible to know if you don't have the LP, because none of the liner notes are reproduced on this edition.  Neither are the lyrics which is a shame because not only are they meaningful and poetic but some of them are difficult to understand through the music.  The vocals, however, are excellent just the same - the singer is perfectly suited to the music. <br />Anyone who likes Genesis (pre-1983 especially) should like this album.  It has the same sort of feeling as on their best work.  I suppose the closest comparison I can make is to Duke, although Smallcreep's Day has it's own thing going.  If you're seriously into Genesis, this is a must own.  If you're just looking for more progressive rock to listen to, it's a must own also.  Come to think of it, anyone who likes good music in general should buy it.  The only person I can think of who shouldn't would be someone who thinks Invisible Touch was the be all and end all.  And in that case, you should be forced to listen to it anyway.
B00000DGUG|5.0|Alanis Morissette is, without doubt, a legitimate phenomenon. Not only did she record one of the most successful and talked about albums of the 90's, she managed to defy her critics, disappear for a year to work with Mother Theresa, and then release an even better second album. The maturity she obviously gained in her absence is evident in every song on Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie. Gone are the amateur-psychologist introspective lyrics and the catchy yet unemotional music - don't get me wrong, I loved `Jagged Little Pill', but compared to this, it's chart fodder - and in their places are lyrics with real depth of understanding and music with real emotion and sensitivity. There is a darkness about this album, a forthright intelligence, subtle wit and heaps of individuality - which means that, unfortunately, it does not have widespread commercial appeal.<br />Musically, it's heavier and more diverse than the previous album. Some of the tracks sound like moody heavy rock (Baba, Joining You, I Was Hoping), others like cherubic folk tunes, but then it never sounds like anything else you've ever heard - her voice is utterly unique. A lot of the tracks require a great deal of digestion, and some I've listened to for a good couple of years and still haven't worked out. Songs like One, Would Not Come and I Was Hoping are incredibly self-critical, but only if you're really insecure can you relate to the lyrics. Joining You is a very personal number (it could have been written about my teens) that really situates you inside her life, and That I Would Be Good is incredible, by far the most insightful and moving she has ever been - provided you can understand how it feels to pin your happiness and self-esteem upon success. Can't Not makes you think, The Couch is a remarkably deep psychology-fest, and there are still songs about love and the pressures of relationships in these modern times.<br />Overall, Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie is great, but like I said, I don't think it has widespread appeal because it is not all happy and empowering, her sexual aggression (a major part of the first album) is very underplayed, and the songs can make you feel uncomfortable about your own life. The eastern influences are very noticeable and enhance her rare sound. The only downside is Unsent, which I cannot relate to at all. Personally, I think this album belongs in every collection, but even my girlfriend - who loved the first album - hates this one. I won't say you have to go out and buy it, but I definitely think more people, especially those who hated the first album and anyone into alternative music, should give it an open listen. Then you might just change your opinion about her.think it has widespread appeal because it is not all happy and empowering, her sexual aggression (a major part of the first album) is very underplayed, and the songs can make you feel uncomfortable about your own life.

6305878323|5.0|Julie Andrews won the 1965 Academy Award for Best Actress in this delighful musical adaptation of the popular British children's books. And deservedly so. From the moment she descends from the sky as Poppins and lands on the front steps of Jane and Michael Bank's home, there's absolutely no stopping her. Here, as in the many films she would make over the next five decades, Andrews graps hold of a part, takes it that extra mile and never once disappoints.  As Poppins, she is magnificent. But there's more to the part than just singing about tea parties on the ceiling, popping in and out of chalk pavement pictures or spoonfuls of sugar. Sure, she's the nanny we'd all love to have. But in the story, her character arrives just in the knick of time to put a dysfunctional family back together in true Disney fashion. The songs are great. In particular, &quot;Chim-Chim Cheree,&quot; &quot;Spoonful of Sugar,&quot; &quot;I Love to Laugh&quot; and &quot;Supercalifragilisticexpalidocious.&quot; The rest of the cast, Dick Van Dyke, Karen Dotrice, Glynis Johns, David Tomlinson, Matthew Garber and Ed Wynn, also add to the fun. Hard to believe that it's been 37 years since this film was first released. Nontheless, it's just as entertaining as it was way back when. It's also fun to sit back and watch a whole new generation of kids and their parents discover the magic and wonder of this terrific Disney film. Rent it today. Or Buy it. You won't be disappointed.
B00001U0E1|5.0|What do you call this type of film?  A historical romantic comedy?  It doesn't really matter.  Shakespeare aside, the strength of the film is its great story and its strong character development.  The supporting cast with Geoffry Rush as Henslowe, Judi Dench as Queen Elizabeth, Ben Affleck as Ned Alleyn, and Tom Wilkinson as Hugh Fennyman make their characters memorable, even with, in some cases, small roles.  As good as the film is by itself, it becomes more interesting if you know your Shakespeare and Renaissance history.  There are tons of small references.  John Webster is a playwrite working a little after Shakespeare who makes an appearance in the film (hint: rats).  Christopher Marlowe, a contemporary of Shakespeare, is a minor character.  And there are numerous references to various Shakespeare plays.   Finally, in rating the replay value of this film, given its genre, humor, and level of subtlety, I think it is worth watching many times.
B00004Z4WQ|1.0|I can sit through most movies I rent and even if I don't really care for them, I still think of them as ok.  But I really didn't like this movie at all.  I wanted to stop watching it about 1/4 of the way through.   The only reason I didn't stop watching it was because from the previews it looked like something I would really like.  I thought it was tasteless, disgusting and plain old stupid.   Maybe some people like this type of movie, but I definitely don't.  It's not often that I get fooled by previews of a movie.   This time I did.   I had to give it one star because that was the minimum.  I would give it zero if I could.
0064407667|1.0|I'm very glad that I borrowed the book from the library and didn't waste money on it.  In short, this book was simply astounding. What a weak plot.  It's fine when Count Olaf threatens to kill Sunny if Violet won't marry him.  But it's a little ridiculous when she somehow misses the fact that (a paragraph later) the Count tells her that he will kill both Sunny AND her brother anyway after they're married.  And she just ignores this? Anyway, I'll skip the other obvious weak points in the plotline, and move on to what truely bothered me about this book.<br />HOW MANY TIMES MUST AN AUTHOR INSULT HIS READERS BY FEELING COMPELLED TO DEFINE _VERY_ SIMPLE WORDS, LIKE &quot;RICKETY&quot; or &quot;SIMMER&quot;?  The book is recommended for grades 5 and up, and, quite frankly, the 5th graders I know, know these words.<br />If there's a word in a book that I don't know the definition of, I will look it up myself.  Honestly, it seems like every other page, the author is defining simple words, somethimes even going to great lengths to provide examples (like his LONG explanation of the words figurative and literal.) What's even worse, is that there are a few instances where the author (after presuming that his readers don't know the meanings of small words) misuses others, like &quot;invented&quot;.  I'm sorry, but Violet did NOT invent the grappling hook, she merely made one. This was a very low-level book, and I certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone who has a decent vocabulary and a liking for decent plotlines.<br />Shun this piece, which here means &quot;to steer clear of this poorly written book.&quot;

B0000013GT|5.0|After SouthernPlayalisticadillacmusik comes Atliens.  The feel of this album is totally different than their debut.  A change for the better well u will have to decide that.  This is more than worthy follow up to their debut. But since I love the first one i cant really say this is the best one.  But it may be a better album.  This one is filled with content and most people will probably hate on the first few listens.  Once you grasp the feel of the album it is definitely likable though.  THe almost freestyle session of Two Dope Boys slapped people in the face jsut like Aint No Thang did.  Atliens sports one of their tightest choruses:  &quot;Throw yo hands in the aya and wave em like just dont caya, and if you like fish and grits and all the pimp .... everybody lemme hear ya say oh yaya&quot; These two songs provide immediate satsifaction.  Jazzy Belle's soundscape makes this the best song on the album hands down.  They drop some serious knowledg on this song also.  Millenium drops a classic um um um um chorus and hits well.  Elevators Me and You is another classic joints.  Chorus once again is too tight and the remix is welcomed also.  Other songs take some getting used to like Wheels of Steel, Wailin, , Mainstream and 13th floor.  But there is not a single bad song on the album so by all means spend ya 18 dollas on this and enjoy.
B0000027RL|5.0|This is still one of Pearl Jam's best albums and features some of their best and most classic of songs, such as, &quot;Jeremy,&quot; &quot;Evenflow,&quot; &quot;Alive,&quot; etc.  All the songs are powerful, intelligently written, and are just awesome.  This album rocks not only musically, by lyrically.  A must-have for Pearl Jam fans.
B000002BUY|4.0|Incubus really is a good band, and science is really a good cd. Nothing more.
B000002U9Y|3.0|Pink Floyd's second album, A Saucerful Of Secrets, suffers for the absence of the band's founder, Syd Barrett.  Because of his abuse of psychedelic drugs and his decent into madness, Mr. Barrett appears on only one song, the album's closer &quot;Jugband Blues&quot;.  In his absence, Roger Waters assumed control of the band and David Gilmour was added to take over the guitar duties.  The album shows flashes of brilliance like the cosmic &quot;Set The Controls For The Heart Of The sun&quot;, but Mr. Waters was still learning to master his sound and vision.  Whereas Mr. Barrett could write a short and concise song like &quot;See Emily Play&quot;, Mr. Waters is too expansive with the songs.  This album is more of a learning experience for the group without their leader and as they would show on later efforts, they graduated to great things.
0800179501|3.0|I bought this DVD a year ago...  Movie itself is awesome. But I was disappointed it was regular 4:3 screen format... Then I heard that &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; will be released AGAIN along with &quot;II&quot; and &quot;III&quot;.  I was really exciting, but only the first movie will be released in &quot;4:3&quot; again???  I don't get it....... &quot;II&quot; and &quot;III&quot; are &quot;Wide Screen&quot;, but why the first one is still &quot;4:3&quot; format?????  I know a lot of people is waiting &quot;Wide Screen&quot; Edition of &quot;The Karate Kid&quot;.  Come on!  It MUST be a &quot;Wide Screen&quot;!!!!!!!!!
B000050IMG|1.0|I like movies that spoof others as much as the next girl... or even just dumb humor.. Otherwise i wouldn't have watched SNL for so many years and Airplane, Fletch, Naked Gun, There's something about Mary..<br />But, this movie was not funny except for maybe the quick cameo and the guy who was gay and trying (sort of) to act like he wasn't..<br />Everything else.. the excessive farting stuff the bats in the underwear, blah blah blah.. bored me.. I started cleaning my room halfway through. Not for me.
B00000IPAX|2.0|What the hell happened to Blink? They used to make heavier music on Dude Ranch; now they are always singing the same pop \\"melodies\\" over and over. The only other good song other than any of their singles is \\"Anthem\\". It's pretty cool as far as the guitar.<br />Also, as far as the rest of this album, \\"Dumpweed\\" is very boring. It has NO originality. If you want to be like a juvenile \\"Stunt\\" by BNL, don't try to rip off other artists. This is punk? Maybe I don't like MTV punk, but other punk's okay. \\"Don't Leave Me\\" sounds just like \\"Wendy Clear\\". Songs like \\"Mutt\\" and \\"Going Away To College\\" are so forgetful, I don't even remember them anymore. And I still have it in my house, heard it this morning when my brother played it. \\"Party Song\\" is good if you like annoying music. Or boring. But if you like the upbeat rap-rock music, this song will be just fine. <br />\\"What's My Age Again?\\", \\"All The Small Things\\", \\"Anthem\\", and \\"Adam's Song\\" are the only good songs here.<br />I used to think punk can be like Green Day (Okay, I confess, they sound a bit alike), The Living End (new band), and Nirvana. I guess I was wrong....
078401213X|5.0|I recently saw Pi because my friend had a poster of the movie and it looked pretty interesting.  I really liked the movie and it was a really neat idea portrayed in a different way.  I also looked at some of the other reviews, and the movie wasnt boring or anything.  I am 16, and bored with a lot of movies, but I was never bored with this one.  Others have said it is a poor movie because of the script and director, but the director and a lot of the cast went to Harvard.  Dont listen to the bad reviews and if the movie sounds interesting to you I would reccommend seeing it.
B000002UA0|5.0|In the early days of Pink Floyd, the band's identity was formed by its eccentric guitarist and lead singer Syd Barrett.  The band's debut album, The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn is his masterpiece and it is a peak inside his crazed genius.  The album is a psychedelic oeuvre of spacey sounds and bizarre lyrics.  From the echo drenched &quot;Astronomy Domine&quot; to the trippy &quot;Bike&quot;, Floyd takes on a mystical musical journey.  They can easily alternate between an uptempo song like &quot;Lucifer Sam&quot; or slow things down in the dirge like &quot;Matilda Mother&quot;.  &quot;Flaming&quot; has some truly weird lyrics.  &quot;Take Up Thy Stethoscope &amp; Walk&quot; is a Roger Waters' song and lays the blueprint for his future work.  &quot;Interstellar Overdrive&quot; is a lengthy instrumental that would set the tone for much of Floyd's early work.  The song is a magnificent combination of sounds and has that cosmic, swirling sound that the band would perfect.  &quot;The Gnome&quot; is a fun song that typifies Syd Barrett as he was gnome-like himself.  Sadly, The Piper At The Gate Of Dawn would the only full album Syd Barrett would record with the band he formed.  But on this one disk, we get a small glimpse of his immense potential.
B000059HAI|5.0|...rest assured that this 30 year old classic TORA! TORA! TORA! will not disappoint. This is a carefully researched, historically accurate, well acted, thoughtful movie. In other words it appropriately honors the event and treats it with respect. The movie provides sufficient background and builds up to the actual attack. The development of the plan is shown to be the work of some brilliant stategists and is a result of Japan's appreciation for the capabilities of naval air power. The diplomatic and intelligence activities that factored so significantly in the outcome are given due consideration. <br />The movie does not tackle any of the controversies that have swirled around the event, almost since the day after. The elements that are key ingedients of the conspiracy theories such as intelligence information, aircraft dispersal at Wheeler field, the radar installation and decisions of commanders such as Admiral Kimmel and Gen. Walter Short are shown in a dispassionate and objective light. As a result, coincidence, oversight, and simple error are shown to be at fault, and more importantly, shown to be more believable than the alternative - a vast conspiracy of falsehoods and willingness to sacrifice men in order to get us into the war. <br />The action scenes showing the attack on Pearl are well done and are preceeded by a good build up of the suspense. The limited special effects capabilities of the time takes nothing away from the enjoyment of the action. No whizz-bang special effects are needed. The movie concludes with Adm. Yamamoto realizing that by failing to sink the American aircraft carriers this was a pyrrhic victory. He acknowledges as much with his famous quote: &quot;We have aroused a sleeping giant and filled him with a terrible resolve.&quot; Good acting by So Yamamura as Adm. Yamamoto, Joseph Cotten as Secretary of War Henry Stimson, Martin Balsam as Adm. Kimmel, Ejiro Tono as Adm. Nagumo and Takahiro Tamura as Lt. Commander Fuchida
B00005KFUM|5.0|i agree with the previous reviewer, this album could be considered as significant in contemporary music as \\"a night at the opera\\" was 25 years ago. \\"origin of symmetry\\" even has something in common with queen's works. it has not yet been released in the states, so if you're looking for more meaningful reviews (in real english, which i unfortunately don't have), check out amazon.co.uk . <br />all the tracks are brilliant! my favorites are: bliss, newborn, micro cuts, screenager, megalomania (with a real organ!) and the wonderful cover version of feeling good.<br />i must say that i listen to lots of very different music styles, including not only alt rock and indie, but also classical music, avant-garde jazz, and so on. and... \\"origin of symmetry\\" is definitely one of the best albums i have.<br />there were a lot of strange reviews to their previous album \\"showbiz\\" - weird comparisons and stuff like that. i think, the world (and, especially, the world of journalists) just wasn't ready for such a great band to come. it takes a snob to deny the grace of this band's music.<br />unlike most of other talented rock musicians, muse are REAL PROFESSIONAL musicians - just listen to their music paying attention to arrangements and separating instruments , you won't find quality of performance as high as this on any rock album.<br />the melodies themselves, vocal, drums, guitars -  everything is cool here!<br />i hope, muse will finally get what they deserve, as this group is simply much better than all the [stuff] we here on the radio all around the world.<br />BUY IT!
B0000027RL|4.0|For some reason, Pearl Jam seem to be one of the most influential bands. This is pretty memorable. Ten was a good alt-rock album which had different-paced songs, ranging from punk to blues-rock. Overall, this is a must. The only one I disliked was the single &quot;Alive&quot; since it was kinda flat. I'm writing this now in case I miss out on August 27, the *ten*-year anniversary for this album. Another thing that's funny is the remaining *ten* songs on here are pretty cool and solid. Not bad.
0440219078|1.0|this was such a boring book! I had to read it for school, and i kept falling asleep! it is confusing and has a very wierd plot. An old man passing on memories by touching someone? give me a break! dont read this book!
B00005LB9O|5.0|Believe me, I know that Travis can rock with the best of them. But like a reviewer before me, they choose not to on this album. Is this a bad thing? Let me tell you, if Travis can make five more albums that are as mellow and with this quality of music of &quot;Invisible band&quot;, then I will buy every last one of them. Why? Because you can rock with whatever bands you want to, but this band is more about rocking and thrashing guitars, they are about making music that is purely good and emotional. They did it on The Man Who, and they continue with The Invisible band. In the future if they decide to rock, I will still buy their CD's. Right now, though, be with the moment, enjoy the mellowness, and remember that this band is more talented than most bands in America and in UK (including similar sounding bands like Cold Play, Doves, and should I dare to say, Radiohead, who are still awesome). Every single song is good on the album, but some are the major highlights. &quot;Side&quot; is probably the best song I have ever heard from Travis, and this is saying something. &quot;The Cage&quot;, &quot;Flowers in the Window&quot;,&quot;Humpty Dumpty&quot;, &quot;Follow the light&quot;, and &quot;Indefinitely&quot; rank close to Side. &quot;Pipe dreams&quot; is a beatlesque tune that just screams music. As a matter of fact, the only songs that I don't listen to over and over are Dear Diary and Safe. All others are just amazing as well.  Just listen to the music, don't wish thrashing guitars or something more rocking. Be with Travis, who right now represent quality, heartfelt music that many bands can't seem to find right now.
B00005ATQI|5.0|Film is a seperate medium and you should never attempt to directly copy the original written work. The book will always be better, because ones imagination personnalizes the experience. <br />This film is top notch and Nicholson is flawless. Young Danny Lloyd is also superb. I read a review where they thought the kid was a downer. Since Danny is privy, from the opening, that evil exists in the hotel, then I would expect him to be terrified and depressed throughout the film. I think it would not have worked for Danny to be a little giddy, when his world is crumbling down. Take a look at Danny's expresion when Scatman is killed and he's hiding in the kitchen cupboard. Priceless! Kudos to Kubrick and Danny Lloyd for playing it correctly throughout.<br />Another complaint was the pacing, as many thought that the film dragged. I can only assume that you've grown up with the modern blockbuster, action film. You have not acquired the patience for a film to develop tension and suspense. Oh well, there'll always be plenty of &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; type films to dull your mind with.<br />My favorite scene is still the one between Jack and Mr. Grady in the bathroom. The tension created is incredible and it's also the point where the audience sees the connection of Jack's character to the hotel.<br />It's a great film with a marvously tight script, superb direction, perfect pacing and terrific ending. My only minor complaint would be the awkward acting in some of the secondary scenes. Duvall could have been better and Scatman looked uncomfortable at times.<br />The new DVD remastered version is very good, with a great 5.1 surround mix. Turn it up!!
B000000H42|5.0|This has to be Satan's favorite band!  This also has to be his favorite album, and I'm sure that he's blasting it in the pits of hell even now!  This album is full of demons, devils, satanic pacts, and truly great metal!  From top to bottom this recording is full of outstanding music!  The highlights are &quot;A Dangerous Meeting,&quot; &quot;Desecration Of Souls,&quot; &quot;Night Of The Unborn,&quot; &quot;The Oath,&quot; &quot;Welcome Princess Of Hell,&quot; and &quot;Come To The Sabbath.&quot; With wickedly great vocals from King Diamond and outstanding play from Michael Denner (Lead Guitar), Hank Shermann (Lead Guitar), Timi G. Hansen (Bass) and Kim Ruzz (Drums), this piece of dark metal is classic!  This is certainly the best album ever produced by Mercyful Fate or King Diamond!  Buy &quot;Don't Break The Oath&quot; if you like great heavy metal, but keep your holy water near.
B000001ESP|5.0|Very Intelligent Album!! One of my favourites of all time!! I love &quot;Limelight&quot; and &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot;. Geddy Lee has the most unique voices I've ever heard. Alex Lifeson is super on guitar especially on&quot;Limelight&quot;. It's  powerful and energetic!! Good album to crank up on your stereo!!
0767819543|5.0|A STUNNING FILM ON ALL LEVELS! MONTENEGRO IS MAGNIFICENT AND SHOULD HAVE WON THE OSCAR!...Montenegro reminds me of a foreign Geraldine Page which is the highest compliment I could give an actress!
B00005BJ2O|4.0|My first review didn't quite do the soundtrack justice. I have listened to the whole thing several times, except for &quot;Children of the Revolution,&quot; &quot;Nature Boy,&quot; and &quot;Diamond Dogs,&quot; which I think were wastes of space. <br />The soundtrack is magical, and I look forward to the other CDs. I think they should have arranged the set by the order of songs in the movie, with Nature Boy first, the Can-Can, etc. etc. That would have been more sensible. <br />Roxanne gives me chills. Complainte de la Butte (when was this in the movie, praytell?) is an awesome song, tho I have no clue what it means. Elephant Love Medley, Sparkling Diamond, Lady Marmalade, Come What May, Your Song, and Hindi Sad Diamonds are my other favorite tracks. I'm eagerly awaiting the next CDs.
B000002J09|5.0|In 1971, a band that was reasonably well-known by this time, Led Zeppelin, put out a mysterious release. There was no mention of the band, an album title or a track listing anywhere on the album. However, the music contained within this album was so revolutionary that, as a 13-year-old boy, I began listening to some of their music in 2001 and truly love all the songs on this album. This was the album that put them over the top, as, out of its eight songs, FIVE are now considered rock standards, including the anthemic and legendary &quot;Rock and Roll&quot; and even more legendary (and anthemic) &quot;Stairway to Heaven.&quot;<br />Up until this point, Led Zeppelin had been a headbanging blues-rock band and then showed some acoustic prowess on &quot;Led Zeppelin III.&quot; However, this is it: The album that has the best of everything they've tried. The thing that makes them the best metal band of the '70s is what Black Sabbath, Deep Purple and the like never figured out: That Led Zeppelin didn't just want to write music for you to bang your head to, they sometimes wanted to write music for you to swing your hips to as well...or just be put in awe by the sheer beauty of some of their performances.<br />Both sides are set up the same way: Two rockers, an acoustic track, followed by a Zepic. The first half has to be one of the best album halves in rock and roll history. From &quot;Black Dog&quot; and &quot;Rock and Roll,&quot; which both rock but in totally different and unique ways, to the acoustic duo that ends this set, &quot;The Battle of Evermore&quot; (with its Tolkien references and a beautiful Sandy Denny on vocals) and of course &quot;Stairway to Heaven,&quot; where everything about the song is perfect. &quot;Stairway&quot; does still suffer from mass classic rock radio overplay, but because I'm only newly into Zep, I can still appreciate this song for what it's really worth. Jimmy Page has never been able to recreate the magic of the guitar solo to this songon stage.<br />The second half begins with three of the lesser known songs from this album. The first two are &quot;Misty Mountain Hop&quot; and &quot;Four Sticks.&quot; They are both extremely enjoyable songs, especially the first one. In &quot;Four Sticks,&quot; John Bonham really does play with....two sticks...no, four. Then comes the beautiful acoustic ballad &quot;Going To California.&quot; However, the album closes with my favorite Zep track. (It's not &quot;Stairway.&quot;) It is &quot;When The Levee Breaks,&quot; which is probably the heaviest track in Led Zeppelin's repertoire. Robert Plant brings his harmonica out of retirement to complement the infectious drumbeat. Even though there are borrowed lyrics on this song, you get the sense that the band really had fun recording this. And, that's what made Led Zeppelin good also: They are a perfect balance between serious (&quot;Stairway to Heaven,&quot; &quot;Going to California&quot; and, to an extent, &quot;Battle of Evermore&quot;) and also sheer playfulness (&quot;Misty Mountain Hop&quot;, &quot;Black Dog&quot;, and &quot;When The Levee Breaks&quot; especially come to mind.)<br />A genre-revolutionizing album that is a must-own. Led Zeppelin would never reach this height again, although Houses of the Holy is darn close, as is Led Zeppelin I, which are my recommended buys if you buy this and like it.
B000002H2H|5.0|Metallica recorded good music both before and after &quot;Ride The Lightning,&quot; but this is their best album!  This outstanding collection of metal greatness is highlighted by the classic songs &quot;Fight Fire With Fire,&quot; &quot;For Whom The Bell Tolls,&quot; &quot;Fade To Black,&quot; and &quot;Creeping Death.&quot;  It was here that Cliff Burton (RIP You're Missed), James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich, and Kirk Hammett perfected the classic Metallica sound, and set in motion the band's unstoppable march to legendary status.  &quot;Ride The Lightning&quot; is easily one of the best heavy metal albums ever recorded!
0823003035|5.0|As a practicing artist I have to say that this is the finest book of its kind I've come across. If you are serious about taking a traditional approach to figure drawing and want to produce artwork of the finest quality, this is the book to look at. If you just want to learn to do quick sketches then you might look elsewhere, since the approach discussed is time-consuming and painstaking. But it is THE way to go if you are serious about fine art. If I was only allowed to have one book on my shelf this would be it.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|The movie Moulin Rouge looked interesting before it came out.  The first time I went to see it I was both confused and spellbound.  Then I couldn't get the music out of my head, I bought the soundtrack and found only half of the songs from the movie were on it. I was hooked.  Since June 1st I have revisited various theatres to see the movie 5 times.  I never see movies twice none the less 5 times.  This movie is so entertaining I've taken both my little brother, sister, and half of my friends to enjoy this SPECTACULAR, SPECTACULAR with me.  For anyone who enjoys freedom, beauty, truth, and love, and midgets in tutus- this movie is for you.
B00002RASO|4.0|Even though I gave this movie four stars (for originality and for its contribution to the genre),with a bigger budget(a Leone/Morricone kind of treatment),better dialogue (the dub-job was,quite frankly,abyssmal)and some fine tuning on the plot,this movie could have been the greatest western of all time.The opening scene where this mysterious stranger (Django)is dragging this coffin through the mud and its contrast against the sentimental crooning of the opening music is,possibly,one of the weirdest visuals I've ever seen in a movie,let alone a western.There are a couple of stomach turningly violent scenes that I did not care for and the body count is probably comparable to &quot;the matrix&quot;....I dont know what all to say...This is one weird,gloomy,gothic,machine gun,spaghetti western.The addition of the trailer and the Franco Nero interview were nice bonuses.
0767836251|5.0|Cruel intention is one of the best movies i have ever seen, its exciting, sexy and totally wonderful! It has it all. The actors and actresses are fantastic, and the storie and lines the same. I have nothing bad to say about it. Sebastian and Kathryn are a perfect team, loving to do bad things. Anette is the girl Sebastian has fall in love with, and Kathryn wants to get revange on her boyfriend who dumped her and decides to do it on Cecile. It all have a exciting and &quot;sad&quot; end. Buy it, i dont think that you will regret it!
B000002UAX|5.0|This is simpy a great album.  It, along with several other beatles albums, is one of the greatest albums ever made. There are songs the I don't like (revolution #9, wild honey pie), but there are also enough great songs to fill at least 2 whole albums.  If I were you i would buy it.
6305807086|1.0|This so called comedy is one of the worst films I have ever seen.While I love Cusack and Diaz this film ranks as their most lackluster performances. I must admit the the storyline is the most unique in recent times. But this alone cannot carry a film. The repetitive nature of this film adds to the annoying nature of it. For example, falling out of thin air onto a hiway on-ramp, while humerous the first time, lost its affect after the 8th and 9th time. So, if you are wondering weather or not you should view this garbage, my advice is a resounding no!
B00005JGAF|4.0|While not quite as strong as their first two records, &quot;Rocket to Russia&quot; is still an impressive release.  The best songs (&quot;Cretin Hop&quot;, &quot;Here Today, Gone Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;I Don't Care&quot;) easily equal the high standard set by the band's previous output, but the inclusion of two half-baked covers (&quot;Do you Wanna Dance?&quot; and the far-too-obvious &quot;Surfin' Bird&quot;) hint at the rot that would soon set in and reduce the band to self-parody.  On the plus side, this CD reissue includes a version of &quot;It's a Long Way Back to Germany&quot; which was originally a UK-only B-side and is an absolute mindblower.

B000002MFN|5.0|I usually pop this CD in my stereo after listening to Prince. It keeps the whole dance party mood going. My favorite songs are the title track, \\"Where Life Begins\\" and \\"Fever\\". The title track has a great beat to it with awesome lyrics and a melody that will get stuck in your headforever. \\"Where Life Begins\\" is a fun. \\"Fever\\" is a Peggy Lee Cover that has been transformed into a euphoric, sultry club anthem. I also love \\"Bad Girl\\" and \\"Deeper and Deeper\\". It's an irrisistable album, and it's definitely my favorite Madonna cd. The other cd to buy along with this is Bedtime Stories.
B0000065M3|4.0|If you love Elvis movies, you'll love this one as well!  There isn't much singing in it, so this movie has a more realistic feel to the story than most of Elvis' movies.  This movie proves that you don't have to show explicit sexual scenes to have a thought provoking story.
B000005ILF|5.0|I lost interest in Sting after his excellent album &quot;Nothing Like The Sun...&quot;, because I thought the quality of his writing was decreasing. So I never even bothered listening to this album. That was until I was travelling in Asia for three months and I got the tape as a gift from a fellow-traveller. As I only had five tapes with me it was a welcome change, so I gave it a chance. At first I thought: another unremarkable Sting album, but repeated listenings got me hooked on it more and more. I think I must have listened to it at least thirty times now and it still does not bore me. The songs are beautifully varied and the production is perfect: every song gets exactly the right musical foil, be it with a little bit of Hammond organ or with backing horns, but all the time with the delightful driving drumming of Vinnie Colaiuta (the sound of his drums are changed according to the song's need). Sting himself sounds very engaged (his singing of &quot;You Still Touch Me&quot; reminds of The Police era and his phrase &quot;We try to do the best within the given time&quot; on &quot;I'm So Happy That I Can't Stop Crying&quot; brings tears to my eyes) to complement the perfect musical production. All in all an album that requires repeated listenings to be fully appreciated and once there it is there to stay! Give it a chance, you will not regret it!
0393307050|4.0|This is a pretty neat book, especially for those people with an interest in 19th century happenings, sailing, naval operations, etc. There was more than one occasion when I needed to reach for a dictionary. The related &quot;Sea of Words&quot; book is a necessity to fully see the pictures O'Brian paints with his words. I have already ordered another 4 books in this series. Also, I have started collecting the artwork shown on the covers of the books - it is quite a discussion starter to have the artwork displayed just above the shelf or table with the book adorned with the art on its cover!
0804115613|5.0|I first purchased this book after being enchanted by the movie, and whereas I was prepared to be disappointed (expectations and all) I found that I liked the book just as much and for different reasons.<br />The story line that I so loved is there - the story of friendships across the ages and through different hardships.  And the feeling of the warmth of the South shines through as well.  But it is Fannie Flagg's use of the written word that pleased me as well, it is lyrical, and it touches the heart.<br />This is only a short novel, but it is so full of passion and humour that it is hard not to think of it as a big book.  It is delightful and I recommend it highly.
B00005ATQD|5.0|I just love the barrage of criticism which issued forth when this movie came out.  Some fundamentalists and radical feminists called Kubrick every name in the book over one aspect of the film - the overt displays of sex.<br />What those people are missing, however, is that *Eyes Wide Shut* is one of the most powerful, unflinching, and lyrical arguments FOR marital fidelity and chastity to grace the Big Screen since the exploitative &quot;anything-goes&quot; moral havoc of the Sixties.  I see it as an attempt to explore and conquer those ugly twin demons, Jealousy and Decadence.<br />This movie is not for children.  I wouldn't let a child or teenager within a country mile of it.  It's also not for &quot;adults&quot; whose intellectual prowess and depth of emotion stop at waist-level.  However, for adults with properly formed consciences who can see the sex and nudity in the movie for what it is (a most visceral depiction - and implicit condemnation - of Euro-American decadence and the bitter fruit of the absence of an objective moral standard) *Eyes Wide Shut* is a thunderously beautiful and complex morality tale.<br />Under these conditions, I would highly recommend this film.
B00005A1PR|5.0|At first when I heard &quot;video&quot; on the radio, I thought India Arie was going to be a one hit wonder, but then I heard some of the songs on here and I quickly changed my mind, went out and bought it, and I haven't regretted it since, I love this album especially her song &quot;Wonderful&quot; dedicated to Stevie Wonder.  It's a beautifully written song.  But overall the whole album is excellent.  So please spend your money on this one, it's well worth it.
0451167716|5.0|This is a great book on many levels.  Firstly it is a fascinating and detailed book of an Italian family living and loving in the land of opportuntity.  It is historically accurate, richly detailed, and utterly believable.<br />Secondly it has wonderful characters.  The Don himself and his family; the different people from varied circumstances who are driven to ask him favours for whatever reasons; and the people of rural Sicily.<br />Finally it is a great crime story.  Who can forget the horse's head in the bed?  The shooting in the cafe?  The revenge wreaked on a daughter's rapists?  This is really powerful stuff, and so well written that you forget the horror of it all.<br />This is a truly great book, of difficult times, driven people and how they evolve into what they are.  It is a classic that should be on everyone's reading list.
0767809246|5.0|A smart, sensitive, versatile, fifties set tale which is partly based on the Steven King story, The Body. The film stars a creditable cast which includes Wil Wheaton, River Phoneix, Kiefer Sutherland and Corey Feldman. These superb actors merley compliment the rich dialogue which is astounding throughout resulting in a grittily realistic undertone. The story is of four friends who set out to find the corpse of a missing boy and predictably they find themselves plunged into adventures and there are many twists and surprises to the plot along the way. Rob Reiners debut feature as a director is a classic one at that and merley kick started his career. This film remains something of a total masterpiece.
B0000019PA|5.0|to read the near-irrational hatred some people feel towards this disc.  Personally, I haven't been affected by a record like this in a long while...it shimmers and falls, leaps and shines.  The music and lyrics create a world fundamental and warped both at once.  Mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers float by like ghosts from a half-forgotten dream.  The overarching theme is loss...if you've ever lost someone close to you, especially a family member, you may end in tears.  Everything here is remembered, nothing lasts, nothing is present for this left-behind boy, drowned in formaldehyde at some anguished sideshow thousands of years removed from some wondrous childhood --&quot;wrapped in gold silver sleeves left beneath Christmas trees in the snow&quot; -- heart breaking, lovely.
B00004SCX6|1.0|There is no getting around the facts~this is a horrible excuse for a CD. This is American music at it's worst. I am ashamed that I have this CD. Britney's voice sounds like a dying cat and it basically sounds like shes getting &quot;busy&quot; on most of the CD. She shows no talent as an artist. Britney co-wrote the last song on the CD, called &quot;Dear Diary&quot;. My four year old sister could write a better song than that. I am boycotting all Britney music forever and I hope you do the same. It's sad that she gets all the fame and money when there are many more young musically blessed girls waiting in the shadows.
B00000272N|5.0|In my view Alice in Chains is tied with Soundgarden for being the best band to come out of Seattle, only Alice in Chains got labeled as a grunge band when they really weren't at all.  In fact, AIC was really a metal band that had a lot of melody and crunching guitars courtesy of the great Jerry Cantrell.  The classic &quot;Man in the Box&quot; is here, as is what I believe is the best AIC song ever, &quot;Love, Hate, Love&quot;, where lead singer Layne Staley sings of a lost love and sounds very homicidal while singing it.  Alice in Chains may not have realized it, but they along with Pantera started the whole aggro, angst ridden rock that inspired bands like Korn, Machine Head, and the Union Underground, but sadly AIC never gets the recognition they deserve.
B00004Z459|5.0|Now, if u are some kinda stupid hick, this cd is not for you. but i think i speak for most of us when i say GET THIS CD. Burn it, buy it, all the same, just get your hands on it. needless to say if u couldn't guess by the overall theme of this reveiw and the rating i gave it, it RULES.
B000059XUO|5.0|The Crow was originally a comic series that was very dark, dreary, and gothic that told stories of vengeance from beyond the grave.  Director Alex Proyas (who directed my favorite movie of all time Dark City) uses his great direction to make James O'Barr's classic comic come to life.  Sadly, actor Brandon Lee never lived to see how successful The Crow would become, this movie would have made him a superstar.  If you love this movie like I do, get the equally fantastic soundtrack to go along with it, you won't regret it.
0688101364|4.0|Rose Beranbaum, the author, must simply love what she does.  All of her books just shine with enthusiasm and mirth.  Couple that with her precision and good taste and you have wonderful recipes, every time.  There are full-color photos accompanying every single recipe, and Beranbaum's comments are truly fun and memorable.<br />The cookies range from homespun to exotic.  One of the exotic cookies that I love is the delicate snowflakes made out of meringue.  She also has the BEST homemade dog biscuit recipe I have ever made.  Dogs will do absolutely anything in their power to get these biscuits!!<br />The cookies in this book are ones that you would serve to your most exalted guests, but most are easy enough to make any time, so don't wait for Christmas, use it all year round.
B0000028M7|5.0|Dirt is by far AIC's best album, and contains a lot of the songs that made AIC rock so much.  This is the original angst ridden music that the youth of that generation ate up, much like the uninspired angst rock that the kids eat up today.  The difference being is Alice in Chains had passion in everything they wrote.  Jerry Cantrell is not only a great guitarist but a great songwriter, and Layne Staley's voice will never be matched, ever.  It's a shame Alice in Chains aren't around today, they could show these nu-metal bands what real aggro rock is.
0062511408|4.0|Era muy facil para leer y tambien muy interesante.  El argumento del libro hace que no puede dejar de leer por un minuto.   La cosa mala: algunos aspectos espirituales que son confundidos a veces.  Parece que el libro es una alegoria seglar del libro La Oracion de Jabes.   Compre este libro y empezara a seguir su &quot;Historia Personal&quot;.
B00003CX5A|5.0|Sleepy Hollow is on par with every other great Tim Burton film (the original Batman, Nightmare Before Christmas), and there is good reason why.  Burton takes the old Washington Irving story and twists it in ways only he can think of.  The Headless Horseman is decapitating people left and right, and constable Ichabod Crane (played great by Johnny Depp) is assigned to catch the murderer.  Little does he know what awaits him...  The storyline is great, and very engrossing, and the sets and costumes are of the highest quality, as is the acting.  If you haven't seen this yet I strongly recommend you do, it's great!
0060930187|5.0|Before I began reading &quot;The Bell Jar,&quot; my father warned me: &quot;That's one depressing book.&quot;  I pressed on anyway, and in a matter of two days, finished one of the most honest and touching books that I have ever read.  I saw myself in Esther Greenwood, a young woman of my age who finds herself nauseated at the increasingly narrowing path down which young women in the 1950's are being led.  Her candid observations about sex, her peers, the city, her school, and her family, echoed thoughts that I have often entertained in my own mind.  Esther has little interest in being a mother and living in the suburbs--she is not even certain that she wants to be married.  It is for her refusal to accept the role that society prescribes to women that she is rendered crazy by her mother, her peers, and her doctors.  If Esther Greenwood is indeed crazy, then I wonder about the mental health of myself and many of my friends.  I propose that it was not Esther's mind that drove her to attempt suicide--it was a confining society that kept her from feeling free enough to explore her own interests and goals; and being understood by her mother and the other people who loved her.  &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; spoke to a generation of women who would come of age in the 1960's, and would help to give them the confidence and the courage to change the world.
0780622553|5.0|Alex Proyas, the man who brought us the movie adaption of The Crow (the first and only good one), returns with his latest incarnation, the fantastic Dark City.  Rufus Sewell plays John Murdoch, a man who can't remember who he is, and why he's being accused of murder.  But what John does know is something is not right with the city, and the people he meets on his journey looking for his home, change his life forever, and his ultimate discovery changes everything.  To say this movie is a mindtrip is saying it lightly.  Alex Proyas has a very vivid sense of direction, the sets and cinematography are like none I've ever seen in a movie, not to mention the storyline was the most original story at it's time (The Matrix takes a page from it), add that to great performances from Sewell, Kiefer Sutherland, and William Hurt, and you have a very special movie that only comes along not very often.  The special effects are a very nice touch too and add to the experience even more.  In my view Dark City is the greatest sci-fi movie ever made, it beats The Matrix, Star Wars, Star Trek, and every sci-fi franchise in great measure.  The ending will haunt you for a while and leave you breathless when the climax unfolds.  All in all, this is a sci-fi classic that should be seen by everyone whether they love sci-fi movies or not.  Thank you Alex Proyas for making a truly legendary film.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|This is a great soundtrack! Sure, some of the bits are SLIGHTLY different, but y'all should get over yourselves! And Specacular Spectacular's in here! Just not all of it. And who reallly cares if &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot; isn't in here, it's definitely not one of the movie's better ones! Ewan's songs are the higher points of this, along with &quot;El Tango de Roxanne&quot; and &quot;Sparkling Diamonds&quot; and &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; and &quot;Complainte de la Butte&quot; and...well, all of them! It's a good soundtrack even if you don't see the movie! (Which then I would say you have some problems, because it's a terrific movie, but hey, to each his own, or something like that) But, I can guaratee that if you buy this, you'll want to go see the movie immediately afterward. (I did, because I bought this a week or two before the movie came out!) This is definitely a soundtrack worth buying! (Everyone else who's moaning about how tiny parts are different or left out or whatever should really be quiet!) SEE THE MOVIE AND BUY THE SOUNDTRACK!
0452282152|2.0|I thought the story was too simple and it failed to transport me to Old Delft as I had expected.  Besides the Meat Market, the Beast Market and doing laundry by hand, I didn't see anything remarkable about the Delft that the author created.  It might as well have been any rich household in any country outside of the US.  I've never been to Holland and I could have made up the same details.  The story itself was too simple: a maid gets painted by Vermeer and his wife doesn't like it.  First of all, I personally find it unlikely that Vermeer needed a maid to clean his studio every day.  I found the drama in the story to be oversized, simple things are made into a big deal.  Everytime Griet cries or feels an injustice done to her, I just didn't see what the big deal was.  Since the story is done in Griet's voice, you don't get to know the other characters as well and you know almost nothing of Vermeer.  Throughout the book, he's simply known as &quot;he&quot;.  I think it was an unwise decision to write the book in Griet's voice especially because we keep hearing how she's smarter than she lets on and how she's so wise she can see through people's words.  It would have been more effective and believable if the compliments were coming from an observer rather than herself.  It made her story less believable in a sense by writing it in first person.

0060392886|5.0|Hardcore rock and roll from some of the best.  Great, entertaining stories and histories of the band members and their trials and tribulations through their success.  The book can, at times be a bit repetetive.  I love the Crue and their music so that didn't bother me at all. Highly reccomended for rock fans. If you listen to generic little boy and girl bands you will hate this book.
B00004THAY|4.0|I just got back from a missions trip to Romania.  During that trip, we drove across the country, and we were in the van for a total of over 35 hours.  This cd, especially &quot;Marry You&quot; made the trip fun.  we all sang along to the aforementioned track, including the three Romanian kids we had along for the journey.  So, thanks, B.B. King, for the memories
B00003CXE7|5.0|Russel Crowe is known as a great actor, and this is definetely one of his finest movies. The music was excellent, the battle scenes are done excellently (although some of the actual war techniques could have been researched and done better) and the picture quality is excellent-o. <br />The story of this Roman general is uplifting and symbolic, nevermind unrealistic. But it is a very entertaining movie to watch, and if you don't I fear there is something wrong with your mind. Well worth the money to add to your DVD collection.

B00003CXP1|5.0|I thought it was absolutely brilliant, right from the actors chosen to play the addicts they were to the set design that was used in each scene...  Funny thing is, I watched Traffic right after this and it was like, Why bother? Traffic was mindnumbing next to this and actually made me laugh when I saw the kid get taken to the hospital for overdosing on cocaine... um, yeah, right. Not bloody likely! I recommend it as a buy for anyone that appreciates and respects addiction for what it can truly do to the human psyche.
B00004WGC4|2.0|I had always heard this was one of the absolute classics of British TV sit-comedy.  In an interview with the League of Gentlemen recently one of them calls it &quot;the best thing ever done.&quot;  So I sat down a couple of nights ago to watch some episodes, for the very first time, with high expectations.<br />What a letdown!  There is a certain distinctive style of British TV comedy (maybe this series was the archetype), in which all the characters scream at all the other characters, in every scene--- or for  occasional variety, one character screams at all the other characters!  It isn't funny.  [The first season of BLACKADDER had this problem, but the later seasons do not, making it, along with RED DWARF and RISING DAMP, among the best of the best.]<br />Since Basil Fawlty is in essentially every scene of FAWLTY TOWERS, he needs to be a character that makes some kind of sense... but instead he's an incoherent grab-bag of inconsistent elements. For example, he often says witty or clever things, and yet he is depicted as utterly mindless, incapable of drawing even the simplest correct conclusion about any situation, or deciding on any viable course of action.  The supporting characters are all one-note, but that's the way supporting characters are supposed to be.  It all hinges on Basil, and Basil is a hollow reed.  He isn't funny to look at, funny to listen to, or funny in his interactions with other characters and with the world around him.<br />I laughed a few times while watching the tape, but where I expected some comedy classic, I just saw a bunch of senseless, unmotivated and often very unfunny antics.<br />If you don't detect the slightest difference between the Three Stooges, Laurel and Hardy, and Abbott and Costello, you may well find this a &quot;classic of comedy.&quot;  Otherwise, it is going to be a viewing experience somewhat more painful than it is amusing .
0060930187|5.0|In a simple phrase, this book was awe inspiring. After I read the last page, I broke down in tears it was so incredible. I dont think I've ever read another book with such realism and emotion. Silvia Plath truly outdid herself when she wrote The Bell Jar. I laughed, I cried, I felt her pain as if it were my own. Truly miraculous for anyone who lays eyes on it.
B00005ATQF|5.0|When Saving Private Ryan came out, it inspired a craze for war.  War was a hip again.  (But never see Enemy at the Gates).  So I guess that's one of the reasons I decided to see Full Metal Jacket.  I not going to tell which one was better of the two, but they are both great in different ways.  Saving Private Ryan's (SPR from now on) characters were very shallow and stereotypical.  The war scenes , of course, were incredible.  After that movie, you can compare other war scenes to see if they're realistic or not; as if you'd been in combat yourself.  But Full Meatl Jacket was a lot different.  For one, the first half of the movie takes place at Parris Island, a boot camp for enlisted men.  And this introduces two of the best chraracters in cinema history; right up there with Wolverine, Tyler Durden, anyone in Goodfellas and Guy Pearce in anything.  The first, Gunnery Sergeant Hartman.  This drill insrtuctor is intense, fast-talking, violent, intimidating and very well acted.  And he doesn't soften up at the end because he knows his soldiers are unique, beautiful flowers.  You'll see other movie's D.I.s and wish for this man to run in.  The other character is comically nicknamed Gomer Pyle; real name Leonard.  He is obviously a man who does not belong in the Marine Core.  He' slow, out of shape, hated by other privates, hated by the Drill Instructor, and never should have left his mother's side.  Vincent D'Onofrio plays this character so perfectly that you're convinced that's what he is like.  Vincent, being a great underrated actor, is a wonderful character actor (look for him in The Cell, Men In Black and The Player).   But the D.I. is convinced he will toughen him up, but not with positive comments and rewards.  The climax of this first half is awe-inspiring, and shows the horrors of war which don't even take place overseas.  The main character and narrator throughout the movie is Pvt. Joker played by Matthew Modine.  He is a humorous character who uses his sarcasmas a cover and a way to point out wars contradictions and satires.  He's a strong character who doesn't need to have flashbacks of is best friend back at home.   The movie follows him through the Boot Camp and then in the Vietnam War, starting with the Tet Offensive.  There are so many characters in this movie, and they are so memorable, that it's hard to choose a favorite.  They all seem real, with real emotions and actions.  One favorite is Animal Mother; he seems like a war crazy 'animal', but when his own 'friends' get shot down by a sniper, he is intensely moved to risk his life (in my opinion).  In this last scene, invovling one enemy sniper, Stanley Kubrick inflicts emotions beautifully.  Your always expecting this guy to get picked off, or you call one guy stupid because he will get shot, or you even feel sorry for both the sniper and the Americn G.I's.  The music that starts up when they look for the sniper is so eerie and really gives you a sense of what Kubrick was all about(since we all knew him).  The very last scene shows a big group of American soldiers walking in the night, singing the Mickey Mouse Club theme song.  It's ironic; you see all these horrible things the men did and said, but they can still sing a corny song in perfect melody, like you and me.  In conclusion, Full Metal Jacket is a great movie with scenes and images that will stick in your mind.  Even now, so many of its' lines are brutally stolen with out the proper recongniton.  So if you want a movie that realistically depicts war and that everyone likes (except the stupid Academy), go see SPR, but if you want a movie that expresses ideas through well-done characters and plot and goes its' own way; get a FULL tank of gas, put the pedal to the METAL, if it's cold, wear a JACKET, and rent that one movie.
B00005ASOI|2.0|I urge all of you to wait for the official Anchor Bay release in October/November! This is a cheap Fox version of the movie and it is edited! Wait until Anchor Bay releases the full unedited version on DVD! It will also include the soundtrack as well.
B00002MZ2T|4.0|After about two years, Savage Garden returned with their second album, Affirmation.  The first single off this new album, \\"I Knew I Loved You\\", proved that Savage Garden is no one-hit-wonder, by hitting Billboard's #1 once again.  Compared to the first album, this one is much more personal, with a bittersweet taste to it.  The talent is still there as they continued to write all their songs on the album; Darren's voice sounds even better on this album, and attempts of creating a distinct character for each song is still apparent, but lyrical and musical themes and begin to become repetitive, with recurring themes of obsession and being heartbroken and instrumental basis of solid piano chords in both \\"Two Beds and a Coffee Machine\\" and \\"I Don't Know You Anymore\\".  The former is perhaps one of the most outstanding songs on the album as it touches a darker subject-domestic abuse-and clearly defines that Savage Garden is more than a pop boy band; but the latter, along with a few other songs on the album (\\"The Lover After Me\\", \\"Crash and Burn\\") are based on such common themes that they become rather disappointing.  However, the little details in the lyrics still manage to make the songs more beautiful than most others of along the same line.<br />My personal favourites of the album include \\"The Animal Song\\", a lively tune about getting away from all the rules and complications of this world, originating from the soundtrack of The Other Sister, and \\"Gunning Down Romance\\", a slow but very strong song both lyrically and musically.  The title track, \\"Affirmation\\", filled with lines of personal beliefs, is also outstanding, and sets the mood for the whole album.<br />It's a change from the first album, more personal and perhaps a little darker, but the topics tend to go around in circles.  However, it still has a lot of variation and incredible talent compared to all the other albums out there.
6300263673|5.0|Everybody has a movie like this...One that you saw when you were 12 years old and thought it was the greatest story you had ever seen. And, even though years later when you watch it again, you see the flaws and the dodgy storylines, Dirty Dancing still has magic. I don't think its magic lies with any one element (although the dancing, music and actors are all very appealing) but it certainly captured the imagination of a certain age group.
0380973650|2.0|Often times poets are chastised for turning to novels, as are journalists, playwrights, whatever.  So why should we reserve anything different for graphic novelists or more appropriately comicists?  Gaiman's Sandman series is unarguably one of the finest stories to hit graphic novels/comics.  The characters and plots are vivid and I found myself zooming through each book eager to read the next.  As a novelist Gaiman falls flat, while the plot of American Gods kept me reading, the wordy descriptions and trite, sometimes down right awful metaphors, had me cringing with every page I turned. How many events can be correlated with a boy letting out piss in a warm pool, I mean really?  While the characters were alive I longed for the dark art of the comic book to release me from the hell of prose that Gaiman has no handle on, nor talent for.  This book may be the best argument for comic books to take a place as more than just a genre itself. Maus, Sandman, these are stories that would not be as powerful without the visual accompaniment of the art.  Gaiman is a talented graphic novelist, he is *NOT* a non-illustrated novelist in any sense of the word.
B00003CX5P|1.0|Part of what makes the Star Wars trilogy so timeless and enjoyable to watch today is that it was written and produced for adults, which we all gorw up to be.  Sure, we may have missed some of the jokes and misunderstood the characters when we were younger but understanding it now makes the movies worth watching over and over again.    Episode 1 on the other hand is a feel good kids movie with about as much depth and intellegence as a McDonalds kiddie soda.  McD's should come up with their own marketable character rather than making Star Wars enthusiasts suffer through the idiotic ramblings of JarJar Binks.  This movie is a short sighted sell out.  I hope the chocolate shakes and stuffed animals George Lucas sold on this one made him a fat profit because this movie has no place in an adult's movie collection.  Hold onto your money, rent this one if you must see it at all.
B00005LB9O|5.0|Some people might call &quot;The Invisible Band&quot;  a predictable album, since it is very close in song-style and construction as &quot;The Man Who,&quot; Travis's second fantastic CD. But I think it is perfect. I listen to it at work, and it makes perfect background music. It doesn't necessarily distract me (except when I want it to!) and it isn't bothersome or loud to the people around me. I've even gotten complements on it, people asking me who it is. &quot;Dear Diary&quot; is one of my favorites, a soft lullaby that puts you at peace without putting you to sleep. &quot;The Cage&quot; and &quot;Last Train&quot; each have a haunting quality to them, having Fran Healy use lyirics like &quot;I'm gonna write a song, gonna sing it to everyone,&quot; and morph them into &quot;I'm gonna buy a gun, gonna shoot everything, everyone.&quot; In today's world, those words are taken very seriously, but coming from this band, they are simply a cry for help; &quot;my broken heart is cracked again, someone help me mend it. I can't sing my song without it.&quot; &quot;The Humpty Dumpty Song&quot; is a great mix of comedy, heartbreak, passion and nursery rhyme. Who out there cannot relate to pleading &quot;I need you; I just need you&quot;? It hits me in absolutely the right spot. I love it. <br />Perhaps I'm just a hopeless romantic, but I love these songs. They are as peaceful as they are sensual, they rock as much as they calm, all at the same time. Great arrangements, great instrumental and vocal performances, once again. People who are already acquainted with Travis will enjoy it. Those of you out there who liked &quot;Yellow&quot; from Coldplay, you'll love Travis. So much better than Coldplay.<br />At any rate, perfect album for Travis to follow up &quot;The Man Who&quot; with, taking their signature sound up just a hair to keep it fresh. Highly recommended
0671045857|5.0|While I enjoyed the story, and Stephen King is always wonderful, I really must comment on Anne Heche's reading/performance. She is mezmerizing!

I highly recommned listening to this book.
0394716787|4.0|Edgar A. Poe (he never used Allan in print) has yet to be served by a collection worthy of a writer of his stature.  This one certainly does a good job of collecting a great deal of material, including rarities as well as all the stories and poems you already know and love and even his only novel, &quot;The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym.&quot;  But the sequence of the works is random (not chronological, as I had hoped) and no notes are provided.  Plus, the book's size makes it hard to read without some sort of physical support.  Still, it's one of the more complete Poe collections around, and the price is reasonable for a book of this size.<br />For greater understanding of the short and tumultuous life that produced such astounding works of the imagination, I suggest reading &quot;Edgar A. Poe:  Mournful and Never-Ending Rememberance&quot; by Kenneth Silverman in conjunction with this volume.  I found it very enlightening to read a couple of chapters of Silverman's entertaining and informative biography, then read only the works produced during that particular period of Poe's life.  Aside from the advantage of following his development as a writer and gaining a better understanding of the inspriration behind his work, you get a better cross-section of Poe's extraordinary range -- from comic satirist to journalist to detective fiction writer to, of course, the supreme creator of the horror and science fiction story.

B000005RFQ|1.0|I remember how psyched my high school friends &amp; I were when we heard that Ian Gillan from Deep Purple was joining our favorite band Black Sabbath. We of course loved the Ozzy era and were pleasantly surprised at how well Ronnie James Dio of Ritchie Balckmore's Rainbow did, especially on the Heaven &amp; Hell album. By all accounts fellow Blackmore alumnus Ian Gillan should have blazed an equally interesting path with Tony Iommi &amp; Co. But amidst the hype (and booze) they forgot to write some songs. Thankfully Gillan went on to rejoin Deep Purple the next year for their strong Perfect Strangers comeback album. But Born Again should have been aborted in the first trimester of recording.
0385501560|3.0|&quot;Choke&quot; demonstrates Chuck Palahniuk's strong points in full effect--namely a flowing, involving narration combined with harsh bits of truth-telling about modern life.  This, like any of his other novels, is the type of book you whip through in a frenzy, although once the end is reached it feels unfulfilling.<br />But for a while, &quot;Choke&quot; is very excellent.  It's the tale of Victor Mancini, a con artist who fakes choking spells in public restaurants to make any given person feel heroic (he's also in it to exploit people's generousity for $); he views himself as a saint, and with the assistance of an alleged doctor and his dying mother, he's convinced that he's the second coming of Christ, put on the earth to do good.  But at a certain point he begins to resent this and has no desire but to be the dirtiest SOB ever, something he achieves through sex with a succession of loose women and a growing lack of remorse.<br />Palahniuk's approach to religious themes is anything but subtle; he's at the pulpit, belting out line after line of faux-derisive, faux-uplifting platitudes.  The last hundred pages, especially, are hampered by an over-saturation of this Bible-thumping hooey.<br />The strongest points in &quot;Choke&quot; involve flashback scenes of Victor as a child, being carted from adventure to adventure by his loon/hippie mother; in these passages, Palahniuk offers up refreshingly liberated viewpoints on life and all that could be, without being schmaltzy.  Also, the scenes which take place at Victor's job (a historical reenactment park) are priceless--right down to his description of what drug every employee is on.<br />But alas, Palahniuk's key problem is bringing up too many subjects and not giving them an equal amount of attention.  Not to be trite, but he seems to be biting off a bit more than he can chew with &quot;Choke.&quot;  A subplot involving a friend of Victor's who collects rocks to build an obscure sculpture is too dull to provide any lasting symbolism.  An extended passage about sex in airplane bathrooms seems out of place and goes nowhere.  And the scenes which show off Victor's addiction to sex--while often very funny--feel almost gimmicky.<br />And in keeping with the twists that occur in the last 20 pages of &quot;Fight Club&quot; and &quot;Invisible Monsters,&quot; Palahniuk somehow feels the need to tear down everything at the end of &quot;Choke,&quot; as well.  Only here the revelations aren't as exciting as they are trite and manipulative of the reader's intelligence.<br />For what it's worth, &quot;Choke&quot; is a novel that flows beautifully and can zip by quickly, and furthers Palahniuk's status as a more intellectual and eloquent version of Bret Easton Ellis.  The man can write well, there's no doubt about it, but he needs to work on evening out the rough edges before going to print.e any lasting symbolism.

B000002LND|5.0|The Immaculate Collection is THE showcase of all her best material. I love Madonna, and most of my favorites were released bewteen 1982 and 1992. From the cheerful sounds of Holiday to the haunting Live To Tell to the dramatic anti-abortion cry Papa Don't Preach, *&quot;I'm keeping my baby&quot; is not a reference to her lover.* to the one-of-a-kind dance track Vogue, *Her best song ever* Immaculate Collection is an absolute awesome collection of Queen Madonna's best years. My favorites are Holiday, Lucky Star, Material Girl, Crazy For You, Into The Groove, Live To Tell, Papa Don't Preach, Like A Prayer, Express Yourself, Vogue, and Rescue Me. I think Madonna should perhaps make a 4 CD collection of all the original versions of her biggest hits from the last 20 years, plus 2 discs full of her best remixes. But until then, Immaculate Collection will do.
B000002LR3|4.0|I remember all the raves this album got back in the day, and distinctly remember deliberately skipping it, because where most critics are concerned, the fashion and intrigue of the 'e' culture were more important than the music.  Consequently how good could the music have been if it was just a soundtrack to oblivion?<br />I did check out 'Give Out But Don't Give Up' when it was released to similar fanfare, and thought it passionate but uninspired--a 3 star rating all the way through.  So my initial write-off of 'Screamadelica' was thereby warranted.<br />After so many years, though, my curiousity got the best of me. I stumbled on a used copy, and while I don't agree that it's a classic album amongst albums, but it's definitely a solid, inspired effort that obviously still impresses people 10 years after it's release.  It's the best 'representative' album of the scene, and Stones-psychedelia pastiche or not, the Scream's later albums would never get this good.<br />Most bands or artists only ever release one good album of substance in their entire careers; this one is likely Primal Scream's Mona Lisa.

The only song I see as unlistenable is Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know. The rest range from beautiful ballads such as Where Are You Now, Lucky, and the self-penned Dear Diary, to kicking dance tracks such as the title track, Stronger, which is my favorite Brit song ever, *You have to get the maxi-single with the remixes.* her cover of the Rolling Stones' Satisfaction, What U See Is What U Get, and Can't Make You Love Me, Britney has offered her fans an album that is 10x better than her first album.

B00005B4GU|5.0|I'm writing this in response to the poor reviews some people have given Amnesiac. They seem to all hail &quot;The Bends&quot; and &quot;OK Computer&quot; and seem to want the band to make carbon copies of those albums for the rest of their career. I admit that they are great albums, but I for one am extreamly grateful that Radiohead are evolving and constatnly challenging me as a listener.<br />Still, even you you can't wrap your head around the newer Radiohead material, don't fault them for not playing the same style of music you used to make out to in college. They've matured, and I would suggest you do the same.<br />Last, I have to say that Radiohead with all their albums, Amnesiac included, are the only band - other than say Pink Floyd or The Beatles - that makes albums I can listen to 50, 100, 500 (a lot!) times and still love every minute of it. That wouldn't be the case if they were fomulaic and predictable.

I also guessed that the Husband who was &quot;dead&quot; would make like Lazarus and come back to life and along with the runaway Dog would save everyone from certain death. Meryl Streep acted as though she was half awake and bored during the entire movie, she hardly woke up when the raft went down the rapids. Save your time and money and pick a different film.

B00000AFWW|5.0|This cd is truly great.  ....With the exception of Northern Star and can listen to the whole cd and never get tired of it.  Most of Hole's cds are a lot of rock but this cd has some pop sounding music in it as well as rock.  First, Celebrity Skin is just an all around great song.  The music is rock, the lyrics are great, and what's great about this song is that the lyrics and the chorus change so that your not hearing the same chorus and lyrics over and over again.  Awful is more of a pop song I think, and I alos think it's really cute.  Hit So Hard is kind of depressing but it's still good.  It's another pop song.  Malibu is kind of rock and pop put together if you can picture that.  It's got good lyrics.  When I first heard Reason to be Beautiful I really liked the chorus.  It's a rock song that's kind of depressing...but I still like it.  Dying is probably my favorite song on the cd.  It's a ballad that's not depressing at all even though the name might throw you off.  It's got great music.  Use Once & Destroy isn't my favorite but I like the whole \\"All dressed in red always the bride\\" part.  It's more of a rock song.  Northern Star is my least favorite song.  It's too slow for me.  Boys on the Radio is definatly a pop song but it's cute.  Heaven Tonight has really cool background music but the lyrics are kind weird.  I'm kinda wondering about the galloping parts....  Playing Your Song definatly is my 2nd favorite.  It sounds like a song from Hole's earlier cds.  It's a real hard rock song.  I don't really understand the lyrics...if it's really about someone who stole another person's song or what.  But I really like that song.  Petals is cute but also kind of depressing.  I like the background music in this song too.  Hole's Celebrity Skin is definatly worth it.  It's really a great cd.

Well I just got the Soundtrack and if you have seen the movie I suggest that you get the soundtrack too but the only song it is missing on the soundtrack is the funniest part of all and it is where Harry Zidler was singing the song like a virgin but oh well.
B00005LMBK|5.0|This is the best cd that I heard in a long time.  I feel like I  have been waiting for this cd to come out for like ever...only I just started getting into Gorillaz about a month ago.  This is one of the 4 cds that I absolutly love.  I only wish Gorillaz would get the attention they deserve.  I have some favorites on this cd...they're all good though.  Tomorrow Comes Today is a really pretty song with great music.  Clint Eastwood is of course everyone's favorite...the song that got Gorillaz started in the first place.  Russel is a great rapper and 2-D is the best male singer that I've ever heard (haha).  Sound Check(Gravity)is probably my favorite song on the cd.  It has really awesome music and 2-D sings like an angel LoL.  I think you can even heard a little bit of Russel in the background but maybe that's my imaginattion.... 19-2000 is the coolest song I have heard in a very long time.  I love the music becuase it's spunky and the fact that Noodle is one of the main singers in this song really rocks.  I like Cibo Matto a lot and Miho is great.  It's about time she got some singing time!  Starshine is pretty too...it reminds me of Sound Check(Gravity).  M1 A1 is a really mad cool song excpet for the &quot;Hello is anyone there&quot; part.  It's a real rock song LoL!  Even though these are only a few of the songs on the cd everyone song is great.  Definatly worth buying!
B00005BJ2O|3.0|I really enjoyed the movie and bought the album to feed my addiction.  But there are some really frustrating tracks on this CD.  For everyone who loved hearing Ewan talk his way through the opening lines of &quot;Your Song,&quot; prepare to be disappointed.  &quot;Your Song&quot; on this CD begins with him belting out &quot;my gift is my song&quot; and includes none of the lovely, spoken &quot;it's a little bit funny, this feeling inside.&quot;  <br />Other songs from the movie are present in different versions, like the &quot;Diamonds&quot; medley with Nicole, and the wonderful Roxanne-based tango, which skips the fabulous intro in which the unconscious Argentinian talks about passion and jealousy, accompanied by dramatic piano riffs.  The wonderful, heavily sampled song from the Moulin Rouge dance floor, featuring Zidler, is not here either.  There's no &quot;Like a Virgin,&quot; &quot;So Exciting, It will Run for 50 Years,&quot; or Zidler's rap.  And where is Toulouse's plaintive version of Nature Boy?  <br />What's included from the movie is good, but too much is missing.  The Elephant Love medley fares the best.  But the David Bowie, Aguilera, Beck, Valeria, and Fatboy Slim tracks seem out of place, because you don't hear much of those versions in the movie itself.  Ewan and Nicole can sing, but the CD doesn't feature them enough at all.  The CD misses the spirit of the movie by quite a bit, but I still enjoy the few tracks that stay closest to the film versions.  If you know that you will buy the movie when it's released, this may keep you going until then.
B00003W8NM|5.0|A excellent movie about Jack(Edward Norton)a man who finds an escape from his insomnia in support groups for illnesses. Even though he has no illnesses it's helps him and he can sleep again, until a chain smoking witch named Marla Singer comes along only for the free coffee. He cannot concentrate with another faker around and the insomnia starts again. It soon unravells into him meeting Tyler Durdon (Brad Pitt), a man who's free will and care for nothing leads Jack to follow him. After a late night of drinking Tyler starts a fight with Jack and this realeases pressure aswell. But it soon turns to a giant club that fights every day of the week. A very well done movie so dark and disgusting you feel like taking a shower. Excellent acting on all parts and the fight scenes were gross but beautiful. The end will leave you stunned and a second viewing is almost necessary.
B00005B36H|5.0|In my humble opinion, this is Tool's best CD.  I find it humorous that so many people dislike this album because they do not get it.  This is NOT a metal album.  It is hard to categorize it; Lateralus is actually closer to progressive rock than any other genre.  Granted, Adam Jones' searing distorted guitar, Maynard's crooning vocals, and Danny Carey's superb percussion work are not to be found on the typical King Crimson/Pink Floyd work, but the similarities are there.<br />Track for track, each song is a valuable addition to the whole.  Shorter songs such as Eon Blue Apocalypse and Mantra add a sort of ambience to the album that few &quot;metal&quot; bands have the sense to include.  The last few tracks are largely instrumental and portray Tool's musicianship in a perfect way.  Schism, the first single from the album, is a good song, but it is in no way superior, either sonically or lyrically, to the other treasures on this disc.  The Grudge, Parabol/Parabola, Ticks &amp; Leeches, and Lateralus (yes, that is how you spell the song title...not Lateralis...the first run of the album had a misprint on the back) are all equally impressive.<br />If you enjoy this album, then I recommend other more cerebral bands such as Nine Inch Nails, Pink Floyd, and King Crimson (with whom Tool is currently touring, by the way).<br />On the other hand, if you do not like Lateralus because not every track is 100% metal, there are plenty of other bands to like.  So pick one and leave Tool be.
B00003CXRP|4.0|Movie Summary: Chuck Noland works for Federal Express. He kisses his fianc&eacute;e goodbye on Christmas Eve to take a flight on a Federal Express plane. He tells her he will be right back, but we all know by the title of the movie that he doesn't keep his promise. Chuck's plane goes down in bad weather and Chuck washes up on a very small island with a few Federal Express packages. He spends four years on the island with a volleyball as his only friend until the ocean washes hope up on his shore.<br />My Opinion:  There were three main parts to Cast Away. I liked the island part the best. It was the most intriguing and interesting. I wish there had been more to this part. I wanted to know more about how he spent those four long years. I would have liked to see him build things and deal with the solitude. The first part, although setting up the next two parts, was a little long. The last part was not as satisfying as I had hoped. Chuck remains a castaway even though there is some hope at the end. I enjoyed the movie but found it was only good, and not great.<br />DVD Quality:  Widescreen anamorphic 2.35:1, DD6.1 sound. A complete second disc to hold all the extras which include trailers, featurettes, and documentaries. If you want to know everything about Cast Away, now you can. This is a very good DVD release.<br />What You Should Do:  Buy it if you are a huge Tom Hanks fan or loved the movie in the theater. A rental should do for the rest of us.
6304414145|5.0|In whatever Mr. Sinise seems to do he always comes out on top.  In this movie it really shows by the man playing a cop who is actually holding an eleven year old kid for a two million dollar ransom.  The two sequences in the movie that are very supurb are the ones where Sinise is telling Gibson how to pay him off in the car where he's talking about comparing THE TIME MACHINE to New York City.  The other is the last sequence where he (Sinise) is about to get paid four million dollars by Gibson.  In short Gary Sinise is and will be for a long time one of the most lively and emotional actors on screen and stage.  (Please see him in ONE FLEW OVER THE CUKOO'S NEST on Broadway until the 29th of July.  He plays R.P. McMurphey.  He's better than Douglas and Nicholson)
014028009X|5.0|After seeing this in the movies, I had to read the book!  At first, the choppy sentences and British language was a little hard to read, but I quickly fell in to a comfortable speed and understand and totally loved this book.  It made me laugh out loud at times and feel like this book was written about me!  It is the story about the life of a 30-something single girl, but this presents it in a hilarious way and makes us realize that we all do silly things to impress friends and men!
0345350499|5.0|This is one book that I have found myself not wanting to put it down. My daughter has read it and even now on my second time reading I still hate to put it down even for a break.
B000003C4K|5.0|Yes, this is no frills, no holds barred thrash metal. From the pounding of the title track to the infernal fury of &quot;Strike Of The Beast&quot;, the only thing to describe this is \m/. Another good thing about this album is that every riff seems to describe a very violent way to die(c'mon, doesn't the opening part of &quot;Piranha&quot; remind you of a swarm of the man-eating fish descending on a victim). If you want a good introduction to old-school thrash, don't pick up anything by Metallica. Pick up Exodus, and they will show you the insanity that Jaymz and co. could never even dream of.
B00003CXE7|5.0|My favorite historical movie of all times has been BRAVEHEART but when I first saw GLADIATOR I was mesmorized for days!!! Russel Crowe is an Awesome actor in this masterpiece I recommend this to anyone interested in Ancient or Roman history.

6305311463|1.0|I watched this movie with the expectation that if I didn't take anything away from it, at least I would have been entertained.<br />Oh God, I was wrong.<br />This movie actually gave me a migrane.  The camera work is consistantly swooping with quick cuts--basically, most of the movie looks like a car commercial or music video (without the substance).  The \\"action sequences\\" were so loud and out of proportion with the rest of the movie, I had to cover my ears.  I wish I could have covered my eyes at the same time.<br />The plot is absolutely worthless and there is no point getting into it.  I saw \\"Deep Impact,\\" and even though the basic concept is just about the same I found that movie immeasurably more entertaining.  And \\"Deep Impact\\" was NOT that good.<br />The characters and the development are SO RAZOR THIN and formulaic that I actually waited until the end of the movie, hoping and praying that the asteroid would hit the Earth and kill them all.  Let's see... Steve Buschimi (one of my favorite actors) as a platform driller, even though he has, what? two (2) PhDs or something like that???  Ben Affleck is overrated because he's good looking.  Liv Tyler is/has/always will be boring if not pleasant to look at.  Bruce Willis can make it, but not with this pathetic vehicle.<br />What an ugly disappointment....
B0000025YM|5.0|This is my second favorite Priest album, next to Painkiller. Many might not like the production here, but I think it is pretty good. Something about it just lures me in. It's got sort of a dark celestial feel on it, kinda conjures up imagery of a night in Valhalla where warriors are holding their swords high ready to defend the faith. Favorites include the opening speed metal flirtation &quot;Freewheel Burning&quot;, the pounding &quot;Jawbreaker&quot;, the cruisin' &quot;Rock Hard, Ride Free&quot; and the epic creme-de-la-creme &quot;The Sentinel&quot;. The one thing that could have been deleted was &quot;Heavy Duty/Defenders Of The Faith&quot;, reminds me too much of a certain overrated stadium song.
B00005B36H|4.0|This will invalidate my review to most Tool fans, but I'm not a huge fan of them. I like their message and I totally 'get' them-but sometimes it seems like Tool are avant garde for the sake of being avant garde. I mean, Undertow rocked my socks, totally 'benchmark' rock album right there. Aenima had its share of good songs (Stinkfist, the amazing title song, Third Eye)but had too much filler and some of the 'real' songs weren't that good. But Lateralus is good. Not one of the best of 2001, but really good. It would be kind of a waste to praise how good Lateralus is-Tool is good at what they do, creating beautifully layered songs with intelligent lyrics. If you want some songs to check out, listen to The Grudge, Parabol/Parabola, and Triad. Recommended.
014028009X|5.0|I can't see why anyone would give this book any less than 5 stars.  I'd give it more if I could.<br />I love the format of the book, how it is all written as a diary.  The heroine is as wacky as they get, and Helen Fielding really hits the nail on what women have issues with. After I read this book I immediately bought the sequel, which is equally as good.  <br />If you're a woman, you definitely have to read this book.  It's fun, light, summer reading, and it goes really quick too.  I just have to say I was never much of a book person until I read this.  This book has re-introduced me to the wonderful world of books.
B00005J73X|5.0|Bon Jovi live on a CD? Well of course! This band finally has given its fans an experience to enjoy the concert expectation without the hassle of lining up for tickets, finding some place to park and then struggling to get the best seat in the house.  Music and energy even your best stereo system can learn to appreciate. Songs compiled in a fashionable manner, delivered in custom taste and presented with all best intentions. Myself, typically more a devotee for a band's studio recordings, this album proves the rare exception. For now, let's forget endless greatest hit compilations and take time to delve into the wild and rockin' music of the live concert. After hearing this diamond disc would anyone dare care to see any concert show again? No sense needing to go hear music that lasts for one night and ends only with a terrible hangover late into the next morning with some bruised left shoulder adding to the pain and discomfort. Instead, why not take your favorite gal (or guy) and make out by a cracklin' fire with champagne bubbling between your lips while imagining your favorite rock band has made a special effort to perform live at your abode especially for you? Perfect example of how both technology and musicians' awareness can perpetrate the live show straight to your home or portable CD player without making ya feel like you're just some other bumped head in a crowd.
0385335482|4.0|I saw this book and just HAD to read it... because I myself have to confess: I'm a shopaholic.  And it's actually rather scary how much Rebecca Bloomwood and I have in common.  I can't refuse a sale, I've paid off credit cards with others before, etc...<br />However, this book goes beyond the 'confessions of a shopaholic'.  It's the story of a financial journalist who is obviously unhappy with her job and uses shopping as a pick-me-up.  She is a woman who is very intelligent and capable but does not try very hard until something comes up that actually interests her.  And then when she actually tries, she finds out that it is actually possible for her to enjoy working, and that she doesn't have to be in debt forever as long as she is not in denial.<br />I really enjoyed reading this book, but I didn't give it 5 stars because I thought the author went just a teensy bit overboard with the shopaholic attitude sometimes.  The ending was satisfying, though, and made up for that. :)  All in all, I would recommend this book, as it is very amusing.
B00003CXPD|5.0|This was a fantastic movie.  It had a really good message and the story was wonderful!!  The acting and dialogue was magnificent!! This is one of my favorite movies, buy it!!

B000021XR5|5.0|Once again, STP, one of the last bands with any talent at all that is still recieving mainstream attention, delivers a carefully honed set of lyrically and musically superior songs. <br />From the thunderous opening track &quot;Down&quot; to the brooding &quot;Atlanta&quot;, the band is ultra tight and precise, lavishing each individual note with a type of magic that I am unable to describe with mere words...you've just got to listen to it for yourself. <br />The usual consensus among other reviewers seems to be dividing this album into two halves: the &quot;hard songs&quot; (Down, Heaven &amp; Hotrods, Pruno, No Way Out, Sex &amp; Violence, MC5), and the &quot;mellow songs&quot; (Church On Tuesday, Sour Girl, Glide, I Got You, Atlanta). However, I feel that in order to enjoy the musical ecstacy that is &quot;No 4&quot;, the listener must put all these shallow generalizations aside and take in each song in its own context. Only then will the true effects begin to take hold of your mind and soul, wrapping them in luscious, sweet incense and hallucination, taking you somewhere even more loveley than Heaven for 42 minutes<br />Please buy and hear this album. If you somehow are able to evade its appeal, give it away or sell it to a pawnshop or something. Then maybe someone else will have the chance to experience musical perfection.
6305827079|4.0|Great video, but some people say a few songs have been removed.  It is also implied by the trailer before the movie and Elvis' rehearsals (can't help believin, sweet caroline, 20 days and nights, bridge over troubled water). That's a shame if it is true to do that with a special edition.  Otherwise would have given 5 stars.  Elvis looks and sounds great.  Just pretend gives me gooseflesh.  I will buy the live album with the same name, which seems to feature the songs cut here.  Can't help believin is a great track, at least I will have it on cd.
B000056N8X|2.0|I love highlander; I loved the show, I loved the movies (in spite of their flaws), I'm even kind of a fan of Adrian Paul and Christopher Lambert.  I was so excited about this movie that I couldn't wait for it to come out. Having said all that, I (regrettably) have no choice but to pan this movie.  Big time.  Sure, their were some good sword fights, but it was nothing better than what you would see in any episode of the Highlander TV series.  There were a few good lines, but nothing better than what you would see on TV. What made the movie really bad was the plot.  It was convoluted, confusing, and had huge gaps that blew my mind with their stupidity.  Example:  at the end, Joe shows up out of nowhere and kills the guy who is about to kill Duncan.  What!! where did he come from?  Why was that scene even in the movie? To sum up Highlander:Endgame (which doesn't end anything, except my love for all things Highlander); this feels like a fair episode of the Highlander TV series that got badly out of control and somehow became a movie.
B000002UAO|5.0|This was the first Beatle album I ever bought so it has a very special spot in my heart.  In my opinion it is also one of their finest records ever.  It was definetly a turning point for the fab four as they matured in their roles as musicians and song writers. <br />The album kicks off with the awesome DRIVE MY CAR followed by the wonderful NORWEGIAN WOOD.  After that is the groovy YOU WON'T SEE ME and then the quirky NOWHERE MAN.  Next up is a George Harrison gem THINK FOR YOURSELF then a very cool tune THE WORD.  The album slows down with MICHELLE a peaceful song, but is followed by WHAT GOES ON one of Ringo's greatest vocal performances. Next is the beautiful GIRL then one of my favourite Beatle tunes I'M LOOKING THROUGH YOU. After that is the awesome IN MY LIFE followed by two great rockers WAIT and IF I NEEDED SOMEONE.  The album closes with the peachy RUN FOR YOUR LIFE.<br />After you have heard this album you will know what I mean by great song writing.  This album is very pure just four guys playing great rock 'n roll music!   I rank this album with REVOLVER and ABBEY ROAD which are 2 of my favourite Beatles albums but this one is very special to me.  Get it! buy it! borrow it off your friend!  Just make sure you don't miss this one because it's wonderful!  Highly recommended!
B00000J7JO|5.0|Californication is a wonderful experience, through and through.  Every single song on this album is perfect and there are no &quot;bad&quot; songs.  It's just an awesome album.  If you want a really powerful, well-written album, buy Californication.
B00000GAGR|5.0|for all of you people that dont like bonjovi thats your problem but so far i like every one of his albums ive ever heard and im proud of it and 14.i like all of bon jovi's music but this one the most.i like it not only cuz it is bon jovi but also becuase i think he put a lot of effort into this album.if anyone needs info on bon jovi remember this:hes good,hott,and rox.
B00005LKHW|3.0|Even though I disagree with the way the movie dealt with the Father-Son relationship (you know, the father shows his son sex magazines!!), I do agree that fathers should be very widely open with their sons taking into consideration different levels of age.  One other thing, I don't like the idea of making virginity like the middle east crisis.  It is something very simple, and when right time comes, it disappears.  We should remove the idea from teenagers' minds.
B00000IAU3|5.0|This CD is definately worth buying.  Dido's rich clear voice and catchy melodies will keep you listening to her CD over and over again.  This is one of those CDs that you can listen to often and not get sick of.  Her songs are beautifully crafted and sung.
B00005J79H|3.0|Acoustic albums by rock bands normally give us the opportunity to listen to normally electrified tracks in a new fashion. But the Scorpions choose to play mostly their ballads (of which they write WAY too many), which sound almost identical to the original tracks. For those of us waiting for the Scorpions to come to their senses and put out a solid hard rocking album, well, we will continue to wait. But it seems the band has permanently gone into a much softer direction. The album is not all that bad, it's just not all that good either. Most of the songs sound way too wimpy such as &quot;I Wanted to Cry (But the Tears Wouldn't Come)&quot;, the title alone makes me nauseous. &quot;The Zoo&quot;, the opening track, is a standout with a good arrangement and rocking groove, but the classic &quot;Rock You Like a Hurricane&quot; sounds incredibly lame, the song does NOT transfer well to the acoustic arrangement. However, on the plus side Klaus Meine's vocals are still in top form and there's an interesting cover of Kansas' &quot;Dust In The Wind&quot; with a more upbeat tempo. In closing, recommended for die-hard Scorpions fans only.
B00005B36H|5.0|I have to admit, by this time last year I was getting pretty impatient waiting for the new Tool album. It seemed like this album would never come out, but, after dozens of delays, Lateralus is finally here. At first listen I was not impressed at all. It seemed like sort of an empty album for the first 5 tracks. &quot;The Grudge&quot; didn't really offer anything new to us Tool fans and a few of the songs that followed it weren't even really songs. But after my second listen of the album's best song, &quot;The Patient,&quot; I was hooked. Maynard's voice has really improved and he has much more melody now and isn't always as aggressive. Just about every song on here is perfect. Some may get bored because of the length of the songs and the fillers that surround them, but really, this album wouldn't have worked without those elements. &quot;Parabol&quot; and &quot;Parabola&quot; are probably two of the most noteworthy tracks, &quot;Parabol&quot; is a laid back, mellow track while &quot;Parabola&quot; is a rip-roaring, grinding song, hence, these songs hold true to the titles of their names. The last track on the album, &quot;Faaip De Oiad&quot; is probably the only filler I enjoy listening to, and is kind of amusing too. This CD is pretty much in the same vein as Aenima, but with more melody. If you didn't like Mer De Noms or were left hungry with Salival, you will definetly enjoy Lateralus.
B000001F5A|4.0|After listening to and enjoying the Blade runner soundtrack by Vangelis I Purchased Antarctica. The emotion in the music as well as the intense crisp feel, remind me of the visuals in the movie of the same title. I had bought and listened to the cd B4 seeing the film, i think that was a good thing...If you like film scores from out door theme films and or have enjoyed past Vangelis CD's then Antarctica is worth a listen....try it in quiet place with suround sound and closed eyes, its like winter but without the cold toes!
0808514628|4.0|This book is a bittersweet novel about a girl growing up in Brooklyn in the early 1900s.  Even though her family is poor they still know what is important in life.  All the characters come to life in this book.  Francie is described from ages 11-16.  I like her character better as a child than a teenager.  This is a very well written book.  I would recommend that every American should read it for a taste of a different life style.
B000002AZ8|4.0|This is Pearl Jam's foruth record, and their worst. However, it is by far the most alternative of their records. Featuring an eclectic mix of songs, Vitalogy is based on several great songs, with filler in between. Mind you, this is high quality filler, but it's still filler.   &quot;Not For You,&quot; stands out as the record's best and most interesting song. Vedder is in top form on this cut, and is partickullarly angry. His anger is complemented by great guitar and drum work by the band.   &quot;Betterman,&quot; is another of the showcased songs here, and is just barely surpassed by &quot;Not For You,&quot; as the best track on the record. &quot;Betterman,&quot; is a fun song to listen to, and is atypical Pearl Jam, and a welcome break from the darkness and anger on the rest of this record.   Though it is their only 4 star record (all the others being 5 stared), Vitalogy is still a good investment of your $15
6301976622|2.0|Spectacular sets. Peter Ustinov steals movies as Nero. Leo Genn always the finest supporting actor. Robert Taylor is wooden as usual.  Deborah Kerr just stands around looking prettily made up. Almost 3 hour film is just too long. Contents do not justify it's length.  Worth seeing once.
0345350499|5.0|When I first discovered The Mists of Avalon, I had very little interest in Arthurian legend.  I was very curious, however, to read this novel.  While it seemed a bit daunting, it ended up being a magnificent read.  It was so engrossing I would find myself lost for hours, zooming through hundreds of pages without even noticing the time going by.  <br />The Mists of Avalon brings to life a civilization shrouded in mystery.  Since very little is known on the &quot;Dark Ages&quot;, Marion Zimmer Bradley decided to write the novel from a very fresh, and yet, plausible perspective.  Her wonderful tale of Arthurian life is told from the point of view of the women in the story, and often it is the women with the least-expected roles in traditional Arthurian legend who are the key characters. It also tells the perspective from that of the non-Christian one.  It is not your average novel, by any means.<br />While it is classified as a Science Fiction novel, it is not outlandish and completely unrealistic.  [While not completely realistic, either.] <br />The very least I can say about this novel is that it is a masterpiece.  Mists of Avalon is a comprehensive study of life in the time of the Arthurian legend.  If you enjoy novels of a different era, that completely sweep you out of your present situation, this is the book for you.  This novel is full of fantasy, legend, and intelligence.<br />This is my all-time favorite novel, and one I will read again and again.
B00001ZUGJ|5.0|Its so good I only bought my TV-300$,DVD SYSTEM-175$,AND THE MATRIX DVD AND HAVENT RENTED OR BOUGHT ANYNEW CDS
B00005JK93|5.0|I Saw the movie twice in just a few weeks (SF Intl Film Fest and SF GLB&amp;T Film Fest) it was so wonderful.  Both showings were blessed with Mitchell presenting the film and then a short Q&amp;A session after.  It's a great and fun musical (lines are spoken, but songs are performed throughout).  Mitchell plays Hedwig, a kind of somber, witty, and controlling kind of gay boy mixed up into a sex-change glam rocker.  The dialogue is *hilarious* (as drag demands, but without the often common (and, dare I say, trite) Super Bitchiness) -- you just keep cracking up.  There's also this whole wonderful story of the Origin of Love, four-legged creatures split by the Gods, primarily told very creatively through cartoon sequences.  But Hedwig seems so real and full of life throughout -- with hope, sadness, anger, betrayal, and love.  The song lyrics are also hysterical.  It's a great creative indie film.  If you like camp, rock, gender, and queer all rolled into one (and shouldn't you, after all ;-) then this is the Film for you!
B000053VAF|5.0|...and why most of it sits on a cutting room floor.<br />On the Special Edition DVD, there is a scene where Bethany, who works in a Planned Parenthood clinic, discusses her past with a young woman who is prepared for her third abortion.  This is a scene where the most skilled and political writer tempts violent retribution from the masses on either side of the abortion issue.   Bethany, played by Linda Fiorentino, describes in visual imagery most suited for a novel, her own back story or reason for being in her particular line of work.  In this 3 minute speech, you see the power of Kevin Smith as a writer.  It may not be best suited for the big screen where we now expect million dollar variations of explosions and intercourse every Memorial Day weekend, but it is a bit of Hollywood driftwood preserved for us backwater types who don't get to screen View Askew movies at parties or film festivals before they are cut to commercial specs.  <br />Had this scene taken the Dragnet &quot;I've been down that road and you just don't know&quot; approach it wouldn't have worked.  Had it been forced and ditatched, it would have been artificial...but this one scene, a minor part of the 2-disk set, proves that Smith is destined for greatness, perhaps he is the one of our generation who can turn his skill to the printed page to create that mythological Great American Novel that has baffled and eluded the Gen X ilk of the early 90s.  <br />As Smith and Co. restate in their introduction of each deleted scene, most of what was cut from the philosophical/religious treatise &quot;Dogma&quot; was because it added too much info to already established scenes.  This is true and reminds me that Smith could be a great novelist should the urge strike. He has a gift for narrative and could write a vivid first-person novel without fear of being pretentious.<br />If you hated Dogma, or have a religious bias against it, these words won't mean anything anyway.  But &quot;Dogma&quot; is more about faith and love of God than most so-called &quot;christian&quot; movies out there.  Its about Ideas and faith and renewing our relationship with God than about obeying and swearing our oath to the ancient, faceless patriarch.  This is the only DVD version of the film you should own and only because it does justice both to the film and to the reasons behinds its production.<br />Nice work, Kevin and Scott.  Keep it coming.  You're both ready for much more.
6303029027|5.0|&quot;A Bronx Tale&quot; delivers with many life messages.  Along the way, Calogero or &quot;C&quot; gets involved with Sonny, a local mob boss.  C's father, Lorenzo doesn't like the fact that his son is with Sonny a lot.  De Niro does a magnificent job with his acting as well as Chazz Palminteri.  There is a racial event between the Italians and the Blacks that is depicted very realistic.  It is set during the 1960's and portrays an average Italian neighborhood.  Calogero must pick between Sonny's fast life or his father's working life.  This is one of my favorite mob movies that keeps on delivering scence after scene.
0553278398|5.0|There's no such thing as a bad Foundation novel (as long as you don't count the new trilogy by people other than Asimov).  &quot;Prelude&quot; is no exception.  It is exactly what its name implies, the origins of Asimov's great Foundation.  When I reread the series recently, I started with this book, and it really helped make the whole series more complete.  It is crafted with the same care for detail as the rest of the series.  The characters a great, the story is great, and it is just great.  Did I mention that it's a great book?<br />The Foundation series is Asimov at his finest, and there isn't much reading better than that.  If you're a fan of the series, read this.  If you're new to the series, read this and all the others.  It is definitely worth your time.
B000003TAW|5.0|First off, let me just say that I have had this album for five days and it is already my favorite album; topping deftone's white pony and tool's aenima. It means more to me than any other of my 184 cd's. Now, my favorite track on this album is &quot;the world has turned and left me here&quot;. its also my all time favorite. Because it talks about young love. he met a girl somewhere, they fell in love, and she left him. then he talks about missin her. I love this song because it perfecty describes me and my girlfriend. well, enough about that. My 2'nd favorite is tied between &quot;only in dreams&quot; and &quot;holiday&quot;. I also love &quot;my name is jonas&quot;, &quot;say it ain't so&quot;. and &quot;in the garage&quot;. I love all the tracks but especially the above mentioned. Every song is great, and this album definitely deserves 5 stars, but i just wish the booklet was bigger. if you aren't one of the millions of people who have this album already, then buy it today. and you can buy it at &quot;K&quot; or &quot;W&quot; Mart  for cheap without fear of being edited because weezer doesn't cuss, and thats what i did. and by the way, this album is 50 times better than the green album.
0812550706|5.0|I first read this book many years ago when I was but a boy, and I can honestly say that this is the book that turned me into an avid reader. The book has obvious appeal for younger readers (Ender, and most of the main characters are children of remarkable ability), but it is by no means young adult fiction. Card uses the childrens point of view to look at humanity in a new and fresh way, in a way that escaped me until later in life. I've reread the book more times than I care to mention here, and it always provides me with new insights.<br />Probably the most important aspect of the novel is that it just expounds coolness. The plot is incredible and deftly crafted, the characters ring true and win the reader's heart, and every kid and adult reader wants to go to, or wants have gone to Battle School after reading ENDER'S GAME.<br />I've made many people read this book, and every single one of them has loved it. So now I'm making you read it, and you'll love it too.
B000002UV9|4.0|A solid album from start to finish. The guitar and drumming musicianship is simply amazing. It's too bad that Queensryche has not been able to duplicate an album of this quality. (Operation: Mindcrime is the only one that comes even CLOSE)

B00005B36H|3.0|Let me start off by saying that that musicianship of this album is fantastic. The drumming is precise and amazing, and singing is wonderfully done. However, these things alone do not make a good album. One must also use CONCISE, STRUCTURED music writing to keep the listener interested as the song develops. And this is where Lateralus is lacking.<br />First of, the album is 78 min, 59 sec long, but that should have been shortened to about 60 min. There are too many pointless interlude tracks that add nothing to the mood or meaning of the album. And did anyone notice at one point they wasted a whole two minutes between tracks! Just two minutes of pure silence. That is just plain stupid.<br />Now, to the Actual songs. I can agree with the philosophy that long songs can be interesting and fun to listen to, AS LONG AS THEY ARE WELL-DEVELOPED. A good example of this is Dream Theater, whose 8 min songs are always a joy to listen to. Unfortunately, THESE SONGS ARE NOT WELL-DEVELOPED. MIX THINGS UP A BIT GUYS!! I'm sorry, but it's IMMATURE SONG-WRITING to simply dwell on the same guitar riff for minutes on end without some kind of change or development. <br />Now, these guys need to get a producer ASAP who will sharpen their song writing skills so they can write songs that are much more meaningfull. <br />Bottom line: It seems like they wrote long songs just for the sake of having a long song, and not because they had something to say.

B00005B6NC|3.0|I rented this movie after hearing it was one of the better sci-fi films made recently, along with a pretty decent horror backdrop. Also, with Vin Diesel starring in this movie, I wanted to see it, just because he did a great job in 'Saving Private Ryan'. Apparently this was a low budget science fiction movie, and it was quite noticeable. Although the special effects were good, they were nowhere near the standards of 'The Mummy' or 'The Phantom Menace'. But don't get me wrong, they worked good enough to make me want to keep watching. <br />I enjoyed the story in 'Pitch Black'. It basically revolves around a ship that crashes onto another planet right before a solar eclipse. To escape safely, they must power up another ship before they are attacked and killed by &quot;creatures of the night&quot;. Vin Diesel plays a murderer who can see through the darkness and is forced to guide their way. <br />So far this sounds good, eh? Well, then why did I give it three stars only? Because of this, of course: as an aspiring director/screenwriter, I felt the script was kind of weak, and could've been better. The film seemed to drag on at points as they went back and forth through the desert, and something bothered me about the lighting. I assume it was done purposely--just as the picture was darkened in Tim Burton's 'Sleepy Hollow'--but it didn't look good to me. All in all, if the script would've been stronger and some scenes shortened, this movie would easily earn four stars. Rent this at least once and decide for yourself if you like it or not, but don't expect the next 'Alien', 'cause you're not gonna find it.
6304595247|3.0|This version of Wuthering Heights was worth watching -- if only to see Ralph Fiennes in yet another period movie -- at his best dramatic/moody/viscious persona.  This is how I like to see him perform.  Not the character he portrayed in Oscar and Lucinda.  This is Ralph Fiennes at his best -- and he convinced me of Heathcliffe's raging jealousy, dogged pursuance of his goal to destroy all that was left of Cathy's legacy as well as his (few and far between shots of) devotion and passion for Cathy herself.  I have seen all three versions (the ones worth seeing) of Wuthering Heights.  My favorite is still the one with Timothy Dalton (yes, believe it or not) and I cannot remember the woman who played Cathy (a British actress). This movie came out in the 70's and was fantastic.  Timothy Dalton was young and a perfect brooding Heathcliffe.  The music, screenplay, adaptation and everything was perfect.  Unfortunately, this movie isn't even listed.  Juliette Binoche is one of my favorite actresses -- but this part was not for her, IMHO.  She was not expressive enough or convincing as Cathy.  The house wins -- the best Wuthering Heights I've seen yet!!  And Sinead O'Connor was wonderful as Bronte -- her voice was monotone as she described the day she discovered The Heights and I enjoyed getting into that mood to watch the movie very much.  I would recommend seeing this version - but please try to find the version with Timothy Dalton if you're a real Wuthering Heights fan like me!
1586210912|5.0|If you have a family history of middle-class existence and want to break the cycle, read this book. I also recommend giving it as a graduation gift to all nephews and nieces. Spread the word. It is possible to retire young and enjoy life 24/7!
0452282152|5.0|I first came across the book as I was cleaning someone's office at work.  Later I saw the book at the airport and bought it.  As a person who has great love for books, I have never read a book completely through.  While I was reading this book, I saw pictures of her in Chicago while visiting and finally even bought the poster.  As an artist myself, it gave me the perspective of how others find your work so intriguing.  The language is beautifully written and almost sings its own tune.  Through poverty and tragedy the young lady finds herself in the home of Vermeer as a maid.  Simply a page turner.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|I have never seen a better movie in my entire life.  I fell in love with the soundtrack also.  The music is very moving.  Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman put so much feeling into their parts, especially with their singing.  I definitely recommend this movie to anyone willing to see it.  It is definitely worth the money.  I look forward to seeing it many more times.

B00000JGHM|5.0|Maybe some of the plot is a little farfetched but it's a movie!  But what this movie does is develop a BUNCH of characters that have both admirable and despicable traits.  How many movies do that?  It doesn't glamorize violence but shows it's a hard choice and it doesn't glamorize crime.  It shows the good and the bad of each character's choices.  Fascinating!  And the DeNiro-Pacino stuff is like a shortened version of The Killer's interplay.  Nothing wrong with that!
